Since our meeting last year, we\nhave had several\nchanges in Board leadership and identified\nthree excellent candidates for election to the\nBoard. Last August, I was elected by my fellow\ndirectors as Chairman of the Board and Wayne\nHewett became Chair of the Governance and\nNominating Committee, and\nlast April, Ted Craver became Chair of the\nAudit Committee.\n\nAll of us on the Board are pleased to nominate\nfor election as directors Richard K. Davis,\nCeCelia \u0093CeCe\u0094 G. Morken, and Felicia F.\nNorwood, who will bring diverse and valued\nexperience to our Board. Mr. Davis brings\nnearly 40 years of financial services\nexperience, including as Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer of U.S.\nBancorp. Ms. Morken is a recognized leader in\nthe technology and digital space from her\nyears of experience in the computer software\nindustry. Ms. Norwood brings extensive senior\nexecutive business and operational experience\nin the highly\nregulated healthcare industry and in the\ngovernment sector, including having\nresponsibility for a significant portion of\nthe P&L of a major health care benefits\ncompany.\n\nCEO Charlie Scharf and the Operating Committee\npushed forward on Wells Fargo\u0092s continued\ntransformation in 2021. The Company has made\nprogress on a\nnumber of fronts, including strengthening our\nrisk and control infrastructure, improving our\nfinancial results, and making leadership\nchanges as we continue to support our business\nand priorities. We also continued our efforts\nto enhance the\nexperience of our customers and increased\nengagement with the communities we serve, at\nboth the national and local level. The Board\nremains focused on its oversight of the\nOperating Committee\u0092s execution of this\ntransformation, and supporting\nmanagement accountability for meeting the high\nexpectations that they have for themselves,\nthat we have for them as a Board, and that our\nregulators have for us as a Company. The\nchanges that the Company has made, coupled\nwith the continued economic\nrecovery, give us confidence about our\ncompetitive position entering 2022. The\nCompany\u0092s top priority remains building the\nappropriate risk and control infrastructure\nwhich is foundational and critical to our\nfuture. In addition, in 2022 we\nwill continue to oversee efforts to drive the\nCompany\u0092s business performance and enhance the\nexperiences of our customers, increase the\nengagement of our employees and deepen the\nrelationships in our communities.\n\n2\n\nAs in recent years, this year\u0092s annual meeting\nwill be held virtually to protect the health\nand safety\nof our shareholders, employees, directors, and\nother meeting participants. We had more\nparticipants and the opportunity to answer\nmore questions at the 2020 and 2021 annual\nmeetings than in prior years, and we again\nlook forward to an informative\nand engaging meeting with our shareholders.\n\nThank you for your continued investment in,\nand support of, Wells Fargo.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSteven D.

Each year, our Board affirmatively\ndetermines the independence of each director\nand each nominee for election as a director.\nUnder New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules,\nin order for a director to be considered\nindependent, our Board must determine that\nthe director has no material relationship\nwith our Company (either directly or as a\npartner, shareholder, or officer of an\norganization that has a relationship with our\nCompany). To assist our Board in making its\nindependence determinations, our Board\nadopted the Director Independence Standards\nappended to our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines. These Director Independence\nStandards consist of the NYSE\u0092s \u0093bright line\u0094\nstandards of independence as well as\nadditional standards, known as categorical\nstandards of independence, adopted by our\nBoard. The Director Independence Standards\nare available on our website at: https://www.\nwellsfargo.com/about/corporate/governance.\nBased on the Director Independence Standards,\nour Board considered information in early\n2022 regarding banking and financial\nservices, commercial, charitable, familial,\nand other relationships between each director\nand director nominee, his or her respective\nimmediate family members, and/or certain\nentities affiliated with such directors,\ndirector nominees, and immediate family\nmembers, on the one hand, and our Company, on\nthe other, to determine the director\u0092s or\ndirector nominee\u0092s independence. After\nreviewing the information presented to it and\nconsidering the recommendation of the GNC,\nour Board determined that, except for Charles\nW. Scharf, who is a Wells Fargo employee, all\nother current directors and director nominees\nare independent under the Director\nIndependence Standards. The Board previously\ndetermined that Donald M. James and Charles\nH. Noski were each independent directors\nprior to their retirement from our Board in\nApril 2021 and September 2021, respectively.\nIn connection with making its independence\ndeterminations, our Board considered the\nfollowing relationships, as well as the\nrelationships with a director described under\nthe Related Person Transactionssection of\nthis proxy statement, under the Director\nIndependence Standards and determined that\nall of these relationships satisfied the NYSE\n\u0093bright line\u0094 standards of independence and\nwere immaterial under our Board\u0092s categorical\nstandards of independence:\n                                              \n                   Our Company\u0092s banking and   \n                   other subsidiaries had     \n                   ordinary course banking    \n                   and financial services     \n                   relationships in 2021      \n                   with certain of our        \n                   directors, some of their   \n                   immediate family members,  \n  Banking and      and/or certain entities    \n  Financial        affiliated with such       \n  Services         directors and their        \n  Relationships    immediate family members,  \n                   all of which were on       \n                   substantially the same     \n                   terms as those             \n                   available at the time for  \n                   comparable transactions    \n                   with persons not           \n                   affiliated with our        \n                   Company and complied with  \n                   applicable banking laws.   \n                   The spouse of a sibling    \n                   of Wayne M.

The GNC also\nincorporates this broad view of diversity\ninto its director nomination process by\ntaking into account all of the factors above.\nIn implementing its practice of considering\ndiversity, the GNC may place more emphasis on\nattracting or retaining director nominees\nwith certain specific skills or experience,\nsuch as industry, regulatory, operational, or\nfinancial expertise, depending on the\ncircumstances and the composition of our\nBoard at the time. Gender, race, and ethnic\ndiversity also have been, and will continue\nto be, a priority for the GNC and our Board\nin its director nomination process because\nthe GNC and our Board believe that it is\nessential that the composition of our Board\nappropriately reflects the diversity of the\ncommunities we serve. The GNC believes that\nit has been successful in its efforts over\nthe years to promote gender, race, and ethnic\ndiversity on our Board. The GNC and our Board\nbelieve that our director nominees for\nelection at our 2022 annual meeting bring to\nour Board a variety of different backgrounds,\nskills, professional and industry experience,\nand other personal qualities, attributes, and\nperspectives that contribute to the overall\ndiversity of our Board. The charts below show\nthe diversity of our director nominees. The\nBoard expects to maintain its focus on Board\ndiversity as well as other desired\nqualifications and experience identified by\nthe Board in future director recruitment\nefforts. The GNC and our Board will continue\nto monitor the effectiveness of their\npractice of considering diversity through\nassessing the results of any new director\nsearch efforts, and through the GNC\u0092s and our\nBoard\u0092s annual self-evaluation processes in\nwhich directors discuss and evaluate the\ncomposition and functioning of our Board and\nits committees.\n                               \n  18    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nCorporate Governance\n\nStrong Independent Board Leadership Our Board\nLeadership Structure Taking into account\nfeedback from our investors, Wells Fargo has\nhad an independent Chairman separate from the\nCEO role since 2016. The Board has adopted,\nand annually reviews and approves, well-\ndefined authority and responsibilities of the\nindependent Chairman as reflected in the\nchart below. In August 2021, Charles H. Noski\nretired as Chairman of the Board and remained\nas a director until September 2021. The Board\nelected Steven D. Black as our independent\nChairman effective August 9, 2021. In\naddition to having an independent Chairman,\nour Board has a significant majority of\nindependent directors (13 of the 14 director\nnominees are independent under the Director\nIndependence Standards) and all members of\nour standing Board Committees are\nindependent. Annual Independent Chairman\nSelection Our Board\u0092s GNC is responsible for\nperiodically evaluating our Board\u0092s\nleadership structure and, based on the\nrecommendation of the GNC, our Board selects\nthe independent Chairman annually. Our Board\nbelieves that currently, our Board leadership\nstructure with an independent Chairman with\nclearly defined authority and\nresponsibilities shown in the chart below,\nprovides strong

Director\nElection Standard Our By-Lawsprovide that\ndirectors will be elected using a majority\nvote standard in an uncontested director\nelection (i.e., an election where, as of the\nrecord date, the only nominees are those\nnominated by our Board, such as at this\nmeeting). Under this standard, a nominee for\ndirector will be elected to our Board if the\nvotes cast for the nominee exceed the votes\ncast against the nominee. However, directors\nwill be elected by a plurality of the votes\ncast in a contested election. Under Delaware\nlaw, directors continue in office until their\nsuccessors are elected and qualified or until\ntheir earlier resignation or removal. Our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines provide that\nour Board will nominate for election and\nappoint to fill Board vacancies or newly\ncreated directorships only those directors who\nhave tendered or agreed to tender an\nirrevocable resignation that would become\neffective upon their failure to receive the\nrequired vote for election and Board\nacceptance of the tendered resignation. Each\ndirector nominee named in this proxy statement\nhas tendered an irrevocable resignation as a\ndirector in accordance with our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, which resignation will\nbecome effective if he or she fails to receive\nthe required vote for election at the annual\nmeeting and our Board accepts his or her\nresignation. Our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines also provide that the GNC will\nconsider the tendered resignation of a\ndirector who fails to receive the required\nnumber of votes for election, as well as any\nother offer to resign that is conditioned upon\nBoard acceptance, and recommend to our Board\nwhether or not to accept such resignation. The\nGNC, in deciding what action to recommend, and\nour Board, in deciding what action to take,\nmay consider any factors they deem relevant.\nThe director whose resignation is under\nconsideration will abstain from participating\nin any decision of the GNC or our Board\nregarding such resignation. If our Board does\nnot accept the resignation, the director will\ncontinue to serve until his or her successor\nis elected and qualified. Our Board will\npublicly disclose its decision on the\nresignation within 90 days after certification\nof the stockholder voting results. Director\nNomination Process The GNC is responsible for\nleading the director nomination process, which\nincludes identifying, evaluating, and\nrecommending for nomination candidates for\nelection as directors, regardless of who\nnominates a candidate for consideration. The\ngoal of the GNC\u0092s nominating process is to\nassist our Board in attracting and retaining\ncompetent individuals with the requisite\nleadership, executive management, financial,\nindustry, and other expertise and who will act\nas directors in the best interests of our\nCompany and its shareholders.\n                               \n  20    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nCorporate Governance Director Nomination\nProcess\n                              \n  2022 Proxy Statement    21  \n                              \nCorporate Governance\n\nDirector Re-NominationProcess As discussed\nunder the Comprehensive Annual Evaluation of\nBoard Effectivenesssection of this proxy\nstatement, the GNC considers the results of\nthe Board\u0092s annual self-evaluation, including\nthe individual contributions of directors to\nthe work of the Board and its Committees, in\nconnection with its determination to nominate\nexisting directors for reelection at each\nannual meeting of shareholders.

All of the Board\u0092s\nsix standing Committees have new Chairs since\nJanuary 2017. The GNC also reviews a director\nqualifications and experience matrix for each\nBoard committee to assist it in evaluating\nthe collective experience of directors on\neach Committee in light of the particular\ncommittee\u0092s oversight responsibilities. The\ncollective qualifications and experience of\ndirectors on each committee are reflected in\nthe charts under the Board Committee\nComposition and Oversight\nResponsibilitiessection of this proxy\nstatement. The Board has adopted a charter\nfor each standing Board Committee that\naddresses its purpose, authority, and\nresponsibilities and contains other\nprovisions relating to, among other matters,\nmembership and meetings. Each Committee may\nform and delegate, in its discretion, all or\na portion of its authority to subcommittees\nof one or more of its members. As required by\nits charter, each Committee annually reviews\nand assesses its charter\u0092s adequacy and\nreviews its performance, and is responsible\nfor overseeing reputation risk related to its\nresponsibilities. Committees may recommend to\nour Board charter amendments at any time.\nAdditional information about our Board\u0092s six\nstanding Committees, including their key\nresponsibilities, appears below and

One type of management\ncommittee, a governance committee, is a\ndecision-making body that operates for a\nparticular purpose and may be overseen\ndirectly by, and/or report to, a Board\ncommittee. In accordance with its charter,\neach management governance committee is\nexpected to discuss, document, and make\ndecisions regarding high-priority and\nsignificant risks, emerging risks, risk\nacceptances, and risks and issues escalated to\nit; review and monitor progress related to\ncritical and high-risk issues and remediation\nefforts, including lessons learned; and report\nkey challenges, decisions, escalations, other\nactions, and open issues as appropriate.\nEnterprise Risk & Control Committee The\nEnterprise Risk & Control Committee (ERCC) is\na management governance committee that governs\nthe management of all risk types. The ERCC is\ninformed about risk and control issues,\naddresses escalated risks and issues, and\nactively oversees risk controls. It also\nprovides regular updates to the Risk Committee\nregarding current and emerging risks and\nsenior management\u0092s assessment of the\neffectiveness of the Company\u0092s risk management\nprogram. The ERCC is co-chaired by the CEO and\nCRO, with membership comprised of the heads of\nour five principal lines of business (Consumer\n& Small Business Banking, Consumer Lending,\nCommercial Banking, Corporate & Investment\nBanking, and Wealth & Investment Management)\nand certain enterprise functions heads. The\nChief Auditor or a designee attends all ERCC\nmeetings. The ERCC has a direct escalation\npath to the Risk Committee. It also escalates\ninterest rate risks and issues to the Finance\nCommittee, and certain human capital risks and\nissues to the HRC. In addition, the CRO has\nthe authority to escalate anything directly to\nthe Board. Line of Business and\nEnterpriseFunctionRisk andControlCommittees\nEach principal line of business and enterprise\nfunction has a risk and control committee,\nwhich is a management governance committee\nwith a mandate that aligns with the ERCC, but\nwith its scope limited to the respective\nprincipal line of business or enterprise\nfunction. These committees focus on, and\nconsider, risks that the respective line of\nbusiness or enterprise function generates and\nis responsible for managing, and the controls\neach principal line of business or enterprise\nfunction is expected to have in place. Risk\nType and Risk Topic Committees In addition to\neach risk and control committee, management\ngovernance committees dedicated to specific\nrisk types or risk topics also report to the\nERCC to help provide more comprehensive\ngovernance of risks. Everyone Manages Risk\nEvery employee creates risk in the course of\nperforming daily activities and is responsible\nfor managing risk. Managing risk is everyone\u0092s\nresponsibility and in connection with that\nresponsibility, every employee is required to\ncomply with applicable laws, regulations, and\nCompany policies.\n                              \n  2022 Proxy Statement    33  \n                              \nCorporate Governance\n                                              \n  Risk Operating Model \u0097 Roles and             \n  Responsibilities                            \n  The Company has three lines of defense to   \n  manage risk: the front line, Independent    \n  Risk Management, and Internal Audit.

The\nCompany\u0092s Risk Profile, risk capacity, Risk\nAppetite, and Risk Management\nEffectivenessare considered in the strategic\nplanning process, which is closely linked\nwith the Company\u0092s capital planning process.\nThe Company\u0092s Independent Risk Management\norganization participates in strategic\nplanning, providing challenge to, and\nindependent assessment of, the risks\nassociated with strategic initiatives.\nIndependent Risk Management also\nindependently assesses and challenges the\nimpact of the strategic plan on risk\ncapacity, Risk Appetite, and Risk Management\nEffectivenessat the principal line of\nbusiness, enterprise function, and aggregate\nCompany level. After review, the strategic\nplan is presented to the Board each year with\nIndependent Risk Management\u0092s evaluation.\nRisk and Culture Senior management sets the\n\u0093tone at the top\u0094 by supporting a strong\nculture, defined by the Company\u0092s\nexpectations, that guides how employees\nshould conduct themselves and make\ndecisions.The Board holds senior management\naccountable for establishing and maintaining\nthis culture and effectively managing risk.\nSenior management expects employees to speak\nup when they see something that could cause\nharm to the Company\u0092s customers, communities,\nemployees, shareholders, or reputation.\nBecause risk management is everyone\u0092s\nresponsibility, all employees are expected\nand empowered to challenge risk decisions\nwhen appropriate and to escalate their\nconcerns when they have not been addressed.\nEffective risk management is a central\ncomponent of employee performance\nevaluations. The Company\u0092s performance\nmanagement and incentive compensation\nprograms are designed to establish a balanced\nframework for risk and reward under core\nprinciples that employees are expected to\nknow and practice. The Board, through its\nHRC, plays an important role in overseeing\nand providing credible challenge to the\nCompany\u0092s performance management and\nincentive compensation programs. See the\nPerformance Management and Incentive\nCompensationsection in this proxy statement\nfor additional information on the ways in\nwhich performance evaluations and incentive\ncompensation decisions are tied to, and take\ninto account, effective risk management.\n                               \n  34    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nCorporate Governance\n\nManagement Succession Planning and\nDevelopment A primary responsibility of our\nBoard is identifying and developing executive\ntalent at our Company, particularly the CEO\nand other senior leaders of our Company. The\nBoard has assigned to the HRC, as set forth\nin its charter, the responsibility to oversee\nthe Company\u0092s talent management and\nsuccession planning process, including the\nCEO evaluation and succession planning. The\nBoard\u0092s Corporate Governance Guidelines\nrequire that the CEO and management annually\nreport to the HRC and the Board on succession\nplanning (including plans in the event of an\nemergency) and management development. The\nCorporate Governance Guidelines also require\nthat the CEO and management provide the HRC\nand the Board with an assessment of persons\nconsidered potential successors to certain\nsenior management positions at least once\neach year. The Board engages in an annual\nsuccession planning process through which it\nidentifies potential management successors.\nBeginning in 2021, our talent review process\nfor senior management roles also includes\ndiverse talent reviews for business and\nenterprise function groups across the\nCompany. In addition, in light of the\nCOVID-19pandemic, the HRC and the Board\nconducted emergency succession planning for\nthe CEO and other key executive roles in\nMarch 2020. As part of the ongoing management\nsuccession planning process, the HRC assesses\nemergency succession plans. As part of talent\nand succession planning, the Board uses\ndefined attributes for the qualities the\nBoard seeks in the CEO and other senior\nleaders. The HRC and the Board annually\nassess and update, as appropriate, those\nattributes as part of our succession planning\nprocess.\n                             \n  Annual Assessment Process  \n                             \n                              \n  2022 Proxy Statement    35  \n                              \nCorporate Governance\n\nComprehensive Annual\nEvaluation of Board\nEffectiveness Each\nyear, our Board\nconducts a\ncomprehensive self-\nevaluation in order to\nassess its own\neffectiveness, review\nour governance\npractices, and\nidentify areas for\nenhancement. Our\nBoard\u0092s annual self-\nevaluation also is a\nkey component of its\ndirector nomination\nprocess and succession\nplanning. The GNC, in\nconsultation with our\nindependent Chairman,\nreviews and determines\nthe overall process,\nscope, and content of\nour Board\u0092s annual\nself-evaluation\nprocess. The GNC has\ncontinued to enhance\nthe Board\u0092s self-\nevaluation process\nbased on director\nfeedback, best\npractices, experience,\nand regulatory\nexpectations. As\nprovided in their\nrespective charters,\neach of our Board\u0092s\nstanding Committees\nalso conducts a\nseparate self-\nevaluation process\nannually. Our Board\u0092s\nand each Committee\u0092s\nself-evaluation\nincludes a review of\nthe Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines\nand its Committee\ncharter, respectively,\nto consider any\nproposed changes. The\nGNC considers each\nyear whether to engage\na third party to\nassist the Board in\nconducting its self-\nevaluation. In each of\n2021, 2020, 2018 and\n2017, the Board\nengaged a third party\nto facilitate its\nannual self-\nevaluation. In 2020\nand again in 2021, the\nGNC and the Board\ndecided to engage\nSimpson Thacher &\nBartlett LLP to\nfacilitate the Board\u0092s\nand each Committee\u0092s\n2021 self-evaluations.\nThe process

One of the\nBoard\u0092s director nominees, Richard B. Payne,\nJr., will be age 74 at the time of the\nCompany\u0092s 2022 annual meeting. Consistent\nwith our disclosure made at the time Mr.\nPayne was initially elected to the Board in\nOctober 2019 and in connection with the\nBoard\u0092s nomination of him for election by\nshareholders at our 2020 and 2021 annual\nmeetings, the Board, based on the\nrecommendation of the GNC, determined to\nnominate Mr. Payne for election at the 2022\nannual meeting to serve as a director of the\nCompany in light of the particular skills and\nexperience that he brings to the Board. In\ndetermining that Mr. Payne\u0092s nomination is in\nthe best interests of the Company and its\nshareholders, the Board considered, among\nother factors, his substantial corporate and\ncommercial banking experience (which spans\napproximately 40 years), extensive knowledge\nof the bank regulatory environment for large\nfinancial institutions, and risk management\nand credit expertise. Mr. Payne is a member\nof the Risk Committee and the chair of its\nCredit Subcommittee. Mr. Payne regularly and\neffectively contributes as a member of the\nRisk Committee, and he has consistently\ndemonstrated strong, astute leadership as the\nchair of the Credit Subcommittee.

Director Orientation\nProcess and Continuing Education New Director\nOrientation All new directors on our Board\nreceive an orientation to the Company and\ntraining that is individually tailored,\ntaking into account the director\u0092s\nexperience, background, education and\ncommittee assignments. Our new director\norientation program is led by members of\nsenior management, in consultation with the\nindependent Chairman of our Board and each of\nour new directors, and covers a review of our\nfive principal lines of business, strategic\nplan, financial statements, risk management\nframework and significant risks, regulatory\nmatters, corporate governance and key\npolicies and practices (including our Code of\nEthics and Business Conduct), as well as the\nroles and responsibilities of our directors.\nOngoing Director Training The Board and its\nCommittees participate in and receive various\nforms of training and education throughout\nthe year, including business update sessions;\nmanagement presentations on the Company\u0092s\nbusinesses, services, and products; and\ninformation on\n                              \n  2022 Proxy Statement    41  \n                              \nCorporate Governance\n\nindustry trends, regulatory developments,\nbest practices, and emerging risks in the\nfinancial services industry. Other\neducational and reference materials on\ngovernance, regulatory, risk, and other\nrelevant topics are regularly included in\nBoard and Committee meeting materials and\nmaintained in an electronic library available\nto directors. Continuing Director Education\nWe also encourage our directors to attend\noutside director and other continuing\neducation programs and make available to\ndirectors information on director education\nprograms that might be of interest on\ndevelopments in our industry, corporate\ngovernance, regulatory requirements and\nexpectations, the economic environment, or\nother matters relevant to their duties as a\ndirector of our Company. Structure of our\nDirector Compensation Program The GNC and the\nBoard review our director compensation\nprogram annually. For 2021, the annual cash\nretainer remained unchanged since 2007 and\nthe annual equity award amount remained\nunchanged since 2015. 2021 Cash Compensation\nThe following table shows the components of\ncash compensation paid to non-\nemployeedirectors in 2021. Cash retainers and\nfees are paid quarterly in arrears. Any non-\nemployee director who joins the Board during\nthe year receives a prorated annual cash\nretainer.\n                                              \n  2021 Component         Amount\u00a0($)           \n  Annual Cash                         75,000  \n  Retainer                                    \n  Annual Independent                 250,000  \n  Chairman Retainer1                          \n  Annual Committee                            \n  Chair Fees                                  \n  Each of Audit and                   40,000  \n  Risk Committee                              \n  Each of CRC,                                \n  Finance Committee,                  25,000  \n  GNC and HRC                                 \n  Regular or Special                          \n  Board or                             2,000  \n  Committee/Subcommi\u2026                         \n  Meeting Fee2                                \n                                              \n                                              \n         The Board\u0092s independent Chairman      \n         receives a $250,000 annual           \n  (1)    retainer, in lieu of any Committee   \n         Chair fee the independent Chairman   \n         might otherwise receive.             \n                                              \n                                              \n         Includes standing                    \n         Committee/subcommittee meetings as   \n         well as special purpose committee    \n  (2)    meetings not held concurrently with  \n         or immediately prior to or           \n         following a Company Board or         \n         Committee/subcommittee meeting.      \n                                              \nDirectors of Wells Fargo Bank, National\nAssociation, a wholly owned subsidiary of our\nCompany (WFBNA), received an additional\n$10,000 annual cash retainer. The chair of\nthe WFBNA Board\u0092s Regulatory Compliance\nOversight Committee, to which each of WFBNA\u0092s\nBoard and the Company\u0092s Board have delegated\noversight of compliance with various\nregulatory consent orders, also received a\nchair fee of $25,000. 2021 Equity\nCompensation For 2021, each non-\nemployeedirector elected to our Board at our\nCompany\u0092s annual meeting of shareholders\nreceived on that date an award of Company\ncommon stock having a value of $180,000. Any\nnon-employeedirector who joined our Board as\nof any other date received, as of such other\ndate, an award of Company common stock having\na value of $180,000 prorated to reflect the\nnumber of months (rounded up to the next\nwhole month) until the next annual meeting of\nshareholders. The dollar value of each stock\naward was converted to a number of shares of\nCompany common stock using the closing price\non the grant date, rounded up to the nearest\nwhole share. Deferral Program For 2021, non-\nemployee directors were able to defer all or\npart of their cash compensation and stock\nawards. Cash compensation could be deferred\ninto either an interest-bearing account or\ncommon stock units with dividends reinvested.\nThe interest rate paid in 2021 on interest-\nbearing accounts was 0.89%. Stock awards\ncould be deferred only into common stock\nunits with dividends reinvested. Deferred\namounts are paid either in a lump sum or\ninstallments, as elected by the director.\nStock Ownership Policy Our Board has adopted\na director stock ownership policy that each\nnon-employeedirector, within five years after\njoining our Board, must own shares of our\ncommon stock having a value equal to five\ntimes the annual cash retainer and maintain\nat least that ownership level while a member\nof our Board and for one year after service\nas a director ends. Each director who has\nbeen on our Board for five years or more\nexceeded this ownership level as of December\n31, 2021, and each director who has served\nless than five years is on track to meet this\nownership level.\n                               \n  42    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nCorporate Governance GNC Use of Compensation\nConsultant The GNC is authorized to retain and\nobtain advice of legal, accounting, or other\nadvisors at our expense without prior\npermission of management or our Board. The GNC\nretained Meridian Compensation Partners\n(Meridian), a nationally recognized\ncompensation consulting firm, to provide\nindependent advice on non-employeedirector\ncompensation matters for 2021. Meridian\ncompiles compensation data for the financial\nservices companies the GNC considers our Labor\nMarket Peer Group (which is the same peer\ngroup used to evaluate our Company\u0092s executive\ncompensation program) from time to time, and\nreviews with the GNC our Company\u0092s non-\nemployeedirector compensation program\ngenerally and in comparison to those of our\nLabor Market Peer Group. Meridian also advises\nthe GNC on the reasonableness of our non-\nemployeedirector compensation levels compared\nto our Labor Market Peer Group. Compensation\nChanges for 2022 Following an analysis by\nMeridian of our non-employee director\ncompensation program, including in comparison\nto the Labor Market Peer Group, and upon the\nrecommendation of the GNC, our Board has\napproved changes to our non-employee director\ncompensation program. The changes include\ndiscontinuing Board, Committee and\nsubcommittee meeting fees except for meetings\nin excess of twelve per year; increasing the\nvalue of the annual stock award to $240,000;\nincreasing most Committee Chair fees; and\nincreasing the annual cash retainer to\n$100,000, with each such change being\neffective April 1, 2022. Additionally,\neffective January 1, 2023, we will begin\npaying the independent Chairman\u0092s annual\nretainer entirely in Company common stock, and\nrequiring deferral of both that retainer and\nthe annual stock awards granted to each\ndirector until such director leaves the Board.\nThe changes are designed to result in equity\ncompensation constituting a majority of non-\nemployee director compensation. New Director\nCompensation Limit Subject to shareholder\napproval of Item 3 (Approve the Company\u0092s 2022\nLong-Term Incentive Plan), our equity\nincentive plan will now contain an upper limit\nof the total compensation that a non-\nemployeedirector may receive annually. Under\nthe proposed 2022 LTIP, the total annual\ncompensation paid to any non-employee\ndirector, inclusive of cash compensation and\namounts awarded under the 2022 LTIP, shall not\nexceed $750,000, except that in the case of\nthe Chairman of the Board or any Independent\nLead Director, such limit is instead\n$1,500,000. All planned changes to our\ndirector compensation program, as described\nabove, are within these limits.\n                              \n  2022 Proxy Statement    43  \n                              \nCorporate Governance\n\nDirector Compensation The table below\nprovides information on 2021 compensation for\nour non-employeedirectors.

The GNC\nannually reviews all ongoing Interested\nTransactions.\n                              \n  2022 Proxy Statement    47  \n                              \nOwnership of Our Common Stock\n                                    \n  Directors\u00a0and\u00a0Executive\u00a0Officers  \n                                    \nStock Ownership Requirements and Other\nPolicies Stock Ownership Requirements To\nreinforce the long-term perspective of stock-\nbased compensation and emphasize the\nrelationship between the interests of our\ndirectors and executive officers with your\ninterests as shareholders, we require our\nnon-employeedirectors and our executive\nofficers to own shares of our common stock.\nOur Board has adopted robust stock ownership\npolicies that apply to our directors and\nexecutive officers as summarized in the chart\nbelow.\n                                              \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICER                           \n  STOCK OWNERSHIP                             \n  POLICY                                      \n  REQUIREMENTS                                \n  While employed by                           \n  the Company and                             \n  for one year                                \n  following                                   \n  retirement, our                             \n  executive officers                          \n  must                                        \n  hold shares of                              \n  Wells Fargo common                          \n  stock equal to at     DIRECTOR STOCK        \n  least 75% of the      OWNERSHIP POLICY      \n  after-tax profit      REQUIREMENTS          \n  shares (assuming a    After five years on   \n  50% tax rate)         the Board, each       \n  acquired upon the     non-employee          \n  exercise of stock     director must own     \n  options or upon       stock having a value  \n  the distribution      equal to five times   \n  of other              their annual cash     \n  stock-based awards    retainer, and         \n  if the total value    maintain              \n  of Wells Fargo        at least that stock   \n  common stock the      ownership level       \n  executive owns is     while a member of     \n  less than three       the Board and for     \n  times cash salary     one year after        \n  (six times cash       service as a          \n  salary for the        director terminates.  \n  CEO) (the minimum                           \n  threshold amount),                          \n  and at least 50%                            \n  of such after-tax                           \n  profit shares if                            \n  the total value of                          \n  Wells Fargo common                          \n  stock the                                   \n  executive                                   \n  owns is greater                             \n  than the                                    \n  applicable minimum                          \n  threshold amount.                           \n                                              \nShares counted toward ownership include\nshares a non-employeedirector has deferred\npursuant to the Directors Stock Compensation\nand Deferral Plan (Directors Plan), shares\n(or share equivalents) an executive officer\nholds in the Company 401(k) Plan,\nSupplemental 401(k) Plan, Deferred\nCompensation Plan, Direct Purchase and\nDividend Reinvestment Plan, and shares owned\nby an executive officer\u0092s spouse.

This enhances our ability to hold\nemployees accountable when expectations are\nnot met and to reward employees when\nexpectations are met or exceeded. Performance\nmanagement is a key facet of how we align our\nculture and Company expectations for our\nemployees. Our Performance Management Policy\nestablishes the framework and standards\nintended to reinforce personal accountability\nand risk management. Our compensation program\nis linked to performance management and\npromotes prudent risk management and\nreinforces our Company expectations. The\nCompany\u0092s compensation principles are:\n                               \n  56    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nHuman Capital Management How We Oversee\nPerformance and Compensation Board of\nDirectors and Human Resources Committee The\nBoard plays an important role in overseeing\nthe Company\u0092s performance management and\nincentive compensation programs, through its\nHRC. The HRC\u0092s expansive responsibilities\nallow it to focus on the alignment of the\nCompany\u0092s culture and employee conduct with\nour performance management and incentive\ncompensation programs. Since 2019, the HRC has\noverseen substantial changes to our\nperformance management and incentive\ncompensation programs, including enhancements\nto strengthen the consideration of risk in\nperformance with the addition of risk\naccountability as a core component of employee\nperformance evaluations, roll-out of new\nCompany expectations for employees and\nmanagers to guide how we lead ourselves,\ncollaborate with our colleagues, and make\ndecisions, approval of an enhanced Clawback\nand Forfeiture Policy that expanded the\nindividuals and compensation subject to\nforfeiture or recovery, and the implementation\nof a framework and standards for including\nmisconduct as an input to performance\nevaluations and incentive decisions. Under the\noversight of the HRC, management has\nestablished a framework that governs\nperformance management and incentive\ncompensation. Incentive Compensation and\nPerformance Management Committee The Incentive\nCompensation and Performance Management\nCommittee (IPC) is a governance committee\nreporting to the HRC, its responsibilities\ninclude oversight of the Company\u0092s risk\nmanagement efforts related to incentive\ncompensation and performance management\npractices, in accordance with the Company\u0092s\nRisk Management Framework. Group Incentive\nCompensation and Performance Management\nSteering Committees The Company has fourteen\nGroup Incentive Compensation and Performance\nManagement Steering Committees (Group IPCs).\nThe Group IPCs are steering committees\nestablished by the IPC and are aligned with\neach of the Company\u0092s lines of business and\nenterprise functions. Group IPCs are co-\nchairedby the business Operating Committee\nmember and Compensation Leader. The Group IPCs\noversee, govern, and make informed\nrecommendations or decisions, as applicable,\nabout business-aligned efforts related to\nincentive compensation and performance\nmanagement, with a critical focus on material\nrisk failures, for applicable employees and\npractices within their authority and in\naccordance with our Risk Management Framework.\nRemuneration Committees The Europe, Middle\nEast, and Africa (EMEA) entity boards and\nwhere applicable, remuneration committees,\nprovide local remuneration governance focused\non effectively applying the applicable\nremuneration policy and practices, as well as\napproving the identified staff. Performance\nManagement Each year, managers and employees\nare expected to work together to set\nperformance goals in support of enterprise\nstrategy, business goals and their roles and\nresponsibilities through, among other things,\nthe lens of strong risk management practices.\nThese defined performance goals are meant to\nguide employees in doing their work. Managers\nand employees then participate in mid-yearand\nyear-endperformance evaluations to discuss and\ndocument key accomplishments against goals,\nincluding risk accountability. Each employee\nis to be provided with both an overall\nperformance rating and a risk overlay rating.\nKey Performance Elements That Inform\nCompensation Outcomes\n                              \n  2022 Proxy Statement    57  \n                              \nHuman Capital Management\n                                              \n  Additional                                  \n  Oversight \u00a0 Performance goals for           \n  employees and management whose roles        \n  involve promotional or                      \n  sales activity are designed to discourage   \n  excessive or inappropriate risk-taking,     \n  and are subject to additional oversight to  \n  validate all objectives for sales activity  \n  populations meet defined requirements.      \n  These performance goals are intended to     \n  drive the right behaviors and serve our     \n  customers\u0092 needs through the following       \n  requirements:                               \n                                              \nConsideration of Risk in Performance\nEvaluations and Compensation Decisions for\nPerformance Year 2021\n                                              \n                         For every            \n                         employee, risk       \n                         accountability is    \n                         assessed as part of  \n                         his or her           \n                         performance goals,   \n                         through a Risk       \n                         Overlay rating.

The ICRM program\naccounts for Wells Fargo\u0092s Risk Management\nFramework, including the Company\u0092s financial\nand non-financialrisks, and regulatory\nrequirements. As outlined in our ICRM policy\nand applicable standards, our governance\nframework identifies employees whose role\ncould create a material risk, requires their\nincentive compensation to be appropriately\nbalanced to discourage unnecessary or\ninappropriate risk-taking, and provides for\nmonitoring and validation.

To effectively and thoroughly\ngovern incentive compensation arrangements in\na consistent manner, the Company has incentive\ncompensation design standards applicable\nacross these incentive compensation\narrangements. Risk management is considered in\nthe design of our incentive compensation\narrangements. Human Resources coordinates the\nannual review process in partnership with\nIndependent Risk Management and other\ncentralized control functions, and designs and\nmanages the ICRM program, including the ICRM\nPolicy. During the review, we assess risk\nbalancing, compliance with laws and\nregulations, and the arrangements\u0092 potential\nto encourage employees to take unnecessary or\ninappropriate risks.

Our HRC Chair, Corporate Secretary\nand leaders from our Human Resources,\nInvestor Relations, and ESG teams\nparticipated in meetings on behalf of the\nBoard and the Company, and our HRC met eight\ntimes to discuss enhancements to the program\nand provided regular reports to the full\nBoard. The extent of our shareholder\nengagement is shown below.\n                                              \n                                Total\u00a0        \n  Total          Total          Engaged\u00a0with  \n  Contacted      Engaged        HRC\u00a0Chair\u00a0    \n                                Participati\u2026  \n  47%            44%            30%           \n  of total       of total       of total      \n  outstanding    outstanding    outstanding   \n  shares         shares         shares        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Refer to Additional Notes, Note 6, on  \n  1    page 138 for a further discussion of   \n       Efficiency Ratio.                      \n                                              \n                              \n  2022 Proxy Statement    65  \n                              \nExecutive Compensation\n\nCommon themes we heard during engagement\nincluded preferences that we provide more\ninformation about how our HRC determined the\nincentive compensation of our NEOs, including\nabout the process for making these\ndeterminations, that our CEO receive a higher\nproportion of his long-term equity\ncompensation in the form of performance-based\nequity, and that our performance-based equity\ninclude a relative measure of performance. In\nconsultation with a new independent\ncompensation consultant retained by the HRC\nin 2021, the HRC closely studied and\ndiscussed shareholder feedback, examined our\nexisting executive compensation program,\nevaluated various potential enhancements to\nour program, and, ultimately, approved\nenhancements to our disclosure and several\nstructural changes to our executive\ncompensation program. Collectively, these\nchanges continue to underscore the importance\nof pay-for-performance, align executive\ncompensation with shareholder value creation,\nand provide enhanced disclosure of the HRC\u0092s\ndecision-making for both the performance\nassessment and variable incentive\ncompensation determination.

As a\nresult of these adjustments, the Company\u0092s\nReturn on Realized Common Equity (RORCE)\n1ranking improved one spot to nine out of 11\ncompanies. For Performance Shares granted in\n2020 and 2021, the HRC will certify\nperformance following completion of the\nthree-year performance periods ending\nDecember 31, 2022, and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. Peer Groups and Benchmarking\nThe HRC, with assistance from its independent\ncompensation consultant, periodically reviews\nthe composition of our peer groups to ensure\nthe groups continue to serve as an\nappropriate market reference for executive\ncompensation purposes. For 2021, the HRC\ncontinued to utilize the existing peer\ngroups, as they continue to appropriately\nreflect our current scope, scale, and\nbusiness mix, including the peers with whom\nwe compete for talent. The HRC reviews market\ndata from our peer groups as one factor in\nevaluating and determining executive\ncompensation. The HRC also considers peer\ngroup data in structuring the design of the\nexecutive compensation program. Peer Group\nfor 2021 Compensation Decisions To make\nmarket informed decisions on compensation,\nthe HRC reviews NEOs\u0092 pay levels and the\nCompany\u0092s pay practices within the context of\nour Labor Market Peer Group. Specifically,\nthe HRC reviewed compensation data for the\nLabor Market Peer Group in considering the\n2021 compensation decisions for our NEOs,\nincluding base salary and variable incentive\ncompensation. In referencing market data, the\nHRC does not target a specific percentile,\nbut instead uses data as a reference point.\nThe peer group consists of ten companies with\nwhich we most directly compete for executive\ntalent based on requisite expertise,\nknowledge, and experience. The Labor Market\nPeer Group is shown below.\n                                              \n                 American                     \n                 Express        JPMorgan      \n                 Company        Chase\u00a0& Co.   \n                 Bank of        Morgan        \n                 America        Stanley The   \n                 Corporation    PNC           \n  Labor          The Bank of    Financial     \n  Market         New York       Services      \n  Peer Group     Mellon         Group, Inc.   \n                 Corporation    State Street  \n                 Citigroup,     Corporation   \n                 Inc.

The HRC uses the Financial\nPerformance Peer Group to assess our relative\nperformance for purposes of measuring Company\nfinancial performance. The HRC also uses the\nFinancial Performance Peer Group to measure\nTSR to apply the TSR performance condition\nfor Performance Shares. The peer group is\nalso used for purposes of determining\nrelative performance for Performance Shares.\nThe GSIBs selected by the HRC best reflect\nthose companies that it believes compete with\nus for capital and customers, and are most\nsimilar in terms of scope, scale, and\nbusiness mix.

For DE&I, the HRC\nevaluates the CEO\u0092s progress on key Company-\nwide DE&I priorities, and for other NEOs, the\nHRC uses progress on diverse representation\nand inclusion across specific diversity\ndimensions of NEO leadership teams with\npotential adjustments to variable incentive\ncompensation based on a holistic assessment\nof progress in one or more diversity\ndimensions. The performance assessment and\nvariable incentive determination process\naligns incentive compensation determinations\nwith performance against long-term value\ndrivers of the Company and prudent risk\noversight, and provides the HRC with the\nability to reduce an individual NEO\u0092s\nperformance achievement level to zero for\nfailures in risk management, including\nmisconduct. The performance assessment and\nvariable incentive determination process is\ndescribed below. Incentive Compensation\nTargets The HRC establishes incentive\ncompensation targets for our NEOs each year.\nThe compensation targets are based on the\nCompany\u0092s strategic planning, annual\nbudgeting and risk and control environment\nand are designed to achieve our strategic\npriorities. Compensation targets are also\nbased on each NEO\u0092s role and\nresponsibilities, as well as competitive and\nmarket factors and internal equity. Company\nGoals The HRC selects financial and non-\nfinancial goals that closely align with the\nCompany\u0092s key value drivers, strategic plan,\nand risk and control framework. For 2021, the\nHRC selected many of the same goals that were\nincluded in the 2020 executive compensation\nprogram, as well as additional goals that the\nHRC believed were important to increase\nalignment with the Company\u0092s strategic focus\nareas. For 2021, the Company goals were:\n                               \n  72    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nExecutive Compensation Individual Goals The\nHRC uses a disciplined approach in\nestablishing goals that incentivize NEOs to\ndeliver on the Company\u0092s strategic priorities.\nGoals are established at the beginning of each\nyear. Individual NEO goals are tailored to\neach NEO\u0092s area of responsibility and\nreinforced throughout the year. At the end of\nthe year, results from the performance\nassessment against these goals are tied\ndirectly to the NEO\u0092s variable incentive\ncompensation. For 2021, the individual NEO\ngoals related to: Assess Performance and\nDetermine Variable Incentive Compensation The\nHRC regularly monitors and reviews performance\nthroughout the year. At the end of the year,\nthe HRC assesses Company and individual NEO\nperformance against goals and assigns\nachievement levels for overall Company and\nindividual NEO performance, including line-of-\nbusiness performance for NEOs who head one of\nour lines of business. The HRC assesses\nperformance holistically and without a\npredetermined or set weighting as to any\nparticular goals. The Company and individual\nNEO achievement levels, including line-of-\nbusiness performance, as applicable, are used\nto determine total performance achievement,\nwhich then is applied to the variable\nincentive target to determine total variable\nincentive compensation, consisting of annual\ncash bonus and long-term equity (Performance\nShares and RSRs). The total variable incentive\ncompensation process is illustrated below:\n                              \n  2022 Proxy Statement    73  \n                              \nExecutive Compensation\n                                          \n  3    Named\u00a0Executive\u00a02021\u00a0Compensation  \n                                          \n2021 Company Performance Company performance\nis a key input into the determination of\nNEOs\u0092 2021 variable incentive compensation.\nThe HRC evaluated 2021 Company performance\ntaking into account financial and non-\nfinancial performance outcomes, including\nprogress made against key risk objectives and\nDE&I, and then assigned an overall Company\nperformance achievement level, as discussed\nin more detail below.

vested and/or\npaid, so long as such payment(s) have taken\nplace within five years from when the HRC\napproves a clawback. Other Executive Benefits\nand Policies Deferred Compensation and Other\nBenefits NEOs are eligible for the same\nbenefits generally available to all\nemployees, including health, disability, and\nother benefits, and our Company 401(k) plan.\nOur Company matched up to 6% of eligible\n401(k) plan participants\u0092 certified\ncompensation during 2021. NEOs and certain\nother highly compensated team members can\nparticipate in our Deferred Compensation\nPlan. Subject to IRS limitations, this Plan\nalso provides for supplemental Company\nmatching contributions for any compensation\ndeferred into the Plan by participants,\nincluding NEOs, that otherwise would have\nbeen eligible for a matching contribution\nunder our Company\u0092s 401(k) Plan. The HRC\nbelieves these programs are similar to and\ncompetitive with those offered by our Labor\nMarket Peer Group. We provide information\nabout the benefits under these plans in the\n2021 Non-QualifiedDeferred Compensation table\nand related narrative. Perquisites and Other\nCompensation The HRC has intentionally\nlimited perquisites to our NEOs. We may pay\nfor relocation-related services for our\nexecutives, including temporary housing,\nmoving expenses, and home purchase closing\nexpenses. For security purposes, we provide a\ncar and driver to our CEO, Mr. Scharf,\nprimarily for business travel and commuting\nand, from time to time, personal use. Mr.\nScharf has agreed to reimburse us for the\nincremental cost of personal travel. Mr.\nScharf is permitted to use our corporate\naircraft for personal travel with the\nunderstanding that he will reimburse us for\nthe incremental cost. The HRC may approve\nsecurity measures, including residential\nsecurity systems and services, if determined\nto be in the business interests of our\nCompany for the safety and security of our\nexecutives and other employees.\n                               \n  84    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nExecutive Compensation New Hire Sign-OnBonuses\nand Buy-OutEquity Awards As part of our\nefforts to build out the senior management\nteam and to attract and retain top executive\ntalent, we have provided in certain instances\nsign-onbonuses and buy-outequity awards for\nnew hires. New hire sign-onbonuses and buy-\noutequity awards are an effective means of\nmaking up for compensation opportunities\nexecutives forfeit when they leave a former\nemployer to join the Company. We typically\nrequire NEOs to return all or a portion of\ntheir sign-onbonus if, within a certain period\nof time after joining us, they voluntarily\nleave the Company or are involuntarily\nterminated by the Company for cause. New hire\nequity awards are used to incentivize\nexecutives to join without unnecessarily\nincreasing annual compensation levels. These\nawards are subject to a time-based vesting\nperiod and such other terms and conditions as\nthe HRC determines.\n                              \n  2022 Proxy Statement    85  \n                              \nExecutive Compensation\n                                          \n  5    Compensation\u00a0Governance\u00a0Oversight  \n                                          \nRole of the HRC and CEO The HRC believes that\nstrong governance and oversight of our\nexecutive compensation program is essential\nto the Company\u0092s long-term success. To\nachieve this strong oversight, the HRC is\ncomprised of independent directors with\nqualifications and experience related to\nhuman capital risk and human capital\nmanagement who make market-informed decisions\nbased on discussions throughout the year (in\nboth regularly scheduled meetings and special\nmeetings, as appropriate) and who are\ninformed by an independent compensation\nconsultant. The HRC oversees the Company\u0092s\nperformance management and incentive\ncompensation programs and approves all\ncompensation decisions relating to the\nCompany\u0092s executive officers, including NEOs.\nThe HRC reviews and approves the annual\nfinancial and non-financialperformance goals\nset by the CEO. These goals are aligned with\nthe Company\u0092s strategic plan, risk appetite,\nand risk and control framework. The goals\nthen flow through to each NEO, who\nestablishes aligned goals that are reviewed\nby the HRC. The HRC also evaluates Company\nresults after the end of the performance\nyear, considering financial outcomes,\nconsistency with the strategic plan and our\nrisk appetite, prior year performance, and\nexecution of key initiatives and other\nqualitative factors. The CEO and HRC assess\nCompany performance as a starting point for\ndetermining compensation for NEOs.

During the year, Meridian\ncompiled compensation data for the Labor\nMarket Peer Group and reviewed with the HRC\nour executive compensation programs generally\nand compared to those of our Labor Market\nPeer Group. Meridian also advised the HRC on\nthe reasonableness of our compensation levels\ncompared to our Labor Market Peer Group and\nthe appropriateness of our executive\ncompensation program structure in supporting\nour business objectives and in consideration\nof shareholder feedback.\n                               \n  86    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nExecutive Compensation\n\nOn an annual basis, the HRC reviews the\nservices performed by, and the fees paid to\nMeridian. Upon conducting this review, the\nHRC determined that Meridian does no other\nwork for our Company or management other than\nto provide consulting services to the GNC,\nHRC, and Board that are directly related to\nemployee and non-employeedirector\ncompensation. To help maintain the\nindependence of any consultant retained by\nthe HRC, the HRC is required under its\ncharter to pre-approveall services performed\nfor our Company by Meridian, other than the\nservices performed for the GNC for non-\nemployeedirector compensation. All services\nprovided to the HRC and our Board in 2021,\nother than those performed for the GNC for\nnon-employeedirector compensation, were pre-\napprovedby the HRC. The HRC assessed\nMeridian\u0092s independence in light of NYSE\nlisting standards and SEC rules and concluded\nthat no conflict of interest or independence\nconcerns exist. Conclusion The HRC values the\nfeedback received from our shareholders, and\nbelieves the changes made to our executive\ncompensation program are aligned with\nshareholder input. The HRC also believes that\nthe 2021 compensation decisions for our NEOs\nwere reasonable and appropriate and\nconsistent with our compensation principles.\n                                 \n  Compensation\u00a0Committee\u00a0Report  \n                                 \nIn its capacity as the compensation committee\nof our Board, the HRC has reviewed and\ndiscussed with management the Compensation\nDiscussion and Analysis that immediately\nprecedes this report. Based on this review\nand these discussions, the HRC has\nrecommended to our Board that the\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis be\nincluded in this proxy statement and\nincorporated by reference in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 for filing with the SEC.\nMembers of the Human Resources Committee\nRonald L.

On July 1,\n2009, the Cash Balance Plan was frozen.

Mr. Weiss\u0092s\nbenefits will be paid to him from the Cash\nBalance Plan upon his retirement. Under the\nterms by which the Wachovia Pension Plan was\nmerged into the Cash Balance Plan, Mr.\nWeiss\u0092s account receives interest credits\nbased on the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury\nConstant Maturities. \u0093Normal retirement age\u0094\nunder the Cash Balance Plan is defined as age\n65.

The Deferred Compensation Plan also\nprovides for supplemental Company matching\ncontributions related to any compensation\ndeferred by a plan participant, including\nnamed executives, that would have been\neligible (up to certain IRS limits) but for\nthis deferral, for a matching contribution\nunder the 401(k) Plan. As of December 31,\n2021, none of our named executives were\nparticipating in the Deferred Compensation\nPlan. Wachovia Elective Deferral Plan and\nWachovia Savings Restoration Plan As a former\nWachovia executive, Mr. Weiss participated in\nthe Wachovia Elective Deferral Plan and the\nWachovia Savings Restoration Plan.\nParticipation in these plans was frozen and\ncontributions ceased for the Wachovia\nElective Deferral Plan, effective December\n31, 2008, and for the Wachovia Savings\nRestoration Plan, effective December 31,\n2007. The Wachovia Elective Deferral Plan is\na frozen, unfunded, nonqualified deferred\ncompensation plan that allowed certain highly\ncompensated employees to defer base salary\nand/or incentive payments on a pre-taxbasis\nuntil a future date (generally retirement,\ndeath, or separation from service). The terms\nof the plan required participants to\nirrevocably elect the form of payment (either\nin installments or in a lump sum), and\npermitted early withdrawal of account\nbalances in the case of an unforseeable\nemergency resulting in severe financial\nhardship. In addition, participant salary\ndeferral amounts were subject to a company\nmatch in certain circumstances. The Wachovia\nSavings Restoration Plan is a frozen,\nunfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation\nplan that previously provided for pre-\ntaxdeferral contributions to restore Wells\nFargo 401(k) plan contributions beyond the\nIRS qualified plan contribution limitations.\nEmployees with an annual base salary greater\nthan Internal Revenue Code annual covered\ncompensation limits were eligible to\nparticipate and could elect to contribute up\nto 30% of base salary. Wachovia matched\nparticipants\u0092 contributions on a dollar-for-\ndollarbasis up to 6% of base salary.\nParticipants elected, at the time they joined\nthe plan, the timing of the payment of their\naccount balances (on or after five years of\nparticipation, or upon separation or\nretirement), as well as the form and term of\npayment of their accounts (lump sum or ten\nannual installments), and may petition for,\nand receive an early distribution of, their\naccount balances in the event of an\nunforseeable emergency causing severe\nfinancial hardship. Participants are entitled\nto invest all or a portion of their deferral\naccounts in one or more investment options\navailable under the plans, which generally\nmirror those offered in the Wells Fargo\n401(k) Plan, and to receive the earnings on\nthe deferred amounts based on those\ninvestment elections upon distribution of the\ndeferral accounts, subject to income tax\nwithholding.\n                              \n  2022 Proxy Statement    95  \n                              \nExecutive Compensation\n\nPotential Post-EmploymentPayments We do not\nhave employment or other severance agreements\nwith our named executives. The table below\nshows estimated post-employment payments for\nour named executives serving as of December\n31, 2021, assuming they had terminated\nemployment on that day. To estimate the\npayment amounts for each named executive, we\nused the closing price of our common stock on\nDecember 31, 2021 of $47.98.

Under   \n         the LTICP, retirement generally      \n         occurs when a named executive has    \n         reached the earliest of (a)\u00a0age 55   \n         with 10 completed years of service,  \n         (b) 80 points (with one point        \n         credited                             \n  (4)    for each completed age year and one  \n         point credited for each completed    \n         year of service); or (c)\u00a0age 65.

For Mr.\u00a0Scharf,          \n         retirement means the termination of  \n         employment (i)\u00a0after reaching age    \n         55 with five completed years of      \n         service or (ii)\u00a0based on such more   \n         favorable treatment as may apply     \n         under the practices of the Company   \n         in effect from time to time.

Under\nthe Deferred Compensation Plan, eligible\nemployees may defer receipt of salary,\nbonuses, and certain other compensation\nsubject to the terms of the plan. Deferral\nelections are irrevocable once made except for\nlimited re-deferralopportunities. We treat\namounts deferred by a participant as if\ninvested in the earnings options selected by\nthe participant, and determine the deferred\ncompensation benefit payable to the\nparticipant based on the performance of those\nearnings options. The plan offers a number of\nearnings options, including one based on our\ncommon stock with dividends reinvested. We\ngenerally distribute amounts allocated to the\ncommon stock option in shares of common stock.\nParticipants have no direct interest in any of\nthe earnings options and are general unsecured\ncreditors of the Company with respect to their\ndeferred compensation benefits under the plan.\nNon-QualifiedDeferred Compensation Plan for\nIndependent Contractors. Under the Non-\nQualifiedDeferred Compensation Plan for\nIndependent Contractors participants who\nperformed qualifying investment or other\nfinancial services for participating\naffiliates as independent contractors were\nable to defer all or part of their eligible\ncompensation payable to them by the affiliate\nsubject to the terms of the plan. Deferral\nelections were irrevocable once made. Amounts\ndeferred by a participant were treated as if\ninvested in the earnings options selected by\nthe participant, which determine the deferred\ncompensation benefit payable to the\nparticipant. The plan offered a number of\nearnings options, including one based on our\ncommon stock with dividends reinvested. We\ngenerally distribute amounts allocated to the\ncommon stock option in shares of common stock.\nNo future deferrals may be made under this\nplan and participants may no longer reallocate\ntheir existing account balances under the plan\namong different investment options. Shares\nremaining available for issuance under the\nplan consist of shares issuable as a result of\namounts credited to participant accounts\ndenominated in our common stock to reflect\ncash dividends paid on the common stock. The\nplan is sponsored by a wholly owned\nsubsidiary, WF Deferred Compensation Holdings,\nInc. We have guaranteed its obligations under\nthe plan. Participants have no direct interest\nin any of the earnings options and are general\nunsecured creditors of the plan sponsor and\nthe Company with respect to their deferred\ncompensation benefits under the plan. Norwest\nCorporation Directors\u0092 Formula Stock Award\nPlan. Under the Norwest Corporation Directors\u0092\nFormula Stock Award Plan we awarded shares of\ncommon stock to non-employee directors. The\nplan allowed participants to defer receipt of\nall or a portion of their awards, with\ndividends reinvested, until a future year or\nyears as selected by the participants subject\nto the terms of the plan. Participants can\nelect one time to defer commencement of\ndistribution of their deferral accounts if the\nelection is made sufficiently in advance of\nthe original distribution commencement date\nand the new distribution commencement date is\nsufficiently beyond the original distribution\ncommencement date. Participants have no direct\ninterest in the shares deferred under the plan\nand are general unsecured creditors of the\nCompany with respect to payment of their\ndeferred stock awards under the plan. No\nfuture stock awards or deferrals may be made\nunder this plan.\n                              \n  2022 Proxy Statement    99  \n                              \nExecutive Compensation\n                                              \n  Item\u00a03\u00a0\u0096\u00a0Approve\u00a0the\u00a0Company\u0092s\u00a02022\u00a0          \n  Long-Term                                   \n  Incentive\u00a0Plan                              \n                                              \nIntroduction We are seeking approval of the\nWells Fargo & Company 2022 Long-Term\nIncentive Plan (the \u00932022 LTIP\u0094 or \u0093Plan\u0094),\nwhich, upon the recommendation of the HRC,\nwas approved by the Board on February 28,\n2022. The following is a summary of the 2022\nLTIP, which is subject to the full plan\ndocument set forth in Appendix A. The 2022\nLTIP will not take effect unless our\nshareholders approve it at the 2022 Annual\nMeeting. If our shareholders approve the 2022\nLTIP, shares that remain available for grant\nfor full-value awards under the Company\u0092s\nLong-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the\n\u0093LTICP\u0094), less the full-value awards granted\nto non-employee directors under the LTICP on\nthe date of the 2022 Annual Meeting, will\nbecome available for grant under the 2022\nLTIP, and no future grants will be made under\nthe LTICP after the date of the 2022 Annual\nMeeting. As of February 7, 2022, 104,879,368\nshares remained available under the LTICP,\n52,439,684 of which remained available for\nfull-value awards. Why Shareholders Should\nApprove the 2022 LTIP\n                                              \n  PRUDENT        SHAREHOLDER\u2026    SHAREHOLDE\u2026  \n  SHARE          PLAN            PLAN         \n  REQUEST        FEATURES        PRACTICES    \n                                              \nPrudent Share Request We are asking\nshareholders for an additional 80 million\nshares in connection with approving the 2022\nLTIP. The Board believes that this request\nwill provide an adequate and appropriate pool\nof equity awards. Based on our current grant\npractices and potential Company growth, we\nestimate that the Plan\u0092s share reserve will\nenable the Company to grant additional equity\nawards for approximately three to four years.\nThe actual duration could be influenced by a\nnumber of factors, including Company growth,\nstock price, market pay practices, regulatory\nrequirements, and our continued use of\nperformance-based awards. Assuming our\nshareholders approve the 2022 LTIP, our\nestimated total potential dilution will be\napproximately 5.3%. For this purpose,\n\u0093estimated total potential dilution\u0094 is\ndefined as (i) the number of shares subject\nto outstanding full-value awards, plus (ii)\nshares available for future full-value\nawards, plus (iii) 80 million shares\nauthorized in connection with the 2022 LTIP,\ndivided by (iv) the total sum of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding, each as of February\n7, 2022. If shareholders approve the 2022\nLTIP, the maximum number of shares that may\nbe issued under the 2022 LTIP following the\n2022 Annual Meeting, assuming no\ncancellation, forfeiture or cash settlement\nof awards outstanding under the LTICP, will\nbe 132,439,684 shares, minus twice the number\nof shares that are awarded to non-employee\ndirectors under the LTICP on the date of the\n2022 Annual Meeting, since full-value shares\ncount 2:1 towards the LTICP pool.

Clawback and Forfeiture Policy The\nCompany has a robust Clawback and Forfeiture\nPolicy which serves to discourage employees\n(including our named executives) from taking\nunnecessary or inappropriate risks that would\nadversely impact our Company or harm our\ncustomers.

Plan Term The 2022 LTIP will become\neffective on the date following its approval\nby the Company\u0092s shareholders. Awards may be\ngranted pursuant to the Plan until the tenth\nanniversary of the Plan\u0092s effective date, and\nawards granted before that time may extend\nbeyond that date in accordance with their\nterms. Shares Authorized If shareholders\napprove the 2022 LTIP, a total of 132,439,684\nshares will be issuable after its approval,\nminus twice the number of shares that are\nawarded to non-employeedirectors under the\nLTICP on the date of the 2022 Annual Meeting.\nThe number of shares available for issuance\nunder the 2022 LTIP is not reduced by shares\nwith respect to awards that have been\ncanceled, expired, forfeited or settled in\ncash, substitute awards granted in connection\nwith a transaction, or, except with respect\nto stock options and SARs, shares withheld or\ntendered to satisfy tax withholding. If\nshareholders do not approve the 2022 LTIP,\nthe LTICP will remain in effect and awards\nwill continue to be issued thereunder.\nCommittee The 2022 LTIP will be administered\nby the HRC with respect to awards to\nemployees and by the GNC with respect to non-\nemployeedirectors, or by such other committee\nof one or more individuals appointed by the\nHRC or the Board from time to time (the\n\u0093Committee\u0094). Eligibility Employees,\ndirectors, and certain former employees (with\nrespect to certain compensation earned while\nemployed) selected by the Committee will be\neligible to become participants in the 2022\nLTIP. As of December 31, 2021, we had 10 non-\nemployee directors and approximately 250,000\nemployees. Director Awards The Committee\ndetermines all awards to non-employee\ndirectors and such awards are not subject to\nmanagement\u0092s discretion. From time to time,\nthe Committee will set the amount and the\ntype of award that will be granted to non-\nemployee directors on a periodic and\nnondiscriminatory basis. The Committee may\ngrant additional awards to non-employee\ndirectors, also on a periodic and\nnondiscriminatory basis, based on one or more\nof the following criteria: (i) service as the\nChair of a Board committee; (ii) service as\nthe Chairman of the Board or Lead Director;\n(iii) the number and/or type of Board\ncommittees on which a director serves; or\n(iv) one\u0092s initial selection or appointment\nto the Board. The Plan includes an annual\nlimit for each non-employeedirector\u0092s total\ncompensation. Under the 2022 LTIP, the total\nannual compensation paid to any non-\nemployeedirector, inclusive of cash\ncompensation and amounts awarded under the\n2022 LTIP, shall not exceed $750,000, except\nthat in the case of the Chairman of the Board\nor any Independent Lead Director, such limit\nis instead $1,500,000. Administration Subject\nto the provisions of the 2022 LTIP, the\nCommittee has the power to take all actions\nwith respect to the administration of the\n2022 LTIP, including, without limitation:\n                                              \n      Determine which eligible individuals,   \n      if any, awards shall be granted to,     \n      and the timing of any such awards;      \n                                              \n                                              \n      Grant awards to eligible individuals    \n      and determine the terms and conditions  \n      of such awards (which need not be       \n      identical),                             \n      including the number of shares subject  \n      thereto and the exercise or purchase    \n      price thereof, and the circumstances    \n      under which awards become exercisable,  \n      vested, forfeited or expired;           \n                                              \n                                              \n      Determine the extent to which any       \n      performance criteria or other           \n      conditions have been satisfied;         \n                                              \n                                              \n      Determine the appropriate adjustment,   \n      if any, as a result of any              \n      reorganization, reclassification,       \n      combination of shares,                  \n      stock split, reverse stock split,       \n      spin-off, stock dividend, or similar    \n      transactions or changes in the number   \n      or kind of outstanding shares or any    \n      stock or other securities into which    \n      such shares shall have been exchanged;  \n                                              \n                                \n  102    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nExecutive Compensation\n                                              \n      Subject to the 2022 LTIP\u0092s prohibitions  \n      on repricing, make adjustments in       \n      recognition of unusual or infrequently  \n      occurring events or changes in          \n      applicable laws (including non-U.S.     \n      laws), regulations, or accounting       \n      principles in order to prevent          \n      dilution or enlargement of benefits;    \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      Interpret and construe the 2022 LTIP    \n      and the terms and conditions of any     \n      award granted thereunder, and make      \n      exceptions to                           \n      any such provisions in good faith and   \n      for the benefit of the Company.         \n                                              \nAward Types Under the 2022 LTIP, the\nCommittee may grant awards in the following\nforms: stock options, stock appreciation\nrights (SARs), restricted stock, restricted\nshare rights (RSRs), performance shares,\nperformance units, and stock awards.\nRestricted Stock, Restricted Share Rights and\nStock Awards An award of restricted stock\nconsists of a specified number of shares of\nour common stock that are subject to\nrestrictions on transfer, conditions of\nforfeiture, and any other terms and\nconditions for periods determined by the\nCommittee. Prior to the termination of the\nrestrictions, a participant may vote the\nrestricted stock unless the Committee\ndetermines otherwise but may not sell or\notherwise transfer the shares. Dividends or\ndistributions paid with respect to unvested\nrestricted stock are subject to the same\nrestrictions and vesting schedule as the\nunderlying restricted stock. Dividends or\ndistributions may be accumulated but shall\nnot be paid with respect to unvested\nrestricted stock unless and until the vesting\nconditions are satisfied. The Committee may\nalso make stock awards of common stock\nwithout restrictions except that such awards\nto employees can be made only if in lieu of\nsalary, cash bonus, or other cash\ncompensation. An award of RSRs entitles a\nparticipant to receive a specified number of\nshares of our common stock upon the\nexpiration of a stated vesting period. It may\nalso include the right to dividend\nequivalents, to the extent provided by the\nCommittee, which shall not be paid with\nrespect to unvested RSRs unless and until the\nvesting conditions are satisfied although\nthey may be accumulated until such time.\nDividend equivalents with respect to unvested\nRSRs are subject to the same restrictions and\nvesting schedule as the RSRs to which the\ndividend equivalents relate. Unless the\nCommittee determines otherwise, after an RSR\nvests, the shares of common stock specified\nin the award will be issued to the\nparticipant, and upon such issuance, the\nparticipant may vote the shares of common\nstock. Until the vesting period applicable to\nan RSR award expires and the shares are\nissued, the participant also may not transfer\nor encumber any interest in the RSRs or in\nany related dividend equivalents. The\nCommittee has discretion to determine the\nterms of any award of restricted stock or\nRSRs, including the number of shares subject\nto the award (subject to the Plan\u0092s stated\nlimits), and the minimum period over which\nthe award may vest; provided that, subject to\nacceleration due to a change-in-control or\nthe participant\u0092s death, disability, or\nretirement, and subject to a limited pool of\nawards (up to 5% of the aggregate number of\nshares under the Plan) not subject to these\nrestrictions, referred to as \u0093shorter vesting\nawards,\u0094 (i) in no event may the grant,\nissuance, retention, vesting, and/or\nsettlement of shares under an award of RSRs\nthat is based on the level of achievement\nversus performance criteria be subject to a\nperformance period of less than one year; and\n(ii) no condition that is based solely upon\ncontinued employment or the passage of time\nmay provide for vesting or settlement in full\nof an award of RSRs over a term of less than\none year from the date of grant. These\nlimitations do not apply to either shorter\nvesting awards or awards of RSRs granted in\nlieu of salary, cash bonus, or other cash\ncompensation. Performance Shares and\nPerformance Units A grant of performance\nshares or performance units entitles a\nparticipant to receive cash, common stock\n(which may be in the form of restricted stock\nor RSRs), or a combination of both, based on\nthe degree of achievement of pre-\nestablishedperformance criteria over a\nperformance period of one to five years, as\ndetermined by the Committee. The Committee\nhas discretion to determine the terms of any\naward of performance shares or performance\nunits, including the maximum amount payable\n(subject to the Plan\u0092s stated limits), the\nperformance period, which must be a period of\nbetween one and five years, performance\ncriteria (which may be based on Company,\ngroup, unit, individual or other\nperformance), and level of achievement versus\nthese criteria, the timing of any payment,\nrestrictions on an award of performance\nshares or performance units prior to actual\npayment, forfeiture provisions, and any other\nterms and conditions consistent with the 2022\nLTIP. The Committee may establish performance\ncriteria and the level of achievement versus\nsuch criteria that determines the number of\nshares of common stock to be granted,\nretained, vested, issued, or issuable under\nor in settlement of or the amount payable\npursuant to an award, which criteria may be\nbased on Company, group, unit, individual or\nother performance. Notwithstanding\nsatisfaction of any performance criteria, the\nnumber of shares issued under or the amount\npaid under an award may be modified by the\nCommittee on the basis of such further\nconsiderations as the Committee in its sole\ndiscretion shall determine.\n                               \n  2022 Proxy Statement    103  \n                               \nExecutive Compensation Stock Options Stock\noptions may be granted under the 2022 LTIP as\nnon-qualifiedstock options or incentive stock\noptions. Stock options must be granted at a\nprice of at least fair market value of the\nstock on the day of grant, and incentive stock\noptions may not be granted to non-employee\ndirectors or former employees. Stock options\nmay be exercised during a period of time fixed\nby the Committee, except that (i) stock\noptions may not become fully or partially\nvested until at least one year after the date\nof grant (except upon a change-in-control or\ntermination of employment due to death,\ndisability, or retirement); and (ii) no stock\noption may be exercised more than ten years\nafter the date of grant. Otherwise, the\nCommittee has discretion to determine the\nnumber of shares subject to an option (subject\nto the Plan\u0092s stated limits), the vesting,\nexpiration, and forfeiture provisions for\noptions, the restrictions on transferability\nof an option, and any other terms and\nconditions otherwise consistent with the 2022\nLTIP. The exercise price of an option may be\npaid through various means acceptable to the\nCommittee, including in cash or, to the extent\nallowed by the Committee, by delivering\n(either physically or by attestation)\npreviously owned shares or by delivering to us\nthe proceeds of shares of our common stock\nissuable under an option or by other methods\napproved by the Committee. The 2022 LTIP\nprohibits repricing stock options without\nshareholder approval, including by exchanging\nstock options for other forms of awards under\nthe 2022 LTIP. Although the 2022 LTIP will\nretain the Company\u0092s ability to grant stock\noptions, we have not granted stock options\nsince 2013. Stock Appreciation Rights A SAR\nentitles a participant to receive a payment,\nin cash, common stock, or a combination of\nboth, equal to the difference between the fair\nmarket value of our common stock at the time\nof exercise and the exercise price of the\naward, which may not be lower than the fair\nmarket value of our common stock on the day of\ngrant. SARs may be exercised up to ten years\nafter the grant date, as determined by the\nCommittee. SARs are generally subject to the\nsame terms and limitations as options.\nAccordingly, the 2022 LTIP prohibits re-\npricingSARs without shareholder approval,\nincluding by exchanging SARs for other forms\nof awards under the 2022 LTIP. Transferability\nAwards are generally not transferable or\nassignable unless provided otherwise by the\nCommittee with respect to certain specified\nfamily-related transfers. Amendment and\nTermination After the 2022 LTIP becomes\neffective, the Board, the HRC, and the GNC\nwill each have the authority to modify,\nsuspend, or terminate the 2022 LTIP but not,\nwithout the prior approval of our\nshareholders, to make any change to the 2022\nLTIP that reduces the exercise price of or\nreprices outstanding stock options or SARs or\nthat otherwise requires shareholder approval\nby law or under the NYSE listing requirements.\nFuture Grants No grants have been made that\nare contingent on our shareholders\u0092 approval\nof the 2022 LTIP. Awards that may be granted\nin the future under the 2022 LTIP are within\nthe discretion of the Committee. Unless\notherwise determined by the Committee, each\nnon-employee director elected at our 2022\nAnnual Meeting of shareholders will receive,\nunder the LTICP, an award of our common stock\nhaving an award value of $240,000. All\nsubsequent awards will be granted under the\n2022 LTIP, provided that our shareholders\napprove the 2022 LTIP. A non-employeedirector\nwho joins the Board as of any other date will\nreceive, under the 2022 LTIP, as of such other\ndate, a stock award based on the full-year\naward value prorated to reflect the number of\nmonths (rounded up to the next whole month)\nremaining until the next annual meeting of\nshareholders. The number of shares of our\ncommon stock subject to a stock award will be\ndetermined by dividing the award value by the\nNYSE-only closing price of our common stock on\nthe date of grant (rounded up to the nearest\nwhole share), unless determined otherwise by\nthe Committee.\n                                \n  104    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nExecutive Compensation Certain Federal Income\nTax Consequences The following discussion of\nthe U.S. federal income tax consequences of\nthe 2022 LTIP is intended to be a general\nsummary of applicable U.S. federal law as\ncurrently in effect. Foreign, state, and local\ntax consequences may differ and may be amended\nor interpreted differently during the term of\nthe 2022 LTIP or under awards granted\nthereunder. Because the federal income tax\nrules governing awards and related payments\nare complex and subject to frequent change,\naward holders are advised to consult their\nindividual tax advisors. Restricted Stock,\nRestricted Share Rights, Performance Shares\nand Stock Awards Grantees of restricted stock,\nRSRs, performance shares, or stock awards (to\nthe extent such awards are unvested at the\ntime of grant) do not recognize income at the\ntime of the grant of such awards. However,\nwhen the award vests or is paid, as\napplicable, the grantee generally recognizes\nordinary income in an amount equal to the fair\nmarket value of the stock at such time, and we\nwill receive a corresponding deduction. A\nparticipant could, within 30 days after the\ndate of an award of restricted stock or stock\nawards (but not an award of RSRs), elect to\nreport compensation income for the tax year in\nwhich the award of restricted stock occurs. If\nthe participant makes such an election, the\namount of compensation income would be the\nvalue of the award at the time of grant. Any\nlater appreciation in the value of the award\nwould be treated as capital gain and realized\nonly upon the sale of the stock subject to the\naward. If, however, the award is forfeited\nafter the participant makes such an election,\nthe participant would not be allowed any\ndeduction for the amount earlier taken into\nincome. Upon the sale of shares subject to the\naward, a participant would realize capital\ngain (or loss) in the amount of the difference\nbetween the sale price and the value of the\nshares previously reported by the participant\nas compensation income. Performance Units and\nCash A participant will not have taxable\nincome upon the grant of a contingent right to\na performance unit or cash. Rather, taxation\nin connection with such an award will be\npostponed until it becomes payable. At that\ntime, the participant will recognize ordinary\nincome equal to the value of the amount then\npayable. Stock Options A participant who is\ngranted a stock option will not recognize\nincome and we will not be allowed a deduction\nat the time the option is granted. When a\nparticipant exercises a non-qualifiedstock\noption, the difference between the exercise\nprice and any higher market value of the stock\non the date of exercise (stock option gains)\nwill be ordinary income to the participant and\nwill generally be allowed as a deduction for\nfederal income tax purposes to Wells Fargo.\nThe capital gain holding period of the shares\nacquired will begin one day after the date the\nstock option is exercised. When a participant\ndisposes of shares acquired by the exercise of\nthe option, any amount received that is more\nthan the fair market value of the shares on\nthe exercise date will be treated as short-\nterm or long-term capital gain, depending upon\nthe holding period of the shares. If the\namount received is less than the market value\nof the shares on the exercise date, the loss\nwill be treated as short-term or long-term\ncapital loss, depending upon the holding\nperiod of the shares. When a participant\nexercises an incentive stock option while\nemployed by us or within the three-month\nperiod (one-yearperiod, in the case of\ndisability) after his or her employment ends,\nthe participant will not recognize any\nordinary income at that time. However, any\nexcess of the fair market value of the shares\nacquired by such exercise over the exercise\nprice will be an item of tax preference for\npurposes of any federal alternative minimum\ntax applicable to individuals. If the shares\nacquired upon exercise are disposed of more\nthan two years after the date of grant and one\nyear after the date of transfer of the shares\nto the participant (statutory holding\nperiods), any sale proceeds that exceed the\ntotal exercise price of these shares will be\nlong-term capital gain. Except in the event of\nthe optionee\u0092s death, if the shares are\ndisposed of prior to the expiration of the\nstatutory holding periods, referred to as a\n\u0093disqualifying disposition,\u0094 generally, the\namount by which the fair market value of the\nshares at the time of exercise exceeds the\ntotal exercise price will be ordinary income.\nIf a disqualifying disposition occurs, we will\ngenerally be entitled to a federal tax\ndeduction for a similar amount. Stock\nAppreciation Rights The grant of a SAR is\ngenerally not a taxable event for a\nparticipant. Upon exercise of the SAR, the\nparticipant will generally recognize ordinary\nincome equal to the cash or the fair market\nvalue of any shares received. We will\ngenerally be entitled to a tax deduction at\nthe same time for the same amount. The\nparticipant\u0092s subsequent sale of the shares\ngenerally will give rise to capital gain or\nloss equal to the difference between the sale\nprice and the ordinary income recognized when\nthe participant received the shares, and these\ncapital gains (or losses) will be treated as\nshort-term or long-term capital gains (or\nlosses), depending upon the holding period of\nthe shares.\n                               \n  2022 Proxy Statement    105  \n                               \nExecutive Compensation\n\nTax Withholding In connection with awards\ngranted under the 2022 LTIP, we may withhold\nfrom cash otherwise payable to a participant\nor require a participant to remit to us an\namount sufficient to satisfy federal, state,\nlocal and foreign withholding taxes. Tax\nwithholding obligations may be satisfied by\nwithholding shares to be received upon\nexercise of an option or SAR, the vesting of\nrestricted stock, performance shares, or\nstock awards, or the payment of an RSR or\nperformance unit, or by delivery to us of\npreviously owned shares of Company common\nstock. Certain Other Tax Provisions Section\n162(m) of the IRC limits the otherwise\nallowable deduction for compensation during a\ncalendar year paid to certain executive\nofficers and generally limits the otherwise\nallowable deduction to $1,000,000 for such\nexecutive officers. If an award granted under\nthe 2022 LTIP is determined to be\nnonqualified deferred compensation subject to\nSection 409A of the IRC, certain requirements\nmust be satisfied (including rules regarding\ndistribution timing, deferral elections, and\nacceleration of benefits). If an award does\nnot satisfy the requirements of Section 409A,\na participant may be subject to tax\nconsequences, including current taxation of\nall or a portion of the deferred compensation\nand earnings thereon (regardless of when the\ncompensation is paid), interest at the IRS\nunderpayment rate plus 1%, and an additional\n20% federal tax. The Company intends that all\nawards granted under the 2022 LTIP either be\nexempt from or comply with Section 409A of\nthe IRC.\n                                              \n  Item\u00a03                                      \n  \u0096 Approve the Company\u0092s 2022 Long-Term        \n  Incentive Plan                              \n  Our Board recommends that you vote FOR the  \n  approval of the 2022                        \n  Long-Term                                   \n  Incentive Plan.                             \n                                              \n                                \n  106    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nAudit Matters\n                                              \n  Item\u00a04\u00a0\u0096\u00a0Ratify\u00a0Appointment\u00a0of\u00a0Independent   \n  Registered\u00a0Public                           \n  Accounting\u00a0Firm\u00a0for\u00a02022                    \n                                              \nThe Audit Committee is responsible for the\nselection, compensation, retention, and\noversight of the independent registered\npublic accounting firm (independent auditor)\nappointed to audit our Company\u0092s financial\nstatements. The Audit Committee conducts a\ncomprehensive annual review process to select\nand retain the Company\u0092s independent auditor.\nIn connection with its annual review and as\ndiscussed in the Audit Committee Reportbelow,\nthe Audit Committee considered various\nfactors as part of its assessment of the\nqualifications, performance, and independence\nof the Company\u0092s independent auditor. The\nAudit Committee has appointed KPMG LLP as the\nCompany\u0092s independent auditor for the year\nending December 31, 2022. As a matter of good\ncorporate governance, the Board is requesting\nthat our shareholders ratify KPMG\u0092s\nappointment. KPMG served as our independent\nauditor for the year ended December 31, 2021,\nand KPMG or its predecessors have examined\nthe financial statements of our Company and\nits predecessors since 1931. If shareholders\ndo not ratify the appointment of KPMG, the\nAudit Committee will consider the\nshareholders\u0092 action in determining whether\nto appoint KPMG as our independent auditor\nfor 2023.

Changes in the  \n      scope of pre-approved services with     \n      estimated costs less than that amount   \n      may be approved by the Chief            \n      Accounting Officer and                  \n      Controller.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      The Audit Committee may pre-approve,    \n      for a particular calendar year,         \n      specific types                          \n      of audit, audit-related, advisory,      \n      consulting, or tax services that could  \n      arise with respect to that calendar     \n      year that were not already              \n      pre-approved as recurring services,     \n      subject to a fee cap for each           \n      category for that year.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      The Audit Committee may pre-approve,    \n      from time to time during the year,      \n      services                                \n      that have neither been pre-approved as  \n      recurring services nor pre-approved     \n      pursuant to the categorical             \n      pre-approval described                  \n      above.                                  \n                                              \nIn determining whether to pre-approvethe\nprovision by KPMG of a permissible non-\nauditservice, the Audit Committee considers\nthe facts and circumstances of the\nengagement, including other non-auditservices\nprovided by KPMG and the fees for those\nservices, and whether the provision of the\nnon-auditservice by KPMG could impair the\nindependence of KPMG with respect to us. The\nAudit Committee also considers whether KPMG\nis best positioned to provide the service\nbecause of its familiarity with our business,\nculture, accounting systems, risk profile,\nand other factors, and whether there are\nalternatives reasonably available to us and\nthe cost of those alternatives. The Audit\nCommittee requires competitive bidding for\nservices that are eligible for categorical\npre-approvaland services subject to\nindividual pre-approvalunless it is not\nwarranted because of the facts and\ncircumstances of the proposed engagement. The\nAudit Committee has delegated pre-\napprovalauthority to designated Audit\nCommittee members. Pre-approvalby a\ndesignated Audit Committee member is used for\ntime-sensitive engagements. Pre-\napprovaldecisions by a designated Audit\nCommittee member are reported to the full\nAudit Committee at a future meeting.\n                               \n  2022 Proxy Statement    111  \n                               \nShareholder Proposals Shareholders will vote\non the following shareholder proposals (Items\n5 through 11), if they are properly presented\nat our annual meeting and not previously\nwithdrawn or otherwise excluded.

This proposal shall\napply to the Executive Officers, whether or\nnot they were responsible for any associated\nmonetary penalty. These provisions should\noperate prospectively and be implemented in a\nway that does not violate any contract,\ncompensation plan, law or regulation. For\nexample on July 14, 2014, the Department of\nJustice \u0093announced a $7 billion settlement\nwith a major bank, Citigroup Inc., to resolve\n. . . claims related to Citigroup\u0092s conduct\nin the . . . issuance of residential\nmortgage-backed securities (RMBS) prior to\nJan. 1, 2009. The resolution includes a $4\nbillion civil penalty \u0096 the largest penalty\nto date under the Financial Institutions\nReform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA)\n. . . . Citigroup acknowledged it made\nserious misrepresentations to the public.\u0094\nThis monetary penalty was borne by Citi\nshareholders who were not responsible for\nthis unlawful conduct. Citi employees\ncommitted these unlawful acts. They did not\ncontribute to this penalty payment, but\ninstead undoubtedly received bonuses.\nPresident William Dudley of the New York\nFederal Reserve outlined the utility of what\nhe called a performance bond. \u0093In the case of\na large fine, the senior management . . .\nwould forfeit their performance bond . . . .\nEach individual\u0092s ability to realize their\ndeferred debt compensation would depend not\nonly on their own behavior, but also on the\nbehavior of their colleagues. This would\ncreate a strong incentive for individuals to\nmonitor the actions of their colleagues, and\nto call attention to any issues .. . .\nImportantly, individuals would not be able to\n\u0093opt out\u0094 of the firm as a way of escaping\nthe problem. If a person knew that something\nis amiss and decided to leave the firm, their\ndeferred debt compensation would still be at\nrisk.\u0094 Please vote yes: Management Pay\nClawback Authorization \u0096 Proposal 5\n                               \n  2022 Proxy Statement    113  \n                               \nShareholder Proposals\n\nPolicy for Management Pay Clawback\nAuthorization \u0096 Statement in Opposition Our\nBoard recommends that you vote AGAINST this\nproposal, which is identified as Item 5 on\nthe proxy card, for the following reasons:\n                                              \n      Our existing Clawback and Forfeiture    \n      Policy adequately protects shareholder  \n      interests and in fact is, in several    \n      ways,                                   \n      broader than the proposed policy.       \n                                              \n                                              \n      Our compensation framework integrates   \n      risk and control measures designed to   \n      hold employees accountable for          \n      misconduct and                          \n      failures of risk management.            \n                                              \n                                              \n      Our stock ownership and retention       \n      requirements are designed to            \n      incentivize long-term performance and   \n      effective risk                          \n      management.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      The proposed policy is overly           \n      prescriptive and entirely disregards    \n      individual accountability.              \n                                              \nOur existing Clawback and Forfeiture Policy\nis a key element of our compensation and risk\nmanagement framework. Our Clawback and\nForfeiture Policy goes beyond the objective\nof the proposed policy, which would merely\nrequire executive officer deferred\ncompensation to be forfeited \u0093to help satisfy\nany monetary penalty associated with any\nviolation of law.\u0094 In contrast, our Clawback\nand Forfeiture policy:\n                                              \n      Applies to any employee or former       \n      employee who has received long-term     \n      incentive compensation, which is a      \n      much broader                            \n      population than our executive           \n      officers;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      Permits clawback of equity-based        \n      compensation and certain cash           \n      compensation paid within five years of  \n      the Board authorizing                   \n      a clawback, which is broader than a     \n      policy that permits forfeiture of       \n      unpaid deferred compensation; and       \n                                              \n                                              \n      Empowers the Company to hold employees  \n      accountable for lesser triggers than    \n      violations of law, including            \n      misconduct and risk                     \n      events.                                 \n                                              \nWhile the proposed policy\u0092s only trigger for\nforfeiture is a monetary penalty due to a\nviolation of law (regardless of an\nindividual\u0092s culpability for such violation),\nour Clawback and Forfeiture Policy\u0092s triggers\ninclude, but are not limited to, willful\nmisconduct, gross negligence or errors\ncausing material harm to the Company, failure\nthrough willful misconduct or gross\nnegligence to identify, escalate, monitor or\nmanage material risks, and the Company or an\nemployee\u0092s business group suffering a\nmaterial failure of risk management. Our\nClawback and Forfeiture Policy also enables\nthe Company to adjust compensation paid based\non inaccurate financial information or\nperformance metrics. Our integrated\ncompensation and risk management framework\nincludes robust stock ownership requirements,\nwhich apply to our executive officers until\none year following retirement, and our Code\nof Ethics and Business Conduct, which\nprohibits all employees from engaging in\nderivative or hedging transactions involving\nany Company securities. Together with awards\nthat either vest annually on a pro-ratedbasis\nover multiple years or cliff vest after a\nnumber of years, these policies and practices\nincentivize long-term performance while\ndiscouraging excessive risk-taking. As noted\nabove, the proposed policy disregards\nindividual responsibility, which goes against\nour core compensation principle of linking\npay to performance and is inconsistent with\nbest practices among our peers. The proposed\npolicy is also overly prescriptive in that it\nwould require a substantial portion of\nexecutive officer compensation to be deferred\nfor three years following the absence of a\nmonetary penalty. Not only would this be\nunappealing to potential executive talent,\nbut such a lengthy deferral period is\nunnecessary given our vesting provisions and\nour ability to clawback paid compensation in\nappropriate circumstances. Ultimately, we\nbelieve that a policy that would subject\ncompensation to this risk of forfeiture\nirrespective of personal responsibility and\nin a manner inconsistent with market practice\nwould harm shareholder interests by hampering\nour ability to attract and retain top talent.\nOur existing Clawback and Forfeiture policy,\ncoupled with our integrated compensation and\nrisk management framework, adequately protect\nboth the Company and our shareholders. As\nsuch, the Board believes that this proposal\nis unnecessary and will not further\nshareholder interests. The Board recommends\nthat you vote AGAINST this proposal (Item 5).\n                                              \n  Item 5 \u0096                                     \n  Shareholder Proposal \u0096 Policy for            \n  Management Pay                              \n  Clawback Authorization                      \n  Our Board recommends that you vote AGAINST  \n  this proposal (Item                         \n  5).                                         \n                                              \n                                \n  114    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nShareholder Proposals\n                                              \n  Item\u00a06\u00a0\u0096\u00a0Shareholder\u00a0Proposal\u00a0\u0096\u00a0Report\u00a0on     \n  Incentive-Based\u00a0Compensation and\u00a0Risks\u00a0of\u00a0  \n  Material\u00a0Losses                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  The Comptroller of the State of New York,   \n  Thomas P.

In response, Congress directed\nfederal regulators to examine the financial\nincentives of allbank employees\u0096not just\nexecutives\u0096whose actions can threaten the\nsafety of individual banks or the banking\nsystem itself. Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank\nAct requires regulation to disclose the\nstructures of all incentive-based\ncompensation arrangements to determine\nwhether they could lead to material financial\nloss. A 2016 rulemaking proposed by a variety\nof federal agencies states, \u0093Well-structured\nincentive-based compensation arrangements can\npromote the health of a financial\u00b7institution\nby aligning the interests of executives and\nemployees with those of the institution\u0092s\nshareholders and other stakeholders. At the\nsame time, poorly structured incentive-based\ncompensation arrangements can provide\nexecutives and employees with incentives to\ntake inappropriate risks that are not\nconsistent with the long-term health of the\ninstitution and, in turn, the long-term\nhealth of the U.S. economy.\u0094 Basel III, the\nglobal banking regulatory reform standard,\nurges banks to identify material risk takers\nother than executives and disclose their\nfixed and variable remuneration. Wells Fargo\ndiscloses the compensation of named executive\nofficers but does not disclose information\nregarding the compensation of otheremployees\nwho receive incentive-based compensation, and\nwho could expose our company to material\nlosses. Because investors, like regulators,\nhave significant interests in understanding\nrisks that could expose Wells Fargo to\nmaterial losses, Wells Fargo should disclose\nthis information to shareholders. Robust\nboard-level oversight of workforce issues is\nin the best interest of shareholders. Indeed,\nformer Delaware Chief Justice Leo Strine, Jr.\nadvocates that the board\u0092s compensation\ncommittee \u0093expand its perspective and become\na committee focused on the company\u0092s\nworkforce as a whole.\u0094 RESOLVED, Shareholders\nrequest that the Board prepare a report, at\nreasonable cost, disclosing to the extent\npermitted under applicable law and Wells\nFargo\u0092s contractual, fiduciary or other\nobligations (1) whether and how the Company\nhas identified employees or positions,\nindividually or as part of a group, who are\neligible to receive incentive-based\ncompensation that is tied to metrics that\ncould have the ability to expose Wells Fargo\nto possible material losses, as determined in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples; (2) if the Company has not made\nsuch an identification, an explanation of why\nit has not done so; and (3) if the Company\nhas made such an identification, the:\n                                              \n  (a)    methodology and criteria used to     \n         make such identification;            \n                                              \n                                              \n         number of those                      \n  (b)    employees/positions, broken down by  \n         division;                            \n                                              \n                                              \n         aggregate percentage of              \n         compensation, broken down by         \n  (c)    division, paid to those              \n         employees/positions that             \n         constitutes incentive-based          \n         compensation; and                    \n                                              \n                                              \n         aggregate percentage of such         \n         incentive-based compensation that    \n         is dependent on (i)\u00a0short-term, and  \n  (d)    (ii)\u00a0long-term performance metrics,  \n         in each case as may be defined by    \n         Wells Fargo and with an explanation  \n         of                                   \n         such metrics.                        \n                                              \n                               \n  2022 Proxy Statement    115  \n                               \nShareholder Proposals\n\nIncentive-Based Compensation and Risks of\nMaterial Losses \u0096 Statement in Opposition Our\nBoard recommends a vote AGAINST this\nproposal, which is identified as Item 6 on\nthe proxy card, for the following reasons:\n                                              \n      Our Incentive Compensation Risk         \n      Management (ICRM) and performance       \n      management programs are responsive to   \n      the incentive                           \n      compensation risk concerns raised in    \n      this proposal.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      Through our ICRM program, we identify   \n      and provide for heightened oversight    \n      of employees in roles that may be       \n      able,                                   \n      individually or as a group, to expose   \n      the Company to material risk.           \n                                              \n                                              \n      We believe that the requested report    \n      could provide confidential, sensitive   \n      and competitive information about our   \n      incentive compensation practices in     \n      that it would require us to disclose    \n      an extensive level of detail regarding  \n      compensation for a large group of       \n      employees.                              \n                                              \nAs described in the Performance Management\nand Incentive Compensationsection of this\nproxy statement, we have established a\ncomprehensive set of controls in connection\nwith our ICRM and performance management\nprograms. Consistent with our response to\nthis proposal in each of the past four years,\nwe believe these controls provide the\nappropriate measures to guard against the\nrisks cited in the proposal\u0092s supporting\nstatement. These controls, overseen by\nappropriate management-level committees and,\nultimately, the Board\u0092s Human Resources\nCommittee (the \u0093 HRC\u0094), include:\n                                              \n      A design process for all incentive      \n      compensation plans which includes       \n      review of past performance of existing  \n      plans, a risk                           \n      evaluation to identify key potential    \n      areas of risk, modeling to understand   \n      expected results, scenario testing,     \n      and an assessment of plan               \n      reasonableness.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      An annual risk review of incentive      \n      compensation plans. During this         \n      review, independent control functions   \n      assess risk                             \n      balancing, emerging risks, risk         \n      mitigation features, compliance with    \n      laws, and the plans\u0092 potential to        \n      encourage employees to take             \n      unnecessary or inappropriate risks.     \n                                              \n                                              \n      An assessment of risk accountability    \n      in annual performance reviews for       \n      every Wells Fargo employee, as          \n      described in the                        \n      Performance Management and Incentive    \n      Compensation section of this proxy      \n      statement. The assessments of risk      \n      accountability are considered in        \n      incentive compensation decisions for    \n      all incentive eligible employees.       \n                                              \nAdditionally, the HRC receives periodic\nreports from management to enable it to\nassess whether the overall design and\nexecution of our performance management and\nincentive compensation programs and decisions\nare consistent with the Company\u0092s Risk\nManagement Framework and promote risk\naccountability. These reports cover our\nincentive compensation governance and annual\nrisk review processes and include, for select\nroles, final risk outcomes and corresponding\ncompensation and performance adjustments\nbased upon those risk outcomes. Our ICRM\nprogram covers all incentive-eligible roles\nacross the Company. In addition, we identify\nand provide for heightened oversight of\nemployees in roles that may be able,\nindividually or as a group, to expose the\nCompany to material risk. The determination\nas to whether a role is subject to heightened\noversight is based on a risk review of all\nroles at the Company. This review, conducted\nby our Human Resources, Independent Risk\nManagement and Control Executive teams,\nidentifies the types and levels of risk taken\nby each role. Based on this review, the below\nroles are subject to heightened oversight:\n                           \n      executive officers;  \n                           \n                                              \n      senior management with significant      \n      responsibility for taking,              \n      identifying, managing, or controlling   \n      risk within a line of                   \n      business or corporate function; and     \n                                              \n                                              \n      groups of employees who, in the         \n      aggregate, may expose the organization  \n      to material risk, or are subject to     \n      specific                                \n      regulatory requirements.                \n                                              \nFor roles subject to heightened oversight,\nHuman Resources facilitates a risk review\nduring the annual review cycle, which occurs\nprior to any incentive compensation payouts\nbeing made to employees in these roles. In\naddition, accountability impacts for specific\nkey risk issues are incorporated into the\nassessment of risk management performance as\npart of the annual performance reviews for\nthese roles. We further manage risk and hold\ncertain employees (including certain former\nemployees) accountable through our Clawback\nand Forfeiture Policy, as discussed in more\ndetail under \u0093Clawback and Forfeiture Policy\u0094\nin the Compensation Discussion and\nAnalysissection of this proxy statement. The\nrequested report would require us to disclose\ninformation that could provide confidential,\nsensitive and competitive information about\nour incentive compensation practices and, we\nbelieve, would not meaningfully add to the\nsubstance of our disclosures as\n                                \n  116    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nShareholder Proposals\n\ndescribed above. This would include\ninformation on the mix of compensation paid\nto broad groups of employees, identified by\nbusiness division, including the aggregate\npercentage of compensation paid to those\nemployees that constitutes incentive-based\ncompensation, the aggregate percentage of\nsuch incentive-based compensation that is\nbased on short-term and long-term metrics, as\nwell as an explanation of the metrics. We do\nnot believe that other companies, including\nour competitors, disclose this information.\nAs such, disclosure of this information could\nprovide sensitive and competitive information\nabout our incentive compensation practices\nfor these employees. This could, among other\nthings, facilitate recruitment of these\nemployees by our competitors, while, again,\nnot meaningfully adding to the substance of\nour disclosures. We believe that the\ndisclosures in this proxy statement strike\nthe right balance by providing our\nshareholders with meaningful information that\nenables them to understand and assess our\nincentive compensation risk management and\nperformance management practices while\nprotecting information that may be sensitive\nfor competitive, privacy or other reasons.\nGiven our robust ICRM and performance\nmanagement programs, our disclosures on these\nprograms, and our belief that the requested\nreport could provide competitive information\nabout our incentive compensation practices,\nour Board does not believe that providing\nthis report ultimately serves the best\ninterests of our shareholders. Our Board\nrecommends that you vote AGAINST this\nproposal (Item 6).\n                                              \n  Item 6 \u0096                                     \n  Shareholder Proposal \u0096 Report on             \n  Incentive-Based Compensation and Risks of   \n  Material Losses                             \n  Our Board recommends that you vote AGAINST  \n  this proposal (Item 6).                     \n                                              \n                               \n  2022 Proxy Statement    117  \n                               \nShareholder Proposals\n                                              \n  Item 7 \u0096 Shareholder Proposal \u0096 Racial and    \n  Gender                                      \n  Board Diversity Report                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  Arjuna Capital, 1 Elm Street, Manchester,   \n  MA 01944, on behalf of Judith Ellen         \n  Bamburg, the holder of 116 shares of our    \n  common                                      \n  stock, has advised us that it intends to    \n  introduce the following resolution at our   \n  annual meeting:                             \n                                              \nResolution and Supporting Statement\nWhereas:Our nation\u0092s racial reckoning and\ncoronavirus\u0092s illumination of vast social\ninequities has led companies to reevaluate\ntheir diversity, equity, and inclusion\npolicies and goals.

The\nBoard of Directors is comprised of 25 percent\nwomen and 25 percent minorities, while the\nemployee workforce is comprised of 56 percent\nfemale employees and 45 percent\nracially/ethnically diverse employees. The\ndemographic makeup of the United States, used\nhere as a proxy for its customer base, is\ncomprised of 51 percent women and 42 percent\nminorities. We believe that a Board of\nDirectors with a racial and gender\ncomposition reflective of Wells Fargo\u0092s\nemployee and customer base will more astutely\nminimize business risk, maximize opportunity,\nand increase shareholder value.\nResolved:Shareholders request that Wells\nFargo report annually on its policies and\npractices to help ensure its elected Board of\nDirectors attains racial and gender\nrepresentation that is better aligned with\nthe demographics of its employees and\ncustomers and/or regions in which it\noperates. The report should be prepared at\nreasonable cost, omitting proprietary\ninformation, litigation strategy and legal\ncompliance information.

As a matter of\npractice, the Board considers our Board\ncomposition in light of the diverse\ncommunities and geographies we serve.\nAccordingly, as indicated in the Board\nDiversitysection of this proxy statement, the\nGovernance and Nominating Committee of the\nBoard (the \u0093 GNC\u0094) includes gender, race, and\nethnic diversity as one of its criteria in\nthe director nomination process and\ncommunicates that criterion to third-party\nsearch firms engaged in the process. In\nreviewing potential directors, the GNC\nconsiders the self-identified diversity\ncharacteristics of each director or potential\ndirector candidate. The GNC and our Board\ncontinue to consider opportunities to\nincrease our Board diversity in a way that\nsupports the current and anticipated needs of\nboth the Board and the Company. We also\nbelieve it is important to have not only\ndiverse Board composition but also diversity\namong the Board\u0092s leadership positions. Three\nof our Board committees\u0097the GNC, Corporate\nResponsibility Committee (the \u0093 CRC\u0094), and\nRisk Committee\u0097have Chairs who are gender,\nracially, and/or ethnically diverse. We\nbelieve that the diversity of these Committee\nChairs, as well as the diversity among our\nBoard committee members, underscores the\nBoard\u0092s commitment to diversity, equity, and\ninclusion, including continued enhancement of\nthe Board\u0092s overall diversity. We also\nbelieve that the diverse composition of these\ncommittees supports a diversity of\nperspectives, which we believe, in the long\nterm, will position the Company to increase\nshareholder value. We have enhanced our\ndisclosures over the years regarding our\ncommitment to board diversity. In the Board\nDiversitysection of this proxy statement, we\ndescribe the process for recruiting board\ncandidates and how we integrate diversity\ninto that process. Since 2017, we have\nincluded in our annual proxy statement a\nBoard Qualifications and Experience Matrix,\nwhich, since 2018, has included information\non Board members\u0092 self-identified gender,\nrace, and ethnicity. We believe our current\npractices to continue to enhance our Board\ndiversity and our robust disclosures in our\nproxy statement are responsive to the\nconcerns raised in this proposal. The Board\nrecommends that you vote AGAINST this\nproposal (Item 7).\n                                              \n  Item 7 \u0096                                     \n  Shareholder Proposal \u0096 Racial and Gender     \n  Board Diversity Report \u00a0 Our Board          \n  recommends that you vote AGAINST this       \n  proposal (Item 7).                          \n                                              \n                               \n  2022 Proxy Statement    119  \n                               \nShareholder Proposals\n                                              \n  Item\u00a08\u00a0\u0096\u00a0Shareholder\u00a0Proposal\u00a0\u0096\u00a0Report\u00a0on\u00a0    \n  Respecting\u00a0Indigenous\u00a0Peoples\u0092               \n  Rights                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  American Baptist Home Mission Societies,    \n  1075 First Avenue, King of Prussia, PA      \n  19406, the holder of 127 shares of our      \n  common                                      \n  stock, has advised us that it intends to    \n  introduce the following resolution at our   \n  annual meeting:                             \n                                              \nResolution and Supporting Statement\nResolved:Shareholders request that the Board\nof Directors provide a report to\nshareholders, at reasonable cost and omitting\nproprietary and confidential information,\noutlining how effective Wells Fargo\u0092s\npolicies, practices, and performance\nindicators are in respecting internationally\nrecognized human rights standards for\nIndigenous Peoples\u0092 rights in its existing\nand proposed general corporate and project\nfinancing. Whereas:Internationally-recognized\nstandards for Indigenous Peoples\u0092 rights are\nthe UN Declaration on the Rights of\nIndigenous Peoples and International Labour\nOrganization Convention 169 concerning\nIndigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent\ncountries. 1Violation of the rights of\nIndigenous Peoples presents risks for Wells\nFargo that can adversely affect shareholder\nvalue, including reputational damage, project\ndelays and disruptions, litigation, and\ncriminal charges. 2Wells Fargo adopted the\nEquator Principles (EPs) in 2005, committing\nto only finance projects by borrowers who\nexhibit social and environmental\nresponsibility. 3The company faces\nreputational risk if it finances projects\nthat conflict with its own commitments.\nDespite EP enhancements in 2019 after several\nmembers, including Wells Fargo, failed to\nrespect Indigenous Rights by financing the\nDakota Access pipeline (DAPL), Wells Fargo is\nproviding $3.86 billion in financing for the\nEnbridge Line 3 tar sands pipeline expansion\n\u0093Line 3\u0094. 4 Similar to DAPL, Line 3 poses\nsignificant risks to the land, water, and\ncultural rights of several Anishinaabe\ntribes. The expansion violates numerous\nrights of Indigenous Peoples as protected by\ninternational law, including the rights to\nfree, prior, and informed consent (FPIC);\nhealth; culture; religion; security; and\nassembly. 5In particular, Line 3 threatens\naccess to and health of manoomin ,or wild\nrice, which is central to the survival of\nAnishinaabe culture. 6The pipeline, with\nestimated emissions equivalent to 50 coal\nplants, significantly contributes to climate\nchange, disparately affecting Tribes.\n7Enbridge and its partners have consistently\nfailed to meet the international standard of\nFPIC as well as domestic standards of\nconsultation with the Anishinaabe. 8 Line 3\npresents similar material risks as DAPL,\nwhich was estimated to incur over $7.5\nbillion in costs due to material social\nrisks. 9Line 3 has a history of ruptures and\nspills, most recently spilling approximately\n10,000 gallons of drilling fluid between July\nand August 2021. 10The project has been the\nsubject of numerous lawsuits, including\nchallenges to the Clean Water Act permit and\ntribal court litigation on the natural rights\nof manoomin. 11 Furthermore, militarized\nresponse to protests and alleged violation of\nconstitutional rights exposes Wells Fargo to\nreputational and litigation risk. 12Enbridge\nhas reimbursed U.S. law enforcement over $2\nmillion for policing protests against the\nconstruction of Line 3. 13Tactics included\nrubber bullets, pepper spray, solitary\nconfinement in jail, denial of medications,\nand the bringing of excessive or\ninappropriate charges. 14There have been over\n900 arrests, citations, and charges levied\nagainst Water Protectors, as well as\nharassment, surveillance, 15instances of sex\ntrafficking, and violence against women. 16\n                                              \n  1    https://www.un.org/development/desa/\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NO\u2026  \n  :12100:0::NO::P12100 INSTRUMENT ID:312314   \n                                              \n                                              \n  2    https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  3    https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/as\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  4    https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploa\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  5    https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  6    https://static1.squarespace.com/stat\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  7    https://mn350.org/giant-step-backwar\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  8    https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treatie\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  9    https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  10    https://minnesotareformer.com/2021/\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n        https://www.hcn.org/articles/latest\u2026  \n  11    pipeline#:~:text=it%20declared%20th\u2026  \n        %2C%20recovery%2C%20and20preservati\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n        https://www.protestlaw.org/line3 ;

The           \n      Statement also articulates our          \n      approach to responsible financing when  \n      Wells Fargo financing may have impacts  \n      on Indigenous communities.              \n                                              \n                                              \n      Our Board believes that the report      \n      requested by the proponents on the      \n      effectiveness of Wells Fargo\u0092s policies  \n      and                                     \n      procedures in protecting the rights of  \n      Indigenous Peoples in lending and       \n      investment decisions, would             \n      inappropriately require disclosure of   \n      proprietary business decisions, and     \n      potentially, confidential customer      \n      information, and is unnecessary in      \n      light of our existing principles and    \n      risk management practices, including    \n      the Statement, for respecting the       \n      rights of Indigenous communities.       \n                                              \nWe understand that the identities and\ncultures of Indigenous Peoples are\ninextricably linked to the lands on which\nthey live, and we respect their rights to\ndetermine their own way of life on their own\nlands, according to their time-honored\ncultures, traditions and beliefs. In\nacknowledgement of these rights, we adopted\nthe Statement, which was developed in\npartnership with tribal leaders, Indigenous\ncommunities\u0092 stakeholders, and their\nrepresentatives in 2017, and was subsequently\nupdated in 2019. The Statement describes\nWells Fargo\u0092s commitment to treating\nIndigenous Peoples with dignity and respect,\nand articulates our approach when Wells Fargo\nfinancing may have impacts on Indigenous\ncommunities. To help us identify, evaluate,\nand manage complex environmental and social\nissues in our financing and investment\nbusinesses we have developed robust due\ndiligence practices and procedures, including\nour Environmental and Social Risk Management\nFramework (which can be found at\nhttps://www.wellsfargo.com/about/corporate-\nresponsibility/environmental-social-risk-\nmanagement/). These practices help us confirm\nthat our financing activities are adequately\nreviewed and assessed for, among other\nthings, environmental and social risks,\nincluding potential impacts to Indigenous\ncommunities. In addition to our robust due\ndiligence framework for analyzing\ntransactions that may impact an indigenous\ncommunity, we are dedicated to serving\nIndigenous communities with products,\nservices, and financial education programs\ntailored to help tribal clients, tribal\ngovernments, tribal enterprises, and tribal\nmembers succeed financially. Wells Fargo has\ncommitted $3 billion in credit to and holds\n$3.9 billion in deposits for tribal\ngovernments and tribally owned businesses.\nSince 2018, we have donated more than $50\nmillion to nonprofit organizations serving\nAmerican Indian, Alaska Native and Native\nHawaiian communities, including for COVID-19\nrelief, housing affordability, financial\nhealth, environmental sustainability, small\nbusiness growth, and scholarships. Our Board\nbelieves that developing the report requested\nby the proposal would be both time consuming\nand costly without adding significant value\nto our shareholders and would require\ninappropriate disclosure of our proprietary\nbusiness decisions, as well as confidential\ninformation about customers involved in a\nparticular financing or investment\ntransaction. Given this, in addition to our\nexisting principles articulated in the\nStatement, and our robust due diligence\npractices and processes, we do not believe\nthat providing the requested report\nultimately serves the best interests of our\nshareholders. Accordingly, the Board\nrecommends that you vote AGAINST this\nproposal (Item 8).\n                                              \n  Item\u00a08                                      \n  \u0096 Shareholder Proposal \u0096 Report on            \n  Respecting Indigenous                       \n  Peoples\u0092 Rights                              \n  Our Board recommends that you vote AGAINST  \n  this proposal (Item                         \n  8).                                         \n                                              \n                               \n  2022 Proxy Statement    121  \n                               \nShareholder Proposals\n                                              \n  Item 9 \u0096 Shareholder Proposal \u0096 Climate       \n  Change                                      \n  Policy                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  The Sierra Club Foundation, 2101 Webster    \n  Street, Suite 1250, Oakland, CA 94612, the  \n  holder of 435 shares of our common stock,   \n  and                                         \n  three co-filers have advised us that they   \n  intend to introduce the following           \n  resolution at our annual meeting:           \n                                              \nResolution and Supporting Statement\nResolved:Shareholders request that the Board\nof Directors adopt a policy by the end of\n2022 committing to proactive measures to\nensure that the company\u0092s lending and\nunderwriting do not contribute to new fossil\nfuel development, consistent with fulfilling\nthe United Nations Environmental Program\nFinance Initiative (UNEP FI) recommendations\nto the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group,\nand the International Energy Agency (IEA)\u0092s\nNet Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE),\nfor credible net zero commitments. SUPPORTING\nSTATEMENT The Wells Fargo (WFC) loan\nportfolio is heavily exposed to borrowers\nbeset by climate risk; WFC discloses, for\nexample, more than $40 billion of unpaid loan\nbalances relating to properties located in\nflood zones. 1Moreover, WFC acknowledges in\nits 2020 CDP Climate Change questionnaire\nthat \u0093[i]f emerging regulations and policies\nimpact customers\u0092 operating environments\nnegatively, the bank could be exposed to\nrevenue erosion which could lead to lower\ncapital ratios through decreased retained\nearnings or asset quality decay.\u0094 2Finally,\nrecent movement toward tying bank capital\nreserve requirements to loan-book climate\nrisk by the European Central Bank and Bank of\nEngland affect WFC\u0092s operations in those\nregions. WFC is a member of the Net Zero\nBanking Alliance (NZBA), for which our CEO\ncommitted to align with pathways consistent\nwith a maximum temperature rise of 1.5\ndegrees Celsius above pre-industriallevels,\nutilizing decarbonization scenarios from\n\u0093credible and well-recognized sources.\u0094 3\nHowever, membership in the Alliance does not\nnecessarily equate with alignment with global\nclimate goals. The UNEP FI, which convenes\nthe NZBA, published an Input Paper to the G20\nSustainable Finance Working Group which\ndefines credible net zero commitments of\nfinancial institutions, including: \u0093A\nfinancial institution establishing a net-\nzerocommitment should begin aligning with the\nrequired assumptions and implications of IPCC\n1.5\u00b0C no/low overshoot pathways as soon as\npossible....All no/low overshoot scenarios\nindicate an immediate reduction in fossil\nfuels, signaling that investment in new\nfossil fuel development is not aligned with\n1.5\u00b0C.\u0094 4Another of the world\u0092s most credible\nsources, the IEA, in its NZE scenario, states\nthat \u0093no fossil fuel exploration is required\nand no new oil and natural gas fields are\nrequired beyond those that have already been\napproved for development.\u0094 5WFC has\nrestricted financing for new coal operations\nand Arctic drilling, but has no policy to\nhalt financing any new oil and gas\nexploration and development. The Banking on\nClimate Chaos report shows WFC as the fourth-\nhighest financier of companies expanding\nfossil fuels. 6 WFC faces two associated\nproblems: first, its prominence in asserting\nclimate leadership flies in the face of its\nactions, creating reputational risk from\naccusations of greenwashing; second,\nunderwriting or lending to projects which are\nunneeded under the UNEP FI recommendations or\nIEA NZE scenario potentially loads stranded\nassets onto its balance sheet or those of its\ncustomers. In this regard, investors need to\nknow that WFC\u0092s lending and underwriting\npolicies are consistent with its own net zero\ncommitment.\n                                              \n  1    https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/as\u2026  \n       at 29.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  2    https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/as\u2026  \n       request.pdf, at 22.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  3    https://www.unepfi.org/wordpress/wp-\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  4    https://g20.sfwg.org/wp-content/uplo\u2026  \n       at 15.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  5    https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/as\u2026  \n       at 100.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  6    https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploa\u2026  \n       at 38.                                 \n                                              \n                                \n  122    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nShareholder Proposals\n\nClimate Change Policy \u0096 Statement in\nOpposition Our Board recommends a vote\nAGAINST this proposal, which is identified as\nItem 9 on the proxy card, for the following\nreason:\n                                              \n      Wells Fargo set a goal of net-zero      \n      greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and    \n      committed                               \n      to setting interim emissions targets    \n      for the Oil\u00a0& Gas and Power portfolios  \n      no later than the end of 2022. Setting  \n      targets for carbon-intensive sectors    \n      is the approach banks are implementing  \n      to operationalize their net-zero        \n      commitments. This approach is guided    \n      by leading industry groups, such as     \n      the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA),   \n      which we joined in October 2021.        \n                                              \n                                              \n      Wells Fargo finances clients in a       \n      broad range of sectors of the U.S.      \n      economy and intends to continue         \n      working with clients                    \n      during their transition to a            \n      low-carbon society. Implementing the    \n      proposal\u0092s recommended policy \u0096 to stop   \n      lending and underwriting activities     \n      that contribute to new fossil fuel      \n      development \u0096                            \n      would effectively preclude us from      \n      offering general purpose loans to the   \n      Oil\u00a0& Gas sector. We do not believe     \n      this approach is reasonable based on    \n      current energy usage and the potential  \n      negative impacts such a restrictive     \n      policy could have                       \n      on the U.S. economy. Rather, we         \n      believe our target-setting approach     \n      and ongoing participation in financing  \n      the new capabilities and resources Oil  \n      & Gas companies will need for the       \n      future, coupled with our continued and  \n      substantial                             \n      investment in renewable solar and wind  \n      power projects, will better facilitate  \n      an orderly and balanced transition      \n      away from high-emitting hydrocarbons.   \n                                              \n                                              \n      Although the International Energy       \n      Agency\u0092s (IEA) scenario cited in the     \n      proposal assumes no new oil and gas     \n      developments are needed to attain net   \n      zero, the IEA scenario is only one of   \n      several scenarios, and these other      \n      scenarios do not make this same         \n      assumption. We do not believe that      \n      conditioning our financing on a single  \n      assumption in a single scenario         \n      \u0096 which itself contains hundreds of      \n      other assumptions \u0096 is an effective or   \n      practical way to manage our lending     \n      practices or to further our net-zero    \n      goal.                                   \n                                              \nIn March 2021, we announced our goal of net-\nzerogreenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and are\ntaking steps towards that goal, including\ndeveloping a methodology to set science-based\ntargets for carbon-intensive sectors and\njoining the NZBA, an industry-ledleadership\ngroup that supports more than 100 bank\nmembers in aligning their financing\nactivities with net-zerogoals. At the time we\nannounced our net-zerogoal, we also committed\nto setting emissions targets for our Oil &\nGas and Power portfolios no later than the\nend of 2022 and have made substantial\nprogress toward satisfying that commitment.\nWe intend to publicly disclose interim\nemissions targets for these two sectors and\nour methodology for calculating emissions\nthis year. Consistent with NZBA guidelines,\nwe expect that we will augment these targets\nwith transition plans that identify actions\nto meet the targets. We are not proceeding\ndown this path alone. Setting targets for\ncarbon-intensive sectors is the approach\nbanks are implementing to operationalize\ntheir net-zerocommitments. This approach is\nguided by NZBA expectations for members to\nset targets for key high-emitting sectors and\ndevelop specific measures to realize these\ntargets. As we set targets and subsequently\ntrack progress against them, Wells Fargo\nplans to continue serving companies in a\nbroad range of sectors. We value our client\nrelationships and plan to continue working\nwith clients during the transition to a low-\ncarboneconomy. The policy the proposal\nsuggests we adopt \u0096 to stop lending and\nunderwriting activities that contribute to\nnew fossil fuel development \u0096 runs counter to\nour efforts to partner with our clients as\nthey face challenges inherent in the energy\nindustry\u0092s transformation. Adopting such a\npolicy would effectively preclude us from\noffering general purpose loans to the Oil &\nGas sector. We do not believe this approach\nis reasonable based on current energy usage\nand the potential negative impacts such a\nrestrictive policy could have on the U.S.\neconomy. Rather, we believe our target-\nsetting approach and ongoing participation in\nfinancing the new capabilities and resources\nOil & Gas companies will need for the future\nwill better facilitate an orderly and\nbalanced transition away from high-emitting\nhydrocarbons. Although the IEA\u0092s net-\nzeroscenario cited by the proposal assumes no\nnew fossil fuel development is necessary to\nattain net zero, the IEA scenario is only one\nof several scenarios, and these other\nscenarios do not make this same assumption.\nNotably, the Network for Greening the\nFinancial System (NGFS) Net Zero 2050\nscenario does not assume an immediate\ncessation of investment in new oil and gas\nexploration as part of its pathway to achieve\nnet-zeroemissions. Moreover, climate\nscenarios, including the IEA\u0092s net-\nzeroscenario, contain hundreds of other\nassumptions. We are viewing these assumptions\ntogether, not in isolation, to apply the\nscenario holistically as we develop\nportfolio-wide emissions targets for the Oil\n& Gas and Power sectors. We do not believe\nthat conditioning our financing on a single\nassumption in a single scenario is an\neffective or practical way to manage our\nlending practices or further our net-\nzerogoal. For the reasons stated above, we do\nnot believe that adopting the policy\nrecommended by the proposal would ultimately\nserve the best interests of our shareholders.\nThe Board recommends that you vote AGAINST\nthe proposal (Item 9).\n                                              \n  Item\u00a09                                      \n  \u0096 Shareholder Proposal \u0096 Climate Change       \n  Policy \u00a0 Our Board recommends that you      \n  vote AGAINST this proposal (Item 9).        \n                                              \n                               \n  2022 Proxy Statement    123  \n                               \nShareholder Proposals\n                                              \n  Item 10 \u0096 Shareholder Proposal \u0096 Conduct a    \n  Racial                                      \n  Equity Audit                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  Service Employees International Union       \n  Pension Plans Master Trust, 1800            \n  Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Suite 301,        \n  Washington, DC                              \n  20036-1202, the holder of shares of our     \n  common stock with a market value in excess  \n  of $2,000, has advised us that it intends   \n  to introduce the following resolution at    \n  our annual meeting:                         \n                                              \nResolution and Supporting Statement RESOLVED\nthat shareholders of Wells Fargo & Company\n(\u0093WFC\u0094) urge the Board of Directors to\noversee an independent racial equity audit\nanalyzing WFC\u0092s adverse impacts on nonwhite\nstakeholders and communities of color.

SUPPORTING\nSTATEMENT High-profile police killings of\nblack people \u0096 most recently George Floyd \u0096\nhave galvanized the movement for racial\njustice. That movement, together with the\ndisproportionate impacts of the\nCOVID-19pandemic have focused the attention\nof the media, the public and policy makers on\nsystemic racism, racialized violence and\ninequities in employment, health care, and\nthe criminal justice system. In June 2020,\nWFC CEO Charles Scharf urged that \u0093the\ninequality and discrimination that has been\nso clearly exposed . . . must not continue,\u0094\nand WFC announced initiatives to improve\nworkforce diversity and inclusion and invest\nin black-owned businesses. 1Those actions\nfollowed some missteps: Scharf\u0092s statement\nthat he appointed white men to top jobs after\narriving at WFC because of \u0093a very limited\npool of Black talent,\u0094 demoralizing black\nemployees, and the loss of black female top\nmanagers. 2 WFC\u0092s problems predate Scharf\u0092s\n2019 arrival. WFC has settled employment\ndiscrimination claims on several recent\noccasions, including incidents of race\ndiscrimination in 2014 uncovered through a\nLabor Department audit. In 2019, WFC settled\na lawsuit by the City of Philadelphia\nalleging that WFC targeted nonwhite\nneighborhoods for high-feeand high-interest\nrate loans. 3In 2012, the same practices led\nto a $184 million Department of Justice\nsettlement. A 2021 investigation found racial\ndisparities in WFC\u0092s lending under the\nPaycheck Protection Program in Los Angeles:\nbusinesses in majority-white neighborhoods\nwere more than twice as likely to receive\nfunding as businesses in majority-nonwhite\nneighborhoods. 4 WFC\u0092s activities with\npotential adverse impacts are not limited to\nthe employment and lending contexts. WFC has\nsupported numerous police foundations, which\nbypass normal procurement processes to buy\nequipment for police departments, including\nsurveillance technology that has been used to\ntarget communities of color and nonviolent\nprotestors. In the 2020 election cycle, WFC\ngave $135,000 to members of Congress who\nobjected to certifying the election results,\n5an action some viewed as \u0093a direct attack on\nthe voting rights of people of color.\u0094\n6Although WFC paused PAC contributions after\nthe insurrection, it resumed them following a\nreview of its criteria. WFC is a member of\nthe American Bankers Association, which\ncontinues to donate to objecting members. 7 A\nracial equity audit would help WFC identify,\nprioritize, remedy and avoid adverse impacts\non nonwhite stakeholders and communities of\ncolor. We urge WFC to assess its behavior\nthrough a racial equity lens in order to\nobtain a complete picture of how it\ncontributes to, and could help dismantle,\nsystemic racism.\n                                              \n  1    See                                    \n       https://stories.wf.com/wells-fargo-c\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  2    https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-f\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  3    https://whyy.org/articles/wells-farg\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  4    https://www.latimes.com/california/s\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  5    https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n       See                                    \n  6    https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/u\u2026  \n       https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bu\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  7    https://www.citizensforethics.org/re\u2026  \n                                              \n                                \n  124    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nShareholder Proposals\n\nRacial Equity Audit \u0096 Statement in Opposition\nOur Board recommends a vote AGAINST this\nproposal, which is identified as Item 10 on\nthe proxy card, for the following reasons:\n                                              \n      Our Board believes that the Company\u0092s    \n      significant and ongoing diversity,      \n      equity, and inclusion (DE&I)            \n      initiatives and its existing and        \n      planned future disclosures of these     \n      efforts are responsive to the           \n      proposal. Additionally, consistent      \n      with our commitment in 2021, we expect  \n      to provide a disclosure, prior to the   \n      filing of this proxy statement,         \n      related to the Human Rights Impact      \n      Assessment, which includes a DE&I       \n      focus.                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      The Company has worked to integrate     \n      DE&I across the enterprise. In 2021,    \n      the Company added                       \n      dedicated Diverse Segment Leader roles  \n      in each customer-facing line of         \n      business. Beginning in 2020, the        \n      Company launched forums in which        \n      executives from underrepresented        \n      groups share, on a regular basis,       \n      their perspectives and ideas with our   \n      CEO and                                 \n      other senior leaders on how to improve  \n      the experience of diverse employees     \n      and customers. Initiatives that result  \n      from these forum discussions are        \n      tracked and reviewed regularly.         \n                                              \n                                              \n      The Company has focused on increasing   \n      executive accountability by linking     \n      DE&I outcomes to compensation.          \n                                              \n                                              \n      Additionally, Wells Fargo has launched  \n      a number of new initiatives aimed at    \n      supporting communities of color and     \n      addressing systemic economic            \n      inequities including its Banking        \n      Inclusion Initiative, a 10-year         \n      commitment to help unbanked             \n      individuals gain access to affordable,  \n      mainstream, digitally-enabled           \n      transactional                           \n      accounts, its investment in Minority    \n      Depository Institutions, and its        \n      commitment to the Black Economic        \n      Alliance Entrepreneurs Fund, among      \n      others.                                 \n                                              \nWe have significantly increased our focus on\nour DE&I strategy, which we believe enables\nthe Company to play a positive role in\nsupporting diverse stakeholders including its\nemployees, customers, suppliers, and\ncommunities.We acknowledge the importance of\nactive and ongoing engagement with our\nstakeholders, including listening to and\nlearning from our employees, customers and\nother stakeholders. In 2021 ,under the\noversight of the Board\u0092s Corporate\nResponsibility Committee, Wells Fargo engaged\na third-party law firm with human rights\nexpertise to conduct a Human Rights Impact\nAssessment (\u0093 HRIA\u0094), with a focus on DE&I,\nto help us gain better insights into where\nour stakeholders perceive we have positive\nand negative human rights impacts. We expect\nto provide a disclosure related to the HRIA\nprior to the filing of this proxy statement.\nWe also provide extensive information\nregarding our DE&I activities through our\nCompany\u0092s ESG reporting, DE&I webpage and\nthis proxy statement. Some of this\ninformation can be found at https://www.wells\nfargo.com/about/diversity/diversity-and-\ninclusion and\nhttps://www.wellsfargo.com/about/corporate-\nresponsibility/goals-and-reporting/. Wells\nFargo is developing and implementing a\ncomprehensive DE&I agenda that focuses on\nsustainable progress and lasting impact. In\nNovember 2020, our CEO created the Diverse\nSegments, Representation, and Inclusion (\u0093\nDSRI\u0094) department and hired Kleber Santos as\nthe Head of DSRI. In this role, Mr. Santos\nreports directly to our CEO and serves on the\ncompany\u0092s Operating Committee. Over the past\nyear, the Company made significant progress\non its DE&I priorities within Wells Fargo and\nin its engagement with customers, suppliers,\nand communities. In 2021, to further embed a\nDE&I focus in each line of business, Diverse\nSegment leader roles were created, each with\ndual reporting responsibilities to the Head\nof DSRI and the Head of the appropriate\nbusiness unit. Additionally, starting in\n2020, the Company began launching executive\nforums made up of senior leaders from\nunderrepresented groups. Through these\nforums, which occur on a regular basis, these\nleaders propose to, and discuss with, the\nOperating Committee members, including our\nCEO, recommendations to improve the employee\nand customer experience at Wells Fargo. In\n2021, these leaders also participated in a\nyear-endstrategy session with our CEO and\nother DSRI Leaders with the intent to create\ngreater accountability on DE&I progress,\nreflect on accomplishments, and strategize\nfor the upcoming year. In 2021, Wells Fargo\nadded a new DE&I executive performance\nobjective for senior leaders that is directly\nconnected to increasing gender, racial/ethnic\nrepresentation in our executive ranks. This\nis now part of the individual performance\nconsideration for our CEO and each Operating\nCommittee member as described in the\nCompensation Discussion and Analysissection\nof this proxy statement. In addition, as part\nof the Company\u0092s employee expectations, in\n2020 Wells Fargo rolled out a DE&I\nperformance objective for all managers and\nemployees. Moreover, we continue our focus on\nsupporting communities of color. Through the\nBanking Inclusion Initiative\u0097a\n10-yearcommitment to help unbanked\nindividuals gain access to affordable,\nmainstream, digitally-enabled transactional\naccounts\u0097we aim to create a meaningful entry\npoint to facilitate full participation in the\neconomy and achievement of financial\nstability. The initiative will focus on\nreaching unbanked communities and, in\nparticular, helping remove barriers to\nfinancial inclusion for Black and African\nAmerican, Hispanic, and Native\nAmerican/Alaska Native families, which\naccording to the 2019 FDIC Survey of\nHousehold Use of Banking and Financial\nServices (released October 2020), account for\nmore than half of America\u0092s 7 million\nunbanked households.\n                               \n  2022 Proxy Statement    125  \n                               \nShareholder Proposals\n\nAdditionally, as of May 2021, Wells Fargo\nmade investments in a total of 13 Minority\nDepository Institutions ( MDIs) and fulfilled\nour March 2020 announcement committing $50\nmillion to Black-owned banks in communities\nacross the country. As part of this equity\ncapital investment, the Company will offer\naccess to a dedicated relationship team that\ncan work with each MDI on financial,\ntechnological, and product development\nstrategies to help strengthen each\ninstitution and support growth. MDIs are a\nviable and very important sector of the\nbanking industry that can directly support\nthe financial health of communities where\ntypically there are gaps in banking services.\nThese investments will complement the\nCompany\u0092s community development efforts while\npositively impacting people in many\ncommunities we serve. Also in 2021, with the\nsupport of Wells Fargo, the Black Economic\nAlliance launched the Black Economic Alliance\nEntrepreneurs Fund (the \u0093 BEA Fund\u0094) to\naccelerate the growth of Black entrepreneurs\nand business owners. Wells Fargo has\ncommitted to investing $20 million over five\nyears and will also contribute our expertise\nas the BEA Fund begins working with small\nbusiness owners and start-ups. Our DE&I\nstrategy extends to the Company\u0092s\nphilanthropic activities. For example, Wells\nFargo donated the gross processing fees\nreceived in 2020 from funding of Paycheck\nProtection Program loans to create the Open\nfor Business Fund, which supports Community\nDevelopment Financial Institutions (CDFIs)\nand other nonprofit organizations that serve\ndiverse small businesses. In 2021, the\nCompany fully deployed its $420 million\ncommitment, which included grants to 235\nCDFIs and nonprofits. Approximately 85% of\nthose served by Open for Business Fund\ngrantees are projected to be Black, African\nAmerican, Hispanic, Native American, Asian\nAmerican, and other traditionally underserved\nsmall businesses most disproportionally\nimpacted by the pandemic. Given our\ncomprehensive approach to DE&I, with\ncontinued oversight from our Board,\nmanagement accountability, and our robust\nDE&I disclosures, we do not believe that\nperforming a Racial Equity Audit ultimately\nserves the best interests of our\nshareholders. The Board recommends that you\nvote AGAINST this proposal (Item 10).\n                                              \n  Item 10 \u0096                                    \n  Shareholder Proposal \u0096 Conduct a Racial      \n  Equity Audit \u00a0 Our Board recommends that    \n  you vote AGAINST this proposal (Item 10).   \n                                              \n                                \n  126    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nShareholder Proposals\n                                             \n  Item 11 \u0096 Shareholder Proposal \u0096 Charitable  \n  Donations Disclosure                       \n                                             \n                                              \n  National Legal and Policy Center, 107 Park  \n  Washington Court, Falls Church, VA 22046,   \n  the holder of no fewer than 100 shares of   \n  our common stock, has advised us that it    \n  intends to introduce the following          \n  resolution at our annual meeting:           \n                                              \nResolution and Supporting Statement Request\nfor Charitable Donation Disclosure RESOLVED:\nThe shareholders request that Wells Fargo &\nCompany provide a report, published on the\ncompany\u0092s website and updated semi-annually \u0096\nand omitting proprietary information and at\nreasonable cost \u0096 that discloses, itemizes\nand quantifies all Company charitable\ndonations, aggregated by recipient name &\naddress each year for contributions that\nexceed $999 annually.

The\nexpenditure or distribution of corporate\nassets, including charitable contributions,\nshould be consistent with shareholder\ninterests. Accordingly, the Company\u0092s\npolicies and procedures for charitable\ncontributions should be disclosed to\nshareholders. Company executives exercise\nwide discretion over the use of corporate\nassets for charitable purposes. Absent a\nsystem of transparency and accountability for\ncharitable contributions, Company executives\nmay use Company assets for objectives that\nare not shared by and may be inimical to the\ninterests of the Company and its\nshareholders. Current disclosure is\ninsufficient to allow the Company\u0092s Board,its\nshareholders, and its currentand prospective\ncustomers to fully evaluate the charitable\nuse of corporate assets.

On our    \n      Corporate Responsibility webpage under  \n      \u0093Community Giving,\u0094 we describe our       \n      policy for charitable contributions.    \n      It also provides detailed policy and    \n      procedural information including        \n      additional information on how we        \n      prioritize local                        \n      community grants, grant eligibility,    \n      and information about the grant         \n      application process.                    \n                                              \n                               \n  2022 Proxy Statement    127  \n                               \nShareholder Proposals\n                                              \n      While not charitable donations,         \n      various disclosures about our           \n      political activities and contributions  \n      to groups organized                     \n      under Section\u00a0501(c)(4) of the          \n      Internal Revenue Code can be found on   \n      our Corporate Responsibility website    \n      under \u0093Government Relations and Public   \n      Policy.\u0094                                 \n                                              \nThe bulk of Wells Fargo\u0092s charitable\ncontributions are provided through the Wells\nFargo Foundation (the \u0093 Foundation\u0094), a\nprivate non-profitfoundation, which complies\nwith U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u0093 IRS\u0094)\nrules requiring annual disclosure via Form\n990 of, among other things, details of its\ngrantmaking. To demonstrate our commitment to\ntransparency and to make it easier for those\nseeking details on the Foundation\u0092s\ngrantmaking, we began publishing the\nFoundation\u0092s Form 990 on our website in\nJanuary 2022. Included in the Form 990 are\nthe names of the charitable organizations the\nFoundation supports, their addresses, as well\nas the general purposes and amounts of the\ngrants. Organizations receiving funding from\nthe Foundation must have a tax-exemptstatus\nunder IRS code 501(c)(3) or be a qualified\ngovernmental agency, tribal entity or public\nschool or school system. The Form 990 can be\nfound on our Corporate Responsibilitywebsite\nunder \u0093Environmental, Social and Governance\nGoals and Reporting.\u0094 We also provide\nadditional disclosures via our interactive\nImpact Map, which can be found at\nhttps://welcome.wf.com/impact/. The Impact\nMap complements and expands the information\nin the form 990 described above and includes\nthe name of the charitable entity, its\nlocation, and its mission. This interactive\ntool provides detailed information about\nWells Fargo\u0092s charitable contributions, which\ncan be filtered by geographical location\nand/or a particular cause that the recipient\nadvances, such as small business growth,\nhousing affordability, and financial health,\nfor example. Wells Fargo also provides\ninformation on our website on how we evaluate\nand approve charitable contributions. Our\napproach to charitable contributions, which\nincludes information on our four strategic\nfocus areas, is disclosed in both our\nCommunity Giving webpage and our Impact\nwebpage, and provides that we are \u0093committed\nto building an inclusive, sustainable\nrecovery for all through a focus on opening\npathways to economic advancement, championing\nsafe, affordable homes, empowering small\nbusinesses to thrive, and enabling a just,\nlow-carboneconomy.\u0094 Our Community Giving\nwebpage also provides information on our\nprocess for evaluating local community grants\nto non-profitsthat align with our four\nstrategic focus areas. Through our Community\nGiving webpage we also list our priorities in\nreviewing grant applications for non-\nprofitorganizations that support low-to\nmoderate-income communities, racial and\nsocial equity, and accelerating an inclusive\neconomy. Information about navigating the\ngrant process, eligibility criteria and\nevaluation considerations is also available\nthrough the same webpage. The proposal also\nrequests disclosure of contributions made to\n501(c)(4) organizations. Entities organized\nunder Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal\nRevenue Code are not considered charitable\norganizations. While contributions to these\norganization are not charitable donations,\nvarious disclosures about our political\nactivities and contributions to groups\norganized under Section 501(c)(4) of the\nInternal Revenue Code can be found on our\nCorporate Responsibilitywebsite under\n\u0093Government Relations and Public Policy.\u0094 Our\nexisting charitable contributions disclosures\npublicly available on our website provide\nextensive information on the bulk of our\ncharitable contributions and offer insights\ninto our charitable giving policies and\nprocedures, as requested in the proposal. The\nBoard believes that the disclosures currently\nin place are fully responsive to the\nproposal.

Shareholders who\nlog in with their valid control number to\nattend our 2022 annual meeting at\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/WFC2022\nwill have an opportunity to submit questions\nvia the virtual meeting website in the\nappropriate question field at or before the\ntime the matters are before the annual\nmeeting for consideration. In addition,\nshareholders may submit questions for a\nperiod of time in advance of the meeting at\nwww.proxyvote.com. Each question should be\naccompanied by your name, be succinct, and\ncover only one topic. We may group,\nsummarize, and answer together questions from\nmultiple shareholders on the same topic or\nthat are otherwise related to avoid\nrepetition. In order to allow other\nshareholders in attendance the ability to ask\na question and the Company to respond to\nthose questions, we may limit each\nshareholder to two questions, whether\nsubmitted prior to or during the annual\nmeeting. Shareholder questions that are not\npertinent to meeting matters or the business\nof the Company, that relate to personal\nfinancial or other matters, that contain\noffensive or derogatory language, or that are\notherwise out of order and not appropriate\nfor the conduct of the annual meeting will\nnot be addressed during the meeting. We will\nrefer questions related to personal matters\nto the appropriate customer service or Human\nResources representative for a response.\n                               \n  2022 Proxy Statement    133  \n                               \nVoting and Other Meeting Information\n                                              \n  Shareholder\u00a0Information\u00a0for\u00a0Future\u00a0Annual\u00a0  \n  Meetings                                    \n                                              \nShareholder Proposals and Director\nNominations for Inclusion in the Proxy\nStatement for the 2023 Annual Meeting\nShareholders interested in submitting a\nproposal for inclusion in the proxy statement\nfor the Company\u0092s annual meeting of\nshareholders in 2023 may do so by following\nthe procedures prescribed in SEC Rule\n14a-8.To be eligible for inclusion,\nshareholder proposals must be received either\nat our principal executive offices at 420\nMontgomery Street, San Francisco, CA 94104\n(Attention: Charles W.

To nominate a\ndirector pursuant to our proxy access\nprovisions, you must comply with all of the\nprocedures, information requirements,\nqualifications and conditions set forth in\nour By-laws. Notice of proxy access director\nnominees must be received by our Corporate\nSecretary at the address above no earlier\nthan the close of business on October 15,\n2022 and no later than the close of business\non November 14, 2022. Other Proposals and\nNominations for Presentation at the 2023\nAnnual Meeting Under our By-Laws,a\nshareholder who wishes to nominate an\nindividual for election to the Board or to\npropose any business to be considered at an\nannual meeting directly at the annual\nmeeting, rather than for inclusion in our\nproxy statement, must deliver advance notice\nof such nomination or business to the Company\nfollowing the procedures in the By-Laws.The\nshareholder must be a shareholder of record\nas of the date the notice is delivered and at\nthe time of the annual meeting. The notice\nmust be in writing and contain the\ninformation specified in the By-Lawsfor a\ndirector nomination or other business. The\nCompany\u0092s 2023 annual meeting is currently\nscheduled to be held on April 25, 2023, and\nto be timely, the notice must be delivered\nnot earlier than the close of business on\nDecember 27, 2022 (the 120 thday prior to the\nfirst anniversary of this year\u0092s annual\nmeeting) and not later than the close of\nbusiness on January 26, 2023 (the 90 thday\nprior to the first anniversary of this year\u0092s\nannual meeting) to both our CEO and Corporate\nSecretary as follows: Charles W.

However,\nif the Company\u0092s 2023 annual meeting is more\nthan 30 days before or more than 60 days\nafter the first anniversary of this year\u0092s\nannual meeting, such notice must be delivered\nnot earlier than the close of business on the\n120 thday prior to the date of the 2023\nannual meeting and not later than the close\nof business on the later of the 90 thday\nprior to the date of the 2023 annual meeting\nor, if the first public announcement of the\ndate of the 2023 annual meeting is less than\n100 days prior to the date of such annual\nmeeting, the 10 thday following the day on\nwhich public announcement of the date of such\nmeeting is first made by the Company. The\nChairman or other officer presiding at the\nannual meeting has the sole authority to\ndetermine whether any nomination or other\nbusiness has been properly brought before the\nmeeting in accordance with our By-\nLaws.Management and any other person duly\nnamed as proxy by a shareholder will have the\nauthority to vote in their discretion on any\nnomination for director or any other business\nat an annual meeting if the Company does not\nreceive notice of the nomination or other\nbusiness matter within the time frames\ndescribed above or where a notice is received\nwithin these time frames, if the shareholder\ndelivering the notice fails to satisfy the\nrequirements of SEC Rule 14a-4. In addition,\nthe deadline for providing notice to the\nCompany under Rule 14a-19, the SEC\u0092s\nuniversal proxy rule, of a stockholder\u0092s\nintent to solicit proxies in support of\nnominees submitted under the advance notice\nbylaws for our 2023 annual meeting is\nFebruary 25, 2023. The requirements described\nabove are separate from the procedures you\nmust follow to recommend a nominee for\nconsideration by the GNC for election as a\ndirector as described under Director Election\nStandard and Nomination Processand from the\nrequirements that a shareholder must meet in\norder to have a shareholder proposal pursuant\nto SEC Rule 14a-8or a proxy access director\nnominee under our By-Lawsincluded in our\nproxy statement.\n                                \n  134    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nVoting and Other Meeting Information\n                     \n  Other\u00a0Information  \n                     \nCost of Soliciting Proxies We pay the cost of\nsoliciting proxies. We have retained D.F.\nKing & Co., Inc. to help the Board solicit\nproxies. We expect to pay approximately\n$35,000 plus out-of-pocketexpenses for its\nhelp. Members of the Board and our employees\nmay also solicit proxies for us by mail,\ntelephone, e-mail,or in person. We will not\npay our directors or employees any extra\namounts for soliciting proxies. We may, upon\nrequest, reimburse brokerage firms, banks, or\nsimilar entities representing street name\nholders for their expenses in forwarding the\nnotice of internet availability of proxy\nmaterials and/or proxy materials to their\ncustomers who are street name holders and\nobtaining their voting instructions.\nElectronic Delivery of Proxy Materials We use\nthe SEC notice and access rule that allows us\nto furnish our proxy materials to our\nshareholders over the internet instead of\nmailing paper copies of those materials. As a\nresult, beginning on or about March 14, 2022,\nwe sent to our shareholders of record a\nnotice of internet availability of proxy\nmaterials containing instructions on how to\naccess our proxy materials over the internet\nand vote online. This notice is not a proxy\ncard and cannot be used to vote your shares.\nIf you received only a notice, you will not\nreceive paper copies of the proxy materials\nunless you request the materials by following\nthe instructions on the notice or on the\nwebsite referred to on the notice. We\nprovided some of our shareholders, including\nshareholders who have previously requested to\nreceive paper copies of the proxy materials\nand some of our shareholders who are\nparticipants in our benefit plans, with paper\ncopies of the proxy materials instead of a\nnotice that the materials are electronically\navailable over the internet. If you received\npaper copies of the proxy materials, we\nencourage you to help us save money and\nreduce the environmental impact of delivering\npaper proxy materials to shareholders by\nsigning up to receive all of your future\nproxy materials electronically, as described\nbelow. If you own shares of common stock in\nmore than one account\u0097for example, in a joint\naccount with your spouse and in your\nindividual brokerage account\u0097you may have\nreceived more than one notice or more than\none set of paper proxy materials. To vote all\nof your shares by proxy, please follow each\nof the separate proxy voting instructions\nthat you received for your shares of common\nstock held in each of your different\naccounts. How to Receive Future Proxy\nMaterials Electronically Shareholders can\nsign up to receive proxy materials\nelectronically, and will receive an\ne-mailprior to next year\u0092s annual meeting\nwith links to the proxy materials, which may\ngive them faster delivery of the materials\nand will help us save printing and mailing\ncosts and conserve natural resources. Your\nelection to receive proxy materials by\ne-mailwill remain in effect until you\nterminate your election. To receive proxy\nmaterials by e-mailin the future, you may\neither go to www.proxyvote.com and follow the\ninstructions to enroll for electronic\ndelivery or follow the instructions on the\nnotice, or if a street name holder, contact\nyour brokerage firm, bank, or other similar\nentity that holds your shares. If you have\npreviously agreed to electronic delivery of\nour proxy materials, but wish to receive\npaper copies of these materials for the\nannual meeting or for future meetings, please\nfollow the instructions on the website\nreferred to on the electronic notice you\nreceived. Householding SEC rules allow a\nsingle copy of the proxy materials or the\nnotice of internet availability of proxy\nmaterials to be delivered to multiple\nshareholders sharing the same address and\nlast name, or who we reasonably believe are\nmembers of the same family and who consent to\nreceiving a single copy of these materials in\na manner provided by these rules. This\npractice is referred to as \u0093householding\u0094 and\ncan result in significant savings of paper\nand mailing costs. Because we are using the\nSEC\u0092s notice and access rule, we will not\nhousehold our proxy materials or notices to\nshareholders of record sharing an address.\nThis means that shareholders of record who\nshare an address will each be mailed a\nseparate notice or paper copy of the proxy\nmaterials. However, we understand that\ncertain brokerage firms, banks, or other\nsimilar entities holding our common stock for\ntheir customers may household proxy materials\nor notices.\n                               \n  2022 Proxy Statement    135  \n                               \nVoting and Other Meeting Information\nShareholders sharing an address whose shares\nof our common stock are held by such an entity\nshould contact such entity if they now receive\n(1) multiple copies of our proxy materials or\nnotices and wish to receive only one copy of\nthese materials per household in the future,\nor (2) a single copy of our proxy materials or\nnotice and wish to receive separate copies of\nthese materials in the future. Additional\ncopies of our proxy materials are available\nupon request by contacting: Wells Fargo &\nCompany MAC #J0193-610 30 Hudson Yards New\nYork, NY 10001-2170 Attention: Corporate\nSecretary 1-866-870-3684\n                                \n  136    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nNotes on non-GAAP financial measures\n                                              \n        We evaluate our business based on     \n        certain ratios that utilize tangible  \n        common equity. Tangible common        \n        equity is a non-GAAP financial        \n        measure and represents total equity   \n        less preferred equity,                \n        noncontrolling interests,             \n        goodwill, certain identifiable        \n        intangible assets (other than MSRs)   \n        and goodwill and other intangibles    \n        on nonmarketable equity securities,   \n        net of applicable deferred taxes.     \n        One of these ratios is return on      \n        average tangible common equity        \n        (ROTCE),                              \n  1.    which represents our annualized       \n        earnings as a percentage of tangible  \n        common equity. The methodology of     \n        determining tangible common equity    \n        may differ among companies.           \n        Management believes that return on    \n        average tangible common equity,       \n        which utilizes                        \n        tangible common equity, is a useful   \n        financial measure because it enables  \n        management, investors, and others to  \n        assess the Company\u0092s use of equity.    \n        The table below provides a            \n        reconciliation of this non-GAAP       \n        financial measure to GAAP financial   \n        measures.                             \n                                              \nNon-GAAP reconciliations Return on Average\nTangible Common Equity\n
