In\naddition, we offer\nfinancial planning,\nprivate banking,\ninvestment management,\nand fiduciary\nservices. We also\nprovide financial\nsolutions to\nbusinesses through\nproducts and services\nincluding traditional\ncommercial loans and\nlines of credit,\nletters of credit,\nasset-based lending,\ntrade financing,\ntreasury management,\nand investment banking\nservices. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, we\nhad four reportable\noperating segments for\nmanagement reporting\npurposes: Consumer\nBanking and Lending;\nCommercial Banking;\nCorporate and\nInvestment Banking;\nand Wealth and\nInvestment Management.\nThe 2021 Annual Report\nto Shareholders\nincludes financial\ninformation and\ndescriptions of these\noperating segments.\nHuman Capital Our\npeople are what set\nWells Fargo apart and\nare critical to our\nsuccess. Wells Fargo\ncontinues to invest in\nour employees by\noffering market\ncompetitive\ncompensation, career-\ndevelopment\nopportunities, a broad\narray of benefits, and\nstrong work-life\nprograms.\n                                              \n  1We do not control this website.

These expectations guide how\nwe lead ourselves, collaborate with our\ncolleagues, and make decisions. The following\nexpectations apply to everyone at Wells Fargo,\nat every level, and in every role: \u2022 Embrace\ncandor \u2022 Do what\u2019s right \u2022 Be great at\nexecution \u2022 Learn and grow \u2022 Champion\ndiversity and inclusion \u2022 Build high-\nperforming teams (for managers) At December\n31, 2021, we had 247,848 active employees,\nwith approximately 84% of employees based in\nthe United States. Our global workforce was\n53% female and 47% male, and our U.S.\nworkforce was 56% female and 44% male. Our\nU.S. workforce was 55% Caucasian/white and 45%\nracially/ethnically diverse. Supporting\nEmployees During the COVID-19 Pandemic .\nKeeping employees safe remains a priority. We\nhave taken measures to enhance the safety in\nour offices and branch locations based on\nguidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention. Safety kits were\noffered to all Wells Fargo employees and free,\nvoluntary, on-site or self-administered\nCOVID-19 testing is available for employees\ncurrently working at Wells Fargo locations in\nthe U.S. Globally, employees can receive up to\neight hours of additional paid time off for\nCOVID-19 vaccine appointments. Early in the\npandemic, we adjusted our child care benefits\nin the U.S. and Canada to provide additional\nresources and flexibility for employees\nimpacted by school closures. We also enhanced\nour health care and time-off benefits in the\nU.S. to help cover medical costs associated\nwith COVID-19 and allow high-risk, exposed, or\ninfected employees to stay home without having\nto take paid time off. Employees have access\nto a range of other resources through our\ninternal COVID-19 resource center. Promoting\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion. Meeting the\nincreasingly diverse needs of Wells Fargo\u2019s\nglobal customer base is critical to our\ncompany\u2019s long-term growth and success. Wells\nFargo values and promotes diversity, equity\nand inclusion (DE&I) in every aspect of our\nbusiness. We are dedicated to recruitment and\ncareer development practices that support our\nemployees and promote diversity in our\nworkforce at all levels of our Company,\nincluding leadership positions. We have a\nstrong record of recruiting, promoting, and\nrewarding women and racially/ethnically\ndiverse employees at all levels of our\nCompany, including a commitment to increase\ndiverse representation in leadership roles. In\nNovember 2020, a new Operating Committee-level\nrole reporting directly to our CEO was created\nto lead DE&I efforts. In this role, our Head\nof Diverse Segments, Representation and\nInclusion is responsible for driving a\nCompany-wide DE&I strategy. Pay Equity Review.\nWells Fargo is committed to fair and equitable\ncompensation practices, and we regularly\nreview our compensation programs and practices\nfor pay equity. Each year, we engage a third-\nparty consultant to conduct a thorough pay\nequity review of employee compensation, which\nconsiders gender, race, and ethnicity. The\nresults of our 2021 review, after accounting\nfor factors such as role, tenure, and\ngeography, show that women at Wells Fargo\ncontinued to earn more than 99 cents for every\n$1 earned by their male peers. In addition,\nour U.S. employees who are racially/ethnically\ndiverse continued to earn more than 99 cents\nfor every $1 earned by Caucasian/white\n                      1                       \npeers. These results\nhave remained\nconsistent since we\nstarted publishing the\nresults of our pay\nequity review in 2017.\n\nEmployee training and\ndevelopment. We invest\nheavily in coaching\nand training for\nemployees and\nmanagers. We believe\nthat when our\nemployees feel\nproperly supported,\nengaged, and confident\nin their skills, they\nare more effective and\ncan provide an even\nbetter customer\nexperience. During\n2021, we invested\napproximately $200\nmillion in a variety\nof employee learning\nand development\nprograms, including\nfunctional training,\nregulatory compliance,\nleadership and\nprofessional\ndevelopment, early\ntalent development\nprograms, and tuition\nreimbursement.\n\nCompensation and\nbenefits. We value and\nsupport our people as\na competitive\nadvantage. We provide\nall eligible full- and\npart-time employees\n(and their eligible\ndependents, as\napplicable) with a\ncomprehensive set of\nbenefits designed to\nprotect their physical\nand financial health\nand to help them make\nthe most of their\nfinancial future.\n                                              \n  Competition                                 \n                                              \nThe financial services\nindustry is highly\ncompetitive. Our\nsubsidiaries compete\nwith financial\nservices providers\nsuch as banks, savings\nand loan associations,\ncredit unions, finance\ncompanies, mortgage\nbanking companies,\ninsurance companies,\ninvestment banks and\nmutual fund companies.\nThey also face\nincreased competition\nfrom nonbank\ninstitutions such as\nbrokerage houses,\nprivate equity firms\nand online lending\ncompanies, as well as\nfrom financial\nservices subsidiaries\nof commercial and\nmanufacturing\ncompanies. Many of\nthese competitors\nenjoy fewer regulatory\nconstraints and some\nmay have lower cost\nstructures.\n\nSecurities firms and\ninsurance companies\nthat elect to become\nfinancial holding\ncompanies may acquire\nbanks and other\nfinancial\ninstitutions.\nCombinations of this\ntype could\nsignificantly change\nthe competitive\nenvironment in which\nwe conduct business.\nThe financial services\nindustry is also\nlikely to become more\ncompetitive as further\ntechnological advances\nenable more companies\nto provide financial\nservices. These\ntechnological advances\nmay diminish the\nimportance of\ndepository\ninstitutions and other\nfinancial\nintermediaries in the\ntransfer of funds\nbetween parties.\n                                              \n   REGULATION AND SUPERVISION                 \n                                              \nWe describe below, and\nin Note 28 (Regulatory\nCapital Requirements\nand Other\nRestrictions) to\nFinancial Statements\nincluded in the 2021\nAnnual Report to\nShareholders, the\nmaterial elements of\nthe regulatory\nframework applicable\nto us. Banking\nstatutes, regulations\nand policies are\ncontinually under\nreview by Congress and\nstate legislatures and\nfederal and state\nregulatory agencies,\nas well as non-U.S.\ngovernments and\nfinancial regulators,\nand a change in them,\nincluding changes in\nhow they are\ninterpreted or\nimplemented, could\nhave a material effect\non our business. The\nregulatory framework\napplicable to\ndepository\ninstitutions and bank\nholding companies\n(BHCs) is intended to\nprotect depositors,\nfederal deposit\ninsurance funds,\nconsumers and the\nbanking system as a\nwhole, and not\nnecessarily investors\nin bank holding\ncompanies such as the\nCompany.\n\nStatutes, regulations\nand policies could\nrestrict our ability\nto diversify into\nother areas of\nfinancial services,\nmake acquisitions, and\npay dividends on our\ncapital stock. They\nmay also require us to\nprovide financial\nsupport to one or more\nof our subsidiary\nbanks, maintain\ncapital balances in\nexcess of amounts\ndesired by management,\nand pay higher deposit\ninsurance premiums as\na\n\nresult of a general\ndeterioration in the\nfinancial condition of\ndepository\ninstitutions. See the\n\u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d\nand \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nsections in the 2021\nAnnual Report to\nShareholders for\nadditional\ninformation.\n                                              \n  General                                     \n                                              \nParent Bank Holding\nCompany. As a BHC, the\nParent is subject to\nregulation under the\nBHC Act and to\ninspection,\nexamination and\nsupervision by its\nprimary regulator, the\nBoard of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve\nSystem (Federal\nReserve Board or FRB).\nThe Parent is also\nsubject to the\ndisclosure and\nregulatory\nrequirements of the\nSecurities Act of\n1933, as amended, and\nthe Securities\nExchange Act of 1934,\nas amended, both as\nadministered by the\nSEC. As a company with\nsecurities listed on\nthe New York Stock\nExchange (NYSE), the\nParent is subject to\nthe rules of the NYSE\nfor listed companies.\n\nSubsidiary Banks. Our\nsubsidiary national\nbanks, and their\nsubsidiaries, are\nsubject to regulation\nand examination\nprimarily by the\nOffice of the\nComptroller of the\nCurrency (OCC) and\nalso by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC),\nthe FRB, the Consumer\nFinancial Protection\nBureau (CFPB), the SEC\nand the Commodities\nFutures Trading\nCommission (CFTC). The\nnon-U.S. branches and\nrepresentative offices\nof our subsidiary\nnational banks are\nsubject to regulation\nand examination by\ntheir respective\nfinancial regulators\nas well as by the OCC\nand the FRB. Non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries of our\nnational bank\nsubsidiaries may be\nsubject to the laws\nand regulations of the\ncountries in which\nthey conduct business.\n\nNonbank Subsidiaries.\nMany of our nonbank\nsubsidiaries are also\nsubject to regulation\nby the FRB and other\napplicable federal and\nstate agencies. Our\ninsurance subsidiaries\nare subject to\nregulation by\napplicable state\ninsurance regulatory\nagencies, as well as\nthe FRB. Our brokerage\nsubsidiaries are\nregulated by the SEC,\nthe Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority\n(FINRA) and, in some\ncases, the CFTC and\nthe Municipal\nSecurities Rulemaking\nBoard, and state\nsecurities regulators.\nOur other nonbank\nsubsidiaries may be\nsubject to the laws\nand regulations of the\nfederal government\nand/or the various\nstates as well as\nnon-U.S. countries in\nwhich they conduct\nbusiness.\n                                              \n  Parent Bank Holding Company Activities      \n                                              \n\u201cFinancial in Nature\u201d\nRequirement. We became\na financial holding\ncompany effective\nMarch 13, 2000. We\ncontinue to maintain\nour status as a BHC\nfor purposes of\nvarious FRB\nregulations. As a BHC\nthat has elected to be\ntreated as a financial\nholding company\npursuant to the BHC\nAct, we may affiliate\nwith securities firms\nand insurance\ncompanies and engage\nin other activities\nthat are financial in\nnature or incidental\nor complementary to\nactivities that are\nfinancial in nature.\n\u201cFinancial in nature\u201d\nactivities include\nsecurities\nunderwriting, dealing\nand market making;\nsponsoring mutual\nfunds and investment\ncompanies; insurance\nunderwriting and\nagency; merchant\nbanking; and\nactivities that the\nFRB, in consultation\nwith the Secretary of\nthe U.S. Treasury,\ndetermines to be\nfinancial in nature or\nincidental to such\nfinancial activity.\n\u201cComplementary\nactivities\u201d are\nactivities that the\nFRB determines upon\napplication to be\ncomplementary to a\nfinancial activity and\ndo not pose a safety\nand soundness risk.\n\nFRB approval is\ngenerally not required\nfor us to acquire a\ncompany (other than a\nBHC, bank or savings\nassociation) engaged\nin activities that are\nfinancial in nature or\nincidental to\nactivities that are\nfinancial in nature,\nas determined by the\nFRB. Prior notice to\nthe FRB may be\nrequired, however, if\nthe company\n                      2                       \nto be acquired has\ntotal consolidated\nassets of $10 billion\nor more. Prior FRB\napproval is required\nbefore we may acquire\nthe beneficial\nownership or control\nof more than 5% of the\nvoting shares or\nsubstantially all of\nthe assets of a BHC,\nbank or savings\nassociation. In\naddition, the FRB has\nimplemented a final\nrule under the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer\nProtection Act (Dodd-\nFrank Act) that also\nprohibits our ability\nto merge, acquire all\nor substantially all\nof the assets of, or\nacquire control of\nanother company if our\ntotal resulting\nconsolidated\nliabilities would\nexceed 10% of the\naggregate consolidated\nliabilities of all\nfinancial companies.\n\nBecause we are a\nfinancial holding\ncompany, if any of our\nsubsidiary banks\nreceives a rating\nunder the Community\nReinvestment Act of\n1977, as amended\n(CRA), of less than\nsatisfactory, we will\nbe prohibited, until\nthe rating is raised\nto satisfactory or\nbetter, from engaging\nin new activities or\nacquiring companies\nother than BHCs, banks\nor savings\nassociations, except\nthat we could engage\nin new activities, or\nacquire companies\nengaged in activities,\nthat are closely\nrelated to banking\nunder the BHC Act. CRA\nperformance is also\ntaken into account by\nregulators in\nreviewing applications\nto establish bank\nbranches. In addition,\nif the FRB finds that\nthe Company or any one\nof our subsidiary\nbanks is not well\ncapitalized or well\nmanaged, we would be\nrequired to enter into\nan agreement with the\nFRB to comply with all\napplicable capital and\nmanagement\nrequirements and which\nmay contain additional\nlimitations or\nconditions. Until\ncorrected, we could be\nprohibited from\nengaging in any new\nactivity or acquiring\ncompanies engaged in\nactivities that are\nnot closely related to\nbanking under the BHC\nAct without prior FRB\napproval. If we fail\nto correct any such\ncondition within a\nprescribed period, the\nFRB could order us to\ndivest our banking\nsubsidiaries or, in\nthe alternative, to\ncease engaging in\nactivities other than\nthose closely related\nto banking under the\nBHC Act.\n\nInterstate Banking .\nUnder the Riegle-Neal\nInterstate Banking and\nBranching Act (Riegle-\nNeal Act), a BHC may\nacquire banks in\nstates other than its\nhome state, subject to\nany state requirement\nthat the bank has been\norganized and\noperating for a\nminimum period of\ntime, not to exceed\nfive years, and the\nrequirement that the\nBHC not control, prior\nto or following the\nproposed acquisition,\nmore than 10% of the\ntotal amount of\ndeposits of insured\ndepository\ninstitutions\nnationwide or, unless\nthe acquisition is the\nbank holding company\u2019s\ninitial entry into the\nstate, more than 30%\nof such deposits in\nthe state (or such\nlesser or greater\namount set by the\nstate). The Riegle-\nNeal Act also\nauthorizes banks to\nmerge across state\nlines, subject to the\nsame deposit limits\nnoted above, thereby\ncreating interstate\nbranches. Banks are\nalso permitted to\nacquire and to\nestablish new branches\nin other states.\n\nRegulatory Approval.\nIn determining whether\nto approve a proposed\nbank acquisition,\nfederal banking\nregulators will\nconsider, among other\nfactors, the effect of\nthe acquisition on\ncompetition, financial\ncondition, and future\nprospects including\ncurrent and projected\ncapital ratios and\nlevels, the\ncompetence,\nexperience, and\nintegrity of\nmanagement and record\nof compliance with\nlaws and regulations,\nthe convenience and\nneeds of the\ncommunities to be\nserved, including the\nacquiring\ninstitution\u2019s record\nof compliance under\nthe CRA, the\neffectiveness of the\nacquiring institution\nin combating money\nlaundering activities\nand the risk to the\nstability of the\nUnited States banking\nsystem.\n                                              \n  Dividend Restrictions                       \n                                              \nThe Parent is a legal\nentity separate and\ndistinct from its\nsubsidiary banks and\nother subsidiaries. A\nsignificant source of\nfunds to pay dividends\non our common and\npreferred stock and\nprincipal and interest\non our debt is\ndividends from the\nParent\u2019s subsidiaries.\nVarious federal and\nstate statutory\nprovisions and\nregulations limit the\namount of dividends\nthe Parent\u2019s\nsubsidiary banks and\ncertain other\nsubsidiaries may pay\nwithout regulatory\napproval. Federal\nbanking regulators\nhave the authority to\nprohibit the Parent\u2019s\nsubsidiary banks from\nengaging in unsafe or\nunsound practices in\nconducting their\nbusinesses. The\npayment of dividends,\ndepending on the\nfinancial condition of\nthe bank in question,\ncould be deemed an\nunsafe or unsound\npractice. The ability\nof the Parent\u2019s\nsubsidiary banks to\npay dividends in the\nfuture is currently,\nand could be further,\ninfluenced by bank\nregulatory policies\nand capital\nrequirements. For\ninformation about the\nrestrictions\napplicable to the\nParent\u2019s subsidiary\nbanks, see Note 28\n(Regulatory Capital\nRequirements and Other\nRestrictions) to\nFinancial Statements\nincluded in the 2021\nAnnual Report to\nShareholders.\n\nFurthermore, under a\nSupport Agreement\ndated June 28, 2017,\nas amended and\nrestated on June 26,\n2019 (the \u201cSupport\nAgreement\u201d), among the\nParent, WFC Holdings,\nLLC, an intermediate\nholding company and\nsubsidiary of the\nParent (the \u201cIHC\u201d),\nWells Fargo Bank,\nN.A., Wells Fargo\nSecurities, LLC, Wells\nFargo Clearing\nServices, LLC, and\ncertain other\nsubsidiaries of the\nParent designated from\ntime to time as\nmaterial entities for\nresolution planning\npurposes or identified\nfrom time to time as\nrelated support\nentities in our\nresolution plan, the\nIHC may be restricted\nfrom making dividend\npayments to the Parent\nif certain liquidity\nand/or capital metrics\nfall below defined\ntriggers, or if the\nParent\u2019s board of\ndirectors authorizes\nit to file a case\nunder the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code. Any\nsuch restriction could\nmaterially and\nadversely impact the\nParent\u2019s liquidity and\nits ability to satisfy\nits debt and other\nobligations, as well\nas its ability to make\ndividend payments on\nits common and\npreferred stock. See\nthe \u201cRegulatory\nMatters\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d sections of\nthe 2021 Annual Report\nto Shareholders for\nadditional information\non the Support\nAgreement.\n\nIn addition to these\nrestrictions on the\nability of our\nsubsidiary banks to\npay dividends to us,\nthe FRB requires large\nBHCs, including Wells\nFargo, to submit\nannual capital plans\ndescribing planned\ncapital distributions,\nsuch as the payment of\ndividends. The FRB\nalso finalized rules\nimplementing in the\nUnited States the\nBasel Committee on\nBanking Supervision\u2019s\nregulatory capital\nrules, including the\nreforms known as Basel\nIII, which established\nvarious capital\nrequirements for U.S.\nbanking organizations.\nMoreover, federal\nbanking regulators\nhave finalized rules\nthat require leverage\nand supplementary\nleverage ratio\nrequirements for large\nBHCs, like Wells\nFargo, and their\ninsured depository\ninstitutions. We are\nalso subject to the\nFRB's rule\nimplementing an\nadditional capital\nsurcharge on those\nU.S. banking\norganizations, such as\nthe Company, that are\ndesignated as global\nsystemically important\nbanks (G-SIBs). The\nfailure to meet any of\nthese requirements\ncould result in\nlimitations or\nrestrictions on our\nability to make\ncapital distributions.\n\nIn addition, the FRB\u2019s\nenhanced supervision\nregulations for large\nBHCs, like Wells\nFargo, impose capital\ndistribution\nrestrictions,\nincluding on the\npayment of dividends,\nupon the occurrence of\ncapital, stress test,\nrisk management, or\nliquidity risk\nmanagement triggers.\nFor more information\non regulations or\narrangements that may\nimpose capital\ndistribution\nrestrictions on the\nCompany and its\nsubsidiaries, see the\n\u201cCapital Management,\u201d\n\u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d\nand \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nsections of the 2021\nAnnual Report to\nShareholders.\n                      3                       \n                                              \n  Holding Company Structure                   \n                                              \nTransfer of Funds from\nSubsidiary Banks. The\nParent\u2019s subsidiary\nbanks are subject to\nrestrictions under\nfederal law that limit\nthe transfer of funds\nor other assets from\nsuch subsidiaries to\nthe Parent and its\nnonbank subsidiaries\n(including affiliates)\nin so-called \u201ccovered\ntransactions.\u201d In\ngeneral, covered\ntransactions include\nloans and other\nextensions of credit,\ninvestments and asset\npurchases, as well as\ncertain other\ntransactions involving\nthe transfer of value\nfrom a subsidiary bank\nto an affiliate or for\nthe benefit of an\naffiliate. Unless an\nexemption applies,\ncovered transactions\nby a subsidiary bank\nwith a single\naffiliate are limited\nto 10% of the\nsubsidiary bank\u2019s\ncapital and surplus\nand, with respect to\nall covered\ntransactions with\naffiliates in the\naggregate, to 20% of\nthe subsidiary bank\u2019s\ncapital and surplus.\nAlso, loans and\nextensions of credit\nto affiliates\ngenerally must be\nsecured by qualifying\ncollateral. A bank\u2019s\ntransactions with its\nnonbank affiliates are\nalso generally\nrequired to be on\narm\u2019s length terms.\nThe Company is also\nsubject to lending\nlimits and qualitative\nrequirements on loans\nto executive officers,\ndirectors and\nprincipal shareholders\nof the Parent and its\nsubsidiary banks.\n\nSource of Strength.\nThe FRB has a policy\nthat a BHC is expected\nto act as a source of\nfinancial and\nmanagerial strength to\neach of its subsidiary\nbanks and, under\nappropriate\ncircumstances, to\ncommit resources to\nsupport each such\nsubsidiary bank. This\nsupport may be\nrequired at times when\nthe BHC may not have\nthe resources to\nprovide the support.\n\nThe OCC may order an\nassessment of the\nParent if the capital\nof one of its national\nbank subsidiaries were\nto become impaired. If\nthe Parent failed to\npay the assessment\nwithin three months,\nthe OCC could order\nthe sale of the\nParent\u2019s stock in the\nnational bank to cover\nthe deficiency.\n\nDepositor Preference.\nIn the event of the\n\u201cliquidation or other\nresolution\u201d of an\ninsured depository\ninstitution, the\nclaims of deposits\npayable in the United\nStates (including the\nclaims of the FDIC as\nsubrogee of insured\ndepositors) and\ncertain claims for\nadministrative\nexpenses of the FDIC\nas a receiver will\nhave priority over\nother general\nunsecured claims\nagainst the\ninstitution. If an\ninsured depository\ninstitution fails,\nclaims of insured and\nuninsured U.S.\ndepositors, along with\nclaims of the FDIC,\nwill have priority in\npayment ahead of\nunsecured creditors,\nincluding the Parent,\nand depositors whose\ndeposits are solely\npayable at such\ninsured depository\ninstitution\u2019s non-U.S.\noffices.\n\nLiability of Commonly\nControlled\nInstitutions. The\nCompany\u2019s subsidiaries\ninclude banks in the\nU.S., such as Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A., that\nare insured by the\nFDIC. FDIC-insured\ndepository\ninstitutions can be\nheld liable for any\nloss incurred, or\nreasonably expected to\nbe incurred, by the\nFDIC due to the\ndefault of an FDIC-\ninsured depository\ninstitution controlled\nby the same BHC, and\nfor any assistance\nprovided by the FDIC\nto an FDIC-insured\ndepository institution\nthat is in danger of\ndefault and that is\ncontrolled by the same\nBHC. \u201cDefault\u201d means\ngenerally the\nappointment of a\nconservator or\nreceiver. \u201cIn danger\nof default\u201d means\ngenerally the\nexistence of certain\nconditions indicating\nthat a default is\nlikely to occur in the\nabsence of regulatory\nassistance.\n                                              \n  Dodd-Frank Act                              \n                                              \nThe Dodd-Frank Act and\nthe numerous rules to\nimplement its\nprovisions have\nresulted in enhanced\nregulation and\nsupervision of large\nBHCs, such as Wells\nFargo. This includes,\namong other things,\nrules to promote\nfinancial stability\nand prevent or\nmitigate the risks\nthat may arise from\nthe material distress\nor\n\nfailure of a large\nBHC; enhance consumer\nprotections; prohibit\nproprietary trading;\nand implement enhanced\nprudential\nrequirements for large\nBHCs regarding risk-\nbased capital and\nleverage, risk and\nliquidity management,\nstress testing, and\nrecovery and\nresolution planning.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act,\nincluding current and\nfuture rules\nimplementing its\nprovisions and the\ninterpretation of\nthose rules, has\naffected, and we\nexpect will continue\nto affect, most of our\nbusinesses in some\nway, either directly\nthrough regulation of\nspecific activities or\nindirectly through\nregulation of\nconcentration risks,\ncapital or liquidity.\nFor more information\nabout the Dodd-Frank\nAct and its effect on\nour business, see the\n\u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d\nand \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nsections of the 2021\nAnnual Report to\nShareholders.\n\nCapital and Liquidity\nRequirements and\nCapital Planning\n\nThe Company and each\nof our insured\ndepository\ninstitutions are\nsubject to various\nregulatory capital\nadequacy and liquidity\nrequirements\nadministered by\nfederal banking\nregulators. The\ncapital rules, among\nother things,\nestablish required\nminimum ratios\nrelating capital to\ndifferent categories\nof assets and\nexposures. Federal\nbanking regulators\nhave also finalized\nrules to impose a\nleverage and\nsupplementary leverage\nratio on large BHCs,\nlike Wells Fargo, and\ntheir insured\ndepository\ninstitutions, and to\nimplement a liquidity\ncoverage ratio and a\nnet stable funding\nratio. The FRB has\nalso finalized rules\nto address the amount\nof equity and\nunsecured long-term\ndebt a G-SIB must hold\nto improve its\nresolvability and\nresiliency, often\nreferred to as total\nloss absorbing\ncapacity.\n\nFrom time to time,\nfederal banking\nregulators propose\nchanges and amendments\nto, and issue\ninterpretations of,\nrisk-based capital\nrequirements and\nrelated reporting\ninstructions. In\naddition, the FRB\nclosely monitors\ncapital levels of the\ninstitutions it\nsupervises and may\nrequire such\ninstitutions to modify\ncapital levels based\non FRB determinations.\nSuch determinations,\nproposals or\ninterpretations could,\nif implemented in the\nfuture, affect our\nreported capital\nratios and net risk-\nadjusted assets.\n\nAs an additional means\nto identify problems\nin the financial\nmanagement of\ndepository\ninstitutions, the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Act (FDI\nAct) requires federal\nbanking regulators to\nestablish certain non-\ncapital safety and\nsoundness standards\nfor institutions for\nwhich they are the\nprimary federal\nregulator. The\nstandards relate\ngenerally to\noperations and\nmanagement, asset\nquality, interest rate\nexposure, executive\ncompensation and risk\nmanagement. Federal\nbanking regulators are\nauthorized to take\naction against\ninstitutions that fail\nto meet such\nstandards.\n\nThe FDI Act requires\nfederal banking\nregulators to take\n\u201cprompt corrective\naction\u201d with respect\nto FDIC-insured\ndepository\ninstitutions that do\nnot meet minimum\ncapital requirements.\nA depository\ninstitution\u2019s\ntreatment for purposes\nof the prompt\ncorrective action\nprovisions will depend\nupon how its capital\nlevels compare to\nvarious capital\nmeasures and certain\nother factors, as\nestablished by\nregulation.\n\nIn addition, the FRB\u2019s\ncapital plan rule\nestablishes capital\nplanning and other\nrequirements that\ngovern capital\ndistributions,\nincluding dividends\nand share repurchases,\nby certain BHCs,\nincluding Wells Fargo.\nFederal banking\nregulators also\nrequire stress tests\nto evaluate whether an\ninstitution has\nsufficient capital to\ncontinue to operate\nduring periods of\nadverse economic and\nfinancial conditions.\n\nFor more information\non our capital\nrequirements and\nplanning, see the\n\u201cCapital Management\u201d\nsection of the 2021\nAnnual Report to\nShareholders.\n                      4                       \nDeposit Insurance\nAssessments The\nCompany\u2019s subsidiaries\ninclude banks, such as\nWells Fargo Bank,\nN.A., that are members\nof the Deposit\nInsurance Fund (DIF)\nmaintained by the\nFDIC. Through the DIF,\nthe FDIC insures the\ndeposits of our\ninsured banks up to\nprescribed limits for\neach depositor and\nfunds the DIF through\nassessments on member\nbanks. To maintain the\nDIF, member\ninstitutions are\nassessed an insurance\npremium based on an\nassessment base and an\nassessment rate. The\nFDIC has adopted a\ncomprehensive, long-\nrange plan for DIF\nmanagement, targeting\na designated reserve\nratio of 2%. For the\nyear ended December\n31, 2021, the\nCompany's FDIC deposit\ninsurance assessments\ntotaled $666 million.\nThe FDIC may terminate\na depository\ninstitution\u2019s deposit\ninsurance upon a\nfinding that the\ninstitution\u2019s\nfinancial condition is\nunsafe or unsound or\nthat the institution\nor its directors have\nengaged in unsafe or\nunsound practices or\nhave violated any\napplicable law,\nregulation, order or\ncondition enacted or\nimposed by the\ninstitution\u2019s\nregulatory agency. The\ntermination of deposit\ninsurance for one or\nmore of our bank\nsubsidiaries could\nhave a material\nadverse effect on our\nearnings, depending on\nthe collective size of\nthe particular banks\ninvolved. Fiscal and\nMonetary Policies Our\nbusiness and earnings\nare affected\nsignificantly by the\nfiscal and monetary\npolicies of the\nfederal government and\nits agencies. We are\nparticularly affected\nby the monetary\npolicies of the FRB,\nwhich regulates the\nsupply of money and\ncredit in the United\nStates. Among the\ninstruments of\nmonetary policy\navailable to the FRB\nare (a) conducting\nopen market operations\nin United States\ngovernment securities,\n(b) changing the\ndiscount rates of\nborrowings of\ndepository\ninstitutions, (c)\nimposing or changing\nreserve requirements\nagainst depository\ninstitutions\u2019\ndeposits, and (d)\nimposing or changing\nreserve requirements\nagainst certain\nborrowings by banks\nand their affiliates.\nThese methods are used\nin varying degrees and\ncombinations to\ndirectly affect the\navailability of bank\nloans and deposits, as\nwell as the interest\nrates charged on loans\nand paid on deposits.\nThe policies of the\nFRB may have a\nmaterial effect on our\nbusiness, results of\noperations and\nfinancial condition.\nPrivacy Provisions of\nthe Gramm-Leach-Bliley\nAct and Restrictions\non Affiliate Marketing\nFederal banking\nregulators, as\nrequired under the\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act\n(the GLB Act), have\nadopted rules limiting\nthe ability of banks\nand other financial\ninstitutions to\ndisclose nonpublic\ninformation about\nconsumers to\nnonaffiliated third\nparties. The rules\nrequire disclosure of\nprivacy policies to\nconsumers and, in some\ncircumstances, allow\nconsumers to prevent\ndisclosure of certain\npersonal information\nto nonaffiliated third\nparties. The privacy\nprovisions of the GLB\nAct affect how\nconsumer information\nis transmitted through\ndiversified financial\nservices companies and\nconveyed to outside\nvendors. Federal\nfinancial regulators\nhave issued\nregulations under the\nFair and Accurate\nCredit Transactions\nAct that have the\neffect of increasing\nthe length of the\nwaiting period, after\nprivacy disclosures\nare provided to new\ncustomers, before\ninformation can be\nshared among different\naffiliated companies\nfor the purpose of\nmarketing products and\nservices by those\naffiliated companies.\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002 The Sarbanes-\nOxley Act of 2002\n(Sarbanes-Oxley)\nimplemented a broad\nrange of corporate\ngovernance and\naccounting measures to\nincrease corporate\nresponsibility, to\nprovide for enhanced\npenalties for\naccounting and\nauditing improprieties\nat publicly\n\ntraded companies, and\nto protect investors\nby improving the\naccuracy and\nreliability of\ndisclosures under\nfederal securities\nlaws. We are subject\nto Sarbanes-Oxley\nbecause we are\nrequired to file\nperiodic reports with\nthe SEC under the\nSecurities Exchange\nAct of 1934. Among\nother things,\nSarbanes-Oxley and/or\nits implementing\nregulations\nestablished membership\nrequirements and\nadditional\nresponsibilities for\nour audit committee,\nimposed restrictions\non the relationship\nbetween us and our\noutside auditors\n(including\nrestrictions on the\ntypes of non-audit\nservices our auditors\nmay provide to us),\nimposed additional\nresponsibilities for\nour external financial\nstatements on our\nchief executive\nofficer and chief\nfinancial officer,\nexpanded the\ndisclosure\nrequirements for our\ncorporate insiders,\nrequired our\nmanagement to evaluate\nour disclosure\ncontrols and\nprocedures and our\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting,\nand required our\nindependent registered\npublic accounting firm\nto issue a report on\nour internal control\nover financial\nreporting. Patriot Act\nThe Uniting and\nStrengthening America\nby Providing\nAppropriate Tools\nRequired to Intercept\nand Obstruct Terrorism\nAct of 2001 (Patriot\nAct) is intended to\nstrengthen the ability\nof U.S. law\nenforcement agencies\nand intelligence\ncommunities to work\ntogether to combat\nterrorism on a variety\nof fronts. The Patriot\nAct has significant\nimplications for\ndepository\ninstitutions, brokers,\ndealers and other\nbusinesses involved in\nthe transfer of money.\nThe Patriot Act\nrequires the\nimplementation of\npolicies and\nprocedures relating to\nanti\u2011money laundering,\ncompliance, suspicious\nactivities, and\ncurrency transaction\nreporting and due\ndiligence on\ncustomers. The Patriot\nAct also requires\nfederal banking\nregulators to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of\nan applicant in\ncombating money\nlaundering in\ndetermining whether to\napprove a proposed\nbank acquisition.\nFuture Legislation or\nRegulation Economic,\nmarket and political\nconditions during the\npast several years\nhave led to a\nsignificant amount of\nlegislation and\nregulation in the U.S.\nand abroad affecting\nthe financial services\nindustry, as well as\nheightened\nexpectations and\nscrutiny of financial\nservices companies\nfrom banking\nregulators. Further\nlegislative changes\nand additional\nregulations may change\nour operating\nenvironment in\nsubstantial and\nunpredictable ways.\nSuch legislation and\nregulations could\nincrease our cost of\ndoing business, affect\nour compensation\nstructure, restrict or\nexpand the activities\nin which we may engage\nor affect the\ncompetitive balance\namong banks, savings\nassociations, credit\nunions, and other\nfinancial\ninstitutions. We\ncannot predict whether\nfuture legislative\nproposals will be\nenacted and, if\nenacted, the effect\nthat they, or any\nimplementing\nregulations, would\nhave on our business,\nresults of operations\nor financial\ncondition.

At December 31, 2021, we had\nremaining Board authority to repurchase\napproximately 361 million shares of common\nstock, subject to regulatory and legal\nconditions. The authorizations cover shares\nrepurchased to meet employee benefit plan\nrequirements. The Company maintains a variety\nof retirement plans for its employees and\ntypically is a net issuer of shares of common\nstock to these plans. From time to time, it\nalso purchases shares of common stock from\nthese plans to accommodate employee\npreferences. Share repurchases are subtracted\nfrom the Company\u2019s repurchase authority\nwithout offset for share issuances. Shares may\nbe repurchased as part of employee stock\noption exercises, from the different benefit\nplans or in the open market, subject to\nregulatory approval. The amount and timing of\nstock repurchases will be based on various\nfactors, including our capital requirements,\nthe number of shares we expect to issue for\nemployee benefit plans and acquisitions,\nmarket conditions (including the trading price\nof our stock), and regulatory and legal\nconsiderations. See the \u201cCapital Management\u201d\nsection in the 2021 Annual Report to\nShareholders for additional information about\nour common stock repurchases.
