Prior period risk-based\ncapital and certain other regulatory related\nmetrics were not revised. For additional\ninformation, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) to Financial\nStatements in this Report.\n\n(2) Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is\ntotal revenue less noninterest expense.\nManagement believes that PTPP is a useful\nfinancial measure because it enables investors\nand others to assess the Company\u2019s ability to\ngenerate capital to cover credit losses\nthrough a credit cycle.\n\n(3) For the nine months ended September 30,\n2020, diluted average common shares\noutstanding equaled average common shares\noutstanding because our securities convertible\ninto common shares had an anti-dilutive\neffect.\n\n(4) Book value per common share is common\nstockholders' equity divided by common shares\noutstanding. Tangible book value per common\nshare is tangible common equity divided by\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\n(5) Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure and represents total equity\nless preferred equity, noncontrolling\ninterests, goodwill, certain identifiable\nintangible assets (other than mortgage\nservicing rights) and goodwill and other\nintangibles on nonmarketable equity\nsecurities, net of applicable deferred taxes.\nThe methodology of determining tangible common\nequity may differ among companies. Management\nbelieves that return on average tangible\ncommon equity and tangible book value per\ncommon share, which utilize tangible common\nequity, are useful financial measures because\nthey enable management, investors, and others\nto assess the Company\u2019s use of equity. For\nadditional information, including a\ncorresponding reconciliation to generally\naccepted accounting principles (GAAP)\nfinancial measures, see the \u201cCapital\nManagement \u2013 Tangible Common Equity\u201d section\nin this Report.\n\n(6) Represents Wells Fargo net income divided\nby average assets.\n\n(7) Represents Wells Fargo net income (loss)\napplicable to common stock divided by average\ncommon stockholders\u2019 equity.\n\n(8) The efficiency ratio is noninterest\nexpense divided by total revenue (net interest\nincome and noninterest income).\n\n(9) The information presented reflects fully\nphased-in CET1, tier 1 capital, and RWAs, but\nreflects total capital in accordance with\ntransition requirements.

Issues\nor delays with one\nregulatory action\ncould affect our\nprogress on others,\nand failure to satisfy\nthe requirements of a\nregulatory action on a\ntimely basis could\nresult in additional\npenalties, enforcement\nactions, and other\nnegative consequences.\nWhile we still have\nsignificant work to\ndo, the Company is\ncommitted to devoting\nthe resources\nnecessary to operate\nwith strong business\npractices and\ncontrols, maintain the\nhighest level of\nintegrity, and have an\nappropriate culture in\nplace.\n\nFederal Reserve Board\nConsent Order\nRegarding Governance\nOversight and\nCompliance and\nOperational Risk\nManagement\n\nOn February 2, 2018,\nthe Company entered\ninto a consent order\nwith the Board of\nGovernors of the\nFederal Reserve System\n(FRB).

The\nconsent order also\nrequires the Company,\nfollowing the FRB\u2019s\nacceptance and\napproval of the plans\nand the Company\u2019s\nadoption and\nimplementation of the\nplans, to complete an\ninitial third-party\nreview of the\nenhancements and\nimprovements provided\nfor in the plans.\nUntil this third-party\nreview is complete and\nthe plans are approved\nand implemented to the\nsatisfaction\n\nof the FRB, the\nCompany\u2019s total\nconsolidated assets as\ndefined under the\nconsent order will be\nlimited to the level\nas of December 31,\n2017. Compliance with\nthis asset cap is\nmeasured on a two-\nquarter daily average\nbasis to allow for\nmanagement of\ntemporary\nfluctuations. Due to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic,\non April 8, 2020, the\nFRB amended the\nconsent order to allow\nthe Company to exclude\nfrom the asset cap any\non-balance sheet\nexposure resulting\nfrom loans made by the\nCompany in connection\nwith the Small\nBusiness\nAdministration\u2019s\nPaycheck Protection\nProgram and the FRB\u2019s\nMain Street Lending\nProgram.

As of\nSeptember 30, 2021,\nthe Company had not\nexcluded these\nexposures from the\nasset cap. After\nremoval of the asset\ncap, a second third-\nparty review must also\nbe conducted to assess\nthe efficacy and\nsustainability of the\nenhancements and\nimprovements.\n\nConsent Orders with\nthe Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau and\nOffice of the\nComptroller of the\nCurrency Regarding\nCompliance Risk\nManagement Program,\nAutomobile Collateral\nProtection Insurance\nPolicies, and Mortgage\nInterest Rate Lock\nExtensions\n\nOn April 20, 2018, the\nCompany entered into\nconsent orders with\nthe Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau\n(CFPB) and the Office\nof the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (OCC) to\npay an aggregate of $1\nbillion in civil money\npenalties to resolve\nmatters regarding the\nCompany\u2019s compliance\nrisk management\nprogram and past\npractices involving\ncertain automobile\ncollateral protection\ninsurance (CPI)\npolicies and certain\nmortgage interest rate\nlock extensions. As\nrequired by the\nconsent orders, the\nCompany submitted to\nthe CFPB and OCC an\nenterprise-wide\ncompliance risk\nmanagement plan and a\nplan to enhance the\nCompany\u2019s internal\naudit program with\nrespect to federal\nconsumer financial law\nand the terms of the\nconsent orders.

We define our\nreportable operating\nsegments by type of\nproduct and customer\nsegment, and their\nresults are based on\nour management\nreporting process. The\nmanagement reporting\nprocess measures the\nperformance of the\nreportable operating\nsegments based on the\nCompany\u2019s management\nstructure, and the\nresults are regularly\nreviewed by our Chief\nExecutive Officer and\nOperating Committee.\nThe management\nreporting process is\nbased on U.S. GAAP and\nincludes specific\nadjustments, such as\nfunds transfer pricing\nfor asset/liability\nmanagement, shared\nrevenues and expenses,\nand taxable-equivalent\nadjustments to\nconsistently reflect\nincome from taxable\nand tax-exempt\nsources, which allows\nmanagement to assess\nperformance\nconsistently across\nthe operating\nsegments.\n\nFunds Transfer Pricing\nCorporate treasury\nmanages a funds\ntransfer pricing\nmethodology that\nconsiders interest\nrate risk, liquidity\nrisk, and other\nproduct\ncharacteristics.\nOperating segments pay\na funding charge for\ntheir assets and\nreceive a funding\ncredit for their\ndeposits, both of\nwhich are included in\nnet interest income.\nThe net impact of the\nfunding charges or\ncredits is recognized\nin corporate treasury.\n\nRevenue and Expense\nSharing When lines of\nbusiness jointly serve\ncustomers, the line of\nbusiness that is\nresponsible for\nproviding the product\nor service recognizes\nrevenue or expense\nwith a referral fee\npaid or an allocation\nof cost to the other\nline of\n\nbusiness based on\nestablished internal\nrevenue-sharing\nagreements.\n\nWhen a line of\nbusiness uses a\nservice provided by\nanother line of\nbusiness or enterprise\nfunction (included in\nCorporate), expense is\ngenerally allocated\nbased on the cost and\nuse of the service\nprovided.\n\nTaxable-Equivalent\nAdjustments Taxable-\nequivalent adjustments\nrelated to tax-exempt\nincome on certain\nloans and debt\nsecurities are\nincluded in net\ninterest income, while\ntaxable-equivalent\nadjustments related to\nincome tax credits for\nlow-income housing and\nrenewable energy\ninvestments are\nincluded in\nnoninterest income, in\neach case with\ncorresponding impacts\nto income tax expense\n(benefit).

Credit Risk\nManagement We define\ncredit risk as the\nrisk of loss\nassociated with a\nborrower or\ncounterparty default\n(failure to meet\nobligations in\naccordance with agreed\nupon terms). Credit\nrisk exists with many\nof our assets and\nexposures such as debt\nsecurity holdings,\ncertain derivatives,\nand loans. The Board\u2019s\nRisk Committee has\nprimary oversight\nresponsibility for\ncredit risk. A Credit\nSubcommittee of the\nRisk Committee assists\nthe Risk Committee in\nproviding oversight of\ncredit risk. At the\nmanagement level,\nCredit Risk, which is\npart of IRM, has\noversight\nresponsibility for\ncredit risk. Credit\nRisk reports to the\nCRO and supports\nperiodic reports\nrelated to credit risk\nprovided to the\nBoard\u2019s Risk Committee\nor its Credit\nSubcommittee.

Our credit risk\nmanagement oversight process is governed\ncentrally, but provides for direct management\nand accountability by our lines of business.\nOur overall credit process includes\ncomprehensive credit policies, disciplined\ncredit underwriting, frequent and detailed\nrisk measurement and modeling, extensive\ncredit training programs, and a continual loan\nreview and audit process. A key to our credit\nrisk management is adherence to a well-\ncontrolled underwriting process, which we\nbelieve is appropriate for the needs of our\ncustomers as well as investors who purchase\nthe loans or securities collateralized by the\nloans. Credit Quality Overview Credit quality\nin third quarter 2021 reflected continued\nimprovement in the economic environment. In\nparticular: \u2022 Nonaccrual loans were $7.0\nbillion at September 30, 2021, down from $8.7\nbillion at December 31, 2020. Commercial\nnonaccrual loans decreased to $3.0 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2021, compared with $4.8 billion\nat December 31, 2020, and consumer nonaccrual\nloans increased slightly to $4.0 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2021, compared with $3.9 billion\nat December 31, 2020. Nonaccrual loans\nrepresented 0.82% of total loans at September\n30, 2021, compared with 0.98% at December 31,\n2020. \u2022 Net loan charge-offs as a percentage\nof our average commercial and consumer loan\nportfolios were 0.03% and 0.23% in the third\nquarter and 0.07% and 0.31% in the first nine\nmonths of 2021, respectively, compared with\n0.29% and 0.30% in the third quarter and 0.33%\nand 0.44% in the first nine months of 2020. \u2022\nLoans that are not government\ninsured/guaranteed and 90 days or more past\ndue and still accruing were $121 million and\n$394 million in our commercial and consumer\nportfolios, respectively, at September 30,\n2021, compared with $78 million and $612\nmillion at December 31, 2020. \u2022 Our provision\nfor credit losses for loans was $(1.4) billion\nand $(3.7) billion in the third quarter and\nfirst nine months of 2021, respectively,\ncompared with $751 million and $14.1 billion\nfor the same periods a year ago. \u2022 The ACL for\nloans decreased to $14.7 billion, or 1.70% of\ntotal loans, at September 30, 2021, compared\nwith $19.7 billion, or 2.22%, at December 31,\n2020. Additional information on our loan\nportfolios and our credit quality trends\nfollows.\n                               \n  30    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nCOVID-Related Lending\nAccommodations During\n2020, we provided\naccommodations to\ncustomers in response\nto the COVID-19\npandemic, including\npayment deferrals, and\nother expanded\nassistance for\nmortgage, credit card,\nauto, small business,\npersonal and\ncommercial lending\ncustomers. With the\nexception of\nresidential mortgage-\nrelated accommodation\nprograms, the COVID-\nrelated lending\naccommodations\ninstituted during 2020\nwere no longer offered\nas of December 31,\n2020. Residential\nmortgage accommodation\nprograms, which\ncontinued during the\nfirst nine months of\n2021, offered payment\ndeferrals for up to a\ntotal of 18 months.\n\nTable 10 summarizes\nthe unpaid principal\nbalance (UPB) of\nconsumer loans that\nreceived\naccommodations under\nloan modification\nprograms established\nto assist customers\nwith the economic\nimpact of the COVID-19\npandemic (COVID-\nrelated modifications)\nand that remained in a\ndeferral period as of\nSeptember 30, 2021.\n\nBased on guidance in\nthe CARES Act and the\nI nteragency Statement\non Loan Modifications\nand Reporting for\nFinancial Institutions\nWorking with Customers\nAffected by the\nCoronavirus (Revised)\nissued by federal\nbanking regulators in\nApril 2020 (the\nInteragency\nStatement), both of\nwhich we elected to\napply, loan\nmodifications related\nto COVID-19 and that\nmeet certain other\ncriteria are exempt\nfrom troubled debt\nrestructuring (TDR)\nclassification.\nAdditionally, our\nelection to apply the\nTDR relief provided by\nthe CARES Act and the\nInteragency Statement\nimpacts our regulatory\ncapital ratios as\nthese loan\nmodifications\n\nrelated to COVID-19\nare not adjusted to a\nhigher risk-weighting\nnormally required with\nTDR classification. At\nSeptember 30, 2021,\nsubstantially all\nresidential mortgage\nloans that were in a\ndeferral period,\nexcluding those that\nwere government\ninsured/guaranteed,\nmet the criteria for\nTDR relief and were\ntherefore not\nclassified as TDRs.\nFor additional\ninformation regarding\nthe TDR relief\nprovided by the CARES\nAct and the clarifying\nTDR accounting\nguidance from the\nInteragency Statement,\nsee Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial\nStatements in our 2020\nForm 10-K.\n\nCustomer payment\ndeferral activities\ninstituted in response\nto the COVID-19\npandemic could\ncontinue to delay the\nrecognition of charge-\noffs, delinquencies,\nand nonaccrual status\nfor those customers\nwho would have\notherwise moved into\npast due or nonaccrual\nstatus. Customer loans\nthat are not further\nmodified upon exit\nfrom the deferral\nperiod may be placed\non nonaccrual status\nor charged-off in\naccordance with our\npolicies if customers\nare unable to resume\nmaking payments in\naccordance with the\ncontractual terms of\ntheir agreement. As of\nSeptember 30, 2021,\nsubstantially all of\nour consumer loans\nwere current after\nexiting the deferral\nperiod.

Interest-\nonly loans were\napproximately 3% of\ntotal loans at both\nSeptember 30, 2021,\nand December 31, 2020.\nWe believe our\norigination process\nappropriately\naddresses our\nadjustable-rate\nmortgage (ARM) reset\nrisk across our\nresidential mortgage\nloans and our ACL for\nloans considers this\nrisk. We do not offer\noption ARM products,\nnor do we offer\nvariable-rate mortgage\nproducts with fixed\npayment amounts,\ncommonly referred to\nwithin the financial\nservices industry as\nnegative amortizing\nmortgage loans.\n\nThe residential\nmortgage \u2013 junior lien\nportfolio consists of\nresidential mortgage\nlines of credit and\nloans that are\nsubordinate in rights\nto an existing lien on\nthe same property. It\nis not unusual for\nthese lines and loans\nto have draw periods,\ninterest-only\npayments, balloon\npayments, adjustable\nrates and similar\nfeatures. Junior lien\nloan products are\nprimarily amortizing\npayment loans with\nfixed interest rates\nand repayment periods\nbetween five to 30\nyears. We continuously\nmonitor the credit\nperformance of our\nresidential mortgage \u2013\njunior lien portfolio\nfor trends and factors\nthat influence the\nfrequency and severity\nof losses, such as\njunior lien\nperformance when the\nfirst lien loan is\ndelinquent.\n\nOur residential\nmortgage lines of\ncredit (both first and\njunior lien) generally\nhave draw periods of\n10, 15 or 20 years\nwith variable interest\nrate and payment\noptions available\nduring the draw period\nof (1) interest-only\nor (2) 1.5% of\noutstanding principal\nbalance plus accrued\ninterest. As of\nSeptember 30, 2021,\nlines of credit in a\ndraw period primarily\nused the interest-only\noption. The lines that\nenter their\namortization period\nmay experience higher\ndelinquencies and\nhigher loss rates than\nthe ones in their draw\nor term period. We\nhave considered this\nincreased risk in our\nACL estimate.\n\nDuring the draw\nperiod, the borrower\nhas the option of\nconverting all or a\nportion of the line\nfrom a variable\ninterest rate to a\nfixed rate with terms\nincluding interest-\nonly payments for a\nfixed period between\nthree to seven years\nor a fully amortizing\npayment with a fixed\nperiod between five to\n30 years. At the end\nof the draw period, a\nline of credit\ngenerally converts to\nan amortizing payment\nschedule with\nrepayment terms of up\nto 30 years based on\nthe balance at time of\nconversion. Certain\nlines and loans have\nbeen structured with a\nballoon payment, which\nrequires full\nrepayment of the\noutstanding balance at\nthe end of the term\nperiod. The conversion\nof lines or loans to\nfully amortizing or\nballoon payoff may\nresult in a\nsignificant payment\nincrease, which can\naffect some borrowers\u2019\nability to repay the\noutstanding balance.\n\nIn anticipation of our\nresidential mortgage\nline of credit\nborrowers reaching the\nend of their\ncontractual\ncommitment, we have\ncreated a program to\ninform, educate and\nhelp these borrowers\ntransition from\ninterest-only to\nfully-amortizing\npayments or full\nrepayment. We monitor\nthe performance of the\n                               \n  34    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nborrowers moving\nthrough the program in\nan effort to refine\nour ongoing program\nstrategy.\n\nWe monitor changes in\nreal estate values and\nunderlying economic or\nmarket conditions for\nall geographic areas\nof our residential\nmortgage portfolio as\npart of our credit\nrisk management\nprocess. Our\nunderwriting and\nperiodic review of\nthis portfolio\nincludes original\nappraisals adjusted\nfor the change in Home\nPrice Index (HPI) or\nestimates from\nautomated valuation\nmodels (AVMs) to\nsupport property\nvalues.

The downside\nscenarios assumed\neconomic conditions\nranging from a mild\nrecession to a more\n\nsevere recession,\nreflecting continued\neconomic impacts from\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAdditionally, we\nconsider qualitative\nfactors that represent\nrisks inherent in our\nprocesses and\nassumptions such as\neconomic environmental\nfactors, modeling\nassumptions and\nperformance, and other\nsubjective factors,\nincluding industry\ntrends and emerging\nrisk assessments. We\nalso considered the\nsignificant\nuncertainty related to\nthe duration and\nseverity of the\neconomic impacts from\nthe COVID-19 pandemic\nand the incremental\nrisks to our loan\nportfolio.\n\nThe forecasted key\neconomic variables\nused in our estimate\nof the ACL for loans\nat September 30 and\nJune 30, 2021, are\npresented in Table 25.\n                               \n  44    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 25: Forecasted\nKey Economic Variables\n                                              \n               4Q           2Q           4Q   \n               20\u2026          20\u2026          20\u2026  \n  We\u2026                                         \n  bl\u2026                                         \n  of                                          \n  ec\u2026                                         \n  sc\u2026                                         \n  U.\u2026                                         \n  un\u2026                                         \n  ra\u2026                                         \n  (1\u2026                                         \n  Ju\u2026                                         \n  30,     5.6  %       6.2          6.9       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Se\u2026                                         \n  30,     5.2          6.2          6.6       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  U.\u2026                                         \n  re\u2026                                         \n  GDP                                         \n  (2\u2026                                         \n  Ju\u2026                                         \n  30,     1.0         -0.4          0.6       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Se\u2026                                         \n  30,     3.1         -0.2          0.6       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Ho\u2026                                         \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  in\u2026                                         \n  (3\u2026                                         \n  Ju\u2026                                         \n  30,     2.8         -6.5         -5.2       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Se\u2026                                         \n  30,    10.1         -1.2         -6.5       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Co\u2026                                         \n  re\u2026                                         \n  es\u2026                                         \n  as\u2026                                         \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  (3\u2026                                         \n  Ju\u2026                                         \n  30,     7.8         -11\u2026         -10\u2026       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Se\u2026                                         \n  30,     4.1         -3.3         -7.7       \n  20\u2026                                         \n                                              \n(1) Quarterly average.

Future amounts of\nthe ACL for loans will be based on a variety\nof factors, including loan balance changes,\nportfolio credit quality and mix changes, and\nchanges in general economic conditions and\nexpectations (including for unemployment and\nGDP), among other factors. We observed\neconomic improvements in the first nine months\nof 2021; however, there remained significant\nuncertainty related to the length and severity\nof the economic impact of the COVID-19\npandemic and the impact of other factors that\nmay influence the level of eventual losses and\ncorresponding requirements for future amounts\nof the ACL, including the impact of economic\nstimulus programs and customer accommodation\nactivity. The COVID-19 pandemic could continue\nto impact the recognition of credit losses in\nour loan portfolios and may result in\nincreases or decreases in our ACL. We believe\nthe ACL for loans of $14.7 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2021, was appropriate to cover\nexpected credit losses, including unfunded\ncredit commitments, at that date. The entire\nallowance is available to absorb credit losses\nfrom the total loan portfolio. The ACL for\nloans is subject to change and reflects\nexisting factors as of the date of\ndetermination, including economic or market\nconditions and ongoing internal and external\nexamination processes. Due to the sensitivity\nof the ACL for loans to changes in the\neconomic and business environment, it is\npossible that we will incur incremental credit\nlosses not anticipated as of the balance sheet\ndate. Our process for determining the ACL is\ndiscussed in the \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\n\u2013 Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d section and\nNote 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial Statements in our 2020\nForm 10-K. LIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE LOAN\nREPURCHASE LOSSES For information on our\nrepurchase liability, see the \u201cRisk Management\n\u2013 Credit Risk Management \u2013 Liability For\nMortgage Loan Repurchase Losses\u201d section in\nour 2020 Form 10-K. RISKS RELATING TO\nSERVICING ACTIVITIES In addition to servicing\nloans in our portfolio, we act as servicer\nand/or master servicer of residential mortgage\nloans included in GSE-guaranteed mortgage\nsecuritizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage\nsecuritizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed\nmortgages and private label mortgage\nsecuritizations, as well as for unsecuritized\nloans owned by institutional investors.\n\nAs a servicer, we are required to advance\ncertain delinquent payments of principal and\ninterest on mortgage loans we service. The\namount and timing of reimbursement of advances\nof delinquent payments vary by investor and\nthe applicable servicing agreements. Due to\npayment deferrals provided as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the amount of our servicing\nadvances of principal and interest remained\nelevated. The amount of these advances may\nincrease if additional payment deferrals are\nprovided. Payment deferrals also delay the\ncollection of contractually specified\nservicing fees, resulting in lower net\nservicing income. Upon transfer as servicer,\nwe retain the option to repurchase loans from\nGNMA loan securitization pools, which becomes\nexercisable when three scheduled loan payments\nremain unpaid by the borrower. We generally\nrepurchase these loans for cash and as a\nresult, our total consolidated assets do not\nchange. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nour repurchases of these loans were elevated\nin 2020 but returned to more normalized levels\nin the first nine months of 2021. These\nrepurchased loan balances were $20.4 billion\nand $34.8 billion at September 30, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020, respectively, which\nincluded $17.0 billion and $29.9 billion,\nrespectively, in our held for investment loan\nportfolio, with the remainder in loans held\nfor sale. Repurchased loans that regain\ncurrent status or are otherwise modified in\naccordance with applicable servicing\nguidelines may be included in future GNMA loan\nsecuritization pools. However, in accordance\nwith guidance issued by GNMA, certain loans\nrepurchased after June 30, 2020, are\nineligible for inclusion in future GNMA loan\nsecuritization pools until the borrower has\ntimely made six consecutive payments. This\nrequirement may delay our ability to resell\nloans into the securitization market. For\nadditional information about the risks related\nto our servicing activities, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Credit Risk Management \u2013 Risks\nRelating to Servicing Activities\u201d section in\nour 2020 Form 10-K. For additional information\non mortgage banking activities, see Note 9\n(Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial\nStatements in this Report. Asset/Liability\nManagement Asset/liability management involves\nevaluating, monitoring and managing interest\nrate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding.\nFor information on our oversight of\nasset/liability risks, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Asset/Liability Management\u201d\nsection in our 2020 Form 10-K. INTEREST RATE\nRISK Interest rate risk is created in our role\nas a financial intermediary for customers\nbased on investments such as loans and other\nextensions of credit and debt securities.\nInterest rate risk can have a significant\nimpact to our earnings. We are subject to\ninterest rate risk because: \u2022 assets and\nliabilities may mature or reprice at different\ntimes. If assets reprice faster than\nliabilities and interest rates are generally\nrising, earnings will initially increase; \u2022\nassets and liabilities may reprice at the same\ntime but by different amounts; \u2022 short-term\nand long-term market interest rates may change\nby different amounts. For example, the shape\nof the yield curve may affect yield for new\nloans and funding costs differently; \u2022 the\nremaining maturity for various assets or\nliabilities may shorten or lengthen as\ninterest rates change. For example, if long-\nterm mortgage interest rates increase sharply,\nMBS held in the debt securities portfolio may\npay down at a\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    45  \n                               \nRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement ( continued\n)\n\nslower rate than\nanticipated, which\ncould impact portfolio\nincome; or \u2022 interest\nrates may have a\ndirect or indirect\neffect on loan demand,\ncollateral values,\ncredit losses,\nmortgage origination\nvolume, and the fair\nvalue of MSRs and\nother financial\ninstruments. We assess\ninterest rate risk by\ncomparing outcomes\nunder various net\ninterest income\nsimulations using many\ninterest rate\nscenarios that differ\nin the direction of\ninterest rate changes,\nthe degree of change\nover time, the speed\nof change and the\nprojected shape of the\nyield curve. These\nsimulations require\nassumptions regarding\ndrivers of earnings\nand balance sheet\ncomposition such as\nloan originations,\nprepayment speeds on\nloans and debt\nsecurities, deposit\nflows and mix, as well\nas pricing strategies.\nOur most recent\nsimulations, as\npresented in Table 26,\nestimate net interest\nincome sensitivity\nover the next 12\nmonths using\ninstantaneous\nmovements across the\nyield curve with both\nlower and higher\ninterest rates\nrelative to our base\nscenario. Steeper and\nflatter scenarios\nmeasure non-parallel\nchanges in the yield\ncurve, with long-term\ninterest rates defined\nas all tenors three\nyears and longer\n(e.g., 10-year U.S.\nTreasury securities)\nand short-term\ninterest rates defined\nas all tenors less\nthan three years.\nWhere applicable, U.S.\ndollar interest rates\nare floored at 0.00%.\nThe following\ndescribes the\nsimulation assumptions\nfor the scenarios\npresented in Table 26:\n\u2022 Simulations are\ndynamic and reflect\nanticipated changes to\nour assets and\nliabilities. \u2022 Other\nmacroeconomic\nvariables that could\nbe correlated with the\nchanges in interest\nrates are held\nconstant. \u2022 Mortgage\nprepayment and\norigination\nassumptions vary\nacross scenarios and\nreflect only the\nimpact of the higher\nor lower interest\nrates. \u2022 Our base\nscenario deposit\nforecast incorporates\nmix changes consistent\nwith the base interest\nrate trajectory.\nDeposit mix is modeled\nto be the same as in\nthe base scenario\nacross the alternative\nscenarios. In higher\ninterest rate\nscenarios, customer\nactivity that shifts\nbalances into higher-\nyielding products\ncould reduce expected\nnet interest income. \u2022\nWe hold the size of\nthe projected debt and\nequity securities\nportfolios constant\nacross scenarios.\nTable 26: Net Interest\nIncome Sensitivity\n                                              \n                     Sep                      \n  ($ in              30,             Dec 31,  \n  billi\u2026             2021            2020     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Paral\u2026                                      \n  Shift:                                      \n  +100                                        \n  bps                                         \n  shift     $   7.4             6.7           \n  in                                          \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  rates                                       \n  -100                                        \n  bps                                         \n  shift        -2.9            -2.7           \n  in                                          \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  rates                                       \n  Steep\u2026                                      \n  yield                                       \n  curve:                                      \n  +50                                         \n  bps                                         \n  shift                                       \n  in            1.2             1.3           \n  long-\u2026                                      \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  rates                                       \n  Flatt\u2026                                      \n  yield                                       \n  curve:                                      \n  +50                                         \n  bps                                         \n  shift                                       \n  in            2.7             2.2           \n  short\u2026                                      \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  rates                                       \n  -50                                         \n  bps                                         \n  shift                                       \n  in           -1.2            -1.4           \n  long-\u2026                                      \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  rates                                       \n                                              \nThe interest rate sensitivity included in\nTable 26 indicates that we would expect to\nbenefit from higher interest rates as our\nassets would reprice faster and to a greater\ndegree than our liabilities, while in the case\nof lower interest rates, our assets would\nreprice downward and to a greater degree than\nour liabilities resulting in lower net\ninterest income. The sensitivity results above\ndo not capture noninterest income or expense\nimpacts. Our interest rate sensitive\nnoninterest income and expense are\npredominantly driven by\n\nmortgage banking activities, and may move in\nthe opposite direction of our net interest\nincome. See the \u201cRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability Management \u2013 Mortgage Banking\nInterest Rate and Market Risk\u201d section in our\n2020 Form 10-K for additional information. For\nadditional information on our trading assets\nand liabilities, see Note 2 (Trading\nActivities) to Financial Statements in this\nReport. We use the debt securities portfolio\nand exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC)\ninterest rate derivatives to manage our\ninterest rate exposures. See Note 1 (Summary\nof Significant Accounting Policies), Note 3\n(Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt\nSecurities) and Note 14 (Derivatives) to\nFinancial Statements in our 2020 Form 10-K for\nadditional information. MORTGAGE BANKING\nINTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK We originate,\nfund and service mortgage loans, which\nsubjects us to various risks, including\ncredit, liquidity and interest rate risks. For\nadditional information on mortgage banking\ninterest rate and market risk, see Note 9\n(Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial\nStatements in this Report and the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Asset/Liability Management \u2013\nMortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market\nRisk\u201d section in our 2020 Form 10-K. Hedging\nthe various sources of interest rate risk in\nmortgage banking is a complex process that\nrequires sophisticated modeling and constant\nmonitoring. There are several potential risks\nto earnings from mortgage banking related to\norigination volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs\nand associated hedging results, the\nrelationship and degree of volatility between\nshort-term and long-term interest rates, and\nchanges in servicing and foreclosures costs.\nWhile we attempt to balance our mortgage\nbanking interest rate and market risks, the\nfinancial instruments we use may not perfectly\ncorrelate with the values and income being\nhedged. MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of\npossible economic loss from adverse changes in\nmarket risk factors such as interest rates,\ncredit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity\nand commodity prices, and the risk of possible\nloss due to counterparty exposure. This\napplies to implied volatility risk, basis\nrisk, and market liquidity risk. It also\nincludes price risk in the trading book,\nmortgage servicing rights and the hedge\neffectiveness risk associated with the\nmortgage book, and impairment of private\nequity investments. For information on our\noversight of market risk, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Asset/Liability Management \u2013\nMarket Risk\u201d section in our 2020 Form 10-K.\nMARKET RISK \u2013 TRADING ACTIVITIES We engage in\ntrading activities to accommodate the\ninvestment and risk management activities of\nour customers and to execute economic hedging\nto manage certain balance sheet risks. These\ntrading activities predominantly occur within\nour CIB businesses and to a lesser extent\nother businesses of the Company. Debt\nsecurities held for trading, equity securities\nheld for trading, trading loans and trading\nderivatives are financial instruments used in\nour trading activities, and all are carried at\nfair value. Income earned on the financial\ninstruments used in our trading activities\ninclude net interest income, changes in fair\nvalue and realized gains and losses. Net\ninterest income earned from our trading\nactivities is reflected in the interest income\nand interest expense components of our\nconsolidated statement of income. Changes in\nfair value of the financial instruments used\nin our trading activities are reflected in net\ngains from trading activities. For additional\ninformation on the financial instruments used\nin our trading activities and the income from\nthese trading activities,\n                               \n  46    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nsee Note 2 (Trading\nActivities) to\nFinancial Statements\nin this Report.\n\nValue-at-risk (VaR) is\na statistical risk\nmeasure used to\nestimate the potential\nloss from adverse\nmoves in the financial\nmarkets. The Company\nuses VaR metrics\ncomplemented with\nsensitivity analysis\nand stress testing in\nmeasuring and\nmonitoring market\nrisk. For additional\ninformation on our\nmonitoring activities,\nsensitivity analysis\nand stress testing,\nsee the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Market\nRisk \u2013 Trading\nActivities\u201d section in\nour 2020 Form 10-K.\n\nTrading VaR is the\nmeasure used to\nprovide insight into\nthe market risk\nexhibited by the\nCompany\u2019s trading\npositions. The Company\ncalculates Trading VaR\nfor risk management\npurposes to establish\nline of business and\nCompany-wide risk\nlimits.\n\nTrading VaR is\ncalculated based on\nall trading positions\non our consolidated\nbalance sheet.\n\nTable 27 shows the\nCompany\u2019s Trading\nGeneral VaR by risk\ncategory. The decrease\nin average Company\nTrading General VaR\nfor the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2021,\ncompared with the same\nperiod a year ago, was\ndriven by a greater\npresence of market\nvolatility dropping\nout of the 12-month\nhistorical lookback\nwindow used to\ncalculate average\nCompany Trading\nGeneral VaR for the\nquarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2021.\nMarket volatility\npresent in average\nCompany Trading\nGeneral VaR for the\nquarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2020,\nwas driven by the\nimpact of the COVID-19\npandemic, in\nparticular, changes in\ninterest rate curves\nand a significant\nwidening of credit\nspreads.\n\nTable 27: Trading\n1-Day 99% General VaR\nby Risk Category\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) The period-end VaR\nwas less than the sum\nof the VaR components\ndescribed above, which\nis due to portfolio\ndiversification. The\ndiversification effect\narises because the\nrisks are not\nperfectly correlated\ncausing a portfolio of\npositions to usually\nbe less risky than the\nsum of the risks of\nthe positions alone.\nThe diversification\nbenefit is not\nmeaningful for low and\nhigh metrics since\nthey may occur on\ndifferent days.\n\nMARKET RISK \u2013 EQUITY\nSECURITIES We are\ndirectly and\nindirectly affected by\nchanges in the equity\nmarkets. We make and\nmanage direct\ninvestments in start-\nup businesses,\nemerging growth\ncompanies, management\nbuy-outs, acquisitions\nand corporate\nrecapitalizations. We\nalso invest in non-\naffiliated funds that\nmake similar private\nequity investments.\nFor additional\ninformation, see the\n\u201cRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Market\nRisk \u2013 Equity\nSecurities\u201d section in\nour 2020 Form 10-K.\n\nWe also have\nmarketable equity\nsecurities that\ninclude investments\nrelating to our\nventure capital\nactivities. The fair\nvalue changes in these\nmarketable equity\nsecurities are\nrecognized in net\nincome. For additional\ninformation, see Note\n6 (Equity Securities)\nto Financial\nStatements in this\nReport.\n\nChanges in equity\nmarket prices may also\nindirectly affect our\nnet income by (1) the\nvalue of third-party\nassets under\nmanagement and, hence,\nfee income, (2)\nborrowers whose\nability to repay\nprincipal and/or\ninterest may be\naffected by the stock\nmarket, or (3)\nbrokerage activity,\nrelated commission\nincome and other\nbusiness activities.\nEach business line\nmonitors and manages\nthese indirect risks.\n\nLIQUIDITY RISK AND\nFUNDING In the\nordinary course of\nbusiness, we enter\ninto contractual\nobligations that may\nrequire future cash\npayments, including\nfunding for customer\nloan requests,\ncustomer deposit\nmaturities and\nwithdrawals, debt\nservice, leases for\npremises and\nequipment, and other\ncash commitments. The\nobjective of effective\nliquidity management\nis to ensure that we\ncan meet our\ncontractual\nobligations and other\ncash commitments\nefficiently under both\nnormal operating\nconditions and under\nperiods of Wells\nFargo-specific and/or\nmarket stress. To help\nachieve this\nobjective, we monitor\nboth\n\nthe consolidated\ncompany and the Parent\non a stand-alone basis\nto ensure that the\nParent is a source of\nstrength for its\nregulated, deposit-\ntaking banking\nsubsidiaries. The\nParent acts as a\nsource of funding for\nthe Company through\nthe issuance of long-\nterm debt and equity,\nand WFC Holdings, LLC,\nan intermediate\nholding company and\nsubsidiary of the\nParent (the \u201cIHC\u201d),\nprovides funding\nsupport for the\nongoing operational\nrequirements of the\nParent and certain of\nits direct and\nindirect subsidiaries.\nFor additional\ninformation on\nliquidity risk and\nfunding management,\nsee the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Liquidity\nRisk and Funding\u201d\nsection in our 2020\nForm 10-K.

The\nboard of directors of\neach FHLB can increase\nthe minimum investment\nrequirements in the\nevent it has concluded\nthat additional\ncapital is required to\nallow it to meet its\nown regulatory capital\nrequirements. Any\nincrease in the\nminimum investment\nrequirements outside\nof specified ranges\nrequires the approval\nof the Federal Housing\nFinance Agency.\nBecause the extent of\nany obligation to\nincrease our\ninvestment in any of\nthe FHLBs depends\nentirely upon the\noccurrence of a future\nevent, the amount of\nany future investment\nin the capital stock\nof the FHLBs is not\ndeterminable.\n                               \n  50    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \n                      \n  Capital Management  \n                      \nWe have an active\nprogram for managing\ncapital through a\ncomprehensive process\nfor assessing the\nCompany\u2019s overall\ncapital adequacy. Our\nobjective is to\nmaintain capital at an\namount commensurate\nwith our risk profile\nand risk tolerance\nobjectives, and to\nmeet both regulatory\nand market\nexpectations. We\nprimarily fund our\ncapital needs through\nthe retention of\nearnings net of both\ndividends and share\nrepurchases, as well\nas through the\nissuance of preferred\nstock and long- and\nshort-term debt.\nRetained earnings at\nSeptember 30, 2021,\nincreased $13.0\nbillion from December\n31, 2020,\npredominantly as a\nresult of $15.8\nbillion of Wells Fargo\nnet income, partially\noffset by $2.6 billion\nof common and\npreferred stock\ndividends. During the\nfirst nine months of\n2021, we issued $957\nmillion of common\nstock, substantially\nall of which was\nissued in connection\nwith employee\ncompensation and\nbenefits. During the\nfirst nine months of\n2021, we repurchased\n167 million shares of\ncommon stock at a cost\nof $7.5 billion. For\nadditional information\nabout capital\nplanning, see the\n\u201cCapital Planning and\nStress Testing\u201d\nsection below.\n\nIn the first nine\nmonths of 2021, we\nissued $5.8 billion of\npreferred stock and\nredeemed $6.7 billion\nof preferred stock.\nFor additional\ninformation, see Note\n16 (Preferred Stock)\nto Financial\nStatements in this\nReport.\n                                              \n  Regulatory Capital Requirements             \n                                              \nThe Company and each\nof our IDIs are\nsubject to various\nregulatory capital\nadequacy requirements\nadministered by the\nFRB and the OCC. Risk-\nbased capital rules\nestablish risk-\nadjusted ratios\nrelating regulatory\ncapital to different\ncategories of assets\nand off-balance sheet\nexposures as discussed\nbelow.\n\nRISK-BASED CAPITAL AND\nRISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS\nThe Company is subject\nto rules issued by\nfederal banking\nregulators to\nimplement Basel III\ncapital requirements\nfor U.S. banking\norganizations. The\nrules contain two\nframeworks for\ncalculating capital\nrequirements, a\nStandardized Approach\nand an Advanced\nApproach applicable to\ncertain institutions,\nincluding Wells Fargo.\nOur capital adequacy\nis assessed based on\nthe lower of our risk-\nbased capital ratios\ncalculated under the\ntwo approaches. The\nCompany is required to\nsatisfy the risk-based\ncapital ratio\nrequirements to avoid\nrestrictions on\ncapital distributions\nand discretionary\nbonus payments. Table\n33 and Table 34\npresent the risk-based\ncapital requirements\napplicable to the\nCompany on a fully\nphased-in basis under\nthe Standardized\nApproach and Advanced\nApproach,\nrespectively, as of\nSeptember 30, 2021.\n\nTable 33: Risk-Based\nCapital Requirements \u2013\nStandardized Approach\n\nTable 34: Risk-Based\nCapital Requirements \u2013\nAdvanced Approach\n\nIn addition to the\nrisk-based capital\nrequirements described\nin Table 33 and Table\n34, if the FRB\ndetermines that a\nperiod of excessive\ncredit growth is\ncontributing to an\nincrease in systemic\nrisk, a\ncountercyclical buffer\nof up to 2.50% could\nbe added to the risk-\nbased capital ratio\nrequirements under\nfederal banking\nregulations.\n\nThe capital\nconservation buffer is\napplicable to certain\ninstitutions,\nincluding Wells Fargo,\nunder the Advanced\nApproach and is\nintended to absorb\nlosses during times of\neconomic or financial\nstress.\n\nThe stress capital\nbuffer is calculated\nbased on the decrease\nin a BHC\u2019s risk-based\ncapital ratios under\nthe severely adverse\nscenario in the FRB\u2019s\nannual supervisory\nstress test and\nrelated Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and\nReview (CCAR), plus\nfour quarters of\nplanned common stock\ndividends. Because the\nstress capital buffer\nis calculated annually\nbased on data that can\ndiffer over time, our\nstress capital buffer,\nand thus our risk-\nbased capital ratio\nrequirements under the\nStandardized Approach,\nare subject to change\nin future periods. The\nCompany\u2019s stress\ncapital buffer for the\nperiod October 1,\n2020, through\nSeptember 30, 2021,\nwas 2.50%. On August\n5, 2021, the FRB\nconfirmed that the\nCompany's stress\ncapital buffer for the\nperiod October 1,\n2021, through\nSeptember 30, 2022, is\n3.10%.\n\nAs a global\nsystemically important\nbank (G-SIB), we are\nalso subject to the\nFRB\u2019s rule\nimplementing an\nadditional capital\nsurcharge of between\n1.00-4.50% on the\nrisk-based capital\nratio requirements of\nG-SIBs. Under the\nrule, we must annually\ncalculate our\nsurcharge under two\nmethods and use the\nhigher of the two\nsurcharges. The first\nmethod (method one)\nconsiders our size,\ninterconnectedness,\ncross-jurisdictional\nactivity,\nsubstitutability, and\ncomplexity, consistent\nwith the methodology\ndeveloped by the BCBS\nand the Financial\nStability Board (FSB).\nThe second method\n(method two) uses\nsimilar inputs, but\nreplaces\nsubstitutability with\nuse of short-term\nwholesale funding and\nwill generally result\nin higher surcharges\nthan under method one.\nBecause the G-SIB\ncapital surcharge is\ncalculated annually\nbased on data that can\ndiffer over time, the\namount of the\nsurcharge is subject\nto change in future\nyears. We expect our\nG-SIB capital\nsurcharge to decrease\nby 50 basis points to\n1.50% beginning in\nfirst quarter 2022,\nsubject to\nfinalization in fourth\nquarter 2021.\n\nThe Basel III capital\nrequirements for\ncalculating CET1 and\ntier 1 capital, along\nwith risk-weighted\nassets (RWAs), are\nfully phased-in.\nHowever, the\nrequirements for\ndetermining tier 2 and\ntotal capital are\nstill in accordance\nwith transition\nrequirements\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    51  \n                               \n                                              \n  Capital Management(continued)               \n                                              \nand are scheduled to\nbe fully phased-in\nbeginning January 1,\n2022.\n\nUnder the risk-based\ncapital rules, on-\nbalance sheet assets\nand credit equivalent\namounts of derivatives\nand off-balance sheet\nitems are assigned to\none of several broad\nrisk categories\naccording to the\nobligor, or, if\nrelevant, the\nguarantor or the\nnature of any\ncollateral. The\naggregate dollar\namount in each risk\ncategory is then\nmultiplied by the risk\nweight associated with\nthat category. The\nresulting weighted\nvalues from each of\nthe risk categories\nare aggregated for\ndetermining total\nRWAs.\n\nThe tables that follow\nprovide information\nabout our risk-based\ncapital and related\nratios as calculated\nunder Basel III\ncapital rules.\nAlthough we report\ncertain capital\namounts and ratios in\naccordance with\ntransition\nrequirements for bank\nregulatory reporting\npurposes, we manage\nour capital on a fully\n\nphased-in basis.

up to 1.25% of Standardized\ncredit RWAs, in each case with any excess\nallowance for credit losses being deducted\nfrom the respective total RWAs.\n\n(5) RWAs calculated under the Advanced\nApproach

OTHER\nREGULATORY CAPITAL AND\nLIQUIDITY MATTERS For\ninformation regarding\nthe U.S.\nimplementation of the\nBasel III LCR and\nNSFR, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Asset/\nLiability Management \u2013\nLiquidity Risk and\nFunding \u2013 Liquidity\nStandards\u201d section in\nthis Report. Capital\nPlanning and Stress\nTesting Our planned\nlong-term capital\nstructure is designed\nto meet regulatory and\nmarket expectations.\nWe believe that our\nlong-term targeted\ncapital structure\nenables us to invest\nin and grow our\nbusiness, satisfy our\ncustomers\u2019 financial\nneeds in varying\nenvironments, access\nmarkets, and maintain\nflexibility to return\ncapital to our\nshareholders. Our\nlong-term targeted\ncapital structure also\nconsiders capital\nlevels sufficient to\nexceed capital\nrequirements including\nthe G-SIB capital\nsurcharge.\nAccordingly, we\ncurrently target a\nlong-term CET1 capital\nratio that is 100\nbasis points above our\nregulatory requirement\nplus an incremental\nbuffer of 25 to 50\nbasis points. Our\ncapital targets are\nsubject to change\nbased on various\nfactors, including\nchanges to the\nregulatory capital\nframework and\nexpectations for large\nbanks promulgated by\nbank regulatory\nagencies, changes to\nthe regulatory\nrequirements for our\ncapital ratios,\nplanned capital\nactions, changes in\nour risk profile and\nother factors. The FRB\ncapital plan rule\nestablishes capital\nplanning and other\nrequirements that\ngovern capital\ndistributions,\nincluding dividends\nand share repurchases,\nby certain BHCs,\nincluding Wells Fargo.\nThe FRB assesses,\namong other things,\nthe overall financial\ncondition, risk\nprofile, and capital\nadequacy of BHCs when\nevaluating their\ncapital plans. Federal\nbanking regulators\nalso require large\nBHCs and banks to\nconduct their own\nstress tests to\nevaluate whether the\ninstitution has\nsufficient capital to\ncontinue to operate\nduring periods of\nadverse economic and\nfinancial conditions.\n                               \n  56    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \n                                              \n  Securities Repurchases                      \n                                              \nFrom time to time the\nBoard authorizes the\nCompany to repurchase\nshares of our common\nstock. Although we\nannounce when the\nBoard authorizes share\nrepurchases, we\ntypically do not give\nany public notice\nbefore we repurchase\nour shares. Various\nfactors determine the\namount of our share\nrepurchases, including\nour capital\nrequirements, the\nnumber of shares we\nexpect to issue for\nemployee benefit plans\nand acquisitions,\nmarket conditions\n(including the trading\nprice of our stock),\nand regulatory and\nlegal considerations,\nincluding under the\nFRB\u2019s capital plan\nrule. Due to the\nvarious factors that\nmay impact the\n\namount of our share\nrepurchases and the\nfact that we tend to\nbe in the market\nregularly to satisfy\nrepurchase\nconsiderations under\nour capital plan, our\nshare repurchases\noccur at various price\nlevels. We may suspend\nshare repurchase\nactivity at any time.\n\nAt September 30, 2021,\nwe had remaining Board\nauthority to\nrepurchase\napproximately 500\nmillion shares,\nsubject to regulatory\nand legal conditions.\nFor additional\ninformation about\nshare repurchases\nduring third quarter\n2021, see Part II,\nItem 2 in this Report.\n                      \n  Regulatory Matters  \n                      \nThe U.S. financial\nservices industry is\nsubject to significant\nregulation and\nregulatory oversight\ninitiatives. This\nregulation and\noversight may continue\nto impact how U.S.\nfinancial services\ncompanies conduct\nbusiness and may\ncontinue to result in\nincreased regulatory\ncompliance costs.\n\nFor a discussion of\ncertain consent orders\napplicable to the\nCompany, see the\n\u201cOverview\u201d section in\nthis Report.

Six\nof these policies are\ncritical because they\nrequire management to\nmake difficult,\nsubjective and complex\njudgments about\nmatters that are\ninherently uncertain\nand because it is\nlikely that materially\ndifferent amounts\nwould be reported\nunder different\nconditions or using\ndifferent assumptions.\nThese policies govern:\n\n\u2022 the allowance for\ncredit losses;\n\n\u2022 the valuation of\nresidential MSRs;\n\n\u2022 the fair value of\nfinancial instruments;\n\n\u2022 income taxes;\n\n\u2022 liability for\ncontingent litigation\nlosses; and\n\n\u2022 goodwill impairment.\n\nManagement has\ndiscussed these\ncritical accounting\npolicies and the\nrelated estimates and\njudgments with the\nBoard\u2019s Audit\nCommittee.

We provide\nbanking, investment and mortgage products and\nservices, as well as consumer and commercial\nfinance, through banking locations and\noffices, the internet and other distribution\nchannels to individuals, businesses and\ninstitutions in all 50 states, the District of\nColumbia, and in countries outside the U.S.\nWhen we refer to \u201cWells Fargo,\u201d \u201cthe Company,\u201d\n\u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus,\u201d we mean Wells Fargo &\nCompany and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells\nFargo & Company (the Parent) is a financial\nholding company and a bank holding company. We\nalso hold a majority interest in a real estate\ninvestment trust, which has publicly traded\npreferred stock outstanding. Our accounting\nand reporting policies conform with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP) and practices in the financial services\nindustry. For discussion of our significant\naccounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 (2020 Form 10-K). To prepare\nthe financial statements in conformity with\nGAAP, management must make estimates based on\nassumptions about future economic and market\nconditions (for example, unemployment, market\nliquidity, real estate prices, etc.) that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements, income and expenses during the\nreporting period and the related disclosures.\nAlthough our estimates contemplate current\nconditions and how we expect them to change in\nthe future, it is reasonably possible that\nactual conditions could be worse than\nanticipated in those estimates, which could\nmaterially affect our results of operations\nand financial condition. Management has made\nsignificant estimates in several areas,\nincluding: \u2022 allowance for credit losses (Note\n4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit\nLosses)); \u2022 valuations of residential mortgage\nservicing rights (MSRs) (Note 8\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities) and Note 9 (Mortgage Banking\nActivities)); \u2022 valuations of financial\ninstruments (Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets\nand Liabilities)); \u2022 liabilities for\ncontingent litigation losses (Note 13 (Legal\nActions)); \u2022 income taxes; and \u2022 goodwill\nimpairment (Note 10 (Intangible Assets)).\nActual results could differ from those\nestimates. These unaudited interim financial\nstatements reflect all adjustments that are,\nin the opinion of management, necessary for a\nfair statement of the results for the periods\npresented. These adjustments are of a normal\nrecurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed\nin this Form 10-Q. The results of operations\nin the interim financial statements do not\nnecessarily indicate the results that may be\nexpected for the full year. The interim\nfinancial information should be read in\nconjunction with our 2020 Form 10-K. Change in\nAccounting Policies In second quarter 2021, we\nelected to change our accounting method for\nlow-income housing tax credit (LIHTC)\ninvestments from the equity method of\naccounting to the proportional amortization\nmethod. Under the proportional amortization\nmethod, the investments are carried at\namortized cost and amortized in proportion to\nthe tax credits received. The amortization of\nthe investments and the related tax impacts\nare recognized in income tax expense.\nPreviously, we recognized the amortization of\nthe investments in other noninterest income\nand the related tax impacts were recognized in\nincome tax expense. We determined that the\nproportional amortization method is preferable\nbecause it better aligns the financial\nstatement presentation with the economic\nimpact of these investments, which generate\ntax credits over the lives of the investments.\nAdoption of the proportional amortization\nmethod was applied retrospectively, to the\nearliest period presented, which resulted in a\ncumulative-effect adjustment to reduce\nretained earnings by $ 283million as of\nJanuary 1, 2020. In second quarter 2021, we\nalso elected to change the presentation of\ninvestment tax credits related to solar energy\ninvestments, which are accounted for under the\ndeferral method. We reclassified the\ninvestment tax credits on our consolidated\nbalance sheet from accrued expenses and other\nliabilities to a reduction of the carrying\nvalue of the investment balances. We also\nreclassified the investment tax credits, which\nare recognized over time, from income tax\nexpense to interest income for solar energy\nleases or noninterest income for solar energy\nequity investments. We determined that this\npresentation is preferable because it better\nreflects the financial statement presentation\nof the investment tax credits as an integral\ncomponent of the investments. The change in\naccounting policy was adopted retrospectively\nto January 1, 2020. Table 1.1 presents the\nimpact of the accounting policy changes for\nLIHTC investments and solar energy investments\nto our consolidated statement of income and\nconsolidated balance sheet.

The Update also\nclarifies other aspects of the relief provided\nin Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)\n848. We adopted this Update in first quarter\n2021 on a prospective basis, and the guidance\nwill be followed until the Update terminates\non December 31, 2022. The Update did not have\na material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial statements. ASU 2020-08 clarifies\nthe accounting for purchased callable debt\nsecurities carried at a premium and was issued\nto correct an unintended application of ASU\n2017-08 \u2013 Receivables\u2014Nonrefundable Fees and\nOther Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium\nAmortization on Purchased Callable Debt\nSecurities , which requires amortization of\nsuch premiums to the earliest call date, but\nwas not clear for the method to be used for\ninstruments with multiple call dates. The\nUpdate now specifies that such premiums are\namortized to the next call date and requires\nreassessment throughout the life of the\ninstruments with multiple call dates. We\nadopted this Update in first quarter 2021. The\nUpdate did not have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. ASU 2020-01\nclarifies the accounting for equity securities\nupon transition between the measurement\nalternative and equity method. The Update also\nclarifies for forward contracts and options to\npurchase equity securities an entity need not\nconsider whether upon settlement of the\nforward contract or option if the equity\nsecurities would be accounted for by the\nequity method or the fair value option. We\nadopted this Update in first quarter 2021. The\nUpdate did not have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements.

The credit quality\nindicators that we most closely monitor\ninclude credit ratings and delinquency status\nand are based on information as of our\nfinancial statement date. CREDIT RATINGS\nCredit ratings express opinions about the\ncredit quality of a debt security. We\ndetermine the credit rating of a security\naccording to the lowest credit rating made\navailable by national recognized statistical\nrating organizations (NRSROs). Debt securities\nrated investment grade, that is those with\nratings similar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as\ndefined by NRSROs, are generally considered by\nthe rating agencies and market participants to\nbe low credit risk. Conversely, debt\nsecurities rated below investment grade,\nlabeled as \u201cspeculative grade\u201d by the rating\nagencies, are considered to be distinctively\nhigher credit risk than investment grade debt\nsecurities. For debt securities not rated by\nNRSROs, we determine an internal credit grade\nof the debt securities (used for credit risk\nmanagement purposes) equivalent to the credit\nratings assigned by major credit agencies.\nSubstantially all of our debt securities were\nrated by NRSROs at September 30, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020.

are\ndelinquent in payment of amounts due under\ncontractual debt agreements have a higher\nprobability of recognition of credit losses.\nAs such, as part of our monitoring of the\ncredit quality of the debt security portfolio,\nwe consider whether debt securities we own are\npast due in payment of principal or interest\npayments and whether any securities have been\nplaced into nonaccrual status. Debt securities\nthat are past due and still accruing were\ninsignificant at both September 30, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020. The carrying value of debt\nsecurities in nonaccrual status was\ninsignificant at both September 30, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020. Charge-offs on debt\nsecurities were insignificant in the third\nquarter and first nine months of both 2021 and\n2020. Purchased debt securities with credit\ndeterioration (PCD) are not considered to be\nin nonaccrual status, as payments from issuers\nof these securities remain current. PCD\nsecurities were insignificant in the third\nquarter and first nine months of both 2021 and\n2020.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    75  \n                               \nNote 3: Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\nMaturity Debt Securities (continued)\n\nUnrealized Losses of Available-for-Sale Debt\nSecurities Table 3.5 shows the gross\nunrealized losses and fair value of AFS debt\nsecurities by length of time those individual\nsecurities in each category have been in a\ncontinuous loss position.

Credit\nimpairment is recorded as an ACL for debt\nsecurities.

We\ngenerally require a\nfee to extend such\ncommitments. Certain\ncommitments are\nsubject to loan\nagreements with\ncovenants regarding\nthe financial\nperformance of the\ncustomer or borrowing\nbase formulas on an\nongoing basis that\nmust be met before we\nare required to fund\nthe commitment. We may\nreduce or cancel\nconsumer commitments,\nincluding home equity\nlines and credit card\nlines, in accordance\nwith the contracts and\napplicable law. For\nunconditionally\ncancelable commitments\nat our discretion, we\ndo not recognize an\nACL. We may, as a\nrepresentative for\nother lenders, advance\nfunds or provide for\nthe issuance of\nletters of credit\nunder syndicated loan\nor letter of credit\nagreements. Any\nadvances are generally\nrepaid in less than a\nweek and would\nnormally require\ndefault of both the\ncustomer and another\nlender to expose us to\nloss. The unfunded\namount of these\ntemporary advance\narrangements totaled\napproximately $\n85.4billion at\nSeptember 30, 2021. We\nissue commercial\nletters of credit to\nassist customers in\npurchasing goods or\nservices, typically\nfor international\ntrade. At September\n30, 2021, and December\n31, 2020, we had $\n1.5billion and $\n1.3billion,\nrespectively, of\noutstanding issued\ncommercial letters of\ncredit. We also\noriginate multipurpose\nlending commitments\nunder which borrowers\nhave the option to\ndraw on the facility\nfor different purposes\nin one of several\nforms, including a\nstandby letter of\ncredit. See Note 11\n(Guarantees and Other\nCommitments) for\nadditional information\non standby letters of\ncredit. When we enter\ninto commitments, we\nare exposed to credit\nrisk. The maximum\ncredit risk for these\ncommitments will\ngenerally be lower\nthan the contractual\namount because a\nsignificant portion of\nthese commitments are\nnot funded. We manage\nthe potential risk in\ncommitments to lend by\nlimiting the total\namount of commitments,\nboth by individual\ncustomer and in total,\nby monitoring the size\nand maturity structure\nof these commitments\nand by applying the\nsame credit standards\nfor these commitments\nas for all of our\ncredit activities.\n\nFor loans and\ncommitments to lend,\nwe generally require\ncollateral or a\nguarantee. We may\nrequire various types\nof collateral,\nincluding commercial\nand consumer real\nestate, autos, other\nshort-term liquid\nassets such as\naccounts receivable or\ninventory and long-\nlived assets, such as\nequipment and other\nbusiness assets.\nCollateral\nrequirements for each\nloan or commitment may\nvary based on the loan\nproduct and our\nassessment of a\ncustomer\u2019s credit risk\naccording to the\nspecific credit\nunderwriting,\nincluding credit terms\nand structure.\nThe contractual amount\nof our unfunded credit\ncommitments, including\nunissued standby and\ncommercial letters of\ncredit, is summarized\nby portfolio segment\nand class of financing\nreceivable in Table\n4.4. The table\nexcludes the issued\nstandby and commercial\nletters of credit and\ntemporary advance\narrangements described\nabove.\nTable 4.4: Unfunded\nCredit Commitments\n                                              \n                     Sep              Dec     \n  (in                30,              31,     \n  mill\u2026              2021             2020    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Comm\u2026                                       \n  Comm\u2026                                       \n  and      $  404,\u2026            378,\u2026          \n  indu\u2026                                       \n  Real                                        \n  esta\u2026       8,322            7,993          \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  Real                                        \n  esta\u2026       17,9\u2026            15,6\u2026          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  Total       430,\u2026            401,\u2026          \n  comm\u2026                                       \n  Cons\u2026                                       \n  Resi\u2026                                       \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  \u2013           38,8\u2026            31,5\u2026          \n  first                                       \n  lien                                        \n  Resi\u2026                                       \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  \u2013           28,9\u2026            32,8\u2026          \n  juni\u2026                                       \n  lien                                        \n  Cred\u2026       128,\u2026            121,\u2026          \n  card                                        \n  Other       56,3\u2026            49,1\u2026          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  Total       252,\u2026            234,\u2026          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  unfu\u2026    $  682,\u2026            636,\u2026          \n  cred\u2026                                       \n  comm\u2026                                       \n                                              \n                               \n  80    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nAllowance for Credit Losses Table 4.5 presents\nthe allowance for credit losses (ACL) for\nloans, which consists of the allowance for\nloan losses and the allowance for unfunded\ncredit commitments.

The\nfollowing sections provide the credit quality\nindicators we most closely monitor. The credit\nquality indicators are generally based on\ninformation as of our financial statement\ndate, with the exception of updated Fair Isaac\nCorporation (FICO) scores and updated loan-to-\nvalue (LTV)/combined LTV (CLTV). We obtain\nFICO scores at loan origination and the scores\nare generally updated at least quarterly,\nexcept in limited circumstances, including\ncompliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act\n(FCRA). Generally, the LTV and CLTV indicators\nare updated in the second month of each\nquarter, with updates no older than June 30,\n2021. COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS We\nmanage a consistent process for assessing\ncommercial loan credit quality. Commercial\nloans are generally subject to individual risk\nassessment using our internal borrower and\ncollateral quality ratings, which is our\nprimary credit quality indicator.

principal balance to the property\u2019s\ncollateral value. CLTV refers to the\ncombination of first lien mortgage and junior\nlien mortgage (including unused line amounts\nfor credit line products) ratios. LTVs and\nCLTVs are updated quarterly using a cascade\napproach which first uses values provided by\nautomated valuation models (AVMs) for the\nproperty. If an AVM is not available, then the\nvalue is estimated using the original\nappraised value adjusted by the change in Home\nPrice Index (HPI) for the property location.\nIf an HPI is not available, the original\nappraised value is used. The HPI value is\nnormally the only method considered for high\nvalue properties, generally with an original\nvalue of $ 1million or more, as the AVM values\nhave proven less accurate for these\nproperties.\n                               \n  88    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 4.11 shows the most updated LTV and CLTV\ndistribution of the residential mortgage \u2013\nfirst lien and residential mortgage \u2013 junior\nlien loan portfolios.

We do not consider loan\nresolutions such as foreclosure or short sale\nto be a TDR. In addition, COVID-related\nmodifications are generally not classified as\nTDRs due to the relief under the CARES Act and\nthe Interagency Statement. For additional\ninformation on the TDR relief, see Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies)\nin our 2020 Form 10-K. We may require some\nconsumer borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty to make trial payments generally\nfor a period of three to four months,\naccording to the terms of a planned permanent\nmodification, to determine if they can perform\naccording to those terms. These arrangements\nrepresent trial modifications, which we\nclassify and account for as TDRs. While loans\nare in trial payment programs, their original\nterms are not considered modified and they\ncontinue to advance through delinquency status\nand accrue interest according to their\noriginal terms. Commitments to lend additional\nfunds on loans whose terms have been modified\nin a TDR amounted to $ 415million and $\n489million at September 30, 2021, and December\n31, 2020, respectively.

The amount of charge-\noff will differ from the modification terms if\nthe loan has been charged down prior to the\nmodification based on our policies. In\naddition, there may be cases where we have a\ncharge-off/down with no legal principal\nmodification.\n\n(4) Recorded investment related to interest\nrate reduction reflects the effect of reduced\ninterest rates on loans with an interest rate\nconcession as one of their concession types,\nwhich includes loans reported as a principal\nprimary modification type that also have an\ninterest rate concession.\n\n(5) Trial modifications are granted a delay in\npayments due under the original terms during\nthe trial payment period. However, these loans\ncontinue to advance through delinquency status\nand accrue interest according to their\noriginal terms. Any subsequent permanent\nmodification generally includes interest rate\nrelated concessions; however, the exact\nconcession type and resulting financial effect\nare usually not known until the loan is\npermanently modified.

we\nenter into various types of on- and off-\nbalance sheet transactions with special\npurpose entities (SPEs), which are\ncorporations, trusts, limited liability\ncompanies or partnerships that are established\nfor a limited purpose. SPEs are often formed\nin connection with securitization transactions\nwhereby financial assets are transferred to an\nSPE. SPEs formed in connection with\nsecuritization transactions are generally\nconsidered variable interest entities (VIEs).\nThe VIE may alter the risk profile of the\nasset by entering into derivative transactions\nor obtaining credit support, and issues\nvarious forms of interests in those assets to\ninvestors. When we transfer financial assets\nfrom our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE\nin connection with a securitization, we\ntypically receive cash and sometimes other\ninterests in the VIE as proceeds for the\nassets we transfer. In certain transactions\nwith VIEs, we may retain the right to service\nthe transferred assets and repurchase the\ntransferred assets if the outstanding balance\nof the assets falls below the level at which\nthe cost to service the assets exceed the\nbenefits. In addition, we may purchase the\nright to service loans transferred to a VIE by\na third party. In connection with our\nsecuritization or other VIE activities, we\nhave various forms of ongoing involvement with\nVIEs, which may include: \u2022 underwriting\nsecurities issued by VIEs and subsequently\nmaking markets in those securities; \u2022\nproviding credit enhancement on securities\nissued by VIEs through the use of letters of\ncredit or financial guarantees; \u2022 entering\ninto other derivative contracts with VIEs; \u2022\nholding senior or subordinated interests in\nVIEs; \u2022 acting as servicer or investment\nmanager for VIEs; \u2022 providing administrative\nor trustee services to VIEs; and \u2022 providing\nseller financing to VIEs. Loan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity We periodically\ntransfer consumer and commercial loans and\nother types of financial assets in\nsecuritization and whole loan sale\ntransactions. MORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S.\nGOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS\nWITH GINNIE MAE In the normal course of\nbusiness we sell originated and purchased\nresidential and commercial mortgage loans to\ngovernment-sponsored entities (GSEs). These\nloans are generally transferred into\nsecuritizations sponsored by the GSEs, which\nprovide certain credit guarantees to investors\nand servicers. We also transfer mortgage loans\ninto securitizations pursuant to Government\nNational Mortgage Association (GNMA)\nguidelines which are insured by the Federal\nHousing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\nMortgage loans eligible for securitization\nwith the GSEs or GNMA are considered\nconforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA design the\nstructure of these securitizations, sponsor\nthe involved VIEs, and have power over the\nactivities most significant to the VIE. We\naccount for loans transferred in conforming\nmortgage loan securitization transactions as\nsales and do not consolidate the VIEs as we\nare not the primary beneficiary. In exchange\nfor the transfer of loans, we typi cally\nreceive securities issued by the VIEs which we\nsell to third parties for cash or hold for\ninvestment purposes as HTM or AFS securities.\nWe also retain servicing rights on the\ntransferred loans. As a servicer, we retain\nthe option to repurchase loans from GNMA loan\nsecuritization pools, which becomes\nexercisable when three scheduled loan payments\nremain unpaid by the borrower. We repurchased\nloans of $ 780million and $ 3.7billion, during\nthe third quarter and first nine months of\n2021, respectively, and $ 22.1billion and $\n27.2billion during the third quarter and first\nnine months of 2020, respectively, which\npredominantly represented repurchases of\ngovernment insured loans. We recorded assets\nand related liabilities of $ 124million and $\n176million at September 30, 2021, and December\n31, 2020, respectively, where we did not\nexercise our option to repurchase eligible\nloans. Upon transfers of loans, we also\nprovide indemnification for losses incurred\ndue to material breaches of contractual\nrepresentations and warranties, as well as\nother recourse arrangements. At September 30,\n2021, and December 31, 2020, our liability\nassociated with these provisions was $\n202million and $ 221million, respectively, and\nthe maximum exposure to loss was $ 13.5billion\nand $ 13.7billion, respectively. Off-balance\nsheet mortgage loans sold or secu ritized\npresented in Table 8.5 are predominantly loans\nsecuritized by the GSEs and GNMA. See Note 9\n(Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional\ninformation about residential and commercial\nservicing rights, advances and servicing fees.\nSubstantially all residential servicing\nactivity is related to assets transferred to\nGSE and GNMA securitizations. NONCONFORMING\nMORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS In the normal\ncourse of business, we sell nonconforming\nresidential and commercial mortgage loans in\nsecuritization transactions that we design and\nsponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan\nsecuritizations do not involve a government\ncredit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial\ninterest holders are subject to credit risk of\nthe underlying assets held by the\nsecuritization VIE. We typically originate the\ntransferred loans, account for the transfers\nas sales and do not consolidate the VIE. We\nalso typically retain the right to service the\nloans and may hold other beneficial interests\nissued by the VIEs, such as debt securities\nheld for investment purposes. Our servicing\nrole related to nonconforming commercial\nmortgage loan securitizations is limited to\nprimary or master servicer and the most\nsignificant decisions impacting the\nperformance of the VIE are generally made by\nthe special servicer or the controlling class\nsecurity holder. For our residential\nnonconforming mortgage loan securitizations\naccounted for as sales, we either do not hold\nvariable interests that we consider\npotentially significant or are not the primary\nservicer for a majority of the VIE assets.\nWHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We also sell\nwhole loans to VIEs where we have continuing\ninvolvement in the form of financing. We\naccount for these transfers as sales, and do\nnot consolidate the VIEs as we do not have the\npower to direct the most significant\nactivities of the VIEs. Table 8.1 presents\ninformation about transfers of assets during\nthe period for which we recorded the transfers\nas sales and have continuing involvement with\nthe transferred assets. In connection with\nthese transfers, we received proceeds and\nrecorded servicing assets, securities, and\nloans. Substantially all transfers were\nrelated to residential mortgage\nsecuritizations with the GSEs or GNMA and\nresulted in no gain or loss because the loans\nwere already measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. Each of these interests are\ninitially measured at fair value.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    99  \n                               \nNote 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities (continued)\n\nServicing rights are classified as Level 3\nmeasurements, and generally securities are\nclassified as Level 2.\n\nTable 8.1: Transfers with Continuing\nInvolvement\n                                              \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                     2\u2026                2\u2026  \n  \u2026           R\u2026        C\u2026       R\u2026       C\u2026  \n  \u2026           m\u2026        m\u2026       m\u2026       m\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026    $  3\u2026        3\u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       3\u2026        3\u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1\u2026        81        1        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  3\u2026        52        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1\u2026        30        \u2026        6      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        \u2014         \u2014        \u2014        \u2014      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  1\u2026        1\u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1\u2026        1\u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       6\u2026        2\u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  1\u2026        1\u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1\u2026        98        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       9\u2026         \u2014        \u2014        \u2014      \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(1) Represents cash\nproceeds and the fair\nvalue of non-cash\nbeneficial interests\nrecognized at\nsecuritization\nsettlement.\n\n(2) Represents assets\nor liabilities\nrecognized at\nsecuritization\nsettlement date\nrelated to our\ncontinuing involvement\nin the transferred\nassets.\n\n(3) Represents debt\nsecurities obtained at\nsecuritization\nsettlement held for\ninvestment purposes\nthat are classified as\navailable-for-sale or\nheld-to-maturity,\nwhich predominantly\nrelate to agency\nsecurities.

For the\nsame period, we received $ 9.9billion in\nproceeds from the sales and recognized $\n355million of gains, which are included in\nother noninterest income on our consolidated\nstatement of income. In connection with the\nsales, we provided $ 3.8billion of\ncollateralized loan financing to a third-party\nsponsored VIE in the first nine months of\n2021. The loans are measured at amortized cost\nand are classified in loans on the\nconsolidated balance sheet. The collateral\nsupporting our loan includes the student loans\nwe sold. We do not consolidate the VIE as we\ndo not have power over the significant\nactivities of the entity. RESECURITIZATION\nACTIVITIES We enter into resecuritization\ntransactions as part of our trading activities\nto accommodate the investment and risk\nmanagement activities of our customers. In our\nresecuritization transactions, we transfer\ntrading debt securities to VIEs in exchange\nfor new beneficial interests that are sold to\nthird parties at or shortly after\nsecuritization settlement. This activity is\nperformed for customers seeking a specific\nreturn or risk profile.

For additional information about\nthese VIEs, see the \u201cLoan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity\u201d section within this\nNote. Nonconforming mortgage loan\nsecuritizations also include commercial\nmortgage loan securitizations sponsored by\nthird parties where we did not originate or\ntransfer the loans but serve as master\nservicer and invest in securities that could\nbe potentially significant to the VIE.\nConforming loan securitization and\nresecuritization transactions involving the\nGSEs and GNMA are excluded from Table 8.6\nbecause we are not the sponsor or we do not\nhave power over the activities most\nsignificant to the VIEs. Additionally, due to\nthe nature of the guarantees provided by the\nGSEs and the FHA and VA, our credit risk\nassociated with these VIEs is limited. For\nadditional information about conforming\nmortgage loan securitizations and\nresecuritizations, see the \u201cLoan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity\u201d and \"Resecuritization\nActivities\" sections within this Note. TAX\nCREDIT STRUCTURES We co-sponsor and make\ninvestments in affordable housing projects\nthat are designed to generate a return\nprimarily through the realization of federal\ntax credits. The projects are typically\nmanaged by project sponsors who have the power\nover the VIE\u2019s assets. In some instances, our\ninvestments in these structures may require\nthat we fund future capital commitments at the\ndiscretion of the project sponsors. COMMERCIAL\nREAL ESTATE LOANS We transfer purchased\nindustrial development bonds and GSE credit\nenhancements to VIEs in exchange for\nbeneficial interests. We own all of the\nbeneficial interests and may also service the\nunderlying mortgages that serve as collateral\nto the bonds. Prior to first quarter 2021, we\nconsolidated these VIEs as we controlled the\nkey decisions. During first quarter 2021, we\namended the structures such that we no longer\ncontrol the key decisions of the VIEs. The\nGSEs have the power to direct the servicing\nand workout activities of the VIE in the event\nof a default. As a result, we deconsolidated\nthe VIEs during first quarter 2021, and\nrecognized the beneficial interests at fair\nvalue on our consolidated balance sheet. OTHER\nVIE STRUCTURES We engage in various forms of\nstructured finance arrangements with other\nVIEs, including collateralized debt\nobligations, asset-backed finance structures\nand other securitizations collateralized by\nasset classes other than mortgages. Collateral\nmay include rental properties, asset-backed\nsecurities, student loans, mortgage loans and\nauto loans. We may participate in structuring\nor marketing the arrangements, as well as\nprovide financing, service one or more of the\nunderlying assets, or enter into derivatives\nwith the VIEs. We may also receive fees for\nthose services. We are not the primary\nbeneficiary of these structures because we do\nnot have power to direct the most significant\nactivities of the VIEs.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    101  \n                                \nNote 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities (continued)\nTable 8.6 provides a summary of our exposure\nto the unconsolidated VIEs described above,\nwhich includes investments in securities,\nloans, guarantees, liquidity agreements,\ncommitments and certain derivatives. We\nexclude certain transactions with\nunconsolidated VIEs when our continuing\ninvolvement is temporary or administrative in\nnature or insignificant in size. In Table 8.6,\n\u201cTotal VIE assets\u201d represents the remaining\nprincipal balance of assets held by\nunconsolidated VIEs using the most current\ninformation available. \u201cCarrying value\u201d is the\namount in our consolidated balance sheet\nrelated to our involvement with the\nunconsolidated VIEs. \u201cMaximum exposure to\nloss\u201d is determined as the carrying value of\nour investment in the VIEs excluding the\nunconditional repurchase options that have not\nbeen exercised, plus the remaining undrawn\nliquidity and lending commitments, the\nnotional amount of net written derivative\ncontracts, and generally the notional amount\nof, or stressed loss estimate for, other\ncommitments and guarantees. Debt, guarantees\nand other commitments include amounts related\nto loans sold that we may be required to\nrepurchase, or otherwise indemnify or\nreimburse the investor or insurer for losses\nincurred, due to material breach of\ncontractual representations and warranties as\nwell as other retained recourse arrangements.\nThe maximum exposure to loss for material\nbreach of contractual representations and\nwarranties represents a stressed case estimate\nwe utilize for determining stressed case\nregulatory capital needs and is considered to\nbe a remote scenario. \u201cMaximum exposure to\nloss\u201d represents estimated loss that would be\nincurred under severe, hypothetical\ncircumstances, for which we believe the\npossibility is extremely remote, such as where\nthe value of our interests and any associated\ncollateral declines to zero, without any\nconsideration of recovery or offset from any\neconomic hedges. Accordingly, this disclosure\nis not an indication of expected loss.\nTable 8.6: Unconsolidated VIEs\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Includes $ 319million and $ 310million of\nsecurities classified as trading at September\n30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n(2) All other assets includes mortgage\nservicing rights, derivative assets, and other\nassets (predominantly servicing advances).\n                                \n  102    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nConsolidated VIEs We consolidate VIEs where we\nare the primary beneficiary. We are the\nprimary beneficiary of the following structure\ntypes: COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND\nLEASES We securitize dealer floor plan loans\nand leases in a revolving master trust entity\nand hold the subordinated notes and residual\nequity interests. As servicer and residual\ninterest holder, we control the key decisions\nof the trust and consolidate the entity. The\ntotal VIE assets held by the master trust\nrepresent a majority of the total VIE assets\npresented for this category in Table 8.7. In a\nseparate transaction structure, we also\nprovide the majority of debt and equity\nfinancing to an SPE that engages in lending\nand leasing to specific vendors and service\nthe underlying collateral. OTHER VIE\nSTRUCTURES Other VIEs are primarily related to\nmunicipal tender option bond (MTOB)\ntransactions and nonconforming mortgage loan\nsecuritizations that we sponsor. MTOBs are\nvehicles to finance the purchase of municipal\nbonds through the issuance of short-term debt\nto investors. Our involvement with MTOBs\nincludes serving as the residual interest\nholder, which provides control over the key\ndecisions of the VIE, as well as the\nremarketing agent or liquidity provider\nrelated to the debt issued to investors. We\nalso securitize nonconforming mortgage loans,\nin which our involvement includes servicer of\nthe underlying assets and holder of\nsubordinate or senior securities issued by the\nVIE. Table 8.7 presents a summary of financial\nassets and liabilities of our consolidated\nVIEs. The carrying value represents assets and\nliabilities recorded on our consolidated\nbalance sheet. Carrying values of assets are\npresented using GAAP measurement methods,\nwhich may include fair value, credit\nimpairment or other adjustments, and therefore\nin some instances will differ from \u201cTotal VIE\nassets.\u201d On our consolidated balance sheet, we\nseparately disclose (1) the consolidated\nassets of certain VIEs that can only be used\nto settle the liabilities of those VIEs, and\n(2) the consolidated liabilities of certain\nVIEs for which the VIE creditors do not have\nrecourse to Wells Fargo.\n\nTable 8.7: Transactions with Consolidated VIEs\n                                              \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2013                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n             \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n             \u2014      \u2014      \u2014      \u2014      \u2014    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2014    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) Includes $\n114million and $\n269million of\nsecurities classified\nas trading at\nSeptember 30, 2021,\nand December 31, 2020,\nrespectively.\n\n(2) All other assets\nincludes cash and due\nfrom banks, Interest-\nearning deposits with\nbanks, derivative\nassets, equity\nsecurities, and other\nassets.\n\n(3) All other\nliabilities includes\nshort-term borrowings,\nderivative\nliabilities, and\naccrued expenses and\nother liabilities.\n\n(4) For structure\ndescription, see the\n\"Transactions with\nUnconsolidated VIEs\"\nsection within this\nNote.

The credit risk related to these\nadvances is limited since the reimbursement is\ngenerally senior to cash payments to\ninvestors. We also advance payments of taxes\nand insurance for our owned loans which are\ncollectible from the borrower. We maintain an\nallowance for uncollectible amounts for\nadvances on loans serviced for others that may\nnot be reimbursed if the payments were not\nmade in accordance with applicable servicing\nagreements or if the insurance or servicing\nagreements contain limitations on\nreimbursements. Servicing advances on owned\nloans are charged-off when deemed\nuncollectible.

Estimated\nmaximum exposure to loss was $ 218million and\n$ 1.4billion with related collateral of $\n2.5billion and $ 1.2billion as of September\n30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n\u201cMaximum exposure to loss\u201d and \u201cNon-investment\ngrade\u201d are required disclosures under GAAP.\nMaximum exposure to loss represents the\nestimated loss that would be incurred under an\nassumed hypothetical circumstance, despite\nwhat we believe is a remote possibility, where\nthe value of our interests and any associated\ncollateral declines to zero. Maximum exposure\nto loss estimates in Table 11.1 do not reflect\neconomic hedges or collateral we could use to\noffset or recover losses we may incur under\nour guarantee agreements. Accordingly, this\nrequired disclosure is not an indication of\nexpected loss. We believe the carrying value\nis more representative of our exposure to loss\nthan maximum exposure to loss. The carrying\nvalue represents the fair value of the\nguarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL\nfor guarantees, if applicable. Non-investment\ngrade represents those guarantees on which we\nhave a higher risk of performance under the\nterms of the guarantee. If the underlying\nassets under the guarantee are non-investment\ngrade (that is, an external rating that is\nbelow investment grade or an internal credit\ndefault grade that is equivalent to a below\ninvestment grade external rating), we consider\nthe risk of performance to be high. Internal\ncredit default grades are determined based\nupon the same credit policies that we use to\nevaluate the risk of payment or performance\nwhen making loans and other extensions of\ncredit. Credit quality indicators we usually\nconsider in evaluating risk of payments or\nperformance are described in Note 4 (Loans and\nRelated Allowance for Credit Losses). MERCHANT\nPROCESSING SERVICES We provide debit and\ncredit card transaction processing services\nthrough payment networks directly for\nmerchants and as a sponsor for merchant\nprocessing servicers, including our joint\nventure with a third party that is accounted\nfor as an equity method investment. In our\nrole as the merchant acquiring bank, we have a\npotential obligation in connection with\npayment and delivery disputes between the\nmerchant and the cardholder that are resolved\nin favor of the cardholder. If we are unable\nto collect the amounts from the merchant, we\nincur a loss for the refund to the cardholder.\nWe are secondarily obligated to make a refund\nfor transactions involving sponsored merchant\nprocessing servicers. We generally have a low\nlikelihood of loss in connection with our\nmerchant processing services because most\nproducts and services are delivered when\npurchased and amounts are generally refunded\nwhen items are returned to the merchant. In\naddition, we may reduce our risk in connection\nwith these transactions by withholding future\npayments and requiring cash or other\ncollateral. For the first nine months of 2021,\nwe processed card transaction volume of $\n1.2trillion as a merchant acquiring bank, and\nrelated losses, including those from our joint\nventure entity, were immaterial.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    107  \n                                \nNote 11: Guarantees\nand Other Commitments\n(continued)\n\nGUARANTEES OF\nSUBSIDIARIES In the\nnormal course of\nbusiness, the Parent\nmay provide\ncounterparties with\nguarantees related to\nits subsidiaries\u2019\nobligations. These\nobligations are\nincluded in the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated\nbalance sheet or are\nreflected as off-\nbalance sheet\ncommitments, and\ntherefore, the Parent\nhas not recognized a\nseparate liability for\nthese guarantees. The\nParent fully and\nunconditionally\nguarantees the payment\nof principal,\ninterest, and any\nother amounts that may\nbe due on securities\nthat its 100% owned\nfinance subsidiary,\nWells Fargo Finance\nLLC, may issue.These\nsecurities are not\nguaranteed by any\nother subsidiary of\nthe Parent. The\nguaranteed liabilities\nwere $ 1.3billion and\n$ 2.3billion at\nSeptember 30, 2021,\nand December 31, 2020,\nrespectively. These\nguarantees rank on\nparity with all of the\nParent\u2019s other\nunsecured and\nunsubordinated\nindebtedness. The\nassets of the Parent\nconsist primarily of\nequity in its\nsubsidiaries, and the\nParent is a separate\nand distinct legal\nentity from its\nsubsidiaries. As a\nresult, the Parent\u2019s\nability to address\nclaims of holders of\nthese debt securities\nagainst the Parent\nunder the guarantee\ndepends on the\nParent\u2019s receipt of\ndividends, loan\npayments and other\nfunds from its\nsubsidiaries. If any\nof the Parent\u2019s\nsubsidiaries becomes\ninsolvent, the direct\ncreditors of that\nsubsidiary will have a\nprior claim on that\nsubsidiary\u2019s assets.\nThe rights of the\nParent and the rights\nof the Parent\u2019s\ncreditors will be\nsubject to that prior\nclaim unless the\nParent is also a\ndirect creditor of\nthat subsidiary. For\nadditional information\nregarding other\nrestrictions on the\nParent\u2019s ability to\nreceive dividends,\nloan payments and\nother funds from its\nsubsidiaries, see Note\n23 (Regulatory Capital\nRequirements and Other\nRestrictions).\n\nOTHER COMMITMENTS To\nmeet the financing\nneeds of our\ncustomers, we may\nenter into commitments\nto purchase debt and\nequity securities to\nprovide capital for\ntheir funding,\nliquidity or other\nfuture needs. As of\nboth September 30,\n2021, and December 31,\n2020, we had\ncommitments to\npurchase debt\nsecurities of $\n18million and\ncommitments to\npurchase equity\nsecurities of $\n2.9billion and $\n3.2billion,\nrespectively. As part\nof maintaining our\nmemberships in certain\nclearing\norganizations, we are\nrequired to stand\nready to provide\nliquidity to sustain\nmarket clearing\nactivity in the event\nunforeseen events\noccur or are deemed\nlikely to occur.\nCertain of these\nobligations are\nguarantees of other\nmembers\u2019 performance\nand accordingly are\nincluded in Table 11.1\nin Other guarantees\nand indemnifications.\nAlso, we have\ncommitments to\npurchase loans and\nsecurities under\nresale agreements from\ncertain\ncounterparties,\nincluding central\nclearing\norganizations. The\namount of our unfunded\ncontractual\ncommitments was $\n10.8billion and $\n12.0billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2021,\nand December 31, 2020,\nrespectively. Given\nthe nature of these\ncommitments, they are\nexcluded from Table\n4.4 (Unfunded Credit\nCommitments) in Note 4\n(Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses).\n                                \n  108    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \n                                         \n  Note 12:Pledged Assets and Collateral  \n                                         \nPledged Assets Table 12.1 provides the\ncarrying amount of on-balance sheet pledged\nassets and the fair value of other pledged\ncollateral. Other pledged collateral is\ncollateral we have received from third\nparties, have the right to repledge and is not\nrecognized on our consolidated balance sheet.\nTRADING RELATED ACTIVITY Our trading\nbusinesses may pledge debt and equity\nsecurities in connection with securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase (repurchase\nagreements) and securities lending\narrangements. The collateral that we pledge\nrelated to our trading activities may include\nour own collateral as well as collateral that\nwe have received from third parties and have\nthe right to repledge. All of the collateral\nwe pledge related to trading activity is\neligible to be repledged or sold by the\nsecured party. NON-TRADING RELATED ACTIVITY As\npart of our liquidity management strategy, we\nmay pledge loans, debt securities, and other\nfinancial assets to secure trust and public\ndeposits, borrowings and letters of credit\nfrom the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (FRB) and for other purposes as\nrequired or permitted by law or insurance\nstatutory requirements. Substantially all of\nthe non-trading activity pledged collateral is\nnot eligible to be repledged or sold by the\nsecured party. VIE RELATED We pledge assets in\nconnection with various types of transactions\nentered into with VIEs. These pledged assets\ncan only be used to settle the liabilities of\nthose entities. We also have loans recorded on\nour consolidated balance sheet which represent\ncertain delinquent loans that are eligible for\nrepurchase from GNMA loan securitizations.

These activities are\nconducted through our broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, through\nother bank entities. Our securities financing\nactivities primarily involve high-quality,\nliquid securities such as U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and government agency securities\nand, to a lesser extent, less liquid\nsecurities, including equity securities,\ncorporate bonds and asset-backed securities.\nWe account for these transactions as\ncollateralized financings in which we\ntypically receive or pledge securities as\ncollateral. We believe these financing\ntransactions generally do not have material\ncredit risk given the collateral provided and\nthe related monitoring processes. OFFSETTING\nOF SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES Table 12.2\npresents resale and repurchase agreements\nsubject to master repurchase agreements (MRA)\nand securities borrowing and lending\nagreements subject to master securities\nlending agreements (MSLA). Collateralized\nfinancings, and those with a single\ncounterparty, are presented net on our\nconsolidated balance sheet, provided certain\ncriteria are met that permit balance sheet\nnetting. The majority of transactions subject\nto these agreements do not meet those criteria\nand thus are not eligible for balance sheet\nnetting. Collateral we pledged consists of\nnon-cash instruments, such as securities or\nloans, and is not netted on the consolidated\nbalance sheet against the related liability.\nCollateral we received includes securities or\nloans and is not recognized on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. Collateral pledged\nor received may be increased or decreased over\ntime to maintain certain contractual\nthresholds, as the assets underlying each\narrangement fluctuate in value. Generally,\nthese agreements require collateral to exceed\nthe asset or liability recognized on\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    109  \n                                \nNote 12: Pledged Assets and Collateral\n(continued)\n\nthe balance sheet. The following table\nincludes the amount of collateral pledged or\nreceived related to exposures subject to\nenforceable MRAs or MSLAs. While these\nagreements are typically over-collateralized,\nU.S. GAAP requires disclosure in this table to\nlimit the reported amount of such collateral\nto the amount of the related recognized asset\nor liability for each counterparty. In\naddition to the amounts included in Table\n12.2, we also have balance sheet netting\nrelated to derivatives that is disclosed in\nNote 14 (Derivatives).\n\nTable 12.2: Offsetting \u2013 Securities Financing\nActivities\n                                              \n                     Sep              Dec     \n  (in                30,              31,     \n  mill\u2026              2021             2020    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Asse\u2026                                       \n  Resa\u2026                                       \n  and                                         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  borr\u2026                                       \n  agre\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026    $  105,\u2026            92,4\u2026          \n  reco\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  offs\u2026                                       \n  in          -18,\u2026            -11,\u2026          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (1)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  in                                          \n  cons\u2026       86,9\u2026            80,9\u2026          \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (2)                                         \n  Coll\u2026                                       \n  not                                         \n  reco\u2026                                       \n  in          -86,\u2026            -80,\u2026          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (3)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026    $    802              775          \n  (4)                                         \n  Liab\u2026                                       \n  Repu\u2026                                       \n  and                                         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  lend\u2026                                       \n  agre\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026    $  47,3\u2026            57,6\u2026          \n  reco\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  offs\u2026                                       \n  in          -18,\u2026            -11,\u2026          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (1)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  in                                          \n  cons\u2026       29,1\u2026            46,1\u2026          \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (5)                                         \n  Coll\u2026                                       \n  pled\u2026                                       \n  but                                         \n  not                                         \n  nett\u2026       -28,\u2026            -45,\u2026          \n  in                                          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (6)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026    $    206              290          \n  (4)                                         \n                                              \n(1) Represents recognized amount of resale and\nrepurchase agreements with counterparties\nsubject to enforceable MRAs that have been\noffset in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n(2) Includes $ 67.8billion and $ 65.6billion\nclassified on our consolidated balance sheet\nin federal funds sold and securities purchased\nunder resale agreements at September 30, 2021,\nand December 31, 2020, respectively.

At September 30, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020, we have received total\ncollateral with a fair value of $ 122.0billion\nand $ 108.5billion, respectively, all of which\nwe have the right to sell or repledge. These\namounts include securities we have sold or\nrepledged to others with a fair value of $\n32.1billion and $ 36.1billion at September 30,\n2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n\n(4) Represents the amount of our exposure\n(assets) or obligation (liabilities) that is\nnot collateralized and/or is not subject to an\nenforceable MRA or MSLA.\n\n(5) Amount is classified in short-term\nborrowings on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n(6) Represents the fair value of collateral we\nhave pledged, related to enforceable MRAs or\nMSLAs, limited in the table above to the\namount of the recognized liability owed to\neach counterparty. At September 30, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020, we have pledged total\ncollateral with a fair value of $ 48.3billion\nand $ 59.2billion, respectively, substantially\nall of which may be sold or repledged by the\ncounterparty.\n\nREPURCHASE AND SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements\nand securities lending arrangements are\neffectively short-term collateralized\nborrowings. In these transactions, we receive\ncash in exchange for transferring securities\nas collateral and recognize an obligation to\nreacquire the securities for cash at the\ntransaction\u2019s maturity. These types of\ntransactions create risks, including (1) the\ncounterparty may fail to return the securities\nat maturity, (2) the fair value of the\nsecurities transferred may decline below the\namount of our obligation to reacquire the\nsecurities, and therefore create an obligation\nfor us to pledge additional amounts, and (3)\nthe counterparty may accelerate the maturity\non demand, requiring us to reacquire the\nsecurity prior to contractual maturity. We\nattempt to mitigate these risks in various\nways. Our collateral primarily consists of\nhighly liquid securities. In addition, we\nunderwrite and monitor the financial strength\nof our counterparties, monitor the fair value\nof collateral pledged relative to\ncontractually required repurchase amounts, and\nmonitor that our collateral is properly\nreturned through the clearing and settlement\nprocess in advance of our cash repayment.\nTable 12.3 provides the gross amounts\nrecognized on the consolidated balance sheet\n(before the effects of offsetting) of our\nliabilities for repurchase and securities\nlending agreements disaggregated by underlying\ncollateral type.\n                                \n  110    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nTable 12.3: Gross Obligations by Underlying\nCollateral Type\n                                              \n                      Sep              Dec    \n  (in                 30,              31,    \n  mill\u2026               2021             2020   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Repu\u2026                                       \n  agre\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  U.S.                                        \n  Trea\u2026    $  22,779           22,922         \n  and                                         \n  fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  U.S.                                        \n  Stat\u2026            1                4         \n  and                                         \n  poli\u2026                                       \n  subd\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026        5,465           15,353         \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Non-\u2026                                       \n  mort\u2026          877            1,069         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Corp\u2026                                       \n  debt         9,517            9,944         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Asse\u2026          972            1,054         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Equi\u2026          725            1,500         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Other          778              336         \n  Total       41,114           52,182         \n  repu\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  lend\u2026                                       \n  arra\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  U.S.                                        \n  Trea\u2026           47               64         \n  and                                         \n  fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026           35               23         \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Corp\u2026                                       \n  debt            98               79         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Equi\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026        5,992            5,189         \n  (1)                                         \n  Other           33               85         \n  Total                                       \n  secu\u2026        6,205            5,440         \n  lend\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  repu\u2026                                       \n  and      $  47,319           57,622         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  lend\u2026                                       \n                                              \n(1) Equity securities are generally exchange\ntraded and represent collateral received from\nthird parties that has been repledged.

These proceedings and\ninvestigations include actions brought against\nWells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries with\nrespect to corporate-related matters and\ntransactions in which Wells Fargo and/or our\nsubsidiaries were involved. In addition, Wells\nFargo and our subsidiaries may be requested to\nprovide information or otherwise cooperate\nwith government authorities in the conduct of\ninvestigations of other persons or industry\ngroups. We establish accruals for legal\nactions when potential losses associated with\nthe actions become probable and the costs can\nbe reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we\nrecord the amount we consider to be the best\nestimate within a range of potential losses\nthat are both probable and estimable; however,\nif we cannot determine a best estimate, then\nwe record the low end of the range of those\npotential losses. There can be no assurance as\nto the ultimate outcome of legal actions,\nincluding the matters described below, and the\nactual costs of resolving legal actions may be\nsubstantially higher or lower than the amounts\naccrued for those actions. ATM ACCESS FEE\nLITIGATION In October 2011, plaintiffs filed a\nputative class action, Mackmin, et al. v.\nVisa, Inc. et al. , against Wells Fargo &\nCompany, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Visa,\nMasterCard, and several other banks in the\nUnited States District Court for the District\nof Columbia. Plaintiffs allege that the Visa\nand MasterCard requirement that if an ATM\noperator charges an access fee on Visa and\nMasterCard transactions, then that fee cannot\nbe greater than the access fee charged for\ntransactions on other networks, violates\nantitrust rules. Plaintiffs seek treble\ndamages, restitution, injunctive relief, and\nattorneys\u2019 fees where available under federal\nand state law. Two other antitrust cases that\nmake similar allegations were filed in the\nsame court, but these cases did not name Wells\nFargo as a defendant. On February 13, 2013,\nthe district court granted defendants\u2019 motions\nto dismiss the threeactions. Plaintiffs\nappealed the dismissals and, on August 4,\n2015, the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe District of Columbia Circuit vacated the\ndistrict court\u2019s decisions and remanded the\nthreecases to the district court for further\nproceedings. On June 28, 2016, the United\nStates Supreme Court granted defendants\u2019\npetitions for writ of certiorari to review the\ndecisions of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia. On\nNovember 17, 2016, the United States Supreme\nCourt dismissed the petitions as improvidently\ngranted, and the threecases returned to the\ndistrict court for further proceedings. The\nCompany has entered into an agreement pursuant\nto which the Company will pay $ 20.8million to\nresolve the cases, subject to court approval.\nAUTOMOBILE LENDING MATTERS On April 20, 2018,\nthe Company entered into consent orders with\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n(OCC) and the Consumer Financial Protection\nBureau (CFPB) to resolve, among other things,\ninvestigations by the agencies into the\nCompany\u2019s compliance risk management program\nand its past practices involving certain\nautomobile collateral protection insurance\n(CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest\nrate lock extensions. The consent orders\nrequire remediation to customers and the\npayment of a total of $ 1.0billion in civil\nmoney penalties to the agencies. In July 2017,\nthe Company announced a plan to remediate\ncustomers who may have been financially harmed\ndue to issues related to automobile CPI\npolicies purchased through a third-party\nvendor on their behalf. Multiple putative\nclass actions alleging, among other things,\nunfair and deceptive practices relating to\nthese CPI policies, were filed against the\nCompany and consolidated into onemulti-\ndistrict litigation in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Central District of\nCalifornia. As previously disclosed, the\nCompany entered into a settlement to resolve\nthe multi-district litigation. Shareholders\nalso filed a putative securities fraud class\naction against the Company and its executive\nofficers alleging material misstatements and\nomissions of CPI-related information in the\nCompany\u2019s public disclosures. In January 2020,\nthe court dismissed this action as to all\ndefendants except the Company and a former\nexecutive officer and limited the action to\ntwo alleged misstatements. In addition, the\nCompany is subject to a class action in the\nUnited States District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California alleging that customers\nare entitled to refunds related to the unused\nportion of guaranteed automobile protection\n(GAP) waiver or insurance agreements between\nthe customer and dealer and, by assignment,\nthe lender. In June 2021, the court granted\npreliminary approval of an agreement pursuant\nto which the Company will pay $ 45million and\nmake certain changes to its GAP refund\npractices in order to settle the action.\nAllegations related to the CPI and GAP\nprograms were among the subjects of a\nshareholder derivative lawsuit in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California, which has been\ndismissed. In addition, federal and state\ngovernment agencies, including the CFPB, have\nundertaken formal or informal inquiries,\ninvestigations, or examinations regarding\nthese and other issues related to the\norigination, servicing, and collection of\nconsumer auto loans, including related\ninsurance products. As previously disclosed,\nthe Company entered into an agreement to\nresolve investigations by the state attorneys\ngeneral. COMMERCIAL LENDING SHAREHOLDER\nLITIGATION In October and November 2020,\nplaintiffs filed two putative securities fraud\nclass actions, which were consolidated into\nonelawsuit pending in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia alleging that the Company and\ncertain of its current and former officers\nmade false and misleading statements or\nomissions regarding, among other things, the\nCompany\u2019s commercial lending underwriting\npractices, the credit quality of its\ncommercial credit portfolios, and the value of\nits commercial loans, collateralized loan\nobligations and commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities.\n                                \n  112    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nCONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION Wells\nFargo shareholders have brought a putative\nsecurities fraud class action in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York alleging that the Company\nand certain of its current and former\nexecutive officers and directors made false or\nmisleading statements regarding the Company\u2019s\nefforts to comply with the February 2018\nconsent order with the Federal Reserve Board\nand the April 2018 consent orders with the\nCFPB and OCC. Allegations related to the\nCompany\u2019s efforts to comply with these three\nconsent orders are also among the subjects of\na shareholder derivative lawsuit pending in\nthe United States District Court for the\nNorthern District of California. CONSUMER\nDEPOSIT ACCOUNT RELATED REGULATORY\nINVESTIGATIONS The CFPB is conducting an\ninvestigation into whether customers were\nunduly harmed by the Company\u2019s historical\npractices associated with the freezing (and,\nin many cases, closing) of consumer deposit\naccounts after the Company detected suspected\nfraudulent activity (by third parties or\naccount holders) that affected those accounts.\nThe CFPB is also investigating certain of the\nCompany's past disclosures to customers\nregarding the minimum qualifying debit card\nusage required for customers to receive a\nwaiver of monthly service fees on certain\nconsumer deposit accounts. FOREIGN EXCHANGE\nBUSINESS The United States Department of\nJustice (Department of Justice) is\ninvestigating certain activities in the\nCompany\u2019s foreign exchange business, including\nwhether customers may have received pricing\ninconsistent with commitments made to those\ncustomers. On September 27, 2021, the United\nStates District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York approved a settlement\npursuant to which the Company paid $\n37.5million to the United States and provided\ncustomer remediation in order to resolve the\ninvestigation. Previous investigations by\nother federal government agencies have been\nresolved. INTERCHANGE LITIGATION Plaintiffs\nrepresenting a class of merchants have filed\nputative class actions, and individual\nmerchants have filed individual actions,\nagainst Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo &\nCompany, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and Wachovia\nCorporation regarding the interchange fees\nassociated with Visa and MasterCard payment\ncard transactions. Visa, MasterCard, and\nseveral other banks and bank holding companies\nare also named as defendants in these actions.\nThese actions have been consolidated in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York. The amended and\nconsolidated complaint asserts claims against\ndefendants based on alleged violations of\nfederal and state antitrust laws and seeks\ndamages, as well as injunctive relief.\nPlaintiff merchants allege that Visa,\nMasterCard, and payment card issuing banks\nunlawfully colluded to set interchange rates.\nPlaintiffs also allege that enforcement of\ncertain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged\ntying and bundling of services offered to\nmerchants are anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and\nWachovia, along with other defendants and\nentities, are parties to Loss and Judgment\nSharing Agreements, which provide that they,\nalong with other entities, will share, based\non a formula, in any losses from the\nInterchange Litigation. On July 13, 2012,\nVisa, MasterCard, and the financial\ninstitution defendants, including Wells Fargo,\nsigned a memorandum of understanding with\nplaintiff merchants to resolve the\nconsolidated class action and reached a\nseparate settlement in principle of the\nconsolidated individual actions. The\nsettlement payments to be made by all\ndefendants in the consolidated class and\nindividual actions totaled approximately $\n6.6billion before reductions applicable to\ncertain merchants opting out of the\nsettlement. The class settlement also provided\nfor the distribution to class merchants of 10\nbasis points of default interchange across all\ncredit rate categories for a period of eight\nconsecutive months. The district court granted\nfinal approval of the settlement, which was\nappealed to the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit by settlement objector\nmerchants. Other merchants opted out of the\nsettlement and are pursuing several individual\nactions. On June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit\nvacated the settlement agreement and reversed\nand remanded the consolidated action to the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York for further proceedings.\nOn November 23, 2016, prior class counsel\nfiled a petition to the United States Supreme\nCourt, seeking review of the reversal of the\nsettlement by the Second Circuit, and the\nSupreme Court denied the petition on March 27,\n2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court\nappointed lead class counsel for a damages\nclass and an equitable relief class. The\nparties have entered into a settlement\nagreement to resolve the money damages class\nclaims pursuant to which defendants will pay a\ntotal of approximately $ 6.2billion, which\nincludes approximately $ 5.3billion of funds\nremaining from the 2012 settlement and $\n900million in additional funding. The\nCompany\u2019s allocated responsibility for the\nadditional funding is approximately $\n94.5million. The court granted final approval\nof the settlement on December 13, 2019, which\nwas appealed to the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit by settlement\nobjector merchants. On September 27, 2021, the\ndistrict court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion\nfor class certification in the equitable\nrelief case. Several of the opt-out and direct\naction litigations have been settled while\nothers remain pending. LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX\nCREDITS Federal government agencies have\nundertaken formal or informal inquiries or\ninvestigations regarding the manner in which\nthe Company purchased, and negotiated the\npurchase of, certain federal low income\nhousing tax credits in connection with the\nfinancing of low income housing developments.\nMORTGAGE LENDING MATTERS Plaintiffs\nrepresenting a class of mortgage borrowers\nhave filed separate putative class actions,\nHernandez v. Wells Fargo, et al. , Coordes v.\nWells Fargo, et al. , Ryder v. Wells Fargo ,\nLiguori v. Wells Fargo , and Dore v. Wells\nFargo , against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California, the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Washington,\nthe United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of Ohio, the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of\nNew York, and the United States District Court\nfor the Western District of Pennsylvania,\nrespectively. Plaintiffs allege that Wells\nFargo improperly denied mortgage loan\nmodifications or repayment plans to customers\nin the foreclosure process due to the\noverstatement of foreclosure attorneys\u2019 fees\nthat were included for purposes of determining\nwhether a customer in the foreclosure process\nqualified for a mortgage loan modification or\nrepayment plan. In March 2020, the Company\nentered into an agreement pursuant to which\nthe Company paid $ 18.5million to resolve the\nclaims of the initial certified class in the\nHernandez case, which was approved by the\ndistrict court in October 2020. The Hernandez\nsettlement has been reopened to include\nadditional borrowers who the Company\ndetermined should have been included in the\nsettlement class because the Company\nidentified a population of additional\nborrowers during the relevant class period\nwhose loans had not previously been reviewed\nfor inclusion in the original population of\nimpacted\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    113  \n                                \n                                              \n  Note 13:Legal Actions(continued)            \n                                              \ncustomers. In June 2021, the Company entered\ninto an agreement pursuant to which the\nCompany will pay an additional approximately $\n22million to resolve the Hernandez case. In\nJuly 2021, the Company entered into an\nagreement in the Ryder case pursuant to which\nthe Company will pay $ 12million to cover\nother impacted borrowers who were not included\nin the Hernandez case. The Dore, Coordes, and\nLiguori cases have been voluntarily dismissed.\nIn addition, federal and state government\nagencies, including the CFPB, have undertaken\nformal or informal inquiries or investigations\nregarding these and other mortgage servicing\nmatters. On September 9, 2021, the OCC\nassessed a $ 250million civil money penalty\nagainst the Company regarding loss mitigation\nactivities in the Company\u2019s Home Lending\nbusiness and insufficient progress in\naddressing requirements under the OCC\u2019s April\n2018 consent order. In addition, on September\n9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent\norder with the OCC requiring the Company to\nimprove the execution, risk management, and\noversight of loss mitigation activities in its\nHome Lending business. NOMURA/NATIXIS\nMORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION In August 2014 and\nAugust 2015, Nomura Credit & Capital Inc.\n(Nomura) and Natixis Real Estate Holdings, LLC\n(Natixis) filed a total of seventhird-party\ncomplaints against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in\nNew York state court. In the underlying first-\nparty actions, Nomura and Natixis have been\nsued for alleged breaches of representations\nand warranties made in connection with\nresidential mortgage-backed securities\nsponsored by them. In the third-party actions,\nNomura and Natixis allege that Wells Fargo, as\nmaster servicer, primary servicer or\nsecurities administrator, failed to notify\nNomura and Natixis of their own breaches,\nfailed to properly oversee the primary\nservicers, and failed to adhere to accepted\nservicing practices. Natixis additionally\nalleges that Wells Fargo failed to perform\ndefault oversight duties. Wells Fargo has\nasserted counterclaims alleging that Nomura\nand Natixis failed to provide Wells Fargo\nnotice of their representation and warranty\nbreaches. OFAC RELATED INVESTIGATION The\nCompany has self-identified an issue whereby\ncertain foreign banks utilized a Wells Fargo\nsoftware-based solution to conduct\nimport/export trade-related financing\ntransactions with countries and entities\nprohibited by the Office of Foreign Assets\nControl (OFAC) of the United States Department\nof the Treasury. We do not believe any funds\nrelated to these transactions flowed through\naccounts at Wells Fargo as a result of the\naforementioned conduct. The Company has made\nvoluntary self-disclosures to OFAC and is\ncooperating with an inquiry from the\nDepartment of Justice. RETAIL SALES PRACTICES\nMATTERS A number of bodies or entities,\nincluding (a) federal, state, and local\ngovernment agencies, including the Department\nof Justice, the United States Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC), and the United\nStates Department of Labor, (b) state\nattorneys general, including the New York\nAttorney General, and (c) Congressional\ncommittees, have undertaken formal or informal\ninquiries, investigations, or examinations\narising out of certain retail sales practices\nof the Company that were the subject of\nsettlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the\nOffice of the Los Angeles City Attorney\nannounced by the Company on September 8, 2016.\nThe Company has responded to requests from\ncertain of the foregoing. As previously\ndisclosed, the Company entered into agreements\nto resolve the state attorneys general\ninvestigations. On February 21, 2020, the\nCompany entered into an agreement with the\nDepartment of Justice to resolve the\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s criminal investigation\ninto the Company\u2019s retail sales practices, as\nwell as a separate agreement to resolve the\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s civil investigation.\nAs part of the Department of Justice criminal\nsettlement, no charges will be filed against\nthe Company provided the Company abides by all\nthe terms of the agreement. The Department of\nJustice criminal settlement also includes the\nCompany\u2019s agreement that the facts set forth\nin the settlement document constitute\nsufficient facts for the finding of criminal\nviolations of statutes regarding bank records\nand personal information.On February 21, 2020,\nthe Company also entered into an order to\nresolve the SEC\u2019s investigation arising out of\nthe Company\u2019s retail sales practices. The SEC\norder contains a finding, to which the Company\nconsented, that the facts set forth include\nviolations of Section 10(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\nthereunder.As part of the resolution of the\nDepartment of Justice and SEC investigations,\nthe Company made payments totaling $\n3.0billion. In addition, as part of the\nsettlements and included in the $ 3.0billion\namount, the Company agreed to the creation of\na $ 500million Fair Fund for the benefit of\ninvestors who were harmed by the conduct\ncovered in the SEC settlement. In addition, a\nnumber of lawsuits were filed by non-\ngovernmental parties seeking damages or other\nremedies related to these retail sales\npractices. As previously disclosed, the\nCompany entered into various settlements to\nresolve these lawsuits. RMBS TRUSTEE\nLITIGATION In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF\nLimited and certain related entities and the\nNational Credit Union Administration (NCUA)\nfiled complaints in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York\nagainst Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., alleging\nclaims against the Company in its capacity as\ntrustee for a number of residential mortgage-\nbacked securities trusts. Complaints raising\nsimilar allegations have been filed by\nCommerzbank AG in the Southern District of New\nYork and by IKB International and IKB Deutsche\nIndustriebank in New York state court. In each\ncase, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to\ninvestors, and plaintiffs assert causes of\naction based upon, among other things, the\ntrustee\u2019s alleged failure to notify and\nenforce repurchase obligations of mortgage\nloan sellers for purported breaches of\nrepresentations and warranties, notify\ninvestors of alleged events of default, and\nabide by appropriate standards of care\nfollowing alleged events of default. The\nCompany previously settled twoclass actions\nwith similar allegations that were filed in\nNovember 2014 and December 2016 by\ninstitutional investors in the Southern\nDistrict of New York and New York state court,\nrespectively. In addition, Park Royal I LLC\nand Park Royal II LLC have filed complaints in\nNew York state court alleging Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A., as trustee, failed to take\nappropriate actions upon learning of defective\nmortgage loan documentation. In March 2021,\nthe Company entered into an agreement to\nresolve the case filed by the NCUA. SEMINOLE\nTRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION The Seminole Tribe of\nFlorida filed a complaint in Florida state\ncourt alleging that Wells Fargo, as trustee,\ncharged excess fees in connection with the\nadministration of a minor\u2019s trust and failed\nto invest the assets of the trust prudently.\nThe complaint was later amended to include\nthreeindividual current and former\nbeneficiaries as plaintiffs and to remove the\nTribe as a party to the case. In December\n2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss\nthe amended complaint on the grounds that the\nTribe is a necessary party and that the\nindividual beneficiaries lack standing to\nbring claims. The motion was denied in June\n2018. The case is pending trial.\n                                \n  114    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nOUTLOOK As described\nabove, the Company\nestablishes accruals\nfor legal actions when\npotential losses\nassociated with the\nactions become\nprobable and the costs\ncan be reasonably\nestimated. The high\nend of the range of\nreasonably possible\npotential losses in\nexcess of the\nCompany\u2019s accrual for\nprobable and estimable\nlosses was\napproximately $\n3.0billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2021.\nThe outcomes of legal\nactions are\nunpredictable and\nsubject to significant\nuncertainties, and it\nis inherently\ndifficult to determine\nwhether any loss is\nprobable or even\npossible. It is also\ninherently difficult\nto estimate the amount\nof any loss and there\nmay be matters for\nwhich a loss is\nprobable or reasonably\npossible but not\ncurrently estimable.\nAccordingly, actual\nlosses may be in\nexcess of the\nestablished accrual or\nthe range of\nreasonably possible\nloss. Based on\ninformation currently\navailable, advice of\ncounsel, available\ninsurance coverage,\nand established\nreserves, Wells Fargo\nbelieves that the\neventual outcome of\nthe actions against\nWells Fargo and/or its\nsubsidiaries will not,\nindividually or in the\naggregate, have a\nmaterial adverse\neffect on Wells\nFargo\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial condition.\nHowever, it is\npossible that the\nultimate resolution of\na matter, if\nunfavorable, may be\nmaterial to Wells\nFargo\u2019s results of\noperations for any\nparticular period.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    115  \n                                \n                       \n  Note 14:Derivatives  \n                       \nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to\nmarket risk, including interest rate risk,\ncredit risk and foreign currency risk, and to\nassist customers with their risk management\nobjectives. We designate certain derivatives\nas hedging instruments in qualifying hedge\naccounting relationships (fair value or cash\nflow hedges). Our remaining derivatives\nconsist of economic hedges that do not qualify\nfor hedge accounting and derivatives held for\ncustomer accommodation trading or other\npurposes. For additional information on our\nderivative activities, see Note 16\n(Derivatives) in our 2020 Form 10-K. Table\n14.1 presents the total notional or\ncontractual amounts and fair values for our\nderivatives. Derivative transactions can be\nmeasured in terms of the notional amount, but\nthis amount is not recorded on our\nconsolidated balance sheet and is not, when\nviewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of\nthe risk profile of the instruments. The\nnotional amount is generally not exchanged,\nbut is used only as the basis on which\ninterest and other payments are determined.\nTable 14.1: Notional or Contractual Amounts\nand Fair Values of Derivatives\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2014    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \nTable 14.2 provides information on the gross\nfair values of derivative assets and\nliabilities, the balance sheet netting\nadjustments and the resulting net fair value\namount recorded on our consolidated balance\nsheet, as well as the non-cash collateral\nassociated with such arrangements. We execute\nsubstantially all of our derivative\ntransactions under master netting arrangements\nand reflect all derivative balances and\nrelated cash collateral subject to enforceable\nmaster netting arrangements on a net basis\nwithin the consolidated balance sheet. The\n\u201cGross amounts recognized\u201d column in the\nfollowing table includes $ 54.2billion and $\n42.5billion of gross derivative assets and\nliabilities, respectively, at September 30,\n2021, and $ 54.6billion and $ 50.1billion,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2020, with\ncounterparties subject to enforceable master\nnetting arrangements that are eligible for\nbalance sheet netting adjustments. The\nremaining gross derivative assets and\nliabilities of $ 7.7billion and $ 4.6billion,\nrespectively, at September 30, 2021, and $\n11.1billion and $ 8.0billion, respectively, at\nDecember 31, 2020, include those with\ncounterparties subject to master netting\narrangements for which we have not assessed\nthe enforceability because they are with\ncounterparties where we do not currently have\npositions to offset, those subject to master\nnetting arrangements where we have not been\nable to confirm the enforceability and those\nnot subject to master netting arrangements. As\nsuch, we do not net derivative balances or\ncollateral within the consolidated balance\nsheet for these counterparties. Cash\ncollateral receivables and payables that have\nnot been offset against our derivatives were $\n3.4billion and $ 1.2billion, respectively, at\nSeptember 30, 2021, and $ 1.8billion and $\n984million, respectively, at December 31,\n2020. We determine the balance sheet netting\nadjustments based on the terms specified\nwithin each master netting arrangement. We\ndisclose the balance sheet netting amounts\nwithin the column titled \u201cGross amounts offset\nin consolidated balance sheet.\u201d Balance sheet\nnetting adjustments are determined at the\ncounterparty level for which there may be\nmultiple contract types. For disclosure\npurposes, we allocate these netting\nadjustments to the contract type for each\ncounterparty\n                                \n  116    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nproportionally based upon the \u201cGross amounts\nrecognized\u201d by counterparty. As a result, the\nnet amounts disclosed by contract type may not\nrepresent the actual exposure upon settlement\nof the contracts. We do not net non-cash\ncollateral that we receive and pledge on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. For disclosure\npurposes, we present the fair value of this\nnon-cash collateral in the column titled\n\u201cGross amounts not offset in consolidated\nbalance sheet (Disclosure-only netting)\u201d\nwithin the table. We determine and allocate\nthe Disclosure-only netting amounts in the\nsame manner as balance sheet netting amounts.\nThe \u201cNet amounts\u201d column within Table 14.2\nrepresents the aggregate of our net exposure\nto each counterparty after considering the\nbalance sheet and Disclosure-only netting\nadjustments. We manage derivative exposure by\nmonitoring the credit risk associated with\neach counterparty using counterparty-specific\ncredit risk limits, using master netting\narrangements and obtaining collateral.\nDerivative contracts executed in OTC markets\ninclude bilateral contractual arrangements\nthat are not cleared through a central\nclearing organization but are typically\nsubject to master netting arrangements. The\nproportion of these derivative contracts\nrelative to our total derivative assets and\nliabilities are presented in the \u201cPercent\nexchanged in over-the-counter market\u201d column\nin Table 14.2. In addition to the netting\namounts included in the table, we also have\nbalance sheet netting related to resale and\nrepurchase agreements that are disclosed\nwithin Note 12 (Pledged Assets and\nCollateral).\n\nTable 14.2: Gross Fair Values of Derivative\nAssets and Liabilities\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n                                              \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n                                              \n(1) Represents amounts with counterparties\nsubject to enforceable master netting\narrangements that have been offset in the\nconsolidated balance sheet, including related\ncash collateral and portfolio level\ncounterparty valuation adjustments.\nCounterparty valuation adjustments related to\nderivative assets were $ 273million and $\n399million and debit valuation adjustments\nrelated to derivative liabilities were $\n154million and $ 201million as of September\n30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nCash collateral totaled $ 5.4billion and $\n4.8billion, netted against derivative assets\nand liabilities, respectively, at September\n30, 2021, and $ 5.5billion and $ 7.5billion,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2020.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    117  \n                                \n                                              \n  Note 14:Derivatives(continued)              \n                                              \nFair Value and Cash Flow Hedges For fair value\nhedges, we use interest rate swaps to convert\ncertain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and\ntime certificates of deposit to floating rates\nto hedge our exposure to interest rate risk.\nWe also enter into cross-currency swaps,\ncross-currency interest rate swaps and forward\ncontracts to hedge our exposure to foreign\ncurrency risk and interest rate risk\nassociated with the issuance of non-U.S.\ndollar denominated long-term debt. In\naddition, we use interest rate swaps, cross-\ncurrency swaps, cross-currency interest rate\nswaps and forward contracts to hedge against\nchanges in fair value of certain investments\nin available-for-sale debt securities due to\nchanges in interest rates, foreign currency\nrates, or both. For certain fair value hedges\nof foreign currency risk, changes in fair\nvalue of cross-currency swaps attributable to\nchanges in cross-currency basis spreads are\nexcluded from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and recorded in other\ncomprehensive income. See Note 21 (Other\nComprehensive Income) for the amounts\nrecognized in other comprehensive income. For\ncash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps\nto hedge the variability in interest payments\nreceived on certain floating- rate commercial\nloans and paid on certain floating-rate debt\ndue to changes in the contractually specified\ninterest rate. We also use cross-currency\nswaps to hedge variability in interest\npayments on fixed-rate foreign currency-\ndenominated long-term debt due to changes in\nforeign exchange rates. We estimate $\n52million pre-tax of deferred net losses\nrelated to cash flow hedges in OCI at\nSeptember 30, 2021, will be reclassified into\nnet interest income during the next twelve\nmonths. The deferred losses expected to be\nreclassified into net interest income are\npredominantly related to discontinued hedges\nof floating rate loans. For cash flow hedges\nas of September 30, 2021, we are hedging our\nforeign currency exposure to the variability\nof future cash flows for all forecasted\ntransactions for a maximum of 9years. For\nadditional information on our accounting\nhedges, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies).

We use credit\nderivatives to assist customers with their\nrisk management objectives. We may also use\ncredit derivatives in structured product\ntransactions or liquidity agreements written\nto special purpose vehicles. The maximum\nexposure of sold credit derivatives is managed\nthrough posted collateral, purchased credit\nderivatives and similar products in order to\nachieve our desired credit risk profile. This\ncredit risk management provides an ability to\nrecover a significant portion of any amounts\nthat would be paid under sold credit\nderivatives. We would be required to perform\nunder the sold credit derivatives in the event\nof default by the referenced obligors. Events\nof default include events such as bankruptcy,\ncapital restructuring or lack of principal\nand/or interest payment. In certain cases,\nother triggers may exist, such as the credit\ndowngrade of the referenced obligors or the\ninability of the special purpose vehicle for\nwhich we have provided liquidity to obtain\nfunding.

We believe\nthis hypothetical\ncircumstance to be an\nextremely remote\npossibility and\naccordingly, this\nrequired disclosure is\nnot an indication of\nexpected loss. The\namounts under non-\ninvestment grade\nrepresent the notional\namounts of those\ncredit derivatives on\nwhich we have a higher\nrisk of being required\nto perform under the\nterms of the credit\nderivative and are a\nfunction of the\nunderlying assets. We\nconsider the risk of\nperformance to be high\nif the underlying\nassets under the\ncredit derivative have\nan external rating\nthat is below\ninvestment grade or an\ninternal credit\ndefault grade that is\nequivalent thereto. We\nbelieve the net\nprotection sold, which\nis representative of\nthe net notional\namount of protection\nsold and purchased\nwith identical\nunderlyings, in\ncombination with other\nprotection purchased,\nis more representative\nof our exposure to\nloss than either non-\ninvestment grade or\nprotection sold. Other\nprotection purchased\nrepresents additional\nprotection, which may\noffset the exposure to\nloss for protection\nsold, that was not\npurchased with an\nidentical underlying\nof the protection\nsold.\n\nCredit-Risk Contingent\nFeatures Certain of\nour derivative\ncontracts contain\nprovisions whereby if\nthe credit rating of\nour debt were to be\ndowngraded by certain\nmajor credit rating\nagencies, the\ncounterparty could\ndemand additional\ncollateral or require\ntermination or\nreplacement of\nderivative instruments\nin a net liability\nposition.

Assets and liabilities recorded\nat fair value on a recurring basis, such as\nderivatives, residential MSRs, and trading or\nAFS debt securities, are presented in Table\n15.1 in this Note. Additionally, from time to\ntime, we record fair value adjustments on a\nnonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring\nadjustments typically involve application of\nlower of cost or fair value (LOCOM)\naccounting, write-downs of individual assets\nor application of the measurement alternative\nfor nonmarketable equity securities. Assets\nrecorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nare presented in Table 15.4 in this Note. We\nprovide in Table 15.8 estimates of fair value\nfor financial instruments that are not\nrecorded at fair value, such as loans and debt\nliabilities carried at amortized cost. See\nNote 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies) in our 2020 Form 10-K for discussion\nof how we determine fair value. For\ndescriptions of the valuation methodologies we\nuse for assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value on a recurring or nonrecurring\nbasis, see Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and\nLiabilities) in our 2020 Form 10-K. FAIR VALUE\nHIERARCHY We classify our assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair value as either\nLevel 1, 2, or 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to\nvaluations based on unadjusted quoted prices\nin active markets and the lowest priority\n(Level 3) is assigned to valuations based on\nsignificant unobservable inputs. See Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies)\nin our 2020 Form 10-K for a detailed\ndescription of the fair value hierarchy. In\nthe determination of the classification of\nfinancial instruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy, we consider all\navailable information, including observable\nmarket data, indications of market liquidity\nand orderliness, and our understanding of the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs\nused.

We recognize settlement losses for our\nCash Balance Plan based on an assessment of\nwhether lump sum benefit payments will, in\naggregate for the year, exceed the sum of its\nannual service and interest cost (threshold).\nSettlement losses of $ 35million and $\n97million were recognized during the third\nquarter and first nine months of 2021,\nrespectively, compared with $ 29million and $\n99million, respectively, for the same periods\na year ago, representing the pro rata portion\nof the net loss in cumulative other\ncomprehensive income based on the percentage\nreduction in the Cash Balance Plan\u2019s projected\nbenefit obligation attributable to lump sum\nbenefit payments during the first nine months\nof both 2021 and 2020. As a result of the\nsettlement losses, we remeasured the Cash\nBalance Plan obligation and plan assets as of\nboth September 30, 2021 and 2020, and used a\ndiscount rate of 2.80% and 2.60%,\nrespectively, based on our consistent\nmethodology of determining our discount rate\nusing a yield curve with maturity dates that\nclosely match the estimated timing of the\nexpected benefit payments. In the third\nquarter and first nine months of 2021,\nrespectively, the result of the settlement\nlosses and remeasurement was: \u2022 a decrease of\n$ 224million and an increase of $ 123million\nin the Cash Balance Plan asset; and \u2022 a\ndecrease of $ 189million and an increase of $\n220million in other comprehensive income (pre-\ntax). In the third quarter and first nine\nmonths of 2020, respectively, the result of\nthe settlement losses and remeasurement was: \u2022\nan increase of $ 89million and $ 763million in\nthe Cash Balance Plan liability; and \u2022 a\ndecrease of $ 60million and $ 664million in\nother comprehensive income (pre-tax).

                     \nOur management reporting is organized into\nfourreportable operating segments: Consumer\nBanking and Lending; Commercial Banking;\nCorporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth\nand Investment Management. All other business\nactivities that are not included in the\nreportable operating segments have been\nincluded in Corporate. We define our\nreportable operating segments by type of\nproduct and customer segment, and their\nresults are based on our management reporting\nprocess. The management reporting process\nmeasures the performance of the reportable\noperating segments based on the Company\u2019s\nmanagement structure, and the results are\nregularly reviewed by our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Operating Committee. The\nmanagement reporting process is based on U.S.\nGAAP and includes specific adjustments, such\nas funds transfer pricing for asset/liability\nmanagement, shared revenues and expenses, and\ntaxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently\nreflect income from taxable and tax-exempt\nsources, which allows management to assess\nperformance consistently across the operating\nsegments. Consumer Banking and Lending offers\ndiversified financial products and services\nfor consumers and small businesses with annual\nsales generally up to $ 5million. These\nfinancial products and services include\nchecking and savings accounts, credit and\ndebit cards, as well as home, auto, personal,\nand small business lending. Commercial Banking\nprovides financial solutions to private,\nfamily owned and certain public companies.\nProducts and services include banking and\ncredit products across multiple industry\nsectors and municipalities, secured lending\nand lease products, and treasury management.\nCorporate and Investment Banking delivers a\nsuite of capital markets, banking, and\nfinancial products and services to corporate,\ncommercial real estate, government and\ninstitutional clients globally. Products and\nservices include corporate banking, investment\nbanking, treasury management, commercial real\nestate lending and servicing, equity and fixed\nincome solutions, as well as sales, trading,\nand research capabilities. Wealth and\nInvestment Management provides personalized\nwealth management, investment and retirement\nproducts and services to clients across\nU.S.-based businesses including Wells Fargo\nAdvisors and The Private Bank. We serve\nclients\u2019 brokerage needs, and deliver\nfinancial planning, private banking, credit,\nand fiduciary services to high-net worth and\nultra-high-net worth individuals and families.\nCorporate includes corporate treasury and\nenterprise functions, net of allocations\n(including funds transfer pricing, capital,\nliquidity and certain expenses), in support of\nthe reportable operating segments, as well as\nour investment portfolio and affiliated\nventure capital and private equity businesses.\nIn addition, Corporate includes all\nrestructuring charges related to our\nefficiency initiatives. See Note 19\n(Restructuring Charges) for additional\ninformation on restructuring charges.\nCorporate also includes certain lines of\nbusiness that management has determined are no\nlonger consistent with the long-term strategic\ngoals of the Company, as well as results for\npreviously divested businesses. Basis of\nPresentation FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING Corporate\ntreasury manages a funds transfer pricing\nmethodology that considers interest rate risk,\nliquidity risk, and other product\ncharacteristics. Operating segments pay a\nfunding charge for their assets and receive a\nfunding credit for their deposits, both of\nwhich are included in net interest income. The\nnet impact of the funding charges or credits\nis recognized in corporate treasury. REVENUE\nAND EXPENSE SHARING When lines of business\njointly serve customers, the line of business\nthat is responsible for providing the product\nor service recognizes revenue or expense with\na referral fee paid or an allocation of cost\nto the other line of business based on\nestablished internal revenue-sharing\nagreements. When a line of business uses a\nservice provided by another line of business\nor enterprise function (included in\nCorporate), expense is generally allocated\nbased on the cost and use of the service\nprovided. TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS\nTaxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-\nexempt income on certain loans and debt\nsecurities are included in net interest\nincome, while taxable-equivalent adjustments\nrelated to income tax credits for low-income\nhousing and renewable energy investments are\nincluded in noninterest income, in each case\nwith corresponding impacts to income tax\nexpense (benefit). Adjustments are included in\nCorporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate\nand Investment Banking and are eliminated to\nreconcile to the Company\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial results.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    143  \n                                \n                                              \n  Note 22:Operating Segments(continued)       \n                                              \nTable 22.1 presents our results by operating\nsegment.\nTable 22.1: Operating Segments\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                \n  144    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to\ntax-exempt income on certain loans and debt\nsecurities are included in net interest\nincome, while taxable-equivalent adjustments\nrelated to income tax credits for low-income\nhousing and renewable energy investments are\nincluded in noninterest income, in each case\nwith corresponding impacts to income tax\nexpense (benefit).

The\nFRB establishes capital requirements for the\nconsolidated financial holding company, and\nthe OCC has similar requirements for the\nCompany\u2019s national banks, including Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A. (the Bank). Table 23.1\npresents regulatory capital information for\nWells Fargo & Company and the Bank in\naccordance with Basel III capital\nrequirements. Our capital adequacy is assessed\nbased on the lower of our risk-based capital\nratios calculated under the Standardized\nApproach and under the Advanced Approach. The\nStandardized Approach applies assigned risk\nweights to broad risk categories, while the\ncalculation of risk-weighted assets (RWAs)\nunder the Advanced Approach differs by\nrequiring applicable banks to utilize a risk-\nsensitive methodology, which relies upon the\nuse of internal credit models, and includes an\noperational risk component. The Basel III\ncapital requirements for calculating Common\nEquity Tier 1 (CET1) and tier 1 capital, along\nwith RWAs, are fully phased-in. However, the\nrequirements for determining tier 2 and total\ncapital are still in accordance with\ntransition requirements and are scheduled to\nbe fully phased-in beginning January 1, 2022.\nAccordingly, the information presented below\nreflects fully phased-in CET1 capital, tier 1\ncapital, and RWAs, but reflects total capital\nstill in accordance with transition\nrequirements. At September 30, 2021, the Bank\nand our other insured depository institutions\nwere considered well-capitalized under the\nrequirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nAct.\nTable 23.1: Regulatory Capital Information (1)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n*Denotes the binding ratio based on the lower\ncalculation under the Advanced and\nStandardized Approaches.\n(1) At September 30, 2021, the impact of the\nCECL transition provision issued by federal\nbanking regulators on the regulatory capital\nof the Company was an increase in capital of $\n463million, reflecting a $ 991million (post-\ntax) increase in capital recognized upon our\ninitial adoption of CECL, offset by 25% of the\n$ 5.8billion increase in our ACL under CECL\nfrom January 1, 2020, through September 30,\n2021. The impact of the CECL transition\nprovision on the regulatory capital of the\nBank at September 30, 2021, was an increase in\ncapital of $ 463million.\n(2) RWAs for the Company and the Bank included\nan increase of $ 132million under the\nStandardized Approach and a decrease of $\n1.4billion under the Advanced Approach related\nto the impact of the CECL transition provision\non the excess allowance for credit losses as\nof September 30, 2021.\n(3) The SLR consists of tier 1 capital divided\nby total leverage exposure. Total leverage\nexposure consists of total average assets,\nless goodwill and other permitted tier 1\ncapital deductions (net of deferred tax\nliabilities), plus certain off-balance sheet\nexposures.\n(4) The tier 1 leverage ratio consists of tier\n1 capital divided by total average assets,\nexcluding goodwill and certain other items as\ndetermined under the rule.\nAt September 30, 2021, under transition\nrequirements, the CET1, tier 1 and total\ncapital ratio requirements for the Company\nincluded a global systemically important bank\n(G-SIB) surcharge of 2.00%. The G-SIB\nsurcharge is not applicable to the Bank. In\naddition, the CET1, tier 1 and total capital\nratio requirements for the Company and the\nBank included a stress capital buffer of 2.50%\nunder the Standardized Approach and a capital\nconservation buffer of 2.50% under the\nAdvanced Approach. The Company is required to\nmaintain these risk-based capital ratios and\nto maintain an SLR of at least 5.00%\n(comprised of a 3.00% minimum requirement plus\na supplementary leverage buffer of 2.00%) to\navoid restrictions on capital distributions\nand discretionary bonus payments. The Bank is\nrequired to maintain an SLR of at least 6.00%\nto be considered well-capitalized under\napplicable regulatory capital adequacy rules.\nTable 23.2 presents the risk-based capital and\nleverage requirements under transition\nrequirements to which the Company and the Bank\nwere subject as of September 30, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020,\nwhich were the same\nunder both the\nStandardized and\nAdvanced Approaches.\nTable 23.2: Risk-Based\nCapital and Leverage\nRatios \u2013 Transition\nRequirements\n                                              \n                                     Wells    \n                   Wells             Fargo    \n                   Fargo &           Bank,    \n                   Company           N.A.     \n                   Sep 30,           Sep 30,  \n                   2021              2021     \n                   and Dec           and Dec  \n                   31,               31,      \n                   2020              2020     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Common                                      \n  Equity     9.00  %           7.00           \n  Tier 1                                      \n  capit\u2026                                      \n  Tier 1    10.50              8.50           \n  capit\u2026                                      \n  Total     12.50             10.50           \n  capit\u2026                                      \n  Tier 1     4.00              4.00           \n  lever\u2026                                      \n  Suppl\u2026     5.00              6.00           \n  lever\u2026                                      \n                                              \n                                \n  146    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nCapital Planning\nRequirements The FRB\u2019s\nc apital plan rule\nestablishes capital\nplanning and other\nrequirements that\ngovern capital\ndistributions,\nincluding dividends\nand share repurchases,\nby certain large bank\nholding companies\n(BHCs), including\nWells Fargo.
