meaningful\n\n(1) Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is\ntotal revenue less noninterest expense.\nManagement believes that PTPP is a useful\nfinancial measure because it enables investors\nand others to assess the Company\u2019s ability to\ngenerate capital to cover credit losses\nthrough a credit cycle.\n\n(2) Book value per common share is common\nstockholders' equity divided by common shares\noutstanding. Tangible book value per common\nshare is tangible common equity divided by\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\n(3) Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure and represents total equity\nless preferred equity, noncontrolling\ninterests, goodwill, certain identifiable\nintangible assets (other than mortgage\nservicing rights) and goodwill and other\nintangibles on nonmarketable equity\nsecurities, net of applicable deferred taxes.\nThe methodology of determining tangible common\nequity may differ among companies. Management\nbelieves that return on average tangible\ncommon equity and tangible book value per\ncommon share, which utilize tangible common\nequity, are useful financial measures because\nthey enable management, investors, and others\nto assess the Company\u2019s use of equity. For\nadditional information, including a\ncorresponding reconciliation to generally\naccepted accounting principles (GAAP)\nfinancial measures, see the \u201cCapital\nManagement \u2013 Tangible Common Equity\u201d section\nin this Report.\n\n(4) Represents Wells Fargo net income (loss)\ndivided by average assets.\n\n(5) Represents Wells Fargo net income (loss)\napplicable to common stock divided by average\ncommon stockholders\u2019 equity.\n\n(6) The efficiency ratio is noninterest\nexpense divided by total revenue (net interest\nincome and noninterest income).\n\n(7) Beginning January 1, 2018, the\nrequirements for calculating common equity\ntier 1 (CET1) and tier 1 capital, along with\nrisk-weighted assets (RWAs), became fully\nphased-in. Accordingly, the information\npresented reflects fully phased-in CET1, tier\n1 capital, and RWAs, but reflects total\ncapital still in accordance with transition\nrequirements.

The Company is\nsubject to a number of\nconsent orders and\nother regulatory\nactions, which may\nrequire the Company,\namong other things, to\nundertake certain\nchanges to its\nbusiness, operations,\nproducts and services,\nand risk management\npractices. Addressing\nthese regulatory\nactions is expected to\ntake multiple years,\nand we may experience\nissues or delays along\nthe way in satisfying\ntheir requirements.\nIssues or delays with\none regulatory action\ncould affect our\nprogress on others,\nand failure to satisfy\nthe requirements of a\nregulatory action on a\ntimely basis could\nresult in additional\npenalties, enforcement\nactions, and other\nnegative consequences.\nWhile we still have\nsignificant work to\ndo, the Company is\ncommitted to devoting\nthe resources\nnecessary to operate\nwith strong business\npractices and\ncontrols, maintain the\nhighest level of\nintegrity, and have an\nappropriate culture in\nplace.\n\nFederal Reserve Board\nConsent Order\nRegarding Governance\nOversight and\nCompliance and\nOperational Risk\nManagement\n\nOn February 2, 2018,\nthe Company entered\ninto a consent order\nwith the Board of\nGovernors of the\nFederal Reserve System\n(FRB). As required by\nthe consent order, the\nCompany\u2019s Board of\nDirectors (Board)\nsubmitted to the FRB a\nplan to further\nenhance the Board\u2019s\ngovernance and\noversight of the\nCompany, and the\nCompany submitted to\nthe FRB a plan to\nfurther improve the\nCompany\u2019s compliance\nand operational risk\nmanagement program.\nThe Company continues\nto engage with the FRB\nas the Company works\nto address the consent\norder provisions. The\nconsent order also\nrequires the Company,\nfollowing the FRB\u2019s\nacceptance and\napproval of the plans\nand the Company\u2019s\nadoption and\nimplementation of the\nplans, to complete an\ninitial third-party\nreview of the\nenhancements and\nimprovements provided\nfor in the plans.\nUntil this third-party\nreview is complete\n\nand the plans are\napproved and\nimplemented to the\nsatisfaction of the\nFRB, the Company\u2019s\ntotal consolidated\nassets as defined\nunder the consent\norder will be limited\nto the level as of\nDecember 31, 2017.\nCompliance with this\nasset cap is measured\non a two-quarter daily\naverage basis to allow\nfor management of\ntemporary\nfluctuations. Due to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic,\non April 8, 2020, the\nFRB amended the\nconsent order to allow\nthe Company to exclude\nfrom the asset cap any\non-balance sheet\nexposure resulting\nfrom loans made by the\nCompany in connection\nwith the Small\nBusiness\nAdministration\u2019s\nPaycheck Protection\nProgram and the FRB\u2019s\nMain Street Lending\nProgram.

As of\nMarch 31, 2021, the\nCompany had not\nexcluded these\nexposures from the\nasset cap. After\nremoval of the asset\ncap, a second third-\nparty review must also\nbe conducted to assess\nthe efficacy and\nsustainability of the\nenhancements and\nimprovements.\n\nConsent Orders with\nthe Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau and\nOffice of the\nComptroller of the\nCurrency Regarding\nCompliance Risk\nManagement Program,\nAutomobile Collateral\nProtection Insurance\nPolicies, and Mortgage\nInterest Rate Lock\nExtensions\n\nOn April 20, 2018, the\nCompany entered into\nconsent orders with\nthe Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau\n(CFPB) and the Office\nof the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (OCC) to\npay an aggregate of $1\nbillion in civil money\npenalties to resolve\nmatters regarding the\nCompany\u2019s compliance\nrisk management\nprogram and past\npractices involving\ncertain automobile\ncollateral protection\ninsurance (CPI)\npolicies and certain\nmortgage interest rate\nlock extensions. As\nrequired by the\nconsent orders, the\nCompany submitted to\nthe CFPB and OCC an\nenterprise-wide\ncompliance risk\nmanagement plan and a\nplan to enhance the\nCompany\u2019s internal\naudit program with\nrespect to federal\nconsumer financial law\nand the terms of the\nconsent orders.

Our priority\nof rebuilding trust\nhas included numerous\nactions focused on\nidentifying potential\nfinancial harm to\ncustomers resulting\nfrom these matters and\nproviding remediation.\n\nFor additional\ninformation regarding\nretail sales practices\nmatters, including\nrelated legal matters,\nsee the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nsection in our 2020\nForm 10-K and Note 13\n(Legal Actions) to\nFinancial Statements\nin this Report.\n                                              \n  Other Customer Remediation Activities       \n                                              \nOur priority of\nrebuilding trust has\nalso included an\neffort to identify\nother areas or\ninstances where\ncustomers may have\nexperienced financial\nharm, provide\nremediation as\nappropriate, and\nimplement additional\noperational and\ncontrol procedures. We\nare working with our\nregulatory agencies in\nthis effort. We have\npreviously disclosed\nkey areas of focus as\npart of our rebuilding\ntrust efforts and are\nin the process of\nproviding remediation\nfor those matters. We\nhave accrued for the\nprobable and estimable\nremediation costs\nrelated to our\nrebuilding trust\nefforts, which amounts\nmay change based on\nadditional facts and\ninformation, as well\nas ongoing reviews and\ncommunications with\nour regulators.\n\nAs our ongoing reviews\ncontinue, it is\npossible that in the\nfuture we may identify\nadditional items or\nareas of potential\nconcern. To the extent\nissues are identified,\nwe will continue to\nassess any customer\nharm and provide\nremediation as\nappropriate.

For additional\ninformation on the\nderivatives used in\nthe economic hedges,\nsee Note 14\n(Derivatives) to\nFinancial Statements\nin this Report.\n\nTable 3a: Deferred\nCompensation and\nRelated Hedges\n                                              \n                      Quarter                 \n                      ended                   \n                      March                   \n  (in                 31,                     \n  millio\u2026             2021              2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Net                                         \n  intere\u2026    $     \u2014                12        \n  income                                      \n  Net                                         \n  losses                                      \n  from             \u2014              -621        \n  equity                                      \n  securi\u2026                                     \n  Total                                       \n  losses                                      \n  from                                        \n  deferr\u2026          \u2014              -609        \n  compen\u2026                                     \n  plan                                        \n  invest\u2026                                     \n  Decrea\u2026                                     \n  (incre\u2026                                     \n  in                                          \n  deferr\u2026       -165               598        \n  compen\u2026                                     \n  plan                                        \n  liabil\u2026                                     \n  Net                                         \n  deriva\u2026                                     \n  gains                                       \n  from                                        \n  econom\u2026        160                 \u2014        \n  hedges                                      \n  of                                          \n  deferr\u2026                                     \n  compen\u2026                                     \n  Decrea\u2026                                     \n  (incre\u2026                                     \n  in              -5               598        \n  person\u2026                                     \n  expense                                     \n  Loss                                        \n  before                                      \n  income     $    -5               -11        \n  tax                                         \n  expense                                     \n                                              \nTechnology,\ntelecommunications and\nequipment expense\nincreased due to\nhigher expense for\ntechnology contracts\nand higher\ntelecommunications\nexpense related to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOccupancy expense\nincreased due to\nadditional cleaning\nfees, supplies, and\nequipment expenses\nrelated to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOperating losses\ndecreased driven by\nlower expense for\nlitigation accruals\nand customer\nremediation accruals.\n\nProfessional and\noutside services\nexpense decreased\ndriven by reduced\nproject spending due\nto efficiency\ninitiatives.\n\nLease expense\ndecreased due to a\nreduction in the size\nof the operating lease\nasset portfolio.\n                              \n  Wells Fargo & Company    9  \n                              \n                                              \n  Earnings Performance(continued)             \n                                              \nAdvertising and\npromotion expense\ndecreased driven by\nreduced marketing and\nbrand campaign volumes\ndue to the impact of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRestructuring charges\nincreased related to\nour efficiency\ninitiatives that began\nin third quarter 2020.\nFor additional\ninformation on\nrestructuring charges,\nsee Note 19 (\nRestructuring Charges)\nto Financial\nStatements in this\nReport.\n\nOther expenses\nincreased driven by:\n\n\u2022 a write-down of\ngoodwill in first\nquarter 2021 related\nto the sale of a\nportion of our student\nloan portfolio;\n\n\u2022 higher charitable\ndonations expense\ndriven by the donation\nof PPP processing\nfees;

The\neffective income tax\nrate was 6.4% for\nfirst quarter 2021,\ncompared with 19.5%\nfor the same period a\nyear ago. Income tax\nexpense for first\nquarter 2021 included\nnet discrete income\ntax benefits of $154\nmillion related mainly\nto the resolution of\nprior period matters\nwith tax authorities.\nIncome tax expense for\nfirst quarter 2020\nincluded net discrete\nincome tax expense of\n$141 million driven by\nthe accounting for\nstock compensation\nactivity, the net\nimpact of accounting\nfor uncertain tax\npositions, and the\noutcome of U.S.\nfederal income tax\nexaminations.\n\nOperating Segment\nResults\n\nOur management\nreporting is organized\ninto four reportable\noperating segments:\nConsumer Banking and\nLending; Commercial\nBanking; Corporate and\nInvestment Banking;\nand Wealth and\nInvestment Management.\nAll other business\nactivities that are\nnot included in the\nreportable operating\nsegments have been\nincluded in Corporate.\nFor additional\ninformation, see Table\n4. We define our\nreportable operating\nsegments by type of\nproduct and customer\nsegment, and their\nresults are based on\nour management\nreporting process. The\nmanagement reporting\nprocess measures the\nperformance of the\nreportable operating\nsegments based on the\nCompany\u2019s management\nstructure, and the\nresults are regularly\nreviewed by our Chief\nExecutive Officer and\nOperating Committee.\nThe management\nreporting process is\nbased on U.S. GAAP and\nincludes specific\nadjustments, such as\nfunds transfer pricing\nfor asset/liability\nmanagement, shared\nrevenues and expenses,\nand taxable-equivalent\nadjustments to\nconsistently reflect\nincome from taxable\nand tax-exempt\nsources, which allows\nmanagement to assess\nperformance\nconsistently across\nthe operating\nsegments.\n\nIn February 2021, we\nannounced an agreement\nto sell Wells Fargo\nAsset Management and\nmoved the business\nfrom the Wealth and\nInvestment Management\noperating segment to\nCorporate. Prior\nperiod balances have\nbeen revised to\nconform with the\ncurrent period\npresentation.

Credit Risk\nManagement We define\ncredit risk as the\nrisk of loss\nassociated with a\nborrower or\ncounterparty default\n(failure to meet\nobligations in\naccordance with agreed\nupon terms). Credit\nrisk exists with many\nof our assets and\nexposures such as debt\nsecurity holdings,\ncertain derivatives,\nand loans. The Board\u2019s\nRisk Committee has\nprimary oversight\nresponsibility for\ncredit risk. A Credit\nSubcommittee of the\nRisk Committee assists\nthe Risk Committee in\nproviding oversight of\ncredit risk. At the\nmanagement level,\nCredit Risk, which is\npart of IRM, has\noversight\nresponsibility for\ncredit risk.

Our credit risk\nmanagement oversight process is governed\ncentrally, but provides for direct management\nand accountability by our lines of business.\nOur overall credit process includes\ncomprehensive credit policies, disciplined\ncredit underwriting, frequent and detailed\nrisk measurement and modeling, extensive\ncredit training programs, and a continual loan\nreview and audit process. A key to our credit\nrisk management is adherence to a well-\ncontrolled underwriting process, which we\nbelieve is appropriate for the needs of our\ncustomers as well as investors who purchase\nthe loans or securities collateralized by the\nloans. Credit Quality Overview Credit quality\nin first quarter 2021 reflected continued\nimprovement in the economic environment. In\nparticular: \u2022 Nonaccrual loans were $8.1\nbillion at March 31, 2021, down from $8.7\nbillion at December 31, 2020. Commercial\nnonaccrual loans decreased to $4.2 billion at\nMarch 31, 2021, compared with $4.8 billion at\nDecember 31, 2020, and consumer nonaccrual\nloans declined to $3.8 billion at March 31,\n2021, compared with $3.9 billion at December\n31, 2020. Nonaccrual loans represented 0.93%\nof total loans at March 31, 2021, compared\nwith 0.98% at December 31, 2020. \u2022 Net loan\ncharge-offs as a percentage of our average\ncommercial and consumer loan portfolios were\n0.13% and 0.37%, respectively, in first\nquarter 2021, compared with 0.25% and 0.53% in\nfirst quarter 2020. \u2022 Loans that are not\ngovernment insured/guaranteed and 90 days or\nmore past due and still accruing were $269\nmillion and $598 million in our commercial and\nconsumer portfolios, respectively, at March\n31, 2021, compared with $78 million and $612\nmillion at December 31, 2020. \u2022 Our provision\nfor credit losses for loans was $(1.1) billion\nin first quarter 2021, compared with $3.8\nbillion for the same period a year ago. \u2022 The\nACL for loans decreased to $18.0 billion, or\n2.09% of total loans, at March 31, 2021,\ncompared with $19.7 billion, or 2.22%, at\nDecember 31, 2020. Additional information on\nour loan portfolios and our credit quality\ntrends follows.\n                               \n  26    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nCOVID-Related Lending\nAccommodations During\n2020, we provided\naccommodations to\ncustomers in response\nto the COVID-19\npandemic, including\npayment deferrals, and\nother expanded\nassistance for\nmortgage, credit card,\nauto, small business,\npersonal and\ncommercial lending\ncustomers. With the\nexception of\nresidential mortgage-\nrelated accommodation\nprograms, the COVID-\nrelated lending\naccommodations\ninstituted during 2020\nwere no longer offered\nas of December 31,\n2020. Residential\nmortgage accommodation\nprograms, which\ncontinued during first\nquarter 2021, offered\npayment deferrals for\nup to a total of 18\nmonths. Table 10\nsummarizes the unpaid\nprincipal balance\n(UPB) of consumer\nloans that received\naccommodations under\nloan modification\nprograms established\nto assist customers\nwith the economic\nimpact of the COVID-19\npandemic (COVID-\nrelated modifications)\nand that remained in a\ndeferral period as of\nMarch 31, 2021.\n\nBased on guidance in\nthe CARES Act and the\nI nteragency Statement\non Loan Modifications\nand Reporting for\nFinancial Institutions\nWorking with Customers\nAffected by the\nCoronavirus (Revised)\nissued by federal\nbanking regulators in\nApril 2020 (the\nInteragency\nStatement), both of\nwhich we elected to\napply, loan\nmodifications related\nto COVID-19 and that\nmeet certain other\ncriteria are exempt\nfrom troubled debt\nrestructuring (TDR)\nclassification.\nAdditionally, our\nelection to apply the\nTDR relief provided by\nthe CARES Act and the\nInteragency Statement\nimpacts our regulatory\ncapital ratios as\nthese loan\nmodifications\n\nrelated to COVID-19\nare not adjusted to a\nhigher risk-weighting\nnormally required with\nTDR classification. At\nMarch 31, 2021,\nsubstantially all\nresidential mortgage\nloans that were in a\ndeferral period,\nexcluding those that\nwere government\ninsured/guaranteed,\nmet the criteria for\nTDR relief and were\ntherefore not\nclassified as TDRs.\nFor additional\ninformation regarding\nthe TDR relief\nprovided by the CARES\nAct and the clarifying\nTDR accounting\nguidance from the\nInteragency Statement,\nsee Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial\nStatements in our 2020\nForm 10-K.\n\nCustomer payment\ndeferral activities\ninstituted in response\nto the COVID-19\npandemic could\ncontinue to delay the\nrecognition of net\ncharge-offs,\ndelinquencies, and\nnonaccrual status for\nthose customers who\nwould have otherwise\nmoved into past due or\nnonaccrual status.\nCustomer loans that\nare not further\nmodified upon exit\nfrom the deferral\nperiod may be placed\non nonaccrual status\nor charged-off in\naccordance with our\npolicies if customers\nare unable to resume\nmaking payments in\naccordance with the\ncontractual terms of\ntheir agreement.

The downside\nscenario assumed more\nsustained adverse\neconomic impacts\nresulting from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic,\ncompared with the base\nscenario. The downside\nscenario assumed U.S.\nreal GDP growth\n\nrates increasing in\nthe near term followed\nby a decline with a\nreturn to normalized\nlevels after 2023 and\na sustained elevation\nin the U.S.\nunemployment rate\nuntil late 2022. We\nconsidered within each\nscenario our\nexpectations for the\nimpact of customer\naccommodation\nactivity, as well as\nthe estimated impact\non certain industries\nthat we consider to be\ndirectly and most\nadversely affected by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn addition to\nquantitative\nestimates, we consider\nqualitative factors\nthat represent risks\ninherent in our\nprocesses and\nassumptions such as\neconomic environmental\nfactors, modeling\nassumptions and\nperform ance, and\nother subjective\nfactors, including\nindustry trends and\nemerging risk\nassessments. We also\nconsidered the\nsignificant\nuncertainty related to\nthe duration and\nseverity of the\neconomic impacts from\nthe COVID-19 pandemic\nand the incremental\nrisks to our loan\nportfolio.\n\nThe forecasted key\neconomic variables\nused in our estimate\nof the ACL for loans\nat March 31, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020, are\npresented in Table 27.\n                               \n  40    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 27: Forecasted\nKey Economic Variables\n                                              \n               2Q           4Q           2Q   \n               20\u2026          20\u2026          20\u2026  \n  Bl\u2026                                         \n  of                                          \n  ec\u2026                                         \n  sc\u2026                                         \n  (1\u2026                                         \n  U.\u2026                                         \n  un\u2026                                         \n  ra\u2026                                         \n  (2\u2026                                         \n  Dec                                         \n  31,     8.1          7.1          6.2       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Mar                                         \n  31,     6.2          6.5          7.0       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  U.\u2026                                         \n  re\u2026                                         \n  GDP                                         \n  (3\u2026                                         \n  Dec                                         \n  31,     5.5          4.5          4.0       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Mar                                         \n  31,     3.0         -1.1         -0.6       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Ho\u2026                                         \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  in\u2026                                         \n  (4\u2026                                         \n  Dec                                         \n  31,     1.7         -0.2          2.5       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Mar                                         \n  31,     9.2          1.0         -5.2       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Co\u2026                                         \n  re\u2026                                         \n  es\u2026                                         \n  as\u2026                                         \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  (4\u2026                                         \n  Dec                                         \n  31,    -9.2         -9.8         -5.3       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Mar                                         \n  31,     2.3         -10\u2026         -11\u2026       \n  20\u2026                                         \n                                              \n(1) Represents a weighting of the forecasted\neconomic variable inputs based on a weighting\nof 50% for the base and 50% for a downside\nscenario at both March 31, 2021, and December\n31, 2020.

Future\namounts of the ACL for loans will be based on\na variety of factors, including loan balance\nchanges, portfolio credit quality and mix\nchanges, and changes in general economic\nconditions and expectations (including for\nunemployment and GDP), among other factors. We\nobserved economic improvements in first\nquarter 2021; however, there remained\nsignificant uncertainty related to the length\nand severity of the economic impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the impact of other\nfactors that may influence the level of\neventual losses and corresponding requirements\nfor future amounts of the ACL, including the\nimpact of economic stimulus programs and\ncustomer accommodation activity. The COVID-19\npandemic could continue to impact the\nrecognition of credit losses in our loan\nportfolios and may result in increases in our\nACL, particularly if the impact on the economy\nworsens. We believe the ACL for loans of $18.0\nbillion at March 31, 2021, was appropriate to\ncover expected credit losses, including\nunfunded credit commitments, at that date. The\nentire allowance is available to absorb credit\nlosses from the total loan portfolio. The ACL\nfor loans is subject to change and reflects\nexisting factors as of the date of\ndetermination, including economic or market\nconditions and ongoing internal and external\nexamination processes. Due to the sensitivity\nof the ACL for loans to changes in the\neconomic and business environment, it is\npossible that we will incur incremental credit\nlosses not anticipated as of the balance sheet\ndate. Our process for determining the ACL is\ndiscussed in the \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\n\u2013 Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d section and\nNote 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial Statements in our 2020\nForm 10-K. LIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE LOAN\nREPURCHASE LOSSES For information on our\nrepurchase liability, see the \u201cRisk Management\n\u2013 Credit Risk Management \u2013 Liability For\nMortgage Loan Repurchase Losses\u201d section in\nour 2020 Form 10-K. RISKS RELATING TO\nSERVICING ACTIVITIES In addition to servicing\nloans in our portfolio, we act as servicer\nand/or master servicer of residential mortgage\nloans included in GSE-guaranteed mortgage\nsecuritizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage\nsecuritizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed\nmortgages and\n\nprivate label mortgage securitizations, as\nwell as for unsecuritized loans owned by\ninstitutional investors. As a servicer, we are\nrequired to advance certain delinquent\npayments of principal and interest on mortgage\nloans we service. The amount and timing of\nreimbursement of advances of delinquent\npayments vary by investor and the applicable\nservicing agreements. Due to continued\ncustomer requests for payment deferrals as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic, the amount of\nour servicing advances of principal and\ninterest remained elevated. The amount of\nthese advances may continue to increase if\nadditional payment deferrals are provided.\nPayment deferrals also delay the collection of\ncontractually specified servicing fees,\nresulting in lower net servicing income. Upon\ntransfer as servicer, we retain the option to\nrepurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization\npools, which becomes exercisable when three\nscheduled loan payments remain unpaid by the\nborrower. We generally repurchase these loans\nfor cash and as a result, our total\nconsolidated assets do not change. As a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, our repurchases of\nthese loans were elevated in 2020 but returned\nto more normalized levels in first quarter\n2021. Repurchased loans that regain current\nstatus or are otherwise modified in accordance\nwith applicable servicing guidelines may be\nincluded in future GNMA loan securitization\npools. However, in accordance with guidance\nissued by GNMA, certain loans repurchased\nafter June 30, 2020, are ineligible for\ninclusion in future GNMA loan securitization\npools until the borrower has timely made six\nconsecutive payments. This requirement may\ndelay our ability to resell loans into the\nsecuritization market. For additional\ninformation about the risks related to our\nservicing activities, see the \u201cRisk Management\n\u2013 Credit Risk Management \u2013 Risks Relating to\nServicing Activities\u201d section in our 2020 Form\n10-K. For additional information on mortgage\nbanking activities, see Note 9 (Mortgage\nBanking Activities) to Financial Statements in\nthis Report. Asset/Liability Management\nAsset/liability management involves\nevaluating, monitoring and managing interest\nrate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding.\nFor information on our oversight of\nasset/liability risks, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Asset/Liability Management\u201d\nsection in our 2020 Form 10-K. INTEREST RATE\nRISK Interest rate risk is created in our role\nas a financial intermediary for customers\nbased on investments such as loans and other\nextensions of credit and debt securities.\nInterest rate risk can have a significant\nimpact to our earnings. We are subject to\ninterest rate risk because: \u2022 assets and\nliabilities may mature or reprice at different\ntimes. If assets reprice faster than\nliabilities and interest rates are generally\nrising, earnings will initially increase; \u2022\nassets and liabilities may reprice at the same\ntime but by different amounts; \u2022 short-term\nand long-term market interest rates may change\nby different amounts. For example, the shape\nof the yield curve may affect yield for new\nloans and funding costs differently; \u2022 the\nremaining maturity for various assets or\nliabilities may shorten or lengthen as\ninterest rates change. For example, if long-\nterm mortgage interest rates increase sharply,\nMBS held in the debt securities portfolio may\npay down at a slower rate than anticipated,\nwhich could impact portfolio income; or\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    41  \n                               \nRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement ( continued\n)\n\n\u2022 interest rates may\nhave a direct or\nindirect effect on\nloan demand,\ncollateral values,\ncredit losses,\nmortgage origination\nvolume, and the fair\nvalue of MSRs and\nother financial\ninstruments.\nCurrently, our profile\nis such that we\nproject net interest\nincome will benefit\nfrom higher interest\nrates as our assets\nwould reprice faster\nand to a greater\ndegree than our\nliabilities, while in\nthe case of lower\ninterest rates, our\nassets would reprice\ndownward and to a\ngreater degree than\nour liabilities\nresulting in lower net\ninterest income. We\nassess interest rate\nrisk by comparing\noutcomes under various\nnet interest income\nsimulations using many\ninterest rate\nscenarios that differ\nin the direction of\ninterest rate changes,\nthe degree of change\nover time, the speed\nof change and the\nprojected shape of the\nyield curve. These\nsimulations require\nassumptions regarding\ndrivers of earnings\nand balance sheet\ncomposition such as\nloan originations,\nprepayment speeds on\nloans and debt\nsecurities, deposit\nflows and mix, as well\nas pricing strategies.\nOur most recent\nsimulations, as\npresented in Table 28,\nestimate net interest\nincome sensitivity\nover the next 12\nmonths using\ninstantaneous\nmovements across the\nyield curve with both\nlower and higher\ninterest rates\nrelative to our base\nscenario. Steeper and\nflatter scenarios\nmeasure non-parallel\nchanges in the yield\ncurve, with long-term\ninterest rates defined\nas all tenors three\nyears and longer\n(e.g., 10-year U.S.\nTreasury securities)\nand short-term\ninterest rates defined\nas all tenors less\nthan three years.\nWhere applicable, U.S.\ndollar interest rates\nare floored at 0.00%.\nThe following\ndescribes the\nsimulation assumptions\nfor the scenarios\npresented in Table 28:\n\u2022 Simulations are\ndynamic and reflect\nanticipated changes to\nour assets and\nliabilities. \u2022 Other\nmacroeconomic\nvariables that could\nbe correlated with the\nchanges in interest\nrates are held\nconstant. \u2022 Mortgage\nprepayment and\norigination\nassumptions vary\nacross scenarios and\nreflect only the\nimpact of the higher\nor lower interest\nrates. \u2022 Our base\nscenario deposit\nforecast incorporates\nmix changes consistent\nwith the base interest\nrate trajectory.\nDeposit mix is modeled\nto be the same as in\nthe base scenario\nacross the alternative\nscenarios.

For additional information on our\ntrading assets and liabilities, see Note 2\n(Trading Activities) to Financial Statements\nin this Report. We use the debt securities\nportfolio and exchange-traded and over-the-\ncounter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to\nmanage our interest rate exposures. See Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies),\nNote 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\nMaturity Debt Securities) and Note 14\n(Derivatives) to Financial Statements in our\n2020 Form 10-K for additional information.\nMORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK\nWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans,\nwhich subjects us to various risks, including\ncredit, liquidity and interest rate risks. For\nadditional information on mortgage banking\ninterest rate and market risk, see Note 9\n(Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial\nStatements in this Report and the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Asset/Liability Management \u2013\nMortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market\nRisk\u201d section in our 2020 Form 10-K. Hedging\nthe various sources of interest rate risk in\nmortgage banking is a complex process that\nrequires sophisticated modeling and constant\nmonitoring. There are several potential risks\nto earnings from mortgage banking related to\norigination volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs\nand associated hedging results, the\nrelationship and degree of volatility between\nshort-term and long-term interest rates, and\nchanges in servicing and foreclosures costs.\nWhile we attempt to balance our mortgage\nbanking interest rate and market risks, the\nfinancial instruments we use may not perfectly\ncorrelate with the values and income being\nhedged. MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of\npossible economic loss from adverse changes in\nmarket risk factors such as interest rates,\ncredit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity\nand commodity prices, and the risk of possible\nloss due to counterparty exposure. This\napplies to implied volatility risk, basis\nrisk, and market liquidity risk. It also\nincludes price risk in the trading book,\nmortgage servicing rights and the hedge\neffectiveness risk associated with the\nmortgage book, and impairment on private\nequity investments. For information on our\noversight of market risk, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Asset/Liability Management \u2013\nMarket Risk\u201d section in our 2020 Form 10-K.\nMARKET RISK \u2013 TRADING ACTIVITIES We engage in\ntrading activities to accommodate the\ninvestment and risk management activities of\nour customers and to execute economic hedging\nto manage certain balance sheet risks. These\ntrading activities predominantly occur within\nour CIB businesses and to a lesser extent\nother businesses of the Company. Debt\nsecurities held for trading, equity securities\nheld for trading, trading loans and trading\nderivatives are financial instruments used in\nour trading activities, and all are carried at\nfair value. Income earned on the financial\ninstruments used in our trading activities\ninclude net interest income, changes in fair\nvalue and realized gains and losses. Net\ninterest income earned from our trading\nactivities is reflected in the interest income\nand interest expense components of our\nconsolidated statement of income. Changes in\nfair value of the financial instruments used\nin our trading activities are reflected in net\ngains from trading activities. For additional\ninformation on the financial instruments used\nin our trading activities and the income from\nthese trading activities, see Note 2 (Trading\nActivities) to Financial Statements in this\nReport.\n                               \n  42    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nValue-at-risk (VaR) is\na statistical risk\nmeasure used to\nestimate the potential\nloss from adverse\nmoves in the financial\nmarkets. The Company\nuses VaR metrics\ncomplemented with\nsensitivity analysis\nand stress testing in\nmeasuring and\nmonitoring market\nrisk. For additional\ninformation on our\nmonitoring activities,\nsensitivity analysis\nand stress testing,\nsee the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Market\nRisk \u2013 Trading\nActivities\u201d section in\nour 2020 Form 10-K.\n\nTrading VaR is the\nmeasure used to\nprovide insight into\nthe market risk\nexhibited by the\nCompany\u2019s trading\npositions. The Company\ncalculates Trading VaR\nfor risk management\npurposes to establish\nline of business and\nCompany-wide risk\nlimits.\n\nTrading VaR is\ncalculated based on\nall trading positions\non our consolidated\nbalance sheet.\n\nTable 29 shows the\nCompany\u2019s Trading\nGeneral VaR by risk\ncategory. The increase\nin average Company\nTrading General VaR\nfor the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2021,\ncompared with the same\nperiod a year ago, was\ndriven by a greater\npresence of market\nvolatility in the\n12-month historical\nlookback window used\nto calculate average\nCompany Trading\nGeneral VaR for the\nquarter ended March\n31, 2021. Market\nvolatility was driven\nby the COVID-19\npandemic, in\nparticular, changes in\ninterest rate curves\nand a significant\nwidening of credit\nspreads.\n\nTable 29: Trading\n1-Day 99% General VaR\nby Risk Category\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) The period-end VaR\nwas less than the sum\nof the VaR components\ndescribed above, which\nis due to portfolio\ndiversification. The\ndiversification effect\narises because the\nrisks are not\nperfectly correlated\ncausing a portfolio of\npositions to usually\nbe less risky than the\nsum of the risks of\nthe positions alone.\nThe diversification\nbenefit is not\nmeaningful for low and\nhigh metrics since\nthey may occur on\ndifferent days.\n\nMARKET RISK \u2013 EQUITY\nSECURITIES We are\ndirectly and\nindirectly affected by\nchanges in the equity\nmarkets. We make and\nmanage direct\ninvestments in start-\nup businesses,\nemerging growth\ncompanies, management\nbuy-outs, acquisitions\nand corporate\nrecapitalizations. We\nalso invest in non-\naffiliated funds that\nmake similar private\nequity investments.\nFor additional\ninformation, see the\n\u201cRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Market\nRisk \u2013 Equity\nSecurities\u201d section in\nour 2020 Form 10-K.\n\nWe also have\nmarketable equity\nsecurities that\ninclude investments\nrelating to our\nventure capital\nactivities. The fair\nvalue changes in these\nmarketable equity\nsecurities are\nrecognized in net\nincome. For additional\ninformation, see Note\n6 (Equity Securities)\nto Financial\nStatements in this\nReport.\n\nChanges in equity\nmarket prices may also\nindirectly affect our\nnet income by (1) the\nvalue of third-party\nassets under\nmanagement and, hence,\nfee income, (2)\nborrowers whose\nability to repay\nprincipal and/or\ninterest may be\naffected by the stock\nmarket, or (3)\nbrokerage activity,\nrelated commission\nincome and other\nbusiness activities.\nEach business line\nmonitors and manages\nthese indirect risks.\n\nLIQUIDITY RISK AND\nFUNDING In the\nordinary course of\nbusiness, we enter\ninto contractual\nobligations that may\nrequire future cash\npayments, including\nfunding for customer\nloan requests,\ncustomer deposit\nmaturities and\nwithdrawals, debt\nservice, leases for\npremises and\nequipment, and other\ncash commitments. The\nobjective of effective\nliquidity management\nis to ensure that we\ncan meet our\ncontractual\nobligations and other\ncash commitments\nefficiently under both\nnormal operating\nconditions and under\nperiods of Wells\nFargo-specific and/or\nmarket stress. To help\nachieve this\nobjective, we monitor\nboth the consolidated\ncompany and the Parent\non a stand-alone basis\nto ensure that the\nParent is a source of\nstrength for its\nregulated,\n\ndeposit-taking banking\nsubsidiaries.

We are a\nmember of the FHLBs\nbased in Dallas, Des\nMoines and San\nFrancisco. FHLB\nmembers are required\nto maintain a minimum\ninvestment in capital\nstock of the\napplicable FHLB. The\nboard of directors of\neach FHLB can\n\nincrease the minimum\ninvestment\nrequirements in the\nevent it has concluded\nthat additional\ncapital is required to\nallow it to meet its\nown regulatory capital\nrequirements. Any\nincrease in the\nminimum investment\nrequirements outside\nof specified ranges\nrequires the approval\nof the Federal Housing\nFinance Agency.\nBecause the extent of\nany obligation to\nincrease our\ninvestment in any of\nthe FHLBs depends\nentirely upon the\noccurrence of a\n                               \n  46    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nfuture event, the\namount of any future\ninvestment in the\ncapital stock of the\nFHLBs is not\ndeterminable.\n                      \n  Capital Management  \n                      \nWe have an active\nprogram for managing\ncapital through a\ncomprehensive process\nfor assessing the\nCompany\u2019s overall\ncapital adequacy. Our\nobjective is to\nmaintain capital at an\namount commensurate\nwith our risk profile\nand risk tolerance\nobjectives, and to\nmeet both regulatory\nand market\nexpectations. We\nprimarily fund our\ncapital needs through\nthe retention of\nearnings net of both\ndividends and share\nrepurchases, as well\nas through the\nissuance of preferred\nstock and long- and\nshort-term debt.\nRetained earnings at\nMarch 31, 2021,\nincreased $3.9 billion\nfrom December 31,\n2020, predominantly as\na result of $4.7\nbillion of Wells Fargo\nnet income, partially\noffset by $755 million\nof common and\npreferred stock\ndividends. During\nfirst quarter 2021, we\nissued $724 million of\ncommon stock,\nsubstantially all of\nwhich was issued in\nconnection with\nemployee compensation\nand benefits,\nexcluding conversions\nof preferred shares.\nDuring first quarter\n2021, we repurchased\n17 million shares of\ncommon stock at a cost\nof $596 million. For\nadditional information\nabout capital\nplanning, including\nthe FRB\u2019s recent\nannouncement on\ncapital distributions,\nsee the \u201cCapital\nPlanning and Stress\nTesting\u201d section\nbelow.\n\nIn first quarter 2021,\nwe issued $4.6 billion\nof preferred stock and\nredeemed $4.5 billion\nof preferred stock.\nFor additional\ninformation, see Note\n16 (Preferred Stock)\nto Financial\nStatements in this\nReport.\n                                              \n  Regulatory Capital Requirements             \n                                              \nThe Company and each\nof our IDIs are\nsubject to various\nregulatory capital\nadequacy requirements\nadministered by the\nFRB and the OCC. Risk-\nbased capital rules\nestablish risk-\nadjusted ratios\nrelating regulatory\ncapital to different\ncategories of assets\nand off-balance sheet\nexposures as discussed\nbelow.\n\nRISK-BASED CAPITAL AND\nRISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS\nThe Company is subject\nto rules issued by\nfederal banking\nregulators to\nimplement Basel III\ncapital requirements\nfor U.S. banking\norganizations. The\nrules contain two\nframeworks for\ncalculating capital\nrequirements, a\nStandardized Approach\nand an Advanced\nApproach applicable to\ncertain institutions,\nincluding Wells Fargo.\nOur capital adequacy\nis assessed based on\nthe lower of our risk-\nbased capital ratios\ncalculated under the\ntwo approaches. The\nCompany is required to\nsatisfy the risk-based\ncapital ratio\nrequirements to avoid\nrestrictions on\ncapital distributions\nand discretionary\nbonus payments. Table\n35 and Table 36\npresent the risk-based\ncapital requirements\napplicable to the\nCompany on a fully\nphased-in basis under\nthe Standardized\nApproach and Advanced\nApproach,\nrespectively, as of\nMarch 31, 2021.\n\nTable 35: Risk-Based\nCapital Requirements \u2013\nStandardized Approach\n\nTable 36: Risk-Based\nCapital Requirements \u2013\nAdvanced Approach\n\nIn addition to the\nrisk-based capital\nrequirements described\nin Table 35 and Table\n36, if the FRB\ndetermines that a\nperiod of excessive\ncredit growth is\ncontributing to an\nincrease in systemic\nrisk, a\ncountercyclical buffer\nof up to 2.50% could\nbe added to the risk-\nbased capital ratio\nrequirements under\nfederal banking\nregulations.\n\nThe capital\nconservation buffer is\napplicable to certain\ninstitutions,\nincluding Wells Fargo,\nunder the Advanced\nApproach and is\nintended to absorb\nlosses during times of\neconomic or financial\nstress.\n\nThe stress capital\nbuffer is calculated\nbased on the decrease\nin a BHC\u2019s risk-based\ncapital ratios under\nthe severely adverse\nscenario in the FRB\u2019s\nannual supervisory\nstress test and\nrelated Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and\nReview (CCAR), plus\nfour quarters of\nplanned common stock\ndividends. Because the\nstress capital buffer\nis calculated annually\nbased on data that can\ndiffer over time, our\nstress capital buffer,\nand thus our risk-\nbased capital ratio\nrequirements under the\nStandardized Approach,\nare subject to change\nin future periods. The\nCompany\u2019s stress\ncapital buffer for the\nperiod October 1,\n2020, through\nSeptember 30, 2021, is\n2.50%.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    47  \n                               \n                                              \n  Capital Management(continued)               \n                                              \nAs a global\nsystemically important\nbank (G-SIB), we are\nalso subject to the\nFRB\u2019s rule\nimplementing an\nadditional capital\nsurcharge of between\n1.00-4.50% on the\nrisk-based capital\nratio requirements of\nG-SIBs. Under the\nrule, we must annually\ncalculate our\nsurcharge under two\nmethods and use the\nhigher of the two\nsurcharges. The first\nmethod (method one)\nconsiders our size,\ninterconnectedness,\ncross-jurisdictional\nactivity,\nsubstitutability, and\ncomplexity, consistent\nwith the methodology\ndeveloped by the BCBS\nand the Financial\nStability Board (FSB).\nThe second method\n(method two) uses\nsimilar inputs, but\nreplaces\nsubstitutability with\nuse of short-term\nwholesale funding and\nwill generally result\nin higher surcharges\nthan under method one.\nBecause the G-SIB\ncapital surcharge is\ncalculated annually\nbased on data that can\ndiffer over time, the\namount of the\nsurcharge is subject\nto change in future\nyears.\n\nThe Basel III capital\nrequirements for\ncalculating CET1 and\ntier 1 capital, along\nwith risk-weighted\nassets (RWAs), are\nfully phased-in.\nHowever, the\nrequirements for\ndetermining tier 2 and\ntotal capital are\nstill in accordance\nwith transition\nrequirements and are\nscheduled to be fully\nphased-in by the end\nof 2021.\n\nUnder the risk-based\ncapital rules, on-\nbalance sheet assets\nand credit equivalent\namounts of derivatives\nand off-balance sheet\nitems are assigned to\none of several broad\nrisk categories\naccording to the\nobligor, or, if\nrelevant, the\nguarantor or the\n\nnature of any\ncollateral. The\naggregate dollar\namount in each risk\ncategory is then\nmultiplied by the risk\nweight associated with\nthat category. The\nresulting weighted\nvalues from each of\nthe risk categories\nare aggregated for\ndetermining total\nRWAs.\n\nThe tables that follow\nprovide information\nabout our risk-based\ncapital and related\nratios as calculated\nunder Basel III\ncapital rules.\nAlthough we report\ncertain capital\namounts and ratios in\naccordance with\ntransition\nrequirements for bank\nregulatory reporting\npurposes, we manage\nour capital on a fully\nphased-in basis.

The ratios are\n(i) tangible book\nvalue per common\nshare, which\nrepresents tangible\ncommon equity divided\nby common shares\noutstanding; and (ii)\nreturn on average\ntangible common equity\n(ROTCE),\n\nwhich represents our\nannualized earnings as\na percentage of\ntangible common\nequity. The\nmethodology of\ndetermining tangible\ncommon equity may\ndiffer among\ncompanies.

Our long-term targeted capital\nstructure also considers capital levels\nsufficient to exceed capital requirements\nincluding the G-SIB capital surcharge.\nAccordingly, we currently target a long-term\nCET1 capital ratio at or in excess of 10.00%.\nOur capital targets are subject to change\nbased on various factors, including changes to\nthe regulatory capital framework and\nexpectations for large banks promulgated by\nbank regulatory agencies, changes to the\nregulatory requirements for our capital\nratios, planned capital actions, changes in\nour risk profile and other factors. The FRB\ncapital plan rule establishes capital planning\nand other requirements that govern capital\ndistributions, including dividends and share\nrepurchases, by certain BHCs, including Wells\nFargo. The FRB assesses, among other things,\nthe overall financial condition, risk profile,\nand capital adequacy of BHCs when evaluating\ntheir capital plans. We submitted our 2021\ncapital plan to the FRB on April 5, 2021. As\npart of the 2021 CCAR, the FRB also generated\na supervisory stress test. The FRB is expected\nto review the supervisory stress test results\nas required under the Dodd-Frank Act using a\ncommon set of capital actions for all large\nBHCs and is also expected to review the\nCompany\u2019s proposed capital actions. The FRB\nhas indicated it will publish its supervisory\nstress test results by July 1, 2021. On March\n25, 2021, the FRB announced that it was\nextending measures it previously announced\nlimiting large BHCs, including Wells Fargo,\nfrom making any capital distribution\n(excluding any capital distribution arising\nfrom the issuance of a capital instrument\neligible for inclusion in the numerator of a\nregulatory capital ratio), unless otherwise\napproved by the FRB. The FRB has generally\nauthorized BHCs to (i) provided that the BHC\ndoes not increase the amount of its common\nstock dividends to be larger than the level\npaid in second quarter 2020, pay common stock\ndividends and make share repurchases that, in\nthe aggregate, do not exceed an amount equal\nto the average of the BHC\u2019s net income for the\nfour preceding calendar quarters; (ii) make\nshare repurchases that equal the amount of\nshare issuances related to expensed employee\ncompensation; and (iii) redeem and make\nscheduled payments on additional tier 1 and\ntier 2 capital instruments. The FRB has also\nannounced that if a BHC remains above all of\nits minimum risk-based capital requirements in\nthis year's supervisory stress test, these\nadditional limitations on capital\ndistributions will end for that BHC after June\n30, 2021. However, a BHC that falls below any\nof its minimum risk-based capital requirements\nin this year's supervisory stress test will\nremain subject to the additional limitations\non capital distributions through September 30,\n2021, and if the BHC remains below the capital\nrequired by the supervisory stress test at\nthat time, the existing stress capital\n                               \n  52    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nbuffer framework will\nimpose even stricter\ncapital distribution\nlimitations.\n\nConcurrently with\nCCAR, federal banking\nregulators also\nrequire large BHCs and\nbanks to conduct their\nown stress tests to\nevaluate whether the\ninstitution has\nsufficient capital to\ncontinue to operate\nduring periods of\nadverse economic and\nfinancial conditions.\n                                              \n  Securities Repurchases                      \n                                              \nFrom time to time the\nBoard authorizes the\nCompany to repurchase\nshares of our common\nstock. Although we\nannounce when the\nBoard authorizes share\nrepurchases, we\ntypically do not give\nany public notice\nbefore we repurchase\nour shares. Various\nfactors determine the\namount of our share\nrepurchases, including\nour capital\nrequirements, the\nnumber of shares we\n\nexpect to issue for\nemployee benefit plans\nand acquisitions,\nmarket conditions\n(including the trading\nprice of our stock),\nand regulatory and\nlegal considerations,\nincluding under the\nFRB\u2019s capital plan\nrule. Due to the\nvarious factors that\nmay impact the amount\nof our share\nrepurchases and the\nfact that we tend to\nbe in the market\nregularly to satisfy\nrepurchase\nconsiderations under\nour capital plan, our\nshare repurchases\noccur at various price\nlevels. We may suspend\nshare repurchase\nactivity at any time.\n\nAt March 31, 2021, we\nhad remaining Board\nauthority to\nrepurchase\napproximately 650\nmillion shares,\nsubject to regulatory\nand legal conditions.\nFor additional\ninformation about\nshare repurchases\nduring first quarter\n2021, see Part II,\nItem 2 in this Report.\n                      \n  Regulatory Matters  \n                      \nThe U.S. financial\nservices industry is\nsubject to significant\nregulation and\nregulatory oversight\ninitiatives. This\nregulation and\noversight may continue\nto impact how U.S.\nfinancial services\ncompanies conduct\nbusiness and may\ncontinue to result in\nincreased regulatory\ncompliance costs.\n\nFor a discussion of\ncertain consent orders\napplicable to the\nCompany, see the\n\u201cOverview\u201d section in\nthis Report.

We provide\nbanking, investment and mortgage products and\nservices, as well as consumer and commercial\nfinance, through banking locations and\noffices, the internet and other distribution\nchannels to individuals, businesses and\ninstitutions in all 50 states, the District of\nColumbia, and in countries outside the U.S.\nWhen we refer to \u201cWells Fargo,\u201d \u201cthe Company,\u201d\n\u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus,\u201d we mean Wells Fargo &\nCompany and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells\nFargo & Company (the Parent) is a financial\nholding company and a bank holding company. We\nalso hold a majority interest in a real estate\ninvestment trust, which has publicly traded\npreferred stock outstanding. Our accounting\nand reporting policies conform with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP) and practices in the financial services\nindustry. For discussion of our significant\naccounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 (2020 Form 10-K). There were\nno material changes to these policies in first\nquarter 2021. To prepare the financial\nstatements in conformity with GAAP, management\nmust make estimates based on assumptions about\nfuture economic and market conditions (for\nexample, unemployment, market liquidity, real\nestate prices, etc.) that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities at the date\nof the financial statements, income and\nexpenses during the reporting period and the\nrelated disclosures. Although our estimates\ncontemplate current conditions and how we\nexpect them to change in the future, it is\nreasonably possible that actual conditions\ncould be worse than anticipated in those\nestimates, which could materially affect our\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nManagement has made significant estimates in\nseveral areas, including: \u2022 allowance for\ncredit losses (Note 4 (Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit Losses)); \u2022 valuations of\nresidential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)\n(Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities) and Note 9 (Mortgage Banking\nActivities)); \u2022 valuations of financial\ninstruments (Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets\nand Liabilities)); \u2022 liabilities for\ncontingent litigation losses (Note 13 (Legal\nActions)); \u2022 income taxes; and \u2022 goodwill\nimpairment (Note 10 (Intangible Assets)).\nActual results could differ from those\nestimates. These unaudited interim financial\nstatements reflect all adjustments that are,\nin the opinion of management, necessary for a\nfair statement of the results for the periods\npresented. These adjustments are of a normal\nrecurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed\nin this Form 10-Q. The results of operations\nin the interim financial statements do not\nnecessarily indicate the results that may be\nexpected for the full year. The interim\nfinancial information should be read in\nconjunction with our 2020 Form 10-K.\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2021 In first\nquarter 2021, we adopted the following new\naccounting guidance: \u2022 Accounting Standards\nUpdate (ASU or Update) 2021-01 \u2013 Reference\nRate Reform (Topic 848): Scope \u2022 ASU 2020-08 \u2013\nCodification Improvements to Subtopic 310-20,\nReceivables \u2013 Nonrefundable Fees and Other\nCosts \u2022 ASU 2020-01 \u2013 Investments \u2013 Equity\nSecurities (Topic 321), Investments \u2013 Equity\nMethod and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and\nDerivatives and Hedging (Topic 815):\nClarifying the Interactions between Topic 321,\nTopic 323, and Topic 815 (a consensus of the\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)\nEmerging Issues Task Force) \u2022 ASU 2019-12 \u2013\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the\nAccounting for Income Taxes ASU 2021-01\nclarifies the scope of Topic 848 to include\nderivatives affected by changes in interest\nrates for margining, discounting, or contract\nprice alignment as part of the market-wide\ntransition to new reference rate (commonly\nreferred to as the \u201cdiscounting transition\u201d),\neven if they do not reference the London\nInterbank Offered Rate or another rate that is\nexpected to be discontinued as a result of\nreference rate reform. The guidance also\nclarifies other aspects of the relief provided\nin Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)\n848. We adopted ASU 2021-01 in first quarter\n2021, and the guidance will be followed until\nthe Update terminates on December 31, 2022.\nThis guidance is applied on a prospective\nbasis. The Update did not have a material\nimpact on our consolidated financial\nstatements. ASU 2020-08 clarifies the\naccounting for purchased callable debt\nsecurities carried at a premium and was issued\nto correct an unintended application of ASU\n2017-08 \u2013 Receivables\u2014Nonrefundable Fees and\nOther Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium\nAmortization on Purchased Callable Debt\nSecurities , which requires amortization of\nsuch premiums to the earliest call date, but\nwas not clear for the method to be used for\ninstruments with multiple call dates. This\nUpdate now specifies that such premiums are\namortized to the next call date and requires\nreassessment throughout the life of the\ninstruments with multiple call dates. The\nUpdate did not have an impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements, as we had\ninterpreted the provisions of ASU 2017-08 in\nthis manner upon our adoption in first quarter\n2019. ASU 2020-01 clarifies the accounting for\nequity securities upon transition between the\nmeasurement alternative and equity method. The\nUpdate also clarifies for forward contracts\nand options to purchase equity securities an\nentity need not consider whether upon\nsettlement of the forward contract or option\nif the equity securities would be accounted\nfor by the equity method or the fair value\noption. We adopted this Update in first\nquarter 2021. The Update did not have an\nimpact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.

The credit quality\nindicators that we most closely monitor\ninclude credit ratings and delinquency status\nand are based on information as of our\nfinancial statement date. CREDIT RATINGS\nCredit ratings express opinions about the\ncredit quality of a debt security. We\ndetermine the credit rating of a security\naccording to the lowest credit rating made\navailable by national recognized statistical\nrating organizations (NRSROs). Debt securities\nrated investment grade, that is those with\nratings similar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as\ndefined by NRSROs, are generally considered by\nthe rating agencies and market participants to\nbe low credit risk. Conversely, debt\nsecurities rated below investment grade,\nlabeled as \u201cspeculative grade\u201d by the rating\nagencies, are considered to be distinctively\nhigher credit risk than investment grade debt\nsecurities. For debt securities not rated by\nNRSROs, we determine an internal credit grade\nof the debt securities (used for credit risk\nmanagement purposes) equivalent to the credit\nratings assigned by major credit agencies.\nSubstantially all of our debt securities were\nrated by NRSROs at March 31, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020. Table 3.4 shows the\npercentage of fair value of AFS debt\nsecurities and amortized cost of HTM debt\nsecurities determined to be rated investment\ngrade, inclusive of securities rated based

are\ndelinquent in payment of amounts due under\ncontractual debt agreements have a higher\nprobability of recognition of credit losses.\nAs such, as part of our monitoring of the\ncredit quality of the debt security portfolio,\nwe consider whether debt securities we own are\npast due in payment of principal or interest\npayments and whether any securities have been\nplaced into nonaccrual status. Debt securities\nthat are past due and still accruing were\ninsignificant at both March 31, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020. The carrying value of debt\nsecurities in nonaccrual status was\ninsignificant at both March 31, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020. Charge-offs on debt\nsecurities were insignificant for the quarters\nended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Purchased debt\nsecurities with credit deterioration (PCD) are\nnot considered to be in nonaccrual status, as\npayments from issuers of these securities\nremain current. PCD securities were\ninsignificant during the quarters ended March\n31, 2021 and 2020.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    69  \n                               \nNote 3: Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\nMaturity Debt Securities (continued)\n\nUnrealized Losses of Available-for-Sale Debt\nSecurities Table 3.5 shows the gross\nunrealized losses and fair value of AFS debt\nsecurities by length of time those individual\nsecurities in each category have been in a\ncontinuous loss position.

Credit\nimpairment is recorded as an ACL for debt\nsecurities.

We\ngenerally require a\nfee to extend such\ncommitments. Certain\ncommitments are\nsubject to loan\nagreements with\ncovenants regarding\nthe financial\nperformance of the\ncustomer or borrowing\nbase formulas on an\nongoing basis that\nmust be met before we\nare required to fund\nthe commitment. We may\nreduce or cancel\nconsumer commitments,\nincluding home equity\nlines and credit card\nlines, in accordance\nwith the contracts and\napplicable law. For\nunconditionally\ncancelable commitments\nat our discretion, we\ndo not recognize an\nACL. We may, as a\nrepresentative for\nother lenders, advance\nfunds or provide for\nthe issuance of\nletters of credit\nunder syndicated loan\nor letter of credit\nagreements. Any\nadvances are generally\nrepaid in less than a\nweek and would\nnormally require\ndefault of both the\ncustomer and another\nlender to expose us to\nloss. The unfunded\namount of these\ntemporary advance\narrangements totaled\napproximately $\n81.9billion at March\n31, 2021. We issue\ncommercial letters of\ncredit to assist\ncustomers in\npurchasing goods or\nservices, typically\nfor international\ntrade. At both March\n31, 2021, and December\n31, 2020, we had $\n1.3billion, of\noutstanding issued\ncommercial letters of\ncredit. We also\noriginate multipurpose\nlending commitments\nunder which borrowers\nhave the option to\ndraw on the facility\nfor different purposes\nin one of several\nforms, including a\nstandby letter of\ncredit. See Note 11\n(Guarantees and Other\nCommitments) for\nadditional information\non standby letters of\ncredit. When we enter\ninto commitments, we\nare exposed to credit\nrisk. The maximum\ncredit risk for these\ncommitments will\ngenerally be lower\nthan the contractual\namount because a\nsignificant portion of\nthese commitments are\nnot funded. We manage\nthe potential risk in\ncommitments to lend by\nlimiting the total\namount of commitments,\nboth by individual\ncustomer and in total,\nby monitoring the size\nand maturity structure\nof these commitments\nand by applying the\nsame credit standards\nfor these commitments\nas for all of our\ncredit activities.\n\nFor loans and\ncommitments to lend,\nwe generally require\ncollateral or a\nguarantee. We may\nrequire various types\nof collateral,\nincluding commercial\nand consumer real\nestate, autos, other\nshort-term liquid\nassets such as\naccounts receivable or\ninventory and long-\nlived assets, such as\nequipment and other\nbusiness assets.\nCollateral\nrequirements for each\nloan or commitment may\nvary based on the loan\nproduct and our\nassessment of a\ncustomer\u2019s credit risk\naccording to the\nspecific credit\nunderwriting,\nincluding credit terms\nand structure.\nThe contractual amount\nof our unfunded credit\ncommitments, including\nunissued standby and\ncommercial letters of\ncredit, is summarized\nby portfolio segment\nand class of financing\nreceivable in Table\n4.4.

The\nfollowing sections provide the credit quality\nindicators we most closely monitor. The credit\nquality indicators are generally based on\ninformation as of our financial statement\ndate, with the exception of updated Fair Isaac\nCorporation (FICO) scores and updated loan-to-\nvalue (LTV)/combined LTV (CLTV). We obtain\nFICO scores at loan origination and the scores\nare generally updated at least quarterly,\nexcept in limited circumstances, including\ncompliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act\n(FCRA). Generally, the LTV and CLTV indicators\nare updated in the second month of each\nquarter, with updates no older than December\n31, 2020. COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS\nWe manage a consistent process for assessing\ncommercial loan credit quality. Generally,\ncommercial loans are subject to individual\nrisk assessment using our internal borrower\nand collateral quality ratings, which is our\nprimary credit quality indicator. Our ratings\nare aligned to regulatory definitions of pass\nand criticized categories with the criticized\nsegmented among special mention, substandard,\ndoubtful and loss categories. Table 4.7\nprovides the outstanding balances of our\ncommercial loan portfolio by risk category.\nCredit quality information is provided with\nthe year of origination for term loans.\nRevolving loans may convert to term loans as a\nresult of a contractual provision in the\noriginal loan agreement or if modified in a\ntroubled debt restructuring (TDR). At March\n31, 2021, we had $ 445.6billion and $\n31.9billion of pass and criticized commercial\nloans, respectively.\n\nTable 4.7: Commercial Loan Categories by Risk\nCategories and Vintage\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    77  \n                               \nNote 4: Loans and Related Allowance for Credit\nLosses (continued)\nTable 4.8 provides past due information for\ncommercial loans, which we monitor as part of\nour credit risk management practices; however,\ndelinquency is not a primary credit quality\nindicator for commercial loans.

principal balance to the property\u2019s\ncollateral value. CLTV refers to the\ncombination of first lien mortgage and junior\nlien mortgage (including unused line amounts\nfor credit line products) ratios. LTVs and\nCLTVs are updated quarterly using a cascade\napproach which first uses values provided by\nautomated valuation models (AVMs) for the\nproperty. If an AVM is not available, then the\nvalue is estimated using the original\nappraised value adjusted by the change in Home\nPrice Index (HPI) for the property location.\nIf an HPI is not available, the original\nappraised value is used. The HPI value is\nnormally the only method considered for high\nvalue properties, generally with an original\nvalue of $ 1million or more, as the AVM values\nhave proven less accurate for these\nproperties.\n                               \n  82    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 4.11 shows the most updated LTV and CLTV\ndistribution of the residential mortgage \u2013\nfirst lien and residential mortgage \u2013 junior\nlien loan portfolios.

We do not consider loan\nresolutions such as foreclosure or short sale\nto be a TDR. In addition, COVID-related\nmodifications are generally not classified as\nTDRs due to the relief under the CARES Act and\nthe Interagency Statement. For additional\ninformation on the TDR relief, see Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies)\nin our 2020 Form 10-K. We may require some\nconsumer borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty to make trial payments generally\nfor a period of three to four months,\naccording to the terms of a planned permanent\nmodification, to determine if they can perform\naccording to those terms. These arrangements\nrepresent trial modifications, which we\nclassify and account for as TDRs. While loans\nare in trial payment programs, their original\nterms are not considered modified and they\ncontinue to advance through delinquency status\nand accrue interest according to their\noriginal terms. Commitments to lend additional\nfunds on loans whose terms have been modified\nin a TDR amounted to $ 506million and $\n489million at March 31, 2021, and December 31,\n2020, respectively. Table 4.14 summarizes our\nTDR modifications for the periods presented by\nprimary modification type and includes the\nfinancial effects of these modifications. For\nthose loans that modify more than once, the\ntable reflects each modification that occurred\nduring the period. Loans that both modify and\nare paid off or written-off within the period,\nas well as changes in recorded investment\nduring the period for loans modified in prior\nperiods, are not included in the table.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    85  \n                               \nNote 4: Loans and Related Allowance for Credit\nLosses (continued)\n\nTable 4.14: TDR Modifications\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Amounts represent the recorded investment\nin loans after recognizing the effects of the\nTDR, if any.

Represents\nnonmarketable equity\nsecurities accounted\nfor under the\nmeasurement\nalternative.\nEquity Securities Held\nfor Trading Equity\nsecurities held for\ntrading purposes are\nmarketable equity\nsecurities traded on\norganized exchanges.\nThese securities are\nheld as part of our\ncustomer accommodation\ntrading activities.\nFor additional\ninformation on these\nactivities, see Note 2\n(Trading Activities).\nEquity Securities Not Held for Trading We also\nhold equity securities unrelated to trading\nactivities. These securities include private\nequity and tax credit investments, securities\nheld as economic hedges or to meet regulatory\nrequirements (for example, Federal Reserve\nBank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock). FAIR\nVALUE Marketable equity securities held for\npurposes other than trading consist of\nholdings of publicly traded equity securities\nheld for investment purposes and, to a lesser\nextent, exchange-traded equity funds held to\neconomically hedge obligations related to our\ndeferred compensation plans. We account for\ncertain nonmarketable equity securities under\nthe fair value method, and substantially all\nof these securities are economically hedged\nwith equity derivatives. EQUITY METHOD Our\nequity method investments consist of tax\ncredit and private equity investments, the\nmajority of which are our low-income housing\ntax credit (LIHTC) investments. We invest in\naffordable housing projects that qualify for\nthe LIHTC, which are designed to promote\nprivate development of low-income housing.\nThese investments typically generate a return\nthrough realization of federal tax credit and\nother tax benefits. In first quarter 2021, we\nrecognized pre-tax losses of $ 326million\nrelated to our LIHTC investments, compared\nwith $ 339million in first quarter 2020. These\nlosses were recognized in other noninterest\nincome. We also recognized total tax benefits\nof $ 435million in first quarter 2021, which\nincluded tax credits recorded to income taxes\nof $ 354million. In first quarter 2020, total\ntax benefits were $ 398million, which included\ntax credits of $ 314million. We are\nperiodically required to provide additional\nfinancial support during the investment\nperiod. A liability is recognized for unfunded\ncommitments that are both legally binding and\nprobable of funding. These commitments are\npredominantly funded within three yearsof\ninitial investment. Our liability for these\nunfunded commitments was $ 4.1billion at March\n31, 2021, and $ 4.2billion at December 31,\n2020. This liability for unfunded commitments\nis included in long-term debt.

we\nenter into various types of on- and off-\nbalance sheet transactions with special\npurpose entities (SPEs), which are\ncorporations, trusts, limited liability\ncompanies or partnerships that are established\nfor a limited purpose. SPEs are often formed\nin connection with securitization transactions\nwhereby financial assets are transferred to an\nSPE. SPEs formed in connection with\nsecuritization transactions are generally\nconsidered variable interest entities (VIEs).\nThe VIE may alter the risk profile of the\nasset by entering into derivative transactions\nor obtaining credit support, and issues\nvarious forms of interests in those assets to\ninvestors. When we transfer financial assets\nfrom our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE\nin connection with a securitization, we\ntypically receive cash and sometimes other\ninterests in the VIE as proceeds for the\nassets we transfer. In certain transactions\nwith VIEs, we may retain the right to service\nthe transferred assets and repurchase the\ntransferred assets if the outstanding balance\nof the assets falls below the level at which\nthe cost to service the assets exceed the\nbenefits. In addition, we may purchase the\nright to service loans transferred to a VIE by\na third party. In connection with our\nsecuritization or other VIE activities, we\nhave various forms of ongoing involvement with\nVIEs, which may include: \u2022 underwriting\nsecurities issued by VIEs and subsequently\nmaking markets in those securities; \u2022\nproviding credit enhancement on securities\nissued by VIEs through the use of letters of\ncredit or financial guarantees; \u2022 entering\ninto other derivative contracts with VIEs; \u2022\nholding senior or subordinated interests in\nVIEs; \u2022 acting as servicer or investment\nmanager for VIEs; \u2022 providing administrative\nor trustee services to VIEs; and \u2022 providing\nseller financing to VIEs. Loan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity We periodically\ntransfer consumer and commercial loans and\nother types of financial assets in\nsecuritization and whole loan sale\ntransactions. MORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S.\nGOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS\nWITH GINNIE MAE In the normal course of\nbusiness we sell originated and purchased\nresidential and commercial mortgage loans to\ngovernment-sponsored entities (GSEs). These\nloans are generally transferred into\nsecuritizations sponsored by the GSEs, which\nprovide certain credit guarantees to investors\nand servicers. We also transfer mortgage loans\ninto securitizations pursuant to Government\nNational Mortgage Association (GNMA)\nguidelines which are insured by the Federal\nHousing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\nMortgage loans eligible for securitization\nwith the GSEs or GNMA are considered\nconforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA design the\nstructure of these securitizations, sponsor\nthe involved VIEs, and have power over the\nactivities most significant to the VIE. We\naccount for loans transferred in conforming\nmortgage loan securitization transactions as\nsales and do not consolidate the VIEs as we\nare not the primary beneficiary. In exchange\nfor the transfer of loans, we typi cally\nreceive securities issued by the VIEs which we\nsell to third parties for cash or hold for\ninvestment purposes as HTM or AFS securities.\nWe also retain servicing rights on the\ntransferred loans. As a servicer, we retain\nthe option to repurchase loans from GNMA loan\nsecuritization pools, which becomes\nexercisable when three scheduled loan payments\nremain unpaid by the borrower. During the\nquarters ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we\nrepurchased loans of $ 1.9billion and $\n1.5billion, respectively, which predominantly\nrepresented repurchases of government insured\nloans. We recorded assets and related\nliabilities of $ 133million and $ 176million\nat March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020,\nrespectively, where we did not exercise our\noption to repurchase eligible loans. Upon\ntransfers of loans, we also provide\nindemnification for losses incurred due to\nmaterial breaches of contractual\nrepresentations and warranties, as well as\nother recourse arrangements. At March 31,\n2021, and December 31, 2020, our liability\nassociated with these provisions was $\n209million and $ 221million, respectively, and\nthe maximum exposure to loss was $ 13.4billion\nand $ 13.7billion, respectively. Off-balance\nsheet mortgage loans sold or secu ritized\npresented in Table 8.5 are predominantly loans\nsecuritized by the GSEs and GNMA. See Note 9\n(Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional\ninformation about residential and commercial\nservicing rights, advances and servicing fees.\nSubstantially all residential servicing\nactivity is related to assets transferred to\nGSE and GNMA securitizations. NONCONFORMING\nMORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS In the normal\ncourse of business, we sell nonconforming\nresidential and commercial mortgage loans in\nsecuritization transactions that we design and\nsponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan\nsecuritizations do not involve a government\ncredit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial\ninterest holders are subject to credit risk of\nthe underlying assets held by the\nsecuritization VIE. We typically originate the\ntransferred loans , account for the transfers\nas sales and do not consolidate the VIE. We\nalso typically retain the right to service the\nloans and may hold other beneficial interests\nissued by the VIEs, such as debt securities\nheld for investment purposes. Our servicing\nrole related to nonconforming commercial\nmortgage loan securitizations is limited to\nprimary or master servicer and the most\nsignificant decisions impacting the\nperformance of the VIE are generally made by\nthe special servicer or the controlling class\nsecurity holder. For our residential\nnonconforming mortgage loan securitizations\naccounted for as sales, we either do not hold\nvariable interests that we consider\npotentially significant or are not the primary\nservicer for a majority of the VIE assets.\nWHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We also sell\nwhole loans to VIEs where we have continuing\ninvolvement in the form of financing. We\naccount for these transfers as sales, and do\nnot consolidate the VIEs as we do not have the\npower to direct the most significant\nactivities of the VIEs. Table 8.1 presents\ninformation about transfers of assets during\nthe period for which we recorded the transfers\nas sales and have continuing involvement with\nthe transferred assets. In connection with\nthese transfers, we received proceeds and\nrecorded servicing assets, securities, and\nloans. Substantially all transfers were\nrelated to residential mortgage\nsecuritizations with the GSEs or GNMA and\nresulted in no gain or loss because the loans\nwere already measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. Each of these interests are\ninitially measured at fair value. Servicing\nrights are classified as Level 3 measurements,\nand generally securities are classified as\nLevel 2.\n                               \n  92    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 8.1: Transfers with Continuing\nInvolvement\n                                              \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                     2\u2026                2\u2026  \n  \u2026           R\u2026        C\u2026       R\u2026       C\u2026  \n  \u2026           m\u2026        m\u2026       m\u2026       m\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  4\u2026        3\u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       4\u2026        3\u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1\u2026        91        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  4\u2026        47        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1\u2026        29        \u2014        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       9\u2026         \u2014        \u2014        \u2014      \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(1) Represents cash\nproceeds and the fair\nvalue of non-cash\nbeneficial interests\nrecognized at\nsecuritization\nsettlement.

For additional information about\nthese VIEs, see the \u201cLoan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity\u201d section within this\nNote. Nonconforming mortgage loan\nsecuritizations also include commercial\nmortgage loan securitizations sponsored by\nthird parties where we did not originate or\ntransfer the loans but serve as master\nservicer and invest in securities that could\nbe potentially significant to the VIE.\nConforming loan securitization and\nresecuritization transactions involving the\nGSEs and GNMA are excluded from Table 8.6\nbecause we are not the sponsor or we do not\nhave power over the activities most\nsignificant to the VIEs. Additionally, due to\nthe nature of the guarantees provided by the\nGSEs and the FHA and VA, our credit risk\nassociated with these VIEs is limited. For\nadditional information about conforming\nmortgage loan securitizations and\nresecuritizations, see the \u201cLoan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity\u201d and \"Resecuritization\nActivities\" sections within this Note. TAX\nCREDIT STRUCTURES We co-sponsor and make\ninvestments in affordable housing and\nsustainable energy projects that are designed\nto generate a return primarily through the\nrealization of federal tax credits. The\nprojects are typically managed by project\nsponsors who have the power over the VIE\u2019s\nassets. In some instances, our investments in\nthese structures may require that we fund\nfuture capital commitments at the discretion\nof the project sponsors. COMMERCIAL REAL\nESTATE LOANS We transfer purchased industrial\ndevelopment bonds and GSE credit enhancements\nto VIEs in exchange for beneficial interests.\nWe own all of the beneficial interests and may\nalso service the underlying mortgages that\nserve as collateral to the bonds. Prior to\nfirst quarter 2021, we consolidated these VIEs\nas we controlled the key decisions. During\nfirst quarter 2021, we amended the structures\nsuch that we no longer control the key\ndecisions of the VIEs. The GSEs have the power\nto direct the servicing and workout activities\nof the VIE in the event of a default. As a\nresult, we deconsolidated the VIEs during\nfirst quarter 2021, and recognized the\nbeneficial interests at fair value on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. OTHER VIE\nSTRUCTURES We engage in various forms of\nstructured finance arrangements with other\nVIEs, including collateralized debt\nobligations, asset-backed finance structures\nand other securitizations collateralized by\nasset classes other than mortgages. Collateral\nmay include rental properties, asset-backed\nsecurities, student loans, mortgage loans and\nauto loans. We may participate in structuring\nor marketing the arrangements, as well as\nprovide financing, service one or more of the\nunderlying assets, or enter into derivatives\nwith the VIEs. We may also receive fees for\nthose services. We are not the primary\nbeneficiary of these structures because we do\nnot have power to direct the most significant\nactivities of the VIEs. Table 8.6 provides a\nsummary of our exposure to the unconsolidated\nVIEs described above, which includes\ninvestments in securities, loans, guarantees,\nliquidity agreements, commitments and certain\nderivatives. We exclude certain transactions\nwith unconsolidated VIEs when our continuing\ninvolvement is temporary or administrative in\nnature or insignificant in size. In Table 8.6,\n\u201cTotal VIE assets\u201d represents the remaining\nprincipal balance of assets held by\nunconsolidated VIEs using the most current\ninformation available. For VIEs that obtain\nexposure to assets synthetically through\nderivative instruments, the notional amount of\nthe derivative is included in the asset\nbalance. \u201cCarrying value\u201d is the amount in our\nconsolidated balance sheet related to our\ninvolvement with the unconsolidated VIEs.\n\u201cMaximum exposure to loss\u201d is determined as\nthe carrying value of our investment in the\nVIEs excluding the unconditional repurchase\noptions that have not been exercised, plus the\nremaining undrawn liquidity and lending\ncommitments, the notional amount of net\nwritten derivative contracts, and generally\nthe notional amount of, or stressed loss\nestimate for, other commitments and\nguarantees. Debt, guarantees and other\ncommitments include amounts related to loans\nsold that we may be required to repurchase, or\notherwise indemnify or reimburse the investor\nor insurer for losses incurred, due to\nmaterial breach of contractual\n                               \n  94    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nrepresentations and warranties as well as\nother retained recourse arrangements. The\nmaximum exposure to loss for material breach\nof contractual representations and warranties\nrepresents a stressed case estimate we utilize\nfor determining stressed case regulatory\ncapital needs and is considered to be a remote\nscenario. \u201cMaximum exposure to loss\u201d\nrepresents estimated loss that would be\nincurred under severe, hypothetical\ncircumstances, for which we believe the\npossibility is extremely remote, such as where\nthe value of our interests and any associated\ncollateral declines to zero, without any\nconsideration of recovery or offset from any\neconomic hedges. Accordingly, this disclosure\nis not an indication of expected loss.\n\nTable 8.6: Unconsolidated VIEs\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Includes $ 267million and $ 310million of\nsecurities classified as trading at March 31,\n2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n\n(2) All other assets includes mortgage\nservicing rights, derivative assets, and other\nassets (predominantly servicing advances).\n\n(3) Prior period has been revised to conform\nwith the current period presentation to\nreflect the carrying value of loans separately\nfrom all other assets.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    95  \n                               \nNote 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities (continued)\n\nConsolidated VIEs We consolidate VIEs where we\nare the primary beneficiary. We are the\nprimary beneficiary of the following structure\ntypes: COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND\nLEASES We securitize dealer floor plan loans\nand leases in a revolving master trust entity\nand hold the subordinated notes and residual\nequity interests. As servicer and residual\ninterest holder, we control the key decisions\nof the trust and consolidate the entity. The\ntotal VIE assets held by the master trust\nrepresent a majority of the total VIE assets\npresented for this category in Table 8.7. In a\nseparate transaction structure, we also\nprovide the majority of debt and equity\nfinancing to an SPE that engages in lending\nand leasing to specific vendors and service\nthe underlying collateral. OTHER VIE\nSTRUCTURES Other VIEs are primarily related to\nmunicipal tender option bond (MTOB)\ntransactions and nonconforming mortgage loan\nsecuritizations that we sponsor. MTOBs are\nvehicles to finance the purchase of municipal\nbonds through the issuance of short-term debt\nto investors. Our involvement with MTOBs\nincludes serving as the residual interest\nholder, which provides control over the key\ndecisions of the VIE, as well as the\nremarketing agent or liquidity provider\nrelated to the debt issued to investors. We\nalso securitize nonconforming mortgage loans,\nin which our involvement includes servicer of\nthe underlying assets and holder of\nsubordinate or senior securities issued by the\nVIE. Table 8.7 presents a summary of financial\nassets and liabilities of our consolidated\nVIEs. The carrying value represents assets and\nliabilities recorded on our consolidated\nbalance sheet. Carrying values of assets are\npresented using GAAP measurement methods,\nwhich may include fair value, credit\nimpairment or other adjustments, and therefore\nin some instances will differ from \u201cTotal VIE\nassets.\u201d For VIEs that obtain exposure\nsynthetically through derivative instruments,\nthe notional amount of the derivative is\nincluded in \u201cTotal VIE assets.\u201d On our\nconsolidated balance sheet, we separately\ndisclose (1) the consolidated assets of\ncertain VIEs that can only be used to settle\nthe liabilities of those VIEs, and (2) the\nconsolidated liabilities of certain VIEs for\nwhich the VIE creditors do not have recourse\nto Wells Fargo.\n\nTable 8.7: Transactions with Consolidated VIEs\n                                              \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2013                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n             \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n             \u2014      \u2014      \u2014      \u2014      \u2014    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2014    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) Includes $\n269million and $\n269million of\nsecurities classified\nas trading at March\n31, 2021, and December\n31, 2020,\nrespectively.\n\n(2) All other assets\nincludes cash and due\nfrom banks, Interest-\nearning deposits with\nbanks, derivative\nassets, equity\nsecurities, and other\nassets.\n\n(3) All other\nliabilities includes\nshort-term borrowings,\nderivative\nliabilities, and\naccrued expenses and\nother liabilities.\n\n(4) For structure\ndescription, see the\n\"Transactions with\nUnconsolidated VIEs\"\nsection within this\nNote. These\nconsolidated VIEs were\ndeconsolidated in\nfirst quarter 2021.\n\nOther Transactions In\naddition to the\ntransactions included\nin the previous\ntables, we have used\nwholly-owned trust\npreferred security\nVIEs to issue debt\nsecurities or\npreferred equity\nexclusively to third-\nparty investors. As\nthe sole assets of the\nVIEs are receivables\nfrom us, we do not\nconsolidate the VIEs\neven though we own all\nof the voting equity\nshares of the VIEs,\nhave fully guaranteed\nthe obligations of the\nVIEs, and may have the\nright to redeem the\nthird-party securities\nunder certain\ncircumstances.

As the servicer of\nloans for others, we advance certain payments\nof principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and\ndefault-related expenses which are generally\nreimbursed within a short timeframe from cash\nflows from the trust, GSEs, insurer or\nborrower. The credit risk related to these\nadvances is limited since the reimbursement is\ngenerally senior to cash payments to\ninvestors. We also advance payments of taxes\nand insurance for our owned loans which are\ncollectible from the borrower. We maintain an\nallowance for uncollectible amounts for\nadvances on loans serviced for others that may\nnot be reimbursed if the payments were not\nmade in accordance with applicable servicing\nagreements or if the insurance or servicing\nagreements contain limitations on\nreimbursements. Servicing advances on owned\nloans are charged-off when deemed\nuncollectible.

Estimated\nmaximum exposure to loss was $ 277million and\n$ 1.4billion with related collateral of $\n2.0billion and $ 1.2billion as of March 31,\n2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n\u201cMaximum exposure to loss\u201d and \u201cNon-investment\ngrade\u201d are required disclosures under GAAP.\nMaximum exposure to loss represents the\nestimated loss that would be incurred under an\nassumed hypothetical circumstance, despite\nwhat we believe is a remote possibility, where\nthe value of our interests and any associated\ncollateral declines to zero. Maximum exposure\nto loss estimates in Table 11.1 do not reflect\neconomic hedges or collateral we could use to\noffset or recover losses we may incur under\nour guarantee agreements. Accordingly, this\nrequired disclosure is not an indication of\nexpected loss. We believe the carrying value\nis more representative of our exposure to loss\nthan maximum exposure to loss. The carrying\nvalue represents the fair value of the\nguarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL\nfor guarantees, if applicable. Non-investment\ngrade represents those guarantees on which we\nhave a higher risk of performance under the\nterms of the guarantee. If the underlying\nassets under the guarantee are non-investment\ngrade (that is, an external rating that is\nbelow investment grade or an internal credit\ndefault grade that is equivalent to a below\ninvestment grade external rating), we consider\nthe risk of performance to be high. Internal\ncredit default grades are determined based\nupon the same credit policies that we use to\nevaluate the risk of payment or performance\nwhen making loans and other extensions of\ncredit. Credit quality indicators we usually\nconsider in evaluating risk of payments or\nperformance are described in Note 4 (Loans and\nRelated Allowance for Credit Losses). MERCHANT\nPROCESSING SERVICES We provide debit and\ncredit card transaction processing services\nthrough payment networks directly for\nmerchants and as a sponsor for merchant\nprocessing servicers, including our joint\nventure with a third party that is accounted\nfor as an equity method investment. In our\nrole as the merchant acquiring bank, we have a\npotential obligation in connection with\npayment and delivery disputes between the\nmerchant and the cardholder that are resolved\nin favor of the cardholder. If we are unable\nto collect the amounts from the merchant, we\nincur a loss for the refund to the cardholder.\nWe are secondarily obligated to make a refund\nfor transactions involving sponsored merchant\nprocessing servicers. We generally have a low\nlikelihood of loss in connection with our\nmerchant processing services because most\nproducts and services are delivered when\npurchased and amounts are generally refunded\nwhen items are returned to the merchant. In\naddition, we may reduce our risk in connection\nwith these transactions by withholding future\npayments and requiring cash or other\ncollateral. For first quarter 2021, we\nprocessed card transaction volume of $\n372.5billion as a merchant acquiring bank, and\nrelated losses, including those from our joint\nventure entity, were immaterial.\n                                \n  100    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nGUARANTEES OF\nSUBSIDIARIES In the\nnormal course of\nbusiness, the Parent\nmay provide\ncounterparties with\nguarantees related to\nits subsidiaries\u2019\nobligations. These\nobligations are\nincluded in the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated\nbalance sheet or are\nreflected as off-\nbalance sheet\ncommitments, and\ntherefore, the Parent\nhas not recognized a\nseparate liability for\nthese guarantees. The\nParent fully and\nunconditionally\nguarantees the payment\nof principal,\ninterest, and any\nother amounts that may\nbe due on securities\nthat its 100% owned\nfinance subsidiary,\nWells Fargo Finance\nLLC, may issue. These\nsecurities are not\nguaranteed by any\nother subsidiary of\nthe Parent. The\nguaranteed liabilities\nwere $ 1.8billion and\n$ 2.3billion at March\n31, 2021, and December\n31, 2020,\nrespectively. These\nguarantees rank on\nparity with all of the\nParent\u2019s other\nunsecured and\nunsubordinated\nindebtedness. The\nassets of the Parent\nconsist primarily of\nequity in its\nsubsidiaries, and the\nParent is a separate\nand distinct legal\nentity from its\nsubsidiaries. As a\nresult, the Parent\u2019s\nability to address\nclaims of holders of\nthese debt securities\nagainst the Parent\nunder the guarantee\ndepends on the\nParent\u2019s receipt of\ndividends, loan\npayments and other\nfunds from its\nsubsidiaries. If any\nof the Parent\u2019s\nsubsidiaries becomes\ninsolvent, the direct\ncreditors of that\nsubsidiary will have a\nprior claim on that\nsubsidiary\u2019s assets.\nThe rights of the\nParent and the rights\nof the Parent\u2019s\ncreditors will be\nsubject to that prior\nclaim unless the\nParent is also a\ndirect creditor of\nthat subsidiary. For\nadditional information\nregarding other\nrestrictions on the\nParent\u2019s ability to\nreceive dividends,\nloan payments and\nother funds from its\nsubsidiaries, see Note\n23 (Regulatory Capital\nRequirements and Other\nRestrictions).\n\nOTHER COMMITMENTS To\nmeet the financing\nneeds of our\ncustomers, we may\nenter into commitments\nto purchase debt and\nequity securities to\nprovide capital for\ntheir funding,\nliquidity or other\nfuture needs. As of\nboth March 31, 2021,\nand December 31, 2020,\nwe had commitments to\npurchase debt\nsecurities of $\n18million and\ncommitments to\npurchase equity\nsecurities of $\n3.1billion and $\n3.2billion,\nrespectively. As part\nof maintaining our\nmemberships in certain\nclearing\norganizations, we are\nrequired to stand\nready to provide\nliquidity to sustain\nmarket clearing\nactivity in the event\nunforeseen events\noccur or are deemed\nlikely to occur.\nCertain of these\nobligations are\nguarantees of other\nmembers\u2019 performance\nand accordingly are\nincluded in Table 11.1\nin Other guarantees\nand indemnifications.\nAlso, we have\ncommitments to\npurchase loans and\nsecurities under\nresale agreements from\ncertain\ncounterparties,\nincluding central\nclearing\norganizations. The\namount of our unfunded\ncontractual\ncommitments was $\n8.7billion and $\n12.0billion as of\nMarch 31, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020,\nrespectively. Given\nthe nature of these\ncommitments, they are\nexcluded from Table\n4.4 (Unfunded Credit\nCommitments) in Note 4\n(Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses).\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    101  \n                                \n                                         \n  Note 12:Pledged Assets and Collateral  \n                                         \nPledged Assets Table 12.1 provides the\ncarrying amount of on-balance sheet pledged\nassets and the fair value of other pledged\ncollateral. Other pledged collateral is\ncollateral we have received from third\nparties, have the right to repledge and is not\nrecognized on our consolidated balance sheet.\nTRADING RELATED ACTIVITY Our trading\nbusinesses may pledge debt and equity\nsecurities in connection with securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase (repurchase\nagreements) and securities lending\narrangements. The collateral that we pledge\nrelated to our trading activities may include\nour own collateral as well as collateral that\nwe have received from third parties and have\nthe right to repledge. All of the trading\nactivity pledged collateral is eligible to be\nrepledged or sold by the secured party. NON-\nTRADING RELATED ACTIVITY As part of our\nliquidity management strategy, we may pledge\nloans, debt securities, and other financial\nassets to secure trust and public deposits,\nborrowings and letters of credit from the\nFederal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB)\nand for other purposes as required or\npermitted by law or insurance statutory\nrequirements. Substantially all of the non-\ntrading activity pledged collateral is not\neligible to be repledged or sold by the\nsecured party. VIE RELATED We pledge assets in\nconnection with various types of transactions\nentered into with VIEs. These pledged assets\ncan only be used to settle the liabilities of\nthose entities. We also have loans recorded on\nour consolidated balance sheet which represent\ncertain delinquent loans that are eligible for\nrepurchase from GNMA loan securitizations. See\nNote 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities) for additional information on\nconsolidated VIE assets.\nTable 12.1: Pledged Assets\n                                              \n                     Mar              Dec     \n  (in                31,              31,     \n  mill\u2026              2021             2020    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Rela\u2026                                       \n  to                                          \n  trad\u2026                                       \n  acti\u2026                                       \n  Repl\u2026                                       \n  thir\u2026                                       \n  owned                                       \n  debt     $  51,2\u2026            44,7\u2026          \n  and                                         \n  equi\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Trad\u2026                                       \n  debt                                        \n  secu\u2026       20,8\u2026            19,5\u2026          \n  and                                         \n  other                                       \n  Equi\u2026         716              470          \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  pled\u2026                                       \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  rela\u2026       72,7\u2026            64,8\u2026          \n  to                                          \n  trad\u2026                                       \n  acti\u2026                                       \n  Rela\u2026                                       \n  to                                          \n  non-\u2026                                       \n  acti\u2026                                       \n  Loans       313,\u2026            344,\u2026          \n  Debt                                        \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Avai\u2026       52,4\u2026            57,2\u2026          \n  Held\u2026       13,3\u2026            17,2\u2026          \n  Other                                       \n  fina\u2026         727              230          \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  pled\u2026                                       \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  rela\u2026       380,\u2026            419,\u2026          \n  to                                          \n  non-\u2026                                       \n  acti\u2026                                       \n  Rela\u2026                                       \n  to                                          \n  VIEs:                                       \n  Cons\u2026                                       \n  VIE         6,714            12,1\u2026          \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Loans                                       \n  elig\u2026                                       \n  for                                         \n  repu\u2026         135              179          \n  from                                        \n  GNMA                                        \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  pled\u2026                                       \n  asse\u2026       6,849            12,3\u2026          \n  rela\u2026                                       \n  to                                          \n  VIEs                                        \n  Total                                       \n  pled\u2026    $  459,\u2026            496,\u2026          \n  asse\u2026                                       \n                                              \nSecurities Financing Activities We enter into\nresale and repurchase agreements and\nsecurities borrowing and lending agreements\n(collectively, \u201csecurities financing\nactivities\u201d) typically to finance trading\npositions (including securities and\nderivatives), acquire securities to cover\nshort trading positions, accommodate\ncustomers\u2019 financing needs, and settle other\nsecurities obligations. These activities are\nconducted through our broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, through\nother bank entities. Our securities financing\nactivities primarily involve high-quality,\nliquid securities such as U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and government agency securities\nand, to a lesser extent, less liquid\nsecurities, including equity securities,\ncorporate bonds and asset-backed securities.\nWe account for these transactions as\ncollateralized financings in which we\ntypically receive or pledge securities as\ncollateral. We believe these financing\ntransactions generally do not have material\ncredit risk given the collateral provided and\nthe related monitoring processes. OFFSETTING\nOF SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES Table 12.2\npresents resale and repurchase agreements\nsubject to master repurchase agreements (MRA)\nand securities borrowing and lending\nagreements subject to master securities\nlending agreements (MSLA). Collateralized\nfinancings, and those with a single\ncounterparty, are presented net on our\nconsolidated balance sheet, provided certain\ncriteria are met that permit balance sheet\nnetting. Substantially all transactions\nsubject to these agreements do not meet those\ncriteria and thus are not eligible for balance\nsheet netting. Collateral we pledged consists\nof non-cash instruments, such as securities or\nloans, and is not netted on the consolidated\nbalance sheet against the related liability.\nCollateral we received includes securities or\nloans and is not recognized on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. Collateral pledged\nor received may be increased or decreased over\ntime to maintain certain contractual\nthresholds, as the assets underlying each\narrangement fluctuate in value. Generally,\nthese agreements require collateral to exceed\nthe asset or liability recognized on the\nbalance sheet.

While these agreements are typically\nover-collateralized, U.S. GAAP requires\ndisclosure in this table to limit the reported\namount of such collateral to the amount of the\nrelated recognized asset or liability for each\ncounterparty. In addition to the amounts\nincluded in Table 12.2, we also have balance\nsheet netting related to derivatives that is\ndisclosed in Note 14 (Derivatives).\n\nTable 12.2: Offsetting \u2013 Securities Financing\nActivities\n                                              \n                     Mar              Dec     \n  (in                31,              31,     \n  mill\u2026              2021             2020    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Asse\u2026                                       \n  Resa\u2026                                       \n  and                                         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  borr\u2026                                       \n  agre\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026    $  113,\u2026            92,4\u2026          \n  reco\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  offs\u2026                                       \n  in          -16,\u2026            -11,\u2026          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (1)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  in                                          \n  cons\u2026       97,1\u2026            80,9\u2026          \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (2)                                         \n  Coll\u2026                                       \n  not                                         \n  reco\u2026                                       \n  in          -96,\u2026            -80,\u2026          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (3)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026    $    745              775          \n  (4)                                         \n  Liab\u2026                                       \n  Repu\u2026                                       \n  and                                         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  lend\u2026                                       \n  agre\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026    $  63,0\u2026            57,6\u2026          \n  reco\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  offs\u2026                                       \n  in          -16,\u2026            -11,\u2026          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (1)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  in                                          \n  cons\u2026       46,5\u2026            46,1\u2026          \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (5)                                         \n  Coll\u2026                                       \n  pled\u2026                                       \n  but                                         \n  not                                         \n  nett\u2026       -46,\u2026            -45,\u2026          \n  in                                          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (6)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026    $    211              290          \n  (4)                                         \n                                              \n(1) Represents recognized amount of resale and\nrepurchase agreements with counterparties\nsubject to enforceable MRAs that have been\noffset in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n(2) Includes $ 79.4billion and $ 65.6billion\nclassified on our consolidated balance sheet\nin federal funds sold and securities purchased\nunder resale agreements at March 31, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020, respectively.

These\namounts include securities we have sold or\nrepledged to others with a fair value of $\n47.2billion and $ 36.1billion at March 31,\n2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n\n(4) Represents the amount of our exposure\n(assets) or obligation (liabilities) that is\nnot collateralized and/or is not subject to an\nenforceable MRA or MSLA.\n\n(5) Amount is classified in short-term\nborrowings on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n(6) Represents the fair value of collateral we\nhave pledged, related to enforceable MRAs or\nMSLAs, limited in the table above to the\namount of the recognized liability owed to\neach counterparty. At March 31, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020, we have pledged total\ncollateral with a fair value of $ 64.6billion\nand $ 59.2billion, respectively, substantially\nall of which may be sold or repledged by the\ncounterparty.\n\nREPURCHASE AND SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements\nand securities lending arrangements are\neffectively short-term collateralized\nborrowings. In these transactions, we receive\ncash in exchange for transferring securities\nas collateral and recognize an obligation to\nreacquire the securities for cash at the\ntransaction\u2019s maturity. These types of\ntransactions create risks, including (1) the\ncounterparty may fail to return the securities\nat maturity, (2) the fair value of the\nsecurities transferred may decline below the\namount of our obligation to reacquire the\nsecurities, and therefore create an obligation\nfor us to pledge additional amounts, and (3)\nthe counterparty may accelerate the maturity\non demand, requiring us to reacquire the\nsecurity prior to contractual maturity. We\nattempt to mitigate these risks in various\nways. Our collateral primarily consists of\nhighly liquid securities. In addition, we\nunderwrite and monitor the financial strength\nof our counterparties, monitor the fair value\nof collateral pledged relative to\ncontractually required repurchase amounts, and\nmonitor that our collateral is properly\nreturned through the clearing and settlement\nprocess in advance of our cash repayment.\nTable 12.3 provides the gross amounts\nrecognized on the consolidated balance sheet\n(before the effects of offsetting) of our\nliabilities for repurchase and securities\nlending agreements disaggregated by underlying\ncollateral type.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    103  \n                                \nNote 12: Pledged Assets and Collateral\n(continued)\n\nTable 12.3: Gross Obligations by Underlying\nCollateral Type\n                                              \n                      Mar              Dec    \n  (in                 31,              31,    \n  mill\u2026               2021             2020   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Repu\u2026                                       \n  agre\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  U.S.                                        \n  Trea\u2026    $  28,507           22,922         \n  and                                         \n  fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  U.S.                                        \n  Stat\u2026            9                4         \n  and                                         \n  poli\u2026                                       \n  subd\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026       12,678           15,353         \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Non-\u2026                                       \n  mort\u2026        1,007            1,069         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Corp\u2026                                       \n  debt        10,291            9,944         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Asse\u2026        1,072            1,054         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Equi\u2026        1,211            1,500         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Other          683              336         \n  Total       55,458           52,182         \n  repu\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  lend\u2026                                       \n  arra\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  U.S.                                        \n  Trea\u2026           19               64         \n  and                                         \n  fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026           53               23         \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Corp\u2026                                       \n  debt            38               79         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Equi\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026        7,375            5,189         \n  (1)                                         \n  Other          119               85         \n  Total                                       \n  secu\u2026        7,604            5,440         \n  lend\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  repu\u2026                                       \n  and      $  63,062           57,622         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  lend\u2026                                       \n                                              \n(1) Equity securities are generally exchange\ntraded and represent collateral received from\nthird parties that has been repledged.

These\nproceedings and investigations include actions\nbrought against Wells Fargo and/or our\nsubsidiaries with respect to corporate-related\nmatters and transactions in which Wells Fargo\nand/or our subsidiaries were involved. In\naddition, Wells Fargo and our subsidiaries may\nbe requested to provide information or\notherwise cooperate with government\nauthorities in the conduct of investigations\nof other persons or industry groups. Although\nthere can be no assurance as to the ultimate\noutcome, Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries\nhave generally denied, or believe we have a\nmeritorious defense and will deny, liability\nin all significant legal actions pending\nagainst us, including the matters described\nbelow, and we intend to defend vigorously each\ncase, other than matters we describe as having\nsettled. We establish accruals for legal\nactions when potential losses associated with\nthe actions become probable and the costs can\nbe reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we\nrecord the amount we consider to be the best\nestimate within a range of potential losses\nthat are both probable and estimable; however,\nif we cannot determine a best estimate, then\nwe record the low end of the range of those\npotential losses. The actual costs of\nresolving legal actions may be substantially\nhigher or lower than the amounts accrued for\nthose actions. ATM ACCESS FEE LITIGATION In\nOctober 2011, plaintiffs filed a putative\nclass action, Mackmin, et al. v. Visa, Inc. et\nal. , against Wells Fargo & Company, Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A., Visa, MasterCard, and\nseveral other banks in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia.\nPlaintiffs allege that the Visa and MasterCard\nrequirement that if an ATM operator charges an\naccess fee on Visa and MasterCard\ntransactions, then that fee cannot be greater\nthan the access fee charged for transactions\non other networks, violates antitrust rules.\nPlaintiffs seek treble damages, restitution,\ninjunctive relief, and attorneys\u2019 fees where\navailable under federal and state law. Two\nother antitrust cases that make similar\nallegations were filed in the same court, but\nthese cases did not name Wells Fargo as a\ndefendant. On February 13, 2013, the district\ncourt granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss\nthe threeactions. Plaintiffs appealed the\ndismissals and, on August 4, 2015, the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia Circuit vacated the district court\u2019s\ndecisions and remanded the threecases to the\ndistrict court for further proceedings. On\nJune 28, 2016, the United States Supreme Court\ngranted defendants\u2019 petitions for writ of\ncertiorari to review the decisions of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the\nDistrict of Columbia. On November 17, 2016,\nthe United States Supreme Court dismissed the\npetitions as improvidently granted, and the\nthreecases returned to the district court for\nfurther proceedings. The Company has entered\ninto an agreement pursuant to which the\nCompany will pay $ 20.8million to resolve the\ncases, subject to court approval. AUTOMOBILE\nLENDING MATTERS On April 20, 2018, the Company\nentered into consent orders with the Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to\nresolve, among other things, investigations by\nthe agencies into the Company\u2019s compliance\nrisk management program and its past practices\ninvolving certain automobile collateral\nprotection insurance (CPI) policies and\ncertain mortgage interest rate lock\nextensions. The consent orders require\nremediation to customers and the payment of a\ntotal of $ 1.0billion in civil money penalties\nto the agencies. In July 2017, the Company\nannounced a plan to remediate customers who\nmay have been financially harmed due to issues\nrelated to automobile CPI policies purchased\nthrough a third-party vendor on their behalf.\nMultiple putative class actions alleging,\namong other things, unfair and deceptive\npractices relating to these CPI policies, have\nbeen filed against the Company and\nconsolidated into onemulti-district litigation\nin the United States District Court for the\nCentral District of California. The Company\nhas reached an agreement to resolve the multi-\ndistrict litigation pursuant to which the\nCompany has agreed to pay, consistent with its\nremediation obligations under the consent\norders, approximately $ 693million in\nremediation to customers with CPI policies\nplaced between October 15, 2005, and September\n30, 2016. The settlement amount is not\nincremental to the Company\u2019s remediation\nobligations under the consent orders, but\ninstead encompasses those obligations,\nincluding remediation payments to date. The\nsettlement amount is subject to change as the\nCompany finalizes its remediation activity\nunder the consent orders. In addition, the\nCompany has agreed to contribute $ 1million to\na common fund for the class. The district\ncourt granted final approval of the settlement\non November 21, 2019. Shareholders also filed\na putative securities fraud class action\nagainst the Company and its executive officers\nalleging material misstatements and omissions\nof CPI-related information in the Company\u2019s\npublic disclosures. In January 2020, the court\ndismissed this action as to all defendants\nexcept the Company and a former executive\nofficer and limited the action to two alleged\nmisstatements. In addition, the Company is\nsubject to a class action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Central District of\nCalifornia alleging that customers are\nentitled to refunds related to the unused\nportion of guaranteed automobile protection\n(GAP) waiver or insurance agreements between\nthe customer and dealer and, by assignment,\nthe lender. Allegations related to the CPI and\nGAP programs are among the subjects of a\nshareholder derivative lawsuit pending in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California. These and other issues\nrelated to the origination, servicing, and\ncollection of consumer auto loans, including\nrelated insurance products, have also\nsubjected the Company to formal or informal\ninquiries, investigations, or examinations\nfrom federal and state government agencies,\nincluding the CFPB. In December 2018, the\nCompany entered into an agreement with all 50\nstate Attorneys General and the District of\nColumbia to resolve an investigation into the\nCompany\u2019s retail sales practices, CPI and GAP,\nand mortgage interest rate lock matters,\npursuant to which the Company paid $\n575million. COMMERCIAL LENDING SHAREHOLDER\nLITIGATION In October and November 2020,\nplaintiffs filed two putative securities fraud\nclass actions in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of California\nalleging that the Company and certain of its\nformer executive officers made false and\nmisleading statements or omissions regarding,\namong other things, the Company\u2019s commercial\nlending underwriting practices, the credit\nquality of its commercial credit portfolios,\nand the value of its commercial loans,\ncollateralized loan obligations and commercial\nmortgage-backed securities.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    105  \n                                \n                                              \n  Note 13:Legal Actions(continued)            \n                                              \nCONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION Wells\nFargo shareholders have brought a putative\nsecurities fraud class action in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York alleging that the Company\nand certain of its current and former\nexecutive officers and directors made false or\nmisleading statements regarding the Company\u2019s\nefforts to comply with the February 2018\nconsent order with the Federal Reserve Board\nand the April 2018 consent orders with the\nCFPB and OCC. Allegations related to the\nCompany\u2019s efforts to comply with these three\nconsent orders are also among the subjects of\na shareholder derivative lawsuit pending in\nthe United States District Court for the\nNorthern District of California. CONSUMER\nDEPOSIT ACCOUNT RELATED REGULATORY\nINVESTIGATIONS The CFPB is conducting an\ninvestigation into whether customers were\nunduly harmed by the Company\u2019s historical\npractices associated with the freezing (and,\nin many cases, closing) of consumer deposit\naccounts after the Company detected suspected\nfraudulent activity (by third parties or\naccount holders) that affected those accounts.\nThe CFPB is also investigating certain of the\nCompany's past disclosures to customers\nregarding the minimum qualifying debit card\nusage required for customers to receive a\nwaiver of monthly service fees on certain\nconsumer deposit accounts. CORONAVIRUS AID,\nRELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT/PAYCHECK\nPROTECTION PROGRAM Plaintiffs filed putative\nclass actions in various federal courts\nagainst the Company. The actions sought\ndamages and injunctive relief related to the\nCompany\u2019s offering of Paycheck Protection\nProgram (PPP) loans under the Coronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic Security Act, as well as\nclaims for fees by purported agents who\nallegedly assisted customers with preparing\nPPP loan applications submitted to the\nCompany. These actions have been dismissed or,\nin a limited number of cases, are proceeding\non an individual basis. The Company has also\nreceived formal and informal inquiries from\nfederal and state government agencies\nregarding its offering of PPP loans. FOREIGN\nEXCHANGE BUSINESS The United States Department\nof Justice (Department of Justice) is\ninvestigating certain activities in the\nCompany\u2019s foreign exchange business, including\nwhether customers may have received pricing\ninconsistent with commitments made to those\ncustomers. Previous investigations by other\nfederal government agencies have been\nresolved. INTERCHANGE LITIGATION Plaintiffs\nrepresenting a class of merchants have filed\nputative class actions, and individual\nmerchants have filed individual actions,\nagainst Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo &\nCompany, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and Wachovia\nCorporation regarding the interchange fees\nassociated with Visa and MasterCard payment\ncard transactions. Visa, MasterCard, and\nseveral other banks and bank holding companies\nare also named as defendants in these actions.\nThese actions have been consolidated in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York. The amended and\nconsolidated complaint asserts claims against\ndefendants based on alleged violations of\nfederal and state antitrust laws and seeks\ndamages, as well as injunctive relief.\nPlaintiff merchants allege that Visa,\nMasterCard, and payment card issuing banks\nunlawfully colluded to set interchange rates.\nPlaintiffs also allege that enforcement of\ncertain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged\ntying and bundling of services offered to\nmerchants are anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and\nWachovia, along with other defendants and\nentities, are parties to Loss and Judgment\nSharing Agreements, which provide that they,\nalong with other entities, will share, based\non a formula, in any losses from the\nInterchange Litigation. On July 13, 2012,\nVisa, MasterCard, and the financial\ninstitution defendants, including Wells Fargo,\nsigned a memorandum of understanding with\nplaintiff merchants to resolve the\nconsolidated class action and reached a\nseparate settlement in principle of the\nconsolidated individual actions. The\nsettlement payments to be made by all\ndefendants in the consolidated class and\nindividual actions totaled approximately $\n6.6billion before reductions applicable to\ncertain merchants opting out of the\nsettlement. The class settlement also provided\nfor the distribution to class merchants of 10\nbasis points of default interchange across all\ncredit rate categories for a period of eight\nconsecutive months. The district court granted\nfinal approval of the settlement, which was\nappealed to the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit by settlement objector\nmerchants. Other merchants opted out of the\nsettlement and are pursuing several individual\nactions. On June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit\nvacated the settlement agreement and reversed\nand remanded the consolidated action to the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York for further proceedings.\nOn November 23, 2016, prior class counsel\nfiled a petition to the United States Supreme\nCourt, seeking review of the reversal of the\nsettlement by the Second Circuit, and the\nSupreme Court denied the petition on March 27,\n2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court\nappointed lead class counsel for a damages\nclass and an equitable relief class. The\nparties have entered into a settlement\nagreement to resolve the money damages class\nclaims pursuant to which defendants will pay a\ntotal of approximately $ 6.2billion, which\nincludes approximately $ 5.3billion of funds\nremaining from the 2012 settlement and $\n900million in additional funding. The\nCompany\u2019s allocated responsibility for the\nadditional funding is approximately $\n94.5million. The court granted final approval\nof the settlement on December 13, 2019, which\nwas appealed to the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit by settlement\nobjector merchants. Several of the opt-out and\ndirect action litigations have been settled\nwhile others remain pending. LOW INCOME\nHOUSING TAX CREDITS Federal government\nagencies have undertaken formal or informal\ninquiries or investigations regarding the\nmanner in which the Company purchased, and\nnegotiated the purchase of, certain federal\nlow income housing tax credits in connection\nwith the financing of low income housing\ndevelopments. MORTGAGE LOAN MODIFICATION\nMATTERS Plaintiffs representing a class of\nmortgage borrowers have filed separate\nputative class actions, Hernandez v. Wells\nFargo, et al. , Coordes v. Wells Fargo, et al.\n, Ryder v. Wells Fargo , Liguori v. Wells\nFargo , and Dore v. Wells Fargo , against\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A., in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, the United States District Court\nfor the District of Washington, the United\nStates District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Ohio, the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York,\nand the United States District Court for the\nWestern District of Pennsylvania,\nrespectively. Plaintiffs allege that Wells\nFargo improperly denied mortgage loan\nmodifications or repayment plans to customers\nin the foreclosure process due to the\noverstatement of foreclosure attorneys\u2019 fees\nthat were included for purposes of determining\nwhether a customer in the foreclosure process\nqualified for a mortgage loan modification or\nrepayment plan. In March 2020, the Company\nentered into an agreement pursuant to which\nthe Company paid $ 18.5million to resolve the\nclaims of the initial certified class in the\nHernandez\n                                \n  106    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \ncase, which was approved by the district court\nin October 2020. The Hernandez settlement has\nbeen reopened to include additional borrowers\nwho the Company determined should have been\nincluded in the settlement class because the\nCompany identified a population of additional\nborrowers during the relevant class period\nwhose loans had not previously been reviewed\nfor inclusion in the original population of\nimpacted customers. The identification of\nthese additional borrowers will increase the\npotential class of mortgage borrowers in the\nother pending matters. In addition, federal\nbanking regulators and other government\nagencies have undertaken formal or informal\ninquiries or investigations regarding these\nand other mortgage servicing matters.\nNOMURA/NATIXIS MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION In\nAugust 2014 and August 2015, Nomura Credit &\nCapital Inc. (Nomura) and Natixis Real Estate\nHoldings, LLC (Natixis) filed a total of\nseventhird-party complaints against Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A., in New York state court. In\nthe underlying first-party actions, Nomura and\nNatixis have been sued for alleged breaches of\nrepresentations and warranties made in\nconnection with residential mortgage-backed\nsecurities sponsored by them. In the third-\nparty actions, Nomura and Natixis allege that\nWells Fargo, as master servicer, primary\nservicer or securities administrator, failed\nto notify Nomura and Natixis of their own\nbreaches, failed to properly oversee the\nprimary servicers, and failed to adhere to\naccepted servicing practices. Natixis\nadditionally alleges that Wells Fargo failed\nto perform default oversight duties. Wells\nFargo has asserted counterclaims alleging that\nNomura and Natixis failed to provide Wells\nFargo notice of their representation and\nwarranty breaches. OFAC RELATED INVESTIGATION\nThe Company has self-identified an issue\nwhereby certain foreign banks utilized a Wells\nFargo software-based solution to conduct\nimport/export trade-related financing\ntransactions with countries and entities\nprohibited by the Office of Foreign Assets\nControl (OFAC) of the United States Department\nof the Treasury. We do not believe any funds\nrelated to these transactions flowed through\naccounts at Wells Fargo as a result of the\naforementioned conduct. The Company has made\nvoluntary self-disclosures to OFAC and is\ncooperating with an inquiry from the\nDepartment of Justice. ORDER OF POSTING\nLITIGATION Plaintiffs filed a series of\nputative class actions against Wachovia Bank,\nN.A., and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as well as\nmany other banks, challenging the \u201chigh to\nlow\u201d order in which the banks post debit card\ntransactions to consumer deposit accounts.\nMost of these actions were consolidated in\nmulti-district litigation proceedings (MDL\nproceedings) in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of Florida.\nThe court in the MDL proceedings has certified\na class of putative plaintiffs, and Wells\nFargo moved to compel arbitration of the\nclaims of unnamed class members. The court\ndenied the motions to compel arbitration in\nOctober 2016, and Wells Fargo appealed this\ndecision to the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Eleventh Circuit. In May 2018, the\nEleventh Circuit ruled in Wells Fargo\u2019s favor\nand found that Wells Fargo had not waived its\narbitration rights and remanded the case to\nthe district court for further proceedings. On\nSeptember 26, 2019, the district court entered\nan order granting Wells Fargo\u2019s motion and\ndismissed the claims of unnamed class members\nin favor of arbitration, which was appealed by\nplaintiffs to the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In April\n2021, the Eleventh Circuit upheld the district\ncourt's decision. RETAIL SALES PRACTICES\nMATTERS A number of bodies or entities,\nincluding (a) federal, state, and local\ngovernment agencies, including the Department\nof Justice, the United States Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC), and the United\nStates Department of Labor, (b) state\nattorneys general, including the New York\nAttorney General, and (c) Congressional\ncommittees, have undertaken formal or informal\ninquiries, investigations, or examinations\narising out of certain retail sales practices\nof the Company that were the subject of\nsettlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the\nOffice of the Los Angeles City Attorney\nannounced by the Company on September 8, 2016.\nThe Company has responded to requests from\ncertain of the foregoing. As previously\ndisclosed, the Company entered into agreements\nto resolve the state attorneys general\ninvestigations. On February 21, 2020, the\nCompany entered into an agreement with the\nDepartment of Justice to resolve the\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s criminal investigation\ninto the Company\u2019s retail sales practices, as\nwell as a separate agreement to resolve the\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s civil investigation.\nAs part of the Department of Justice criminal\nsettlement, no charges will be filed against\nthe Company provided the Company abides by all\nthe terms of the agreement. The Department of\nJustice criminal settlement also includes the\nCompany\u2019s agreement that the facts set forth\nin the settlement document constitute\nsufficient facts for the finding of criminal\nviolations of statutes regarding bank records\nand personal information.On February 21, 2020,\nthe Company also entered into an order to\nresolve the SEC\u2019s investigation arising out of\nthe Company\u2019s retail sales practices. The SEC\norder contains a finding, to which the Company\nconsented, that the facts set forth include\nviolations of Section 10(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\nthereunder.As part of the resolution of the\nDepartment of Justice and SEC investigations,\nthe Company made payments totaling $\n3.0billion. In addition, as part of the\nsettlements and included in the $ 3.0billion\namount, the Company agreed to the creation of\na $ 500million Fair Fund for the benefit of\ninvestors who were harmed by the conduct\ncovered in the SEC settlement. In addition, a\nnumber of lawsuits were filed by non-\ngovernmental parties seeking damages or other\nremedies related to these retail sales\npractices. As previously disclosed, the\nCompany entered into various settlements to\nresolve these lawsuits. A purported Employee\nRetirement Income Security Act (ERISA) class\naction was filed in the United States District\nCourt for the District of Minnesota on behalf\nof 401(k) plan participants. The district\ncourt dismissed the action, and on July 27,\n2020, the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal. The\n401(k) plan participants filed a writ of\ncertiorari to the United States Supreme Court,\nwhich was denied on May 3, 2021. RMBS TRUSTEE\nLITIGATION In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF\nLimited and certain related entities and the\nNational Credit Union Administration (NCUA)\nfiled complaints in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York\nagainst Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., alleging\nclaims against the Company in its capacity as\ntrustee for a number of residential mortgage-\nbacked securities trusts. Complaints raising\nsimilar allegations have been filed by\nCommerzbank AG in the Southern District of New\nYork and by IKB International and IKB Deutsche\nIndustriebank in New York state court. In each\ncase, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to\ninvestors, and plaintiffs assert causes of\naction based upon, among other things, the\ntrustee\u2019s alleged failure to notify and\nenforce repurchase obligations of mortgage\nloan sellers for purported breaches of\nrepresentations and warranties, notify\ninvestors of\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    107  \n                                \n                                              \n  Note 13:Legal Actions(continued)            \n                                              \nalleged events of\ndefault, and abide by\nappropriate standards\nof care following\nalleged events of\ndefault. The Company\npreviously settled\ntwoclass actions with\nsimilar allegations\nthat were filed in\nNovember 2014 and\nDecember 2016 by\ninstitutional\ninvestors in the\nSouthern District of\nNew York and New York\nstate court,\nrespectively. In March\n2021, the Company\nentered into an\nagreement to resolve\nthe case filed by the\nNCUA. SEMINOLE TRIBE\nTRUSTEE LITIGATION The\nSeminole Tribe of\nFlorida filed a\ncomplaint in Florida\nstate court alleging\nthat Wells Fargo, as\ntrustee, charged\nexcess fees in\nconnection with the\nadministration of a\nminor\u2019s trust and\nfailed to invest the\nassets of the trust\nprudently. The\ncomplaint was later\namended to include\nthreeindividual\ncurrent and former\nbeneficiaries as\nplaintiffs and to\nremove the Tribe as a\nparty to the case. In\nDecember 2016, the\nCompany filed a motion\nto dismiss the amended\ncomplaint on the\ngrounds that the Tribe\nis a necessary party\nand that the\nindividual\nbeneficiaries lack\nstanding to bring\nclaims. The motion was\ndenied in June 2018.\nThe case is pending\ntrial.\n\nOUTLOOK As described\nabove, the Company\nestablishes accruals\nfor legal actions when\npotential losses\nassociated with the\nactions become\nprobable and the costs\ncan be reasonably\nestimated. The high\nend of the range of\nreasonably possible\npotential losses in\nexcess of the\nCompany\u2019s accrual for\nprobable and estimable\nlosses was\napproximately $\n2.6billion as of March\n31, 2021. The outcomes\nof legal actions are\nunpredictable and\nsubject to significant\nuncertainties, and it\nis inherently\ndifficult to determine\nwhether any loss is\nprobable or even\npossible. It is also\ninherently difficult\nto estimate the amount\nof any loss and there\nmay be matters for\nwhich a loss is\nprobable or reasonably\npossible but not\ncurrently estimable.\nAccordingly, actual\nlosses may be in\nexcess of the\nestablished accrual or\nthe range of\nreasonably possible\nloss. Based on\ninformation currently\navailable, advice of\ncounsel, available\ninsurance coverage,\nand established\nreserves, Wells Fargo\nbelieves that the\neventual outcome of\nthe actions against\nWells Fargo and/or its\nsubsidiaries will not,\nindividually or in the\naggregate, have a\nmaterial adverse\neffect on Wells\nFargo\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial condition.\nHowever, it is\npossible that the\nultimate resolution of\na matter, if\nunfavorable, may be\nmaterial to Wells\nFargo\u2019s results of\noperations for any\nparticular period.\n                                \n  108    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \n                       \n  Note 14:Derivatives  \n                       \nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to\nmarket risk, including interest rate risk,\ncredit risk and foreign currency risk, and to\nassist customers with their risk management\nobjectives. We designate certain derivatives\nas hedging instruments in qualifying hedge\naccounting relationships (fair value or cash\nflow hedges). Our remaining derivatives\nconsist of economic hedges that do not qualify\nfor hedge accounting and derivatives held for\ncustomer accommodation trading or other\npurposes. For additional information on our\nderivative activities, see Note 16\n(Derivatives) in our 2020 Form 10-K. Table\n14.1 presents the total notional or\ncontractual amounts and fair values for our\nderivatives. Derivative transactions can be\nmeasured in terms of the notional amount, but\nthis amount is not recorded on our\nconsolidated balance sheet and is not, when\nviewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of\nthe risk profile of the instruments. The\nnotional amount is generally not exchanged,\nbut is used only as the basis on which\ninterest and other payments are determined.\nTable 14.1: Notional or Contractual Amounts\nand Fair Values of Derivatives\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2014    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \nTable 14.2 provides information on the gross\nfair values of derivative assets and\nliabilities, the balance sheet netting\nadjustments and the resulting net fair value\namount recorded on our consolidated balance\nsheet, as well as the non-cash collateral\nassociated with such arrangements. We execute\nsubstantially all of our derivative\ntransactions under master netting arrangements\nand reflect all derivative balances and\nrelated cash collateral subject to enforceable\nmaster netting arrangements on a net basis\nwithin the consolidated balance sheet. The\n\u201cGross amounts recognized\u201d column in the\nfollowing table includes $ 55.9billion and $\n48.0billion of gross derivative assets and\nliabilities, respectively, at March 31, 2021,\nand $ 54.6billion and $ 50.1billion,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2020, with\ncounterparties subject to enforceable master\nnetting arrangements that are eligible for\nbalance sheet netting adjustments. The\nmajority of these amounts are interest rate\ncontracts executed in over-the-counter (OTC)\nmarkets. The remaining gross derivative assets\nand liabilities of $ 10.0billion and $\n6.1billion, respectively, at March 31, 2021,\nand $ 11.1billion and $ 8.0billion,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2020, include\nthose with counterparties subject to master\nnetting arrangements for which we have not\nassessed the enforceability because they are\nwith counterparties where we do not currently\nhave positions to offset, those subject to\nmaster netting arrangements where we have not\nbeen able to confirm the enforceability and\nthose not subject to master netting\narrangements. As such, we do not net\nderivative balances or collateral within the\nconsolidated balance sheet for these\ncounterparties. Cash collateral receivables\nand payables that have not been offset against\nour derivatives were $ 1.6billion and $\n2.9billion, respectively, at March 31, 2021,\nand $ 1.8billion and $ 984million,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2020.

In addition to the netting\namounts included in the table, we also have\nbalance sheet netting related to resale and\nrepurchase agreements that are disclosed\nwithin Note 12 (Pledged Assets and\nCollateral).\n\nTable 14.2: Gross Fair Values of Derivative\nAssets and Liabilities\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n                                              \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n                                              \n(1) Represents amounts with counterparties\nsubject to enforceable master netting\narrangements that have been offset in the\nconsolidated balance sheet, including related\ncash collateral and portfolio level\ncounterparty valuation adjustments.\nCounterparty valuation adjustments related to\nderivative assets were $ 293million and $\n399million and debit valuation adjustments\nrelated to derivative liabilities were $\n205million and $ 201million as of March 31,\n2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nCash collateral totaled $ 5.8billion and $\n4.5billion, netted against derivative assets\nand liabilities, respectively, at March 31,\n2021, and $ 5.5billion and $ 7.5billion,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2020.\n                                \n  110    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nFair Value and Cash Flow Hedges For fair value\nhedges, we use interest rate swaps to convert\ncertain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and\ntime certificates of deposit to floating rates\nto hedge our exposure to interest rate risk.\nWe also enter into cross-currency swaps,\ncross-currency interest rate swaps and forward\ncontracts to hedge our exposure to foreign\ncurrency risk and interest rate risk\nassociated with the issuance of non-U.S.\ndollar denominated long-term debt. In\naddition, we use interest rate swaps, cross-\ncurrency swaps, cross-currency interest rate\nswaps and forward contracts to hedge against\nchanges in fair value of certain investments\nin available-for-sale debt securities due to\nchanges in interest rates, foreign currency\nrates, or both. For certain fair value hedges\nof foreign currency risk, changes in fair\nvalue of cross-currency swaps attributable to\nchanges in cross-currency basis spreads are\nexcluded from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and recorded in other\ncomprehensive income. See Note 21 (Other\nComprehensive Income) for the amounts\nrecognized in other comprehensive income. For\ncash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps\nto hedge the variability in interest payments\nreceived on certain floating- rate commercial\nloans, and paid on certain floating-rate debt\ndue to changes in the contractually specified\ninterest rate. We also use cross-currency\nswaps to hedge variability in interest\npayments on fixed-rate foreign currency-\ndenominated long-term debt due to changes in\nforeign exchange rates. We estimate $\n107million pre-tax of deferred net losses\nrelated to cash flow hedges in OCI at March\n31, 2021, will be reclassified into net\ninterest income during the next twelve months.\nThe deferred losses expected to be\nreclassified into net interest income are\npredominantly related to discontinued hedges\nof floating rate loans. For cash flow hedges\nas of March 31, 2021, we are hedging our\nforeign currency exposure to the variability\nof future cash flows for all forecasted\ntransactions for a maximum of 9years. For\nadditional information on our accounting\nhedges, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies).

Assets and liabilities recorded\nat fair value on a recurring basis, such as\nderivatives, residential MSRs, and trading or\nAFS debt securities, are presented in Table\n15.1 in this Note. Additionally, from time to\ntime, we record fair value adjustments on a\nnonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring\nadjustments typically involve application of\nlower of cost or fair value (LOCOM)\naccounting, write-downs of individual assets\nor application of the measurement alternative\nfor nonmarketable equity securities. Assets\nrecorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nare presented in Table 15.4 in this Note. We\nprovide in Table 15.8 estimates of fair value\nfor financial instruments that are not\nrecorded at fair value, such as loans and debt\nliabilities carried at amortized cost. See\nNote 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies) in our 2020 Form 10-K for discussion\nof how we determine fair value. For\ndescriptions of the valuation methodologies we\nuse for assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value on a recurring or nonrecurring\nbasis, see Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and\nLiabilities) in our 2020 Form 10-K. FAIR VALUE\nHIERARCHY We classify our assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair value as either\nLevel 1, 2, or 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to\nvaluations based on unadjusted quoted prices\nin active markets and the lowest priority\n(Level 3) is assigned to valuations based on\nsignificant unobservable inputs. See Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies)\nin our 2020 Form 10-K for a detailed\ndescription of the fair value hierarchy. In\nthe determination of the classification of\nfinancial instruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy, we consider all\navailable information, including observable\nmarket data, indications of market liquidity\nand orderliness, and our understanding of the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs\nused. This determination is ultimately based\nupon the specific facts and circumstances of\neach instrument or instrument category and\njudgments are made regarding the significance\nof the unobservable inputs to the instruments\u2019\nfair value measurement in its entirety. If\nunobservable inputs are considered\nsignificant, the instrument is classified as\nLevel 3. We do not classify nonmarketable\nequity securities in the fair value hierarchy\nif we use the non-published net asset value\n(NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a\npractical expedient to measure fair value.\nMarketable equity securities with published\nNAVs are classified in the fair value\nhierarchy.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    115  \n                                \nNote 15: Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities\n(continued)\n\nAssets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis Table 15.1 presents the\nbalances of assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value on a recurring basis.\n\nTable 15.1: Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Excludes $ 157million and $ 154million of\nnonmarketable equity securities as of March\n31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively,\nthat are measured at fair value using non-\npublished NAV per share (or its equivalent) as\na practical expedient that are not classified\nin the fair value hierarchy.\n\n(2) Represents balance sheet netting of\nderivative asset and liability balances,\nrelated cash collateral and portfolio level\ncounterparty valuation adjustments.

We may elect the\nfair value option to align the measurement\nmodel with how the financial assets or\nliabilities are managed or to reduce\ncomplexity or accounting asymmetry. Following\nis a discussion of the portfolios for which we\nelected the fair value option. For additional\ninformation, including the basis for our fair\nvalue option elections, see Note 17 (Fair\nValues of Assets and Liabilities) in our 2020\nForm 10-K. Table 15.7 reflects differences\nbetween the fair value carrying amount of the\nassets for which we have elected the fair\nvalue option and the contractual aggregate\nunpaid principal amount at maturity.\nNonaccrual loans and loans 90 days or more\npast due and still accruing included in LHFS\nwhich we have elected the fair value option\nwere insignificant at March 31, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020.\n\nTable 15.7: Fair Value Option\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n                                \n  120    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nThe changes in fair\nvalue related to\ninitial measurement\nand subsequent changes\nin fair value included\nin earnings for LHFS\naccounted for under\nthe fair value option\nwere $ 363million and\n$ 335million for the\nquarters ended March\n31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\nSubstantially all of\nthese amounts were\nincluded in the\nmortgage banking\nnoninterest income\nline of the\nconsolidated statement\nof income. For\nperforming loans,\ninstrument-specific\ncredit risk gains or\nlosses were derived\nprincipally by\ndetermining the change\nin fair value of the\nloans due to changes\nin the observable or\nimplied credit spread.\nCredit spread is the\nmarket yield on the\nloans less the\nrelevant risk-free\nbenchmark interest\nrate. For\nnonperforming loans,\nwe attribute all\nchanges in fair value\nto instrument-specific\ncredit risk.

management reporting is organized into\nfourreportable operating segments: Consumer\nBanking and Lending; Commercial Banking;\nCorporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth\nand Investment Management. All other business\nactivities that are not included in the\nreportable operating segments have been\nincluded in Corporate. We define our\nreportable operating segments by type of\nproduct and customer segment, and their\nresults are based on our management reporting\nprocess. The management reporting process\nmeasures the performance of the reportable\noperating segments based on the Company\u2019s\nmanagement structure, and the results are\nregularly reviewed by our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Operating Committee. The\nmanagement reporting process is based on U.S.\nGAAP and includes specific adjustments, such\nas funds transfer pricing for asset/liability\nmanagement, shared revenues and expenses, and\ntaxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently\nreflect income from taxable and tax-exempt\nsources, which allows management to assess\nperformance consistently across the operating\nsegments. In February 2021, we announced an\nagreement to sell Wells Fargo Asset Management\n(WFAM) and moved the business from the Wealth\nand Investment Management operating segment to\nCorporate. Prior period balances have been\nrevised to conform with the current period\npresentation. This change did not impact the\npreviously reported consolidated financial\nresults of the Company. Consumer Banking and\nLending offers diversified financial products\nand services for consumers and small\nbusinesses with annual sales generally up to $\n5million. These financial products and\nservices include checking and savings\naccounts, credit and debit cards, as well as\nhome, auto, personal, and small business\nlending. Commercial Banking provides financial\nsolutions to private, family owned and certain\npublic companies. Products and services\ninclude banking and credit products across\nmultiple industry sectors and municipalities,\nsecured lending and lease products, and\ntreasury management. Corporate and Investment\nBanking delivers a suite of capital markets,\nbanking, and financial products and services\nto corporate, commercial real estate,\ngovernment and institutional clients globally.\nProducts and services include corporate\nbanking, investment banking, treasury\nmanagement, commercial real estate lending and\nservicing, equity and fixed income solutions,\nas well as sales, trading, and research\ncapabilities. Wealth and Investment Management\nprovides personalized wealth management,\ninvestment and retirement products and\nservices to clients across U.S.-based\nbusinesses including Wells Fargo Advisors and\nThe Private Bank. We serve clients\u2019 brokerage\nneeds, and deliver financial planning, private\nbanking, credit, and fiduciary services to\nhigh-net worth and ultra-high-net worth\nindividuals and families. Corporate includes\ncorporate treasury and enterprise functions,\nnet of allocations (including funds transfer\npricing, capital, liquidity and certain\nexpenses), in support of the reportable\noperating segments, as well as our investment\nportfolio and affiliated venture capital and\nprivate equity partnerships. In addition,\nCorporate includes all restructuring charges\nrelated to our efficiency initiatives. See\nNote 19 (Restructuring Charges) for additional\ninformation on restructuring charges.\nCorporate also includes certain lines of\nbusiness that management has determined are no\nlonger consistent with the long-term strategic\ngoals of the Company, including our student\nloan business, rail car leasing business, and\nWFAM, as well as results for previously\ndivested businesses. Basis of Presentation\nFUNDS TRANSFER PRICING Corporate treasury\nmanages a funds transfer pricing methodology\nthat considers interest rate risk, liquidity\nrisk, and other product characteristics.\nOperating segments pay a funding charge for\ntheir assets and receive a funding credit for\ntheir deposits, both of which are included in\nnet interest income. The net impact of the\nfunding charges or credits is recognized in\ncorporate treasury. REVENUE AND EXPENSE\nSHARING When lines of business jointly serve\ncustomers, the line of business that is\nresponsible for providing the product or\nservice recognizes revenue or expense with a\nreferral fee paid or an allocation of cost to\nthe other line of business based on\nestablished internal revenue-sharing\nagreements. When a line of business uses a\nservice provided by another line of business\nor enterprise function (included in\nCorporate), expense is generally allocated\nbased on the cost and use of the service\nprovided. TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS\nTaxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-\nexempt income on certain loans and debt\nsecurities are included in net interest\nincome, while taxable-equivalent adjustments\nrelated to income tax credits for low-income\nhousing and renewable energy investments are\nincluded in noninterest income, in each case\nwith corresponding impacts to income tax\nexpense (benefit). Adjustments are included in\nCorporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate\nand Investment Banking and are eliminated to\nreconcile to the Company\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial results.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    131  \n                                \n                                              \n  Note 22:Operating Segments(continued)       \n                                              \nTable 22.1 presents our results by operating\nsegment.\nTable 22.1: Operating Segments\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to\ntax-exempt income on certain loans and debt\nsecurities are included in net interest\nincome, while taxable-equivalent adjustments\nrelated to income tax credits for low-income\nhousing and renewable energy investments are\nincluded in noninterest income, in each case\nwith corresponding impacts to income tax\nexpense (benefit).

The\nFRB establishes capital requirements for the\nconsolidated financial holding company, and\nthe OCC has similar requirements for the\nCompany\u2019s national banks, including Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A. (the Bank). Table 23.1\npresents regulatory capital information for\nWells Fargo & Company and the Bank in\naccordance with Basel III capital\nrequirements. Our capital adequacy is assessed\nbased on the lower of our risk-based capital\nratios calculated under the Standardized\nApproach and under the Advanced Approach. The\nStandardized Approach applies assigned risk\nweights to broad risk categories, while the\ncalculation of risk-weighted assets (RWAs)\nunder the Advanced Approach differs by\nrequiring applicable banks to utilize a risk-\nsensitive methodology, which relies upon the\nuse of internal credit models, and includes an\noperational risk component. The Basel III\ncapital requirements for calculating Common\nEquity Tier 1 (CET1) and tier 1 capital, along\nwith RWAs, are fully phased-in. However, the\nrequirements for determining tier 2 and total\ncapital are still in accordance with\ntransition requirements and are scheduled to\nbe fully phased-in by the end of 2021.\nAccordingly, the information presented below\nreflects fully phased-in CET1 capital, tier 1\ncapital, and RWAs, but reflects total capital\nstill in accordance with transition\nrequirements. At March 31, 2021, the Bank and\nour other insured depository institutions were\nconsidered well-capitalized under the\nrequirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nAct.\nTable 23.1: Regulatory Capital Information (1)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n*Denotes the binding ratio based on the lower\ncalculation under the Advanced and\nStandardized Approaches.\n(1) At March 31, 2021, the impact of the CECL\ntransition provision issued by federal banking\nregulators on the regulatory capital of the\nCompany was an increase in capital of $\n1.3billion, reflecting a $ 991million (post-\ntax) increase in capital recognized upon our\ninitial adoption of CECL, offset by 25% of the\n$ 9.2billion increase in our ACL under CECL\nfrom January 1, 2020, through March 31, 2021.\nThe impact of the CECL transition provision on\nthe regulatory capital of the Bank at March\n31, 2021, was an increase in capital of $\n1.3billion.\n(2) RWAs for the Company and the Bank included\nan increase of $ 1.0billion under the\nStandardized Approach and decreases of $\n1.4billion and $ 1.3billion, respectively,\nunder the Advanced Approach related to the\nimpact of the CECL transition provision on the\nexcess allowance for credit losses as of March\n31, 2021.\n(3) The SLR consists of tier 1 capital divided\nby total leverage exposure. Total leverage\nexposure consists of total average assets,\nless goodwill and other permitted tier 1\ncapital deductions (net of deferred tax\nliabilities), plus certain off-balance sheet\nexposures.\n(4) In 2020, the FRB issued an interim final\nrule that temporarily allowed the exclusion\nfor on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and deposits at Federal Reserve\nBanks from the calculation of total leverage\nexposure in the denominator of the SLR. The\nCompany adopted this interim final rule, but\nthe Bank did not elect to apply these\nexclusions. The interim final rule expired on\nApril 1, 2021.\n(5) The tier 1 leverage ratio consists of tier\n1 capital divided by total average assets,\nexcluding goodwill and certain other items as\ndetermined under the rule.\nAt March 31, 2021, under transition\nrequirements, the CET1, tier 1 and total\ncapital ratio requirements for the Company\nincluded a global systemically important bank\n(G-SIB) surcharge of 2.00%. The G-SIB\nsurcharge is not applicable to the Bank. In\naddition, the CET1, tier 1 and total capital\nratio requirements for the Company and the\nBank included a stress capital buffer of 2.50%\nunder the Standardized Approach and a capital\nconservation buffer of 2.50% under the\nAdvanced Approach. The Company is required to\nmaintain these risk-based capital ratios and\nto maintain an SLR of at least 5.00%\n(comprised of a 3.00% minimum requirement plus\na supplementary leverage buffer of 2.00%) to\navoid restrictions on capital distributions\nand discretionary bonus payments. The Bank is\nrequired to maintain an SLR of at least 6.00%\nto be considered well-capitalized under\napplicable regulatory capital adequacy rules.\nTable 23.2 presents the risk-based capital and\nleverage requirements under\ntransition\nrequirements to which\nthe Company and the\nBank were subject as\nof March 31, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020,\nwhich were the same\nunder both the\nStandardized and\nAdvanced Approaches.\nTable 23.2: Risk-Based\nCapital and Leverage\nRatios \u2013 Transition\nRequirements\n                                              \n                                     Wells    \n                   Wells             Fargo    \n                   Fargo &           Bank,    \n                   Company           N.A.     \n                   Mar 31,           Mar 31,  \n                   2021              2021     \n                   and Dec           and Dec  \n                   31,               31,      \n                   2020              2020     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Common                                      \n  Equity     9.00  %           7.00           \n  Tier 1                                      \n  capit\u2026                                      \n  Tier 1    10.50              8.50           \n  capit\u2026                                      \n  Total     12.50             10.50           \n  capit\u2026                                      \n  Tier 1     4.00              4.00           \n  lever\u2026                                      \n  Suppl\u2026     5.00              6.00           \n  lever\u2026                                      \n                                              \n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    133  \n                                \nNote 23: Regulatory\nCapital Requirements\nand Other Restrictions\n(continued)\n\nCapital Planning\nRequirements The FRB\u2019s\nc apital plan rule\nestablishes capital\nplanning and other\nrequirements that\ngovern capital\ndistributions,\nincluding dividends\nand share repurchases,\nby certain large bank\nholding companies\n(BHCs), including\nWells Fargo. The FRB\nconducts an annual\nComprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review\nexercise and has also\npublished guidance\nregarding its\nsupervisory\nexpectations for\ncapital planning,\nincluding capital\npolicies regarding the\nprocess relating to\ncommon stock dividend\nand repurchase\ndecisions in the FRB\u2019s\nSR Letter 15-18. The\nParent\u2019s ability to\nmake certain capital\ndistributions is\nsubject to the\nrequirements of the\ncapital plan rule and\nis also subject to the\nParent meeting or\nexceeding certain\nregulatory capital\nminimums. On March 25,\n2021, the FRB\nannounced that it was\nextending measures it\npreviously announced\nlimiting large BHCs,\nincluding Wells Fargo,\nfrom making any\ncapital distribution\n(excluding any capital\ndistribution arising\nfrom the issuance of a\ncapital instrument\neligible for inclusion\nin the numerator of a\nregulatory capital\nratio), unless\notherwise approved by\nthe FRB. The FRB has\ngenerally authorized\nBHCs to (i) provided\nthat the BHC does not\nincrease the amount of\nits common stock\ndividends to be larger\nthan the level paid in\nsecond quarter 2020,\npay common stock\ndividends and make\nshare repurchases\nthat, in the\naggregate, do not\nexceed an amount equal\nto the average of the\nBHC\u2019s net income for\nthe four preceding\ncalendar quarters;\n(ii) make share\nrepurchases that equal\nthe amount of share\nissuances related to\nexpensed employee\ncompensation; and\n(iii) redeem and make\nscheduled payments on\nadditional tier 1 and\ntier 2 capital\ninstruments. The FRB\nhas also announced\nthat if a BHC remains\nabove all of its\nminimum risk-based\ncapital requirements\nin this year's\nsupervisory stress\ntest, these additional\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions will end\nfor that BHC after\nJune 30, 2021.\nHowever, a BHC that\nfalls below any of its\nminimum risk-based\ncapital requirements\nin this year's\nsupervisory stress\ntest will remain\nsubject to the\nadditional limitations\non capital\ndistributions through\nSeptember 30, 2021,\nand if the BHC remains\nbelow the capital\nrequired by the\nsupervisory stress\ntest at that time, the\nexisting stress\ncapital buffer\nframework will impose\neven stricter capital\ndistribution\nlimitations.\n\nLoan and Dividend\nRestrictions\n\nFederal law restricts\nthe amount and the\nterms of both credit\nand non-credit\ntransactions between a\nbank and its nonbank\naffiliates.\nAdditionally, federal\nlaws and regulations\nlimit the dividends\nthat a national bank\nmay pay.\n\nOur nonbank\nsubsidiaries are also\nlimited by certain\nfederal and state\nstatutory provisions\nand regulations\ncovering the amount of\ndividends that may be\npaid in any given\nyear.
