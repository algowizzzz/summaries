Scharf  \n  CEO                \n                     \n1\n\nLetter to our Shareholders\n\nfrom our Chairman of the Board\n\nMarch 16,\n2021\n\nDear Fellow Shareholders,\n\nI became\nChairman of the Wells Fargo Board of Directors\nin March 2020, just days before the world\nbegan to recognize the severity of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the pandemic\non families, communities, and\nbusinesses has been substantial. The people of\nWells Fargo have worked tirelessly to support\nour customers, employees, and communities by\nimplementing a broad range of actions and\ninitiatives. Despite the unprecedented\ncircumstances, we have\ncontinued the work necessary to move Wells\nFargo forward, including in response to the\npandemic. As we approach the spring of 2021\nand the availability of vaccines increases, we\nare hopeful that all of us can return to some\ndegree of normality by\nthe end of 2021.\n\nThe Board named Charlie Scharf CEO in\nSeptember 2019 and, since joining the Company\nin October 2019, Charlie has conducted an\nextensive\nreview of the Company\u0092s businesses, operating\nmodel, and strategy, and he has made\nsignificant changes to position the Company to\nbe more efficient and effective. He has\nintroduced a flatter organizational structure\nwith improved reporting,\nelevated strong internal talent, brought in\npeople from other organizations who have\nexperience leading transformational change,\nand provided our management team with clear\nauthority and responsibility. In consultation\nwith the Board, Charlie has\nset clear priorities for the team and is\ndriving our top priority \u0097 to continue\nstrengthening the Company\u0092s risk and control\nfoundation and addressing outstanding\nregulatory matters \u0097 with a sense of urgency.\n\nA multiyear effort is underway to make Wells\nFargo a better and more efficient company,\nincluding by reducing third-party spend,\nconsolidating locations and\noperational platforms, focusing on identifying\nand developing our core businesses, and\napplying technology differently. Our\nbusinesses are working to leverage data more\neffectively to provide customers with useful\nguidance to enable them to make\nbetter-informed financial decisions, and to\nprovide the tools that make doing business\nwith Wells Fargo simpler, easier, and more\nconvenient.\n\nThe Board\nand its Human Resources Committee are fully\nengaged in overseeing Wells Fargo\u0092s diversity,\nequity, and inclusion initiatives and human\ncapital management to support management in\nits efforts to drive meaningful change.\nProgress in these areas\nwas evaluated and taken into consideration by\nthe Board and the Human Resources Committee as\npart of year-end compensation decisions for\nCharlie and our other executive officers.\n\nThe Board and the Company have consistently\nacted to enhance our governance practices and\ntransparency through disclosures in response\nto the perspectives of\nour shareholders and other stakeholders. The\nBoard\u0092s Corporate Responsibility Committee\noversees the Company\u0092s significant strategies,\npolicies, and programs on social and public\nresponsibility\n\n2\n\nmatters, including environmental\nsustainability and climate change. The Board\nand the Corporate Responsibility Committee\nwere actively engaged in the Company\u0092s recent\ndecision to set the ambitious goal of net-\nzerogreenhouse gas emissions in the Company\u0092s\nfinanced emissions by 2050. We continue to\noversee and support management in the\nCompany\u0092s increased reporting on important ESG\ntopics such as the publication earlier this\nyear of the Company\u0092s inaugural Task Force on\nClimate-Related Financial Disclosures report.\nSince becoming Chairman, I have spent a\nsignificant amount of time meeting with a\nnumber of our shareholders, and I have\nappreciated the opportunity to hear their\nfeedback about Wells Fargo. We understand that\nthe Company\u0092s performance has suffered from\nboth the effects of the pandemic and our\nhistorical issues. The Board, which has been\nlargely reconstituted over the past several\nyears \u0097 including with the addition of two new\ndirectors in 2020 with extensive banking\nexpertise \u0097 is focused on helping the Company\nrealize its full potential. We have a diverse\ngroup of skilled directors with fresh\nperspectives and significant experience who\nare dedicated to the Company\u0092s success. There\nis a lot of work ahead, but we remain\nconfident about the underlying strength of our\nCompany\u0092s franchise, the soundness and\ndirection of our strategy to improve\noperational and financial performance, and the\nCompany\u0092s ability to achieve our goal of\nmaking Wells Fargo the preeminent provider of\nfinancial services in the U.S. On behalf of\nWells Fargo, we would like to thank Don James,\nwho is not standing for reelection this year\nand is retiring from our Board in April\nfollowing more than a decade of service. We\nappreciate his contributions to Wells Fargo.\nWe are pleased to invite you to attend our\n2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on April\n27, 2021, at 10 a.m. Eastern time. As in 2020,\nthis year\u0092s annual meeting will be held\nvirtually in order to protect the health and\nsafety of our shareholders, employees,\ndirectors, and other meeting participants. We\nhad more participants and the opportunity to\nanswer more questions at last year\u0092s annual\nmeeting than in previous years, and we again\nlook forward to an informative and engaging\nmeeting for our shareholders. Thank you for\nyour continued investment in and support of\nWells Fargo. Sincerely,\n                         \n  Charles H.

economy by       \n  setting a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas   \n  emissions                                   \n  \u0096 including our financed emissions \u0096 by       \n  2050. To help meet this ambitious goal,     \n  Wells Fargo will, among other things,       \n  measure and disclose financed emissions     \n  for select carbon-intensive portfolios;     \n  set interim emission reduction              \n  targets; deploy more capital to finance     \n  climate innovation; and continue to work    \n  with our clients on their own emissions     \n  reductions efforts. Wells Fargo also will   \n  launch an Institute for Sustainable         \n  Finance to manage the deployment of         \n  $500\u00a0billion of financing to sustainable    \n  businesses and projects by 2030.            \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009Published Wells Fargo\u0092s inaugural Task     \n  Force on                                    \n  Climate-Related Financial Disclosures       \n  (TCFD) Report in February 2021, available   \n  at                                          \n  https://www.wellsfargo.com/assets/pdf/abo\u2026  \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009Reorganized our management reporting      \n  into four                                   \n  reportable operating segments: Consumer     \n  Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking,    \n  Corporate and Investment Banking, and       \n  Wealth and Investment Management            \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009Published updates on the Company\u0092s         \n  progress,                                   \n  including leadership changes,               \n  organizational improvements, culture        \n  transformation, and our support of          \n  customers, in Wells Fargo: Charting a New   \n  Future available at                         \n  https://stories.wf.com/new-future           \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009Enhanced our 2020 ESG disclosure          \n  (available on the                           \n  Corporate Responsibility Goals and          \n  Reporting page of our website at            \n  https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/corporat\u2026  \n  to better meet stakeholder expectations,    \n  including through publication of:           \n  \u00a1\u2002\u200aCorporate Responsibility Highlights,     \n  which summarize key ESG progress and        \n  activities from 2019                        \n  \u00a1\u2002\u200aOur 2020 ESG Report, ESG Goals and       \n  Performance Data, and GRI/SASB Index which  \n  include disclosure on progress toward 2020  \n  goals,                                      \n  3-year data trends, linkage to GRI and      \n  SASB indicators, customer satisfaction,     \n  privacy, data security, health and safety,  \n  human capital, and EEO-1 percentage         \n  information                                 \n  \u00a1                                           \n  Our Issue Brief on Climate Change           \n  disclosing our support of the principles    \n  of the Paris Agreement and actions Wells    \n  Fargo is taking to embed sustainability     \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009Agreed in August 2020 to publish          \n  consolidated EEO-1                          \n  gender/race employment data in 2021         \n                                              \n* See pages 10-11 for extended timeline\n                             \n  2021 Proxy Statement    v  \n                             \nOur Compensation\nPrinciples and\nDisciplined\nPerformance Assessment\nFramework\n\nCompensation\nPrinciples Our\nexecutive compensation\nprograms are designed\nand administered in\naccordance with\nestablished\ncompensation\nprinciples, each of\nwhich is an essential\ncomponent to driving\nstrong, risk-managed\nperformance.\nConsistent with the\nprinciples below,\nincentive compensation\nis designed to\nmotivate executives to\nachieve short-,\nmedium-, and long-term\nperformance that\ngenerates sustained\nshareholder value.\nBoth the annual cash\nbonus and the long-\nterm equity components\nof incentive\ncompensation awarded\nare determined based\non the prior year\u0092s\nperformance.

The HRC views executive\ncompensation as instrumental in our ability\nto drive shareholder value through plans and\nprograms that reinforce shared success, serve\nto attract the talent needed to effectively\ndevelop and execute on our strategic\npriorities, align the interests of executives\nwith those of shareholders through incentive\nplans that drive short-, medium-, and long-\nterm value, and to discourage imprudent risk-\ntaking and hold individuals accountable, as\nappropriate. We believe our executive\ncompensation program and its resulting\nrealizable pay for named executives\ndemonstrates our strong commitment to linking\ncompensation to Company performance and our\nstrategic goals. The HRC will continue to\nactively monitor this alignment.\n                               \n  vi    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nExecutive Compensation Decision Highlights\n2020 Company Performance Our financial\nperformance in 2020 was challenged by both\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and the necessary work\nto put our substantial legacy issues behind\nus. The pandemic increased our expenses and\nreduced revenue as we took actions to protect\nthe safety of both our employees and\ncustomers while continuing to carry out the\nCompany\u0092s role as a provider of essential\nservices to our communities. For additional\ninformation on significant drivers of our\n2020 financial performance, see pages 69-70\nof our Compensation Discussion and Analysisin\nthis proxy statement. The impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u0092s financial\nresults resulted in the Company not meeting\n2020 threshold goals under the Company\u0092s\nannual bonus plan (Bonus Plan). The HRC has\nhistorically established threshold goals as a\nfactor to be evaluated along with other\nfinancial and non-financial performance\nconsiderations for the funding and payment of\ncash bonuses under the Bonus Plan. In\naddition to a broader population of\nemployees, named executives participated in\nthe Bonus Plan for 2020. After review and\nconsideration of overall Company performance,\nincluding financial and non-financial\nelements, the HRC determined that application\nof threshold goals was not appropriate for\n2020 or a meaningful measure of Company\nperformance. In making that determination,\nthe HRC considered, among other factors:\n                                              \n      Company financial results for 2020,     \n      which were significantly impacted by    \n      the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on  \n      economic and                            \n      market conditions                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      Actions taken by the Company in         \n      response to the COVID-19 pandemic to    \n      support employees, customers, and       \n      communities all while                   \n      making demonstrable progress on         \n      addressing risk, control and            \n      regulatory issues                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      The importance in retaining and         \n      motivating the executive and broader    \n      employee talent needed to advance the   \n      Company\u0092s                                \n      transformation and achieve its other    \n      strategic priorities                    \n                                              \nCompensation is Aligned with Company and\nIndividual Performance Compensation decisions\nfor the 2020 performance year reflect the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our\nfinancial performance as well as the\nnecessary work to address our legacy issues:\n                                              \n      Company performance assessed at 75% of  \n      target.

This        \n      change focuses our                      \n      senior leaders on improving the         \n      Company\u0092s absolute financial             \n      performance, while encouraging          \n      long-term decision-making related to    \n      building out our risk and control       \n      infrastructure, rebuilding trust with   \n      customers, and improving our            \n      efficiency.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      Adopted a New Clawback Policy.

Company\nperformance reduced Mr. Scharf\u0092s annual cash\nand long-term equity compensation awarded for\nperformance year 2020. In assessing Mr.\nScharf\u0092s individual performance, the Board\nconsidered, among other factors, his\nincreased focus on advancing diversity,\nequity, and inclusion, and his prioritization\nof progress on regulatory work.\n                                              \n      For 2020, the Board awarded half of     \n      Mr. Scharf\u0092s long-term equity            \n      compensation in the form of             \n      Performance Shares Awards               \n      (PSAs) and the other half in            \n      Restricted Share Rights (RSRs).

The HRC believes      \n      that a mix of performance-based and     \n      time-vested equity is consistent with   \n      Labor Market Peer Group practices,      \n      appropriately balances driving          \n      long-term Company performance, and      \n      serves as an appropriate retention      \n      vehicle.

role in the\nevaluation, which is a multi-step process\ninvolving, among other things, individual\ndirector feedback and Board discussions\nregarding the CEO\u0092s performance and\ndiscussions with the CEO regarding his\nassessment of his own performance. Our\nindependent Chairman participates, along with\nother directors, in the CEO performance\nevaluation and in the Board\u0092s review of\nmanagement succession and development plans.\nHis participation in those processes help him\nevaluate the most effective Board leadership\nstructure for our Company. In addition, our\nindependent Chairman\u0092s and other independent\ndirectors\u0092 participation in our Company\u0092s\ninvestor engagement program, engagement with\nour regulators, as well as facilitation of\nour Board\u0092s review and consideration of\nshareholder proposals provide valuable\ninsight into the views of our investors and\nother stakeholders regarding our Company\u0092s\ncorporate governance practices, including its\nBoard leadership structure. Our Board\nbelieves that these and the other activities\nof the independent Chairman serve to enhance\nthe independent leadership and oversight of\nour Board.\n                              \n  2021 Proxy Statement    13  \n                              \nCorporate Governance Management Succession\nPlanning and Development A primary\nresponsibility of our Board is identifying and\ndeveloping executive talent at our Company,\nparticularly the CEO and other senior leaders\nof our Company. The Board has assigned to the\nHRC, as set forth in its charter, the\nresponsibility to oversee the Company\u0092s talent\nmanagement and succession planning process,\nincluding CEO evaluation and succession\nplanning. The Board\u0092s Corporate Governance\nGuidelines require that the CEO and management\nannually report to the HRC and the Board on\nsuccession planning (including plans in the\nevent of an emergency) and management\ndevelopment. The Corporate Governance\nGuidelines also require that the CEO and\nmanagement provide the HRC and Board with an\nassessment of persons considered potential\nsuccessors to certain senior management\npositions at least once each year. The Board\nengages in an annual succession planning\nprocess through which it identifies potential\nmanagement successors. In addition, in light\nof the COVID-19pandemic, the HRC and the Board\nconducted emergency succession planning for\nthe CEO and other key executive roles in March\n2020 and has continued to assess those\nemergency succession plans as part of ongoing\nsuccession planning processes. Beginning in\n2021, our talent review process for senior\nmanagement roles will include diverse talent\nreviews for business and enterprise function\ngroups across the Company. As part of talent\nand succession planning, the Board uses\ndefined attributes for the qualities the Board\nseeks in the CEO of the Company and other\nsenior leaders. The HRC and the Board annually\nassess and update, as appropriate, those\nattributes as part of our succession planning\nprocess.\n                               \n  14    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nCorporate Governance\n\nBoard Composition Board Succession Planning\nOver the past few years, our Board\u0092s\nsuccession planning has focused on the\ncomposition of our Board and its committees,\nupcoming retirements under our director\nretirement policy, succession plans for\ncommittee chairs and committee members, our\ncommitment to Board diversity, and recruiting\nstrategies for adding new directors,\nincluding with banking and financial services\nexperience. In its succession planning, the\nGNC and our Board consider the results of our\nBoard\u0092s annual self-evaluation, as well as\nother appropriate information, including the\ntypes of skills and experience desirable for\nfuture Board members and the needs of our\nBoard and its committees at the time in light\nof the Company\u0092s strategy, risk appetite, and\nrisk profile. Board Succession Planning\nFramework Our Board conducts formal\nsuccession planning annually and has adopted\na Board Succession Planning Framework to\nassist the Board in its annual succession\nplanning. That framework provides for\nconsideration of succession planning for the\nBoard as well as succession planning for the\nindependent Chairman and Board committee\nchairs to enable the Board to maintain a\ncomposition and structure aligned to the\nCompany\u0092s needs at the time. As part of\nsuccession planning framework, the Board\nconsiders how current and evolving risks may\ncreate needs for particular qualifications\nand experience on the Board and its\ncommittees, including relevant banking, bank\nregulatory, and financial services\nexperience. The GNC and the Board use various\ntools for succession planning, including to\nreview upcoming director retirements under\nthe Board\u0092s director retirement policy,\nindividual director tenure, average director\ntenure, and the tenure of each director\u0092s\nservice on Board committees and in committee\nchair roles.\n                                              \n  Director Tenure and Retirement Age          \n  Policies                                    \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009The Board\u0092s Corporate Governance           \n  Guidelines reflect its recognition of the   \n  importance of periodic Board refreshment    \n  and maintaining an appropriate balance of   \n  tenure, experience, and perspectives on     \n  the Board.                                  \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009The Board values the contributions of     \n  both newer perspectives as well as          \n  directors who have developed extensive      \n  experience and insight into the Company,    \n  and as a result does not believe arbitrary  \n  term limits are appropriate.                \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009The Board believes that directors should  \n  not have an expectation of being            \n  renominated annually and that the Board\u0092s    \n  annual self-evaluation is a key component   \n  of its director nomination process.         \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009In connection with the Board\u0092s annual      \n  self-evaluation and director                \n  nomination processes, the Board considers   \n  at least annually upcoming retirements      \n  under its director retirement policies,     \n  the average tenure and overall mix of       \n  individual director tenures of the Board,   \n  the overall mix of the diverse skills,      \n  knowledge, experience, and perspectives of  \n  directors, each individual director\u0092s        \n  performance and contributions to the work   \n  of the Board and its committees, the        \n  personal circumstances and other time       \n  commitments of directors, along with other  \n  factors the Board deems appropriate. \u00a0 \u0095\u2002\u2009   \n  Our Board established the retirement age    \n  of 72 for directors with the understanding  \n  that directors may not necessarily serve    \n  until their retirement age. Our Board\u0092s      \n  retirement age policy is intended           \n  to facilitate our Board\u0092s recruitment of     \n  new directors with appropriate skills,      \n  experience, and backgrounds and provide     \n  for an orderly transition of leadership on  \n  our Board and its committees.               \n                                              \n                              \n  2021 Proxy Statement    15  \n                              \nCorporate Governance\n\nOverall Board Composition and Size The\nBoard\u0092s current composition has resulted from\na thoughtful process informed by the Board\u0092s\nown evaluation of its composition and\neffectiveness and feedback received from the\nCompany\u0092s engagement with shareholders and\nother stakeholders. As part of Board\nsuccession planning, the Board seeks to add\nnew directors that complement the overall\nskills and capabilities of the Board. The\nBoard has nominated 12 director nominees for\nelection at the 2021 annual meeting and set\nthe size of the Board at 12 directors. As\npart of Board succession planning, the size\nof the Board may fluctuate over time.

The GNC\nalso incorporates this broad view of diversity\ninto its director nomination process by taking\ninto account all of the factors above, in\naddition to having a diverse candidate pool\nfor each director search the Board undertakes,\nwhen evaluating and recommending director\nnominees to serve on our Board so that our\nBoard\u0092s composition as a whole appropriately\nreflects the current and anticipated needs of\nour Board and our Company. In implementing its\npractice of considering diversity, the GNC may\nplace more emphasis on attracting or retaining\ndirector nominees with certain specific skills\nor experience, such as industry, regulatory,\noperational, or financial expertise, depending\non the circumstances and the composition of\nour Board at the time. Gender, race, and\nethnic diversity also have been, and will\ncontinue to be, a priority for the GNC and our\nBoard in its director nomination process\nbecause the GNC and our Board believe that it\nis essential that the composition of our Board\nappropriately reflects the diversity of our\nCompany\u0092s employees and the customers and\ncommunities we serve. The GNC considers the\nself-identified diversity characteristics of\neach director or potential director candidate.\nThe GNC believes that it has been successful\nin its efforts over the years to promote\ngender, race, and ethnic diversity on our\nBoard. The GNC and our Board believe that our\ndirector nominees for election at our 2021\nannual meeting bring to our Board a variety of\ndifferent backgrounds, skills, professional\nand industry experience, and other personal\nqualities, attributes, and perspectives that\ncontribute to the overall diversity of our\nBoard. The charts below show the diversity of\nour director nominees. The Board expects to\nmaintain its focus on the importance of Board\ndiversity as well as desired qualifications\nand experience identified by the Board in\nfuture director recruitment efforts. The GNC\nand our Board will continue to monitor the\neffectiveness of their practice of considering\ndiversity through assessing the results of any\nnew director search efforts, and through the\nGNC\u0092s and our Board\u0092s annual self-evaluation\nprocesses in which directors discuss and\nevaluate the composition and functioning of\nour Board and its committees.\n                              \n  2021 Proxy Statement    19  \n                              \nCorporate Governance Item 1 \u0096 Election of\nDirectors Our Board plays a critical role in\nprotecting and serving the interests of\nshareholders and meeting the expectations of\nour regulators and other stakeholders.

Under this\nstandard, a nominee for director will be\nelected to our Board if the votes cast for\nthe nominee exceed the votes cast against the\nnominee. However, directors will be elected\nby a plurality of the votes cast in a\ncontested election. Under Delaware law,\ndirectors continue in office until their\nsuccessors are elected and qualified or until\ntheir earlier resignation or removal. Our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines provide that\nour Board will nominate for election and\nappoint to fill Board vacancies only those\ndirectors who have tendered or agreed to\ntender an advance, irrevocable resignation\nthat would become effective upon their\nfailure to receive the required vote for\nelection and Board acceptance of the tendered\nresignation. Each director nominee named in\nthis proxy statement has tendered an\nirrevocable resignation as a director in\naccordance with our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines, which resignation will become\neffective if he or she fails to receive the\nrequired vote for election at the annual\nmeeting and our Board accepts his or her\nresignation. Our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines also provide that the GNC will\nconsider the tendered resignation of a\ndirector who fails to receive the required\nnumber of votes for election, as well as any\nother offer to resign that is conditioned\nupon Board acceptance, and recommend to our\nBoard whether or not to accept such\nresignation. The GNC, in deciding what action\nto recommend, and our Board, in deciding what\naction to take, may consider any factors they\ndeem relevant. The director whose resignation\nis under consideration will abstain from\nparticipating in any decision of the GNC or\nour Board regarding such resignation. If our\nBoard does not accept the resignation, the\ndirector will continue to serve until his or\nher successor is elected and qualified. Our\nBoard will publicly disclose its decision on\nthe resignation within 90 days after\ncertification of the voting results. Director\nNomination Process GNC Leadership of the\nDirector Nomination Process The GNC is\nresponsible for leading the director\nnomination process, which includes\nidentifying, evaluating, and recommending for\nnomination candidates for election as new\ndirectors and directors, regardless of who\nnominates a candidate for consideration. The\ngoal of the GNC\u0092s nominating process is to\nassist our Board in attracting and retaining\ncompetent individuals with the requisite\nleadership, executive management, financial,\nindustry, and other expertise who will act as\ndirectors in the best interests of our\nCompany and its shareholders. The GNC\nregularly reviews the composition of our\nBoard in light of its understanding of the\nbackgrounds, industry, professional\nexperience, personal qualities and\nattributes, and various geographic and\ndemographic communities represented by\ncurrent members. As discussed above, the GNC\nalso oversees our Board\u0092s self-evaluation\nprocess. Identification and Assessment of\nDirector Candidates The GNC identifies\npotential candidates for first-time\nnomination as a director through various\nsources, including recommendations it\nreceives from the following:\n                                 \n      Third-party search firms,  \n                                 \n                      \n      Board members,  \n                      \n                                              \n      Leaders and other participants in the   \n      financial services industry,            \n                                              \n                                              \n      Shareholders and other stakeholders,    \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                             \n      Contacts in the communities we serve.  \n                                             \nThe GNC has the authority to engage a third\nparty search firm to identify and provide\ninformation on potential candidates. A key\nobjective of the GNC in connection with its\nidentification of potential director\ncandidates is to use multiple sources and\nactively seek out qualified women and\nethnically diverse candidates in order to\nhave a diverse candidate pool for each search\nthe Board undertakes. Mark A. Chancy, who\nbecame a director in August 2020, was\nrecommended to the GNC for consideration by a\nthird party search firm engaged by the GNC.\nIn addition to providing information on a\nnumber of potential director candidates, the\nthird party search firm reviewed and provided\ninformation about Mr. Chancy for review by\nthe GNC and our Board.\n                              \n  2021 Proxy Statement    27  \n                              \nCorporate Governance\n\nWhen the GNC has identified a potential new\ndirector nominee, it obtains publicly\navailable information on the background of\nthe potential nominee to make an initial\nassessment of the candidate in light of the\nfollowing factors:\n                                              \n      Whether the individual meets our        \n      Board-approved minimum qualifications   \n      for director nominees described under   \n      Board                                   \n      Qualifications and Experience;          \n                                              \n                                              \n      Whether there are any apparent          \n      conflicts of interest in the            \n      individual serving on our Board; and    \n                                              \n                                              \n      Whether the individual would be         \n      considered independent under our        \n      Director Independence Standards, which  \n      are described under                     \n      Director Independence.                  \n                                              \nThe GNC determines, in its sole discretion\nafter considering all factors it considers\nappropriate, whether a potential new director\nnominee meets the Board\u0092s minimum\nqualifications and also considers the\ncomposition of the entire Board taking into\naccount the particular qualifications,\nskills, experience, and attributes that our\nBoard believes are important to our Company\nsuch as those described under Board\nQualifications and Experience . If a\ncandidate passes this initial review, the GNC\narranges introductory meetings with the\ncandidate and our independent Chairman, the\nGNC chair, and the CEO to discuss the\ncandidate\u0092s background and determine the\ncandidate\u0092s interest in serving on our Board.\nIf determined appropriate by the independent\nChairman and GNC chair and if the candidate\nis interested in serving on our Board, the\nGNC arranges additional meetings with members\nof the GNC and other members of our Board.\nThe candidate also may meet with Company\nexecutives, including as part of the\ncandidate\u0092s consideration of potentially\njoining our Board. If our Board and the\ncandidate are both still interested in\nproceeding, the candidate provides us\nadditional information for use in determining\nwhether the candidate satisfies the\napplicable requirements of our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, Code of Ethics and\nBusiness Conduct, and any other rules,\nregulations, or policies applicable to\nmembers of our Board and its committees and\nfor making any required disclosures in our\nproxy statement. Assuming a satisfactory\nconclusion to the process outlined above, the\nGNC then presents the candidate\u0092s name for\napproval by our Board or for nomination for\napproval by the shareholders at the next\nshareholders\u0092 meeting, as applicable. Board\nNomination Process In addition, as discussed\nunder Comprehensive Annual Evaluation of\nBoard Effectiveness ,the GNC considers the\nresults of the Board\u0092s annual self-\nevaluation, including the individual\ncontributions of directors to the work of the\nBoard and its committees, in connection with\nits determination to nominate existing\ndirectors for election at each annual meeting\nof shareholders. As reflected in our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines and discussed\nunder Board Compositionabove, our Board has\nestablished a retirement age of 72 for\ndirectors. Under that retirement age policy,\nnon-managementdirectors will not be nominated\nfor election for a term that would begin\nafter the director\u0092s 72 ndbirthday, although\nthe GNC may recommend and the Board may\napprove the nomination of a non-\nmanagementdirector after the age of 72 if,\ndue to special or unique circumstances, it is\nin the best interests of the Company and its\nshareholders that the director continue to be\nnominated for reelection to the Board. One of\nthe Board\u0092s director nominees, Richard B.\nPayne, Jr., will be age 73 at the time of the\nCompany\u0092s 2021 annual meeting. Consistent\nwith our disclosure made at the time Mr.\nPayne was initially elected to the Board in\nOctober 2019 and in connection with the\nBoard\u0092s nomination of him for election by\nshareholders at our 2020\n                               \n  28    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nCorporate Governance\n\nannual meeting, the Board, based on the\nrecommendation of the GNC, determined to\nnominate Mr. Payne for election at the 2021\nannual meeting to serve as a director of the\nCompany in light of the particular skills and\nexperience that he brings to the Board. In\ndetermining that Mr. Payne\u0092s nomination is in\nthe best interests of the Company and its\nshareholders, the Board considered, among\nother factors, his substantial corporate and\ncommercial banking experience, extensive\nknowledge of the bank regulatory environment\nfor large financial institutions, and credit\nexpertise.

Our new\ndirector orientation program is led by\nmembers of senior management, in consultation\nwith the independent Chairman of our Board\nand each of our new directors, and covers a\nreview of our five principal lines of\nbusiness, strategic plan, financial\nstatements, and policies, risk management\nframework and significant risks, regulatory\nmatters, corporate governance and key\npolicies and practices (including our Code of\nEthics and Business Conduct), as well as the\nroles and responsibilities of our directors.\nOngoing Director Training The Board and its\ncommittees participate in and receive various\nforms of training and education throughout\nthe year, including business update sessions;\nmanagement presentations on the Company\u0092s\nbusinesses, services, and products; and\ninformation on industry trends, regulatory\ndevelopments, best practices, and emerging\nrisks in the financial services industry.\nOther educational and reference materials on\ngovernance, regulatory, risk, and other\nrelevant topics are regularly included in\nBoard and committee meeting materials and\nmaintained in an electronic library available\nto directors.\n                              \n  2021 Proxy Statement    29  \n                              \nCorporate Governance\n\nContinuing Director Education We also\nencourage our directors to attend outside\ndirector and other continuing education\nprograms and make available to directors\ninformation on director education programs\nthat might be of interest on developments in\nour industry, corporate governance,\nregulatory requirements and expectations, the\neconomic environment, or other matters\nrelevant to their duties as a director of our\nCompany. Director Independence Our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines provide that a\nsignificant majority of the directors on our\nBoard, and all members of the Audit\nCommittee, Governance and Nominating\nCommittee, Human Resources Committee, and\nRisk Committee must be independent under\napplicable independence standards. Each year\nour Board affirmatively determines the\nindependence of each director and each\nnominee for election as a director. Under New\nYork Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules, in order\nfor a director to be considered independent,\nour Board must determine that the director\nhas no material relationship with our Company\n(either directly or as a partner,\nshareholder, or officer of an organization\nthat has a relationship with our Company). To\nassist our Board in making its independence\ndeterminations, our Board adopted the\nDirector Independence Standards appended to\nour Corporate Governance Guidelines. These\nDirector Independence Standards consist of\nthe NYSE\u0092s \u0093bright line\u0094 standards of\nindependence as well as additional standards,\nknown as categorical standards of\nindependence, adopted by our Board. The\nDirector Independence Standards are available\non our website at: https://www.wellsfargo.com\n/about/corporate/governance. Based on the\nDirector Independence Standards, our Board\nconsidered information in early 2021\nregarding banking and financial services,\ncommercial, charitable, familial, and other\nrelationships between each director and\ndirector nominee, his or her respective\nimmediate family members, and/or certain\nentities affiliated with such directors,\ndirector nominees, and immediate family\nmembers, on the one hand, and our Company, on\nthe other, to determine the director\u0092s or\ndirector nominee\u0092s independence. After\nreviewing the information presented to it and\nconsidering the recommendation of the GNC,\nour Board determined that, except for Charles\nW. Scharf, who is a Wells Fargo employee, all\ncurrent directors and director nominees\n(Steven D. Black, Mark A. Chancy, Celeste A.\nClark, Theodore F. Craver, Jr., Wayne M.\nHewett, Donald M. James, Maria R. Morris,\nCharles H. Noski, Richard B. Payne, Jr., Juan\nA. Pujadas, Ronald L. Sargent, and Suzanne M.\nVautrinot) are independent under the Director\nIndependence Standards, including the NYSE\n\u0093bright line\u0094 standards of independence.\nDonald M. James, a current director, is not\nstanding for re-electionand will retire from\nthe Board at our 2021 annual meeting. Our\nBoard determined, therefore, that 11 of our\nBoard\u0092s 12 director nominees are independent.\nThe Board previously determined that John D.\nBaker II was an independent director prior to\nhis retirement from our Board in April 2020\nand each of Elizabeth A. Duke and James H.\nQuigley was an independent director prior to\ntheir resignation from our Board in March\n2020. In connection with making its\nindependence determinations, our Board\nconsidered the following relationships, as\nwell as the relationships with a director\ndescribed under Related Person Transactions\n,under the Director Independence Standards\nand determined that all of these\nrelationships satisfied the NYSE \u0093bright\nline\u0094 standards of independence and were\nimmaterial under our Board\u0092s categorical\nstandards of independence:\n                                              \n                   Our Company\u0092s banking and   \n                   other subsidiaries had     \n                   ordinary course banking    \n                   and financial services     \n                   relationships in 2020      \n                   with certain of our        \n                   directors, some of their   \n                   immediate family members,  \n  Banking and      and/or certain entities    \n  Financial        affiliated with such       \n  Services         directors and their        \n  Relationships    immediate family members,  \n                   all of which were on       \n                   substantially the same     \n                   terms as those             \n                   available at the time for  \n                   comparable transactions    \n                   with persons not           \n                   affiliated with our        \n                   Company and complied with  \n                   applicable banking laws.   \n                   The spouse of a sibling    \n                   of Wayne M.

Risk Is\nPart of Our Business Model The Company\nmeasures and manages risk as part of our\nbusiness, including in connection with the\nproducts and services we offer to our\ncustomers. The risks we take include\nfinancial, such as credit, interest rate,\nmarket, liquidity, and funding risks, and non-\nfinancial,such as operational including\ncompliance and model risks, strategic, and\nreputation risks. Risk Profile Our risk\nprofile is a holistic view of all risks we\nhold at a point in time, including emerging\nrisks. The Company monitors its risk profile,\nand the Board periodically reviews reports and\nanalysis concerning our risk profile. Risk\nAppetite Management defines and the Board\napproves the Company\u0092s risk appetite, which is\nthe amount of risk the Company is comfortable\ntaking given its current level of resources.\nRisk appetite defines which risks are\nacceptable and at what level and guides\nbusiness and risk leaders. Risk appetite\nboundaries are set within the Company\u0092s risk\ncapacity. The Company\u0092s risk appetite is\narticulated in a statement of risk appetite,\nwhich is approved at least annually by the\nBoard. The Company continuously monitors its\nrisk appetite, and the Board reviews periodic\nrisk appetite reports and analysis. Risk and\nStrategy The Company\u0092s risk profile, risk\ncapacity, risk appetite, and risk management\neffectiveness (i.e., the holistic measure of\nthe quality and effectiveness of the Company\u0092s\nrisk management activities, including the\nfunctional or programmatic use of controls and\ncapabilities to manage risks) are considered\nin the strategic planning process, which is\nclosely linked with the Company\u0092s capital\nplanning process. The Company\u0092s Independent\nRisk Management (IRM) organization\nparticipates in strategic planning at several\npoints in the process, providing challenge to\nand independent assessment of the Company\u0092s\nself-assessment of the risks associated with\nstrategic planning initiatives. IRM also\nindependently assesses the impact of the\nstrategic plan on risk capacity, risk\nappetite, and risk management effectiveness at\nthe principal line of business, enterprise\nfunction, and aggregate Company level. After\nreview by management, the strategic plan is\npresented to the Board each year for review\nand approval. Everyone Manages Risk Every\nemployee creates risk in the course of\nperforming business activities and is required\nto manage that risk. Risk is everyone\u0092s\nresponsibility. Every employee is required to\ncomply with applicable laws, regulations, and\nCompany policies. Risk and Culture Senior\nmanagement sets the \u0093tone at the top\u0094 by\nsupporting a strong culture, defined by the\nCompany\u0092s expectations, that guides how\nemployees conduct themselves, work with\ncolleagues, and make decisions.The Board holds\nsenior management accountable for establishing\nand maintaining the right culture and\neffectively managing risk. Employees are\nstrongly encouraged and expected to speak up\nwhen they see something that could cause harm\nto the Company\u0092s customers, communities,\nemployees, shareholders, or reputation.\nBecause risk management is everyone\u0092s\nresponsibility, all employees are expected to\nchallenge risk decisions when appropriate and\nto escalate their concerns when they have not\nbeen addressed. Employee performance\nevaluations are tied to, and take into\naccount, effective risk management. The\nCompany\u0092s performance management and incentive\ncompensation programs are designed to\nestablish a balanced framework for risk and\nreward under core principles that employees\nare expected to know and practice. The Board,\nthrough its Human Resources Committee, plays\nan important role in overseeing and providing\ncredible challenge to the Company\u0092s\nperformance management and incentive\ncompensation programs. See the Performance\nManagement and Incentive Compensationsection\nin this proxy statement for additional\ninformation on the ways in which performance\nevaluations and incentive compensation\ndecisions are tied to, and take into account,\neffective risk management. The Board, through\nits Human Resources Committee, oversees the\nCompany\u0092s performance management and incentive\ncompensation programs. Risk Management\nFramework The Company\u0092s risk management\nframework sets forth the core principles on\nhow the Company seeks to manage and govern its\nrisk. Many Company policies and documents\nanchor to the risk management framework\u0092s core\nprinciples. The Board\u0092s Risk Committee\nannually reviews and approves the risk\nmanagement framework.\n                              \n  2021 Proxy Statement    31  \n                              \nCorporate Governance Wells Fargo\u0092s top\npriority is to strengthen our company by\nbuilding the right risk and control\ninfrastructure. We continue to enhance our\nrisk management programs, including our\noperational and compliance risk management as\nrequired by the Federal Reserve\u0092s February 2,\n2018 and the CFPB/OCC\u0092s April 20, 2018 consent\norders. Risk Governance Role of the Board The\nBoard oversees the Company\u0092s business,\nincluding its risk management. The Board\nassesses management\u0092s performance, provides\ncredible challenge, and holds management\naccountable for maintaining an effective risk\nmanagement program and for adhering to risk\nmanagement expectations. Board Committee\nStructure The Board carries out its risk\noversight responsibilities directly and\nthrough its committees. All of these\ncommittees report to the full Board about\ncommittee activities, including risk oversight\nmatters and are comprised solely of\nindependent directors. Each Board committee\nhas defined authorities and responsibilities\nfor primary oversight of specific risks, as\noutlined in its charter, and works closely\nwith management to understand and oversee our\nCompany\u0092s key risk exposures. For example, the\nRisk Committee approves the Company\u0092s risk\nmanagement framework and oversees its\nimplementation, including the processes\nestablished by management to identify, assess,\nmeasure, monitor, and manage risks. It also\nmonitors the Company\u0092s adherence to its risk\nappetite. In addition, the Risk Committee\noversees IRM and the performance of the Chief\nRisk Officer (CRO) who reports functionally to\nthe Risk Committee and administratively to the\nCEO. Additional information about our risk\nmanagement, as well as the risk oversight\nresponsibilities of the Board and its\ncommittees, including the Risk Committee, is\ndescribed in the Financial Review\u0097Risk\nManagementsection in our Annual Report on Form\n10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2020 and\nunder Our Board and its Committeesin this\nproxy statement. As part of the Board\u0092s and\nits committee\u0092s annual self-evaluation\nprocess, each committee annually reviews its\nrespective charter in light of regulatory\nexpectations, best practices, changes in the\nCompany\u0092s strategy, risk appetite, and\nidentified enterprise risks, updates to our\nrisk management framework, and director and\ncommittee feedback. As a result of its\ncontinuing review of committee\nresponsibilities and oversight of risks, the\nBoard has enhanced the risk oversight\nresponsibilities of various Board committees\nand will continue to review their oversight\nresponsibilities as part of its annual self-\nevaluation process. The Board believes that\nits Board leadership structure with separate\nCEO and independent Chairman roles has the\neffect of enhancing our Board\u0092s risk oversight\nbecause of the independent Chairman\u0092s\ninvolvement in risk oversight matters,\nincluding through the Board agenda planning\nprocess. The Board also believes that Mr.\nScharf\u0092s experience and leadership of the\nCompany\u0092s business, including strategy aligned\nwith risk, significantly contributes to our\nBoard\u0092s understanding and appreciation of risk\nissues. Management Committee Structure The\nCompany has established management committees,\nincluding those focused on risk, that support\nmanagement in carrying out its governance and\nrisk management responsibilities. A management\ngovernance committee is a decision-making body\nthat operates for a particular purpose.\nCertain management governance committees are\noverseen by and/or report to a Board\ncommittee. Each management governance\ncommittee is expected to discuss, document,\nand make decisions regarding significant risk\nissues, emerging risks, and risk acceptances;\nreview and monitor progress related to\ncritical and high-risk issues and remediation\nefforts within its scope, including lessons\nlearned; and report key challenges, decisions,\nescalations, other actions, and open issues as\nappropriate. Management Governance Committees\nReporting to the Risk Committee of the Board\nThe Enterprise Risk & Control Committee (ERCC)\ngoverns the management of all risk types,\nincluding financial risks and non-\nfinancialrisks. The ERCC receives information\nabout risk and control events, addresses\nescalated risks and issues, actively oversees\nrisk control, and provides regular updates to\nthe Risk Committee regarding current and\nemerging risks and management\u0092s assessment of\nthe effectiveness of the Company\u0092s risk\nmanagement program. The ERCC is co-chairedby\nthe CEO and CRO, with membership comprised of\nthe CEOs of our five principal lines of\nbusiness (Consumer and Small Business Banking,\nConsumer Lending, Commercial Banking,\nCorporate and Investment Banking, and Wealth\nand Investment Management) and certain\nenterprise functions. The Chief Auditor or a\ndesignee attends all meetings of the ERCC. The\nERCC has a direct escalation path to the Risk\nCommittee. The ERCC also escalates market\nrisks and issues and interest rate risks and\nissues to the Finance Committee, and certain\nhuman capital risks and issues to the Human\nResources Committee. In addition, the CRO has\nthe authority to escalate risks and issues\ndirectly to\n                               \n  32    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nCorporate Governance\n\nthe Board. Risks and\nissues are escalated\nto the ERCC in\naccordance with\napplicable policies\nand procedures\ngoverning escalations.\nEach principal line of\nbusiness and\nenterprise function\nhas a risk and control\ncommittee, which is a\nmanagement governance\ncommittee with a\nmandate that aligns\nwith the ERCC but with\nits scope limited to\nthe relevant principal\nline of business or\nenterprise function.\nThe focus of these\nrisk and control\ncommittees is on the\nrisks that each\nprincipal line of\nbusiness or enterprise\nfunction generates and\nis responsible for\nmanaging, and the\ncontrols each\nprincipal line of\nbusiness or enterprise\nfunction is expected\nto have in place. In\naddition to each risk\nand control committee,\nmanagement governance\ncommittees dedicated\nto specific risk types\nand risk topics also\nreport to the ERCC to\nhelp provide more\ncomprehensive\ngovernance of risks.\nRisk Operating\nModel\u0097Roles and\nResponsibilities The\nCompany has three\nlines of defense: the\nfront line,\nIndependent Risk\nManagement, and\nInternal Audit.

All of our\ncurrent directors, with the exception of Mark\nA. Chancy who joined our Board after April\n2020, attended our Company\u0092s 2020 annual\nmeeting. Our Board held 21 regular and special\nmeetings, as well as additional update and\ninformational sessions between Board meetings,\nduring 2020. Attendance by our Board\u0092s current\ndirectors at meetings of our Board and its\ncommittees (including subcommittees) averaged\n99% during 2020. Each current director who\nserved as a director during 2020 attended at\nleast 75% of the total number of 2020 meetings\nof our Board and committees on which he or she\nserved. Our Board met in executive session\nwithout management present during 10 of its\n2020 meetings. As described in Strong\nIndependent Board Leadership, the independent\nChairman of our Board chairs executive\nsessions of the non-managementand independent\ndirectors. During 2020, our former independent\nChair, Elizabeth A. Duke, chaired executive\nsessions of the non-managementand independent\ndirectors prior to her resignation from the\nBoard in March 2020. Mr. Noski, our current\nindependent Chairman, now chairs such\nexecutive sessions. Committees of our Board\nand Recent Changes in Committee Structure The\nGNC and the Board conducted a holistic review\nof the Board\u0092s standing committee and\nsubcommittee structure in connection with the\nBoard\u0092s 2020 self-evaluation. Based on its\nreview and effective March 1, 2021, the Board\napproved the reduction of its standing\ncommittees from seven to six by moving credit\nrisk oversight responsibility to the Risk\nCommittee and making the former standing\nCredit Committee a subcommittee of the Risk\nCommittee with the goal of producing more\ndirect oversight of credit risk, as one of the\nCompany\u0092s major risks, by the Risk Committee.\nThe Board\u0092s six standing committees are Audit,\nCorporate Responsibility, Finance, Governance\nand Nominating, Human Resources, and Risk. The\nBoard\u0092s committees act on behalf of the Board\nand report on their activities to the entire\nBoard. In addition, the Risk Committee and the\nBoard approved the recombination of the former\nCompliance Subcommittee into the Risk\nCommittee, with focused compliance program and\nplan updates included as part of Risk\nCommittee meeting agendas. These changes are\nintended to (1) enhance the risk oversight\nresponsibilities of and reporting provided to\nthe Risk Committee, which oversees all\nCompany-wide risks, and (2) avoid duplication\nof oversight responsibilities and reporting.\nIn connection with these committee\nrestructuring and oversight responsibility\nchanges, the Board revised its standing\ncommittee membership effective March 1, 2021.\nThe Board appoints the members and chair of\neach committee based on the recommendation of\nthe GNC. In addition, as part of Board\nsuccession planning and in light of the\nretirement of Donald M. James at the Company\u0092s\nannual meeting, the Board approved changes in\nthe chair of each of the Audit Committee, the\nFinance Committee, and the Governance and\nNominating Committee, effective April 27,\n2021, and will continue to review committee\nmembership as part of its ongoing\nconsideration of Board and committee\ncomposition. The chart below reflects the\ncurrent standing committee and subcommittee\nmembership. Each current member of our\nstanding committees and each member in 2020\nand prior to the effective date of the changes\nwas independent and fulfilled the requirements\napplicable to each committee on which they\nserved. In connection with the GNC\u0092s and the\nBoard\u0092s annual review of committee member\nassignments and chair positions, the GNC\nconsiders best practices with respect to\ncommittee refreshment and committee chair\nrotations. All of the Board\u0092s six standing\ncommittees have new chairs since January 2017.\nThe GNC also reviews a director qualifications\nand experience matrix for each Board committee\nto assist it in evaluating the collective\nexperience of directors on each committee in\nlight of the particular committee\u0092s oversight\nresponsibilities. The collective\nqualifications and experience of directors on\neach committee are reflected in the charts\nunder Board Committee Composition and\nOversight Responsibilitiesbelow. The Board has\nadopted a charter for each standing Board\ncommittee that addresses its purpose,\nauthority, and responsibilities and contains\nother provisions relating to, among other\nmatters, membership and meetings. In its\ndiscretion each committee may form and\ndelegate all or a portion of its authority to\nsubcommittees of one or more of its members.\nAs required by its charter, each committee\nannually reviews and assesses its charter\u0092s\nadequacy and reviews its performance, and also\nis responsible for overseeing reputation risk\nrelated to its responsibilities. Committees\nmay recommend charter amendments at any time,\nand our Board must approve any recommended\ncharter amendments. Additional information\nabout our Board\u0092s six standing committees,\nincluding their key responsibilities, appears\nbelow and a current copy of each committee\u0092s\ncharter is available on our website at: https:\n//www.wellsfargo.com/about/corporate/governanc\ne.\n                               \n  34    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nCorporate Governance\n\nThe following table provides current\nmembership information for each of our\nBoard\u0092s six standing committees and the two\nsubcommittees of the Risk Committee.\n                                              \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                              \u2026        \n      \u2026                                       \n           \u2026         \u2026    \u2026                   \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    &    \u2026    R\u2026    \u2026    T\u2026  \n                     \u2026                        \n                \u00b7                             \n      \u00b7                         \u00b7    \u00b7        \n           \u2026         \u00b7                        \n      \u00b7         \u2026                             \n           \u00b7              \u00b7     \u00b7             \n                \u00b7    \u2026    \u00b7                   \n                          \u00b7    C\u2026          \u00b7  \n      \u2026              \u00b7                        \n                                \u00b7    \u2026        \n                \u00b7               \u00b7    \u00b7     \u00b7  \n      \u00b7              \u00b7    \u2026                   \n           \u00b7                    \u00b7         C\u2026  \n      4    3    4    4    4     6    3     3  \n                                              \n\u00b7= Member\n                                              \n         Effective March 1, 2021, the Board   \n         moved primary oversight              \n         responsibility for credit risk to    \n         the Risk Committee and made its      \n         former standing Credit Committee a   \n         subcommittee of the Risk Committee   \n         with the goal of                     \n         producing more direct oversight of   \n         credit risk, as one of the Company\u0092s  \n  (1)    major risks, by the Risk Committee.  \n         The Risk Committee had previously    \n         formed a Technology Subcommittee     \n         which began meeting in January       \n         2018.

Equity\nCompensation For 2020, each non-\nemployeedirector elected to our Board at our\nCompany\u0092s annual meeting of shareholders\nreceived on that date an award of Company\ncommon stock having a value of $180,000. Each\nnon-employeedirector who joins our Board as\nof any other date receives, as of such other\ndate, an award of Company common stock having\na value of $180,000 prorated to reflect the\nnumber of months (rounded up to the next\nwhole month) until the next annual meeting of\nshareholders. The dollar value of each stock\naward is converted to a number of shares of\nCompany common stock using the closing price\non the grant date, rounded up to the nearest\nwhole share. Deferral Program A non-\nemployeedirector of our Company or WFBNA may\ndefer all or part of his or her cash\ncompensation and stock awards. Cash\ncompensation may be deferred into either an\ninterest-bearing account or common stock\nunits with dividends reinvested. The interest\nrate paid in 2020 on interest-bearing\naccounts was 2.14%. Stock awards may be\ndeferred only into common stock units with\ndividends reinvested. Deferred amounts are\npaid either in a lump sum or installments as\nelected by the director. Stock Ownership\nPolicy Our Board has adopted a director stock\nownership policy that each non-\nemployeedirector, within five years after\njoining our Board, own shares of our common\nstock having a value equal to five times the\nannual cash retainer, and maintain at least\nthat ownership level while a member of our\nBoard and for one year after service as a\ndirector ends. Each director who has been on\nour Board for five years or more exceeded\nthis ownership level as of December 31, 2020,\nand each director who has served less than\nfive years is on track to meet this ownership\nlevel. GNC Use of Compensation Consultant The\nGNC is authorized to retain and obtain advice\nof legal, accounting, or other advisors at\nour expense without prior permission of\nmanagement or our Board. The GNC retained FW\nCook, a nationally recognized compensation\nconsulting firm, to provide independent\nadvice on non-employeedirector compensation\nmatters for 2020. FW Cook compiles\ncompensation data for the financial services\ncompanies the GNC considers our Labor Market\nPeer Group (which is the same peer group used\nto evaluate our Company\u0092s executive\ncompensation program) from time to time, and\nreviews with the GNC our Company\u0092s non-\nemployeedirector compensation program\ngenerally and in comparison to those of our\nLabor Market Peer Group. FW Cook also advises\nthe GNC on the reasonableness of our non-\nemployeedirector compensation levels compared\nto our Labor Market Peer Group.\n                               \n  42    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nInformation About Related Persons Related\nPerson Transactions Lending and Other Ordinary\nCourse Financial Services Transactions During\n2020, some of our executive officers,\ndirectors (including certain of our HRC\nmembers) and director nominees, each of the\npersons we know of that beneficially owned\nmore than 5% of our common stock on December\n31, 2020 (BlackRock, Inc. and The Vanguard\nGroup), and persons we know of that\nbeneficially owned more than 5% of our common\nstock during 2020 (Warren E.

All of\nthese lending, banking, and financial services\ntransactions were on substantially the same\nterms, including interest rates, collateral,\nand repayment (as applicable), as those\navailable at the time for comparable\ntransactions with persons not related to our\nCompany, and did not involve more than the\nnormal risk of collectability or present other\nunfavorable features. In the ordinary course\nof business, we also sell or purchase other\nproducts and services, including the purchase\nof insurance products and aviation services,\nfrom Berkshire Hathaway and its affiliates and\nthe purchase of investment management\ntechnology products and advisory services from\nBlackRock and its affiliates. We and our\ncustomers also may invest in mutual funds,\nexchange traded funds, and other products\naffiliated with BlackRock and Vanguard, and we\nand such firms may receive fees in connection\nwith those investments, in the ordinary course\nof business. All of these transactions were\nentered into on an arms\u0092 length basis and\nunder customary terms and conditions.\nRelocation Loan In 2011 and prior to his\nbecoming an executive officer during 2019,\nWells Fargo made a loan to Derek A.

Since 2015, Wells Fargo also has\nemployed a relative of Mr. Black who is not an\n\u0093immediate family member\u0094 for purposes of the\nSEC\u0092s related person transaction rules. We\nestablished the compensation paid to each of\nthese employees in 2020 in accordance with our\nemployment and compensation practices\napplicable to employees with equivalent\nqualifications and responsibilities and\nholding similar positions. In addition to this\ncompensation, each of these employees also\nreceived employee benefits generally available\nto all of our employees.

expectation from senior\nleaders of the Company. They play an important\nrole in reshaping the company, guide how we\nconduct ourselves, work with our colleagues,\nand make decisions. The expectations are clear\nand straightforward, and they hold everyone\naccountable for doing what\u0092s right and doing\nit well. We Are Committed to Acting With\nEthics and Integrity We are committed to doing\nwhat is right, acting with integrity, and\nholding ourselves accountable. Our Code of\nEthics and Business Conduct At Wells Fargo, we\nexpect all employees to Do What\u0092s Right by\ncustomers, stakeholders, and each other. Our\nCode of Ethics and Business Conduct provides\nadditional clarity and focus on the ethical\nbehavior we expect of all employees and\nmembers of our Board. The Code is supported by\nunderlying policies as well as by interactive\nonline training that all employees complete\nannually. Members of the Board also\nacknowledge annually that they have read and\nunderstand their obligations under the Code of\nEthics and Business Conduct. It is critical\nfor employees to understand our expectations\nand always do what is right. Employees also\nneed to be comfortable speaking up with no\nfear of retaliation if they have a concern or\nsee something that does not seem quite right.\nOur Speak Up and Non-RetaliationPolicy Wells\nFargo does not tolerate retaliation of any\nkind. Our employees\u0092 dedication and integrity\nare key to building a Wells Fargo we can all\nbe proud of, and our leadership believes that\nit is critical everyone feels safe raising\nconcerns and cooperating with investigations\nwithout fear of retaliation or other negative\nactions, such as harassment or\nunprofessionalism. By speaking up when they\nhave a concern, our employees offer a\ncourageous and vital contribution to Wells\nFargo\u0092s ethical working environment. Every\nemployee\u0092s voice matters, regardless of\nhis/her/their role, position in the Company,\nor location. Our Speak Up and Non-\nRetaliationPolicy requires all employees to\nadhere to the Code of Ethics and Business\nConduct and supporting policies, recognize\nunethical behavior, and report suspected\nunethical or illegal conduct. The policy also\nsets additional expectations for managers to\nguard against retaliatory conduct, watch for\nsigns of retaliation, and report any conduct\nthat may violate policies. To report a\nconcern, employees may talk to a manager,\ncontact Employee Relations, or contact our\nconfidential EthicsLine. We Are Listening to\nOur Employees Employee feedback has been\nessential in helping enhance our culture and\nimprove the employee experience. Employees\nhave shared their voices in a number of ways,\nincluding surveys, town halls, and two-\nwaydialogue on our intranet and internal\nsocial media platforms. Loudspeaker Wells\nFargo has begun implementing a new digital\nsuggestion box designed for employees to\nprovide feedback. First announced by CEO\nCharlie Scharf in July 2020, the new employee\nfeedback channel is called Loudspeaker.\nLoudspeaker\u0092s goal is to improve our customer\nexperience, our employee experience, and to\nuncover opportunities to grow revenue, reduce\nexpenses, be more efficient, and help make\nWells Fargo better. Loudspeaker will capture\nemployees\u0092 feedback to help Wells Fargo\nexecute more nimbly, strengthen high-\nperforming teams, and foster a culture of\ncandor\u0097all part of the six new expectations\nfor work at Wells Fargo.

We play a significant role in\nboth supporting diverse communities across\nthe nation and helping foster even deeper\ncommitments to a more inclusive society.\nWells Fargo has long believed that focusing\non the needs of all of our stakeholders,\nincluding customers, employees, regulators,\nsuppliers, communities, and shareholders,\ndrives long-term value creation. One of\nCharlie Scharf\u0092s first actions as our new CEO\nwas to sign the Business Roundtable\u0092s\nStatement on the Purpose of a Corporation\n(BRT Statement), which is a clear statement\nthat businesses are responsible to a broad\nset of constituents. Many of the tenets of\nthe BRT Statement reflect the inclusive\nenvironment we continue to create at Wells\nFargo. In particular, the statement calls for\nan economy that allows each person to succeed\nthrough hard work and creativity and to lead\na life of meaning and dignity. It stresses\nthe importance of fostering diversity and\ninclusion, dignity, and respect among our\nemployees and supporting and respecting the\ncommunities in which we work. See pages\n121-122 of this proxy statement for more\ninformation on our support of diverse\ncommunities and an inclusive recovery.\n                               \n  56    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nHuman Capital Management\n\nOur Diverse Candidate Sourcing and Interview\nGuidelines Consistent with our commitment to\nadvance diversity, equity, and inclusion\n(DE&I) and improve workforce diversity, Wells\nFargo has established Diversity Sourcing and\nInterview Team Guidelines that require\ndiverse candidate slates and interview teams\n(referred to as our Diverse Search\nRequirement). Our Diverse Search Requirement\nwas originally implemented based on our\nevaluation of the Company\u0092s workforce in\norder to determine how best to improve\nworkforce diversity. Based on our ongoing\nreview, the Company decided to expand the\nscope of the Diverse Search Requirement in\n2020 as part of our overall and continuing\nefforts to enhance workforce diversity. We\ndefine diversity for these purposes to\ninclude the following diversity dimensions:\nrace/ethnicity, gender, LGBTQ, veterans, and\npeople with disabilities. The Diverse Search\nRequirement requires the following for most\nU.S. roles with total direct compensation\ngreater than $100,000:\n                                              \n      At least 50% of interview candidates    \n      must be diverse with respect to at      \n      least one diversity dimension; and      \n                                              \n                                              \n      At least one interviewer on the hiring  \n      panel must represent at least one       \n      diversity dimension.                    \n                                              \nBased on our evaluation of our workforce\ncomposition, the Company determined that\nroles with total direct compensation above\n$100,000 presented the greatest opportunity\nfor improving diverse representation at the\nCompany. For roles with total direct\ncompensation less than $100,000, we have\nobserved a historically higher level of\ndiversity. As of December 31, 2020, the scope\nof the Diverse Search Requirement would have\ncovered:\n                                              \n      Approximately 95% of all U.S. roles     \n      with total direct compensation greater  \n      than $100,000; and                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      Approximately 48% of all active U.S.    \n      employees irrespective of their total   \n      direct compensation.                    \n                                              \nThese roles include\nsenior management\nroles reporting to our\nCEO as well as job\npostings for covered\nU.S. roles, regardless\nof whether the\ncandidates are\ninternal or external,\nbut would not include\npromotions through our\nperformance management\nprocess. In addition,\nthrough our talent\nreview and succession\nplanning processes we\nidentify emerging and\ntop talent and support\nappropriate\ndevelopment planning\nefforts. We are\nfocused on preparing\ndiverse leaders for\nsuccess through\nleadership development\nopportunities,\ntraining, mentoring,\nand talent development\nplans. Beginning in\n2021, our talent\nreview process for\nsenior management\nroles will include\ndiverse talent reviews\nfor business and\nenterprise function\ngroups across the\nCompany. Any\nexceptions to the\nDiverse Search\nRequirement must be\napproved by an\nOperating Committee\nmember or one of their\ndirect reports (or\ntheir assigned\ndelegate). In order to\nobtain approval for an\nexception, hiring\nmanagers must show\nthat sufficient\noutreach efforts were\nmade (including the\nuse of a variety of\nsourcing activities to\nidentify diverse\ncandidates) and that\ndespite those efforts,\nthey were unable to\nmeet the Diverse\nSearch Requirement. As\ndiscussed under Human\nCapital Management,\nWells Fargo also has\nin place numerous\nother programs and\ninitiatives designed\nto improve workforce\ndiversity, including\nexpanding the reach of\nour of early talent\nprogram recruiting by\nincreasing our\nrecruitment efforts at\nHispanic-serving\ninstitutions and\nhistorically black\ncolleges and\nuniversities.\n\nAccountability for\nAdvancing Diversity,\nEquity, and Inclusion\nOur CEO and the\nOperating Committee\nlead the advancement\nof DE&I efforts across\nthe Company.

Our         \n  Performance Management Policy               \n  establishes the framework and standards     \n  that reinforce personal accountability and  \n  risk management, and provides an            \n  opportunity for personal recognition and    \n  development. Managers and employees work    \n  together to set performance objectives in   \n  support                                     \n  of enterprise strategy, business goals and  \n  their roles and responsibilities through    \n  the lens of strong risk management          \n  practices. Managers and employees engage    \n  in ongoing coaching and feedback            \n  activities throughout the year and          \n  participate in mid-year and year-end        \n  performance evaluations where they          \n  document and discuss accomplishments        \n  against their objectives, as well as areas  \n  of focus and development                    \n  opportunities. Performance improvement      \n  opportunities are also addressed, as        \n  needed, to proactively remediate            \n  performance issues as they arise.           \n  Our compensation program is linked to       \n  performance management and promotes         \n  prudent risk accountability and reinforces  \n  our Company expectations. The Company\u0092s      \n  compensation principles are:                \n                                              \n                                              \n      Pay for performance. Compensation is    \n      linked to Company, line of business,    \n      and individual performance, including   \n      meeting regulatory expectations and     \n      creating long-term value consistent     \n      with the interests of shareholders.     \n                                              \n                                              \n      Effective risk management.              \n      Compensation promotes risk management   \n      and discourages imprudent or excessive  \n      risk-taking.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      Attract and retain talent. People are   \n      one of the Company\u0092s competitive         \n      advantages; therefore, compensation     \n      helps                                   \n      attract, motivate, and retain people    \n      with the skills, talent, and            \n      experience to drive superior long-term  \n      Company performance.                    \n                                              \nThrough our Incentive Compensation Risk\nManagement (ICRM) Policy and program, we\ndevelop, execute and administer all incentive\ncompensation plans that balance risk and\nfinancial reward in a manner that supports\nour customers, shareholders, employees, and\nCompany. The ICRM program accounts for Wells\nFargo\u0092s Risk Management Framework, including\nall of the Company\u0092s financial and non-\nfinancial risks, and regulatory requirements.\nOur Board oversees our performance management\nand compensation programs through its Human\nResources Committee (HRC). The HRC oversees\nand challenges the Company\u0092s performance\nmanagement and incentive compensation\nprograms to drive accountability and promote\nthe right behaviors, including expectations\nfor risk management. The HRC is supported by\nmanagement\u0092s Incentive Compensation and\nPerformance Management Committee. New for\n2020, each Business Group and Enterprise\nFunction has implemented a steering committee\nto further enhance the Company\u0092s oversight\nand risk mitigation efforts across\ncompensation and performance management. Each\nsteering committee\u0092s responsibilities include\nassessing accountability for risk failures\nwithin their business or group and making\nappropriate recommendations as a result of\nthose failures. Board-Level Oversight and\nManagement Committee Governance of Incentive\nCompensation and Performance Management Board\nof Directors and Human Resources Committee\nThe Board plays an important role in\noverseeing the Company\u0092s performance\nmanagement and incentive compensation\nprograms. The Board expanded the oversight\nresponsibilities of the HRC in 2017 to\ninclude human capital management, culture,\nand ethics. Consolidating those oversight\nresponsibilities under the HRC allows it to\nfocus on the alignment of the Company\u0092s\nculture and employee conduct with our\nperformance management and incentive\ncompensation programs. The HRC has overseen\nsubstantial changes to promote risk\naccountability such as the addition of risk\naccountability as a core component of\nemployee performance objectives, Company\nexpectations for employees and managers,\nenhancements to strengthen the consideration\nof risk in performance evaluations, and the\nimplementation of a framework and standards\nfor including misconduct as an input to\nperformance evaluations and incentive\ndecisions.\n                               \n  58    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nHuman Capital Management\n\nIncentive Compensation and Performance\nManagement Committee The Human Resources\nCommittee also has overseen management\u0092s\nestablishment and enhancement of management-\nlevel governance for performance management\nand incentive compensation.

For the ICRM\nprogram, the Incentive Compensation and\nPerformance Management Committee has\nresponsibility for overseeing the effective\ndesign and risk-balancing of broad-based\nincentive compensation arrangements. Group\nIncentive Compensation and Performance\nManagement Steering Committees Group\nIncentive Compensation and Performance\nManagement Steering Committees (Group IPCs)\nare steering committees established by the\nIncentive Compensation and Performance\nManagement Committee to oversee, govern, and\nmake informed recommendations or decisions,\nas applicable, about business-aligned efforts\nrelated to incentive compensation and\nperformance management, with a critical focus\non material risk failures, for applicable\nemployees and practices within its authority\nand in accordance with our Risk Management\nFramework. Remuneration Committees The\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)\nRemuneration Committee and the established\nentity-level remuneration committees (for\nexample, Wells Fargo Bank N.A. London Branch\nand Wells Fargo Securities International\nLimited remuneration committees) provide\nlocal remuneration governance focused on\neffectively applying the applicable\nremuneration policy and remuneration\npractices, as well as approving the\nidentified staff approach and resulting list\nof identified staff employees. Performance\nManagement Each year, employees are expected\nto have defined performance objectives so\nthat they focus time and resources\nappropriately and know how their performance\nwill be assessed. On an annual basis,\nmanagers complete a mid-year and year-end\nperformance evaluation with their employees\nwhere they document key accomplishments\nagainst objectives, including risk\naccountability. Each employee is provided\nwith both an overall performance rating and a\nrisk overlay rating.

The Misconduct Accountability\nProgram requires that there be performance\nmanagement and incentive compensation impacts\nfor each employee who has engaged in certain\ntypes of misconduct and that the employee\u0092s\nmanager document corrective actions in the\nemployee\u0092s performance evaluation. Covered\nEmployees As indicated above, every employee\nis assessed for risk accountability, and\ntheir manager identifies any significant risk\nmanagement issues or failures. In addition,\nan enhanced risk assessment process has been\nimplemented for leaders designated as\n\u0093Covered Employees in Management,\u0094 which\ninclude the CEO and members of the Operating\nCommittee, and individual leaders who run the\nCompany\u0092s major lines of business, and\ncertain other senior leaders whose\nresponsibilities and actions may expose the\nCompany to material risk or who have roles\nthat are subject to specific regulatory\nrequirements. CEO and Operating Committee\nMembers For the CEO, the performance\nevaluation against all of his objectives,\nincluding risk management, is conducted by\nthe HRC. For members of the Operating\nCommittee (except the Chief Risk Officer and\nChief Auditor), the CEO\u0092s evaluation of their\nperformance includes a risk review conducted\nby the Chief Risk Officer, with input from\nleaders within Independent Risk Management\nand Internal Audit. For the Chief Risk\nOfficer and Chief Auditor, the risk review is\nconducted by the chairs of the Risk Committee\nand Audit Committee, respectively. The Human\nResources Committee oversees and approves the\nannual incentives for the CEO and Operating\nCommittee based upon their performance\nevaluations, including risk management.\nAdditional Covered Employees in Management\nFor the additional Covered Employees in\nManagement, a risk assessment is completed by\nIndependent Risk Management and Internal\nAudit and shared with the managers of the\nemployees to inform year-end performance\nrating and pay recommendations. Among the\nrisk and audit factors considered are risk\nleadership and collaboration; risk\naccountability metrics; regulatory\nremediation; issue management; audit input;\nand risk failures and events. The manager\u0092s\nrisk assessment, along with the Independent\nRisk Management and Audit assessments, are\nthen reviewed and challenged at both the\nbusiness group and enterprise levels by the\nrelevant Incentive Compensation and\nPerformance Management committees. The CEO\nalso reviews and challenges the ratings and\ncompensation recommendations.\n                               \n  60    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nHuman Capital Management\n\nHuman Resources Committee Oversight As part\nof the performance evaluation process, the\nHRC reviews and considers the input from the\nbusiness group and Incentive Compensation and\nPerformance Management Committees and\ndiscusses perspectives from the CEO, Chief\nRisk Officer, and head of Human Resources.\nThe risk outcomes are critical inputs into\nthe HRC\u0092s compensation decisions for the\nOperating Committee and those additional\nCovered Employees in Management who have\nresponsibility for a significant line of\nbusiness or responsibility for critical\nenterprise-wide functional activities, and\nmay result in compensation adjustments,\nincluding the elimination or reduction of an\nannual or outstanding long-term award.\nAdditionally, the HRC has oversight of the\nrisk evaluation process and any related\ncompensation impacts for all Covered\nEmployees in Management, including approval\nof the vesting of prior-year long-term\nincentive awards that have risk-balancing\nfeatures, such as forfeiture provisions, that\nallow the HRC to reduce or forfeit\noutstanding awards based on risk management\nfailures. Total Compensation Total\ncompensation for Covered Employees in\nManagement includes (1) a base salary that is\npaid in cash in an amount subject to annual\nreview and adjustment based on changes to\nresponsibilities or competitive market\nconditions and (2) a total incentive\ncompensation award that is variable and paid\nin a combination of cash and long-term\nincentives subject to vesting over time. The\nentire incentive award is determined based on\nthe performance evaluation, including risk\naccountability, as described above. Factors\nconsidered in determining variable total\nincentive awards Long-term incentives have\nstrong risk-balancing components, with\nfeatures that foster sound risk management\nand accountability, including:\n                                              \n      Long-Term, Performance-Based, and       \n      At-Risk Compensation. A large           \n      proportion of                           \n      compensation is in the form of equity   \n      that subject to time and/or             \n      performance vesting. Long-term equity   \n      remains at risk until payment, which    \n      allows the HRC to assess risk outcomes  \n      as they emerge over time.               \n                                              \n                                              \n      Long-Term Compensation Risk-Balancing   \n      Features. All long-term awards are      \n      denominated in share equivalents based  \n      on                                      \n      the dollar value of the award and the   \n      Company\u0092s stock price at the time of     \n      grant, thus the ultimate value upon     \n      vesting will reflect shareholder        \n      returns through the date of             \n      distribution. Performance Share awards  \n      require achievement of financial        \n      performance targets and may be reduced  \n      if the Company incurs a net operating   \n      loss for any year in the performance    \n      period. Equity compensation does not    \n      accelerate upon retirement. Equity      \n      compensation is subject to forfeiture   \n      or clawback under certain               \n      conditions, which allow the HRC to      \n      consider risk outcomes over time. The   \n      Company\u0092s stock ownership policy         \n      applies to the CEO and each other       \n      executive officer or member of its      \n      Operating Committee for one year after  \n      retirement.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      Clawbacks and Forfeiture. The HRC has   \n      the discretion to cancel all or any     \n      portion of an outstanding award, and    \n      recover paid compensation from certain  \n      members of senior management, under     \n      certain conditions, as discussed in     \n      more detail under Clawback and          \n      Forfeiture Policy in the Compensation   \n      Discussion and Analysis in this proxy   \n      statement.                              \n                                              \n                              \n  2021 Proxy Statement    61  \n                              \nHuman Capital Management\n\nIncentive Compensation Risk Management The\nCompany develops, executes, governs, and\nmaintains incentive compensation plans that\nare designed to balance risk and financial\nreward through its ICRM Policy and program.\nThis program covers all incentive eligible\nemployees so that incentive compensation\narrangements are developed and managed to\nalign with the Company\u0092s strategic plan and\nRisk Management Framework, and with\napplicable statutes and regulations. As\noutlined in our ICRM policy and applicable\nstandards, our governance framework\nidentifies material risk-takers, is designed\nto account for their incentive compensation\nto be appropriately balanced to discourage\nunnecessary or inappropriate risk-taking, and\nprovides for monitoring and validation. The\ntable below summarizes the key stakeholders\nwho develop and implement our ICRM program.\nIncentive Compensation Design The ICRM Policy\nand program covers all employees who are\neligible to participate in an incentive\ncompensation arrangement. To effectively and\nthoroughly govern all incentive compensation\narrangements in a consistent manner, the\nCompany has incentive compensation design\nstandards applicable to all incentive\ncompensation arrangements. Risk management is\nconsidered in the design of all incentive\ncompensation arrangements. Human Resources\ncoordinates the annual review process in\npartnership with Independent Risk Management\nand other centralized control functions, and\ndesigns and manages the ICRM program,\nincluding the ICRM Policy. During the review,\nwe assess risk balancing, compliance with\nlaws and regulations, and the arrangements\u0092\npotential to encourage employees to take\nunnecessary or inappropriate risks. The ICRM\nPolicy and program also define incentive plan\ndesign standards that, as applicable based on\nthe type of incentive plan, accounts for\nadditional oversight and review. The design\nprocess includes:\n                                              \n      Analysis and rationale.

Wells Fargo\nranked No. 30 on Fortune\u0092s2020 rankings of\nAmerica\u0092s largest corporations. We ranked\nfourth in both assets and in the market value\nof our common stock among all U.S. banks at\nDecember 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, we\nhad an active employee headcount of 268,531,\nwith approximately 88% of employees based in\nthe United States. Our global workforce was\n54% female and 46% male, and our U.S.\nworkforce was 56% female and 44% male. Our\nU.S. workforce was 55% Caucasian/white and\n45% racially/ethnically diverse. Supporting\nEmployees During the COVID-19Pandemic In\nresponse to the COVID-19pandemic, we expanded\nwork-from-home capabilities wherever\npossible, and enabled approximately 200,000\nemployees to work from home. For jobs that\ncould not be done remotely, we took\nsignificant actions to enhance safety,\nincluding implementing social distancing\nmeasures, requiring employees to wear facial\ncoverings, staggering staff and shifts, and\nenhancing cleaning protocols in accordance\nwith guidance from the U.S. Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention. We adjusted\nour child care benefits in the U.S. and\nCanada to provide additional resources and\nflexibility for employees impacted by school\nclosures. We also enhanced our health care\nand time-offbenefits in the U.S. to help\nfully cover the medical costs associated with\nCOVID-19and allow high-risk, exposed, or\ninfected employees to stay home without\nhaving to take paid time off. At more than 50\nof our largest U.S. sites, we launched a\ntemporary on-sitenursing service to screen\nfor COVID-19symptoms and refer individuals\nfor testing. We also took a number of actions\nto support our employees\u0092 financial security.\nWe made additional cash payments to employees\nwhose roles required them to go into the\noffice to serve customers or other employees.\nFor U.S. nonexempt employees, we temporarily\ndoubled the hourly rate for time worked over\n40 hours per week. We also made a $25 million\ngrant to the WE Care employee relief fund,\nwhich provided financial assistance to more\nthan 23,000 U.S. and international employees\nfacing COVID-related hardships. Pay Equity\nReview\n                                              \n  Wells Fargo is committed to fair and        \n  equitable compensation practices, and we    \n  regularly review our compensation programs  \n  and practices for pay equity.               \n  Each year, we engage a third-party          \n  consultant to conduct a thorough pay        \n  equity review of employee compensation,     \n  which considers gender, race, and           \n  ethnicity. The results of our 2020 review,  \n  after accounting for factors such as role,  \n  tenure, and                                 \n  geography, show that women at Wells Fargo   \n  continued to earn more than 99 cents for    \n  every $1 earned by their male peers. In     \n  addition, our U.S. employees who are        \n  racially/ethnically diverse continued to    \n  earn more than 99 cents for every $1        \n  earned by                                   \n  Caucasian/white peers. These results have   \n  remained consistent since we started        \n  publishing the results of our pay equity    \n  review in 2017.                             \n  Compensation and Benefits                   \n  We value and support our people as a        \n  competitive advantage.

The HRC\nviews executive compensation as instrumental\nin our ability to drive shareholder value\nthrough plans and programs that reinforce\nshared success, serve to attract the talent\nneeded to effectively develop and execute on\nour strategic priorities, align the interests\nof executives with those of shareholders over\nthe short-, medium-, and long-term, and\ndiscourage imprudent risk-taking and hold\nindividuals accountable, as appropriate. 2020\nEnhancements to Our Compensation Program To\nfoster and reinforce alignment between the\ninterests of named executives and those of\nshareholders, the HRC made a number of\nenhancements to our executive compensation\nprogram in 2020, specifically:\n                                              \n                         For PSAs granted     \n                         for 2020             \n                         performance,         \n                         continued to use     \n                         ROTCE as the         \n                         performance metric.  \n                         Reflecting the       \n                         ongoing              \n                         transformation of    \n                         the Company, which   \n                         positions the        \n                         Company              \n                         differently from     \n                         its peers, the       \n                         ROTCE metric will    \n                         be based on          \n                         absolute             \n                         performance.

In terms of the\nsignificant drivers, provision for credit\nlosses increased $11.4 billion with large\nreserve builds in the first half of 2020\nreflecting forecasted credit deterioration\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic. Low interest\nrates negatively impacted our net interest\nincome, and we were limited in our ability to\noffset this given our constraint of operating\nunder an asset cap as part of our consent\norder with the Federal Reserve. We recognized\nrestructuring charges to accelerate our\nefficiency initiatives, and we continued to\nspend significant amounts to build out our\nrisk and control infrastructure as well as to\nprovide remediation to customers to address\nour historical shortcomings. The pandemic\nincreased our expenses and reduced revenue as\nwe took actions to protect the safety of both\nour employees and customers while continuing\nto carry out the Company\u0092s role as a provider\nof essential services to our communities.\nDespite the challenging environment, the\nstrength of our balance sheet was evident\nthroughout the year. Although we reduced our\ndividend, we continued to maintain capital\nlevels well above regulatory minimums, and\nthe results of the two Federal Reserve stress\ntests confirmed our strong capital position.\nThe Company also announced expanded\ncommitments to diversity, equity and\ninclusion.

Both\nthe annual cash bonus and the long-term\nequity components of incentive compensation\nawarded are determined based on the prior\nyear\u0092s performance. Long-term equity remains\nat risk until payment, which allows the HRC\nto assess risk outcomes as they emerge over\ntime. Additionally, we have an accountability\nframework that, under defined conditions,\nenables the forfeiture or recovery of\ncompensation in the event named executives\u0092\nactions, or inactions, result in specified\ntypes of negative outcomes for our Company.\n                              \n  2021 Proxy Statement    71  \n                              \nExecutive Compensation Performance Assessment\nThe cornerstone of our compensation program is\nthe performance assessment, which is guided by\nour robust performance assessment framework,\nsupported by a processoverseen by our HRC, and\ndirectly drives the outcomeof incentive\ncompensation awarded. Performance Assessment\nProcess The HRC directly oversees the\nperformance management of our named executives\nand approves their compensation after\nconsidering overall performance against their\nannual objectives. The HRC reviews and\napproves the annual financial and non-\nfinancialperformance objectives set by the\nCEO. These objectives are aligned with the\nCompany\u0092s strategic plan, risk appetite, and\nrisk and control framework. The objectives\nthen flow through to each named executive, who\nestablishes aligned goals that are reviewed by\nthe HRC. For the Company performancecomponent,\nthe HRC evaluates Company results after the\nend of the performance year, taking into\naccount financial outcomes, consistency with\nthe strategic plan and our risk appetite,\nprior year performance, and execution of key\ninitiatives and other qualitative factors,\nwhich for 2020 included our response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. The CEO and HRC assess\nCompany performance as a starting point for\ndetermining compensation for named executives.\nAdditional details on the Company performance\ndetermination for 2020 are discussed under 1.\nCompany Performance. For the individual\nperformanceand risk accountability(risk\noverlay) components, at the end of a\nperformance period, the CEO evaluates the\nperformance of Operating Committee members,\nincluding named executives, against their\nobjectives. For each Operating Committee\nmember other than the Chief Risk Officer and\nChief Auditor, the CEO\u0092s evaluation includes a\nrisk review conducted by the Chief Risk\nOfficer with input from leaders within\nIndependent Risk Management and Internal\nAudit. For the Chief Risk Officer and Chief\nAuditor, the risk review is conducted by the\nchairs of the Risk Committee and Audit\nCommittee, respectively. The performance\nevaluation of each Operating Committee member\nincludes performance related to risk\naccountability, group financial performance,\nand overall management effectiveness. For Mr.\nScharf, a formal performance assessment\nframework, including quantitative and\nqualitative objectives, was used to assess his\nperformance and determine his compensation for\nthe 2020 performance year. The HRC has\nhistorically established threshold goals as a\nfactor to be evaluated along with other\nfinancial and non-financial performance\nconsiderations for the funding and payment of\ncash bonuses under the Wells Fargo Bonus Plan\n(Bonus Plan), the Company\u0092s annual incentive\nplan that covers a broad population of\nemployees (including for 2020 our named\nexecutives). Consistent with this historical\npractice and before the COVID-19 pandemic\nbecame widespread in the United States, the\nHRC established threshold goals for 2020 of\n(1) EPS of at least $3.00, or (2) ROTCE of at\nleast the median of the Financial Performance\nPeer Group. As a result of the effects of the\npandemic on the Company\u0092s performance for\n2020, the HRC determined that application of\nthese threshold goals, which were not met, was\nnot appropriate or in the best interests of\nthe Company. In making this determination and\nspecifically authorizing payment of 2020 cash\nbonuses under the Bonus Plan, the HRC\nconsidered, among other factors: the\nsignificant impact of the pandemic on global\neconomic and market conditions; the actions\ntaken by the Company in response to the\npandemic to support customers, employees and\ncommunities; the Company\u0092s strong capital and\nliquidity maintained throughout the year; and\nthe Company\u0092s demonstrable progress addressing\nrisk, control and regulatory issues, with\nrecognition of significant work remaining.

The HRC used progress on\ndiversity as a potential modifier of variable\ncompensation, with failure to meet\nexpectations resulting in a reduction,\nmeeting expectations having no impact, and\nexceeding expectations resulting in an\nincrease. Compensation Determination\nFramework The determination of actual annual\nincentive compensation for 2020 was\ndetermined by the HRC based on a holistic\nassessment of Company performance, individual\nperformance, and risk accountability. Each\nnamed executive has a base salary and total\nincentive compensation target (comprised of\nannual cash bonus and long-term equity\ntargets), which are established by the HRC\nafter careful consideration of market data\nfrom our Labor Market Peer Group, the value\nand importance of the role to the\norganization, internal pay equity, and input\nfrom the HRC\u0092s independent compensation\nconsultant. Based on the factors set forth\nabove, including overall performance\nassessment, the HRC determined each named\nexecutive\u0092s total incentive compensation for\n2020. The annual cash bonus and long-term\nequity compensation amounts were determined\nby multiplying the percentage of target total\nincentive awarded, by annual cash bonus and\nlong-term equity targets, respectively.\nConsistent with the compensation principles\nof paying for performance and promoting\neffective risk management, the HRC weights\ntarget incentive compensation opportunities \u0096\nand thus incentive compensation awards \u0096 more\nheavily toward compensation that vests over\ntime, pays out based on performance that\ncreates long-term value, and is subject to\nforfeiture or recovery (as appropriate). See\n4. Pay Practicesfor further detail. Messrs.\nSantomassimo and Owens joined the Company in\nthe second half of the year (on October 16,\n2020 and July 22, 2020, respectively) and had\nannual incentive opportunities with a minimum\namount provided for their first year only,\nunder the terms of their offer letters. Pay\ndeterminations and summaries of the HRC\u0092s\ndetermination of Company performance,\nindividual performance, and risk\naccountability for each named executive are\nprovided in 3.

During the year, FW Cook\ncompiled compensation data for the Labor\nMarket Peer Group and reviewed with the HRC\nour executive compensation programs generally\nand compared to those of our Labor Market\nPeer Group. FW Cook also advised the HRC on\nthe reasonableness of our compensation levels\ncompared to our Labor Market Peer Group and\nthe appropriateness of our compensation\nprogram structure in supporting our business\nobjectives. The HRC annually reviews the\nservices performed by, and the fees paid to\nFW Cook, and FW Cook does no other work for\nour Company or management other than to\nprovide consulting services to the GNC, HRC,\nand Board that are directly related to\nemployee and non-employeedirector\ncompensation. To help maintain the\nindependence of any consultant retained by\nthe HRC, the HRC is required under its\ncharter to pre-approveall services performed\nfor our Company by FW Cook, other than the\nservices performed for the GNC for non-\nemployeedirector compensation. All services\nprovided to the HRC and our Board in 2020,\nother than those performed for the GNC for\nnon-employeedirector compensation, were pre-\napprovedby the HRC. In November 2020, the HRC\nassessed the independence of FW Cook and\nconcluded that no conflict of interest\nexists. Market Information Evaluation of\nmarket practices In order to make market-\ninformed decisions on compensation, the HRC\nreviews named executives\u0092 pay levels and the\nCompany\u0092s pay practices within the context of\nthose of our Labor Market Peer Group.\nSpecifically, the HRC reviewed compensation\ndata for the Labor Market Peer Group in\nconsidering the 2020 compensation actions for\nour named executives, including base salary\nlevels and target annual cash and long-term\nequity levels. In referencing market data,\nthe HRC does not target a specific\npercentile, but instead uses the data as a\nreference point. The Labor Market Peer Group\nconsists of ten companies with which we most\ndirectly compete for executive talent based\non requisite expertise, knowledge, and\nexperience. Our Labor Market Peer Group for\n2020 is shown below:\n                                              \n                 American                     \n                 Express        JPMorgan      \n                 Company        Chase\u00a0& Co.   \n                 Bank of        Morgan        \n                 America        Stanley The   \n                 Corporation    PNC           \n  Labor          The Bank of    Financial     \n  Market         New York       Services      \n  Peer Group     Mellon         Group, Inc.   \n                 Corporation    State Street  \n                 Citigroup      Corporation   \n                 Inc.

The HRC uses a Financial\nPerformance Peer Group to assess our relative\nperformance for purposes of assessing Company\nfinancial performance and as a TSR governor\nfor Performance Shares; the peer group is\nalso used for purposes of determining\nrelative performance for the Performance\nShares granted in 2020. The GSIBs selected by\nthe HRC best reflect those companies that\nWells Fargo competes with for capital and\ncustomers, and are most similar in terms of\nscope, scale, and business mix. The Financial\nPerformance Peer Group for 2020 is shown\nbelow:\n                                              \n                 Banco                        \n                 Santander,      HSBC         \n                 S.A.

of named executive direct pay\nelements and key design features for 2020\nrelated compensation. Our variable\ncompensation program is composed of annual\ncash bonus and long-term equity both of which\nare directly tied to performance (Company,\nindividual, and risk accountability).\nCompensation paid upon vesting of PSAs is\nbased on Company performance over a three-\nyear performance period and on an assessment\nof risk outcomes that may result in\nforfeiture or recovery of all or a portion of\nthe awards. For 2020, Mr. Scharf and the\nother named executives received half of their\nlong-term equity in the form of Performance\nShares and the other half in RSRs. The HRC\nbelieves a mix of performance-based and time-\nvested equity, including for our CEO, is\nconsistent with Labor Market Peer Group\ncompensation practices and appropriately\nbalances driving long-term Company\nperformance and retaining the senior\nleadership needed to advance the Company\u0092s\ntransformation. The Board and HRC will\ncontinue to evaluate the appropriate mix of\nlong-term equity awarded to our senior\nleaders, including the CEO, for alignment\nwith the Company\u0092s strategic priorities

New Hire Sign-On Bonuses and Buy-\nOut Equity Awards As part of our efforts to\nbuild out the senior management team and to\nattract and retain top executive talent, we\nhave provided in certain instances sign-on\nbonuses and buy-out equity awards for new\nhires.

Assessments The HRC\u0092s\ncompensation governance framework includes\nrisk-management assessments from Independent\nRisk Management, except for the CEO, for whom\nthe assessment is conducted by the HRC, and\nthe Chief Risk Officer and Chief Auditor, for\nwhom the assessment is conducted by the\nchairs of the Risk Committee and the Audit\nCommittee, respectively. Each named executive\nis subject to an independent review by the\nChief Risk Officer in order to assess the\nextent of his or her involvement and\naccountability (if any) related to risk\nevents that took place, or were identified,\nduring the year. Further, each named\nexecutive is assessed on the basis of driving\nmeasurable progress towards resolving\noutstanding regulatory matters and\ncommitments. As described under 2.\nPerformance Assessment and Compensation\nDetermination Framework, our Company\ncontinues to strengthen and further enhance\nthe oversight of our executive compensation\npractices and the scope of its risk\nmanagement processes. Clawback and Forfeiture\nPolicy To further strengthen the Company\u0092s\nrisk and control practices, we undertook a\nholistic review of our clawback policies and\nforfeiture provisions during 2020. As part of\nthis review, we engaged an external\ncompensation consultant to complete a market\nreview of peer practices and obtained\nfeedback from key internal stakeholders. This\nresulted in the HRC implementing a new,\nholistic Clawback and Forfeiture Policy\n(Policy) to replace two separate recoupment\nand clawback policies and performance-based\nvesting provisions maintained within award\nagreements. The new Policy is applicable for\ncompensation awarded on or after January 1,\n2021. By expanding the population of\nemployees and types of incentive compensation\nawards subject to the Policy, as well as\nclawback triggers, the new Policy strengthens\nthe HRC\u0092s and Board\u0092s ability to forfeit and\nrecover compensation (as appropriate). The\nPolicy is designed to discourage employees\n(including our named executives) from taking\nunnecessary or inappropriate risks that would\nadversely impact our Company or harm our\ncustomers. The new Policy provides the HRC\nand the Board with important tools they need\nto hold employees accountable. A summary of\nthe compensation-related actions the Company\ncan take under the Policy is set forth below.\n                                              \n  Tr\u2026       Des\u2026       Com\u2026

The   \n  amount shown for 2020 in column (e)\u00a0for     \n  RSRs was calculated by multiplying the      \n  number of shares subject to the awards by   \n  the NYSE closing price per share on the     \n  date of grant.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n         The Performance Shares included in   \n         column (e)\u00a0for 2020 and discussed    \n         above are (i)\u00a0subject to adjustment  \n         for each named executive upward (to  \n         a maximum of 150% of the target      \n         award) or downward (to zero),        \n         depending upon the achievement of    \n         certain absolute and relative        \n         performance conditions based on the  \n         average of our ROTCE for the three   \n         fiscal years ending on December\u00a031,  \n  (4)    2020, 2021, and 2022, (ii) limited   \n         to 125% of target unless the         \n         Company\u0092s relative TSR for the        \n         performance period is in the top     \n         quartile, (iii)\u00a0subject to further   \n         downward adjustment by 1/3 in the    \n         event our Company incurs a net       \n         operating loss for any year in the   \n         three-year performance period, and   \n         (iv)\u00a0subject to the HRC\u0092s discretion  \n         to cause the forfeiture of the       \n         awards.                              \n                                              \n                              \n  2021 Proxy Statement    89  \n                              \nExecutive Compensation\n                                              \n  Assuming (1)\u00a0that our Company\u0092s performance  \n  during the measurement period for the 2020  \n  Performance Share awards results in the     \n  maximum number of Performance Shares        \n  vesting, and (2)\u00a0the HRC does not           \n  exercise its discretion to cause the        \n  forfeiture of the Performance Shares, the   \n  named executives would be entitled to       \n  receive the number of Performance Shares    \n  having the related total service inception  \n  date fair value shown after his or her      \n  name:                                       \n  Mr.\u00a0Scharf \u0096 501,186 Performance Shares,     \n  $20,313,069; Mr.\u00a0Shrewsberry \u0096 85,803        \n  Performance Shares, $3,477,596; Ms.\u00a0Mack \u0096   \n  92,305 Performance Shares, $3,741,122; and  \n  Mr.\u00a0Powell \u0096 7,411 Performance Shares,       \n  $300,368.                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  Additional information about the            \n  Performance                                 \n  Shares and other awards appears in our      \n  CD&A and in                                 \n  the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table,      \n  footnotes,                                  \n  and related narrative.                      \n                                              \n                                              \n         Amounts shown in column (f)\u00a0for      \n         2020 reflect annual incentive        \n  (5)    non-equity awards made to each       \n         named executive in January 2021      \n         based on 2020 performance.           \n                                              \n                                              \n         Amounts shown in column (g)\u00a0for      \n         2020 represent the change in the     \n         actuarial present value of the       \n         named executive\u0092s pension benefits    \n         under our Cash Balance and           \n         Supplemental Cash Balance Plans      \n         from                                 \n         December\u00a031, 2019.

As a result of the           \n         continuing effects of the pandemic,  \n         the HRC determined that application  \n         of threshold goals was               \n         not appropriate for the year and     \n         determined to pay annual incentives  \n         to our bonus-eligible employees,     \n         including the named executives,      \n         under the Wells Fargo Bonus Plan.    \n                                              \n                                              \n         The potential equity incentive plan  \n         awards shown in columns (g)\u00a0and (h)  \n         represent the target and maximum     \n         number of Performance Share awards   \n         granted during 2020, with the value  \n         described in footnote (4)\u00a0of the     \n  (2)    Summary Compensation Table and       \n         included in column (e)\u00a0of the        \n         Summary Compensation Table.          \n         Additional information regarding     \n         the terms of these awards appears    \n         in the narrative following this      \n         table and in our CD&A.               \n                                              \n                                              \n         Under the applicable FASB ASC Topic  \n         718 rules, because the HRC has the   \n         discretion to cause all or a         \n         portion of any unpaid award to be    \n         forfeited upon the occurrence of     \n         certain trigger events, the \u0093grant    \n         date\u0094                                 \n         for (i)\u00a0the 2020 Performance Shares  \n         will not be determined until after   \n         the conclusion of the performance    \n         period, and (ii)\u00a0the RSRs will not   \n         be determined until the applicable   \n         vesting date. As a result, the       \n         total amount reported in column      \n         (k)\u00a0above represents the fair value  \n         of the 2020 Performance Share or     \n         RSR award on its \u0093service inception   \n  (3)    date\u0094 (i.e., the date the HRC         \n         approved each award), based (i)\u00a0for  \n         a Performance Share award upon the   \n         then-probable outcome                \n         of the ROTCE performance condition   \n         (i.e., the target value of the       \n         award), and (ii)\u00a0for an RSR award    \n         upon the full number of shares       \n         subject to the award.

date using the same             \n         assumptions and accounting policies  \n         (ASC 715) that we used to compute    \n         our benefit obligations under these  \n         plans and

Mr.\u00a0Shrewsberry. Because Ms.\u00a0Mack    \n         participated in the frozen           \n         Wachovia Pension Plan, and has more  \n         than 20 years of credited service,   \n         she would be entitled to receive     \n         her full retirement benefit under    \n         that plan at age 62. We therefore    \n         used 62 as Ms.\u00a0Mack\u0092s assumed         \n         retirement age for purposes of       \n         computing the pension benefit for    \n         her shown in the above table.        \n         Additional information about Ms.\u00a0    \n         Mack\u0092s pension benefit is provided    \n         below under Description of Pension   \n         Plans.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n         A description of the accounting      \n         policies, actuarial, and other       \n         assumptions we used to compute       \n         these benefits, except as noted      \n         above, can be found under Note 1     \n  (3)    and Note 21 to our 2020 financial    \n         statements included in our           \n         Annual Report on Form 10-K for the   \n         year ended December\u00a031, 2020.

As a result of this freeze,\nand except for investment credits as described\nbelow, no additional retirement benefits or\nadditional years of credited service have\naccrued for our named executives since this\ndate. Ms. Mack participated in the Wachovia\nPension Plan until it was merged into the Cash\nBalance Plan in July 2009. As a result of this\nmerger, all benefits accrued by Ms. Mack under\nthe Wachovia Pension Plan were also frozen. No\nadditional benefits have accrued to her since\nthat date, and her benefits will be paid to\nher from the Cash Balance Plan upon her\nretirement. Under the Cash Balance Plan,\npension benefits generally are determined by\nthe value of the employee\u0092s vested cash\nbalance account. Prior to the freeze of the\nCash Balance Plan in July 2009, we credited an\nemployee\u0092s account with compensation credits\nand investment credits each quarter. The\ncredits were based on a percentage of the\nemployee\u0092s certified compensation, as defined\nin the Cash Balance Plan, for the quarter,\ncalculated using the employee\u0092s age and years\nof credited service as of the end of each\nquarter. Employees who participated in the\nCash Balance Plan whose benefits under the\nCash Balance Plan were limited due to Internal\nRevenue Code (IRC) imposed limits or whose\nbenefits were limited because they chose to\ndefer a portion of their compensation into the\nDeferred Compensation Plan (defined below),\nalso participated in the Supplemental Cash\nBalance Plan. Under the Supplemental Cash\nBalance Plan, participants received\ncompensation and investment credits to their\nplan accounts, determined by points assigned\nto each employee at the end of each year based\non years of service and age. We continue to\ncredit each account under the Combined Plans,\non the last day of each quarter, with\ninvestment credits. For 2020, we determined\neach quarterly investment credit by\nmultiplying the amount of the account balance\nat the beginning of the quarter by 25% of an\naverage of 30-yearU.S. Treasury bond rates\n(adjusted quarterly). Under the Cash Balance\nPlan, the investment credit for each calendar\nquarter beginning on or after January 1, 2009\nis required to be not less than 25% of 2.83%.\nThis minimum rate does not apply to the\nSupplemental Cash Balance Plan. \u0093Normal\nretirement age\u0094 under the Combined Plans is\ndefined as age 65. We pay the value of the\nemployee\u0092s account balance under the Cash\nBalance Plan at any time after termination of\nemployment in either a lump sum or an\nactuarially equivalent monthly annuity as the\nemployee elects. We pay the value of an\nemployee\u0092s account balance in the Supplemental\nCash Balance Plan in either a lump sum or an\nactuarially equivalent monthly annuity in the\nyear following the employee\u0092s \u0093separation from\nservice\u0094 as defined in the Supplemental Cash\nBalance Plan and IRC Section 409A. Pursuant to\nIRC Section 409A and the terms of the\nSupplemental Cash Balance Plan, all employees\nwho were participants in the Supplemental Cash\nBalance Plan made an irrevocable election as\nto the form of distribution (lump sum or\nmonthly annuity) prior to December 31, 2008.\nIf no election was made, the Supplemental Cash\nBalance Plan provides for a lump sum\ndistribution of benefits. Because Mr.\nShrewsberry made no elections, he will receive\nhis respective benefits as lump sum\ndistributions.\n                              \n  2021 Proxy Statement    97  \n                              \nExecutive Compensation\n\n2020 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation The\nfollowing table provides information about\nthe participation by each named executive in\nour nonqualified deferred compensation plans.\nThe terms of the plans are described below\nthe table.\n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026                    \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026                    \u2026    \n                                              \n                        \u0097          \u0097            \n                        \u0097          \u0097            \n                                              \n                        \u0097          \u0097            \n                        \u0097          \u0097            \n                                              \n                       \u2026  )       \u2026           \n                       \u2026  )       \u0097            \n                                              \n                       \u2026          \u0097            \n                        \u0097          \u0097            \n                                              \n                        \u0097          \u0097            \n                        \u0097          \u0097            \n                                              \n                        \u0097          \u0097            \n                        \u0097          \u0097            \n                                              \n                                              \n         None of the earnings shown in        \n         column (d)\u00a0for Mr.\u00a0Shrewsberry has   \n         been included in the Summary         \n         Compensation Table because none is   \n         \u0093preferential\u0094 or \u0093above-market.\u0094 As     \n         discussed                            \n         in footnote (7)\u00a0to the Summary       \n         Compensation Table, $23,343 of the   \n         earnings shown for Ms.\u00a0Mack in       \n         column (d)\u00a0above represents          \n  (1)    earnings on deferred compensation    \n         under the frozen Wachovia Deferred   \n         Compensation Plan                    \n         discussed below at an interest rate  \n         (the prime rate averaged over four   \n         quarters plus 2%) that may be        \n         deemed \u0093preferential\u0094 or               \n         \u0093above-market.\u0094 As required by SEC     \n         rules, this amount has been          \n         included for Ms.\u00a0Mack in column      \n         (g)\u00a0to the Summary Compensation      \n         Table.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n         Amounts earned as salary or cash     \n         incentive and deferred by the named  \n         executives are included in column    \n         (f), and have been disclosed in the  \n         Summary Compensation Table and       \n         related footnotes in our proxy       \n         statements for each prior year in    \n         which we included the named          \n         executive.

For 2020, compensation eligible for\ndeferral includes salaries, incentives,\ncommissions, and bonuses earned during 2020\nand payable no later than March 15, 2021,\nsubject to any limitations on the\ncompensation amount or type determined by the\nplan administrator. The Deferred Compensation\nPlan also provides for supplemental Company\nmatching contributions related to any\ncompensation deferred by a plan participant,\nincluding named executives, that would have\nbeen eligible (up to certain IRS limits) but\nfor this deferral, for a matching\ncontribution under the 401(k) Plan. The\nDeferred Compensation Plan currently offers\nthe following three broad categories of\nearnings options, which generally mirror the\ninvestment options offered in the 401(k)\nPlan:\n                                              \n      CD Investment Option. Under the CD      \n      investment option, deferred             \n      compensation will earn the same return  \n      as if it were a                         \n      $10,000 certificate of deposit with a   \n      maturity of one year sold by Wells      \n      Fargo Bank, N.A. and available in       \n      Minnesota.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      Funds Investment Option. Under the      \n      funds investment option, deferred       \n      compensation will earn the same return  \n      as if                                   \n      invested in one or more fund            \n      investments selected by the             \n      participant. The table below shows the  \n      fund investments selected by one or     \n      more named executives during 2020, and  \n      the \u0093total return\u0094 for each such option,  \n      as that term is defined in              \n      footnote (1)\u00a0to the table. The funds    \n      investment options available to all     \n      plan participants during 2020,          \n      including the named executives, are     \n      listed in footnote (2)\u00a0to the table.    \n                                              \n                                              \n      Common Stock Investment Option. Under   \n      the Company common stock investment     \n      option, deferred compensation will      \n      earn the                                \n      same return as if invested in our       \n      common stock, including reinvestment    \n      of dividends.                           \n                                              \nAn employee may allocate deferred\ncompensation among the earnings options in\nincrements of 1% and may elect to reallocate\nhis or her deferral account as of each\nbusiness day. However, any deferral amounts\nallocated to the common stock option are\nrequired to remain in that investment option\nand may not be reallocated.

An employee may not make an\nearly withdrawal of any portion of a deferral\naccount for amounts deferred for 2004 or\nlater, but may withdraw all or a portion of a\ndeferral account for amounts deferred on or\nafter January 1, 2013 due to an unforeseeable\nemergency, as defined in the Deferred\nCompensation Plan. Early withdrawal of\namounts deferred for 2003 or earlier are\ngoverned by the terms of the Deferred\nCompensation Plan in effect at the time of\nthe deferral.\n                              \n  2021 Proxy Statement    99  \n                              \nExecutive Compensation\n\nOnce selected, the employee cannot change the\nmethod of distribution, except that an\nemployee may elect one time (subject to\ncertain requirements) to re-defera\ndistribution to a year that is at least five\nyears after the date originally selected if\nit relates to a deferral for 2005 or later,\nor at least three years after the date\noriginally selected if it relates to a\ndeferral for 2004 or earlier. The Deferred\nCompensation Plan specifies certain timing\nfor distributions after a separation from\nservice, as defined in the plan and IRC\nSection 409A, depending on whether the\nseparation from service occurs before or\nafter the originally scheduled distribution\ndate. Supplemental 401(k) Plan Mr.\nShrewsberry participated in the Supplemental\n401(k) Plan until it was frozen on July 1,\n2009. The Supplemental 401(k) Plan was an\nunfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation\nplan designed to restore certain benefits\nunder the Wells Fargo 401(k) Plan lost due to\nIRC-imposedlimits on contributions and/or\neligible compensation. Supplemental 401(k)\nPlan account contributions are treated as if\ninvested in our common stock, and are\ncredited to reflect dividends paid. Prior to\nJanuary 1, 2015, all dividend allocations\nwere treated as if reinvested in our common\nstock; after January 1, 2015, dividend\nallocations are credited to the CD investment\noption unless the employee elects before the\ndividend payment date to have the dividend\ntreated as if reinvested in our common stock.\nInformation regarding the CD investment\noption and our common stock, including the\napplicable dividend rate per share is shown\nunder Deferred Compensation Plan above. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, Mr. Shrewsberry had 10,315\nshares credited to his account. We will\ndistribute an employee\u0092s vested Supplemental\n401(k) Plan account balance following a\nseparation from service as defined in the\nplan, either in a lump sum or in installments\nas previously elected by the employee, in the\nform of (a) shares of our common stock, with\ncash for any fractional shares and for\ndividend allocations after January 1, 2015,\nor (b) cash, depending on the investment\nallocations (common stock or the CD\ninvestment option) made by the employee.\nWachovia Deferred Compensation Plan As a\nformer Wachovia executive, Ms. Mack\nparticipated in the Wachovia Deferred\nCompensation Plan. Participation in this plan\nwas frozen and contributions to the plan\nceased, effective December 31, 2001. The\nWachovia Deferred Compensation Plan was an\nunfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation\nplan that allowed certain highly compensated\nand management employees to defer base salary\nand/or incentive payments until a future date\n(generally retirement, death, or separation\nfrom service). Participants\u0092 account balances\nare credited on December 31 each year with a\nrate of interest equal to the average of the\nPrime Rate over four quarters plus 2%. The\nplan specifies the form and term of payment\nfor participants\u0092 account balances and\npermits early withdrawal of account balances\nin certain circumstances, including periodic\nearly voluntary withdrawals (subject to a 6%\nearly withdrawal penalty) and in the case of\nan emergency resulting in severe financial\nhardship. Potential Post-Employment Payments\nWe do not have employment or other severance\nagreements with our named executives. The\ntable below shows estimated post-employment\npayments for our named executives serving as\nof December 31, 2020, assuming they had\nterminated employment on that day. To\nestimate the payment amounts for each named\nexecutive, we used the closing price of our\ncommon stock on December 31, 2020 of $30.18.\nThe following items are not included in the\ntable or description below:\n                                              \n      Retirement benefits under our Cash      \n      Balance Plan and Supplemental Cash      \n      Balance Plan, which are described       \n      above under                             \n      Pension Benefits.                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      Distributions of balances under our     \n      deferred compensation plans and         \n      Supplemental 401(k) Plan, which         \n      balances are shown in                   \n      the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation  \n      table above.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      Payments and benefits provided on a     \n      non-discriminatory basis to employees   \n      upon                                    \n      termination of employment.

Audit\nCommittee policy prohibits KPMG from\nproviding certain non-auditservices to us and\nrequires all audit and permissible non-\nauditservices provided by KPMG to be pre-\napprovedby the Audit Committee. There are\nthree methods for pre-approvingKPMG services.\n                                              \n      The Audit Committee may pre-approve,    \n      on an annual basis, recurring services  \n      such as                                 \n      the audits of our annual financial      \n      statements and internal control over    \n      financial reporting and the review of   \n      our quarterly financial statements.     \n      Preliminary fee levels will not exceed  \n      amounts pre-approved for                \n      these services in the preceding         \n      calendar year, and a subsequent         \n      refinement of the actual fees incurred  \n      as a result of changes in the scope of  \n      services will be submitted to the       \n      Audit Committee for pre-approval.       \n      The Audit Committee or a designee must  \n      pre-approve changes in the scope of     \n      recurring services if they will result  \n      in fee increases in excess of a         \n      relatively small amount established by  \n      the Audit Committee                     \n      prior to such additional services       \n      being provided by KPMG. Changes in the  \n      scope of pre-approved services with     \n      estimated costs less than that amount   \n      may be approved by the Chief            \n      Accounting Officer and                  \n      Controller.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      The Audit Committee may pre-approve,    \n      for a particular calendar year,         \n      specific types                          \n      of audit, audit-related, advisory,      \n      consulting, or tax services that could  \n      arise with respect to that calendar     \n      year that were not already              \n      pre-approved as recurring services,     \n      subject to a fee cap for each           \n      category for that year.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      The Audit Committee may pre-approve,    \n      from time to time during the year,      \n      services                                \n      that have neither been pre-approved as  \n      recurring services nor pre-approved     \n      pursuant to the categorical             \n      pre-approval described                  \n      above.                                  \n                                              \nIn determining whether to pre-approvethe\nprovision by KPMG of a permissible non-\nauditservice, the Audit Committee considers\nthe facts and circumstances of the\nengagement, including other non-auditservices\nprovided by KPMG and the fees for those\nservices, and whether the provision of the\nnon-auditservice by KPMG could impair the\nindependence of KPMG with respect to us. The\nAudit Committee also considers whether KPMG\nis best positioned to provide the service\nbecause of its familiarity with our business,\nculture, accounting systems, risk profile,\nand other factors, and whether there are\nalternatives reasonably available to us and\nthe cost of those alternatives. The Audit\nCommittee requires competitive bidding for\nservices that are eligible for categorical\npre-approvaland services subject to\nindividual pre-approvalunless it is not\nwarranted because of the facts and\ncircumstances of the proposed engagement. The\nAudit Committee has delegated pre-\napprovalauthority to designated Audit\nCommittee members. Pre-approvalby a\ndesignated Audit Committee member is used for\ntime-sensitive engagements. Pre-\napprovaldecisions by a designated Audit\nCommittee member are reported to the full\nAudit Committee at a future meeting.\n                                \n  108    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nShareholder Proposals Our Engagement with and\nResponsiveness to Shareholders Wells Fargo\nvalues and considers the feedback we receive\nfrom our investors and other stakeholders and\nhas consistently acted to enhance our\ngovernance practices and transparency through\nour disclosures in response to those\nperspectives.

We     \n      continue to monitor our progress of     \n      enhancing diversity at all levels of    \n      our Company using various internal and  \n      external metrics, including the actual  \n      percentage of women and                 \n      racially/ethnically diverse             \n      individuals at all levels of the        \n      Company.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n      Climate Change.

Shareholders will\nvote on the following shareholder proposals\n(Items 4 through 7), if they are properly\npresented at our annual meeting and not\npreviously withdrawn. The text of these\nproposals and supporting statements appear in\nthe form in which we received them. The\nproposals may contain assertions about our\nCompany that we believe are incorrect. We\nhave not attempted to refute any\ninaccuracies. We provide the name and address\nof the lead proponent for each shareholder\nproposal, as well as the number of shares\nheld (if available). We will supply the name\nand address of, and number of shares held (if\navailable) by any co-filerupon oral or\nwritten request to our Corporate Secretary.\n                               \n  2021 Proxy Statement    109  \n                               \nShareholder Proposals\n\nItem 4 \u0096 Shareholder Proposal \u0096 Make\nShareholder Proxy Access More Accessible\n                                              \n  John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue,         \n  No.\u00a0205, Redondo Beach, CA 90278, the       \n  holder of 100 shares of our common stock,   \n  has advised us that he intends to           \n  introduce the following resolution at our   \n  annual meeting:                             \n                                              \nResolution and Supporting Statement Proposal\n4 \u0096 Improve Our Catch-22Proxy Access\nShareholders request that our board of\ndirectors take the steps necessary to enable\nas many shareholders as may be needed to\naggregate their shares to equal 3% of our\nstock owned continuously for 3-yearsin order\nto enable shareholder proxy access. Due to\nthe disgusting parade of Wells Fargo\ncorporate scandals it would be an advantage\nto have a more readily useable version of\nshareholder proxy access to elect new ethical\nwatchdog directors. Perhaps the fastest way\nto find more information on these scandals is\nto check Wells Fargo in Wikipedia. Higher\ncosts charged to African-American and\nHispanic borrowers Failure to monitor\nsuspected money laundering Fines regarding\nOverdraft fees Settlement and fines regarding\nmortgage servicing practices SEC fine due to\ninadequate risk disclosures Wells Fargo sued\nfor allegedly defrauding the US Federal\nHousing Administration (FHA) for 10-years\nWells Fargo settled a suit with 24,000\nFlorida homeowners regarding inflated\npremiums on lender-placed insurance Lawsuit\nregarding excessive overdraft fees Public\nCampaign criticized Wells Fargo for spending\n$11 million on lobbying and not paying any\ntaxes during 2008-2010, instead getting $681\nmillion in tax rebates, despite making a\nprofit of $49 billion, laying off 6,385\nworkers since 2008, and increasing executive\npay by 180% to $50 million in 2010 for its\ntop 5 executives Controversial prison\nindustry investment SEC settlement for\ninsider trading Wells Fargo fake accounts\nscandal Racketeering lawsuit for mortgage\nappraisal overcharges Controversial Dakota\nAccess Pipeline investment Controversial\nconnections to the gun Industry and NRA\nDiscrimination against female workers Wells\nFargo agreed to pay $385 million to settle a\nlawsuit after saddling millions of customers\nwith unneeded auto insurance The current\narbitrary ration of 20 shareholders to\ninitiate shareholder proxy access can be\ncalled Catch-22Proxy Access. To assemble 20\nshareholders, who have owned 3% of company\nstock for an unbroken 3-years,one would\nreasonably need to start with 60 activist\nshareholders who own 9% of company stock for\nan unbroken 3-yearsbecause initiating proxy\naccess is a complicated process that is\neasily susceptible to errors and dropouts.\nThe 60 activist shareholders might then be\nwhittled down to 40 shareholders because some\nshareholders would be unable to timely meet\nall the paper chase requirements. After the\n40 shareholders submit their paperwork to\nmanagement \u0096 then management might\narbitrarily claim that 10 shareholders do not\nmeet the requirements (figuring that\nshareholders do not want a battle in court)\nand management might convince another 10\nshareholders to drop out \u0096 leaving 20\nshareholders. But the current bylaws do not\nallow 40 shareholders to submit their\npaperwork to management to end up with 20\nqualified shareholders. As any analogy such\nan arbitrary maximum limit of 20 shareholders\ndoes not apply to shareholders acting by\nwritten consent or to shareholders calling\nfor a special shareholder meeting.

We believe that\nthe parameters set out in our proxy access\nBy-Lawprovision, including our limitation on\nthe number of shareholders that can comprise\na nominating group, are reasonable and strike\nan appropriate balance between promoting\nshareholder rights and protecting the long-\nterm interests of all of our shareholders.\nAllowing an appropriately limited number of\nshareholders who have owned a meaningful\ninterest in the Company for a reasonable\nperiod of time to act as a group aligns with\nthe principle that the right to nominate a\ndirector using the Company\u0092s proxy statement\nshould be available only for those who have a\nsufficient financial stake in the Company and\nare committed to the Company\u0092s long-term\nsuccess. Limiting proxy access in this way\nhelps ensure that the interests of the\nshareholders accessing our proxy statement\nare aligned with the interests of a majority\nof our long-term shareholders. The\nproponent\u0092s proposal is unnecessary given our\ncommitment to strong and effective corporate\ngovernance principles and practices. Our\nCompany maintains strong corporate governance\npractices that include majority voting for\ndirector elections; annual election of all\ndirectors; a requirement that our Chairman be\nan independent director; and rights of our\nshareholders to call special meetings and to\nact by written consent. In addition, since\n2010, our Company has had a Board-ledinvestor\noutreach program with independent director\nparticipation to better understand the views\nof our investors on key corporate governance\ntopics. During 2020, our independent Chairman\nand management contacted and held engagement\nmeetings with a significant number of our\ninstitutional investors through the Board-\nledinvestor engagement program. The feedback\nwe receive from our investors helps us\nrespond to investor issues and to continue to\nenhance our corporate governance practices\nand disclosures. Our existing proxy access\nprovision is in line with best practices\nreflected in the market. A recent study\npublished by Sidley Austin LLP summarizes\nproxy access provisions adopted since January\n1, 2015 and, after analyzing provisions\nadopted by 644 companies, concludes that a\nnominating group size limit of 20 was by far\nthe most common limit, averaging 93% of the\ncompanies surveyed. In addition, setting a\nreasonable limit of 20 on the number of\nshareholders that can comprise a nominating\ngroup is critical to controlling\nadministrative costs and burdens that would\nimpact our Company if there were no limit on\nthe number of shareholders who could\naggregate their shares to reach an ownership\nlevel representing a meaningful interest in\nthe Company. For the reasons set out above,\nwe believe the changes put forward in the\nproposal are not in the best interests of the\nCompany and its shareholders, are unnecessary\nin light of the Company\u0092s existing proxy\naccess By-Lawprovision and commitment to\nstrong corporate governance, would be out of\nstep with prevailing market practice and\nwould create overly burdensome administrative\nrequirements and costs. Our Board recommends\nthat you vote AGAINST this proposal (Item 4).\n                               \n  2021 Proxy Statement    111  \n                               \nShareholder Proposals\n\nItem 5 \u0096 Shareholder Proposal \u0096 Amend\nCertificate of Incorporation to Become a\nDelaware Public Benefit Corporation\n                                              \n  Harrington Investments, Inc., 1001          \n  2nd Street, Suite 325, Napa, CA 94559, the  \n  holder of 100 shares of our common stock,   \n  has advised us that it intends to           \n  introduce the following resolution at our   \n  annual meeting:                             \n                                              \nResolution and Supporting Statement Our\ncompany is suffering a prolonged crisis of\npublic, government, and consumer trust,\npaying over 21.1 billion dollars in penalties\nsince 2000; The crisis has caused our company\nto lose the trust of our depositors, due to\nthe 3.5 million accounts using fictitious or\nunauthorized customer information ($185\nmillion dollars in penalties) and 800,000\npeople forced to take redundant auto\ninsurance from 2012 to 2017 ($80 million\ndollars in refunds and compensation); The\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau and\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency\nsettled with our company for $1 billion for\nfailure to manage risk, and the United States\nDepartment of Justice settled for $2 billion\nover mortgage backed securities originated by\nWells Fargo; In a House Financial Services\nCommittee hearing the Chair stated: \u0093Wells\nFargo\u0092s ongoing lawlessness and failure to\nright the ship, suggests the bank is simply\ntoo big to manage\u0094, and \u0093regulators seem\nunwilling to take forceful actions;\u0094 In 2019\nat shareholders\u0092 request, our company\u0092s\nGovernance and Nominating Committee produced\na report on the feasibility of Wells Fargo\nbecoming a Delaware Public Benefit\nCorporation (PBC), but the board declined to\nrecommend conversion of the company to a PBC.\nIn July 2020, Delaware adopted new amendments\nto the public benefit law that made the\nadoption of the new structure more attractive\nand accessible.\n[https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-\namendments-to-delaware-general-76927/].The\namended law reduces certain board member\nfiduciary liabilities for breaches of\nstakeholder interests and reduces the\nrequired shareholder approval of a PBC\nconversion from supermajority to a majority\nvote. Since our CEO signed on to the Business\nRoundtable (BRT) statement of the purpose of\nthe corporation expressing support to rebuild\ntrust, transform our company and better serve\nstakeholders, implementation of the amended\nDelaware public benefit law at our company\nappears to the proponent to be timely and\nnecessary. Through PBC conversion, our\ncompany would have expanded accountability to\nshareholders for the interests of those\nmaterially affected by the corporation\u0092s\nconduct, including depositors, regulators and\nothers who have lost trust in the company,\nand a new legal obligation to report on the\ncompany\u0092s impact on those stakeholders;\nResolved:that Shareholders request the Board\nto approve an amendment to the company\u0092s\nRestated Certificate of Incorporation to\nbecome a Public Benefit Corporation pursuant\nto Delaware law, and to submit the proposed\namendment to shareholders for approval. Such\na change would enable the company to operate\nin a responsible and sustainable manner that\nbalances the stockholders\u0092 pecuniary\ninterests, and the best interests of those\nmaterially affected by the corporation\u0092s\nconduct. Supporting Statement :The proponent\nrecommends that the Board, in its discretion,\nconsider stating the public purpose in the\namended certificate that reflects a forward\nlooking vision regarding the company\u0092s\nimpacts on stakeholders. For example, the\npurpose in the certificate could be stated as\n\u0093providing fair, inclusive and equitable\naccess to financial services in a diverse\nworld.\u0094\n                                \n  112    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nShareholder Proposals\n\nPosition of the Board Our Board recommends a\nvote AGAINST this proposal, which is\nidentified as Item 5 on the proxy card, for\nthe following reasons:\n                                              \n      In 2020, the Board commissioned and     \n      published an independent third-party    \n      study and report on the feasibility of  \n      taking                                  \n      the necessary actions to become a       \n      Delaware public benefit corporation.    \n      The Board concluded, and continues to   \n      believe, that converting to a Delaware  \n      public benefit corporation is not in    \n      the best interests of the Company and   \n      is unnecessary because the              \n      Company\u0092s existing corporate form        \n      provides our management team and Board  \n      with appropriate flexibility to         \n      promote the interests of our various    \n      stakeholders and to manage important    \n      public benefit issues without\u00a0          \n      incurring the costs and                 \n      generating the uncertainties, risks,    \n      and distractions involved with          \n      converting to a public benefit          \n      corporation.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      Wells Fargo has long believed that it   \n      has a fundamental commitment to all of  \n      its stakeholders, including customers,  \n      employees, regulators, suppliers,       \n      communities, and shareholders, and      \n      that focusing on the needs of all of    \n      its stakeholders drives long-term       \n      value creation. Under Wells Fargo\u0092s      \n      existing corporate governance           \n      structure, the Board\u0092s Corporate         \n      Responsibility Committee oversees \u0096 and  \n      our management team directs \u0096 Wells      \n      Fargo\u0092s policies, programs, and          \n      strategies regarding public interest    \n      and social responsibility matters.      \n                                              \n                                              \n      We are committed to transparency        \n      regarding our public benefit            \n      strategies, activities, and             \n      performance, including our              \n      support of our customers, communities,  \n      and employees during the COVID-19       \n      pandemic, through our public            \n      disclosures in the Company\u0092s             \n      Environmental, Social, and Governance   \n      (ESG) report, on our website, and       \n      in this proxy statement.                \n                                              \nUncertainties, Risks, Costs, and Distractions\nInvolved with Converting to a Public Benefit\nCorporation In 2019, the Company received a\nshareholder proposal from the same proponent\nof this proposal requesting that the Board\ncommission an independent study to assess the\nfeasibility of taking the necessary actions\nto become a Delaware public benefit\ncorporation. The Board, acting through its\nGovernance and Nominating Committee, engaged\na law firm to conduct the study and prepare a\nreport in response to the 2019 proposal. The\nBoard published the third party report on the\nCompany\u0092s website along with the Company\u0092s\nand the Board\u0092s response to the report in\nJanuary 2020, available at https://www.wellsf\nargo.com/assets/pdf/about/corporate/public-\nbenefit-corporations-report.pdf. Based on its\nreview of the third party report and Wells\nFargo\u0092s existing public benefit activities,\nthe Board concluded that converting to a\nDelaware public benefit corporation is not in\nthe best interests of the Company and is\nunnecessary because the Company\u0092s existing\ncorporate governance structure provides our\nmanagement team and Board with appropriate\nflexibility to promote the interests of our\nvarious stakeholders and to manage important\npublic benefit issues without incurring the\ncosts and generating the uncertainties and\nrisks involved with becoming a public benefit\ncorporation. For many of the same reasons,\nthe Board continues to believe that\nconverting to a public benefit corporation is\nneither necessary nor in the best interests\nof the Company. Although certain amendments\nhave been made to the provisions of the\nGeneral Corporation Law of the State of\nDelaware governing public benefit\ncorporations since the Board issued the\nCompany\u0092s response to the independent study\nand report, there continue to be significant\nuncertainties, risks, costs, and distractions\nthat would be involved with converting to a\nDelaware public benefit corporation and the\nassociated requirement that the Company\u0092s\ndirectors manage the Company in a manner that\nbalances shareholders\u0092 pecuniary interests,\nthe best interests of those materially\naffected by the Company\u0092s conduct, and the\nspecific public benefits that would be\nspecified in the Company\u0092s Certificate of\nIncorporation. To the Company\u0092s knowledge, to\ndate only two U.S. publicly traded\ncorporations, including one financial\ninstitution, have converted to Delaware\npublic benefit corporations, and no U.S.\nglobal systemically important bank (G-SIB)has\ndone so. As a result of the lack of precedent\nregarding the management of a public benefit\ncorporation and case law in Delaware that\nprovides guidance regarding the balancing\nobligation of directors of public benefit\ncorporations, there is uncertainty and risk\nregarding decision-making in a public benefit\ncorporation that does not exist in a\nconventional corporation where the interests\nof shareholders and other stakeholders\ndiverge, including uncertainty about the\nfiduciary duties of directors in balancing\ndivergent stakeholder interests and the risks\nand costs associated with potential\nderivative lawsuits against directors for\nallegedly failing to properly balance\nshareholder and public benefit interests. In\naddition, there would be uncertainty\nregarding the regulatory treatment of Wells\nFargo as a large, publicly-traded G-SIBand\nmarket uncertainty about the impact that a\nconversion to a public benefit corporation\nwould have on the Company\u0092s short and long-\nterm stock price and overall financial\nperformance. The conversion to become a\npublic benefit corporation would be a costly\nand\n                               \n  2021 Proxy Statement    113  \n                               \nShareholder Proposals\n\nlengthy process, and assessing and addressing\nthese uncertainties and risks would distract\nour key leaders from their day-to-\ndaymanagement responsibilities, including our\ncurrent focus on the work we need to do to\nstrengthen our risk and control foundation\nand address outstanding regulatory matters.\nIn light of Wells Fargo\u0092s existing\nconsideration of stakeholder interests,\npublic benefit activities and disclosures,\nand the uncertainties, risks, and costs\ninvolved with converting to a Delaware public\nbenefit corporation, the Board and the\nCompany continue to believe that becoming a\npublic benefit corporation is neither\nappropriate nor necessary and thus not in the\nbest interests of the Company. Wells Fargo Is\nFocused on the Needs of All of Our\nStakeholders We understand that we have a\nfundamental commitment to all of our\nstakeholders, including customers, employees,\nregulators, suppliers, communities, and\nshareholders, and that business decisions\nthat take into account and advance the\ninterests of all of our stakeholders drive\nlong-term value creation and are therefore\nconsistent with our Board\u0092s fiduciary duties\nunder Delaware law. Moreover, one of the\nfirst actions taken by our CEO, Charles W.\nScharf, was to express his support for, and\nsign on to, the Business Roundtable Statement\non the Purpose of a Corporation, which\nrepresents a commitment by the signing\ncompanies to deliver value for all of their\nstakeholders. Under Wells Fargo\u0092s existing\ncorporate governance structure, the Board\u0092s\nCorporate Responsibility Committee oversees \u0096\nand our management team directs \u0096 policies,\nprograms, and strategies regarding social and\npublic responsibility matters, including\nenvironmental sustainability and climate\nchange, human rights, and supplier diversity,\nour significant Government Relations\nstrategies, policies, and programs, our\ncommunity development and reinvestment\nactivities, and our social impact and\nsustainability strategy and impact through\nthe support of non-profit organizations. In\nconnection with its oversight activities, the\nCorporate Responsibility Committee works\nclosely with management\u0092s Public Affairs\norganization, which includes groups within\nthe Company focused on social impact and\nsustainability, government relations and\npublic policy, and communications. The\nCorporate Responsibility Committee also\nmonitors the Company\u0092s relationships and\nreputation with external stakeholders,\nincluding by receiving feedback from the\nCompany\u0092s external Stakeholder Advisory\nCouncil, which is composed of national\nthought leaders representing stakeholder\ngroups important to the Company, including\ngroups focused on human rights, consumer\nrights, fair lending, the environment, civil\nrights, and governance, and reporting such\nfeedback to the Board to inform its decision-\nmaking. Wells Fargo\u0092s Response to the\nCOVID-19Pandemic Since the outbreak of the\nCOVID-19pandemic, Wells Fargo\u0092s actions to\nsupport its customers, communities, and\nemployees have further demonstrated the\nCompany\u0092s commitment to promoting critical\npublic benefit issues and serving the\ninterests of these stakeholders. Our actions\nto support individuals and communities\nexperiencing hardship as a result of the\nCOVID-19pandemic have included fee waivers,\npayment deferrals, and other expanded\nassistance for customers; charitable\ndonations from the Wells Fargo Foundation to\nhelp address food, shelter, small business,\nand housing stability, and to help public\nhealth organizations fighting to contain the\nspread of the COVID-19pandemic; a commitment\nto donate all gross processing fees received\nin 2020 from funding of Paycheck Protection\nProgram loans by creating the Open for\nBusiness Fund, which provides support to\nstruggling small businesses, impacted by the\nCOVID-19pandemic; and supporting the well-\nbeing and safety of our employees, including\nthrough various safety measures and the\nprovision of additional payments and benefits\nto certain employees. These and the Company\u0092s\nother ongoing initiatives and actions,\nincluding those relating to promoting\neconomic empowerment, addressing and\nmitigating environmental and climate change\nrisks, community giving, and diversity,\nequity, and inclusion, demonstrate our\ncommitment to operating in a responsible and\nsustainable manner that takes into account\nthe interests of all of our stakeholders.\nWells Fargo\u0092s Public Disclosures on its\nPublic Interest and Social Responsibility\nActivities and Performance Wells Fargo is\ncommitted to transparency regarding its\npublic benefit strategies, activities, and\nperformance through robust public\ndisclosures, which have been significantly\nenhanced over the past year.

For the reasons\ndiscussed above, our Board continues to\nbelieve that undertaking the costly and\nlengthy process of converting to a public\nbenefit corporation is neither appropriate\nnor necessary and thus is not in the best\ninterests of the Company. Our existing\ncorporate governance structure provides our\nmanagement team and Board with appropriate\nflexibility to promote the interests of our\nvarious stakeholders and manage important\npublic benefit issues without incurring the\ncosts and generating the uncertainties,\nrisks, and distractions involved with\nconverting to a public benefit corporation.\nOur Board recommends that you vote AGAINST\nthis proposal (Item 5).\n                               \n  2021 Proxy Statement    115  \n                               \nShareholder Proposals\n\nItem 6 \u0096 Shareholder Proposal \u0096 Report on\nIncentive-Based Compensation and Risks of\nMaterial Losses\n                                              \n  The Comptroller of the State of New         \n  York, Thomas P.

In response, Congress directed\nfederal regulators to examine the financial\nincentives of allbank employees\u0096not just\nexecutives\u0096whose actions can threaten the\nsafety of individual banks or the banking\nsystem itself. Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank\nAct requires regulation to disclose the\nstructures of all incentive-based\ncompensation arrangements to determine\nwhether it could lead to material financial\nloss. A 2016 rulemaking proposed by a variety\nof federal agencies states, \u0093Well-structured\nincentive-based compensation arrangements can\npromote the health of a financial institution\nby aligning the interests of executives and\nemployees with those of the institution\u0092s\nshareholders and other stakeholders. At the\nsame time, poorly structured incentive-based\ncompensation arrangements can provide\nexecutives and employees with incentives to\ntake inappropriate risks that are not\nconsistent with the long-term health of the\ninstitution and, in turn, the long-term\nhealth of the U.S. economy.\u0094 Basel III, the\nglobal banking regulatory reform standard,\nurges banks to identify material risk takers\nother than executives and disclose their\nfixed and variable remuneration. Wells Fargo\ndiscloses the compensation of named executive\nofficers but does not disclose information\nregarding the compensation of otheremployees\nwho receive incentive-based compensation, and\nwho could expose our company to material\nlosses. Because investors, like regulators,\nhave significant interests in understanding\nrisks that could expose Wells Fargo to\nmaterial losses, Wells Fargo should disclose\nthis information to shareholders. RESOLVED,\nShareholders request that the Board prepare a\nreport, at reasonable cost, disclosing to the\nextent permitted under applicable law and\nWells Fargo\u0092s contractual, fiduciary or other\nobligations (1) whether and how the Company\nhas identified employees or positions,\nindividually or as part of a group, who are\neligible to receive incentive-based\ncompensation that is tied to metrics that\ncould have the ability to expose Wells Fargo\nto possible material losses, as determined in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples; (2) if the Company has not made\nsuch an identification, an explanation of why\nit has not done so; and (3) if the Company\nhas made such an identification, the:\n                                              \n  (a)    methodology and criteria used to     \n         make such identification;            \n                                              \n                                              \n         number of those                      \n  (b)    employees/positions, broken down by  \n         division;                            \n                                              \n                                              \n         aggregate percentage of              \n         compensation, broken down by         \n  (c)    division, paid to those              \n         employees/positions that             \n         constitutes incentive-based          \n         compensation; and                    \n                                              \n                                              \n         aggregate percentage of such         \n         incentive-based compensation that    \n         is dependent on (i)\u00a0short-term, and  \n  (d)    (ii)\u00a0long-term performance metrics,  \n         in each case as may be defined by    \n         Wells Fargo and with an explanation  \n         of                                   \n         such metrics.                        \n                                              \nPosition of the Board Our Board recommends a\nvote AGAINST this proposal, which is\nidentified as Item 6 on the proxy card, for\nthe following reasons:\n                                              \n      Our Incentive Compensation Risk         \n      Management program, which is overseen   \n      by the Board\u0092s Human Resources           \n      Committee,                              \n      covers all incentive-eligible roles     \n      across the Company and consideration    \n      of all of our financial and             \n      non-financial risks.

All incentive plans undergo\nan annual risk review under this program. We\nare committed to developing and implementing\nsound and effective incentive compensation\nprograms that reinforce the right behaviors,\nappropriately balance risk and financial\nrewards, and comply with applicable laws and\nregulations. Our performance management and\nincentive compensation programs, policies and\npractices support this goal. As highlighted\nearlier in the Performance Management and\nIncentive Compensationsection in this proxy\nstatement, we regularly review and have\ncontinued to enhance our performance\nmanagement and compensation programs,\npolicies, and practices, with a focus on risk\nmanagement and risk accountability. Our ICRM\nprogram governs the policies, standards and\nprocesses for managing incentive compensation\nrisk, which consider all of our financial and\nnon-financialrisks.\n                                              \n      We consider risk management in the      \n      design of all incentive compensation    \n      programs.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      Our ICRM program covers all employees   \n      who are eligible to participate in an   \n      incentive compensation program,         \n      including                               \n      those in Identified Roles.              \n                                              \n                                              \n      Our incentive design process supports   \n      the design and assessment of incentive  \n      compensation programs to incorporate    \n      balancing                               \n      features and risk adjustments, and all  \n      plans are subject to an annual review   \n      to consider if they meet these goals.   \n                                              \n                                              \n      The design process includes review of   \n      past performance of existing plans, a   \n      risk evaluation to identify potential   \n      areas of                                \n      risk, modeling to understand expected   \n      results, scenario testing, and an       \n      assessment of plan reasonableness.      \n                                              \nRisk management is also considered in\ndeveloping employees\u0092 annual performance\nobjectives, during annual reviews for\nincentive compensation programs, and in\nconducting annual individual performance\nevaluations. As part of our risk management\npractices, each employee\u0092s performance\nobjectives include a risk accountability\nelement that includes the evaluation of\nsignificant risk management issues or\nfailures, including certain types of employee\nmisconduct.

In addition, for\nIdentified Roles, this assessment includes\nconsideration of the views of independent risk\nmanagement and Internal Audit, and is overseen\nby applicable management committees. For\nexecutive officers and select other members of\nsenior management, the ICRM program also\nincludes balancing features that account for\ncurrent and longer-term risk horizons. For\nthese employees, we provide a total annual\nincentive award that is variable and paid in\ncombination of cash and long-term incentives\nsubject to clawback and forfeiture provisions\nunder our enhanced Clawback and Forfeiture\nPolicy adopted in 2020, consideration of\nqualitative aspects of performance, and/or the\ndiscretionary ability to reduce payouts,\nincluding for risk management issues or\nfailures. The Compensation Discussion and\nAnalysisin this proxy statement provides\nfurther detail related to how we manage risk\nand hold our executive officers accountable in\nconnection with our incentive compensation\nprograms. We have continued to focus on risk\nmanagement as it relates to our performance\nmanagement and incentive compensation\nprograms, including increased oversight from a\ngovernance perspective. Management has\nestablished performance management and\ncompensation steering committees for each\nbusiness group and enterprise function, as\nwell as the enterprise level. These committees\noversee the risk elements in the broad-based\nincentive compensation arrangements as a key\npart of governance for our ICRM program.\nEnhancements during 2020 include the formation\nand implementation of these management\nsteering committees at the business group and\nenterprise function level. The charter and\nresponsibilities of these committees was also\nexpanded to include oversight of the risk\nelements of performance management programs in\naddition to compensation programs. As part of\nthe heightened oversight of certain Identified\nRoles, accountability impacts for specific key\nrisk issues are incorporated into the\nassessment of risk management performance as\npart of annual performance reviews. The Board\noversees the ICRM program and the Company\u0092s\nother performance management and incentive\ncompensation programs, which are designed to\ndrive accountability and promote and\nincentivize the right behaviors. The Board has\ndelegated primary oversight of human capital\nmanagement, performance management, and the\nICRM program to its Human Resources Committee.\nThe Human Resources Committee receives\nperiodic reports from management, its\nindependent compensation consultant, and other\nadvisors to enable it to assess whether the\noverall design and execution of the Company\u0092s\nperformance management and incentive\ncompensation programs and decisions are\nconsistent with the Company\u0092s Risk Management\nFramework and promote risk accountability.\nThis reporting includes information on the\nCompany\u0092s culture, Code of Ethics, the results\nof regular audits of compliance with\ncompensation-related policies and controls,\nand human capital risk. For the 2020\nperformance year, management conducted a\nhorizontal review of key risk issues,\naccountability for them, and the results of\nthat review and recommended compensation\nimpacts were reported to the Human Resources\nCommittee to inform final compensation\ndecisions. The Company\u0092s Clawback and\nForfeiture Policy, which was adopted by the\nHuman Resources Committee in 2020, expands the\nindividuals and types of incentive\ncompensation awards subject to clawback or\nforfeiture and significantly strengthens the\nCompany\u0092s ability to hold executives and other\nemployees accountable for misconduct or risk\nevents through forfeiture or recovery of\ncompensation under appropriate circumstances,\nas described in the Compensation Discussion\nand Analysisin this proxy statement. In\naddition to our efforts to continue to\nstrengthen our ICRM program and practices and\nconsistent with our commitment to\ntransparency, we have enhanced and expanded\nour proxy disclosure each year since 2017. We\nhave provided disclosure about ongoing\nenhancements to our ICRM program, its focus on\nall risk types and coverage of all employees\neligible for incentive compensation, and\nchanges to our compensation programs,\nincluding in response to the issues raised by\nthis proposal and similar proposals we\nreceived in prior years. We believe that our\nICRM program, combined with the year-over-year\nexpansion of disclosure in our proxy\nstatements regarding our performance\nmanagement and incentive compensation programs\nand ongoing Board oversight of those programs,\nare responsive to the incentive compensation\nrisk concerns raised in this proposal without\nproviding an extensive level of detail that\nmight be sensitive for competitive, privacy,\nand other reasons.

Input from civil rights\norganizations, employees, and customers\nshould be considered in determining the\nspecific matters to be analyzed. A report on\nthe audit, prepared at reasonable cost and\nomitting confidential or proprietary\ninformation, should be publicly disclosed on\nWFC\u0092s website. SUPPORTING STATEMENT High-\nprofile police killings of black people \u0096\nmost recently George Floyd \u0096 have galvanized\nthe movement for racial justice. That\nmovement, together with the disproportionate\nimpacts of the COVID-19pandemic have focused\nthe attention of the media, the public and\npolicy makers on systemic racism, racialized\nviolence and inequities in employment, health\ncare, and the criminal justice system. In\nJune 2020, WFC CEO Charles Scharf urged that\n\u0093the inequality and discrimination that has\nbeen so clearly exposed . . . must not\ncontinue,\u0094 and WFC announced initiatives to\nimprove workforce diversity and inclusion and\ninvest in black-owned businesses. 12Those\nactions followed some missteps: Scharf\u0092s\nstatement that he appointed white men to top\njobs after arriving at WFC because of \u0093a very\nlimited pool of Black talent,\u0094 demoralizing\nblack employees, and the loss of black female\ntop managers. 13 WFC\u0092s problems predate\nScharf\u0092s 2019 arrival. WFC has settled\nemployment discrimination claims on several\nrecent occasions, including incidents of race\ndiscrimination in 2014 uncovered through a\nLabor Department audit. The Ninth Circuit\nrecently allowed a lawsuit brought by the\nCity of Oakland to proceed; it sued to\nrecover property tax revenues lost due to\nforeclosures on \u0093predatory loans,\u0094 which WFC\nmade more than twice as often to black and\nLatino borrowers. 14A similar lawsuit by the\nCity of Philadelphia was settled in 2019. In\n2012, the same discriminatory lending\npractices were the subject of a $184 million\nDepartment of Justice settlement. WFC\u0092s\nactivities with potential adverse impacts are\nnot limited to the employment and lending\ncontexts. WFC has donated to police\nfoundations in Sacramento, Houston, Los\nAngeles, and Seattle, which bypass normal\nprocurement processes to buy equipment for\npolice departments, including surveillance\ntechnology that has been used to target\ncommunities of color and nonviolent\nprotestors. WFC recently \u0093paused\u0094 such\ndonations after being targeted by Color of\nChange. WFC\u0092s political contributions are not\nfully aligned with its public statements: WFC\nhas donated to Senator Tom Cotton, who called\nfor military air strikes on Black Lives\nMatter protests, as well as other members of\nCongress with racist records. A racial equity\naudit would help WFC identify, prioritize,\nremedy and avoid adverse impacts on nonwhite\nstakeholders and communities of color. We are\nencouraged by Scharf\u0092s recent acknowledgment\nthat his statements about the black talent\npipeline reflected his own unconscious bias,\nand we urge WFC to assess its behavior\nthrough a racial equity lens in order to\nobtain a complete picture of how it\ncontributes to, and could help dismantle,\nsystemic racism. Position of the Board Our\nBoard recommends a vote AGAINST this\nproposal, which is identified as Item 7 on\nthe proxy card, for the following reasons:\n                                              \n      Wells Fargo is currently conducting a   \n      Human Rights Impact Assessment, which   \n      includes a specific focus on racial     \n      equity                                  \n      and is being overseen by the Board\u0092s     \n      Corporate Responsibility Committee, to  \n      assess and determine the Company\u0092s       \n      human rights risks.

The requirements described\nabove are separate from the procedures you\nmust follow to recommend a nominee for\nconsideration by the Governance and Nominating\nCommittee for election as a director as\ndescribed under Director Election Standard and\nNomination Processand from the requirements\nthat a shareholder must meet in order to have\na shareholder proposal pursuant to SEC Rule\n14a-8or a proxy access director nominee under\nour By-Lawsincluded in our proxy statement.\n                                \n  128    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nVoting and Other Meeting Information Other\nInformation Cost of Soliciting Proxies We pay\nthe cost of soliciting proxies. We have\nretained D.F. King & Co., Inc. to help the\nBoard solicit proxies. We expect to pay\napproximately $35,000 plus out-of-\npocketexpenses for its help. Members of the\nBoard and our employees may also solicit\nproxies for us by mail, telephone, fax,\ne-mail,or in person. We will not pay our\ndirectors or employees any extra amounts for\nsoliciting proxies. We may, upon request,\nreimburse brokerage firms, banks, or similar\nentities representing street name holders for\ntheir expenses in forwarding the notice of\ninternet availability of proxy materials\nand/or proxy materials to their customers who\nare street name holders and obtaining their\nvoting instructions. Electronic Delivery of\nProxy Materials We use the SEC notice and\naccess rule that allows us to furnish our\nproxy materials to our shareholders over the\ninternet instead of mailing paper copies of\nthose materials. As a result, beginning on or\nabout March 16, 2021, we sent to most of our\nshareholders by mail a notice of internet\navailability of proxy materials containing\ninstructions on how to access our proxy\nmaterials over the internet and vote online.\nThis notice is not a proxy card and cannot be\nused to vote your shares. If you received only\na notice, you will not receive paper copies of\nthe proxy materials unless you request the\nmaterials by following the instructions on the\nnotice or on the website referred to on the\nnotice. We provided some of our shareholders,\nincluding shareholders who have previously\nrequested to receive paper copies of the proxy\nmaterials and some of our shareholders who are\nparticipants in our benefit plans, with paper\ncopies of the proxy materials instead of a\nnotice that the materials are electronically\navailable over the internet. If you received\npaper copies of the proxy materials, we\nencourage you to help us save money and reduce\nthe environmental impact of delivering paper\nproxy materials to shareholders by signing up\nto receive all of your future proxy materials\nelectronically, as described below. If you own\nshares of common stock in more than one\naccount\u0097for example, in a joint account with\nyour spouse and in your individual brokerage\naccount\u0097you may have received more than one\nnotice or more than one set of paper proxy\nmaterials. To vote all of your shares by\nproxy, please follow each of the separate\nproxy voting instructions that you received\nfor your shares of common stock held in each\nof your different accounts. How to Receive\nFuture Proxy Materials Electronically\nShareholders can sign up to receive proxy\nmaterials electronically, and will receive an\ne-mailprior to next year\u0092s annual meeting with\nlinks to the proxy materials, which may give\nthem faster delivery of the materials and will\nhelp us save printing and mailing costs and\nconserve natural resources. Your election to\nreceive proxy materials by e-mailwill remain\nin effect until you terminate your election.\nTo receive proxy materials by e-mailin the\nfuture, you may either go to www.proxyvote.com\nand follow the instructions to enroll for\nelectronic delivery or follow the instructions\non the notice, or if a street name holder,\ncontact your brokerage firm, bank, or other\nsimilar entity that holds your shares. If you\nhave previously agreed to electronic delivery\nof our proxy materials, but wish to receive\npaper copies of these materials for the annual\nmeeting or for future meetings, please follow\nthe instructions on the website referred to on\nthe electronic notice you received.\nHouseholding SEC rules allow a single copy of\nthe proxy materials or the notice of internet\navailability of proxy materials to be\ndelivered to multiple shareholders sharing the\nsame address and last name, or who we\nreasonably believe are members of the same\nfamily and who consent to receiving a single\ncopy of these materials in a manner provided\nby these rules. This practice is referred to\nas \u0093householding\u0094 and can result in\nsignificant savings of paper and mailing\ncosts. Because we are using the SEC\u0092s notice\nand access rule, we will not household our\nproxy materials or notices to shareholders of\nrecord sharing an address. This means that\nshareholders of record who share an address\nwill each be mailed a separate notice or paper\ncopy of the proxy materials. However, we\nunderstand that certain brokerage firms,\nbanks, or other similar entities holding our\ncommon stock for their customers may household\nproxy materials or notices.\n                               \n  2021 Proxy Statement    129  \n                               \nVoting and Other Meeting Information\nShareholders sharing an address whose shares\nof our common stock are held by such an entity\nshould contact such entity if they now receive\n(1) multiple copies of our proxy materials or\nnotices and wish to receive only one copy of\nthese materials per household in the future,\nor (2) a single copy of our proxy materials or\nnotice and wish to receive separate copies of\nthese materials in the future.
