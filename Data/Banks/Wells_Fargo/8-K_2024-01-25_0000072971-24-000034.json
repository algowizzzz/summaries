Scharf\u2019s total compensation of $29 million for performance year\n2023. The design of our executive compensation program, including Mr.\nScharf\u2019s compensation target, remains unchanged from 2022.\n\nIn reaching this decision, the Board noted Mr. Scharf\u2019s strong leadership in:\n\n\u2022 Improving the financial performance of the company including driving\nincreased efficiency and capital return to shareholders\n\n\u2022 Bringing sustained focus to strengthening the company\u2019s risk and control\ninfrastructure, with significant progress over the past year\n\n\u2022 Enabling Wells Fargo to be a source of strength during the 2023 regional\nbanking crisis\n\n\u2022 Continuing to invest in the communities we serve\n\n\u2022 Investing in our businesses to drive growth and higher returns through a\nnumber of key initiatives. Examples include:\n\n\u25e6 Investing in digital platforms in both consumer and wholesale businesses\n\n\u25e6 Introducing two new credit cards to serve our consumers\u2019 needs\n\n\u25e6 Reducing the size and complexity of our Home Lending business\n\n\u25e6 Increasing market shares in investment banking and trading activities\n\n\u25e6 Beginning a new strategic private credit partnership to provide\nalternatives to Commercial Banking customers\n\nSimilar to last year, prior to the Human Resources Committee of the Board\n(the \u201cHRC\u201d) reaching its recommendation, Mr. Scharf discussed with the Chair\nof the HRC and asked the HRC to exercise negative discretion. Despite the\nimproved performance of the Company and the significant progress made, Mr.\nScharf continues to believe negative discretion is appropriate to emphasize\nthat more work remains ahead.\n\nThe HRC agreed and recommended to the Board total compensation of $29\nmillion, which is lower than the $30.3 million that would have otherwise been\ndelivered under the executive compensation program. The Board approved the\nrecommendation.\n\nMr. Scharf\u2019s 2023 total compensation is flat to what it would have been for\nperformance year 2022 if the HRC had not exercised negative discretion in\nrespect of that year.\n\nMr. Scharf\u2019s total compensation for 2023 consists of a base salary of $2.5\nmillion, unchanged since he joined the Company, and total variable\ncompensation of $26.5 million, which is comprised of $6.6 million in cash and\n$19.9 million in long-term equity, including 65% in Performance Share awards\n(PSA) and 35% in Restricted Share Rights (RSR) awards.\n\nThe Board expressed strong confidence in Mr. Scharf\u2019s leadership in driving\nthe continued transformation of Wells Fargo. They recognized his clear\ncommitment to delivering on behalf of the Company\u2019s shareholders, customers,\nemployees, and other stakeholders.\n\nAdditional important information about the HRC\u2019s oversight of the Company\u2019s\ngovernance and executive compensation philosophy, policies, and practices for\nMr. Scharf and the other named executive officers, will be presented in our\nproxy statement for the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, to be filed with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission.\n                                                                             \n                                  SIGNATURE                                  \n                                                                             \nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the\nregistrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the\nundersigned hereunto duly authorized.\n                                                                             \n                                WELLS FARGO &                                \n  Dated:    January 25, 2024    COMPANY                                      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                By:              /s/ EMMA M.
