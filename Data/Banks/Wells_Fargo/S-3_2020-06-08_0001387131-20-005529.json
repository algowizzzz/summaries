The\nprospectus supplement will describe the\nspecific terms of the debt securities offered\nthrough that prospectus supplement and any\ngeneral terms outlined in this section that\nwill not apply to those debt securities.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, our debt securities\nwill be issued under an indenture dated as of\nFebruary 21, 2017 between us and\nCitibank, N.A., as trustee, referred to in\nthis \u201cDescription of Debt Securities of Wells\nFargo & Company\u201d\nsection as the \u201c.\u201d We have summarized the\nmaterial terms and provisions of the indenture\nin this section.\nWe have also filed the indenture as an exhibit\nto the registration statement of which this\nprospectus is a part. You should read\nthe indenture for additional information\nbefore you buy any debt securities.

The\nindenture does not limit the amount\nof debt securities that we may issue. Holders\nof the debt securities may be fully\nsubordinated to interests held by the U.S.\ngovernment in the event we enter into a\nreceivership, insolvency, liquidation or\nsimilar proceeding.\n\nThe debt securities are our unsecured senior\ndebt securities, but our assets consist\nprimarily of equity in our subsidiaries. We\nare a separate and distinct legal entity from\nour subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to\nmake payments on our debt securities depends\non our receipt of dividends, loan payments\nand other funds from our subsidiaries. Various\nfederal and state statutes and regulations\nlimit the amount of dividends that our\nbanking and other subsidiaries may pay us\nwithout regulatory approval. In addition, if\nany of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent,\nthe direct creditors of that subsidiary will\nhave a prior claim on its assets. Our rights\nand the rights of our creditors, including\nyour rights as an owner of our debt\nsecurities, will be subject to that prior\nclaim, unless we are also a direct creditor of\nthat\nsubsidiary. This subordination of creditors of\na parent company to prior claims of creditors\nof its subsidiaries is commonly referred\nto as structural subordination.\n\nNew York State law governs the indenture\nunder which the debt securities will be\nissued. New York has usury laws that limit the\namount of interest that can be charged and\npaid on loans, which includes debt securities.\nUnder present New York usury law, the maximum\npermissible rate of interest, subject\nto some exceptions, is 16% per annum on a\nsimple interest basis for debt securities in\nwhich less than $250,000 has been invested\nand 25% per annum on a simple interest basis\nfor debt securities in which $250,000 or more\nhas been invested. This limit may\nnot apply to debt securities in which\n$2,500,000 or more has been invested. We\nagree, to the extent permitted by law, not to\nvoluntarily\nclaim the benefits of any such usury laws in\nconnection with the debt securities.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, we may, from time to\ntime, without the consent of the holders of a\nseries of debt securities, issue additional\ndebt securities of that series having the same\nterms as previously issued debt securities of\nthat series (other than the issue\ndate, the date, if any, that interest begins\nto accrue and the price to public, which may\nvary). Any such additional debt securities,\ntogether with the initial debt securities,\nwill constitute a single series of debt\nsecurities under the indenture. No additional\ndebt securities of a series may be issued if\nan event of default under the indenture has\noccurred and is continuing with respect\nto that series of debt securities.\n                      7                       \nA prospectus supplement relating to a series\nof debt securities being offered will include\nspecific terms relating to the offering.\n(Section 301) These terms will include some\nor all of the following:\n                                              \n  \u25cf  the title and type of the debt           \n     securities;

(Section 602)\n\nOther than its duties in the case of a\ncovenant\nbreach or an event of default, the trustee is\nnot obligated to exercise any of its rights or\npowers under the indenture at the\nrequest, order or direction of any holders,\nunless the holders offer the trustee\nindemnification. (Sections 601, 603) If\nindemnification\nis provided, then, subject to other rights of\nthe trustee, the holders of a majority in\nprincipal amount of the outstanding debt\nsecurities of any series may, with respect to\nthe debt securities of that series, direct the\ntime, method and place of:\n                                              \n  \u25cf  conducting any proceeding for any        \n     remedy available to the trustee; or      \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25cf  exercising any trust or power conferred  \n     upon the trustee.

The\nprospectus supplement will describe the\nspecific terms of the debt securities offered\nthrough that prospectus supplement and any\ngeneral terms outlined in this section that\nwill not apply to those debt securities.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, our debt securities\nwill be issued under an indenture dated as of\nApril 25, 2018 among us, as issuer,\nWells Fargo & Company, as Guarantor, and\nCitibank, N.A., as trustee, referred to in\nthis \u201cDescription of Debt Securities\nof Wells Fargo Finance LLC\u201d section as the \u201c.\u201d\nWe have summarized the material terms and\nprovisions\nof the indenture in this section. We have also\nfiled the indenture as an exhibit to the\nregistration statement of which this\nprospectus\nis a part. You should read the indenture for\nadditional information before you buy any debt\nsecurities. The summary that follows\nincludes references to section numbers of the\nindenture so that you can more easily locate\nthese provisions.\n\nA prospectus supplement to this prospectus\nmay relate to a series of medium-term notes,\nestablished as a series of debt securities\nunder the indenture. In that event, references\nherein to terms and conditions of debt\nsecurities being provided in the \u201capplicable\nprospectus supplement\u201d may be provided\nin the applicable prospectus supplement,\napplicable product supplement and/or\napplicable pricing supplement for such debt\nsecurities.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe debt securities will be our direct\nunsecured\nobligations and will rank equally with all of\nour other unsecured unsubordinated debt.\nPayment on the debt securities is fully\nand unconditionally guaranteed by Wells Fargo\n& Company, as Guarantor. The indenture does\nnot limit the amount of debt\nsecurities that we may issue.\n\nThe assets of the Guarantor consist primarily\nof equity in its subsidiaries, and the\nGuarantor is a separate and distinct legal\nentity from its subsidiaries. As a result, the\nGuarantor\u2019s ability to address claims of\nholders of our debt securities against the\nGuarantor under the guarantee depends\non its receipt of dividends, loan payments and\nother funds from its subsidiaries. Various\nfederal and state statutes and regulations\nlimit the amount of dividends that banking and\nother subsidiaries may pay to the Guarantor\nwithout regulatory approval. In addition,\nif any of the Guarantor\u2019s subsidiaries becomes\ninsolvent, the direct creditors of that\nsubsidiary will have a prior claim\non its assets. The rights of the Guarantor and\nthe rights of its creditors will be subject to\nthat prior claim unless the Guarantor\nis also a direct creditor of that subsidiary.\nThis subordination of creditors of a parent\ncompany to prior claims of creditors\nof its subsidiaries is commonly referred to as\nstructural subordination.\n\nHolders of our debt securities are our direct\ncreditors, as well as direct creditors of the\nGuarantor under the related guarantee. As a\nfinance subsidiary, we have no independent\noperations beyond the issuance and\nadministration of our securities and will have\nno independent assets available for\ndistributions\nto holders of our debt securities if they make\nclaims in respect of the debt securities in a\nbankruptcy, resolution or similar\nproceeding. Accordingly, any recoveries by\nsuch holders will be limited to those\navailable under the related guarantee by the\nGuarantor\nand that guarantee will rankpari passu with\nall other unsecured, unsubordinated\nobligations of the Guarantor.\nHolders of our debt securities should\naccordingly assume that in any such\nproceedings they would not have any priority\nover and\nshould be treatedpari passu with the claims of\nother unsecured, unsubordinated creditors of\nthe Guarantor, including\nholders of debt securities issued by the\nGuarantor.\n\nThe indenture does not contain restrictions\non our ability to:\n                                              \n  \u25cf  incur, assume or become liable for any   \n     type of debt or other obligation;        \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25cf  create liens on our property for any     \n     purpose; or                              \n                                              \n                      16                      \n                                              \n     pay dividends or make distributions on   \n  \u25cf  our capital stock or repurchase or       \n     redeem our capital stock.                \n                                              \nThe indenture does not require the maintenance\nof any financial ratios or specified levels of\nnet worth or liquidity. In addition, the\nindenture does not contain any provisions\nwhich would require us to repurchase or redeem\nor modify the terms of any of the debt\nsecurities upon a change of control or other\nevent involving us which may adversely affect\nthe creditworthiness of the debt securities.\n\nNew York State law governs the indenture\nunder which the debt securities will be\nissued. New York has usury laws that limit the\namount of interest that can be charged and\npaid on loans, which includes debt securities.\nUnder present New York usury law, the maximum\npermissible rate of interest, subject\nto some exceptions, is 16% per annum on a\nsimple interest basis for debt securities in\nwhich less than $250,000 has been invested\nand 25% per annum on a simple interest basis\nfor debt securities in which $250,000 or more\nhas been invested. This limit may\nnot apply to debt securities in which\n$2,500,000 or more has been invested. We\nagree, to the extent permitted by law, not to\nvoluntarily\nclaim the benefits of any such usury laws in\nconnection with the debt securities.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, we may, from time to\ntime, without the consent of the holders of a\nseries of debt securities, issue additional\ndebt securities of that series having the same\nterms as previously issued debt securities of\nthat series (other than the issue\ndate, the date, if any, that interest begins\nto accrue and the price to public, which may\nvary). Any such additional debt securities,\ntogether with the initial debt securities,\nwill constitute a single series of debt\nsecurities under the indenture. No additional\ndebt securities of a series may be issued if\nan event of default under the indenture has\noccurred and is continuing with respect\nto that series of debt securities.\n\nA prospectus supplement relating to a series\nof debt securities being offered will include\nspecific terms relating to the offering.\n(Section 301) These terms will include some\nor all of the following:\n                                              \n  \u25cf  the title and type of the debt           \n     securities;

Currently,\nfew facilities exist in the United States\nto convert U.S. dollars into foreign\ncurrencies and vice versa. In addition, most\nU.S. banks do not offer non-U.S. dollar\ndenominated\nchecking or savings account facilities.\nAccordingly, unless alternative arrangements\nare made, we will pay principal, premium,\nif any, and interest, if any, on debt\nsecurities that are payable in a foreign\ncurrency to an account at a bank outside the\nUnited\nStates, which, in the case of a debt security\npayable in euros, will be made by credit or\ntransfer to a euro account specified\nby the payee in a country for which the euro\nis the lawful currency.\n\nWhen we refer to the payment of \u201cprincipal\u201d\nin this prospectus in the context of the\namount payable at stated maturity or earlier\nredemption or repayment of a debt security\nwhose payment is linked to the performance of\na market measure, we are referring to the\namount payable on such debt security at\nstated maturity or earlier redemption or\nrepayment, as specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, other than any interest\npayable at such time. Such amount may be\ngreater than, equal to or less than the stated\nprincipal or face amount of such debt security\nat issuance.\n\nFixed Rate Debt Securities\n\nWe may issue fixed rate debt securities.\nEach fixed rate debt security will bear\ninterest from the date of issuance at the\nannual rate specified in the applicable\nprospectus\nsupplement until the principal is paid or made\navailable for payment.\n\nFloating Rate Debt Securities\n\nWe may issue floating rate debt securities\nthat bear interest at a floating rate\ndetermined by reference to a base rate\nspecified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement.\n\nRedemption and Repayment\n\nOptional Redemption By Us. If applicable,\nthe prospectus supplement will indicate the\nterms of our option to redeem the debt\nsecurities offered thereby.\n\nRepayment At Option Of Holder.

We may purchase debt\nsecurities at any price in the open market or\notherwise. Debt securities so purchased by us\nmay, at our discretion, be held or resold or\nsurrendered to the trustee for cancellation.\n\nPayment of Additional Amounts\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, we will not pay any\nadditional amounts on the debt securities\noffered thereby to compensate any beneficial\nowner for any United States tax withheld from\npayments on such debt securities.\n                      19                      \nDenominations\n\nUnless we state otherwise in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, the debt securities\nwill be issued only in registered form,\nwithout coupons, in denominations of $1,000\neach or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess\nthereof.\n\nThe Trustee\n\nFrom time to time, we and certain of our\naffiliates maintain deposit accounts and\nconduct other banking transactions, including\nlending transactions, with the trustee in\nthe ordinary course of business.\n\nNotices\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, any notices required to\nbe given to the holders of the debt securities\nin global form will be given to the\ndepositary.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe indenture is, and the debt securities\nwill be, governed by and will be construed in\naccordance with New York law.\n\nNo Listing\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, the debt securities\nwill not be listed or displayed on any\nsecurities exchange or automated quotation\nsystem.\n\nWells Fargo & Company Guarantee\n\nThe Guarantor will fully and unconditionally\nguarantee, on an unsecured basis, the full and\npunctual payment of the principal of, interest\non, and all other amounts payable\nunder the debt securities when the same\nbecomes due and payable, whether at maturity\nor upon redemption, repayment at the option\nof the holders of the applicable debt\nsecurities, upon acceleration or otherwise. If\nfor any reason we do not make any required\npayment in respect of our debt securities when\ndue, the Guarantor will on demand pay the\nunpaid amount at the same place and in\nthe same manner that applies to payments made\nby us under the indenture. The guarantee is of\npayment and not of collection.

(Section 1602)         \n                                              \nHolders of our debt securities are our direct\ncreditors, as well as direct creditors of the\nGuarantor under the related guarantee. As a\nfinance subsidiary, we have no independent\noperations beyond the issuance and\nadministration of our securities and will have\nno independent assets available for\ndistributions\nto holders of our debt securities if they make\nclaims in respect of the debt securities in a\nbankruptcy, resolution or similar\nproceeding. Accordingly, any recoveries by\nsuch holders will be limited to those\navailable under the related guarantee by the\nGuarantor\nand that guarantee will rankpari passu with\nall other unsecured, unsubordinated\nobligations of the Guarantor.\nHolders of our debt securities should\naccordingly assume that in any such\nproceedings they would not have any priority\nover and\nshould be treatedpari passu with the claims of\nother unsecured, unsubordinated creditors of\nthe Guarantor, including\nholders of debt securities issued by the\nGuarantor.\n                      20                      \nConsolidation, Merger or Sale\n\nThe indenture generally permits a\nconsolidation\nor merger between us and another entity and/or\nbetween the Guarantor and another entity.

If such a declaration occurs, the\nholders of a majority of the aggregate\nprincipal amount of the outstanding debt\nsecurities of that series can, subject to\nconditions, rescind the declaration. Unless\notherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus\nsupplement for a particular offering of debt\nsecurities, the holders of our debt securities\nwill not have the right to accelerate\nthe payment of principal of the debt\nsecurities as a result of a covenant breach or\nour failure to perform any covenant or\nagreement\ncontained in the debt securities or the\nindenture other than the obligations to pay\nprincipal and interest on the debt securities.\n(Sections 502, 513)\n                      23                      \nEvents of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership\nor liquidation relating to the Guarantor will\nnot constitute an event of default with\nrespect to any series of our debt securities.\nIn\naddition, failure by the Guarantor to perform\nany of its covenants or warranties (other than\na payment default) will not constitute\nan event of default with respect to any series\nof our debt securities. Therefore, events of\nbankruptcy, insolvency, receivership\nor liquidation relating to the Guarantor (in\nthe absence of any such event occurring with\nrespect to us) will not permit any of\nthe debt securities to be declared due and\npayable and the trustee is not authorized to\nexercise any remedy against us or the\nGuarantor\nupon the occurrence or continuation of these\nevents with respect to the Guarantor. Instead,\neven if an event of bankruptcy,\ninsolvency, receivership or liquidation\nrelating to the Guarantor has occurred, the\ntrustee and the holders of debt securities\nof a series will not be able to declare the\nrelevant debt securities to be immediately due\nand payable unless there is an event\nof default with respect to that series as\ndescribed above, such as our bankruptcy,\ninsolvency, receivership or liquidation or a\npayment default by us or the Guarantor on the\nrelevant debt securities.The value you receive\non any series of debt securities may be\nsignificantly less than what you would have\notherwise received had our debt securities\nbeen declared due and payable immediately or\nthe trustee been authorized to exercise any\nremedy against us or the Guarantor upon the\noccurrence or continuation of these events\nwith respect to the Guarantor.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, a \u201c,\u201d when used in the\nindenture with respect to any series of debt\nsecurities,\nmeans any of the following:\n                                              \n       failure to perform any covenant in     \n       the indenture that applies to debt     \n       securities of that series for 90 days  \n       after Wells Fargo                      \n  (1)  Finance LLC and the Guarantor have     \n       received written notice of the         \n       failure to perform in the manner       \n       specified in the indenture;            \n       or                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       any other covenant breach that may be  \n       specified for the debt securities of   \n  (2)  that series when that series is        \n       created.

(Section 1005). The\ntrustee may withhold notice to the\nholders of debt securities of any default,\nexcept defaults in the payment of principal,\npremium, interest or any sinking fund\ninstallment,\nif it considers the withholding of notice to\nbe in the best interests of the holders. For\npurposes of this paragraph, \u201c\u201d\nmeans any event which is, or after notice or\nlapse of time or both would become, a covenant\nbreach with respect to the debt securities\nof a series or an event of default under the\nindenture with respect to the debt securities\nof the applicable series.

The agents for the debt\nsecurities represented by a global security\nwill initially designate the accounts to\nbe credited. Payments by participants to\nowners of beneficial interests in a global\nsecurity will be governed by standing\ninstructions\nand customary practices, as is the case with\nsecurities held for customer accounts\nregistered in \u201cstreet name,\u201d and\nwill be the sole responsibility of those\nparticipants. Book-entry debt securities may\nbe more difficult to pledge because of the\nlack of a physical debt security.\n\nDTC\n\nSo long as DTC or its nominee is the\nregistered\nowner of a global security, DTC or its\nnominee, as the case may be, will be\nconsidered the sole owner and holder of the\ndebt securities\nrepresented by that global security for all\npurposes of the debt securities. Owners of\nbeneficial interests in the debt securities\nwill not be entitled to have debt securities\nregistered in their names, will not receive or\nbe entitled to receive physical delivery\nof the debt securities in definitive form and\nwill not be considered owners or holders of\ndebt securities under the indenture.\nAccordingly, each person owning a beneficial\ninterest in a global security must rely on the\nprocedures of DTC and, if that person\nis not a DTC participant, on the procedures of\nthe participant through which that person owns\nits interest, to exercise any rights\nof a holder of debt securities. The laws of\nsome jurisdictions require that certain\npurchasers of securities take physical\ndelivery\nof the securities in certificated form. These\nlaws may impair the ability to transfer\nbeneficial interests in a global security.\nBeneficial owners may experience delays in\nreceiving distributions on their debt\nsecurities since distributions will initially\nbe made to DTC and must then be transferred\nthrough the chain of intermediaries to the\nbeneficial owner\u2019s account.\n\nWe and Wells Fargo Finance LLC understand\nthat, under existing industry practices, if we\nor Wells Fargo Finance LLC, as applicable,\nrequest holders to take any action, or\nif an owner of a beneficial interest in a\nglobal security desires to take any action\nwhich a holder is entitled to take under the\nindenture, then DTC would authorize the\nparticipants holding the relevant beneficial\ninterests to take that action and those\nparticipants\nwould authorize the beneficial owners owning\nthrough such participants to take that action\nor would otherwise act upon the instructions\nof beneficial owners owning through them.\n\nBeneficial interests in a global security\nwill be shown on, and transfers of those\nownership interests will be effected only\nthrough, records maintained by DTC and its\nparticipants\nfor that global security. The conveyance of\nnotices and other communications by DTC to its\nparticipants and by its participants\nto owners of beneficial interests in the debt\nsecurities will be governed by arrangements\namong them, subject to any statutory\nor regulatory requirements in effect.\n\nDTC is a limited-purpose trust company\norganized\nunder the New York banking law, a \u201cbanking\norganization\u201d within the meaning of the New\nYork Banking Law, a member of\nthe Federal Reserve System, a \u201cclearing\ncorporation\u201d within the meaning of the New\nYork Uniform Commercial Code and\na \u201cclearing agency\u201d registered under the\nExchange Act.\n\nDTC holds the securities of its participants\nand facilitates the clearance and settlement\nof securities transactions among its\nparticipants in such securities through\nelectronic\nbook-entry changes in accounts of its\nparticipants.

Clearstream interfaces with\ndomestic securities markets in several\ncountries.

Euroclear is operated by Euroclear\nBank S.A./N.V., or the \u201c,\u201d under contract with\nEuroclear plc, a U.K. corporation. All\noperations\nare conducted by the Euroclear Operator, and\nall Euroclear securities clearance accounts\nand Euroclear cash accounts are accounts\nwith the Euroclear Operator, not Euroclear\nplc.

Secondary market\ntrading between DTC participants will occur in\nthe ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules\nand will be settled in immediately\navailable funds using DTC\u2019s Same-Day Funds\nSettlement System. Secondary market trading\nbetween Clearstream Participants and/or\nEuroclear Participants will occur in the\nordinary way in accordance with the applicable\nrules and operating procedures of Clearstream\nand Euroclear and will be settled using the\nprocedures applicable to conventional\neurobonds in immediately available funds.\n\nCross-market transfers between persons holding\ndirectly or indirectly through DTC, on the one\nhand, and directly or indirectly through\nClearstream Participants or Euroclear\nParticipants,\non the other, will be effected through DTC in\naccordance with DTC rules on behalf of the\nrelevant European international clearing\nsystem by its U.S. Depositary; however, such\ncross-market transactions will require\ndelivery of instructions to the relevant\nEuropean\ninternational clearing system by the\ncounterparty in such system in accordance with\nits rules and procedures and within its\nestablished\ndeadlines (European time). The relevant\nEuropean international clearing system will,\nif the transaction meets its settlement\nrequirements,\ndeliver instructions to its U.S. Depositary to\ntake action to effect final settlement on its\nbehalf by delivering or receiving\ndebt securities through DTC, and making or\nreceiving payment in accordance with normal\nprocedures for same-day funds settlement\napplicable to DTC. Clearstream Participants\nand Euroclear Participants may not deliver\ninstructions directly to their respective\nU.S. Depositaries.\n\nBecause of time-zone differences, credits\nof debt securities received through\nClearstream or Euroclear as a result of a\ntransaction with a DTC participant will be\nmade during\nsubsequent securities settlement processing\nand dated the business day following the DTC\nsettlement date. Such credits or any\ntransactions\nin such debt securities settled during such\nprocessing will be reported to the relevant\nEuroclear Participants or Clearstream\nParticipants\non such business day. Cash received in\nClearstream or Euroclear as a result of sales\nof debt securities by or through a Clearstream\nParticipant or a Euroclear Participant to a\nDTC participant will be received with value on\nthe DTC settlement date but will be\navailable in the relevant Clearstream or\nEuroclear cash account only as of the business\nday following settlement in DTC. Unless\notherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, a \u201c\u201d means any day,\nother than a Saturday\nor Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor\na day on which banking institutions are\nauthorized or required by law or regulation\nto close in New York, New York.\n\nIf the debt securities are cleared only\nthrough Euroclear and Clearstream (and not\nDTC), you will be able to make and receive\nthrough Euroclear and Clearstream payments,\ndeliveries, transfers, exchanges, notices, and\nother transactions involving any securities\nheld through those systems only on days\nwhen those systems are open for business.\nThose systems may not be open for business on\ndays when banks, brokers, and other\ninstitutions\nare open for business in the United States. In\naddition, because of time-zone differences,\nU.S. investors who hold their interests\nin the securities through these systems and\nwish to transfer their interests, or to\nreceive or make a payment or delivery or\nexercise\nany other right with respect to their\ninterests, on a particular day may find that\nthe transaction will not be effected until the\nnext business day in Luxembourg or Brussels,\nas applicable. Thus, U.S. investors who wish\nto exercise rights that expire on a particular\nday may need to act before the expiration\ndate.\n\nAlthough DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear\nhave agreed to the foregoing procedures in\norder to facilitate transfers of debt\nsecurities among participants of DTC,\nClearstream\nand Euroclear, they are under no obligation to\nperform or continue to perform such procedures\nand such procedures may be modified\nor discontinued at any time.\n                      29                      \nNone of Wells Fargo & Company, Wells Fargo\nFinance LLC nor any paying agent will have any\nresponsibility for the performance by DTC,\nEuroclear or Clearstream or their respective\ndirect or indirect participants of their\nobligations under the rules and procedures\ngoverning their operations.\n                      30                      \n                                              \n   DESCRIPTION OF WARRANTS OF WELLS FARGO &   \n                   COMPANY                    \nIn this \u201cDescription of Warrants of\nWells Fargo & Company\u201d section, all references\nto \u201cwarrants\u201d refer only to warrants issued by\nWells\nFargo & Company and not to any warrants issued\nby any subsidiary or affiliate.\n\nThis section describes the general terms\nand provisions of our warrants.

The unit\nagent will not so apply such principal\npayments if the holder has delivered cash to\nmeet its obligations under the purchase\ncontract. To settle the purchase contract\nand receive the purchase contract property,\nthe holder must present and surrender the unit\ncertificates at the office of the unit\nagent. If a holder settles its obligations\nunder a purchase contract that is part of a\nunit in cash rather than by delivering the\ndebt security that is part of the unit, that\ndebt security will remain outstanding if the\nmaturity extends beyond the relevant\nsettlement date and, as more fully described\nin the applicable prospectus supplement, the\nholder will receive that debt security\nor an interest in the relevant global\nsecurity.\n\n. To secure the obligations of the purchase\ncontract holders contained in the purchase\ncontracts that are\nissued as part of a unit and in the unit\nagreement, the holders, acting through the\nunit agent, as their attorney-in-fact, will\nassign and pledge the items in the following\nsentence (the \u201c\u201d) to a bank or trust company\nselected by\nus, in its capacity as collateral agent, for\nour benefit.

The\ncollateral agent will forward all payments\nfrom the pledged items to us, unless such\npayments have been released from the pledge\nin accordance with the unit agreement. We will\nuse the payments received from the pledged\nitems to satisfy the obligations of the\nholder of the unit under the related purchase\ncontract.\n\nProperty Held in Trust by Unit Agent.\nIf a holder fails to settle in cash its\nobligations under a purchase contract that is\npart of a unit and fails to present and\nsurrender\nits unit certificate to the unit agent when\nrequired, that holder will not receive the\npurchase contract property. Instead, the\nunit agent will hold that holder\u2019s purchase\ncontract property, together with any\ndistributions, as the registered owner in\ntrust for the benefit of the holder until the\nholder presents and surrenders the certificate\nor provides satisfactory evidence\nthat the certificate has been destroyed, lost\nor stolen. We or the unit agent may require an\nindemnity from the holder for liabilities\nrelated to any destroyed, lost or stolen\ncertificate. If the holder does not present\nthe unit certificate, or provide the necessary\nevidence of destruction or loss and indemnity,\non or before the second anniversary of the\nsettlement date of the related purchase\ncontract, the unit agent will pay to us the\namounts it received in trust for that holder.\nThereafter, the holder may recover those\namounts only from us and not the unit agent.\nThe unit agent will have no obligation to\ninvest or to pay interest on any amounts\nit holds in trust pending distribution.\n\nTitle.

If a holder settles its obligations\nunder a purchase contract that is part of a\nunit in cash rather than by delivering the\ndebt security that is part of the unit, that\ndebt security will remain outstanding if the\nmaturity extends beyond the relevant\nsettlement date and, as more fully described\nin the applicable prospectus supplement, the\nholder will receive that debt security\nor an interest in the relevant global\nsecurity.\n\nPledge by Purchase Contract Holders to Secure\nPerformance. To secure the obligations of the\npurchase contract holders contained in the\npurchase contracts that are\nissued as part of a unit and in the unit\nagreement, the holders, acting through the\nunit agent, as their attorney-in-fact, will\nassign and pledge the items in the following\nsentence to a bank or trust company selected\nby us, in its capacity as collateral\nagent, for our benefit. The pledge is a\nsecurity interest in, and a lien upon and\nright of set-off against, all of the holders\u2019\nright, title and interest in and to:\n                         \n  \u25cf  the pledged items;  \n                         \n                      57                      \n                                              \n     all additions to and substitutions for   \n     the pledged items as may be              \n  \u25cf  permissible, if so specified in the      \n     applicable prospectus                    \n     supplement;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n     all income, proceeds and collections     \n     received or to be received, or derived   \n  \u25cf  or to be derived, at any time from or    \n     in connection                            \n     with the pledged items described in the  \n     two clauses above; and                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     all powers and rights owned or           \n  \u25cf  thereafter acquired under or with        \n     respect to the pledged items.            \n                                              \nThe pledge constitutes collateral security\nfor the performance when due by each holder of\nits obligations under the unit agreement and\nthe applicable purchase contract. The\ncollateral agent will forward all payments\nfrom the pledged items to us, unless such\npayments have been released from the pledge\nin accordance with the unit agreement. We will\nuse the payments received from the pledged\nitems to satisfy the obligations of the\nholder of the unit under the related purchase\ncontract.\n\nProperty Held in Trust by Unit Agent.\nIf a holder fails to settle in cash its\nobligations under a purchase contract that is\npart of a unit and fails to present and\nsurrender\nits unit certificate to the unit agent when\nrequired, that holder will not receive the\npurchase contract property. Instead, the\nunit agent will hold that holder\u2019s purchase\ncontract property, together with any\ndistributions, as the registered owner in\ntrust for the benefit of the holder until the\nholder presents and surrenders the certificate\nor provides satisfactory evidence\nthat the certificate has been destroyed, lost\nor stolen. We or the unit agent may require an\nindemnity from the holder for liabilities\nrelated to any destroyed, lost or stolen\ncertificate. If the holder does not present\nthe unit certificate, or provide the necessary\nevidence of destruction or loss and indemnity,\non or before the second anniversary of the\nsettlement date of the related purchase\ncontract, the unit agent will pay to us the\namounts it received in trust for that holder.\nThereafter, the holder may recover those\namounts only from us and not the unit agent.\nThe unit agent will have no obligation to\ninvest or to pay interest on any amounts\nit holds in trust pending distribution.\n\nTitle. We, the Guarantor, the unit\nagent, the trustee, the warrant agent and any\nof our or their agents will treat the\nregistered holder of any purchase contract\nas the owner, notwithstanding any notice to\nthe contrary, for all purposes.\n\nPayment of Additional Amounts\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, neither we nor the\nGuarantor will pay any additional amounts on\nthe purchase contracts offered thereby\nto compensate any beneficial owner for any\nUnited States tax withheld from payments on\nsuch purchase contracts.\n                      58                      \n                                              \n      PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF      \n                  INTEREST)                   \nWe are offering our securities and Wells\nFargo Finance LLC is offering its securities\nfully and unconditionally guaranteed by us on\na continuing basis through Wells Fargo\nSecurities, LLC and through any additional\nagents named in the applicable pricing\nsupplement (individually an \u201c\u201d\nand collectively the \u201c\u201d) who have agreed to\nuse their reasonable efforts to solicit\npurchases of the securities.\nWe or Wells Fargo Finance LLC, as applicable,\nwill have the sole right to accept offers to\npurchase the securities, and we or Wells\nFargo Finance LLC, as applicable, may reject\nany offer in whole or in part. Each agent may\nreject, in whole or in part, any offer\nit solicited to purchase securities. We or\nWells Fargo Finance LLC, as applicable, will\npay an agent, in connection with sales\nof these securities resulting from a\nsolicitation that such agent made or an offer\nto purchase that such agent received, a\ncommission\nin an amount agreed upon at the time of sale.\nSuch commission will be set forth in the\napplicable pricing supplement. The discount\nor commission that may be received by any\nmember of FINRA for any sales of securities\npursuant to this prospectus, together with\nthe reimbursement of any counsel fees by us\nand/or Wells Fargo Finance LLC, will not\nexceed 8.00% of the initial gross proceeds\nfrom the sale of any securities being sold.\nAny agreement that we enter into with agents\nwill contain, to the extent required,\ncontractual provisions required to comply with\nthe \u201cRestrictions on Qualified Financial\nContracts of Systemically Important\nU.S. Banking Organizations and the U.S.\nOperations of Systemically Important Foreign\nBanking Organizations; Revisions to the\nDefinition\nof Qualifying Master Netting Agreement and\nRelated Definitions\u201d as issued by the FRB, the\nFDIC and the OCC and other applicable\nlaw.\n\nWe and Wells Fargo Finance LLC may also\nsell the securities to an agent as principal\nfor its own account at a discount to be agreed\nupon at the time of sale. Such discount\nwill be set forth in the applicable pricing\nsupplement. That agent may resell the\nsecurities to investors and other purchasers\nat a fixed offering price or at prevailing\nmarket prices, or prices related thereto at\nthe time of resale or otherwise, as that\nagent determines and as we or Wells Fargo\nFinance LLC, as applicable, will specify in\nthe applicable pricing supplement. Unless\nthe applicable pricing supplement states\notherwise, any securities sold to agents as\nprincipal will be purchased at a price equal\nto 100% of the principal amount less the\nagreed upon discount. An agent may offer the\nsecurities it has purchased as principal\nto other dealers. The agent may sell the\nsecurities to any dealer at a discount and,\nunless otherwise specified in the applicable\npricing supplement, the discount allowed to\nany other dealer will not be in excess of the\ndiscount that the agent will receive\nfrom us or Wells Fargo Finance LLC, as\napplicable. After the initial public offering\nof securities that an agent is to resell on\na fixed public offering price basis, the agent\nmay change the public offering price and\ndiscount.\n\nWe and Wells Fargo Finance LLC may arrange\nfor securities to be sold through agents or\nmay sell securities directly to investors on\nour or Wells Fargo Finance LLC\u2019s,\nas applicable, own behalf or through an\naffiliate. No commissions will be paid on\nsecurities sold directly by us or Wells Fargo\nFinance LLC. We or Wells Fargo Finance LLC, as\napplicable, may accept offers to purchase\nsecurities through additional agents and\nmay appoint additional agents to solicit\noffers to purchase securities. Any other\nagents will be named in the applicable pricing\nsupplement.\n\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, one of our\nwholly-owned subsidiaries and an affiliate of\nWells Fargo Finance LLC, will comply with Rule\n5121 of the Conduct Rules of\nFINRA in connection with each placement of the\nsecurities in which it participates. If Wells\nFargo Securities, LLC or one of our\nother wholly-owned subsidiaries or affiliated\nentities participates in a sale of the\nsecurities, such subsidiary or entity will\nnot confirm sales to accounts over which they\nexercise discretionary authority without the\nprior specific written approval of the\ncustomer in accordance with Rule 5121.\n\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo\nAdvisors (the trade name of the retail\nbrokerage business of Wells Fargo Clearing\nServices, LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors\nFinancial\nNetwork, LLC) or another of our and Wells\nFargo Finance LLC\u2019s affiliates may use the\napplicable pricing supplement, the applicable\nprospectus supplement and any related product\nsupplement and/or other supplement and this\nprospectus for offers and sales related\nto market-making transactions in the\nsecurities. Such entities may act as principal\nor agent in these transactions, and the sales\nwill be made at prices related to prevailing\nmarket prices at the time of sale.\n\nEach of the agents may be deemed to be an\n\u201cunderwriter\u201d within the meaning of the\nSecurities Act. We and Wells Fargo Finance LLC\nand the agents have agreed to\nindemnify each other against certain\nliabilities, including\n                      59                      \nliabilities under the Securities Act, or to\ncontribute to payments\nmade in respect of those liabilities. We and\nWells Fargo Finance LLC have also agreed to\nreimburse the agents for specified expenses.\n\nWe and Wells Fargo Finance LLC estimate\nthat we and Wells Fargo Finance LLC will spend\napproximately $16,237,400 for legal fees,\nprinting fees, trustee fees, CUSIP fees,\nrating agency fees and other expenses\nallocable to the offering, including, for\nsecurities linked to an index, a licensing fee\npayable to the sponsor of the index.\n\nThe original public offering price of an\noffering of securities will include the agent\ndiscount or commission indicated in the\napplicable pricing supplement, the offering\nexpenses described in the preceding paragraph\nassociated with that offering, the projected\nprofit our or Wells Fargo Finance LLC\u2019s\nhedge counterparty expects to realize in\nconsideration for assuming the risks inherent\nin hedging our or Wells Fargo Finance LLC\u2019s\nobligations under the securities and any other\ncosts identified in the applicable pricing\nsupplement. We and Wells Fargo Finance\nLLC expect to hedge our or Wells Fargo Finance\nLLC\u2019s, as applicable, obligations under the\nsecurities through affiliated\nor unaffiliated counterparties. Because\nhedging our and Wells Fargo Finance LLC\u2019s\nobligations entails risk and may be influenced\nby market forces beyond our or Wells Fargo\nFinance LLC\u2019s or our or Wells Fargo Finance\nLLC\u2019s counterparty\u2019s control,\nsuch hedging may result in a profit that is\nmore or less than expected, or could result in\na loss. The discount or commission,\noffering expenses, projected profit of our or\nWells Fargo Finance LLC\u2019s hedge counterparty\nand any other costs identified\nin the applicable pricing supplement reduce\nthe economic terms of the securities. In\naddition, the fact that the original offering\nprice includes these items is expected to\nadversely affect the secondary market prices\nof the securities. These secondary market\nprices are also likely to be reduced by the\ncost of unwinding the related hedging\ntransaction.\n\nWhen we and Wells Fargo Finance LLC issue\nthe securities offered by this prospectus,\nexcept for securities issued upon a reopening\nof an existing tranche or series of\nsecurities,\nthey will be new securities without an\nestablished trading market. Unless otherwise\nprovided in the applicable pricing supplement,\nneither we nor Wells Fargo Finance LLC intend\nto apply for the listing of the securities on\nany national securities exchange or\nautomated quotation system. An agent may make\na market for the securities, as applicable\nlaws and regulations permit, but is not\nobligated to do so and may discontinue making\na market in any or all of the securities at\nany time without notice. No assurance\ncan be given as to the liquidity of any\ntrading market for these securities.\n\nWhen an agent acts as principal for its\nown account, to facilitate the offering of the\nsecurities, the agent may engage in\ntransactions that stabilize, maintain or\notherwise\naffect the price of the securities.\nSpecifically, the agent may overallot in\nconnection with any offering of the\nsecurities, creating\na short position in the securities for its own\naccount. In addition, to cover overallotments\nor to stabilize the price of the securities,\nthe agent may bid for, and purchase, the\nsecurities in the open market. Finally, in any\noffering of the securities by an agent\nthrough dealers, the agent may reclaim selling\nconcessions allowed to a dealer for\ndistributing the securities in the offering\nif the agent repurchases previously\ndistributed securities in stabilization\ntransactions or otherwise. Any of these\nactivities\nmay stabilize or maintain the market price of\nthe securities above independent market\nlevels. The agents are not required to engage\nin these activities, and may end any of these\nactivities at any time.\n\nPurchasers of our and Wells Fargo Finance\nLLC\u2019s securities may be required to pay stamp\ntaxes and other charges in accordance with the\nlaws and practices of the country\nof purchase in addition to the original public\noffering price disclosed in the applicable\npricing supplement.\n\nAgents and their affiliates may be customers\nof, engage in transactions with, or perform\nservices, including investment and/or\ncommercial banking services, for us, Wells\nFargo\nFinance LLC, our subsidiaries or Wells Fargo\nFinance LLC\u2019s affiliates in the ordinary\ncourse of their businesses. In connection\nwith the distribution of the securities\noffered under this prospectus, we and Wells\nFargo Finance LLC may enter into swap or other\nhedging transactions with, or arranged by,\nagents or their affiliates. These agents or\ntheir affiliates may receive compensation,\ntrading gain or other benefits from these\ntransactions.\n\nDelivery of the securities will be made\nagainst payment therefor on or about the issue\ndate specified in the applicable pricing\nsupplement. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange\nAct trades in the secondary market generally\nare required to settle in two business days\nafter the date the securities are priced,\nunless the parties to any such trade expressly\nagree otherwise. Accordingly, if the\napplicable pricing supplement specifies that\nthe issue date is more\n                      60                      \nthan two business days after the date on which\nthe securities are priced, purchasers who wish\nto trade such securities at any time prior to\nthe second business day preceding the issue\ndate will be required, by virtue of the fact\nthat the securities will not settle in T+2, to\nspecify an alternative settlement cycle at the\ntime of any such trade to prevent a failed\nsettlement; such purchasers should also\nconsult their own advisors in this regard.\n\nEach agent will agree that it will, to the\nbest of its knowledge and belief, comply with\nall applicable securities laws and regulations\nin force in any jurisdiction in which\nit purchases, offers, sells or delivers our\nand Wells Fargo Finance LLC\u2019s securities or\npossesses or distributes this prospectus\nor any other offering material and will obtain\nany required consent, approval or permission\nfor its purchase, offer, sale or delivery\nof such securities under the laws and\nregulations in force in any jurisdiction to\nwhich it is subject or in which it makes\npurchases,\noffers, sales or deliveries.

In this case, the applicable\nprospectus supplement or pricing supplement\nwill include additional information with\nrespect to the plan of distribution, including\nthe terms of the offering.\n                      61                      \n                                              \n                LEGAL OPINIONS                \nFaegre Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP will\nissue an opinion about the legality of the\nsecurities offered by this prospectus.
