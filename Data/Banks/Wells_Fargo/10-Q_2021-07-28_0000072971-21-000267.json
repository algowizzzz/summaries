Prior period risk-based\ncapital and certain other regulatory related\nmetrics were not revised. For additional\ninformation, see the \u201cRecent Developments\u201d\nsection and Note 1 (Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) to Financial Statements\nin this Report.\n\n(2) Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is\ntotal revenue less noninterest expense.\nManagement believes that PTPP is a useful\nfinancial measure because it enables investors\nand others to assess the Company\u2019s ability to\ngenerate capital to cover credit losses\nthrough a credit cycle.\n\n(3) In second quarter 2020, diluted average\ncommon shares outstanding equaled average\ncommon shares outstanding because our\nsecurities convertible into common shares had\nan anti-dilutive effect.\n\n(4) Book value per common share is common\nstockholders' equity divided by common shares\noutstanding. Tangible book value per common\nshare is tangible common equity divided by\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\n(5) Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure and represents total equity\nless preferred equity, noncontrolling\ninterests, goodwill, certain identifiable\nintangible assets (other than mortgage\nservicing rights) and goodwill and other\nintangibles on nonmarketable equity\nsecurities, net of applicable deferred taxes.\nThe methodology of determining tangible common\nequity may differ among companies. Management\nbelieves that return on average tangible\ncommon equity and tangible book value per\ncommon share, which utilize tangible common\nequity, are useful financial measures because\nthey enable management, investors, and others\nto assess the Company\u2019s use of equity. For\nadditional information, including a\ncorresponding reconciliation to generally\naccepted accounting principles (GAAP)\nfinancial measures, see the \u201cCapital\nManagement \u2013 Tangible Common Equity\u201d section\nin this Report.\n\n(6) Represents Wells Fargo net income (loss)\ndivided by average assets.\n\n(7) Represents Wells Fargo net income (loss)\napplicable to common stock divided by average\ncommon stockholders\u2019 equity.\n\n(8) The efficiency ratio is noninterest\nexpense divided by total revenue (net interest\nincome and noninterest income).\n\n(9) The information presented reflects fully\nphased-in CET1, tier 1 capital, and RWAs, but\nreflects total capital in accordance with\ntransition requirements.

Addressing\nthese regulatory\nactions is expected to\ntake multiple years,\nand we may experience\nissues or delays along\nthe way in satisfying\ntheir requirements.\nIssues or delays with\none regulatory action\ncould affect our\nprogress on others,\nand failure to satisfy\nthe requirements of a\nregulatory action on a\ntimely basis could\nresult in additional\npenalties, enforcement\nactions, and other\nnegative consequences.\nWhile we still have\nsignificant work to\ndo, the Company is\ncommitted to devoting\nthe resources\nnecessary to operate\nwith strong business\npractices and\ncontrols, maintain the\nhighest level of\nintegrity, and have an\nappropriate culture in\nplace.\n\nFederal Reserve Board\nConsent Order\nRegarding Governance\nOversight and\nCompliance and\nOperational Risk\nManagement\n\nOn February 2, 2018,\nthe Company entered\ninto a consent order\nwith the Board of\nGovernors of the\nFederal Reserve System\n(FRB). As required by\nthe consent order, the\nCompany\u2019s Board of\nDirectors (Board)\nsubmitted to the FRB a\nplan to further\nenhance the Board\u2019s\ngovernance and\noversight of the\nCompany, and the\nCompany submitted to\nthe FRB a plan to\nfurther improve the\nCompany\u2019s compliance\nand operational risk\nmanagement program.\nThe Company continues\nto engage with the FRB\nas the Company works\nto address the consent\norder provisions. The\nconsent order also\nrequires the Company,\nfollowing the FRB\u2019s\nacceptance and\napproval of the plans\nand the Company\u2019s\nadoption and\nimplementation of the\nplans, to complete an\ninitial third-party\nreview of the\nenhancements and\nimprovements provided\nfor in the plans.\nUntil this third-party\nreview is complete and\nthe plans are approved\nand implemented to the\nsatisfaction\n\nof the FRB, the\nCompany\u2019s total\nconsolidated assets as\ndefined under the\nconsent order will be\nlimited to the level\nas of December 31,\n2017. Compliance with\nthis asset cap is\nmeasured on a two-\nquarter daily average\nbasis to allow for\nmanagement of\ntemporary\nfluctuations. Due to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic,\non April 8, 2020, the\nFRB amended the\nconsent order to allow\nthe Company to exclude\nfrom the asset cap any\non-balance sheet\nexposure resulting\nfrom loans made by the\nCompany in connection\nwith the Small\nBusiness\nAdministration\u2019s\nPaycheck Protection\nProgram and the FRB\u2019s\nMain Street Lending\nProgram. As required\nunder the amendment to\nthe consent order, to\nthe extent the Company\nchooses to exclude\nthese exposures from\nthe asset cap, certain\nfees and other\neconomic benefits\nreceived by the\nCompany from loans\nmade in connection\nwith these programs\nshall be transferred\nto the U.S. Treasury\nor to non-profit\norganizations approved\nby the FRB that\nsupport small\nbusinesses. As of June\n30, 2021, the Company\nhad not excluded these\nexposures from the\nasset cap. After\nremoval of the asset\ncap, a second third-\nparty review must also\nbe conducted to assess\nthe efficacy and\nsustainability of the\nenhancements and\nimprovements.\n\nConsent Orders with\nthe Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau and\nOffice of the\nComptroller of the\nCurrency Regarding\nCompliance Risk\nManagement Program,\nAutomobile Collateral\nProtection Insurance\nPolicies, and Mortgage\nInterest Rate Lock\nExtensions\n\nOn April 20, 2018, the\nCompany entered into\nconsent orders with\nthe Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau\n(CFPB) and the Office\nof the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (OCC) to\npay an aggregate of $1\nbillion in civil money\npenalties to resolve\nmatters regarding the\nCompany\u2019s compliance\nrisk management\nprogram and past\npractices involving\ncertain automobile\ncollateral protection\ninsurance (CPI)\npolicies and certain\nmortgage interest rate\nlock extensions. As\nrequired by the\nconsent orders, the\nCompany submitted to\nthe CFPB and OCC an\nenterprise-wide\ncompliance risk\nmanagement plan and a\nplan to enhance the\nCompany\u2019s internal\naudit program with\nrespect to federal\nconsumer financial law\nand the terms of the\nconsent orders. In\naddition, as required\nby the consent orders,\nthe Company submitted\nfor non-objection\nplans to remediate\ncustomers affected by\nthe automobile\ncollateral protection\ninsurance and mortgage\ninterest rate lock\nmatters, as well as a\nplan for the\nmanagement of\nremediation activities\nconducted by the\nCompany. The Company\ncontinues to work to\naddress the provisions\nof the consent orders.\nThe Company has not\nyet satisfied certain\naspects of the consent\norders, and as a\nresult, we believe\nregulators may impose\nadditional penalties\nor take other\nenforcement actions.\n                              \n  Wells Fargo & Company    3  \n                              \n                                              \n  Overview(continued)                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  Retail Sales Practices Matters              \n                                              \nIn September 2016, we\nannounced settlements\nwith the CFPB, the\nOCC, and the Office of\nthe Los Angeles City\nAttorney, and entered\ninto related consent\norders with the CFPB\nand the OCC, in\nconnection with\nallegations that some\nof our retail\ncustomers received\nproducts and services\nthey did not request.\nAs a result, it\nremains a top priority\nto rebuild trust\nthrough a\ncomprehensive action\nplan that includes\nmaking things right\nfor our customers,\nemployees, and other\nstakeholders, and\nbuilding a better\nCompany for the\nfuture. Our priority\nof rebuilding trust\nhas included numerous\nactions focused on\nidentifying potential\nfinancial harm to\ncustomers resulting\nfrom these matters and\nproviding remediation.\n\nFor additional\ninformation regarding\nretail sales practices\nmatters, including\nrelated legal matters,\nsee the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nsection in our 2020\nForm 10-K and Note 13\n(Legal Actions) to\nFinancial Statements\nin this Report.\n                                              \n  Other Customer Remediation Activities       \n                                              \nOur priority of\nrebuilding trust has\nalso included an\neffort to identify\nother areas or\ninstances where\ncustomers may have\nexperienced financial\nharm, provide\nremediation as\nappropriate, and\nimplement additional\noperational and\ncontrol procedures. We\nare working with our\nregulatory agencies in\nthis effort. We have\npreviously disclosed\nkey areas of focus as\npart of our rebuilding\ntrust efforts and are\nin the process of\nproviding remediation\nfor those matters. We\nhave accrued for the\nprobable and estimable\nremediation costs\nrelated to our\nrebuilding trust\nefforts, which amounts\nmay change based on\nadditional facts and\ninformation, as well\nas ongoing reviews and\ncommunications with\nour regulators.\n\nAs our ongoing reviews\ncontinue, it is\npossible that in the\nfuture we may identify\nadditional items or\nareas of potential\nconcern. To the extent\nissues are identified,\nwe will continue to\nassess any customer\nharm and provide\nremediation as\nappropriate.

We\nreclassified the\ninvestment tax credits\non our consolidated\nbalance sheet from\naccrued expenses and\nother liabilities to a\nreduction of the\ncarrying value of the\ninvestment balances.\nWe also reclassified\nthe investment tax\ncredits from income\ntax expense to\ninterest income for\nsolar energy leases or\nnoninterest income for\nsolar energy equity\ninvestments.\n\nThese changes had a\nnominal impact on net\nincome and retained\nearnings on an annual\nbasis; however, our\nquarterly results were\naffected in both the\nsecond and third\nquarters of\n\n2020 due to the impact\nof these changes on\nthe estimated annual\neffective income tax\nrate applied to each\nquarter. These changes\nalso improved our\nefficiency ratio and\ngenerally increased\nour effective income\ntax rate from what was\npreviously reported.\n\nPrior period financial\nstatement line items\nhave been revised to\nconform with the\ncurrent period\npresentation. Prior\nperiod risk-based\ncapital and certain\nother regulatory\nrelated metrics were\nnot revised.

Since\nits inception, we have\nfunded approximately\n282,000 loans under\nthe PPP totaling\napproximately $14.0\nbillion, and more than\n$5.8 billion of\nprincipal forgiveness\nhas been provided on\nqualifying PPP loans.\nWe deferred\napproximately $420\nmillion of SBA\nprocessing fees in\n2020 that will be\nrecognized as interest\nincome over the terms\nof the loans. We\nvoluntarily committed\nto donate all of the\ngross processing fees\nreceived from PPP\nloans funded in 2020.\nThrough June 30, 2021,\nwe donated\napproximately $260\nmillion of these\nprocessing fees. We\nfunded approximately\n$3.5 billion of PPP\nloans in the first\nhalf of 2021 and\ndeferred approximately\n$270 million of\nrelated SBA processing\nfees that will be\nrecognized as interest\nincome over the terms\nof the loans.

Credit Risk\nManagement We define\ncredit risk as the\nrisk of loss\nassociated with a\nborrower or\ncounterparty default\n(failure to meet\nobligations in\naccordance with agreed\nupon terms). Credit\nrisk exists with many\nof our assets and\nexposures such as debt\nsecurity holdings,\ncertain derivatives,\nand loans. The Board\u2019s\nRisk Committee has\nprimary oversight\nresponsibility for\ncredit risk. A Credit\nSubcommittee of the\nRisk Committee assists\nthe Risk Committee in\nproviding oversight of\ncredit risk. At the\nmanagement level,\nCredit Risk, which is\npart of IRM, has\noversight\nresponsibility for\ncredit risk. Credit\nRisk reports to the\nCRO and supports\nperiodic reports\nrelated to credit risk\nprovided to the\nBoard\u2019s Risk Committee\nor its Credit\nSubcommittee.

We employ various credit risk\nmanagement and monitoring activities to\nmitigate risks associated with multiple risk\nfactors affecting loans we hold including:\n\n\u2022 Loan concentrations and related credit\nquality; \u2022 Counterparty credit risk; \u2022\nEconomic and market conditions; \u2022 Legislative\nor regulatory mandates; \u2022 Changes in interest\nrates; \u2022 Merger and acquisition activities;\nand \u2022 Reputation risk. Our credit risk\nmanagement oversight process is governed\ncentrally, but provides for direct management\nand accountability by our lines of business.\nOur overall credit process includes\ncomprehensive credit policies, disciplined\ncredit underwriting, frequent and detailed\nrisk measurement and modeling, extensive\ncredit training programs, and a continual loan\nreview and audit process. A key to our credit\nrisk management is adherence to a well-\ncontrolled underwriting process, which we\nbelieve is appropriate for the needs of our\ncustomers as well as investors who purchase\nthe loans or securities collateralized by the\nloans. Credit Quality Overview Credit quality\nin second quarter 2021 reflected continued\nimprovement in the economic environment. In\nparticular: \u2022 Nonaccrual loans were $7.4\nbillion at June 30, 2021, down from $8.7\nbillion at December 31, 2020. Commercial\nnonaccrual loans decreased to $3.5 billion at\nJune 30, 2021, compared with $4.8 billion at\nDecember 31, 2020, and consumer nonaccrual\nloans declined to $3.8 billion at June 30,\n2021, compared with $3.9 billion at December\n31, 2020. Nonaccrual loans represented 0.86%\nof total loans at June 30, 2021, compared with\n0.98% at December 31, 2020. \u2022 Net loan charge-\noffs as a percentage of our average commercial\nand consumer loan portfolios were 0.07% and\n0.32% in the second quarter and 0.10% and\n0.35% in the first half of 2021, respectively,\ncompared with 0.44% and 0.48% in the second\nquarter and 0.35% and 0.51% in the first half\nof 2020. \u2022 Loans that are not government\ninsured/guaranteed and 90 days or more past\ndue and still accruing were $277 million and\n$460 million in our commercial and consumer\nportfolios, respectively, at June 30, 2021,\ncompared with $78 million and $612 million at\nDecember 31, 2020. \u2022 Our provision for credit\nlosses for loans was $(1.2) billion and $(2.4)\nbillion in the second quarter and first half\nof 2021, respectively, compared with $9.6\nbillion and $13.4 billion for the same periods\na year ago. \u2022 The ACL for loans decreased to\n$16.4 billion, or 1.92% of total loans, at\nJune 30, 2021, compared with $19.7 billion, or\n2.22%, at December 31, 2020.

With the\nexception of\nresidential mortgage-\nrelated accommodation\nprograms, the COVID-\nrelated lending\naccommodations\ninstituted during 2020\nwere no longer offered\nas of December 31,\n2020. Residential\nmortgage accommodation\nprograms, which\ncontinued during the\nfirst half of 2021,\noffered payment\ndeferrals for up to a\ntotal of 18 months.\nTable 10 summarizes\nthe unpaid principal\nbalance (UPB) of\nconsumer loans that\nreceived\naccommodations under\nloan modification\nprograms established\nto assist customers\nwith the economic\nimpact of the COVID-19\npandemic (COVID-\nrelated modifications)\nand that remained in a\ndeferral period as of\nJune 30, 2021.\n\nBased on guidance in\nthe CARES Act and the\nI nteragency Statement\non Loan Modifications\nand Reporting for\nFinancial Institutions\nWorking with Customers\nAffected by the\nCoronavirus (Revised)\nissued by federal\nbanking regulators in\nApril 2020 (the\nInteragency\nStatement), both of\nwhich we elected to\napply, loan\nmodifications related\nto COVID-19 and that\nmeet certain other\ncriteria are exempt\nfrom troubled debt\nrestructuring (TDR)\nclassification.\nAdditionally, our\nelection to apply the\nTDR relief provided by\nthe CARES Act and the\nInteragency Statement\nimpacts our regulatory\ncapital ratios as\nthese loan\nmodifications\n\nrelated to COVID-19\nare not adjusted to a\nhigher risk-weighting\nnormally required with\nTDR classification. At\nJune 30, 2021,\nsubstantially all\nresidential mortgage\nloans that were in a\ndeferral period,\nexcluding those that\nwere government\ninsured/guaranteed,\nmet the criteria for\nTDR relief and were\ntherefore not\nclassified as TDRs.\nFor additional\ninformation regarding\nthe TDR relief\nprovided by the CARES\nAct and the clarifying\nTDR accounting\nguidance from the\nInteragency Statement,\nsee Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial\nStatements in our 2020\nForm 10-K.\n\nCustomer payment\ndeferral activities\ninstituted in response\nto the COVID-19\npandemic could\ncontinue to delay the\nrecognition of net\ncharge-offs,\ndelinquencies, and\nnonaccrual status for\nthose customers who\nwould have otherwise\nmoved into past due or\nnonaccrual status.\nCustomer loans that\nare not further\nmodified upon exit\nfrom the deferral\nperiod may be placed\non nonaccrual status\nor charged-off in\naccordance with our\npolicies if customers\nare unable to resume\nmaking payments in\naccordance with the\ncontractual terms of\ntheir agreement.

The downside\nscenario assumed\nsustained adverse\neconomic impacts\nresulting from the\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic,\ncompared with the base\nscenario. The downside\nscenario assumed U.S.\nreal GDP growth rates\ndecline in the first\nhalf of 2022 before\nreturning to\nnormalized levels\nafter 2023 and the\nU.S. unemployment rate\nincreases through 2022\nand peaks in the first\nhalf of 2023. We\nconsidered within each\nscenario our\nexpectations for the\nimpact of customer\naccommodation\nactivity, as well as\nthe estimated impact\non certain industries\nthat we consider to be\ndirectly and most\nadversely affected by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn addition to\nquantitative\nestimates, we consider\nqualitative factors\nthat represent risks\ninherent in our\nprocesses and\nassumptions such as\neconomic environmental\nfactors, modeling\nassumptions and\nperformance, and other\nsubjective factors,\nincluding industry\ntrends and emerging\nrisk assessments. We\nalso considered the\nsignificant\nuncertainty related to\nthe duration and\nseverity of the\neconomic impacts from\nthe COVID-19 pandemic\nand the incremental\nrisks to our loan\nportfolio.\n\nThe forecasted key\neconomic variables\nused in our estimate\nof the ACL for loans\nat June 30 and March\n31, 2021, are\npresented in Table 27.\n                               \n  44    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 27: Forecasted\nKey Economic Variables\n                                              \n              4Q           2Q           4Q    \n              2021         2022         2022  \n  Bl\u2026                                         \n  of                                          \n  ec\u2026                                         \n  sc\u2026                                         \n  (1\u2026                                         \n  U.\u2026                                         \n  un\u2026                                         \n  ra\u2026                                         \n  (2\u2026                                         \n  Ma\u2026                                         \n  31,    6.5  %       7.0          7.1        \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Ju\u2026                                         \n  30,    5.6          6.2          6.9        \n  20\u2026                                         \n  U.\u2026                                         \n  re\u2026                                         \n  GDP                                         \n  (3\u2026                                         \n  Ma\u2026                                         \n  31,    -1\u2026          -0\u2026          1.8        \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Ju\u2026                                         \n  30,    1.0          -0\u2026          0.6        \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Ho\u2026                                         \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  in\u2026                                         \n  (4\u2026                                         \n  Ma\u2026                                         \n  31,    1.0          -5\u2026          -5\u2026        \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Ju\u2026                                         \n  30,    2.8          -6\u2026          -5\u2026        \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Co\u2026                                         \n  re\u2026                                         \n  es\u2026                                         \n  as\u2026                                         \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  (4\u2026                                         \n  Ma\u2026                                         \n  31,    -1\u2026          -1\u2026          -9\u2026        \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Ju\u2026                                         \n  30,    -7\u2026          -1\u2026          -1\u2026        \n  20\u2026                                         \n                                              \n(1) Represents a weighting of the forecasted\neconomic variable inputs based on a weighting\nof 50% for the base and 50% for a downside\nscenario at both June 30 and March 31, 2021.\n(2) Quarterly average. (3) Percent change from\nthe preceding period, seasonally adjusted\nannualized rate. (4) Percent change year over\nyear of national average; outlook differs by\ngeography and property type. Future amounts of\nthe ACL for loans will be based on a variety\nof factors, including loan balance changes,\nportfolio credit quality and mix changes, and\nchanges in general economic conditions and\nexpectations (including for unemployment and\nGDP), among other factors. We observed\neconomic improvements in the first half of\n2021; however, there remained significant\nuncertainty related to the length and severity\nof the economic impact of the COVID-19\npandemic and the impact of other factors that\nmay influence the level of eventual losses and\ncorresponding requirements for future amounts\nof the ACL, including the impact of economic\nstimulus programs and customer accommodation\nactivity. The COVID-19 pandemic could continue\nto impact the recognition of credit losses in\nour loan portfolios and may result in\nincreases in our ACL, particularly if the\nimpact on the economy worsens. We believe the\nACL for loans of $16.4 billion at June 30,\n2021, was appropriate to cover expected credit\nlosses, including unfunded credit commitments,\nat that date. The entire allowance is\navailable to absorb credit losses from the\ntotal loan portfolio. The ACL for loans is\nsubject to change and reflects existing\nfactors as of the date of determination,\nincluding economic or market conditions and\nongoing internal and external examination\nprocesses. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL\nfor loans to changes in the economic and\nbusiness environment, it is possible that we\nwill incur incremental credit losses not\nanticipated as of the balance sheet date. Our\nprocess for determining the ACL is discussed\nin the \u201cCritical Accounting Policies \u2013\nAllowance for Credit Losses\u201d section and Note\n1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies)\nto Financial Statements in our 2020 Form 10-K.\nLIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE LOSSES\nFor information on our repurchase liability,\nsee the \u201cRisk Management \u2013 Credit Risk\nManagement \u2013 Liability For Mortgage Loan\nRepurchase Losses\u201d section in our 2020 Form\n10-K. RISKS RELATING TO SERVICING ACTIVITIES\nIn addition to servicing loans in our\nportfolio, we act as servicer and/or master\nservicer of residential mortgage loans\nincluded in GSE-guaranteed mortgage\nsecuritizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage\nsecuritizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed\nmortgages and\n\nprivate label mortgage securitizations, as\nwell as for unsecuritized loans owned by\ninstitutional investors. As a servicer, we are\nrequired to advance certain delinquent\npayments of principal and interest on mortgage\nloans we service. The amount and timing of\nreimbursement of advances of delinquent\npayments vary by investor and the applicable\nservicing agreements. Due to payment deferrals\nprovided as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nthe amount of our servicing advances of\nprincipal and interest remained elevated. The\namount of these advances may increase if\nadditional payment deferrals are provided.\nPayment deferrals also delay the collection of\ncontractually specified servicing fees,\nresulting in lower net servicing income. Upon\ntransfer as servicer, we retain the option to\nrepurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization\npools, which becomes exercisable when three\nscheduled loan payments remain unpaid by the\nborrower. We generally repurchase these loans\nfor cash and as a result, our total\nconsolidated assets do not change. As a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, our repurchases of\nthese loans were elevated in 2020 but returned\nto more normalized levels in the first half of\n2021. Repurchased loans that regain current\nstatus or are otherwise modified in accordance\nwith applicable servicing guidelines may be\nincluded in future GNMA loan securitization\npools. However, in accordance with guidance\nissued by GNMA, certain loans repurchased\nafter June 30, 2020, are ineligible for\ninclusion in future GNMA loan securitization\npools until the borrower has timely made six\nconsecutive payments. This requirement may\ndelay our ability to resell loans into the\nsecuritization market. For additional\ninformation about the risks related to our\nservicing activities, see the \u201cRisk Management\n\u2013 Credit Risk Management \u2013 Risks Relating to\nServicing Activities\u201d section in our 2020 Form\n10-K. For additional information on mortgage\nbanking activities, see Note 9 (Mortgage\nBanking Activities) to Financial Statements in\nthis Report. Asset/Liability Management\nAsset/liability management involves\nevaluating, monitoring and managing interest\nrate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding.\nFor information on our oversight of\nasset/liability risks, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Asset/Liability Management\u201d\nsection in our 2020 Form 10-K. INTEREST RATE\nRISK Interest rate risk is created in our role\nas a financial intermediary for customers\nbased on investments such as loans and other\nextensions of credit and debt securities.\nInterest rate risk can have a significant\nimpact to our earnings. We are subject to\ninterest rate risk because: \u2022 assets and\nliabilities may mature or reprice at different\ntimes. If assets reprice faster than\nliabilities and interest rates are generally\nrising, earnings will initially increase; \u2022\nassets and liabilities may reprice at the same\ntime but by different amounts; \u2022 short-term\nand long-term market interest rates may change\nby different amounts. For example, the shape\nof the yield curve may affect yield for new\nloans and funding costs differently; \u2022 the\nremaining maturity for various assets or\nliabilities may shorten or lengthen as\ninterest rates change. For example, if long-\nterm mortgage interest rates increase sharply,\nMBS held in the debt securities portfolio may\npay down at a slower rate than anticipated,\nwhich could impact portfolio income; or\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    45  \n                               \nRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement ( continued\n)\n\n\u2022 interest rates may\nhave a direct or\nindirect effect on\nloan demand,\ncollateral values,\ncredit losses,\nmortgage origination\nvolume, and the fair\nvalue of MSRs and\nother financial\ninstruments. We assess\ninterest rate risk by\ncomparing outcomes\nunder various net\ninterest income\nsimulations using many\ninterest rate\nscenarios that differ\nin the direction of\ninterest rate changes,\nthe degree of change\nover time, the speed\nof change and the\nprojected shape of the\nyield curve. These\nsimulations require\nassumptions regarding\ndrivers of earnings\nand balance sheet\ncomposition such as\nloan originations,\nprepayment speeds on\nloans and debt\nsecurities, deposit\nflows and mix, as well\nas pricing strategies.\nOur most recent\nsimulations, as\npresented in Table 28,\nestimate net interest\nincome sensitivity\nover the next 12\nmonths using\ninstantaneous\nmovements across the\nyield curve with both\nlower and higher\ninterest rates\nrelative to our base\nscenario. Steeper and\nflatter scenarios\nmeasure non-parallel\nchanges in the yield\ncurve, with long-term\ninterest rates defined\nas all tenors three\nyears and longer\n(e.g., 10-year U.S.\nTreasury securities)\nand short-term\ninterest rates defined\nas all tenors less\nthan three years.\nWhere applicable, U.S.\ndollar interest rates\nare floored at 0.00%.\nThe following\ndescribes the\nsimulation assumptions\nfor the scenarios\npresented in Table 28:\n\u2022 Simulations are\ndynamic and reflect\nanticipated changes to\nour assets and\nliabilities. \u2022 Other\nmacroeconomic\nvariables that could\nbe correlated with the\nchanges in interest\nrates are held\nconstant. \u2022 Mortgage\nprepayment and\norigination\nassumptions vary\nacross scenarios and\nreflect only the\nimpact of the higher\nor lower interest\nrates. \u2022 Our base\nscenario deposit\nforecast incorporates\nmix changes consistent\nwith the base interest\nrate trajectory.\nDeposit mix is modeled\nto be the same as in\nthe base scenario\nacross the alternative\nscenarios. In higher\ninterest rate\nscenarios, customer\nactivity that shifts\nbalances into higher-\nyielding products\ncould reduce expected\nnet interest income. \u2022\nWe hold the size of\nthe projected debt and\nequity securities\nportfolios constant\nacross scenarios.\nTable 28: Net Interest\nIncome Sensitivity\n                                              \n                     Jun                      \n  ($ in              30,             Dec 31,  \n  billi\u2026             2021            2020     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Paral\u2026                                      \n  Shift:                                      \n  +100                                        \n  bps                                         \n  shift     $   7.0             6.7           \n  in                                          \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  rates                                       \n  -100                                        \n  bps                                         \n  shift        -2.9            -2.7           \n  in                                          \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  rates                                       \n  Steep\u2026                                      \n  yield                                       \n  curve:                                      \n  +50                                         \n  bps                                         \n  shift                                       \n  in            1.2             1.3           \n  long-\u2026                                      \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  rates                                       \n  Flatt\u2026                                      \n  yield                                       \n  curve:                                      \n  +50                                         \n  bps                                         \n  shift                                       \n  in            2.5             2.2           \n  short\u2026                                      \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  rates                                       \n  -50                                         \n  bps                                         \n  shift                                       \n  in           -1.2            -1.4           \n  long-\u2026                                      \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  rates                                       \n                                              \nThe interest rate sensitivity included in\nTable 28 indicates that we would expect to\nbenefit from higher interest rates as our\nassets would reprice faster and to a greater\ndegree than our liabilities, while in the case\nof lower interest rates, our assets would\nreprice downward and to a greater degree than\nour liabilities resulting in lower net\ninterest income. The sensitivity results above\ndo not capture noninterest income or expense\nimpacts. Our interest rate sensitive\nnoninterest income and expense are\npredominantly driven by mortgage banking\nactivities, and may move in the opposite\ndirection of our net interest income.

For additional information on our\ntrading assets and liabilities, see Note 2\n(Trading Activities) to Financial Statements\nin this Report. We use the debt securities\nportfolio and exchange-traded and over-the-\ncounter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to\nmanage our interest rate exposures. See Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies),\nNote 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\nMaturity Debt Securities) and Note 14\n(Derivatives) to Financial Statements in our\n2020 Form 10-K for additional information.\nMORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK\nWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans,\nwhich subjects us to various risks, including\ncredit, liquidity and interest rate risks. For\nadditional information on mortgage banking\ninterest rate and market risk, see Note 9\n(Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial\nStatements in this Report and the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Asset/Liability Management \u2013\nMortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market\nRisk\u201d section in our 2020 Form 10-K. Hedging\nthe various sources of interest rate risk in\nmortgage banking is a complex process that\nrequires sophisticated modeling and constant\nmonitoring. There are several potential risks\nto earnings from mortgage banking related to\norigination volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs\nand associated hedging results, the\nrelationship and degree of volatility between\nshort-term and long-term interest rates, and\nchanges in servicing and foreclosures costs.\nWhile we attempt to balance our mortgage\nbanking interest rate and market risks, the\nfinancial instruments we use may not perfectly\ncorrelate with the values and income being\nhedged. MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of\npossible economic loss from adverse changes in\nmarket risk factors such as interest rates,\ncredit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity\nand commodity prices, and the risk of possible\nloss due to counterparty exposure. This\napplies to implied volatility risk, basis\nrisk, and market liquidity risk. It also\nincludes price risk in the trading book,\nmortgage servicing rights and the hedge\neffectiveness risk associated with the\nmortgage book, and impairment on private\nequity investments. For information on our\noversight of market risk, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Asset/Liability Management \u2013\nMarket Risk\u201d section in our 2020 Form 10-K.\nMARKET RISK \u2013 TRADING ACTIVITIES We engage in\ntrading activities to accommodate the\ninvestment and risk management activities of\nour customers and to execute economic hedging\nto manage certain balance sheet risks. These\ntrading activities predominantly occur within\nour CIB businesses and to a lesser extent\nother businesses of the Company. Debt\nsecurities held for trading, equity securities\nheld for trading, trading loans and trading\nderivatives are financial instruments used in\nour trading activities, and all are carried at\nfair value. Income earned on the financial\ninstruments used in our trading activities\ninclude net interest income, changes in fair\nvalue and realized gains and losses. Net\ninterest income earned from our trading\nactivities is reflected in the interest income\nand interest expense components of our\nconsolidated statement of income. Changes in\nfair value of the financial instruments used\nin our trading activities are reflected in net\ngains from trading activities. For additional\ninformation on the financial instruments used\nin our trading activities and the income from\nthese trading activities, see Note 2 (Trading\nActivities) to Financial Statements in this\nReport.\n                               \n  46    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nValue-at-risk (VaR) is\na statistical risk\nmeasure used to\nestimate the potential\nloss from adverse\nmoves in the financial\nmarkets. The Company\nuses VaR metrics\ncomplemented with\nsensitivity analysis\nand stress testing in\nmeasuring and\nmonitoring market\nrisk. For additional\ninformation on our\nmonitoring activities,\nsensitivity analysis\nand stress testing,\nsee the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Market\nRisk \u2013 Trading\nActivities\u201d section in\nour 2020 Form 10-K.\n\nTrading VaR is the\nmeasure used to\nprovide insight into\nthe market risk\nexhibited by the\nCompany\u2019s trading\npositions. The Company\ncalculates Trading VaR\nfor risk management\npurposes to establish\nline of business and\nCompany-wide risk\nlimits. Trading VaR is\ncalculated based on\nall trading positions\non our consolidated\nbalance sheet.\n\nTable 29 shows the\nCompany\u2019s Trading\nGeneral VaR by risk\ncategory. The decrease\nin average Company\nTrading General VaR\nfor the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2021,\ncompared with the same\nperiod a year ago, was\ndriven by a greater\npresence of market\nvolatility dropping\nout of the 12-month\nhistorical lookback\nwindow used to\ncalculate average\nCompany Trading\nGeneral VaR for the\nquarter ended June 30,\n2021. Market\nvolatility present in\naverage Company\nTrading General VaR\nfor the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2020, was\ndriven by the\nintroduction of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, in\nparticular, changes in\ninterest rate curves\nand a significant\nwidening of credit\nspreads.\n\nTable 29: Trading\n1-Day 99% General VaR\nby Risk Category\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) The period-end VaR\nwas less than the sum\nof the VaR components\ndescribed above, which\nis due to portfolio\ndiversification. The\ndiversification effect\narises because the\nrisks are not\nperfectly correlated\ncausing a portfolio of\npositions to usually\nbe less risky than the\nsum of the risks of\nthe positions alone.\nThe diversification\nbenefit is not\nmeaningful for low and\nhigh metrics since\nthey may occur on\ndifferent days.\n\nMARKET RISK \u2013 EQUITY\nSECURITIES We are\ndirectly and\nindirectly affected by\nchanges in the equity\nmarkets. We make and\nmanage direct\ninvestments in start-\nup businesses,\nemerging growth\ncompanies, management\nbuy-outs, acquisitions\nand corporate\nrecapitalizations. We\nalso invest in non-\naffiliated funds that\nmake similar private\nequity investments.\nFor additional\ninformation, see the\n\u201cRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Market\nRisk \u2013 Equity\nSecurities\u201d section in\nour 2020 Form 10-K.\n\nWe also have\nmarketable equity\nsecurities that\ninclude investments\nrelating to our\nventure capital\nactivities. The fair\nvalue changes in these\nmarketable equity\nsecurities are\nrecognized in net\nincome. For additional\ninformation, see Note\n6 (Equity Securities)\nto Financial\nStatements in this\nReport.\n\nChanges in equity\nmarket prices may also\nindirectly affect our\nnet income by (1) the\nvalue of third-party\nassets under\nmanagement and, hence,\nfee income, (2)\nborrowers whose\nability to repay\nprincipal and/or\ninterest may be\naffected by the stock\nmarket, or (3)\nbrokerage activity,\nrelated commission\nincome and other\nbusiness activities.\nEach business line\nmonitors and manages\nthese indirect risks.\n\nLIQUIDITY RISK AND\nFUNDING In the\nordinary course of\nbusiness, we enter\ninto contractual\nobligations that may\nrequire future cash\npayments, including\nfunding for customer\nloan requests,\ncustomer deposit\nmaturities and\nwithdrawals, debt\nservice, leases for\npremises and\nequipment, and other\ncash commitments. The\nobjective of effective\nliquidity management\nis to ensure that we\ncan meet our\ncontractual\nobligations and other\ncash commitments\nefficiently under both\nnormal operating\nconditions and under\nperiods of Wells\nFargo-specific and/or\nmarket stress. To help\nachieve this\nobjective, we monitor\nboth\n\nthe consolidated\ncompany and the Parent\non a stand-alone basis\nto ensure that the\nParent is a source of\nstrength for its\nregulated, deposit-\ntaking banking\nsubsidiaries.

Our\nobjective is to\nmaintain capital at an\namount commensurate\nwith our risk profile\nand risk tolerance\nobjectives, and to\nmeet both regulatory\nand market\nexpectations. We\nprimarily fund our\ncapital needs through\nthe retention of\nearnings net of both\ndividends and share\nrepurchases, as well\nas through the\nissuance of preferred\nstock and long- and\nshort-term debt.\nRetained earnings at\nJune 30, 2021,\nincreased $9.1 billion\nfrom December 31,\n2020, predominantly as\na result of $10.7\nbillion of Wells Fargo\nnet income, partially\noffset by $1.5 billion\nof common and\npreferred stock\ndividends. During the\nfirst half of 2021, we\nissued $819 million of\ncommon stock,\nsubstantially all of\nwhich was issued in\nconnection with\nemployee compensation\nand benefits. During\nthe first half of\n2021, we repurchased\n53 million shares of\ncommon stock at a cost\nof $2.2 billion. For\nadditional information\nabout capital\nplanning, see the\n\u201cCapital Planning and\nStress Testing\u201d\nsection below.\n\nIn the first half of\n2021, we issued $4.6\nbillion of preferred\nstock and redeemed\n$4.9 billion of\npreferred stock,\nincluding the\nredemption of the\nremaining $350 million\nof our Preferred\nStock, Series N, in\nJune 2021.

Risk-\nbased capital rules\nestablish risk-\nadjusted ratios\nrelating regulatory\ncapital to different\ncategories of assets\nand off-balance sheet\nexposures as discussed\nbelow.\n\nRISK-BASED CAPITAL AND\nRISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS\nThe Company is subject\nto rules issued by\nfederal banking\nregulators to\nimplement Basel III\ncapital requirements\nfor U.S. banking\norganizations. The\nrules contain two\nframeworks for\ncalculating capital\nrequirements, a\nStandardized Approach\nand an Advanced\nApproach applicable to\ncertain institutions,\nincluding Wells Fargo.\nOur capital adequacy\nis assessed based on\nthe lower of our risk-\nbased capital ratios\ncalculated under the\ntwo approaches. The\nCompany is required to\nsatisfy the risk-based\ncapital ratio\nrequirements to avoid\nrestrictions on\ncapital distributions\nand discretionary\nbonus payments. Table\n35 and Table 36\npresent the risk-based\ncapital requirements\napplicable to the\nCompany on a fully\nphased-in basis under\nthe Standardized\nApproach and Advanced\nApproach,\nrespectively, as of\nJune 30, 2021.\n\nTable 35: Risk-Based\nCapital Requirements \u2013\nStandardized Approach\n\nTable 36: Risk-Based\nCapital Requirements \u2013\nAdvanced Approach\n\nIn addition to the\nrisk-based capital\nrequirements described\nin Table 35 and Table\n36, if the FRB\ndetermines that a\nperiod of excessive\ncredit growth is\ncontributing to an\nincrease in systemic\nrisk, a\ncountercyclical buffer\nof up to 2.50% could\nbe added to the risk-\nbased capital ratio\nrequirements under\nfederal banking\nregulations.\n\nThe capital\nconservation buffer is\napplicable to certain\ninstitutions,\nincluding Wells Fargo,\nunder the Advanced\nApproach and is\nintended to absorb\nlosses during times of\neconomic or financial\nstress.\n\nThe stress capital\nbuffer is calculated\nbased on the decrease\nin a BHC\u2019s risk-based\ncapital ratios under\nthe severely adverse\nscenario in the FRB\u2019s\nannual supervisory\nstress test and\nrelated Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and\nReview (CCAR), plus\nfour quarters of\nplanned common stock\ndividends. Because the\nstress capital buffer\nis calculated annually\nbased on data that can\ndiffer over time, our\nstress capital buffer,\nand thus our risk-\nbased capital ratio\nrequirements under the\nStandardized Approach,\nare subject to change\nin future periods. The\nCompany\u2019s stress\ncapital buffer for the\nperiod October 1,\n2020, through\nSeptember 30, 2021, is\n2.50%. The Company\nexpects its stress\ncapital buffer for the\nperiod October 1,\n2021, through\nSeptember 30, 2022, to\nbe 3.10%. The FRB has\nindicated that it will\npublish the final\nstress capital buffer\nfor the period October\n1, 2021, through\nSeptember 30, 2022,\nfor each BHC by August\n31, 2021.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    51  \n                               \n                                              \n  Capital Management(continued)               \n                                              \nAs a global\nsystemically important\nbank (G-SIB), we are\nalso subject to the\nFRB\u2019s rule\nimplementing an\nadditional capital\nsurcharge of between\n1.00-4.50% on the\nrisk-based capital\nratio requirements of\nG-SIBs. Under the\nrule, we must annually\ncalculate our\nsurcharge under two\nmethods and use the\nhigher of the two\nsurcharges. The first\nmethod (method one)\nconsiders our size,\ninterconnectedness,\ncross-jurisdictional\nactivity,\nsubstitutability, and\ncomplexity, consistent\nwith the methodology\ndeveloped by the BCBS\nand the Financial\nStability Board (FSB).\nThe second method\n(method two) uses\nsimilar inputs, but\nreplaces\nsubstitutability with\nuse of short-term\nwholesale funding and\nwill generally result\nin higher surcharges\nthan under method one.\nBecause the G-SIB\ncapital surcharge is\ncalculated annually\nbased on data that can\ndiffer over time, the\namount of the\nsurcharge is subject\nto change in future\nyears. We expect our\nG-SIB capital\nsurcharge to decrease\nby 50 basis points to\n1.50% beginning in\nfirst quarter 2022,\nsubject to\nfinalization in fourth\nquarter 2021.\n\nThe Basel III capital\nrequirements for\ncalculating CET1 and\ntier 1 capital, along\nwith risk-weighted\nassets (RWAs), are\nfully phased-in.\nHowever, the\nrequirements for\ndetermining tier 2 and\ntotal capital are\nstill in accordance\nwith transition\nrequirements and are\nscheduled to be fully\nphased-in by the end\nof 2021.\n\nUnder the risk-based\ncapital rules, on-\nbalance sheet assets\nand credit equivalent\namounts of derivatives\nand off-balance sheet\nitems are assigned to\none of several broad\nrisk categories\n\naccording to the\nobligor, or, if\nrelevant, the\nguarantor or the\nnature of any\ncollateral. The\naggregate dollar\namount in each risk\ncategory is then\nmultiplied by the risk\nweight associated with\nthat category. The\nresulting weighted\nvalues from each of\nthe risk categories\nare aggregated for\ndetermining total\nRWAs.\n\nThe tables that follow\nprovide information\nabout our risk-based\ncapital and related\nratios as calculated\nunder Basel III\ncapital rules.\nAlthough we report\ncertain capital\namounts and ratios in\naccordance with\ntransition\nrequirements for bank\nregulatory reporting\npurposes, we manage\nour capital on a fully\nphased-in basis. For\ninformation about our\ncapital requirements\ncalculated in\naccordance with\ntransition\nrequirements, see\n\nNote 23 (Regulatory\nCapital Requirements\nand Other\nRestrictions) to\nFinancial Statements\nin this Report.\n\nTable 37 summarizes\nour CET1, tier 1\ncapital, total\ncapital, RWAs and\ncapital ratios on a\nfully phased-in basis\nat June 30, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020.\nFully phased-in total\ncapital amounts and\nratios are considered\nnon-GAAP financial\nmeasures that are used\nby management, bank\nregulatory agencies,\ninvestors and analysts\nto assess and monitor\nthe Company\u2019s capital\nposition.

OTHER\nREGULATORY CAPITAL AND\nLIQUIDITY MATTERS For\ninformation regarding\nthe U.S.\nimplementation of the\nBasel III LCR and\nNSFR, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Asset/\nLiability Management \u2013\nLiquidity Risk and\nFunding \u2013 Liquidity\nStandards\u201d section in\nthis Report. Capital\nPlanning and Stress\nTesting Our planned\nlong-term capital\nstructure is designed\nto meet regulatory and\nmarket expectations.\nWe believe that our\nlong-term targeted\ncapital structure\nenables us to invest\nin and grow our\nbusiness, satisfy our\ncustomers\u2019 financial\nneeds in varying\nenvironments, access\nmarkets, and maintain\nflexibility to return\ncapital to our\nshareholders. Our\nlong-term targeted\ncapital structure also\nconsiders capital\nlevels sufficient to\nexceed capital\nrequirements including\nthe G-SIB capital\nsurcharge.\nAccordingly, we\ncurrently target a\nlong-term CET1 capital\nratio that is 100\nbasis points above our\nregulatory requirement\nplus an incremental\nbuffer of 25 to 50\nbasis points. Our\ncapital targets are\nsubject to change\nbased on various\nfactors, including\nchanges to the\nregulatory capital\nframework and\nexpectations for large\nbanks promulgated by\nbank regulatory\nagencies, changes to\nthe regulatory\nrequirements for our\ncapital ratios,\nplanned capital\nactions, changes in\nour risk profile and\nother factors. The FRB\ncapital plan rule\nestablishes capital\nplanning and other\nrequirements that\ngovern capital\ndistributions,\nincluding dividends\nand share repurchases,\nby certain BHCs,\nincluding Wells Fargo.\nThe FRB assesses,\namong other things,\nthe overall financial\ncondition, risk\nprofile, and capital\nadequacy of BHCs when\nevaluating their\ncapital plans. On\nMarch 25, 2021, the\nFRB announced that it\nwas extending measures\nit previously\nannounced limiting\nlarge BHCs, including\nWells Fargo, from\nmaking any capital\ndistribution\n(excluding any capital\ndistribution arising\nfrom the issuance of a\ncapital instrument\neligible for inclusion\nin the numerator of a\nregulatory capital\nratio), unless\notherwise approved by\nthe FRB. The FRB\ngenerally authorized\nBHCs to (i) provided\nthat the BHC does not\nincrease the amount of\nits common stock\ndividends to\n                               \n  56    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nbe larger than the\nlevel paid in second\nquarter 2020, pay\ncommon stock dividends\nand make share\nrepurchases that, in\nthe aggregate, do not\nexceed an amount equal\nto the average of the\nBHC\u2019s net income for\nthe four preceding\ncalendar quarters;\n(ii) make share\nrepurchases that equal\nthe amount of share\nissuances related to\nexpensed employee\ncompensation; and\n(iii) redeem and make\nscheduled payments on\nadditional tier 1 and\ntier 2 capital\ninstruments. These\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions ended on\nJune 30, 2021.\n\nConcurrently with\nCCAR, federal banking\nregulators also\nrequire large BHCs and\nbanks to conduct their\nown stress tests to\nevaluate whether the\ninstitution has\nsufficient capital to\ncontinue to operate\nduring periods of\nadverse economic and\nfinancial conditions.\n\nIn June 2021, the\nCompany completed the\n2021 CCAR stress test\nprocess. On July 27,\n2021, the Board\napproved an increase\nto the Company's third\nquarter 2021 common\nstock dividend to\n$0.20 per share.\nAdditionally, our\ncapital plan includes\ngross common share\nrepurchases of\napproximately $18\nbillion for the four-\nquarter period\nbeginning third\nquarter 2021 through\nsecond quarter 2022.\n                                              \n  Securities Repurchases                      \n                                              \nFrom time to time the\nBoard authorizes the\nCompany to repurchase\nshares of our common\nstock. Although we\nannounce when the\nBoard authorizes share\nrepurchases, we\ntypically do not give\nany public notice\nbefore we repurchase\nour shares. Various\nfactors determine the\namount of our share\nrepurchases, including\nour capital\nrequirements, the\nnumber of shares we\nexpect to issue for\nemployee benefit plans\nand acquisitions,\nmarket conditions\n(including the trading\nprice of our stock),\nand regulatory and\nlegal considerations,\nincluding under the\nFRB\u2019s capital plan\nrule. Due to the\nvarious factors that\nmay impact the amount\nof our share\nrepurchases and the\nfact that we tend to\nbe in the market\nregularly to satisfy\nrepurchase\nconsiderations under\nour capital plan, our\nshare repurchases\noccur at various price\nlevels. We may suspend\nshare repurchase\nactivity at any time.\n\nAt June 30, 2021, we\nhad remaining Board\nauthority to\nrepurchase\napproximately 615\nmillion shares,\nsubject to regulatory\nand legal conditions.\nFor additional\ninformation about\nshare repurchases\nduring second quarter\n2021, see Part II,\nItem 2 in this Report.\n                      \n  Regulatory Matters  \n                      \nThe U.S. financial\nservices industry is\nsubject to significant\nregulation and\nregulatory oversight\ninitiatives. This\nregulation and\noversight may continue\nto impact how U.S.\nfinancial services\ncompanies conduct\nbusiness and may\ncontinue to result in\nincreased regulatory\ncompliance costs.\n\nFor a discussion of\ncertain consent orders\napplicable to the\nCompany, see the\n\u201cOverview\u201d section in\nthis Report. The\nfollowing supplements\nour discussion of the\nother significant\nregulations and\nregulatory oversight\ninitiatives that have\naffected or may affect\nour business contained\nin the \u201cRegulatory\nMatters\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d sections in\nour 2020 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  \u201cLiving Will\u201d Requirements and Related      \n  Matters                                     \n                                              \nRules adopted by the\nFRB and the FDIC under\nthe Dodd-Frank Act\nrequire large\nfinancial\ninstitutions,\nincluding Wells Fargo,\nto prepare and\nperiodically submit\nresolution plans, also\nknown as \u201cliving\nwills,\u201d that would\nfacilitate their rapid\nand orderly resolution\nin the event of\nmaterial financial\ndistress or failure.\nUnder the rules, rapid\nand orderly resolution\nmeans a reorganization\nor liquidation of the\ncovered company under\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode that can be\naccomplished in a\nreasonable period of\ntime and in a manner\nthat substantially\nmitigates the risk\nthat failure would\nhave serious adverse\neffects on the\nfinancial stability of\nthe United States. In\naddition to the\nCompany\u2019s resolution\nplan, our national\nbank subsidiary, Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A. (the\n\u201cBank\u201d), is also\nrequired to prepare\nand periodically\nsubmit a resolution\nplan. If the FRB\nand/or FDIC determine\nthat our resolution\nplan has deficiencies,\nthey may impose more\nstringent capital,\nleverage or liquidity\nrequirements on us or\nrestrict our growth,\nactivities or\noperations until we\nadequately remedy the\ndeficiencies. If the\nFRB and/or FDIC\nultimately determine\nthat we have been\nunable to remedy any\ndeficiencies, they\ncould require us to\ndivest certain assets\nor operations. On June\n29, 2021, we submitted\nour most recent\nresolution plan to the\nFRB and FDIC.\n\nIf Wells Fargo were to\nfail, it may be\nresolved in a\nbankruptcy proceeding\nor, if certain\nconditions are met,\nunder the resolution\nregime created by the\nDodd-Frank Act known\nas the \u201corderly\nliquidation\nauthority.\u201d The\norderly liquidation\nauthority allows for\nthe appointment of the\nFDIC as receiver for a\nsystemically\n\nimportant financial\ninstitution that is in\ndefault or in danger\nof default if, among\nother things, the\nresolution of the\ninstitution under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code\nwould have serious\nadverse effects on\nfinancial stability in\nthe United States. If\nthe FDIC is appointed\nas receiver for Wells\nFargo & Company (the\n\u201cParent\u201d), then the\norderly liquidation\nauthority, rather than\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode, would determine\nthe powers of the\nreceiver and the\nrights and obligations\nof our security\nholders. The FDIC\u2019s\norderly liquidation\nauthority requires\nthat security holders\nof a company in\nreceivership bear all\nlosses before U.S.\ntaxpayers are exposed\nto any losses, and\nallows the FDIC to\ndisregard the strict\npriority of creditor\nclaims under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code in\ncertain circumstances.\n\nThe strategy described\nin our most recent\nresolution plan is a\nsingle point of entry\nstrategy, in which the\nParent would likely be\nthe only material\nlegal entity to enter\nresolution\nproceedings. However,\nwe are not obligated\nto maintain a single\npoint of entry\nstrategy, and the\nstrategy described in\nour resolution plan is\nnot binding in the\nevent of an actual\nresolution of Wells\nFargo, whether\nconducted under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code\nor by the FDIC under\nthe orderly\nliquidation authority.\nThe FDIC has announced\nthat a single point of\nentry strategy may be\na desirable strategy\nunder its\nimplementation of the\norderly liquidation\nauthority, but not all\naspects of how the\nFDIC might exercise\nthis authority are\nknown and additional\nrulemaking is\npossible.\n\nTo facilitate the\norderly resolution of\nsystemically important\nfinancial institutions\nin case of material\ndistress or failure,\nfederal banking\nregulations require\nthat institutions,\nsuch as Wells Fargo,\nmaintain a minimum\namount of equity and\nunsecured debt to\nabsorb losses and\nrecapitalize operating\nsubsidiaries. Federal\nbanking regulators\nhave also required\nmeasures to facilitate\nthe continued\noperation of operating\nsubsidiaries\nnotwithstanding the\nfailure of their\nparent companies, such\nas limitations on\nparent guarantees, and\nhave issued guidance\nencouraging\ninstitutions to take\nlegally binding\nmeasures to provide\ncapital and liquidity\nresources to certain\nsubsidiaries to\nfacilitate an orderly\nresolution. In\nresponse to the\nregulators\u2019 guidance\nand to facilitate the\norderly resolution of\nthe Company, on June\n28, 2017, the Parent\nentered into a support\nagreement, as amended\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    57  \n                               \n                                              \n  Regulatory Matters(continued)               \n                                              \nand restated on June\n26, 2019 (the \u201cSupport\nAgreement\u201d), with WFC\nHoldings, LLC, an\nintermediate holding\ncompany and subsidiary\nof the Parent (the\n\u201cIHC\u201d), the Bank,\nWells Fargo\nSecurities, LLC\n(\u201cWFS\u201d), Wells Fargo\nClearing Services, LLC\n(\u201cWFCS\u201d), and certain\nother subsidiaries of\nthe Parent designated\nfrom time to time as\nmaterial entities for\nresolution planning\npurposes (the \u201cCovered\nEntities\u201d) or\nidentified from time\nto time as related\nsupport entities in\nour resolution plan\n(the \u201cRelated Support\nEntities\u201d). Pursuant\nto the Support\nAgreement, the Parent\ntransferred a\nsignificant amount of\nits assets, including\nthe majority of its\ncash, deposits, liquid\nsecurities and\nintercompany loans\n(but excluding its\nequity interests in\nits subsidiaries and\ncertain other assets),\nto the IHC and will\ncontinue to transfer\nthose types of assets\nto the IHC from time\nto time. In the event\nof our material\nfinancial distress or\nfailure, the IHC will\nbe obligated to use\nthe transferred assets\nto provide capital\nand/or liquidity to\nthe Bank, WFS, WFCS,\nand the Covered\nEntities pursuant to\nthe Support Agreement.\nUnder the Support\nAgreement, the IHC\nwill also provide\nfunding and liquidity\nto the Parent through\nsubordinated notes and\na committed line of\ncredit, which,\ntogether with the\nissuance of dividends,\nis expected to provide\nthe Parent, during\nbusiness as usual\noperating conditions,\nwith the same access\nto cash necessary to\nservice its debts, pay\ndividends, repurchase\nits shares, and\nperform its other\nobligations as it\nwould have had if it\nhad not entered into\nthese arrangements and\ntransferred any\nassets. If certain\nliquidity and/or\ncapital metrics fall\nbelow defined\ntriggers, or if the\nParent\u2019s board of\ndirectors authorizes\nit to file a case\nunder the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code, the\nsubordinated notes\nwould be forgiven, the\ncommitted line of\ncredit would\nterminate, and the\nIHC\u2019s ability to pay\ndividends to the\nParent would be\nrestricted, any of\nwhich could materially\nand adversely impact\nthe Parent\u2019s liquidity\nand its ability to\nsatisfy its debts and\nother obligations, and\ncould result in the\ncommencement of\nbankruptcy proceedings\nby the Parent at an\nearlier time than\nmight have otherwise\noccurred if the\nSupport Agreement were\nnot implemented. The\nrespective obligations\nunder the Support\nAgreement of the\nParent, the IHC, the\nBank, and the Related\nSupport Entities are\nsecured pursuant to a\nrelated security\nagreement.\n\nIn addition to our\nresolution plans, we\nmust also prepare and\nsubmit to the FRB a\nrecovery plan that\nidentifies a range of\noptions that we may\nconsider during times\nof idiosyncratic or\nsystemic economic\nstress to remedy any\nfinancial weaknesses\nand restore market\nconfidence without\nextraordinary\ngovernment support.\nRecovery options\ninclude the possible\nsale, transfer or\ndisposal of assets,\nsecurities, loan\nportfolios or\nbusinesses. The Bank\nmust also prepare and\nsubmit to the OCC a\nrecovery plan that\nsets forth the Bank\u2019s\nplan to remain a going\nconcern when the Bank\nis experiencing\nconsiderable financial\nor operational stress,\nbut has not yet\ndeteriorated to the\npoint where\nliquidation or\nresolution is\nimminent. If either\nthe FRB or the OCC\ndetermines that our\nrecovery plan is\ndeficient, they may\nimpose fines,\nrestrictions on our\nbusiness or ultimately\nrequire us to divest\nassets.\n                               \n  58    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \n                                \n  Critical Accounting Policies  \n                                \nOur significant\naccounting policies\n(see Note 1 (Summary\nof Significant\nAccounting Policies)\nto Financial\nStatements in our 2020\nForm 10-K) are\nfundamental to\nunderstanding our\nresults of operations\nand financial\ncondition because they\nrequire that we use\nestimates and\nassumptions that may\naffect the value of\nour assets or\nliabilities and\nfinancial results.

We provide\nbanking, investment and mortgage products and\nservices, as well as consumer and commercial\nfinance, through banking locations and\noffices, the internet and other distribution\nchannels to individuals, businesses and\ninstitutions in all 50 states, the District of\nColumbia, and in countries outside the U.S.\nWhen we refer to \u201cWells Fargo,\u201d \u201cthe Company,\u201d\n\u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus,\u201d we mean Wells Fargo &\nCompany and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells\nFargo & Company (the Parent) is a financial\nholding company and a bank holding company. We\nalso hold a majority interest in a real estate\ninvestment trust, which has publicly traded\npreferred stock outstanding. Our accounting\nand reporting policies conform with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP) and practices in the financial services\nindustry. For discussion of our significant\naccounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 (2020 Form 10-K). To prepare\nthe financial statements in conformity with\nGAAP, management must make estimates based on\nassumptions about future economic and market\nconditions (for example, unemployment, market\nliquidity, real estate prices, etc.) that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements, income and expenses during the\nreporting period and the related disclosures.\nAlthough our estimates contemplate current\nconditions and how we expect them to change in\nthe future, it is reasonably possible that\nactual conditions could be worse than\nanticipated in those estimates, which could\nmaterially affect our results of operations\nand financial condition. Management has made\nsignificant estimates in several areas,\nincluding: \u2022 allowance for credit losses (Note\n4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit\nLosses)); \u2022 valuations of residential mortgage\nservicing rights (MSRs) (Note 8\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities) and Note 9 (Mortgage Banking\nActivities)); \u2022 valuations of financial\ninstruments (Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets\nand Liabilities)); \u2022 liabilities for\ncontingent litigation losses (Note 13 (Legal\nActions)); \u2022 income taxes; and \u2022 goodwill\nimpairment (Note 10 (Intangible Assets)).\nActual results could differ from those\nestimates. These unaudited interim financial\nstatements reflect all adjustments that are,\nin the opinion of management, necessary for a\nfair statement of the results for the periods\npresented. These adjustments are of a normal\nrecurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed\nin this Form 10-Q. The results of operations\nin the interim financial statements do not\nnecessarily indicate the results that may be\nexpected for the full year. The interim\nfinancial information should be read in\nconjunction with our 2020 Form 10-K. Change in\nAccounting Policies In second quarter 2021, we\nelected to change our accounting method for\nlow-income housing tax credit (LIHTC)\ninvestments from the equity method of\naccounting to the proportional amortization\nmethod. Under the proportional amortization\nmethod, the investments are carried at\namortized cost and amortized in proportion to\nthe tax credits received. The amortization of\nthe investments and the related tax impacts\nare recognized in income tax expense.\nPreviously, we recognized the amortization of\nthe investments in other noninterest income\nand the related tax impacts were recognized in\nincome tax expense. We determined that the\nproportional amortization method is preferable\nbecause it better aligns the financial\nstatement presentation with the economic\nimpact of these investments, which generate\ntax credits over the lives of the investments.\nAdoption of the proportional amortization\nmethod was applied retrospectively, to the\nearliest period presented, which resulted in a\ncumulative-effect adjustment to reduce\nretained earnings by $ 283million as of\nJanuary 1, 2020. In second quarter 2021, we\nalso elected to change the presentation of\ninvestment tax credits related to solar energy\ninvestments, which are accounted for under the\ndeferral method. We reclassified the\ninvestment tax credits on our consolidated\nbalance sheet from accrued expenses and other\nliabilities to a reduction of the carrying\nvalue of the investment balances. We also\nreclassified the investment tax credits, which\nare recognized over time, from income tax\nexpense to interest income for solar energy\nleases or noninterest income for solar energy\nequity investments. We determined that this\npresentation is preferable because it better\nreflects the financial statement presentation\nof the investment tax credits as an integral\ncomponent of the investments. The change in\naccounting policy was adopted retrospectively\nto January 1, 2020. Table 1.1 presents the\nimpact of the accounting policy changes for\nLIHTC investments and solar energy investments\nto our consolidated statement of income and\nconsolidated balance sheet.

The Update also\nclarifies other aspects of the relief provided\nin Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)\n848. We adopted this Update in first quarter\n2021 on a prospective basis, and the guidance\nwill be followed until the Update terminates\non December 31, 2022. The Update did not have\na material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial statements. ASU 2020-08 clarifies\nthe accounting for purchased callable debt\nsecurities carried at a premium and was issued\nto correct an unintended application of ASU\n2017-08 \u2013 Receivables\u2014Nonrefundable Fees and\nOther Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium\nAmortization on Purchased Callable Debt\nSecurities , which requires amortization of\nsuch premiums to the earliest call date, but\nwas not clear for the method to be used for\ninstruments with multiple call dates. The\nUpdate now specifies that such premiums are\namortized to the next call date and requires\nreassessment throughout the life of the\ninstruments with multiple call dates. We\nadopted this Update in first quarter 2021. The\nUpdate did not have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. ASU 2020-01\nclarifies the accounting for equity securities\nupon transition between the measurement\nalternative and equity method. The Update also\nclarifies for forward contracts and options to\npurchase equity securities an entity need not\nconsider whether upon settlement of the\nforward contract or option if the equity\nsecurities would be accounted for by the\nequity method or the fair value option. We\nadopted this Update in first quarter 2021. The\nUpdate did not have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. ASU 2019-12\nprovides narrow scope simplifications and\nimprovements to the general principles in ASC\nTopic 740 \u2013 Income Taxes related to\nintraperiod tax allocation, basis differences\nwhen there are changes in ownership of foreign\ninvestments and interim periods income tax\naccounting for year to date losses that exceed\nanticipated annual losses.

The credit quality\nindicators that we most closely monitor\ninclude credit ratings and delinquency status\nand are based on information as of our\nfinancial statement date. CREDIT RATINGS\nCredit ratings express opinions about the\ncredit quality of a debt security. We\ndetermine the credit rating of a security\naccording to the lowest credit rating made\navailable by national recognized statistical\nrating organizations (NRSROs). Debt securities\nrated investment grade, that is those with\nratings similar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as\ndefined by NRSROs, are generally considered by\nthe rating agencies and market participants to\nbe low credit risk. Conversely, debt\nsecurities rated below investment grade,\nlabeled as \u201cspeculative grade\u201d by the rating\nagencies, are considered to be distinctively\nhigher credit risk than investment grade debt\nsecurities. For debt securities not rated by\nNRSROs, we determine an internal credit grade\nof the debt securities (used for credit risk\nmanagement purposes) equivalent to the credit\nratings assigned by major credit agencies.\nSubstantially all of our debt securities were\nrated by NRSROs at June 30, 2021, and December\n31, 2020.

are\ndelinquent in payment of amounts due under\ncontractual debt agreements have a higher\nprobability of recognition of credit losses.\nAs such, as part of our monitoring of the\ncredit quality of the debt security portfolio,\nwe consider whether debt securities we own are\npast due in payment of principal or interest\npayments and whether any securities have been\nplaced into nonaccrual status. Debt securities\nthat are past due and still accruing were\ninsignificant at both June 30, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020. The carrying value of debt\nsecurities in nonaccrual status was\ninsignificant at both June 30, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020. Charge-offs on debt\nsecurities were insignificant in the second\nquarter and first half of both 2021 and 2020.\nPurchased debt securities with credit\ndeterioration (PCD) are not considered to be\nin nonaccrual status, as payments from issuers\nof these securities remain current. PCD\nsecurities were insignificant in the second\nquarter and first half of both 2021 and 2020.\n                               \n  76    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nUnrealized Losses of Available-for-Sale Debt\nSecurities Table 3.5 shows the gross\nunrealized losses and fair value of AFS debt\nsecurities by length of time those individual\nsecurities in each category have been in a\ncontinuous loss position.

We\ngenerally require a\nfee to extend such\ncommitments. Certain\ncommitments are\nsubject to loan\nagreements with\ncovenants regarding\nthe financial\nperformance of the\ncustomer or borrowing\nbase formulas on an\nongoing basis that\nmust be met before we\nare required to fund\nthe commitment. We may\nreduce or cancel\nconsumer commitments,\nincluding home equity\nlines and credit card\nlines, in accordance\nwith the contracts and\napplicable law. For\nunconditionally\ncancelable commitments\nat our discretion, we\ndo not recognize an\nACL. We may, as a\nrepresentative for\nother lenders, advance\nfunds or provide for\nthe issuance of\nletters of credit\nunder syndicated loan\nor letter of credit\nagreements. Any\nadvances are generally\nrepaid in less than a\nweek and would\nnormally require\ndefault of both the\ncustomer and another\nlender to expose us to\nloss. The unfunded\namount of these\ntemporary advance\narrangements totaled\napproximately $\n82.6billion at June\n30, 2021. We issue\ncommercial letters of\ncredit to assist\ncustomers in\npurchasing goods or\nservices, typically\nfor international\ntrade. At June 30,\n2021, and December 31,\n2020, we had $\n1.4billion and $\n1.3billion,\nrespectively, of\noutstanding issued\ncommercial letters of\ncredit. We also\noriginate multipurpose\nlending commitments\nunder which borrowers\nhave the option to\ndraw on the facility\nfor different purposes\nin one of several\nforms, including a\nstandby letter of\ncredit. See Note 11\n(Guarantees and Other\nCommitments) for\nadditional information\non standby letters of\ncredit. When we enter\ninto commitments, we\nare exposed to credit\nrisk. The maximum\ncredit risk for these\ncommitments will\ngenerally be lower\nthan the contractual\namount because a\nsignificant portion of\nthese commitments are\nnot funded. We manage\nthe potential risk in\ncommitments to lend by\nlimiting the total\namount of commitments,\nboth by individual\ncustomer and in total,\nby monitoring the size\nand maturity structure\nof these commitments\nand by applying the\nsame credit standards\nfor these commitments\nas for all of our\ncredit activities.\n\nFor loans and\ncommitments to lend,\nwe generally require\ncollateral or a\nguarantee. We may\nrequire various types\nof collateral,\nincluding commercial\nand consumer real\nestate, autos, other\nshort-term liquid\nassets such as\naccounts receivable or\ninventory and long-\nlived assets, such as\nequipment and other\nbusiness assets.\nCollateral\nrequirements for each\nloan or commitment may\nvary based on the loan\nproduct and our\nassessment of a\ncustomer\u2019s credit risk\naccording to the\nspecific credit\nunderwriting,\nincluding credit terms\nand structure.\nThe contractual amount\nof our unfunded credit\ncommitments, including\nunissued standby and\ncommercial letters of\ncredit, is summarized\nby portfolio segment\nand class of financing\nreceivable in Table\n4.4.

The\nfollowing sections provide the credit quality\nindicators we most closely monitor. The credit\nquality indicators are generally based on\ninformation as of our financial statement\ndate, with the exception of updated Fair Isaac\nCorporation (FICO) scores and updated loan-to-\nvalue (LTV)/combined LTV (CLTV). We obtain\nFICO scores at loan origination and the scores\nare generally updated at least quarterly,\nexcept in limited circumstances, including\ncompliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act\n(FCRA). Generally, the LTV and CLTV indicators\nare updated in the second month of each\nquarter, with updates no older than March 31,\n2021. COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS We\nmanage a consistent process for assessing\ncommercial loan credit quality. Commercial\nloans are generally subject to individual risk\nassessment using our internal borrower and\ncollateral quality ratings, which is our\nprimary credit quality indicator.

principal balance to the property\u2019s\ncollateral value. CLTV refers to the\ncombination of first lien mortgage and junior\nlien mortgage (including unused line amounts\nfor credit line products) ratios. LTVs and\nCLTVs are updated quarterly using a cascade\napproach which first uses values provided by\nautomated valuation models (AVMs) for the\nproperty. If an AVM is not available, then the\nvalue is estimated using the original\nappraised value adjusted by the change in Home\nPrice Index (HPI) for the property location.\nIf an HPI is not available, the original\nappraised value is used. The HPI value is\nnormally the only method considered for high\nvalue properties, generally with an original\nvalue of $ 1million or more, as the AVM values\nhave proven less accurate for these\nproperties.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    89  \n                               \nNote 4: Loans and Related Allowance for Credit\nLosses (continued)\nTable 4.11 shows the most updated LTV and CLTV\ndistribution of the residential mortgage \u2013\nfirst lien and residential mortgage \u2013 junior\nlien loan portfolios.

We do not consider loan\nresolutions such as foreclosure or short sale\nto be a TDR. In addition, COVID-related\nmodifications are generally not classified as\nTDRs due to the relief under the CARES Act and\nthe Interagency Statement. For additional\ninformation on the TDR relief, see Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies)\nin our 2020 Form 10-K. We may require some\nconsumer borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty to make trial payments generally\nfor a period of three to four months,\naccording to the terms of a planned permanent\nmodification, to determine if they can perform\naccording to those terms. These arrangements\nrepresent trial modifications, which we\nclassify and account for as TDRs. While loans\nare in trial payment programs, their original\nterms are not considered modified and they\ncontinue to advance through delinquency status\nand accrue interest according to their\noriginal terms. Commitments to lend additional\nfunds on loans whose terms have been modified\nin a TDR amounted to $ 344million and $\n489million at June 30, 2021, and December 31,\n2020, respectively. Table 4.14 summarizes our\nTDR modifications for the periods presented by\nprimary modification type and includes the\nfinancial effects of these modifications. For\nthose loans that modify more than once, the\ntable reflects each modification that occurred\nduring the period. Loans that both modify and\nare paid off or written-off within the period,\nas well as changes in recorded investment\nduring the period for loans modified in prior\nperiods, are not included in the table.\n                               \n  92    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 4.14: TDR Modifications\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(continued on following page)\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    93  \n                               \nNote 4: Loans and Related Allowance for Credit\nLosses (continued)\n\n(continued from previous page)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Amounts represent the recorded investment\nin loans after recognizing the effects of the\nTDR, if any. TDRs may have multiple types of\nconcessions, but are presented only once in\nthe first modification type based on the order\npresented in the table above. The reported\namounts include loans remodified of $\n202million and $ 221million for the quarters\nended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively,\nand $ 458million and $ 484million for the\nfirst half of 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n(2) Other concessions include loans with\npayment (principal and/or interest) deferral,\nloans discharged in bankruptcy, loan renewals,\nterm extensions and other interest and\nnoninterest adjustments, but exclude\nmodifications that also forgive principal\nand/or reduce the contractual interest rate.\nThe reported amounts include COVID-related\npayment deferrals that are new TDRs and\nexclude COVID-related payment deferrals\npreviously reported as TDRs given limited\ncurrent financial effects other than payment\ndeferral.\n\n(3) Charge-offs include write-downs of the\ninvestment in the loan in the period it is\ncontractually modified. The amount of charge-\noff will differ from the modification terms if\nthe loan has been charged down prior to the\nmodification based on our policies. In\naddition, there may be cases where we have a\ncharge-off/down with no legal principal\nmodification.\n\n(4) Recorded investment related to interest\nrate reduction reflects the effect of reduced\ninterest rates on loans with an interest rate\nconcession as one of their concession types,\nwhich includes loans reported as a principal\nprimary modification type that also have an\ninterest rate concession.\n\n(5) Trial modifications are granted a delay in\npayments due under the original terms during\nthe trial payment period. However, these loans\ncontinue to advance through delinquency status\nand accrue interest according to their\noriginal terms. Any subsequent permanent\nmodification generally includes interest rate\nrelated concessions; however, the exact\nconcession type and resulting financial effect\nare usually not known until the loan is\npermanently modified. Trial modifications for\nthe period are presented net of previously\nreported trial modifications that became\npermanent in the current period.\n                               \n  94    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 4.15 summarizes permanent modification\nTDRs that have defaulted in the current period\nwithin 12 months of their permanent\nmodification date.

we\nenter into various types of on- and off-\nbalance sheet transactions with special\npurpose entities (SPEs), which are\ncorporations, trusts, limited liability\ncompanies or partnerships that are established\nfor a limited purpose. SPEs are often formed\nin connection with securitization transactions\nwhereby financial assets are transferred to an\nSPE. SPEs formed in connection with\nsecuritization transactions are generally\nconsidered variable interest entities (VIEs).\nThe VIE may alter the risk profile of the\nasset by entering into derivative transactions\nor obtaining credit support, and issues\nvarious forms of interests in those assets to\ninvestors. When we transfer financial assets\nfrom our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE\nin connection with a securitization, we\ntypically receive cash and sometimes other\ninterests in the VIE as proceeds for the\nassets we transfer. In certain transactions\nwith VIEs, we may retain the right to service\nthe transferred assets and repurchase the\ntransferred assets if the outstanding balance\nof the assets falls below the level at which\nthe cost to service the assets exceed the\nbenefits. In addition, we may purchase the\nright to service loans transferred to a VIE by\na third party. In connection with our\nsecuritization or other VIE activities, we\nhave various forms of ongoing involvement with\nVIEs, which may include: \u2022 underwriting\nsecurities issued by VIEs and subsequently\nmaking markets in those securities; \u2022\nproviding credit enhancement on securities\nissued by VIEs through the use of letters of\ncredit or financial guarantees; \u2022 entering\ninto other derivative contracts with VIEs; \u2022\nholding senior or subordinated interests in\nVIEs; \u2022 acting as servicer or investment\nmanager for VIEs; \u2022 providing administrative\nor trustee services to VIEs; and \u2022 providing\nseller financing to VIEs. Loan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity We periodically\ntransfer consumer and commercial loans and\nother types of financial assets in\nsecuritization and whole loan sale\ntransactions. MORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S.\nGOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS\nWITH GINNIE MAE In the normal course of\nbusiness we sell originated and purchased\nresidential and commercial mortgage loans to\ngovernment-sponsored entities (GSEs). These\nloans are generally transferred into\nsecuritizations sponsored by the GSEs, which\nprovide certain credit guarantees to investors\nand servicers. We also transfer mortgage loans\ninto securitizations pursuant to Government\nNational Mortgage Association (GNMA)\nguidelines which are insured by the Federal\nHousing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\nMortgage loans eligible for securitization\nwith the GSEs or GNMA are considered\nconforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA design the\nstructure of these securitizations, sponsor\nthe involved VIEs, and have power over the\nactivities most significant to the VIE. We\naccount for loans transferred in conforming\nmortgage loan securitization transactions as\nsales and do not consolidate the VIEs as we\nare not the primary beneficiary. In exchange\nfor the transfer of loans, we typi cally\nreceive securities issued by the VIEs which we\nsell to third parties for cash or hold for\ninvestment purposes as HTM or AFS securities.\nWe also retain servicing rights on the\ntransferred loans. As a servicer, we retain\nthe option to repurchase loans from GNMA loan\nsecuritization pools, which becomes\nexercisable when three scheduled loan payments\nremain unpaid by the borrower. We repurchased\nloans of $ 1.0billion and $ 2.9billion, during\nthe second quarter and first half of 2021,\nrespectively, and $ 3.6billion and $\n5.1billion during the second quarter and first\nhalf of 2020, respectively, which\npredominantly represented repurchases of\ngovernment insured loans. We recorded assets\nand related liabilities of $ 128million and $\n176million at June 30, 2021, and December 31,\n2020, respectively, where we did not exercise\nour option to repurchase eligible loans. Upon\ntransfers of loans, we also provide\nindemnification for losses incurred due to\nmaterial breaches of contractual\nrepresentations and warranties, as well as\nother recourse arrangements. At June 30, 2021,\nand December 31, 2020, our liability\nassociated with these provisions was $\n201million and $ 221million, respectively, and\nthe maximum exposure to loss was $ 13.4billion\nand $ 13.7billion, respectively. Off-balance\nsheet mortgage loans sold or secu ritized\npresented in Table 8.5 are predominantly loans\nsecuritized by the GSEs and GNMA. See Note 9\n(Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional\ninformation about residential and commercial\nservicing rights, advances and servicing fees.\nSubstantially all residential servicing\nactivity is related to assets transferred to\nGSE and GNMA securitizations. NONCONFORMING\nMORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS In the normal\ncourse of business, we sell nonconforming\nresidential and commercial mortgage loans in\nsecuritization transactions that we design and\nsponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan\nsecuritizations do not involve a government\ncredit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial\ninterest holders are subject to credit risk of\nthe underlying assets held by the\nsecuritization VIE. We typically originate the\ntransferred loans, account for the transfers\nas sales and do not consolidate the VIE. We\nalso typically retain the right to service the\nloans and may hold other beneficial interests\nissued by the VIEs, such as debt securities\nheld for investment purposes. Our servicing\nrole related to nonconforming commercial\nmortgage loan securitizations is limited to\nprimary or master servicer and the most\nsignificant decisions impacting the\nperformance of the VIE are generally made by\nthe special servicer or the controlling class\nsecurity holder. For our residential\nnonconforming mortgage loan securitizations\naccounted for as sales, we either do not hold\nvariable interests that we consider\npotentially significant or are not the primary\nservicer for a majority of the VIE assets.\nWHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We also sell\nwhole loans to VIEs where we have continuing\ninvolvement in the form of financing. We\naccount for these transfers as sales, and do\nnot consolidate the VIEs as we do not have the\npower to direct the most significant\nactivities of the VIEs. Table 8.1 presents\ninformation about transfers of assets during\nthe period for which we recorded the transfers\nas sales and have continuing involvement with\nthe transferred assets. In connection with\nthese transfers, we received proceeds and\nrecorded servicing assets, securities, and\nloans. Substantially all transfers were\nrelated to residential mortgage\nsecuritizations with the GSEs or GNMA and\nresulted in no gain or loss because the loans\nwere already measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. Each of these interests are\ninitially measured at fair value.\n                                \n  100    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nServicing rights are classified as Level 3\nmeasurements, and generally securities are\nclassified as Level 2.\n\nTable 8.1: Transfers with Continuing\nInvolvement\n                                              \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                     2\u2026                2\u2026  \n  \u2026           R\u2026        C\u2026       R\u2026       C\u2026  \n  \u2026           m\u2026        m\u2026       m\u2026       m\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026    $  4\u2026        5\u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       4\u2026        5\u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       3\u2026        54        3        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  4\u2026        24        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       6\u2026        39        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        \u2014         \u2014        \u2014        \u2014      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  8\u2026        8\u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       8\u2026        8\u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       4\u2026        1\u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  8\u2026        71        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1\u2026        68        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       9\u2026         \u2014        \u2014        \u2014      \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(1) Represents cash\nproceeds and the fair\nvalue of non-cash\nbeneficial interests\nrecognized at\nsecuritization\nsettlement.

For the same\nperiods, we received $ 4.0billion and $\n9.8billion in proceeds from the sales,\nrespectively, and recognized $ 147million and\n$ 355million of gains, respectively, which are\nincluded in other noninterest income on our\nconsolidated statement of income. In\nconnection with the sales, we provided $\n1.6billion and $ 3.8billion of collateralized\nloan financing to a third-party sponsored VIE\nin the second quarter and first half of 2021,\nrespectively. The loans are measured at\namortized cost and are classified in loans on\nthe consolidated balance sheet. The collateral\nsupporting our loan includes the student loans\nwe sold. We do not consolidate the VIE as we\ndo not have power over the significant\nactivities of the entity. RESECURITIZATION\nACTIVITIES We enter into resecuritization\ntransactions as part of our trading activities\nto accommodate the investment and risk\nmanagement activities of our customers. In our\nresecuritization transactions, we transfer\ntrading debt securities to VIEs in exchange\nfor new beneficial interests that are sold to\nthird parties at or shortly after\nsecuritization settlement. This activity is\nperformed for customers seeking a specific\nreturn or risk profile. Substantially all of\nour transactions involve the resecuritization\nof conforming mortgage-backed securities\nissued by the GSEs or GNMA. We do not\nconsolidate the resecuritization VIEs as we\nshare in the decision-making power with third\nparties and do not hold significant economic\ninterests in the VIEs other than for market-\nmaking activities.

In accordance with\napplicable servicing guidelines, delinquency\nstatus continues to advance for loans with\nCOVID-related payment deferrals.

For additional information about\nthese VIEs, see the \u201cLoan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity\u201d section within this\nNote. Nonconforming mortgage loan\nsecuritizations also include commercial\nmortgage loan securitizations sponsored by\nthird parties where we did not originate or\ntransfer the loans but serve as master\nservicer and invest in securities that could\nbe potentially significant to the VIE.\nConforming loan securitization and\nresecuritization transactions involving the\nGSEs and GNMA are excluded from Table 8.6\nbecause we are not the sponsor or we do not\nhave power over the activities most\nsignificant to the VIEs. Additionally, due to\nthe nature of the guarantees provided by the\nGSEs and the FHA and VA, our credit risk\nassociated with these VIEs is limited. For\nadditional information about conforming\nmortgage loan securitizations and\nresecuritizations, see the \u201cLoan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity\u201d and \"Resecuritization\nActivities\" sections within this Note. TAX\nCREDIT STRUCTURES We co-sponsor and make\ninvestments in affordable housing and\nsustainable energy projects that are designed\nto generate a return primarily through the\nrealization of federal tax credits. The\nprojects are typically managed by project\nsponsors who have the power over the VIE\u2019s\nassets. In some instances, our investments in\nthese structures may require that we fund\nfuture capital commitments at the discretion\nof the project sponsors. COMMERCIAL REAL\nESTATE LOANS We transfer purchased industrial\ndevelopment bonds and GSE credit enhancements\nto VIEs in exchange for beneficial interests.\nWe own all of the beneficial interests and may\nalso service the underlying mortgages that\nserve as collateral to the bonds. Prior to\nfirst quarter 2021, we consolidated these VIEs\nas we controlled the key decisions. During\nfirst quarter 2021, we amended the structures\nsuch that we no longer control the key\ndecisions of the VIEs. The GSEs have the power\nto direct the servicing and workout activities\nof the VIE in the event of a default. As a\nresult, we deconsolidated the VIEs during\nfirst quarter 2021, and recognized the\nbeneficial interests at fair value on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. OTHER VIE\nSTRUCTURES We engage in various forms of\nstructured finance arrangements with other\nVIEs, including collateralized debt\nobligations, asset-backed finance structures\nand other securitizations collateralized by\nasset classes other than mortgages. Collateral\nmay include rental properties, asset-backed\nsecurities, student loans, mortgage loans and\nauto loans. We may participate in structuring\nor marketing the arrangements, as well as\nprovide financing, service one or more of the\nunderlying assets, or enter into derivatives\nwith the VIEs. We may also receive fees for\nthose services. We are not the primary\nbeneficiary of these structures because we do\nnot have power to direct the most significant\nactivities of the VIEs.\n                                \n  102    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nTable 8.6 provides a summary of our exposure\nto the unconsolidated VIEs described above,\nwhich includes investments in securities,\nloans, guarantees, liquidity agreements,\ncommitments and certain derivatives. We\nexclude certain transactions with\nunconsolidated VIEs when our continuing\ninvolvement is temporary or administrative in\nnature or insignificant in size. In Table 8.6,\n\u201cTotal VIE assets\u201d represents the remaining\nprincipal balance of assets held by\nunconsolidated VIEs using the most current\ninformation available. For VIEs that obtain\nexposure to assets synthetically through\nderivative instruments, the notional amount of\nthe derivative is included in the asset\nbalance. \u201cCarrying value\u201d is the amount in our\nconsolidated balance sheet related to our\ninvolvement with the unconsolidated VIEs.\n\u201cMaximum exposure to loss\u201d is determined as\nthe carrying value of our investment in the\nVIEs excluding the unconditional repurchase\noptions that have not been exercised, plus the\nremaining undrawn liquidity and lending\ncommitments, the notional amount of net\nwritten derivative contracts, and generally\nthe notional amount of, or stressed loss\nestimate for, other commitments and\nguarantees. Debt, guarantees and other\ncommitments include amounts related to loans\nsold that we may be required to repurchase, or\notherwise indemnify or reimburse the investor\nor insurer for losses incurred, due to\nmaterial breach of contractual representations\nand warranties as well as other retained\nrecourse arrangements. The maximum exposure to\nloss for material breach of contractual\nrepresentations and warranties represents a\nstressed case estimate we utilize for\ndetermining stressed case regulatory capital\nneeds and is considered to be a remote\nscenario. \u201cMaximum exposure to loss\u201d\nrepresents estimated loss that would be\nincurred under severe, hypothetical\ncircumstances, for which we believe the\npossibility is extremely remote, such as where\nthe value of our interests and any associated\ncollateral declines to zero, without any\nconsideration of recovery or offset from any\neconomic hedges. Accordingly, this disclosure\nis not an indication of expected loss.\nTable 8.6: Unconsolidated VIEs\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Includes $ 317million and $ 310million of\nsecurities classified as trading at June 30,\n2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n(2) All other assets includes mortgage\nservicing rights, derivative assets, and other\nassets (predominantly servicing advances).\n(3) In second quarter 2021, we elected to\nchange our accounting method for low-income\nhousing tax credit investments. Prior period\nbalances have been revised to conform with the\ncurrent period presentation. For additional\ninformation, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies).\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    103  \n                                \nNote 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities (continued)\n\nConsolidated VIEs We consolidate VIEs where we\nare the primary beneficiary. We are the\nprimary beneficiary of the following structure\ntypes: COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND\nLEASES We securitize dealer floor plan loans\nand leases in a revolving master trust entity\nand hold the subordinated notes and residual\nequity interests. As servicer and residual\ninterest holder, we control the key decisions\nof the trust and consolidate the entity. The\ntotal VIE assets held by the master trust\nrepresent a majority of the total VIE assets\npresented for this category in Table 8.7. In a\nseparate transaction structure, we also\nprovide the majority of debt and equity\nfinancing to an SPE that engages in lending\nand leasing to specific vendors and service\nthe underlying collateral. OTHER VIE\nSTRUCTURES Other VIEs are primarily related to\nmunicipal tender option bond (MTOB)\ntransactions and nonconforming mortgage loan\nsecuritizations that we sponsor. MTOBs are\nvehicles to finance the purchase of municipal\nbonds through the issuance of short-term debt\nto investors. Our involvement with MTOBs\nincludes serving as the residual interest\nholder, which provides control over the key\ndecisions of the VIE, as well as the\nremarketing agent or liquidity provider\nrelated to the debt issued to investors. We\nalso securitize nonconforming mortgage loans,\nin which our involvement includes servicer of\nthe underlying assets and holder of\nsubordinate or senior securities issued by the\nVIE. Table 8.7 presents a summary of financial\nassets and liabilities of our consolidated\nVIEs. The carrying value represents assets and\nliabilities recorded on our consolidated\nbalance sheet. Carrying values of assets are\npresented using GAAP measurement methods,\nwhich may include fair value, credit\nimpairment or other adjustments, and therefore\nin some instances will differ from \u201cTotal VIE\nassets.\u201d For VIEs that obtain exposure\nsynthetically through derivative instruments,\nthe notional amount of the derivative is\nincluded in \u201cTotal VIE assets.\u201d On our\nconsolidated balance sheet, we separately\ndisclose (1) the consolidated assets of\ncertain VIEs that can only be used to settle\nthe liabilities of those VIEs, and (2) the\nconsolidated liabilities of certain VIEs for\nwhich the VIE creditors do not have recourse\nto Wells Fargo.\n\nTable 8.7: Transactions with Consolidated VIEs\n                                              \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2013                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n             \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n             \u2014      \u2014      \u2014      \u2014      \u2014    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2014    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) Includes $\n117million and $\n269million of\nsecurities classified\nas trading at June 30,\n2021, and December 31,\n2020, respectively.\n\n(2) All other assets\nincludes cash and due\nfrom banks, Interest-\nearning deposits with\nbanks, derivative\nassets, equity\nsecurities, and other\nassets.\n\n(3) All other\nliabilities includes\nshort-term borrowings,\nderivative\nliabilities, and\naccrued expenses and\nother liabilities.\n\n(4) For structure\ndescription, see the\n\"Transactions with\nUnconsolidated VIEs\"\nsection within this\nNote. These\nconsolidated VIEs were\ndeconsolidated in\nfirst quarter 2021.\n\nOther Transactions In\naddition to the\ntransactions included\nin the previous\ntables, we have used\nwholly-owned trust\npreferred security\nVIEs to issue debt\nsecurities or\npreferred equity\nexclusively to third-\nparty investors. As\nthe sole assets of the\nVIEs are receivables\nfrom us, we do not\nconsolidate the VIEs\neven though we own all\nof the voting equity\nshares of the VIEs,\nhave fully guaranteed\nthe obligations of the\nVIEs, and may have the\nright to redeem the\nthird-party securities\nunder certain\ncircumstances. In our\nconsolidated balance\nsheet we reported the\ndebt securities issued\nto the VIEs as long-\nterm junior\nsubordinated debt with\na carrying value of $\n381million and $\n704million at June 30,\n2021, and December 31,\n2020, respectively. In\nsecond quarter 2021,\nwe liquidated certain\nof our trust preferred\nsecurity VIEs. As part\nof these liquidations,\nthe preferred\nsecurities issued by\nthe trusts were\ncanceled and junior\nsubordinated\ndebentures with a\ntotal carrying value\nof $ 332million were\ndistributed to the\npreferred security\nholders. See Note 16\n(Preferred Stock) for\nadditional information\nabout trust preferred\nsecurities.\n\nCertain money market\nfunds are also\nexcluded from the\nprevious tables\nbecause they are\nexempt from the\nconsolidation\nanalysis. We\nvoluntarily waived a\nportion of our\nmanagement fees for\nthese money market\nfunds to maintain a\nminimum level of daily\nnet investment income.\nThe amount of fees\nwaived was\ninsignificant in the\nsecond quarter and\nfirst half of both\n2021 and 2020.\n                                \n  104    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \n                                      \n  Note 9:Mortgage Banking Activities  \n                                      \nMortgage banking activities consist of\nresidential and commercial mortgage\noriginations, sales and servicing. We apply\nthe amortization method to commercial MSRs and\napply the fair value method to residential\nMSRs.

The credit risk\nrelated to these advances is limited since the\nreimbursement is generally senior to cash\npayments to investors. We also advance\npayments of taxes and insurance for our owned\nloans which are collectible from the borrower.\nWe maintain an allowance for uncollectible\namounts for advances on loans serviced for\nothers that may not be reimbursed if the\npayments were not made in accordance with\napplicable servicing agreements or if the\ninsurance or servicing agreements contain\nlimitations on reimbursements. Servicing\nadvances on owned loans are charged-off when\ndeemed uncollectible.

Estimated\nmaximum exposure to loss was $ 210million and\n$ 1.4billion with related collateral of $\n2.1billion and $ 1.2billion as of June 30,\n2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n\u201cMaximum exposure to loss\u201d and \u201cNon-investment\ngrade\u201d are required disclosures under GAAP.\nMaximum exposure to loss represents the\nestimated loss that would be incurred under an\nassumed hypothetical circumstance, despite\nwhat we believe is a remote possibility, where\nthe value of our interests and any associated\ncollateral declines to zero. Maximum exposure\nto loss estimates in Table 11.1 do not reflect\neconomic hedges or collateral we could use to\noffset or recover losses we may incur under\nour guarantee agreements. Accordingly, this\nrequired disclosure is not an indication of\nexpected loss. We believe the carrying value\nis more representative of our exposure to loss\nthan maximum exposure to loss. The carrying\nvalue represents the fair value of the\nguarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL\nfor guarantees, if applicable. Non-investment\ngrade represents those guarantees on which we\nhave a higher risk of performance under the\nterms of the guarantee. If the underlying\nassets under the guarantee are non-investment\ngrade (that is, an external rating that is\nbelow investment grade or an internal credit\ndefault grade that is equivalent to a below\ninvestment grade external rating), we consider\nthe risk of performance to be high. Internal\ncredit default grades are determined based\nupon the same credit policies that we use to\nevaluate the risk of payment or performance\nwhen making loans and other extensions of\ncredit. Credit quality indicators we usually\nconsider in evaluating risk of payments or\nperformance are described in Note 4 (Loans and\nRelated Allowance for Credit Losses). MERCHANT\nPROCESSING SERVICES We provide debit and\ncredit card transaction processing services\nthrough payment networks directly for\nmerchants and as a sponsor for merchant\nprocessing servicers, including our joint\nventure with a third party that is accounted\nfor as an equity method investment. In our\nrole as the merchant acquiring bank, we have a\npotential obligation in connection with\npayment and delivery disputes between the\nmerchant and the cardholder that are resolved\nin favor of the cardholder. If we are unable\nto collect the amounts from the merchant, we\nincur a loss for the refund to the cardholder.\nWe are secondarily obligated to make a refund\nfor transactions involving sponsored merchant\nprocessing servicers. We generally have a low\nlikelihood of loss in connection with our\nmerchant processing services because most\nproducts and services are delivered when\npurchased and amounts are generally refunded\nwhen items are returned to the merchant. In\naddition, we may reduce our risk in connection\nwith these transactions by withholding future\npayments and requiring cash or other\ncollateral. For the first half of 2021, we\nprocessed card transaction volume of $\n790.2billion as a merchant acquiring bank, and\nrelated losses, including those from our joint\nventure entity, were immaterial.\n                                \n  108    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nGUARANTEES OF\nSUBSIDIARIES In the\nnormal course of\nbusiness, the Parent\nmay provide\ncounterparties with\nguarantees related to\nits subsidiaries\u2019\nobligations. These\nobligations are\nincluded in the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated\nbalance sheet or are\nreflected as off-\nbalance sheet\ncommitments, and\ntherefore, the Parent\nhas not recognized a\nseparate liability for\nthese guarantees. The\nParent fully and\nunconditionally\nguarantees the payment\nof principal,\ninterest, and any\nother amounts that may\nbe due on securities\nthat its 100% owned\nfinance subsidiary,\nWells Fargo Finance\nLLC, may issue. These\nsecurities are not\nguaranteed by any\nother subsidiary of\nthe Parent. The\nguaranteed liabilities\nwere $ 1.6billion and\n$ 2.3billion at June\n30, 2021, and December\n31, 2020,\nrespectively. These\nguarantees rank on\nparity with all of the\nParent\u2019s other\nunsecured and\nunsubordinated\nindebtedness. The\nassets of the Parent\nconsist primarily of\nequity in its\nsubsidiaries, and the\nParent is a separate\nand distinct legal\nentity from its\nsubsidiaries. As a\nresult, the Parent\u2019s\nability to address\nclaims of holders of\nthese debt securities\nagainst the Parent\nunder the guarantee\ndepends on the\nParent\u2019s receipt of\ndividends, loan\npayments and other\nfunds from its\nsubsidiaries. If any\nof the Parent\u2019s\nsubsidiaries becomes\ninsolvent, the direct\ncreditors of that\nsubsidiary will have a\nprior claim on that\nsubsidiary\u2019s assets.\nThe rights of the\nParent and the rights\nof the Parent\u2019s\ncreditors will be\nsubject to that prior\nclaim unless the\nParent is also a\ndirect creditor of\nthat subsidiary. For\nadditional information\nregarding other\nrestrictions on the\nParent\u2019s ability to\nreceive dividends,\nloan payments and\nother funds from its\nsubsidiaries, see Note\n23 (Regulatory Capital\nRequirements and Other\nRestrictions).\n\nOTHER COMMITMENTS To\nmeet the financing\nneeds of our\ncustomers, we may\nenter into commitments\nto purchase debt and\nequity securities to\nprovide capital for\ntheir funding,\nliquidity or other\nfuture needs. As of\nboth June 30, 2021,\nand December 31, 2020,\nwe had commitments to\npurchase debt\nsecurities of $\n18million and\ncommitments to\npurchase equity\nsecurities of $\n3.2billion. As part of\nmaintaining our\nmemberships in certain\nclearing\norganizations, we are\nrequired to stand\nready to provide\nliquidity to sustain\nmarket clearing\nactivity in the event\nunforeseen events\noccur or are deemed\nlikely to occur.\nCertain of these\nobligations are\nguarantees of other\nmembers\u2019 performance\nand accordingly are\nincluded in Table 11.1\nin Other guarantees\nand indemnifications.\nAlso, we have\ncommitments to\npurchase loans and\nsecurities under\nresale agreements from\ncertain\ncounterparties,\nincluding central\nclearing\norganizations. The\namount of our unfunded\ncontractual\ncommitments was $\n12.9billion and $\n12.0billion as of June\n30, 2021, and December\n31, 2020,\nrespectively. Given\nthe nature of these\ncommitments, they are\nexcluded from Table\n4.4 (Unfunded Credit\nCommitments) in Note 4\n(Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses).\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    109  \n                                \n                                         \n  Note 12:Pledged Assets and Collateral  \n                                         \nPledged Assets Table 12.1 provides the\ncarrying amount of on-balance sheet pledged\nassets and the fair value of other pledged\ncollateral. Other pledged collateral is\ncollateral we have received from third\nparties, have the right to repledge and is not\nrecognized on our consolidated balance sheet.\nTRADING RELATED ACTIVITY Our trading\nbusinesses may pledge debt and equity\nsecurities in connection with securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase (repurchase\nagreements) and securities lending\narrangements. The collateral that we pledge\nrelated to our trading activities may include\nour own collateral as well as collateral that\nwe have received from third parties and have\nthe right to repledge. All of the collateral\nwe pledge related to trading activity is\neligible to be repledged or sold by the\nsecured party. NON-TRADING RELATED ACTIVITY As\npart of our liquidity management strategy, we\nmay pledge loans, debt securities, and other\nfinancial assets to secure trust and public\ndeposits, borrowings and letters of credit\nfrom the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (FRB) and for other purposes as\nrequired or permitted by law or insurance\nstatutory requirements. Substantially all of\nthe non-trading activity pledged collateral is\nnot eligible to be repledged or sold by the\nsecured party. VIE RELATED We pledge assets in\nconnection with various types of transactions\nentered into with VIEs. These pledged assets\ncan only be used to settle the liabilities of\nthose entities. We also have loans recorded on\nour consolidated balance sheet which represent\ncertain delinquent loans that are eligible for\nrepurchase from GNMA loan securitizations.

These activities are\nconducted through our broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, through\nother bank entities. Our securities financing\nactivities primarily involve high-quality,\nliquid securities such as U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and government agency securities\nand, to a lesser extent, less liquid\nsecurities, including equity securities,\ncorporate bonds and asset-backed securities.\nWe account for these transactions as\ncollateralized financings in which we\ntypically receive or pledge securities as\ncollateral. We believe these financing\ntransactions generally do not have material\ncredit risk given the collateral provided and\nthe related monitoring processes. OFFSETTING\nOF SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES Table 12.2\npresents resale and repurchase agreements\nsubject to master repurchase agreements (MRA)\nand securities borrowing and lending\nagreements subject to master securities\nlending agreements (MSLA). Collateralized\nfinancings, and those with a single\ncounterparty, are presented net on our\nconsolidated balance sheet, provided certain\ncriteria are met that permit balance sheet\nnetting. Substantially all transactions\nsubject to these agreements do not meet those\ncriteria and thus are not eligible for balance\nsheet netting. Collateral we pledged consists\nof non-cash instruments, such as securities or\nloans, and is not netted on the consolidated\nbalance sheet against the related liability.\nCollateral we received includes securities or\nloans and is not recognized on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. Collateral pledged\nor received may be increased or decreased over\ntime to maintain certain contractual\nthresholds, as the assets underlying each\narrangement fluctuate in value. Generally,\nthese agreements require collateral to exceed\nthe asset or liability recognized on\n                                \n  110    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nthe balance sheet. The following table\nincludes the amount of collateral pledged or\nreceived related to exposures subject to\nenforceable MRAs or MSLAs. While these\nagreements are typically over-collateralized,\nU.S. GAAP requires disclosure in this table to\nlimit the reported amount of such collateral\nto the amount of the related recognized asset\nor liability for each counterparty. In\naddition to the amounts included in Table\n12.2, we also have balance sheet netting\nrelated to derivatives that is disclosed in\nNote 14 (Derivatives).\n\nTable 12.2: Offsetting \u2013 Securities Financing\nActivities\n                                              \n                     Jun              Dec     \n  (in                30,              31,     \n  mill\u2026              2021             2020    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Asse\u2026                                       \n  Resa\u2026                                       \n  and                                         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  borr\u2026                                       \n  agre\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026    $  101,\u2026            92,4\u2026          \n  reco\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  offs\u2026                                       \n  in          -13,\u2026            -11,\u2026          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (1)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  in                                          \n  cons\u2026       87,1\u2026            80,9\u2026          \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (2)                                         \n  Coll\u2026                                       \n  not                                         \n  reco\u2026                                       \n  in          -86,\u2026            -80,\u2026          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (3)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026    $    729              775          \n  (4)                                         \n  Liab\u2026                                       \n  Repu\u2026                                       \n  and                                         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  lend\u2026                                       \n  agre\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026    $  47,2\u2026            57,6\u2026          \n  reco\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  offs\u2026                                       \n  in          -13,\u2026            -11,\u2026          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (1)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  in                                          \n  cons\u2026       33,4\u2026            46,1\u2026          \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (5)                                         \n  Coll\u2026                                       \n  pled\u2026                                       \n  but                                         \n  not                                         \n  nett\u2026       -33,\u2026            -45,\u2026          \n  in                                          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (6)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026    $    260              290          \n  (4)                                         \n                                              \n(1) Represents recognized amount of resale and\nrepurchase agreements with counterparties\nsubject to enforceable MRAs that have been\noffset in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n(2) Includes $ 70.1billion and $ 65.6billion\nclassified on our consolidated balance sheet\nin federal funds sold and securities purchased\nunder resale agreements at June 30, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020, respectively.

At June 30, 2021, and December\n31, 2020, we have received total collateral\nwith a fair value of $ 118.9billion and $\n108.5billion, respectively, all of which we\nhave the right to sell or repledge. These\namounts include securities we have sold or\nrepledged to others with a fair value of $\n34.5billion and $ 36.1billion at June 30,\n2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n\n(4) Represents the amount of our exposure\n(assets) or obligation (liabilities) that is\nnot collateralized and/or is not subject to an\nenforceable MRA or MSLA.\n\n(5) Amount is classified in short-term\nborrowings on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n(6) Represents the fair value of collateral we\nhave pledged, related to enforceable MRAs or\nMSLAs, limited in the table above to the\namount of the recognized liability owed to\neach counterparty. At June 30, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020, we have pledged total\ncollateral with a fair value of $ 48.5billion\nand $ 59.2billion, respectively, substantially\nall of which may be sold or repledged by the\ncounterparty.\n\nREPURCHASE AND SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements\nand securities lending arrangements are\neffectively short-term collateralized\nborrowings. In these transactions, we receive\ncash in exchange for transferring securities\nas collateral and recognize an obligation to\nreacquire the securities for cash at the\ntransaction\u2019s maturity. These types of\ntransactions create risks, including (1) the\ncounterparty may fail to return the securities\nat maturity, (2) the fair value of the\nsecurities transferred may decline below the\namount of our obligation to reacquire the\nsecurities, and therefore create an obligation\nfor us to pledge additional amounts, and (3)\nthe counterparty may accelerate the maturity\non demand, requiring us to reacquire the\nsecurity prior to contractual maturity. We\nattempt to mitigate these risks in various\nways. Our collateral primarily consists of\nhighly liquid securities. In addition, we\nunderwrite and monitor the financial strength\nof our counterparties, monitor the fair value\nof collateral pledged relative to\ncontractually required repurchase amounts, and\nmonitor that our collateral is properly\nreturned through the clearing and settlement\nprocess in advance of our cash repayment.\nTable 12.3 provides the gross amounts\nrecognized on the consolidated balance sheet\n(before the effects of offsetting) of our\nliabilities for repurchase and securities\nlending agreements disaggregated by underlying\ncollateral type.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    111  \n                                \nNote 12: Pledged Assets and Collateral\n(continued)\n\nTable 12.3: Gross Obligations by Underlying\nCollateral Type\n                                              \n                      Jun              Dec    \n  (in                 30,              31,    \n  mill\u2026               2021             2020   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Repu\u2026                                       \n  agre\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  U.S.                                        \n  Trea\u2026    $  19,730           22,922         \n  and                                         \n  fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  U.S.                                        \n  Stat\u2026           24                4         \n  and                                         \n  poli\u2026                                       \n  subd\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026        8,029           15,353         \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Non-\u2026                                       \n  mort\u2026          860            1,069         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Corp\u2026                                       \n  debt        10,047            9,944         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Asse\u2026        1,262            1,054         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Equi\u2026          892            1,500         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Other          783              336         \n  Total       41,627           52,182         \n  repu\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  lend\u2026                                       \n  arra\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  U.S.                                        \n  Trea\u2026           42               64         \n  and                                         \n  fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026           31               23         \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Corp\u2026                                       \n  debt            45               79         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Equi\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026        5,422            5,189         \n  (1)                                         \n  Other          114               85         \n  Total                                       \n  secu\u2026        5,654            5,440         \n  lend\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  repu\u2026                                       \n  and      $  47,281           57,622         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  lend\u2026                                       \n                                              \n(1) Equity securities are generally exchange\ntraded and represent collateral received from\nthird parties that has been repledged.

These\nproceedings and investigations include actions\nbrought against Wells Fargo and/or our\nsubsidiaries with respect to corporate-related\nmatters and transactions in which Wells Fargo\nand/or our subsidiaries were involved. In\naddition, Wells Fargo and our subsidiaries may\nbe requested to provide information or\notherwise cooperate with government\nauthorities in the conduct of investigations\nof other persons or industry groups. Although\nthere can be no assurance as to the ultimate\noutcome, Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries\nhave generally denied, or believe we have a\nmeritorious defense and will deny, liability\nin all significant legal actions pending\nagainst us, including the matters described\nbelow, and we intend to defend vigorously each\ncase, other than matters we describe as having\nsettled. We establish accruals for legal\nactions when potential losses associated with\nthe actions become probable and the costs can\nbe reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we\nrecord the amount we consider to be the best\nestimate within a range of potential losses\nthat are both probable and estimable; however,\nif we cannot determine a best estimate, then\nwe record the low end of the range of those\npotential losses. The actual costs of\nresolving legal actions may be substantially\nhigher or lower than the amounts accrued for\nthose actions. ATM ACCESS FEE LITIGATION In\nOctober 2011, plaintiffs filed a putative\nclass action, Mackmin, et al. v. Visa, Inc. et\nal. , against Wells Fargo & Company, Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A., Visa, MasterCard, and\nseveral other banks in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia.\nPlaintiffs allege that the Visa and MasterCard\nrequirement that if an ATM operator charges an\naccess fee on Visa and MasterCard\ntransactions, then that fee cannot be greater\nthan the access fee charged for transactions\non other networks, violates antitrust rules.\nPlaintiffs seek treble damages, restitution,\ninjunctive relief, and attorneys\u2019 fees where\navailable under federal and state law. Two\nother antitrust cases that make similar\nallegations were filed in the same court, but\nthese cases did not name Wells Fargo as a\ndefendant. On February 13, 2013, the district\ncourt granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss\nthe threeactions. Plaintiffs appealed the\ndismissals and, on August 4, 2015, the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia Circuit vacated the district court\u2019s\ndecisions and remanded the threecases to the\ndistrict court for further proceedings. On\nJune 28, 2016, the United States Supreme Court\ngranted defendants\u2019 petitions for writ of\ncertiorari to review the decisions of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the\nDistrict of Columbia. On November 17, 2016,\nthe United States Supreme Court dismissed the\npetitions as improvidently granted, and the\nthreecases returned to the district court for\nfurther proceedings. The Company has entered\ninto an agreement pursuant to which the\nCompany will pay $ 20.8million to resolve the\ncases, subject to court approval. AUTOMOBILE\nLENDING MATTERS On April 20, 2018, the Company\nentered into consent orders with the Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to\nresolve, among other things, investigations by\nthe agencies into the Company\u2019s compliance\nrisk management program and its past practices\ninvolving certain automobile collateral\nprotection insurance (CPI) policies and\ncertain mortgage interest rate lock\nextensions. The consent orders require\nremediation to customers and the payment of a\ntotal of $ 1.0billion in civil money penalties\nto the agencies. In July 2017, the Company\nannounced a plan to remediate customers who\nmay have been financially harmed due to issues\nrelated to automobile CPI policies purchased\nthrough a third-party vendor on their behalf.\nMultiple putative class actions alleging,\namong other things, unfair and deceptive\npractices relating to these CPI policies, were\nfiled against the Company and consolidated\ninto onemulti-district litigation in the\nUnited States District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California. As previously\ndisclosed, the Company entered into a\nsettlement to resolve the multi-district\nlitigation. Shareholders also filed a putative\nsecurities fraud class action against the\nCompany and its executive officers alleging\nmaterial misstatements and omissions of CPI-\nrelated information in the Company\u2019s public\ndisclosures. In January 2020, the court\ndismissed this action as to all defendants\nexcept the Company and a former executive\nofficer and limited the action to two alleged\nmisstatements. In addition, the Company is\nsubject to a class action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Central District of\nCalifornia alleging that customers are\nentitled to refunds related to the unused\nportion of guaranteed automobile protection\n(GAP) waiver or insurance agreements between\nthe customer and dealer and, by assignment,\nthe lender. In June 2021, the court granted\npreliminary approval of an agreement pursuant\nto which the Company will pay $ 45million and\nmake certain changes to its GAP refund\npractices in order to settle the action.\nAllegations related to the CPI and GAP\nprograms are among the subjects of a\nshareholder derivative lawsuit pending in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California. These and other issues\nrelated to the origination, servicing, and\ncollection of consumer auto loans, including\nrelated insurance products, have also\nsubjected the Company to formal or informal\ninquiries, investigations, or examinations\nfrom federal and state government agencies,\nincluding the CFPB. As previously disclosed,\nthe Company entered into an agreement to\nresolve investigations by the state attorneys\ngeneral. COMMERCIAL LENDING SHAREHOLDER\nLITIGATION In October and November 2020,\nplaintiffs filed two putative securities fraud\nclass actions in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of California\nalleging that the Company and certain of its\nformer executive officers made false and\nmisleading statements or omissions regarding,\namong other things, the Company\u2019s commercial\nlending underwriting practices, the credit\nquality of its commercial credit portfolios,\nand the value of its commercial loans,\ncollateralized loan obligations and commercial\nmortgage-backed securities.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    113  \n                                \n                                              \n  Note 13:Legal Actions(continued)            \n                                              \nCONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION Wells\nFargo shareholders have brought a putative\nsecurities fraud class action in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York alleging that the Company\nand certain of its current and former\nexecutive officers and directors made false or\nmisleading statements regarding the Company\u2019s\nefforts to comply with the February 2018\nconsent order with the Federal Reserve Board\nand the April 2018 consent orders with the\nCFPB and OCC. Allegations related to the\nCompany\u2019s efforts to comply with these three\nconsent orders are also among the subjects of\na shareholder derivative lawsuit pending in\nthe United States District Court for the\nNorthern District of California. CONSUMER\nDEPOSIT ACCOUNT RELATED REGULATORY\nINVESTIGATIONS The CFPB is conducting an\ninvestigation into whether customers were\nunduly harmed by the Company\u2019s historical\npractices associated with the freezing (and,\nin many cases, closing) of consumer deposit\naccounts after the Company detected suspected\nfraudulent activity (by third parties or\naccount holders) that affected those accounts.\nThe CFPB is also investigating certain of the\nCompany's past disclosures to customers\nregarding the minimum qualifying debit card\nusage required for customers to receive a\nwaiver of monthly service fees on certain\nconsumer deposit accounts. FOREIGN EXCHANGE\nBUSINESS The United States Department of\nJustice (Department of Justice) is\ninvestigating certain activities in the\nCompany\u2019s foreign exchange business, including\nwhether customers may have received pricing\ninconsistent with commitments made to those\ncustomers. Previous investigations by other\nfederal government agencies have been\nresolved. INTERCHANGE LITIGATION Plaintiffs\nrepresenting a class of merchants have filed\nputative class actions, and individual\nmerchants have filed individual actions,\nagainst Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo &\nCompany, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and Wachovia\nCorporation regarding the interchange fees\nassociated with Visa and MasterCard payment\ncard transactions. Visa, MasterCard, and\nseveral other banks and bank holding companies\nare also named as defendants in these actions.\nThese actions have been consolidated in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York. The amended and\nconsolidated complaint asserts claims against\ndefendants based on alleged violations of\nfederal and state antitrust laws and seeks\ndamages, as well as injunctive relief.\nPlaintiff merchants allege that Visa,\nMasterCard, and payment card issuing banks\nunlawfully colluded to set interchange rates.\nPlaintiffs also allege that enforcement of\ncertain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged\ntying and bundling of services offered to\nmerchants are anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and\nWachovia, along with other defendants and\nentities, are parties to Loss and Judgment\nSharing Agreements, which provide that they,\nalong with other entities, will share, based\non a formula, in any losses from the\nInterchange Litigation. On July 13, 2012,\nVisa, MasterCard, and the financial\ninstitution defendants, including Wells Fargo,\nsigned a memorandum of understanding with\nplaintiff merchants to resolve the\nconsolidated class action and reached a\nseparate settlement in principle of the\nconsolidated individual actions. The\nsettlement payments to be made by all\ndefendants in the consolidated class and\nindividual actions totaled approximately $\n6.6billion before reductions applicable to\ncertain merchants opting out of the\nsettlement. The class settlement also provided\nfor the distribution to class merchants of 10\nbasis points of default interchange across all\ncredit rate categories for a period of eight\nconsecutive months. The district court granted\nfinal approval of the settlement, which was\nappealed to the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit by settlement objector\nmerchants. Other merchants opted out of the\nsettlement and are pursuing several individual\nactions. On June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit\nvacated the settlement agreement and reversed\nand remanded the consolidated action to the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York for further proceedings.\nOn November 23, 2016, prior class counsel\nfiled a petition to the United States Supreme\nCourt, seeking review of the reversal of the\nsettlement by the Second Circuit, and the\nSupreme Court denied the petition on March 27,\n2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court\nappointed lead class counsel for a damages\nclass and an equitable relief class. The\nparties have entered into a settlement\nagreement to resolve the money damages class\nclaims pursuant to which defendants will pay a\ntotal of approximately $ 6.2billion, which\nincludes approximately $ 5.3billion of funds\nremaining from the 2012 settlement and $\n900million in additional funding. The\nCompany\u2019s allocated responsibility for the\nadditional funding is approximately $\n94.5million. The court granted final approval\nof the settlement on December 13, 2019, which\nwas appealed to the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit by settlement\nobjector merchants. Several of the opt-out and\ndirect action litigations have been settled\nwhile others remain pending. LOW INCOME\nHOUSING TAX CREDITS Federal government\nagencies have undertaken formal or informal\ninquiries or investigations regarding the\nmanner in which the Company purchased, and\nnegotiated the purchase of, certain federal\nlow income housing tax credits in connection\nwith the financing of low income housing\ndevelopments. MORTGAGE LENDING MATTERS\nPlaintiffs representing a class of mortgage\nborrowers have filed separate putative class\nactions, Hernandez v. Wells Fargo, et al. ,\nCoordes v. Wells Fargo, et al. , Ryder v.\nWells Fargo , Liguori v. Wells Fargo , and\nDore v. Wells Fargo , against Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A., in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of California,\nthe United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Washington, the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of\nOhio, the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York, and the United\nStates District Court for the Western District\nof Pennsylvania, respectively. Plaintiffs\nallege that Wells Fargo improperly denied\nmortgage loan modifications or repayment plans\nto customers in the foreclosure process due to\nthe overstatement of foreclosure attorneys\u2019\nfees that were included for purposes of\ndetermining whether a customer in the\nforeclosure process qualified for a mortgage\nloan modification or repayment plan. In March\n2020, the Company entered into an agreement\npursuant to which the Company paid $\n18.5million to resolve the claims of the\ninitial certified class in the Hernandez case,\nwhich was approved by the district court in\nOctober 2020. The Hernandez settlement has\nbeen reopened to include additional borrowers\nwho the Company determined should have been\nincluded in the settlement class because the\nCompany identified a population of additional\nborrowers during the relevant class period\nwhose loans had not previously been reviewed\nfor inclusion in the original population of\nimpacted customers. In June 2021, the Company\nentered into an agreement pursuant to which\nthe Company will pay an additional\napproximately $ 22million to resolve the\nHernandez case. In July 2021, the Company\nentered into an agreement in the Ryder case\npursuant to which the Company will pay $\n12million to cover other impacted borrowers\nwho were not included in the Hernandez case.\nThe Dore and Coordes cases have been\nvoluntarily dismissed. In addition, federal\nbanking regulators and other government\nagencies have undertaken formal or informal\n                                \n  114    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \ninquiries or investigations regarding these\nand other mortgage servicing matters.\nNOMURA/NATIXIS MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION In\nAugust 2014 and August 2015, Nomura Credit &\nCapital Inc. (Nomura) and Natixis Real Estate\nHoldings, LLC (Natixis) filed a total of\nseventhird-party complaints against Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A., in New York state court. In\nthe underlying first-party actions, Nomura and\nNatixis have been sued for alleged breaches of\nrepresentations and warranties made in\nconnection with residential mortgage-backed\nsecurities sponsored by them. In the third-\nparty actions, Nomura and Natixis allege that\nWells Fargo, as master servicer, primary\nservicer or securities administrator, failed\nto notify Nomura and Natixis of their own\nbreaches, failed to properly oversee the\nprimary servicers, and failed to adhere to\naccepted servicing practices. Natixis\nadditionally alleges that Wells Fargo failed\nto perform default oversight duties. Wells\nFargo has asserted counterclaims alleging that\nNomura and Natixis failed to provide Wells\nFargo notice of their representation and\nwarranty breaches. OFAC RELATED INVESTIGATION\nThe Company has self-identified an issue\nwhereby certain foreign banks utilized a Wells\nFargo software-based solution to conduct\nimport/export trade-related financing\ntransactions with countries and entities\nprohibited by the Office of Foreign Assets\nControl (OFAC) of the United States Department\nof the Treasury. We do not believe any funds\nrelated to these transactions flowed through\naccounts at Wells Fargo as a result of the\naforementioned conduct. The Company has made\nvoluntary self-disclosures to OFAC and is\ncooperating with an inquiry from the\nDepartment of Justice. ORDER OF POSTING\nLITIGATION Plaintiffs filed a series of\nputative class actions against Wachovia Bank,\nN.A., and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as well as\nmany other banks, challenging the \u201chigh to\nlow\u201d order in which the banks post debit card\ntransactions to consumer deposit accounts.\nMost of these actions were consolidated in\nmulti-district litigation proceedings (MDL\nproceedings) in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of Florida.\nThe court in the MDL proceedings has certified\na class of putative plaintiffs, and Wells\nFargo moved to compel arbitration of the\nclaims of unnamed class members. The court\ndenied the motions to compel arbitration in\nOctober 2016, and Wells Fargo appealed this\ndecision to the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Eleventh Circuit. In May 2018, the\nEleventh Circuit ruled in Wells Fargo\u2019s favor\nand found that Wells Fargo had not waived its\narbitration rights and remanded the case to\nthe district court for further proceedings. On\nSeptember 26, 2019, the district court entered\nan order granting Wells Fargo\u2019s motion and\ndismissed the claims of unnamed class members\nin favor of arbitration, which was appealed by\nplaintiffs to the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In April\n2021, the Eleventh Circuit upheld the district\ncourt's decision. RETAIL SALES PRACTICES\nMATTERS A number of bodies or entities,\nincluding (a) federal, state, and local\ngovernment agencies, including the Department\nof Justice, the United States Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC), and the United\nStates Department of Labor, (b) state\nattorneys general, including the New York\nAttorney General, and (c) Congressional\ncommittees, have undertaken formal or informal\ninquiries, investigations, or examinations\narising out of certain retail sales practices\nof the Company that were the subject of\nsettlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the\nOffice of the Los Angeles City Attorney\nannounced by the Company on September 8, 2016.\nThe Company has responded to requests from\ncertain of the foregoing. As previously\ndisclosed, the Company entered into agreements\nto resolve the state attorneys general\ninvestigations. On February 21, 2020, the\nCompany entered into an agreement with the\nDepartment of Justice to resolve the\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s criminal investigation\ninto the Company\u2019s retail sales practices, as\nwell as a separate agreement to resolve the\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s civil investigation.\nAs part of the Department of Justice criminal\nsettlement, no charges will be filed against\nthe Company provided the Company abides by all\nthe terms of the agreement. The Department of\nJustice criminal settlement also includes the\nCompany\u2019s agreement that the facts set forth\nin the settlement document constitute\nsufficient facts for the finding of criminal\nviolations of statutes regarding bank records\nand personal information.On February 21, 2020,\nthe Company also entered into an order to\nresolve the SEC\u2019s investigation arising out of\nthe Company\u2019s retail sales practices. The SEC\norder contains a finding, to which the Company\nconsented, that the facts set forth include\nviolations of Section 10(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\nthereunder.As part of the resolution of the\nDepartment of Justice and SEC investigations,\nthe Company made payments totaling $\n3.0billion. In addition, as part of the\nsettlements and included in the $ 3.0billion\namount, the Company agreed to the creation of\na $ 500million Fair Fund for the benefit of\ninvestors who were harmed by the conduct\ncovered in the SEC settlement. In addition, a\nnumber of lawsuits were filed by non-\ngovernmental parties seeking damages or other\nremedies related to these retail sales\npractices. As previously disclosed, the\nCompany entered into various settlements to\nresolve these lawsuits. RMBS TRUSTEE\nLITIGATION In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF\nLimited and certain related entities and the\nNational Credit Union Administration (NCUA)\nfiled complaints in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York\nagainst Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., alleging\nclaims against the Company in its capacity as\ntrustee for a number of residential mortgage-\nbacked securities trusts. Complaints raising\nsimilar allegations have been filed by\nCommerzbank AG in the Southern District of New\nYork and by IKB International and IKB Deutsche\nIndustriebank in New York state court. In each\ncase, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to\ninvestors, and plaintiffs assert causes of\naction based upon, among other things, the\ntrustee\u2019s alleged failure to notify and\nenforce repurchase obligations of mortgage\nloan sellers for purported breaches of\nrepresentations and warranties, notify\ninvestors of alleged events of default, and\nabide by appropriate standards of care\nfollowing alleged events of default. The\nCompany previously settled twoclass actions\nwith similar allegations that were filed in\nNovember 2014 and December 2016 by\ninstitutional investors in the Southern\nDistrict of New York and New York state court,\nrespectively. In March 2021, the Company\nentered into an agreement to resolve the case\nfiled by the NCUA. SEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE\nLITIGATION The Seminole Tribe of Florida filed\na complaint in Florida state court alleging\nthat Wells Fargo, as trustee, charged excess\nfees in connection with the administration of\na minor\u2019s trust and failed to invest the\nassets of the trust prudently. The complaint\nwas later amended to include threeindividual\ncurrent and former beneficiaries as plaintiffs\nand to remove the Tribe as a party to the\ncase. In December 2016, the Company filed a\nmotion to dismiss the amended complaint on the\ngrounds that the Tribe is a necessary party\nand that the individual beneficiaries lack\nstanding to bring\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    115  \n                                \n                                              \n  Note 13:Legal Actions(continued)            \n                                              \nclaims. The motion was\ndenied in June 2018.\nThe case is pending\ntrial. OUTLOOK As\ndescribed above, the\nCompany establishes\naccruals for legal\nactions when potential\nlosses associated with\nthe actions become\nprobable and the costs\ncan be reasonably\nestimated. The high\nend of the range of\nreasonably possible\npotential losses in\nexcess of the\nCompany\u2019s accrual for\nprobable and estimable\nlosses was\napproximately $\n2.8billion as of June\n30, 2021. The outcomes\nof legal actions are\nunpredictable and\nsubject to significant\nuncertainties, and it\nis inherently\ndifficult to determine\nwhether any loss is\nprobable or even\npossible. It is also\ninherently difficult\nto estimate the amount\nof any loss and there\nmay be matters for\nwhich a loss is\nprobable or reasonably\npossible but not\ncurrently estimable.\nAccordingly, actual\nlosses may be in\nexcess of the\nestablished accrual or\nthe range of\nreasonably possible\nloss. Based on\ninformation currently\navailable, advice of\ncounsel, available\ninsurance coverage,\nand established\nreserves, Wells Fargo\nbelieves that the\neventual outcome of\nthe actions against\nWells Fargo and/or its\nsubsidiaries will not,\nindividually or in the\naggregate, have a\nmaterial adverse\neffect on Wells\nFargo\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial condition.\nHowever, it is\npossible that the\nultimate resolution of\na matter, if\nunfavorable, may be\nmaterial to Wells\nFargo\u2019s results of\noperations for any\nparticular period.\n                                \n  116    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \n                       \n  Note 14:Derivatives  \n                       \nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to\nmarket risk, including interest rate risk,\ncredit risk and foreign currency risk, and to\nassist customers with their risk management\nobjectives. We designate certain derivatives\nas hedging instruments in qualifying hedge\naccounting relationships (fair value or cash\nflow hedges). Our remaining derivatives\nconsist of economic hedges that do not qualify\nfor hedge accounting and derivatives held for\ncustomer accommodation trading or other\npurposes. For additional information on our\nderivative activities, see Note 16\n(Derivatives) in our 2020 Form 10-K. Table\n14.1 presents the total notional or\ncontractual amounts and fair values for our\nderivatives. Derivative transactions can be\nmeasured in terms of the notional amount, but\nthis amount is not recorded on our\nconsolidated balance sheet and is not, when\nviewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of\nthe risk profile of the instruments. The\nnotional amount is generally not exchanged,\nbut is used only as the basis on which\ninterest and other payments are determined.\nTable 14.1: Notional or Contractual Amounts\nand Fair Values of Derivatives\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2014    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \nTable 14.2 provides information on the gross\nfair values of derivative assets and\nliabilities, the balance sheet netting\nadjustments and the resulting net fair value\namount recorded on our consolidated balance\nsheet, as well as the non-cash collateral\nassociated with such arrangements. We execute\nsubstantially all of our derivative\ntransactions under master netting arrangements\nand reflect all derivative balances and\nrelated cash collateral subject to enforceable\nmaster netting arrangements on a net basis\nwithin the consolidated balance sheet. The\n\u201cGross amounts recognized\u201d column in the\nfollowing table includes $ 52.9billion and $\n44.7billion of gross derivative assets and\nliabilities, respectively, at June 30, 2021,\nand $ 54.6billion and $ 50.1billion,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2020, with\ncounterparties subject to enforceable master\nnetting arrangements that are eligible for\nbalance sheet netting adjustments. The\nmajority of these amounts are interest rate\ncontracts executed in over-the-counter (OTC)\nmarkets. The remaining gross derivative assets\nand liabilities of $ 8.1billion and $\n5.0billion, respectively, at June 30, 2021,\nand $ 11.1billion and $ 8.0billion,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2020, include\nthose with counterparties subject to master\nnetting arrangements for which we have not\nassessed the enforceability because they are\nwith counterparties where we do not currently\nhave positions to offset, those subject to\nmaster netting arrangements where we have not\nbeen able to confirm the enforceability and\nthose not subject to master netting\narrangements. As such, we do not net\nderivative balances or collateral within the\nconsolidated balance sheet for these\ncounterparties. Cash collateral receivables\nand payables that have not been offset against\nour derivatives were $ 2.6billion and $\n828million, respectively, at June 30, 2021,\nand $ 1.8billion and $ 984million,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2020.

The \u201cNet amounts\u201d\ncolumn within Table 14.2 represents the\naggregate of our net exposure to each\ncounterparty after considering the balance\nsheet and Disclosure-only netting adjustments.\nWe manage derivative exposure by monitoring\nthe credit risk associated with each\ncounterparty using counterparty-specific\ncredit risk limits, using master netting\narrangements and obtaining collateral.\nDerivative contracts executed in OTC markets\ninclude bilateral contractual arrangements\nthat are not cleared through a central\nclearing organization but are typically\nsubject to master netting arrangements. The\nproportion of these derivative contracts\nrelative to our total derivative assets and\nliabilities are presented in the \u201cPercent\nexchanged in over-the-counter market\u201d column\nin Table 14.2. In addition to the netting\namounts included in the table, we also have\nbalance sheet netting related to resale and\nrepurchase agreements that are disclosed\nwithin Note 12 (Pledged Assets and\nCollateral).\n\nTable 14.2: Gross Fair Values of Derivative\nAssets and Liabilities\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n                                              \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n                                              \n(1) Represents amounts with counterparties\nsubject to enforceable master netting\narrangements that have been offset in the\nconsolidated balance sheet, including related\ncash collateral and portfolio level\ncounterparty valuation adjustments.\nCounterparty valuation adjustments related to\nderivative assets were $ 299million and $\n399million and debit valuation adjustments\nrelated to derivative liabilities were $\n145million and $ 201million as of June 30,\n2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nCash collateral totaled $ 5.4billion and $\n5.1billion, netted against derivative assets\nand liabilities, respectively, at June 30,\n2021, and $ 5.5billion and $ 7.5billion,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2020.\n                                \n  118    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nFair Value and Cash Flow Hedges For fair value\nhedges, we use interest rate swaps to convert\ncertain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and\ntime certificates of deposit to floating rates\nto hedge our exposure to interest rate risk.\nWe also enter into cross-currency swaps,\ncross-currency interest rate swaps and forward\ncontracts to hedge our exposure to foreign\ncurrency risk and interest rate risk\nassociated with the issuance of non-U.S.\ndollar denominated long-term debt. In\naddition, we use interest rate swaps, cross-\ncurrency swaps, cross-currency interest rate\nswaps and forward contracts to hedge against\nchanges in fair value of certain investments\nin available-for-sale debt securities due to\nchanges in interest rates, foreign currency\nrates, or both. For certain fair value hedges\nof foreign currency risk, changes in fair\nvalue of cross-currency swaps attributable to\nchanges in cross-currency basis spreads are\nexcluded from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and recorded in other\ncomprehensive income. See Note 21 (Other\nComprehensive Income) for the amounts\nrecognized in other comprehensive income. For\ncash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps\nto hedge the variability in interest payments\nreceived on certain floating- rate commercial\nloans and paid on certain floating-rate debt\ndue to changes in the contractually specified\ninterest rate. We also use cross-currency\nswaps to hedge variability in interest\npayments on fixed-rate foreign currency-\ndenominated long-term debt due to changes in\nforeign exchange rates. We estimate $\n76million pre-tax of deferred net losses\nrelated to cash flow hedges in OCI at June 30,\n2021, will be reclassified into net interest\nincome during the next twelve months. The\ndeferred losses expected to be reclassified\ninto net interest income are predominantly\nrelated to discontinued hedges of floating\nrate loans. For cash flow hedges as of June\n30, 2021, we are hedging our foreign currency\nexposure to the variability of future cash\nflows for all forecasted transactions for a\nmaximum of 9years. For additional information\non our accounting hedges, see Note 1 (Summary\nof Significant Accounting Policies).

We use credit\nderivatives to assist customers with their\nrisk management objectives. We may also use\ncredit derivatives in structured product\ntransactions or liquidity agreements written\nto special purpose vehicles. The maximum\nexposure of sold credit derivatives is managed\nthrough posted collateral, purchased credit\nderivatives and similar products in order to\nachieve our desired credit risk profile. This\ncredit risk management provides an ability to\nrecover a significant portion of any amounts\nthat would be paid under sold credit\nderivatives. We would be required to perform\nunder the sold credit derivatives in the event\nof default by the referenced obligors. Events\nof default include events such as bankruptcy,\ncapital restructuring or lack of principal\nand/or interest payment. In certain cases,\nother triggers may exist, such as the credit\ndowngrade of the referenced obligors or the\ninability of the special purpose vehicle for\nwhich we have provided liquidity to obtain\nfunding.

We\nconsider the risk of\nperformance to be high\nif the underlying\nassets under the\ncredit derivative have\nan external rating\nthat is below\ninvestment grade or an\ninternal credit\ndefault grade that is\nequivalent thereto. We\nbelieve the net\nprotection sold, which\nis representative of\nthe net notional\namount of protection\nsold and purchased\nwith identical\nunderlyings, in\ncombination with other\nprotection purchased,\nis more representative\nof our exposure to\nloss than either non-\ninvestment grade or\nprotection sold. Other\nprotection purchased\nrepresents additional\nprotection, which may\noffset the exposure to\nloss for protection\nsold, that was not\npurchased with an\nidentical underlying\nof the protection\nsold.\n\nCredit-Risk Contingent\nFeatures Certain of\nour derivative\ncontracts contain\nprovisions whereby if\nthe credit rating of\nour debt were to be\ndowngraded by certain\nmajor credit rating\nagencies, the\ncounterparty could\ndemand additional\ncollateral or require\ntermination or\nreplacement of\nderivative instruments\nin a net liability\nposition.

Assets and liabilities recorded\nat fair value on a recurring basis, such as\nderivatives, residential MSRs, and trading or\nAFS debt securities, are presented in Table\n15.1 in this Note. Additionally, from time to\ntime, we record fair value adjustments on a\nnonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring\nadjustments typically involve application of\nlower of cost or fair value (LOCOM)\naccounting, write-downs of individual assets\nor application of the measurement alternative\nfor nonmarketable equity securities. Assets\nrecorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nare presented in Table 15.4 in this Note. We\nprovide in Table 15.8 estimates of fair value\nfor financial instruments that are not\nrecorded at fair value, such as loans and debt\nliabilities carried at amortized cost. See\nNote 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies) in our 2020 Form 10-K for discussion\nof how we determine fair value. For\ndescriptions of the valuation methodologies we\nuse for assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value on a recurring or nonrecurring\nbasis, see Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and\nLiabilities) in our 2020 Form 10-K. FAIR VALUE\nHIERARCHY We classify our assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair value as either\nLevel 1, 2, or 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to\nvaluations based on unadjusted quoted prices\nin active markets and the lowest priority\n(Level 3) is assigned to valuations based on\nsignificant unobservable inputs. See Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies)\nin our 2020 Form 10-K for a detailed\ndescription of the fair value hierarchy. In\nthe determination of the classification of\nfinancial instruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy, we consider all\navailable information, including observable\nmarket data, indications of market liquidity\nand orderliness, and our understanding of the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs\nused.

We may elect the\nfair value option to align the measurement\nmodel with how the financial assets or\nliabilities are managed or to reduce\ncomplexity or accounting asymmetry. Following\nis a discussion of the portfolios for which we\nelected the fair value option. For additional\ninformation, including the basis for our fair\nvalue option elections, see Note 17 (Fair\nValues of Assets and Liabilities) in our 2020\nForm 10-K. Table 15.7 reflects differences\nbetween the fair value carrying amount of the\nassets for which we have elected the fair\nvalue option and the contractual aggregate\nunpaid principal amount at maturity.\nNonaccrual loans and loans 90 days or more\npast due and still accruing included in LHFS\nfor which we have elected the fair value\noption were insignificant at June 30, 2021,\nand December 31, 2020.\n\nTable 15.7: Fair Value Option\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    131  \n                                \nNote 15: Fair Values\nof Assets and\nLiabilities\n(continued)\n\nThe changes in fair\nvalue related to\ninitial measurement\nand subsequent changes\nin fair value included\nin earnings for LHFS\naccounted for under\nthe fair value option\nwere $ 823million and\n$ 1.2billion in the\nsecond quarter and\nfirst half of 2021,\nrespectively, and $\n773million and $\n1.1billion in the\nsecond quarter and\nfirst half of 2020,\nrespectively.\nSubstantially all of\nthese amounts were\nincluded in the\nmortgage banking\nnoninterest income\nline of the\nconsolidated statement\nof income. For\nperforming loans,\ninstrument-specific\ncredit risk gains or\nlosses were derived\nprincipally by\ndetermining the change\nin fair value of the\nloans due to changes\nin the observable or\nimplied credit spread.\nCredit spread is the\nmarket yield on the\nloans less the\nrelevant risk-free\nbenchmark interest\nrate. For\nnonperforming loans,\nwe attribute all\nchanges in fair value\nto instrument-specific\ncredit risk. Gains and\nlosses attributable to\ninstrument-specific\ncredit risk related to\nassets accounted for\nunder the fair value\noption in the second\nquarter and first half\nof both 2021 and 2020\nwere insignificant.\n\nDisclosures about Fair\nValue of Financial\nInstruments Table 15.8\npresents a summary of\nfair value estimates\nfor financial\ninstruments that are\nnot carried at fair\nvalue on a recurring\nbasis. Some financial\ninstruments are\nexcluded from the\nscope of this table,\nsuch as certain\ninsurance contracts,\ncertain nonmarketable\nequity securities, and\nleases.

The Cash Balance Plan was frozen on\nJuly 1, 2009, and nonew benefits accrue after\nthat date. For additional information on our\npension and postretirement plans, including\nplan assumptions, investment strategy and\nasset allocation, projected benefit payments,\nand valuation methodologies used for assets\nmeasured at fair value, see Note 21 (Employee\nBenefits and Other Expenses) in our 2020 Form\n10-K. We recognize settlement losses for our\nCash Balance Plan based on an assessment of\nwhether lump sum benefit payments will, in\naggregate for the year, exceed the sum of its\nannual service and interest cost (threshold).\nSettlement losses of $ 62million and $\n70million were recognized during second\nquarter 2021 and 2020, respectively,\nrepresenting the pro rata portion of the net\nloss in cumulative other comprehensive income\nbased on the percentage reduction in the Cash\nBalance Plan\u2019s projected benefit obligation\nattributable to lump sum benefit payments\nduring the first half of both 2021 and 2020.\nAs a result of the settlement losses, we re-\nmeasured the Cash Balance Plan obligation and\nplan assets as of both June 30, 2021 and 2020,\nand used a discount rate of 2.80% and 2.75%,\nrespectively, based on our consistent\nmethodology of determining our discount rate\nusing a yield curve with maturity dates that\nclosely match the estimated timing of the\nexpected benefit payments. The result of the\nsettlement losses and remeasurement increased\nthe Cash Balance Plan asset by $ 347million\nand other comprehensive income (pre-tax) by $\n409million in second quarter 2021, and\nincreased the Cash Balance Plan liability by $\n674million and decreased other comprehensive\nincome (pre-tax) by $ 604million in second\nquarter 2020.

management reporting is organized into\nfourreportable operating segments: Consumer\nBanking and Lending; Commercial Banking;\nCorporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth\nand Investment Management. All other business\nactivities that are not included in the\nreportable operating segments have been\nincluded in Corporate. We define our\nreportable operating segments by type of\nproduct and customer segment, and their\nresults are based on our management reporting\nprocess. The management reporting process\nmeasures the performance of the reportable\noperating segments based on the Company\u2019s\nmanagement structure, and the results are\nregularly reviewed by our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Operating Committee. The\nmanagement reporting process is based on U.S.\nGAAP and includes specific adjustments, such\nas funds transfer pricing for asset/liability\nmanagement, shared revenues and expenses, and\ntaxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently\nreflect income from taxable and tax-exempt\nsources, which allows management to assess\nperformance consistently across the operating\nsegments. In March 2021, we announced an\nagreement to sell our Corporate Trust Services\nbusiness and, in second quarter 2021, we moved\nthe business from the Commercial Banking\noperating segment to Corporate. Prior period\nbalances have been revised to conform with the\ncurrent period presentation. This change did\nnot impact the previously reported\nconsolidated financial results of the Company.\nIn second quarter 2021, we elected to change\nour accounting method for low-income housing\ntax credit (LIHTC) investments and elected to\nchange the presentation of investment tax\ncredits related to solar energy investments.\nThese accounting policy changes had a nominal\nimpact on reportable operating segment\nresults. Prior period financial statement line\nitems for the Company, as well as for the\nreportable operating segments, have been\nrevised to conform with the current period\npresentation. Our LIHTC investments are\nincluded in the Corporate and Investment\nBanking operating segment and our solar energy\ninvestments are included in the Commercial\nBanking operating segment. For additional\ninformation, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies). Consumer\nBanking and Lending offers diversified\nfinancial products and services for consumers\nand small businesses with annual sales\ngenerally up to $ 5million.

In addition,\nCorporate includes all restructuring charges\nrelated to our efficiency initiatives. See\nNote 19 (Restructuring Charges) for additional\ninformation on restructuring charges.\nCorporate also includes certain lines of\nbusiness that management has determined are no\nlonger consistent with the long-term strategic\ngoals of the Company, as well as results for\npreviously divested businesses. Basis of\nPresentation FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING Corporate\ntreasury manages a funds transfer pricing\nmethodology that considers interest rate risk,\nliquidity risk, and other product\ncharacteristics. Operating segments pay a\nfunding charge for their assets and receive a\nfunding credit for their deposits, both of\nwhich are included in net interest income. The\nnet impact of the funding charges or credits\nis recognized in corporate treasury. REVENUE\nAND EXPENSE SHARING When lines of business\njointly serve customers, the line of business\nthat is responsible for providing the product\nor service recognizes revenue or expense with\na referral fee paid or an allocation of cost\nto the other line of business based on\nestablished internal revenue-sharing\nagreements. When a line of business uses a\nservice provided by another line of business\nor enterprise function (included in\nCorporate), expense is generally allocated\nbased on the cost and use of the service\nprovided. TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS\nTaxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-\nexempt income on certain loans and debt\nsecurities are included in net interest\nincome, while taxable-equivalent adjustments\nrelated to income tax credits for low-income\nhousing and renewable energy investments are\nincluded in noninterest income, in each case\nwith corresponding impacts to income tax\nexpense (benefit).

The\nFRB establishes capital requirements for the\nconsolidated financial holding company, and\nthe OCC has similar requirements for the\nCompany\u2019s national banks, including Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A. (the Bank). Table 23.1\npresents regulatory capital information for\nWells Fargo & Company and the Bank in\naccordance with Basel III capital\nrequirements. Our capital adequacy is assessed\nbased on the lower of our risk-based capital\nratios calculated under the Standardized\nApproach and under the Advanced Approach. The\nStandardized Approach applies assigned risk\nweights to broad risk categories, while the\ncalculation of risk-weighted assets (RWAs)\nunder the Advanced Approach differs by\nrequiring applicable banks to utilize a risk-\nsensitive methodology, which relies upon the\nuse of internal credit models, and includes an\noperational risk component. The Basel III\ncapital requirements for calculating Common\nEquity Tier 1 (CET1) and tier 1 capital, along\nwith RWAs, are fully phased-in. However, the\nrequirements for determining tier 2 and total\ncapital are still in accordance with\ntransition requirements and are scheduled to\nbe fully phased-in by the end of 2021.\nAccordingly, the information presented below\nreflects fully phased-in CET1 capital, tier 1\ncapital, and RWAs, but reflects total capital\nstill in accordance with transition\nrequirements. At June 30, 2021, the Bank and\nour other insured depository institutions were\nconsidered well-capitalized under the\nrequirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nAct.\nTable 23.1: Regulatory Capital Information (1)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n*Denotes the binding ratio based on the lower\ncalculation under the Advanced and\nStandardized Approaches.\n(1) At June 30, 2021, the impact of the CECL\ntransition provision issued by federal banking\nregulators on the regulatory capital of the\nCompany was an increase in capital of $\n879million, reflecting a $ 991million (post-\ntax) increase in capital recognized upon our\ninitial adoption of CECL, offset by 25% of the\n$ 7.5billion increase in our ACL under CECL\nfrom January 1, 2020, through June 30, 2021.\nThe impact of the CECL transition provision on\nthe regulatory capital of the Bank at June 30,\n2021, was an increase in capital of $\n879million.\n(2) RWAs for the Company and the Bank included\nan increase of $ 547million under the\nStandardized Approach and a decrease of $\n1.4billion under the Advanced Approach related\nto the impact of the CECL transition provision\non the excess allowance for credit losses as\nof June 30, 2021.\n(3) The SLR consists of tier 1 capital divided\nby total leverage exposure. Total leverage\nexposure consists of total average assets,\nless goodwill and other permitted tier 1\ncapital deductions (net of deferred tax\nliabilities), plus certain off-balance sheet\nexposures.\n(4) In 2020, the FRB issued an interim final\nrule that temporarily allowed the exclusion\nfor on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and deposits at Federal Reserve\nBanks from the calculation of total leverage\nexposure in the denominator of the SLR. The\nCompany adopted this interim final rule, but\nthe Bank did not elect to apply these\nexclusions. The interim final rule expired on\nApril 1, 2021.\n(5) The tier 1 leverage ratio consists of tier\n1 capital divided by total average assets,\nexcluding goodwill and certain other items as\ndetermined under the rule.\nAt June 30, 2021, under transition\nrequirements, the CET1, tier 1 and total\ncapital ratio requirements for the Company\nincluded a global systemically important bank\n(G-SIB) surcharge of 2.00%. The G-SIB\nsurcharge is not applicable to the Bank. In\naddition, the CET1, tier 1 and total capital\nratio requirements for the Company and the\nBank included a stress capital buffer of 2.50%\nunder the Standardized Approach and a capital\nconservation buffer of 2.50% under the\nAdvanced Approach. The Company is required to\nmaintain these risk-based capital ratios and\nto maintain an SLR of at least 5.00%\n(comprised of a 3.00% minimum requirement plus\na supplementary leverage buffer of 2.00%) to\navoid restrictions on capital distributions\nand discretionary bonus payments. The Bank is\nrequired to maintain an SLR of at least 6.00%\nto be considered well-capitalized under\napplicable regulatory capital adequacy rules.\nTable 23.2 presents the risk-based capital and\nleverage requirements under transition\nrequirements to which the Company and the Bank\nwere subject as of\nJune 30, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020,\nwhich were the same\nunder both the\nStandardized and\nAdvanced Approaches.\nTable 23.2: Risk-Based\nCapital and Leverage\nRatios \u2013 Transition\nRequirements\n                                              \n                                     Wells    \n                   Wells             Fargo    \n                   Fargo &           Bank,    \n                   Company           N.A.     \n                   Jun 30,           Jun 30,  \n                   2021              2021     \n                   and Dec           and Dec  \n                   31,               31,      \n                   2020              2020     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Common                                      \n  Equity     9.00  %           7.00           \n  Tier 1                                      \n  capit\u2026                                      \n  Tier 1    10.50              8.50           \n  capit\u2026                                      \n  Total     12.50             10.50           \n  capit\u2026                                      \n  Tier 1     4.00              4.00           \n  lever\u2026                                      \n  Suppl\u2026     5.00              6.00           \n  lever\u2026                                      \n                                              \n                                \n  146    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nCapital Planning\nRequirements The FRB\u2019s\nc apital plan rule\nestablishes capital\nplanning and other\nrequirements that\ngovern capital\ndistributions,\nincluding dividends\nand share repurchases,\nby certain large bank\nholding companies\n(BHCs), including\nWells Fargo. The FRB\nconducts an annual\nComprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review\nexercise and has also\npublished guidance\nregarding its\nsupervisory\nexpectations for\ncapital planning,\nincluding capital\npolicies regarding the\nprocess relating to\ncommon stock dividend\nand repurchase\ndecisions in the FRB\u2019s\nSR Letter 15-18. The\nParent\u2019s ability to\nmake certain capital\ndistributions is\nsubject to the\nrequirements of the\ncapital plan rule and\nis also subject to the\nParent meeting or\nexceeding certain\nregulatory capital\nminimums. On March 25,\n2021, the FRB\nannounced that it was\nextending measures it\npreviously announced\nlimiting large BHCs,\nincluding Wells Fargo,\nfrom making any\ncapital distribution\n(excluding any capital\ndistribution arising\nfrom the issuance of a\ncapital instrument\neligible for inclusion\nin the numerator of a\nregulatory capital\nratio), unless\notherwise approved by\nthe FRB. The FRB\ngenerally authorized\nBHCs to (i) provided\nthat the BHC does not\nincrease the amount of\nits common stock\ndividends to be larger\nthan the level paid in\nsecond quarter 2020,\npay common stock\ndividends and make\nshare repurchases\nthat, in the\naggregate, do not\nexceed an amount equal\nto the average of the\nBHC\u2019s net income for\nthe four preceding\ncalendar quarters;\n(ii) make share\nrepurchases that equal\nthe amount of share\nissuances related to\nexpensed employee\ncompensation; and\n(iii) redeem and make\nscheduled payments on\nadditional tier 1 and\ntier 2 capital\ninstruments. These\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions ended on\nJune 30, 2021.\n\nLoan and Dividend\nRestrictions\n\nFederal law restricts\nthe amount and the\nterms of both credit\nand non-credit\ntransactions between a\nbank and its nonbank\naffiliates.\nAdditionally, federal\nlaws and regulations\nlimit the dividends\nthat a national bank\nmay pay.\n\nOur nonbank\nsubsidiaries are also\nlimited by certain\nfederal and state\nstatutory provisions\nand regulations\ncovering the amount of\ndividends that may be\npaid in any given\nyear.
