DESCRIPTION OF\nBUSINESS General We are\na leading financial\nservices company that\nprovides a diversified\nset of banking,\ninvestment and mortgage\nproducts and services,\nas well as consumer and\ncommercial finance,\nthrough banking\nlocations and offices,\nthe internet\n(www.wellsfargo.com) and\nother distribution\nchannels to individuals,\nbusinesses and\ninstitutions in all 50\nstates, the District of\nColumbia and in\ncountries outside the\nU.S. We provide consumer\nfinancial products and\nservices including\nchecking and savings\naccounts, credit and\ndebit cards, and auto,\nmortgage and home\nequity, and small\nbusiness lending. In\naddition, we offer\nfinancial planning,\nprivate banking,\ninvestment management,\nand fiduciary services.\nWe also provide\nfinancial solutions to\nbusinesses through\nproducts and services\nincluding traditional\ncommercial loans and\nlines of credit, letters\nof credit, asset-based\nlending, trade\nfinancing, treasury\nmanagement, and\ninvestment banking\nservices. As of December\n31, 2022, we had four\nreportable operating\nsegments for management\nreporting purposes:\nConsumer Banking and\nLending; Commercial\nBanking; Corporate and\nInvestment Banking; and\nWealth and Investment\nManagement. The 2022\nAnnual Report to\nShareholders includes\nfinancial information\nand descriptions of\nthese operating\nsegments. Human Capital\nOur people are what set\nWells Fargo apart and\nare critical to our\nsuccess. Wells Fargo\ncontinues to invest in\nour employees by\noffering market\ncompetitive\ncompensation, career-\ndevelopment\nopportunities, a broad\narray of benefits, and\nstrong work-life\nprograms.\n                                                   \n  1We do not control this website.

These expectations guide how we lead\nourselves, collaborate with our colleagues, and\nmake decisions. The following expectations apply to\neveryone at Wells Fargo, at every level, and in\nevery role: \u2022 Embrace candor \u2022 Do what\u2019s right \u2022 Be\ngreat at execution \u2022 Learn and grow \u2022 Champion\ndiversity and inclusion \u2022 Build high-performing\nteams (for managers) At December 31, 2022, we had\napproximately 238,000 active employees, with\napproximately 81% of employees based in the United\nStates. Compensation and benefits. Wells Fargo's\ncompensation program is linked to performance\nmanagement and is designed to promote prudent risk\nmanagement and reinforce its culture and operating\nstandards. The compensation principles include: \u2022\nPay for performance : Compensation is linked to\ncompany, line of business, and individual\nperformance, including meeting regulatory\nexpectations and creating long-term value\nconsistent with the interests of shareholders. \u2022\nPromote effective risk management : Compensation\npromotes effective risk management and discourages\nimprudent or excessive risk-taking. \u2022 Attract and\nretain talent : People are one of Wells Fargo's\ncompetitive advantages; therefore, compensation\nhelps attract, motivate, and retain people with the\nskills, talent, and experience to drive superior\nlong-term company performance. In addition, we\nprovide all eligible full- and part-time employees\n(and their eligible dependents, as applicable) with\na comprehensive set of benefits designed to protect\ntheir physical and financial health and to help\nthem make the most of their financial future. Pay\nEquity Review. Wells Fargo is committed to fair and\nequitable compensation practices and, since 2015,\nhas conducted an annual pay equity review through\nengagement with a third-party expert. The review\nanalyzes employee compensation by taking into\naccount gender, race, and ethnicity and factors\nsuch as role, tenure, and geography. The review\nprocess can include compensation adjustments in the\nevent we identify gaps. The 2022 review, modified\nfor adjustments as described, showed that women at\nWells Fargo earn more than 99 cents for every $1\nearned by their male peers, and U.S. employees that\nare racially/ethnically diverse earn more than 99\ncents for every $1 earned by their Caucasian/white\npeers. Promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.\nMeeting the increasingly diverse needs of Wells\nFargo\u2019s global customer base is critical to our\nCompany\u2019s long-term growth and success. Wells Fargo\nvalues and promotes diversity, equity and inclusion\n(DE&I) in every aspect of our business. We are\ndedicated to recruitment and career development\npractices that support our employees and promote\ndiversity in our workforce at all levels of our\nCompany, including leadership positions. We have a\nstrong record of recruiting, promoting, and\nrewarding women and racially/ethnically diverse\nemployees at all levels of our Company, including a\ngoal to increase diverse representation in\nleadership roles. Our Head of Diverse Segments,\nRepresentation and\n                         1                         \nInclusion reports\ndirectly to our CEO and\nleads our DE&I efforts,\nwith responsibility for\ndriving a Company-wide\nDE&I strategy.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022,\nour global workforce was\n52% female and 48% male,\nand our U.S. workforce\nwas 55% female and 45%\nmale. Our U.S. workforce\nwas 54% Caucasian/white\nand 46%\nracially/ethnically\ndiverse.\n\nEmployee training and\ndevelopment. We invest\nheavily in coaching and\ntraining for employees\nand managers. We believe\nthat when our employees\nfeel properly supported,\nengaged, and confident\nin their skills, they\nare more effective and\ncan provide an even\nbetter customer\nexperience. During 2022,\nwe invested\napproximately $200\nmillion in a variety of\nemployee learning and\ndevelopment programs,\nincluding functional\ntraining, regulatory\ncompliance, leadership\nand professional\ndevelopment, early\ntalent development\nprograms, and tuition\nreimbursement.\n\nWork-life programs and\nthe COVID-19 Pandemic.\nWells Fargo offers many\nbenefits, programs, and\nwork arrangements\nintended to provide\nemployees with\nflexibility and work-\nlife balance. In March\n2022, Wells Fargo began\nits Return to Office\nprogram for employees\nwho had been working\nfrom home during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Wells\nFargo believes the\nCompany benefits from\nemployees seeing each\nother on a regular\nbasis. When together, it\nis easier to build\nrelationships, get in-\nthe-moment coaching,\nidentify career\nopportunities, and\nbrainstorm ideas.\nUltimately, when\nemployees work together\nwe believe they learn\nmore about the customers\nand communities the\nCompany serves and how\nto serve them better.\nWith this in mind, Wells\nFargo's approach\nemphasizes spending time\ntogether in the office,\nand also provides\nflexible work options\nfor employees in certain\njobs. For example,\nemployees in certain\nnon-customer-facing\nroles have flexibility\nto have up to two days a\nweek of remote work, and\nspend a minimum of three\ndays a week in the\noffice. Expectations for\nother roles, including\ncustomer-facing,\noperations, technology,\nand non-U.S. based\nemployees, vary by\nbusiness need.\n\nThe health and safety of\nemployees also remains a\npriority. All employees\nglobally may take up to\nfour hours of paid time\naway for each COVID-19\nvaccine appointment\n(including boosters).\nU.S. employees are\nadditionally eligible to\nreceive free COVID-19\ntest kits from Wells\nFargo or through their\nmedical plan, at no\nadditional cost.\n                                                   \n  Competition                                      \n                                                   \nThe financial services\nindustry is highly\ncompetitive. Our\nsubsidiaries compete\nwith financial services\nproviders such as banks,\nsavings and loan\nassociations, credit\nunions, finance\ncompanies, mortgage\nbanking companies,\ninsurance companies,\ninvestment banks and\nmutual fund companies.\nThey also face increased\ncompetition from nonbank\ninstitutions such as\nbrokerage houses,\nprivate equity firms and\nonline lending\ncompanies, as well as\nfrom financial services\nsubsidiaries of\ncommercial and\nmanufacturing companies.\nMany of these\ncompetitors enjoy fewer\nregulatory constraints\nand some may have lower\ncost structures.\n\nSecurities firms and\ninsurance companies that\nelect to become\nfinancial holding\ncompanies may acquire\nbanks and other\nfinancial institutions.\nCombinations of this\ntype could significantly\nchange the competitive\nenvironment in which we\nconduct business. The\nfinancial services\nindustry is also likely\nto become more\ncompetitive as further\ntechnological advances\nenable more companies to\nprovide financial\nservices. These\ntechnological advances\nmay diminish the\nimportance of\n\ndepository institutions\nand other financial\nintermediaries in the\ntransfer of funds\nbetween parties.\n                                                   \n   REGULATION AND SUPERVISION                      \n                                                   \nWe describe below, and\nin Note 25 (Regulatory\nCapital Requirements and\nOther Restrictions) to\nFinancial Statements\nincluded in the 2022\nAnnual Report to\nShareholders, the\nmaterial elements of the\nregulatory framework\napplicable to us.\nBanking statutes,\nregulations and policies\nare continually under\nreview by Congress and\nstate legislatures and\nfederal and state\nregulatory agencies, as\nwell as non-U.S.\ngovernments and\nfinancial regulators,\nand a change in them,\nincluding changes in how\nthey are interpreted or\nimplemented, could have\na material effect on our\nbusiness. The regulatory\nframework applicable to\ndepository institutions\nand bank holding\ncompanies (BHCs) is\nintended to protect\ndepositors, federal\ndeposit insurance funds,\nconsumers and the\nbanking system as a\nwhole, and not\nnecessarily investors in\nbank holding companies\nsuch as the Company.\n\nStatutes, regulations\nand policies could\nrestrict our ability to\ndiversify into other\nareas of financial\nservices, make\nacquisitions, and pay\ndividends on our capital\nstock. They may also\nrequire us to provide\nfinancial support to one\nor more of our\nsubsidiary banks,\nmaintain capital\nbalances in excess of\namounts desired by\nmanagement, and pay\nhigher deposit insurance\npremiums as a result of\nassessments or a general\ndeterioration in the\nfinancial condition of\ndepository institutions.\nSee the \u201cRegulatory\nMatters\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d sections in the\n2022 Annual Report to\nShareholders for\nadditional information.\n                                                   \n  General                                          \n                                                   \nParent Bank Holding\nCompany. As a BHC, the\nParent is subject to\nregulation under the BHC\nAct and to inspection,\nexamination and\nsupervision by its\nprimary regulator, the\nBoard of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve\nSystem (Federal Reserve\nBoard or FRB). The\nParent is also subject\nto the disclosure and\nregulatory requirements\nof the Securities Act of\n1933, as amended, and\nthe Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, as amended,\nboth as administered by\nthe SEC. As a company\nwith securities listed\non the New York Stock\nExchange (NYSE), the\nParent is subject to the\nrules of the NYSE for\nlisted companies.\n\nSubsidiary Banks. Our\nsubsidiary national\nbanks, and their\nsubsidiaries, are\nsubject to regulation\nand examination\nprimarily by the Office\nof the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (OCC) and\nalso by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC), the\nFRB, the Consumer\nFinancial Protection\nBureau (CFPB), the SEC\nand the Commodities\nFutures Trading\nCommission (CFTC). The\nnon-U.S. branches and\nrepresentative offices\nof our subsidiary\nnational banks are\nsubject to regulation\nand examination by their\nrespective financial\nregulators as well as by\nthe OCC and the FRB.\nNon-U.S. subsidiaries of\nour national bank\nsubsidiaries may be\nsubject to the laws and\nregulations of the\ncountries in which they\nconduct business.\n\nNonbank Subsidiaries.\nMany of our nonbank\nsubsidiaries are also\nsubject to regulation by\nthe FRB and other\napplicable federal and\nstate agencies. Our\ninsurance subsidiaries\nare subject to\nregulation by applicable\nstate insurance\nregulatory agencies, as\nwell as the FRB. Our\nbrokerage subsidiaries\nare regulated by the\nSEC, the Financial\nIndustry Regulatory\nAuthority (FINRA) and,\nin some cases, the CFTC\nand the Municipal\nSecurities Rulemaking\nBoard, and state\nsecurities regulators.\nOur other nonbank\nsubsidiaries may be\nsubject to the laws and\nregulations of the\nfederal government\nand/or the various\nstates as well as\nnon-U.S. countries in\nwhich they conduct\nbusiness or operate.\n                         2                         \n                                                   \n  Parent Bank Holding Company Activities           \n                                                   \n\u201cFinancial in Nature\u201d\nRequirement. We became a\nfinancial holding\ncompany effective March\n13, 2000. We continue to\nmaintain our status as a\nBHC for purposes of\nvarious FRB regulations.\nAs a BHC that has\nelected to be treated as\na financial holding\ncompany pursuant to the\nBHC Act, we may\naffiliate with\nsecurities firms and\ninsurance companies and\nengage in other\nactivities that are\nfinancial in nature or\nincidental or\ncomplementary to\nactivities that are\nfinancial in nature.\n\u201cFinancial in nature\u201d\nactivities include\nsecurities underwriting,\ndealing, and market\nmaking; sponsoring\nmutual funds and\ninvestment companies;\ninsurance underwriting\nand agency; merchant\nbanking; and activities\nthat the FRB, in\nconsultation with the\nSecretary of the U.S.\nTreasury, determines to\nbe financial in nature\nor incidental to such\nfinancial activity.\n\u201cComplementary\nactivities\u201d are\nactivities that the FRB\ndetermines upon\napplication to be\ncomplementary to a\nfinancial activity and\ndo not pose a safety and\nsoundness risk.\n\nFRB approval is\ngenerally not required\nfor us to acquire a\ncompany (other than a\nBHC, bank or savings\nassociation) engaged in\nactivities that are\nfinancial in nature or\nincidental to activities\nthat are financial in\nnature, as determined by\nthe FRB. Prior notice to\nthe FRB may be required,\nhowever, if the company\nto be acquired has total\nconsolidated assets of\n$10 billion or more.\nPrior FRB approval is\nrequired before we may\nacquire the beneficial\nownership or control of\nmore than 5% of the\nvoting shares or\nsubstantially all of the\nassets of a BHC, bank or\nsavings association. In\naddition, the FRB has\nimplemented a final rule\nunder the Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act\n(Dodd-Frank Act) that\nalso prohibits our\nability to merge,\nacquire all or\nsubstantially all of the\nassets of, or acquire\ncontrol of another\ncompany if our total\nresulting consolidated\nliabilities would exceed\n10% of the aggregate\nconsolidated liabilities\nof all financial\ncompanies.\n\nBecause we are a\nfinancial holding\ncompany, if any of our\nsubsidiary banks\nreceives a rating under\nthe Community\nReinvestment Act of\n1977, as amended (CRA),\nof less than\nsatisfactory, we will be\nprohibited, until the\nrating is raised to\nsatisfactory or better,\nfrom engaging in new\nactivities or acquiring\ncompanies other than\nBHCs, banks or savings\nassociations, except\nthat we could engage in\nnew activities, or\nacquire companies\nengaged in activities,\nthat are closely related\nto banking under the BHC\nAct. CRA performance is\nalso taken into account\nby regulators in\nreviewing applications\nto establish bank\nbranches. In addition,\nif the FRB finds that\nthe Company or any one\nof our subsidiary banks\nis not well capitalized\nor well managed, we\nwould be required to\nenter into an agreement\nwith the FRB to comply\nwith all applicable\ncapital and management\nrequirements and which\nmay contain additional\nlimitations or\nconditions. Until\ncorrected, we could be\nprohibited from engaging\nin any new activity or\nacquiring companies\nengaged in activities\nthat are not closely\nrelated to banking under\nthe BHC Act without\nprior FRB approval. If\nwe fail to correct any\nsuch condition within a\nprescribed period, the\nFRB could order us to\ndivest our banking\nsubsidiaries or, in the\nalternative, to cease\nengaging in activities\nother than those closely\nrelated to banking under\nthe BHC Act.\n\nInterstate Banking .\nUnder the Riegle-Neal\nInterstate Banking and\nBranching Act (Riegle-\nNeal Act), a BHC may\nacquire banks in states\nother than its home\nstate, subject to any\nstate requirement that\nthe bank has been\norganized and operating\nfor a minimum period of\ntime, not to exceed five\nyears, and the\nrequirement that the BHC\nnot control, prior to or\nfollowing the proposed\nacquisition, more than\n10% of the total amount\nof\n\ndeposits of insured\ndepository institutions\nnationwide or, unless\nthe acquisition is the\nbank holding company\u2019s\ninitial entry into the\nstate, more than 30% of\nsuch deposits in the\nstate (or such lesser or\ngreater amount set by\nthe state). The Riegle-\nNeal Act also authorizes\nbanks to merge across\nstate lines, subject to\nthe same deposit limits\nnoted above, thereby\ncreating interstate\nbranches. Banks are also\npermitted to acquire and\nto establish new\nbranches in other\nstates.\n\nRegulatory Approval. In\ndetermining whether to\napprove a proposed bank\nacquisition, federal\nbanking regulators will\nconsider, among other\nfactors, the effect of\nthe acquisition on\ncompetition, financial\ncondition, and future\nprospects including\ncurrent and projected\ncapital ratios and\nlevels, the competence,\nexperience, and\nintegrity of management\nand record of compliance\nwith laws and\nregulations, the\nconvenience and needs of\nthe communities to be\nserved, including the\nacquiring institution\u2019s\nrecord of compliance\nunder the CRA, the\neffectiveness of the\nacquiring institution in\ncombating money\nlaundering activities\nand the risk to the\nstability of the United\nStates banking system.\n                                                   \n  Dividend Restrictions                            \n                                                   \nThe Parent is a legal\nentity separate and\ndistinct from its\nsubsidiary banks and\nother subsidiaries. A\nsignificant source of\nfunds to pay dividends\non our common and\npreferred stock and\nprincipal and interest\non our debt is dividends\nfrom the Parent\u2019s\nsubsidiaries. Various\nfederal and state\nstatutory provisions and\nregulations limit the\namount of dividends the\nParent\u2019s subsidiary\nbanks and certain other\nsubsidiaries may pay\nwithout regulatory\napproval. Federal\nbanking regulators have\nthe authority to\nprohibit the Parent\u2019s\nsubsidiary banks from\nengaging in unsafe or\nunsound practices in\nconducting their\nbusinesses. The payment\nof dividends, depending\non the financial\ncondition of the bank in\nquestion, could be\ndeemed an unsafe or\nunsound practice. The\nability of the Parent\u2019s\nsubsidiary banks to pay\ndividends in the future\nis currently, and could\nbe further, influenced\nby bank regulatory\npolicies and capital\nrequirements. For\ninformation about the\nrestrictions applicable\nto the Parent\u2019s\nsubsidiary banks, see\nNote 25 (Regulatory\nCapital Requirements and\nOther Restrictions) to\nFinancial Statements\nincluded in the 2022\nAnnual Report to\nShareholders.\n\nFurthermore, under a\nSupport Agreement dated\nJune 28, 2017, as\namended and restated on\nJune 26, 2019 (the\n\u201cSupport Agreement\u201d),\namong the Parent, WFC\nHoldings, LLC, an\nintermediate holding\ncompany and subsidiary\nof the Parent (the\n\u201cIHC\u201d), Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A., Wells Fargo\nSecurities, LLC, Wells\nFargo Clearing Services,\nLLC, and certain other\nsubsidiaries of the\nParent designated from\ntime to time as material\nentities for resolution\nplanning purposes or\nidentified from time to\ntime as related support\nentities in our\nresolution plan, the IHC\nmay be restricted from\nmaking dividend payments\nto the Parent if certain\nliquidity and/or capital\nmetrics fall below\ndefined triggers, or if\nthe Parent\u2019s board of\ndirectors authorizes it\nto file a case under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nAny such restriction\ncould materially and\nadversely impact the\nParent\u2019s liquidity and\nits ability to satisfy\nits debt and other\nobligations, as well as\nits ability to make\ndividend payments on its\ncommon and preferred\nstock. See the\n\u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d and\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d sections\nof the 2022 Annual\nReport to Shareholders\nfor additional\ninformation on the\nSupport Agreement.\n\nIn addition to these\nrestrictions on the\nability of our\nsubsidiary banks to pay\ndividends to us, the FRB\nrequires large BHCs,\nincluding Wells Fargo,\nto submit annual capital\nplans describing planned\ncapital distributions,\nsuch as the payment of\n                         3                         \ndividends. Large BHCs,\nlike Wells Fargo, and\ntheir insured depository\ninstitutions also must\ncomply with various\ncapital requirements,\nincluding the reforms\nknown as Basel III, as\nwell as rules that\nrequire leverage and\nsupplementary leverage\nratio requirements. We\nare also subject to the\nFRB's rule implementing\nan additional capital\nsurcharge on those U.S.\nbanking organizations,\nsuch as the Company,\nthat are designated as\nglobal systemically\nimportant banks\n(G-SIBs). The failure to\nmeet any of these\nrequirements could\nresult in limitations or\nrestrictions on our\nability to make capital\ndistributions.\n\nIn addition, the FRB\u2019s\nenhanced supervision\nregulations for large\nBHCs, like Wells Fargo,\nimpose capital\ndistribution\nrestrictions, including\non the payment of\ndividends, upon the\noccurrence of capital,\nstress test, risk\nmanagement, or liquidity\nrisk management\ntriggers. For more\ninformation on\nregulations or\narrangements that may\nimpose capital\ndistribution\nrestrictions on the\nCompany and its\nsubsidiaries, see the\n\u201cCapital Management,\u201d\n\u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d and\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d sections\nof the 2022 Annual\nReport to Shareholders.\n                                                   \n  Holding Company Structure                        \n                                                   \nTransfer of Funds from\nSubsidiary Banks. The\nParent\u2019s subsidiary\nbanks are subject to\nrestrictions under\nfederal law that limit\nthe transfer of funds or\nother assets from such\nsubsidiaries to the\nParent and its nonbank\nsubsidiaries (including\naffiliates) in so-called\n\u201ccovered transactions.\u201d\nIn general, covered\ntransactions include\nloans and other\nextensions of credit,\ninvestments and asset\npurchases, as well as\ncertain other\ntransactions involving\nthe transfer of value\nfrom a subsidiary bank\nto an affiliate or for\nthe benefit of an\naffiliate. Unless an\nexemption applies,\ncovered transactions by\na subsidiary bank with a\nsingle affiliate are\nlimited to 10% of the\nsubsidiary bank\u2019s\ncapital and surplus and,\nwith respect to all\ncovered transactions\nwith affiliates in the\naggregate, to 20% of the\nsubsidiary bank\u2019s\ncapital and surplus.\nAlso, loans and\nextensions of credit to\naffiliates generally\nmust be secured by\nqualifying collateral. A\nbank\u2019s transactions with\nits nonbank affiliates\nare also generally\nrequired to be on arm\u2019s\nlength terms. The\nCompany is also subject\nto lending limits and\nqualitative requirements\non loans to executive\nofficers, directors and\nprincipal shareholders\nof the Parent and its\nsubsidiary banks.\n\nSource of Strength. The\nFRB has a policy that a\nBHC is expected to act\nas a source of financial\nand managerial strength\nto each of its\nsubsidiary banks and,\nunder appropriate\ncircumstances, to commit\nresources to support\neach such subsidiary\nbank. This support may\nbe required at times\nwhen the BHC may not\nhave the resources to\nprovide the support.\n\nThe OCC may order an\nassessment of the Parent\nif the capital of one of\nits national bank\nsubsidiaries were to\nbecome impaired. If the\nParent failed to pay the\nassessment within three\nmonths, the OCC could\norder the sale of the\nParent\u2019s stock in the\nnational bank to cover\nthe deficiency.\n\nDepositor Preference. In\nthe event of the\n\u201cliquidation or other\nresolution\u201d of an\ninsured depository\ninstitution, the claims\nof deposits payable in\nthe United States\n(including the claims of\nthe FDIC as subrogee of\ninsured depositors) and\ncertain claims for\nadministrative expenses\nof the FDIC as a\nreceiver will have\npriority over other\ngeneral unsecured claims\nagainst the institution.\nIf an insured depository\ninstitution fails,\nclaims of insured and\nuninsured U.S.\ndepositors, along with\nclaims of the FDIC, will\nhave priority in payment\nahead of unsecured\ncreditors, including the\nParent, and depositors\nwhose deposits are\nsolely payable at such\ninsured depository\ninstitution\u2019s non-U.S.\noffices.\n\nLiability of Commonly\nControlled Institutions.\nThe Company\u2019s\nsubsidiaries include\nbanks in the U.S., such\nas Wells Fargo Bank,\nN.A., that are insured\nby the FDIC. Under the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Act, insured\ndepository institutions\ncan be held liable for\nany loss incurred, or\nreasonably expected to\nbe incurred, by the FDIC\ndue to the default of an\ninsured depository\ninstitution controlled\nby the same BHC, and for\nany assistance provided\nby the FDIC to an\ninsured depository\ninstitution that is in\ndanger of default and\nthat is controlled by\nthe same BHC. \u201cDefault\u201d\nmeans generally the\nappointment of a\nconservator or receiver.\n\u201cIn danger of default\u201d\nmeans generally the\nexistence of certain\nconditions indicating\nthat a default is likely\nto occur in the absence\nof regulatory\nassistance.\n                                                   \n  Dodd-Frank Act                                   \n                                                   \nThe Dodd-Frank Act and\nthe numerous rules to\nimplement its provisions\nhave resulted in\nenhanced regulation and\nsupervision of large\nBHCs, such as Wells\nFargo. This includes,\namong other things,\nrules to promote\nfinancial stability and\nprevent or mitigate the\nrisks that may arise\nfrom the material\ndistress or failure of a\nlarge BHC; enhance\nconsumer protections;\nprohibit proprietary\ntrading; and implement\nenhanced prudential\nrequirements for large\nBHCs regarding risk-\nbased capital and\nleverage, risk and\nliquidity management,\nstress testing, and\nrecovery and resolution\nplanning. The Dodd-Frank\nAct, including current\nand future rules\nimplementing its\nprovisions and the\ninterpretation of those\nrules, has affected, and\nwe expect will continue\nto affect, most of our\nbusinesses in some way,\neither directly through\nregulation of specific\nactivities or indirectly\nthrough regulation of\nconcentration risks,\ncapital or liquidity.\nFor more information\nabout the Dodd-Frank Act\nand its effect on our\nbusiness, see the\n\u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d and\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d sections\nof the 2022 Annual\nReport to Shareholders.\n\nCapital and Liquidity\nRequirements and Capital\nPlanning\n\nThe Company and each of\nour insured depository\ninstitutions are subject\nto various regulatory\ncapital adequacy and\nliquidity requirements\nadministered by federal\nbanking regulators. The\ncapital rules, among\nother things, establish\nrequired minimum ratios\nrelating capital to\ndifferent categories of\nassets and exposures.\nFederal banking\nregulators have also\nimposed a leverage ratio\nand supplementary\nleverage ratio on large\nBHCs, like Wells Fargo,\nand their insured\ndepository institutions,\nas well as a liquidity\ncoverage ratio and a net\nstable funding ratio.\nThe FRB has also\nfinalized rules to\naddress the amount of\nequity and unsecured\nlong-term debt a G-SIB\nmust hold to improve its\nresolvability and\nresiliency, often\nreferred to as total\nloss absorbing capacity.\n\nFrom time to time,\nfederal banking\nregulators propose\nchanges and amendments\nto, and issue\ninterpretations of,\nrisk-based capital\nrequirements and related\nreporting instructions.\nIn addition, the FRB\nclosely monitors capital\nlevels of the\ninstitutions it\nsupervises and may\nrequire such\ninstitutions to modify\ncapital levels based on\nFRB determinations. Such\ndeterminations,\nproposals or\ninterpretations could,\nif implemented in the\nfuture, affect our\nreported capital ratios\nand net risk-adjusted\nassets.\n\nAs an additional means\nto identify problems in\nthe financial management\nof depository\ninstitutions, the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Act (FDI Act)\nrequires federal banking\nregulators to establish\ncertain non-capital\nsafety and soundness\nstandards for\ninstitutions for which\nthey are the primary\nfederal regulator. The\nstandards relate\ngenerally to operations\nand management, asset\nquality, interest rate\nexposure, executive\ncompensation and risk\n                         4                         \nmanagement. Federal\nbanking regulators are\nauthorized to take\naction against\ninstitutions that fail\nto meet such standards.\n\nThe FDI Act requires\nfederal banking\nregulators to take\n\u201cprompt corrective\naction\u201d with respect to\nFDIC-insured depository\ninstitutions that do not\nmeet minimum capital\nrequirements. A\ndepository institution\u2019s\ntreatment for purposes\nof the prompt corrective\naction provisions will\ndepend upon how its\ncapital levels compare\nto various capital\nmeasures and certain\nother factors, as\nestablished by\nregulation.\n\nIn addition, the FRB\u2019s\ncapital plan rule\nestablishes capital\nplanning and other\nrequirements that govern\ncapital distributions,\nincluding dividends and\nshare repurchases, by\ncertain BHCs, including\nWells Fargo. Federal\nbanking regulators also\nrequire stress tests to\nevaluate whether an\ninstitution has\nsufficient capital to\ncontinue to operate\nduring periods of\nadverse economic and\nfinancial conditions.\n\nFor more information on\nour capital requirements\nand planning, see the\n\u201cCapital Management\u201d\nsection of the 2022\nAnnual Report to\nShareholders.\n                                                   \n  Deposit Insurance Assessments                    \n                                                   \nThe Company\u2019s\nsubsidiaries include\nbanks, such as Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A., that\nare insured by the FDIC.\nThrough the Deposit\nInsurance Fund (DIF)\nmaintained by the FDIC,\nthe FDIC insures the\ndeposits of our insured\nbanks up to prescribed\nlimits for each\ndepositor and funds the\nDIF through assessments\non member banks. To\nmaintain the DIF, member\ninstitutions are\nassessed an insurance\npremium based on an\nassessment base and an\nassessment rate.\n\nThe FDIC has adopted a\ncomprehensive, long-\nrange plan for DIF\nmanagement, targeting a\ndesignated reserve ratio\nof 2%. For the year\nended December 31, 2022,\nthe Company's FDIC\ndeposit insurance\nassessments totaled $679\nmillion.\n\nThe FDIC may terminate a\ndepository institution\u2019s\ndeposit insurance upon a\nfinding that the\ninstitution\u2019s financial\ncondition is unsafe or\nunsound or that the\ninstitution or its\ndirectors have engaged\nin unsafe or unsound\npractices or have\nviolated any applicable\nlaw, regulation, order\nor condition enacted or\nimposed by the\ninstitution\u2019s regulatory\nagency. The termination\nof deposit insurance for\none or more of our bank\nsubsidiaries could have\na material adverse\neffect on our earnings,\ndepending on the\ncollective size of the\nparticular banks\ninvolved.\n                                                   \n  Fiscal and Monetary Policies                     \n                                                   \nOur business and\nearnings are affected\nsignificantly by the\nfiscal and monetary\npolicies of the federal\ngovernment and its\nagencies. We are\nparticularly affected by\nthe monetary policies of\nthe FRB, which regulates\nthe supply of money and\ncredit in the United\nStates. Among the\ninstruments of monetary\npolicy available to the\nFRB are (a) conducting\nopen market operations\nin United States\ngovernment securities,\n(b) changing the\ndiscount rates of\nborrowings of depository\ninstitutions, (c)\nimposing or changing\nreserve requirements\nagainst depository\ninstitutions\u2019 deposits,\nand (d) imposing or\nchanging reserve\nrequirements against\ncertain borrowings by\nbanks and their\naffiliates. These\nmethods are used in\nvarying degrees and\ncombinations to directly\naffect the availability\nof bank loans and\ndeposits, as well as the\ninterest rates charged\non loans and paid on\ndeposits. The policies\nof the FRB may have a\nmaterial effect on our\nbusiness, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition.\n\nPrivacy Provisions of\nthe Gramm-Leach-Bliley\nAct and Restrictions on\nAffiliate Marketing\n\nFederal banking\nregulators, as required\nunder the Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act (the GLB\nAct), have adopted rules\nlimiting the ability of\n\nbanks and other\nfinancial institutions\nto disclose nonpublic\ninformation about\nconsumers to\nnonaffiliated third\nparties. The rules\nrequire disclosure of\nprivacy policies to\nconsumers and, in some\ncircumstances, allow\nconsumers to prevent\ndisclosure of certain\npersonal information to\nnonaffiliated third\nparties. The privacy\nprovisions of the GLB\nAct affect how consumer\ninformation is\ntransmitted through\ndiversified financial\nservices companies and\nconveyed to outside\nvendors. Federal\nfinancial regulators\nhave issued regulations\nunder the Fair and\nAccurate Credit\nTransactions Act that\nhave the effect of\nincreasing the length of\nthe waiting period,\nafter privacy\ndisclosures are provided\nto new customers, before\ninformation can be\nshared among different\naffiliated companies for\nthe purpose of marketing\nproducts and services by\nthose affiliated\ncompanies.\n                                                   \n  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002                       \n                                                   \nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nof 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley)\nimplemented a broad\nrange of corporate\ngovernance and\naccounting measures to\nincrease corporate\nresponsibility, to\nprovide for enhanced\npenalties for accounting\nand auditing\nimproprieties at\npublicly traded\ncompanies, and to\nprotect investors by\nimproving the accuracy\nand reliability of\ndisclosures under\nfederal securities laws.\nWe are subject to\nSarbanes-Oxley because\nwe are required to file\nperiodic reports with\nthe SEC under the\nSecurities Exchange Act\nof 1934. Among other\nthings, Sarbanes-Oxley\nand/or its implementing\nregulations established\nmembership requirements\nand additional\nresponsibilities for our\naudit committee, imposed\nrestrictions on the\nrelationship between us\nand our outside auditors\n(including restrictions\non the types of non-\naudit services our\nauditors may provide to\nus), imposed additional\nresponsibilities for our\nexternal financial\nstatements on our chief\nexecutive officer and\nchief financial officer,\nexpanded the disclosure\nrequirements for our\ncorporate insiders,\nrequired our management\nto evaluate our\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures and our\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting, and\nrequired our independent\nregistered public\naccounting firm to issue\na report on our internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting.\n                                                   \n  USA PATRIOT Act                                  \n                                                   \nThe Uniting and\nStrengthening America by\nProviding Appropriate\nTools Required to\nIntercept and Obstruct\nTerrorism Act of 2001\n(USA PATRIOT Act) is\nintended to strengthen\nthe ability of U.S. law\nenforcement agencies and\nintelligence communities\nto work together to\ncombat terrorism on a\nvariety of fronts. The\nUSA PATRIOT Act has\nsignificant implications\nfor depository\ninstitutions, brokers,\ndealers and other\nbusinesses involved in\nthe transfer of money.\nThe USA PATRIOT Act\nrequires the\nimplementation of\npolicies and procedures\nrelating to anti\u2011money\nlaundering, economic\nsanctions, suspicious\nactivities, and currency\ntransaction reporting\nand due diligence on\ncustomers. The USA\nPATRIOT Act also\nrequires federal banking\nregulators to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of an\napplicant in combating\nmoney laundering in\ndetermining whether to\napprove a proposed bank\nacquisition.\n                                                   \n  Future Legislation or Regulation                 \n                                                   \nEconomic, market and\npolitical conditions\nduring the past several\nyears have led to a\nsignificant amount of\nlegislation and\nregulation in the U.S.\nand abroad affecting the\nfinancial services\nindustry, as well as\nheightened expectations\nand scrutiny of\nfinancial services\ncompanies from banking\nregulators. Further\nlegislative changes and\nadditional regulations\nmay change our operating\nenvironment in\nsubstantial and\nunpredictable ways. Such\nlegislation and\nregulations could\nincrease our cost of\ndoing business, affect\nour compensation\nstructure, restrict or\nexpand\n                         5                         \nthe activities in which we may engage or affect the\ncompetitive balance among banks, savings\nassociations, credit unions, and other financial\ninstitutions.

At\nDecember 31, 2022, we had remaining Board authority\nto repurchase approximately 250 million shares of\ncommon stock, subject to regulatory and legal\nconditions. The authorizations cover shares\nrepurchased to meet employee benefit plan\nrequirements. The Company maintains a variety of\nretirement plans for its employees and typically is\na net issuer of shares of common stock to these\nplans. From time to time, it also purchases shares\nof common stock from these plans to accommodate\nemployee preferences. Share repurchases are\nsubtracted from the Company\u2019s repurchase authority\nwithout offset for share issuances. Shares may be\nrepurchased from the different benefit plans or in\nthe open market, subject to regulatory approval.\nThe amount and timing of stock repurchases will be\nbased on various factors, including our capital\nrequirements, the number of shares we expect to\nissue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions,\nmarket conditions (including the trading price of\nour stock), and regulatory and legal\nconsiderations. See the \u201cCapital Management\u201d\nsection in the 2022 Annual Report to Shareholders\nfor additional information about our common stock\nrepurchases.

Under the\nDeferred Compensation\nPlan, eligible employees\nmay defer receipt of\nsalary, bonuses and\ncertain other\ncompensation subject to\nthe terms of the plan.\n\nDeferral elections are\nirrevocable once made\nexcept for limited re-\ndeferral opportunities.\nWe treat amounts\ndeferred by a\nparticipant as if\ninvested in the earnings\noptions selected by the\nparticipant, and\ndetermine the deferred\ncompensation benefit\npayable to the\nparticipant based on the\nperformance of those\nearnings options. The\nplan offers a number of\nearnings options,\n                        11                         \nincluding one based on our common stock with\ndividends reinvested. We generally distribute\namounts allocated to the common stock option in\nshares of common stock. Participants have no direct\ninterest in any of the earnings options and are\ngeneral unsecured creditors of the Company with\nrespect to their deferred compensation benefits\nunder the plan. Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation\nPlan for Independent Contractors . Under the Non-\nQualified Deferred Compensation Plan for\nIndependent Contractors participants who performed\nqualifying investment or other financial services\nfor participating affiliates as independent\ncontractors were able to defer all or part of their\neligible compensation payable to them by the\naffiliate subject to the terms of the plan.\nDeferral elections were irrevocable once made.\nAmounts deferred by a participant were treated as\nif invested in the earnings options selected by the\nparticipant, which determine the deferred\ncompensation benefit payable to the participant.\nThe plan offered a number of earnings options,\nincluding one based on our common stock with\ndividends reinvested. We generally distribute\namounts allocated to the common stock option in\nshares of common stock. No future deferrals may be\nmade under this plan and participants may no longer\nreallocate their existing account balances under\nthe plan among different investment options. Shares\nremaining available for issuance under the plan\nconsist of shares issuable as a result of amounts\ncredited to participant accounts denominated in our\ncommon stock to reflect cash dividends paid on the\ncommon stock. The plan is sponsored by a wholly\nowned subsidiary, WF Deferred Compensation\nHoldings, Inc. We have guaranteed its obligations\nunder the plan. Participants have no direct\ninterest in any of the earnings options and are\ngeneral unsecured creditors of the plan sponsor and\nthe Company with respect to their deferred\ncompensation benefits under the plan. Norwest\nCorporation Directors\u2019 Formula Stock Award Plan .\nUnder the Norwest Corporation Directors\u2019 Formula\nStock Award Plan we awarded shares of common stock\nto non-employee directors. The plan allowed\nparticipants to defer receipt of all or a portion\nof their awards, with dividends reinvested, until a\nfuture year or years as selected by the\nparticipants subject to the terms of the plan.\nParticipants can elect one time to defer\ncommencement of distribution of their deferral\naccounts if the election is made sufficiently in\nadvance of the original distribution commencement\ndate and the new distribution commencement date is\nsufficiently beyond the original distribution\ncommencement date. Participants have no direct\ninterest in the shares deferred under the plan and\nare general unsecured creditors of the Company with\nrespect to payment of their deferred stock awards\nunder the plan. No future stock awards or deferrals\nmay be made under this plan.
