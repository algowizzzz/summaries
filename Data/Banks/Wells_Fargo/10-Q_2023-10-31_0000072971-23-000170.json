We\nadopted ASU 2018-12 with retrospective application,\nwhich required revision of prior period financial\nstatements. Prior period risk-based capital and\ncertain other regulatory related metrics were not\nrevised. For additional information, including the\nfinancial statement line items impacted by the\nadoption of ASU 2018-12, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) to Financial\nStatements in this Report.\n\n(2) Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is total\nrevenue less noninterest expense. Management\nbelieves that PTPP is a useful financial measure\nbecause it enables investors and others to assess\nthe Company\u2019s ability to generate capital to cover\ncredit losses through a credit cycle.\n\n(3) Includes provision for credit losses for loans,\ndebt securities, and other financial assets.\n\n(4) Book value per common share is common\nstockholders\u2019 equity divided by common shares\noutstanding. Tangible book value per common share\nis tangible common equity divided by common shares\noutstanding.\n\n(5) Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure and represents total equity less preferred\nequity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain\nidentifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage\nservicing rights) and goodwill and other\nintangibles on investments in consolidated\nportfolio companies, net of applicable deferred\ntaxes. The methodology of determining tangible\ncommon equity may differ among companies.\nManagement believes that return on average tangible\ncommon equity and tangible book value per common\nshare, which utilize tangible common equity, are\nuseful financial measures because they enable\nmanagement, investors, and others to assess the\nCompany\u2019s use of equity. For additional\ninformation, including a corresponding\nreconciliation to generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (GAAP) financial measures, see the\n\u201cCapital Management \u2013 Tangible Common Equity\u201d\nsection in this Report.\n\n(6) Represents Wells Fargo net income divided by\naverage assets.\n\n(7) Represents Wells Fargo net income applicable to\ncommon stock divided by average common\nstockholders\u2019 equity.\n\n(8) The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense\ndivided by total revenue (net interest income and\nnoninterest income).\n\n(9) For additional information, see the \u201cCapital\nManagement\u201d section and Note 21 (Regulatory Capital\nRequirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial\nStatements in this Report.\n\n(10) Represents TLAC divided by RWAs, which is our\nbinding TLAC ratio, determined by using the greater\nof RWAs under the Standardized and Advanced\nApproaches.\n\n(11) Represents average high-quality liquid assets\ndivided by average projected net cash outflows, as\neach is defined under the LCR rule.\n                              \n  2    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                              \nThis Quarterly Report, including the Financial\nReview and the Financial Statements and related\nNotes, contains forward-looking statements, which\nmay include forecasts of our financial results and\ncondition, expectations for our operations and\nbusiness, and our assumptions for those forecasts\nand expectations. Do not unduly rely on forward-\nlooking statements. Actual results may differ\nmaterially from our forward-looking statements due\nto several factors.

See the \u201cGlossary of Acronyms\u201d for\ndefinitions of terms used throughout this Report.\n                                                   \n   Financial Review                                \n                                                   \n            \n  Overview  \n            \nWells Fargo & Company is\na leading financial\nservices company that\nhas approximately $1.9\ntrillion in assets,\nproudly serves one in\nthree U.S. households\nand more than 10% of\nsmall businesses in the\nU.S., and is a leading\nmiddle market banking\nprovider in the U.S. We\nprovide a diversified\nset of banking,\ninvestment and mortgage\nproducts and services,\nas well as consumer and\ncommercial finance,\nthrough our four\nreportable operating\nsegments: Consumer\nBanking and Lending,\nCommercial Banking,\nCorporate and Investment\nBanking, and Wealth and\nInvestment Management.\nWells Fargo ranked No.\n47 on Fortune\u2019s 2023\nrankings of America\u2019s\nlargest corporations. We\nranked fourth in assets\nand third in the market\nvalue of our common\nstock among all U.S.\nbanks at September 30,\n2023.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s top\npriority remains\nbuilding a risk and\ncontrol infrastructure\nappropriate for its size\nand complexity. The\nCompany is subject to a\nnumber of consent orders\nand other regulatory\nactions, which may\nrequire the Company,\namong other things, to\nundertake certain\nchanges to its business,\noperations, products and\nservices, and risk\nmanagement practices.\nAddressing these\nregulatory actions is\nexpected to take\nmultiple years, and we\nare likely to continue\nto experience issues or\ndelays along the way in\nsatisfying their\nrequirements. We are\nalso likely to continue\nto identify more issues\nas we implement our risk\nand control\ninfrastructure, which\nmay result in additional\nregulatory actions.\nIssues or delays with\none regulatory action\ncould affect our\nprogress on others, and\nregulators have\nindicated the potential\nfor escalating\nconsequences for banks\nthat do not timely\nresolve open issues.\nFailure to satisfy the\nrequirements of a\nregulatory action on a\ntimely basis could\nresult in additional\npenalties, business\nrestrictions,\nlimitations on\nsubsidiary capital\ndistributions, increased\ncapital or liquidity\nrequirements,\nenforcement actions, and\nother negative\nconsequences, which\ncould be significant.\nWhile we still have\nsignificant work to do\nand have not yet\nsatisfied certain\naspects of these\nregulatory actions, the\nCompany is committed to\ndevoting the resources\nnecessary to operate\nwith strong business\npractices and controls,\nmaintain the highest\nlevel of integrity, and\nhave an appropriate\nculture in place.\n\nFederal Reserve Board\nConsent Order Regarding\nGovernance Oversight and\nCompliance and\nOperational Risk\nManagement\n\nOn February 2, 2018, the\nCompany entered into a\nconsent order with the\nBoard of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve\nSystem (FRB). As\nrequired by the consent\norder, the Company\u2019s\nBoard of Directors\n(Board) submitted to the\nFRB a plan to further\nenhance the Board\u2019s\ngovernance and oversight\nof the Company, and the\nCompany submitted to the\nFRB a plan to further\nimprove the\n\nCompany\u2019s compliance and\noperational risk\nmanagement program. The\nCompany continues to\nengage with the FRB as\nthe Company works to\naddress the consent\norder provisions. The\nconsent order also\nrequires the Company,\nfollowing the FRB\u2019s\nacceptance and approval\nof the plans and the\nCompany\u2019s adoption and\nimplementation of the\nplans, to complete an\ninitial third-party\nreview of the\nenhancements and\nimprovements provided\nfor in the plans. Until\nthis third-party review\nis complete and the\nplans are approved and\nimplemented to the\nsatisfaction of the FRB,\nthe Company\u2019s total\nconsolidated assets as\ndefined under the\nconsent order will be\nlimited to the level as\nof December 31, 2017.\nCompliance with this\nasset cap is measured on\na two-quarter daily\naverage basis to allow\nfor management of\ntemporary fluctuations.\nAfter removal of the\nasset cap, a second\nthird-party review must\nalso be conducted to\nassess the efficacy and\nsustainability of the\nenhancements and\nimprovements.\n\nConsent Orders with the\nConsumer Financial\nProtection Bureau and\nOffice of the\nComptroller of the\nCurrency Regarding\nCompliance Risk\nManagement Program,\nAutomobile Collateral\nProtection Insurance\nPolicies, and Mortgage\nInterest Rate Lock\nExtensions\n\nOn April 20, 2018, the\nCompany entered into\nconsent orders with the\nConsumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (CFPB)\nand the Office of the\nComptroller of the\nCurrency (OCC) to pay an\naggregate of $1 billion\nin civil money penalties\nto resolve matters\nregarding the Company\u2019s\ncompliance risk\nmanagement program and\npast practices involving\ncertain automobile\ncollateral protection\ninsurance (CPI) policies\nand certain mortgage\ninterest rate lock\nextensions. As required\nby the consent orders,\nthe Company submitted to\nthe CFPB and OCC an\nenterprise-wide\ncompliance risk\nmanagement plan and a\nplan to enhance the\nCompany\u2019s internal audit\nprogram with respect to\nfederal consumer\nfinancial law and the\nterms of the consent\norders. In addition, as\nrequired by the consent\norders, the Company\nsubmitted for non-\nobjection plans to\nremediate customers\naffected by the\nautomobile collateral\nprotection insurance and\nmortgage interest rate\nlock matters, as well as\na plan for the\nmanagement of\nremediation activities\nconducted by the\nCompany. The Company\ncontinues to work to\naddress the provisions\nof the consent orders.\nOn September 9, 2021,\nthe OCC assessed a $250\nmillion civil money\npenalty against the\nCompany related to\ninsufficient progress in\naddressing requirements\nunder the OCC\u2019s April\n2018 consent order and\nloss mitigation\nactivities in the\nCompany\u2019s Home Lending\nbusiness. On December\n20, 2022, the CFPB\nmodified its consent\norder to clarify how it\nwould terminate.\n                              \n  Wells Fargo & Company    3  \n                              \n                                                   \n  Overview(continued)                              \n                                                   \nConsent Order with the\nOCC Regarding Loss\nMitigation Activities\n\nOn September 9, 2021,\nthe Company entered into\na consent order with the\nOCC requiring the\nCompany to improve the\nexecution, risk\nmanagement, and\noversight of loss\nmitigation activities in\nits Home Lending\nbusiness. In addition,\nthe consent order\nrestricts the Company\nfrom acquiring certain\nthird-party residential\nmortgage servicing and\nlimits transfers of\ncertain mortgage loans\nrequiring customer\nremediation out of the\nCompany\u2019s mortgage\nservicing portfolio\nuntil remediation is\nprovided.\n\nConsent Order with the\nCFPB Regarding\nAutomobile Lending,\nConsumer Deposit\nAccounts, and Mortgage\nLending\n\nOn December 20, 2022,\nthe Company entered into\na consent order with the\nCFPB requiring the\nCompany to provide\ncustomer remediation for\nmultiple matters related\nto automobile lending,\nconsumer deposit\naccounts, and mortgage\nlending; maintain\npractices designed to\nensure auto lending\ncustomers receive\nrefunds for the unused\nportion of certain\nguaranteed automobile\nprotection agreements;\ncomply with certain\nbusiness practice\nrequirements related to\nconsumer deposit\naccounts; and pay a $1.7\nbillion civil penalty to\nthe CFPB. The required\nactions related to many\nof these matters were\nalready substantially\ncomplete at the time we\nentered into the consent\norder, and the consent\norder lays out a path to\ntermination after the\nCompany completes the\nremainder of the\nrequired actions.\n                                                   \n  Retail Sales Practices Matters                   \n                                                   \nIn September 2016, we\nannounced settlements\nwith the CFPB, the OCC,\nand the Office of the\nLos Angeles City\nAttorney, and entered\ninto related consent\norders with the CFPB and\nthe OCC, in connection\nwith allegations that\nsome of our retail\ncustomers received\nproducts and services\nthey did not request. As\na result, it remains a\npriority to rebuild\ntrust through a\ncomprehensive action\nplan that includes\nmaking things right for\nour customers,\nemployees, and other\nstakeholders, and\nbuilding a better\nCompany for the future.\nOn September 8, 2021,\nthe CFPB consent order\nregarding retail sales\npractices expired.\n\nFor additional\ninformation regarding\nretail sales practices\nmatters, including\nrelated legal and\nregulatory risk, see the\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d section\nin our 2022 Form 10-K.\n                                                   \n  Customer Remediation Activities                  \n                                                   \nOur priority of\nrebuilding trust has\nincluded an effort to\nidentify areas or\ninstances where\ncustomers may have\nexperienced financial\nharm, provide\nremediation as\nappropriate, and\nimplement additional\noperational and control\nprocedures. We are\nworking with our\nregulatory agencies in\nthis effort.\n\nWe have accrued for the\nprobable and estimable\ncosts related to our\ncustomer remediation\nactivities, which\namounts may change based\non additional facts and\ninformation, as well as\nongoing reviews and\ncommunications with our\nregulators. We had\napproximately $1.5\nbillion and\napproximately $2.3\nbillion of accrued\nliabilities for customer\nremediation activities\nas of September 30,\n2023, and December 31,\n2022, respectively. As\nour ongoing reviews\ncontinue and as we\ncontinue to strengthen\nour risk and control\ninfrastructure, we have\nidentified and may in\nthe future identify\nadditional items or\nareas of potential\nconcern. To the extent\nissues are identified,\nwe will continue to\nassess any customer harm\nand provide remediation\nas appropriate. We have\npreviously disclosed key\nareas of focus as part\nof these activities.\n\nFor additional\ninformation regarding\nthese activities,\n\nincluding related legal\nand regulatory risk, see\nthe \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nsection in our 2022 Form\n10-K.\n                                                   \n  Recent Developments                              \n                                                   \n                                                   \n  Debit Card Interchange Fees                      \n                                                   \nOn October 25, 2023, the\nFRB issued a proposed\nrule that would reduce\nthe amount of debit card\ninterchange fees\nreceived by debit card\nissuers. In addition,\nthe proposed rule would\nallow for an update to\nthe debit card\ninterchange fee cap\nevery other year based\non an analysis of\ncertain costs incurred\nby debit card issuers.\nBased on a preliminary\nassessment, we expect a\nsignificant reduction to\nour debit card\ninterchange fees, which\nare included in card\nfees, if the rule is\nadopted as currently\nproposed.\n\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nSpecial Assessment\n\nIn May 2023, the Federal\nDeposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC)\nproposed a rule to\nrecover by special\nassessment losses to the\nFDIC deposit insurance\nfund as a result of bank\nfailures in the first\nhalf of 2023. Under the\nproposed rule, the FDIC\nwould collect a special\nassessment based on a\ncalculation using an\ninsured depository\ninstitution\u2019s estimated\namount of uninsured\ndeposits. As currently\nproposed, the amount of\nour special assessment\nmay be up to $1.8\nbillion (pre-tax). We\nexpect to expense the\nentire amount upon the\nFDIC\u2019s finalization of\nthe rule, which we\nexpect to occur in\nfourth quarter 2023. The\nproposed rule may be\nchanged prior to\nfinalization and any\nchanges may affect the\ntiming or amount of the\nspecial assessment.\n                                                   \n  Capital Matters                                  \n                                                   \nOn July 27, 2023,\nfederal banking\nregulators issued a\nproposed rule that would\nimpact the way in which\nrisk-based capital\nrequirements are\ndetermined for certain\nbanks. The proposed rule\nwould eliminate the\ncurrent Advanced\nApproach and replace it\nwith a new expanded\nrisk-based approach for\nthe measurement of risk-\nweighted assets,\nincluding more granular\nrisk weights for credit\nrisk, a new market risk\nframework, and a new\nstandardized approach\nfor measuring\noperational risk. The\nnew requirements would\nbe phased in over a\nthree-year period\nbeginning July 1, 2025.\nThe Company expects a\nsignificant increase in\nits risk-weighted assets\nand a net increase in\nits capital requirements\nbased on an assessment\nof the proposed rule.\nThe Company is\nconsidering a range of\npotential actions to\naddress the impact of\nthe proposed rule,\nincluding balance sheet\nand capital optimization\nstrategies.\n\nFor additional\ninformation about\ncapital planning, see\nthe \u201cCapital Management\n\u2013 Capital Planning and\nStress Testing\u201d section\nin this Report.\n                                                   \n  Financial Performance                            \n                                                   \n                                                   \n  Adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2018-12  \n                                                   \nIn first quarter 2023,\nwe adopted Financial\nAccounting Standards\nBoard (FASB) Accounting\nStandards Update (ASU)\n2018-12 \u2013 Financial\nServices \u2013 Insurance\n(Topic 944): Targeted\nImprovements to the\nAccounting for Long-\nDuration Contracts .\n\nWe adopted this ASU with\nretrospective\napplication, which\nrequired revision of\nprior period financial\nstatements.

Effective\nJanuary 1, 2023,\nmanagement modified its\ncapital allocation\nmethodology to improve\nalignment of allocated\ncapital with the binding\nregulatory constraints\nof the Company.\nManagement believes that\nreturn on allocated\ncapital is a useful\nfinancial measure\nbecause it enables\nmanagement, investors,\nand others to assess a\nreportable operating\nsegment\u2019s use of\ncapital.\n\nSelected Metrics We\npresent certain\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial metrics\nthat management uses\nwhen evaluating\nreportable operating\nsegment results.\nManagement believes that\nthese metrics are useful\nto investors and others\nto assess the\nperformance, customer\ngrowth, and trends of\nreportable operating\nsegments or lines of\nbusiness.\n                                                   \n   Table 5:                                        \n                                                   \n                                                   \n   Management Reporting Structure                  \n                                                   \n                                                   \n  W\u2026                                               \n  F\u2026                                               \n  &                                                \n  C\u2026                                               \n        Co\u2026            Co\u2026    Wea\u2026                 \n        Ba\u2026    Com\u2026    and    and     Co\u2026          \n        and    Ban\u2026    In\u2026    Inv\u2026                 \n        Le\u2026            Ba\u2026    Man\u2026                 \n                                             \u2022     \n        \u2022                                    Cor\u2026  \n        Co\u2026                                  Tre\u2026  \n        Sm\u2026                                  \u2022     \n        and                                  Ent\u2026  \n        Bu\u2026    \u2022       \u2022      \u2022              Fun\u2026  \n        Ba\u2026    Mid\u2026    Ba\u2026    Wel\u2026           \u2022     \n        \u2022      Mar\u2026    \u2022      Far\u2026           Inv\u2026  \n        Ho\u2026    Ban\u2026    Co\u2026    Adv\u2026           Por\u2026  \n        Le\u2026    \u2022       Re\u2026    \u2022              \u2022     \n        \u2022      Ass\u2026    Es\u2026    The            Ven\u2026  \n        Cr\u2026    Len\u2026    \u2022      Pri\u2026           cap\u2026  \n        Ca\u2026    and     Ma\u2026    Bank           and   \n        \u2022      Lea\u2026                          pri\u2026  \n        Au\u2026                                  equ\u2026  \n        \u2022                                    inv\u2026  \n        Pe\u2026                                  \u2022     \n        Le\u2026                                  Non\u2026  \n                                             bus\u2026  \n                                                   \n                               \n  12    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 6 and the\nfollowing discussion\npresent our results by\nreportable operating\nsegment.

Unfunded\ncredit commitments were\n$8.2 billion and $8.8\nbillion at September 30,\n2023, and December 31,\n2022, respectively, for\nCRE mortgage loans and\n$14.6 billion and $20.7\nbillion, respectively,\nfor CRE construction\nloans.\n\nWe generally subject CRE\nloans to individual risk\nassessment using our\ninternal borrower and\ncollateral quality\nratings. We had $16.7\nbillion of CRE mortgage\nloans classified as\ncriticized at\n\nSeptember 30, 2023,\ncompared with $11.3\nbillion at December 31,\n2022, and $1.3 billion\nof CRE construction\nloans classified as\ncriticized at September\n30, 2023, compared with\n$1.1 billion at December\n31, 2022. The increase\nin criticized CRE loans\nwas predominantly driven\nby the office and\napartments property\ntypes. The credit\nquality of the office\nproperty type continued\nto be adversely affected\nas weakened demand for\noffice space continued\nto drive higher vacancy\nrates and deteriorating\noperating performance.\nWe continue to closely\nmonitor this portfolio.\nAt September 30, 2023,\nnearly one-third of the\nCRE loans in the office\nproperty type had\nrecourse to a guarantor,\ntypically through a\nrepayment guarantee, in\naddition to the related\ncollateral. Loans in\nCalifornia and New York\nrepresented\napproximately 40% of the\noffice property type at\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n\nTable 13 provides our\nCRE loans by state and\nproperty type.\n                                                   \n  Table 13:                                        \n                                                   \n                                                   \n  CRE Loans by State and Property Type             \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n* Less than 1%.\n\n(1) Total commitments consist of loans outstanding\nplus unfunded credit commitments, excluding issued\nletters of credit.

Additionally, we\nmaintain an ACL for debt\nsecurities classified as\neither AFS or HTM, other\nfinancial assets\nmeasured at amortized\ncost, including deposits\nwith banks, net\ninvestments in leases,\nand other off-balance\nsheet credit exposures.\n\nThe process for\nestablishing the ACL for\nloans takes into\nconsideration many\nfactors, including\nhistorical and\nforecasted loss trends,\nloan-level credit\nquality ratings and loan\ngrade-specific\ncharacteristics. The\nprocess involves\nsubjective and complex\njudgments. In addition,\nwe review a variety of\ncredit metrics and\ntrends. These credit\nmetrics and trends,\nhowever, do not solely\ndetermine the amount of\nthe allowance as we use\nseveral analytical\ntools.

The ACL\nfor loans increased $1.5\nbillion, or 11%, from\nDecember 31, 2022,\nreflecting increases for\ncommercial real estate\nloans, primarily office\nloans, as well as for\nincreases in credit card\nloan balances, partially\noffset by a decrease for\nresidential mortgage\nloans related to the\nadoption of ASU 2022-02,\nFinancial Instruments \u2013\nCredit Losses (Topic\n326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and\nVintage Disclosures .\nFor additional\ninformation on ASU\n2022-02, see Note 1\n(Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) to\nFinancial Statements in\nthis Report. The detail\nof the changes in the\nACL for loans by\nportfolio segment\n(including charge-offs\nand recoveries by loan\nclass) is included in\nNote 5 (Loans and\nRelated Allowance for\nCredit Losses) to\nFinancial Statements in\nthis Report. We consider\nmultiple economic\nscenarios to develop our\nestimate of the ACL for\nloans, which generally\ninclude a base scenario,\nalong with an optimistic\n(upside) and one or more\npessimistic (downside)\nscenarios. We weighted\nthe base scenario and\nthe downside scenarios\nin our estimate of the\nACL for loans at\nSeptember 30, 2023. The\nbase scenario assumed\nelevated inflation and\neconomic contraction in\nthe near term,\nreflecting declining\nproperty values and\nincreased unemployment\nrates from historically\nlow levels.

Future\namounts of the ACL for\nloans will be based on a\nvariety of factors,\nincluding loan balance\nchanges, portfolio\ncredit quality and mix\nchanges, and changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions and\nexpectations (including\nfor unemployment and\nreal GDP), among other\nfactors.\n                               \n  38    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nWe believe the ACL for\nloans of $15.1 billion\nat September 30, 2023,\nwas appropriate to cover\nexpected credit losses,\nincluding unfunded\ncredit commitments, at\nthat date. The entire\nallowance is available\nto absorb credit losses\nfrom the total loan\nportfolio. The ACL for\nloans is subject to\nchange and reflects\nexisting factors as of\nthe date of\ndetermination, including\neconomic or market\nconditions and ongoing\ninternal and external\nexamination processes.\nDue to the sensitivity\nof the ACL for loans to\nchanges in the economic\nand business\nenvironment, it is\npossible that we will\nincur incremental credit\nlosses not anticipated\nas of the balance sheet\ndate. Our process for\ndetermining the ACL is\ndiscussed in the\n\u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies \u2013 Allowance for\nCredit Losses\u201d section\nand Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial\nStatements in our 2022\nForm 10-K.\n\nMORTGAGE BANKING\nACTIVITIES We sell\nresidential and\ncommercial mortgage\nloans to various\nparties. In connection\nwith our sales and\nsecuritization of\nresidential mortgage\nloans, we have\nestablished a mortgage\nrepurchase liability.\nFor information on our\nrepurchase liability,\nsee the \u201cRisk Management\n\u2013 Credit Risk Management\n\u2013 Mortgage Banking\nActivities\u201d section in\nour 2022 Form 10-K.\n\nIn addition to servicing\nloans in our portfolio,\nwe act as servicer\nand/or master servicer\nof residential and\ncommercial mortgage\nloans included in GSE\nmortgage\nsecuritizations, GNMA-\nguaranteed mortgage\nsecuritizations of FHA-\ninsured/VA-guaranteed\nmortgages and private\nlabel mortgage\nsecuritizations, as well\nas for unsecuritized\nloans owned by\ninstitutional investors.\n\nAs a servicer, we are\nrequired to advance\ncertain delinquent\npayments of principal\nand interest on mortgage\nloans we service. The\namount and timing of\nreimbursement for\nadvances of delinquent\npayments vary by\ninvestor and the\napplicable servicing\nagreements. See Note 6\n(Mortgage Banking\nActivities) to Financial\nStatements in this\nReport for additional\ninformation about\nresidential and\ncommercial servicing\nrights, servicer\nadvances and servicing\nfees.\n\nIn accordance with\napplicable servicing\nguidelines, upon\ntransfer as servicer, we\nhave the option to\nrepurchase loans from\ncertain loan\nsecuritizations, which\ngenerally becomes\nexercisable based on\ndelinquency status such\nas when three scheduled\nloan payments are past\ndue. When we have the\nunilateral option to\nrepurchase a loan, we\nrecognize the loan and a\ncorresponding liability\non our balance sheet\nregardless of our intent\nto repurchase the loan.\nWe may repurchase these\nloans for cash and as a\nresult, our total\nconsolidated assets do\nnot change.\n\nLoans repurchased from\nGNMA securitization\npools that regain\ncurrent status or are\notherwise modified in\naccordance with\napplicable servicing\nguidelines may be\nincluded in future GNMA\nloan securitization\npools. At September 30,\n2023, and December 31,\n2022, these loans, which\nwe have repurchased or\nhave the unilateral\noption to repurchase,\nwere $8.0 billion and\n$9.8 billion,\nrespectively, which\nincluded $7.6 billion\nand $8.6 billion,\nrespectively, in loans\nheld for investment,\nwith the remainder in\nloans held for sale. See\n\nNote 13 (Securitizations\nand Variable Interest\nEntities) to Financial\nStatements in this\nReport for additional\ninformation about our\ninvolvement with\nmortgage loan\nsecuritizations.\n\nFor additional\ninformation about the\nrisks related to our\nservicing activities,\nsee the \u201cRisk Management\n\u2013 Credit Risk Management\n\u2013 Mortgage Banking\nActivities\u201d section in\nour 2022 Form 10-K.

We are subject\nto interest rate risk\nbecause:\n\n\u2022 assets and liabilities\nmay mature or reprice at\ndifferent times. If\nassets reprice faster\nthan liabilities and\ninterest rates are\ngenerally rising,\nearnings will initially\nincrease or when\ninterest rates are\ngenerally falling,\nearnings will initially\ndecrease;\n\n\u2022 assets and liabilities\nmay reprice at the same\ntime but by different\namounts;\n\n\u2022 short-term and long-\nterm market interest\nrates may change by\ndifferent amounts. For\nexample, the shape of\nthe yield curve may\naffect yield for new\nloans and funding costs\ndifferently;\n\n\u2022 the remaining maturity\nfor various assets or\nliabilities may shorten\nor lengthen as interest\nrates change. For\nexample, if long-term\nmortgage interest rates\nincrease sharply,\nmortgage-related\nproducts may pay down at\na slower rate than\nanticipated, which could\nimpact portfolio income;\nor\n\n\u2022 interest rates may\nhave a direct or\nindirect effect on loan\ndemand, collateral\nvalues, credit losses,\nmortgage origination\nvolume, and the fair\nvalue of MSRs and other\nfinancial instruments.\n\nWe assess interest rate\nrisk by comparing\noutcomes under various\nnet interest income\nsimulations using many\ninterest rate scenarios\nthat differ in the\ndirection of interest\nrate changes, the degree\nof change over time, the\nspeed of change and the\nprojected shape of the\nyield curve. These\nsimulations require\nassumptions regarding\ndrivers of earnings and\nbalance sheet\ncomposition such as loan\noriginations, prepayment\nrates on loans and debt\nsecurities, deposit\nflows and mix, as well\nas pricing strategies.\n\nOur most recent\nsimulations, as\npresented in Table 24,\nestimate net interest\nincome sensitivity over\nthe next 12 months using\ninstantaneous movements\nacross the yield curve\nwith both lower and\nhigher interest rates\nrelative to our base\nscenario. Steeper and\nflatter scenarios\nmeasure non-parallel\nchanges in the yield\ncurve, with long-term\ninterest rates defined\nas all tenors three\nyears and longer and\nshort-term interest\nrates defined as all\ntenors less than three\nyears. Where applicable,\nU.S. dollar interest\nrates are floored at\n0.00%. The following\ndescribes the simulation\nassumptions for the\nscenarios presented in\nTable 24:\n\n\u2022 Simulations are\ndynamic and reflect\nanticipated changes to\nour assets and\nliabilities.\n\n\u2022 Other macroeconomic\nvariables that could be\ncorrelated with the\nchanges in interest\nrates are held constant.\n\n\u2022 Mortgage prepayment\nand origination\nassumptions vary across\nscenarios and reflect\nonly the impact of the\nhigher or lower interest\nrates.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    39  \n                               \nRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement (continued)\n\n\u2022 Our base scenario\ndeposit forecast\nincorporates mix changes\nconsistent with the base\ninterest rate\ntrajectory. Deposit mix\nis modeled to be the\nsame in the base\nscenario and the\nalternative scenarios.\nIn higher interest rate\nscenarios, customer\ndeposit activity that\nshifts balances into\nhigher yielding products\ncould impact expected\nnet interest income. \u2022\nThe interest rate\nsensitivity of deposits\nis modeled using the\nhistorical behavior of\nour deposits portfolio\nand reflects the\nexpectations of deposit\nproducts repricing as\nmarket interest rates\nchange (referred to as\ndeposit betas). Our\nactual experience in\nbase and alternative\nscenarios may differ\nfrom expectations due to\nthe lag or acceleration\nof deposit repricing,\nchanges in consumer\nbehavior, and other\nfactors. \u2022 We hold the\nsize of the projected\ndebt and equity\nsecurities portfolios\nconstant across\nscenarios.

Our interest rate\nsensitivity indicates that we would expect to\nbenefit from higher interest rates as our assets\nwould reprice faster and to a greater degree than\nour liabilities, while in the case of lower\ninterest rates, our assets would reprice downward\nand to a greater degree than our liabilities\nresulting in lower net interest income. The\nmagnitude of the benefit, if any, from higher\ninterest rates may vary from our simulations,\nincluding because future deposit pricing and\nbalances may be different from our current\nexpectations. The sensitivity results above do not\ncapture noninterest income or expense impacts. Our\ninterest rate sensitive noninterest income and\nexpense are impacted by mortgage banking activities\nthat may have sensitivity impacts that move in the\nopposite direction of our net interest income. See\nthe \u201cRisk Management \u2013 Asset/Liability Management \u2013\nMortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk\u201d\nsection in our 2022 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation. Interest rate sensitive noninterest\nincome is also impacted by changes in earnings\ncredit for noninterest-bearing deposits that reduce\ntreasury management deposit-related service fees on\ncommercial accounts, and by trading assets. In\naddition, the impact to net interest income does\nnot include the fair value changes of trading\nsecurities, which, along with the effects of\nrelated economic hedges, are recorded in\nnoninterest income. In addition to changes in\ninterest rates, net interest income and noninterest\nincome from trading securities may be impacted by\nthe actual composition of the trading portfolio.\nFor additional\n\ninformation on our trading assets and liabilities,\nsee Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial\nStatements in this Report. We use the debt\nsecurities portfolio and exchange-traded and over-\nthe-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to\nmanage our interest rate exposures. As interest\nrates increase, changes in the fair value of AFS\ndebt securities may negatively affect accumulated\nother comprehensive income (AOCI), which lowers the\namount of our regulatory capital. AOCI also\nincludes unrealized gains or losses related to the\ntransfer of debt securities from AFS to HTM, which\nare subsequently amortized into earnings over the\nlife of the security with no further impact from\ninterest rate changes. See Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) and Note 3\n(Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt\nSecurities) to Financial Statements in this Report\nfor additional information on the debt securities\nportfolios. We use derivatives for asset/liability\nmanagement in the following main ways: \u2022 to convert\nthe cash flows from selected asset and/or liability\ninstruments/portfolios including certain interest-\nearning deposits, commercial loans and long-term\ndebt, from floating-rate payments to fixed-rate\npayments, or vice versa; \u2022 to reduce AOCI\nsensitivity of our AFS debt securities portfolio;\nand \u2022 to economically hedge our mortgage\norigination pipeline, funded mortgage loans, and\nMSRs. Derivatives used to hedge our interest rate\nrisk exposures are presented in Note 11\n(Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this\nReport. MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET\nRISK We originate and service mortgage loans, which\nsubjects us to various risks, including market,\ninterest rate, credit, and liquidity risks that can\nbe substantial. Based on market conditions and\nother factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks\nby selling or securitizing mortgage loans. We\ndetermine whether mortgage loans will be held for\ninvestment or held for sale at the time of\ncommitment, but may change our intent to hold loans\nfor investment or sale as part of our corporate\nasset/liability management activities. We may also\nretain securities in our investment portfolio at\nthe time we securitize mortgage loans. Changes in\ninterest rates may impact mortgage banking\nnoninterest income, including origination and\nservicing fees, and the fair value of our\nresidential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan\ncommitments (interest rate \u201clocks\u201d) extended to\nmortgage applicants. Interest rate changes will\ngenerally impact our mortgage banking noninterest\nincome on a lagging basis due to the time it takes\nfor the market to reflect a shift in customer\ndemand, as well as the time required for processing\na new application, providing the commitment, and\nsecuritizing and selling the loan. The amount and\ntiming of the impact will depend on the magnitude,\nspeed and duration of the changes in interest\nrates. For additional information on mortgage\nbanking, including key assumptions and the\nsensitivity of the fair value of MSRs, see the\n\u201cRisk Management \u2013 Asset/Liability Management \u2013\nMortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk\u201d\nsection and Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities),\nNote 14 (Derivatives), and Note 15 (Fair Values of\nAssets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in\nour 2022 Form 10-K. MARKET RISK Market risk is the\nrisk of possible economic loss from adverse changes\nin market risk factors such as interest rates,\ncredit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and\ncommodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due\nto\n                               \n  40    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \ncounterparty exposure.\nThis applies to implied\nvolatility risk, basis\nrisk, and market\nliquidity risk. It\nincludes price risk in\nthe trading book,\nmortgage servicing\nrights and the hedge\neffectiveness risk\nassociated with mortgage\nloans held at fair\nvalue, and impairment of\nprivate equity\ninvestments. For\ninformation on our\noversight of market\nrisk, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Market\nRisk\u201d section in our\n2022 Form 10-K.\n\nMARKET RISK \u2013 TRADING\nACTIVITIES We engage in\ntrading activities to\naccommodate the\ninvestment and risk\nmanagement activities of\nour customers and to\nexecute economic hedging\nto manage certain\nbalance sheet risks.\nThese trading activities\npredominantly occur\nwithin our CIB\nbusinesses and, to a\nlesser extent, other\nbusinesses of the\nCompany. Debt securities\nheld for trading, equity\nsecurities held for\ntrading, trading loans,\nand trading derivatives\nare financial\ninstruments used in our\ntrading activities, and\nall are carried at fair\nvalue. Income earned on\nthe financial\ninstruments used in our\ntrading activities\ninclude net interest\nincome, changes in fair\nvalue, and realized\ngains and losses. Net\ninterest income earned\nfrom our trading\nactivities is reflected\nin the interest income\nand interest expense\ncomponents of our\nconsolidated statement\nof income. Changes in\nfair value of the\nfinancial instruments\nused in our trading\n\nactivities are reflected\nin net gains from\ntrading activities. For\nadditional information\non the financial\ninstruments used in our\ntrading activities and\nthe income from these\ntrading activities, see\nNote 2 (Trading\nActivities) to Financial\nStatements in this\nReport.\n\nValue-at-risk (VaR) is a\nstatistical risk measure\nused to estimate the\npotential loss from\nadverse moves in the\nfinancial markets. The\nCompany uses VaR metrics\ncomplemented with\nsensitivity analysis and\nstress testing in\nmeasuring and monitoring\nmarket risk. For\nadditional information\non our monitoring\nactivities, sensitivity\nanalysis and stress\ntesting, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Market Risk\n\u2013 Trading Activities\u201d\nsection in our 2022 Form\n10-K.\n\nTrading VaR is the\nmeasure used to provide\ninsight into the market\nrisk exhibited by the\nCompany\u2019s trading\npositions.

The\ndiversification effect\narises because the risks\nare not perfectly\ncorrelated causing a\nportfolio of positions\nto usually be less risky\nthan the sum of the\nrisks of the positions\nalone. The\ndiversification benefit\nis not meaningful for\nlow and high metrics\nsince they may occur on\ndifferent days.\n\nMARKET RISK \u2013 EQUITY\nSECURITIES We are\ndirectly and indirectly\naffected by changes in\nthe equity markets. We\nmake and manage equity\ninvestments in various\nbusinesses, such as\nstart-up companies and\nemerging growth\ncompanies. We also\ninvest in funds that\nmake similar private\nequity investments. For\nadditional information,\nsee the \u201cRisk Management\n\u2013 Asset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Market Risk\n\u2013 Equity Securities\u201d\nsection in our 2022 Form\n10-K.\n\nAs part of our business\nto support our\ncustomers, we trade\npublic equities,\nlisted/over-the-counter\nequity derivatives, and\nconvertible bonds. We\nhave parameters that\ngovern these activities.\nWe also have marketable\nequity securities that\ninclude investments\nrelating to our venture\ncapital activities. For\nadditional information,\nsee Note 4 (Equity\nSecurities) to Financial\nStatements in this\nReport.\n\nChanges in equity market\nprices may also\nindirectly affect our\nnet income by (1) the\nvalue of third-party\nassets under management\nand, hence, fee income,\n(2) borrowers whose\nability to repay\nprincipal and/or\ninterest may be affected\nby the stock market, or\n(3) brokerage activity,\nrelated commission\nincome and other\nbusiness activities.\nEach business line\nmonitors and manages\nthese indirect risks.\n\nLIQUIDITY RISK AND\nFUNDING Liquidity risk\nis the risk arising from\nthe inability of the\nCompany to meet\nobligations when they\ncome due, or roll over\nfunds at a reasonable\ncost, without incurring\nheightened costs. In the\nordinary course of\nbusiness, we enter into\ncontractual obligations\nthat may require future\ncash payments, including\nfunding for customer\nloan requests, customer\ndeposit maturities and\nwithdrawals, debt\nservice, leases for\npremises and equipment,\nand other cash\ncommitments. Liquidity\nrisk also considers the\nstability of deposits,\nincluding the risk of\nlosing uninsured or non-\noperational deposits.\nThe objective of\neffective liquidity\nmanagement is to ensure\nthat we can meet our\ncontractual obligations\nand other cash\ncommitments efficiently\nunder both normal\noperating conditions and\nunder periods of Wells\nFargo-specific and/or\nmarket stress.\n\nTo help achieve this\nobjective, the Board\nestablishes liquidity\nguidelines that require\nsufficient asset-based\nliquidity to cover\npotential funding\nrequirements and to\navoid over-dependence on\nvolatile, less reliable\nfunding markets. These\nguidelines are monitored\non a monthly basis by\nthe management-level\nCorporate\nAsset/Liability\nCommittee and on a\nquarterly basis by the\nBoard. These guidelines\nare established and\nmonitored for\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    41  \n                               \nRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement (continued)\n\nboth the Company and the\nParent on a stand-alone\nbasis so that the Parent\nis a source of strength\nfor its banking\nsubsidiaries. For\nadditional information\non liquidity risk and\nfunding management, see\nthe \u201cRisk Management \u2013\nLiquidity Risk and\nFunding\u201d section in our\n2022 Form 10-K.\n\nLiquidity Standards We\nare subject to a rule\nissued by the FRB, OCC\nand FDIC that\nestablishes a\nquantitative minimum\nliquidity requirement\nconsistent with the\nliquidity coverage ratio\n(LCR) established by the\nBasel Committee on\nBanking Supervision\n(BCBS). The rule\nrequires a covered\nbanking organization to\nhold high-quality liquid\nassets (HQLA) in an\namount equal to or\ngreater than its\nprojected net cash\noutflows during a 30-day\nstress period. Our HQLA\nunder the rule\npredominantly consists\nof central bank\ndeposits, government\ndebt securities, and\nmortgage-backed\nsecurities of federal\nagencies. The LCR\napplies to the Company\nand to our insured\ndepository institutions\n(IDIs) with total assets\nof $10 billion or more.\nIn addition, rules\nissued by the FRB impose\nenhanced liquidity risk\nmanagement standards on\nlarge bank holding\ncompanies (BHCs), such\nas Wells Fargo.\n\nWe are also subject to a\nrule issued by the FRB,\nOCC and FDIC that\nestablishes a stable\nfunding requirement,\nknown as the net stable\nfunding ratio (NSFR),\nwhich requires a covered\nbanking organization,\nsuch as Wells Fargo, to\nmaintain a minimum\namount of stable\nfunding, including\ncommon equity, long-term\ndebt and most types of\ndeposits, in relation to\nits assets, derivative\nexposures and\ncommitments over a one-\nyear horizon period.

Debt\nsecurities within our\nHTM portfolio are not\nintended for sale but\nmay be pledged to obtain\nfinancing.\n\nAs of September 30,\n2023, we had\napproximately $451.6\nbillion of available\nborrowing capacity at\nvarious Federal Home\nLoan Banks and the\nFederal Reserve Discount\nWindow, based on\ncollateral pledged.\nAlthough available, we\ndo not view this\nborrowing capacity as a\nprimary source of\nliquidity.\n\nIn addition, liquidity\nis also available\nthrough the sale or\nfinancing of other debt\nsecurities, including\ntrading and/or AFS debt\nsecurities, as well as\nthrough the sale,\nsecuritization, or\nfinancing of loans, to\nthe extent such debt\nsecurities and loans are\nnot encumbered.\n\nFunding Sources The\nParent acts as a source\nof funding for the\nCompany through the\nissuance of long-term\ndebt and equity. WFC\nHoldings, LLC (the\n\u201cIHC\u201d) is an\nintermediate holding\ncompany and subsidiary\nof the Parent, which\nprovides funding support\nfor the ongoing\noperational requirements\nof the Parent\n                               \n  42    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nand certain of its\ndirect and indirect\nsubsidiaries.

Deposits were\n144% and 145% of total\nloans at September 30,\n2023, and December 31,\n2022, respectively.\n\nTable 28 presents a\nsummary of our short-\nterm borrowings, which\ngenerally mature in less\nthan 30 days. The\nbalances of\n\nfederal funds purchased\nand securities sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase may vary over\ntime due to client\nactivity, our own demand\nfor financing, and our\noverall mix of\nliabilities.

Our\nobjective is to maintain\ncapital at an amount\ncommensurate with our\nrisk profile and risk\ntolerance objectives,\nand to meet both\nregulatory and market\nexpectations. We\nprimarily fund our\ncapital needs through\nthe retention of\nearnings net of both\ndividends and share\nrepurchases, as well as\nthrough the issuance of\npreferred stock and\nlong- and short-term\ndebt. Retained earnings\nat September 30, 2023,\nincreased $11.3 billion\nfrom December 31, 2022,\npredominantly as a\nresult of $15.7 billion\nof Wells Fargo net\nincome, partially offset\nby $4.4 billion of\ncommon and preferred\nstock dividends. During\nthe first nine months of\n2023, we issued $1.0\nbillion of common stock,\nsubstantially all of\nwhich was issued in\nconnection with employee\ncompensation and\nbenefits. In the first\nnine months of 2023, we\nrepurchased 220 million\nshares of common stock\nat a cost of $9.6\nbillion. For additional\ninformation about\ncapital planning, see\nthe \u201cCapital Planning\nand Stress Testing\u201d\nsection below.\n\nIn July 2023, we issued\n$1.725 billion of our\nPreferred Stock, Series\nEE.

Risk-based\ncapital rules establish\nrisk-adjusted ratios\nrelating regulatory\ncapital to different\ncategories of assets and\noff-balance sheet\nexposures as discussed\nbelow.\n\nRISK-BASED CAPITAL AND\nRISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS The\nCompany is subject to\nrules issued by federal\nbanking regulators to\nimplement Basel III\ncapital requirements for\nU.S. banking\norganizations. The rules\ncontain two frameworks\nfor calculating capital\nrequirements, a\nStandardized Approach\nand an Advanced Approach\napplicable to certain\ninstitutions, including\nWells Fargo, and we must\ncalculate our risk-based\ncapital ratios under\nboth approaches. The\nCompany is required to\nsatisfy the risk-based\ncapital ratio\nrequirements to avoid\nrestrictions on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary bonus\npayments.\n\nOn July 27, 2023,\nfederal banking\nregulators issued a\nproposed rule that would\nimpact the way in which\nrisk-based capital\nrequirements are\ndetermined for certain\nbanks. The proposed rule\nwould eliminate the\ncurrent Advanced\nApproach and replace it\nwith a new expanded\nrisk-based approach for\nthe measurement of risk-\nweighted assets,\nincluding more granular\nrisk weights for credit\nrisk, a new market risk\nframework, and a new\nstandardized approach\nfor measuring\noperational risk. The\nnew requirements would\nbe phased in over a\nthree-year period\nbeginning July 1, 2025.\nThe Company expects a\nsignificant increase in\nits risk-weighted assets\nand a net increase in\nits capital requirements\nbased on an assessment\nof the proposed rule.\nThe Company is\nconsidering a range of\npotential actions to\naddress the impact of\nthe proposed rule,\nincluding balance sheet\nand capital optimization\nstrategies.\n\nTable 31 and Table 32\npresent the risk-based\ncapital requirements\napplicable to the\nCompany under the\nStandardized Approach\nand Advanced Approach,\nrespectively, as of\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n\nTable 31: Risk-Based\nCapital Requirements \u2013\nStandardized Approach\n\nTable 32: Risk-Based\nCapital Requirements \u2013\nAdvanced Approach\n\nIn addition to the risk-\nbased capital\nrequirements described\nin Table 31 and Table\n32, if the FRB\ndetermines that a period\nof excessive credit\ngrowth is contributing\nto an increase in\nsystemic risk, a\ncountercyclical buffer\nof up to 2.50% could be\nadded to the risk-based\ncapital ratio\nrequirements under\nfederal banking\nregulations. The\ncountercyclical buffer\nin effect at September\n30, 2023, was 0.00%.\n\nThe capital conservation\nbuffer is applicable to\ncertain institutions,\nincluding Wells Fargo,\nunder the Advanced\nApproach and is intended\nto absorb losses during\ntimes of economic or\nfinancial stress.\n\nThe stress capital\nbuffer is calculated\nbased on the decrease in\na BHC\u2019s risk-based\ncapital ratios under the\nseverely adverse\nscenario in the FRB\u2019s\nannual supervisory\nstress test and related\nComprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review\n(CCAR), plus four\nquarters of planned\ncommon stock dividends.\nBecause the stress\ncapital buffer is\ncalculated annually\nbased on data that can\ndiffer over time, our\nstress capital buffer,\nand thus our risk-based\ncapital ratio\nrequirements under the\nStandardized Approach,\nare subject to change in\nfuture periods. Our\nstress capital buffer\nfor the period October\n1, 2022, through\nSeptember 30, 2023, was\n3.20%. Our stress\ncapital buffer for the\nperiod October 1, 2023,\nthrough September 30,\n2024, is 2.90%.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    45  \n                               \n                                                   \n  Capital Management(continued)                    \n                                                   \nAs a global systemically\nimportant bank (G-SIB),\nwe are also subject to\nthe FRB\u2019s rule\nimplementing an\nadditional capital\nsurcharge between\n1.00-4.50% on the risk-\nbased capital ratio\nrequirements of G-SIBs.\nUnder the rule, we must\nannually calculate our\nsurcharge under two\nmethods and use the\nhigher\n\nof the two surcharges.\nThe first method (method\none) considers our size,\ninterconnectedness,\ncross-jurisdictional\nactivity,\nsubstitutability, and\ncomplexity, consistent\nwith the methodology\ndeveloped by the BCBS\nand the Financial\nStability Board (FSB).\nThe second method\n(method two) uses\nsimilar inputs, but\nreplaces\nsubstitutability with\nuse of short-term\nwholesale funding and\nwill generally result in\nhigher surcharges than\nunder method one.\nBecause the G-SIB\ncapital surcharge is\ncalculated annually\nbased on data that can\ndiffer over time, the\namount of the surcharge\nis subject to change in\nfuture years. If our\nannual calculation\nresults in a decrease to\nour G-SIB capital\nsurcharge, the decrease\ntakes effect the next\ncalendar year. If our\nannual calculation\nresults in an increase\nto our G-SIB capital\n\nsurcharge, the increase\ntakes effect in two\ncalendar years. Our\nG-SIB capital surcharge\nwill continue to be\n1.50% in 2023. On July\n27, 2023, the FRB issued\na proposed rule that\nwould impact the\nmethodology used to\ncalculate the G-SIB\ncapital surcharge.\n\nUnder the risk-based\ncapital rules, on-\nbalance sheet assets and\ncredit equivalent\namounts of derivatives\nand off-balance sheet\nitems are assigned to\none of several broad\nrisk categories\naccording to the\nobligor, or, if\nrelevant, the guarantor\nor the nature of any\ncollateral. The\naggregate dollar amount\nin each risk category is\nthen multiplied by the\nrisk weight associated\nwith that category. The\nresulting weighted\nvalues from each of the\nrisk categories are\naggregated for\ndetermining total risk-\nweighted assets (RWAs).\n\nThe tables that follow\nprovide information\nabout our risk-based\ncapital and related\nratios as calculated\nunder Basel III capital\nrules.

We adopted this\nASU with retrospective\napplication, which\nrequired revision of\nprior period financial\nstatements. Prior period\nrisk-based capital and\ncertain other regulatory\nrelated metrics were not\nrevised. For additional\ninformation, see Note 1\n(Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) to\nFinancial Statements in\nthis Report.\n\n(2) In third quarter\n2023, we sold\ninvestments in certain\nprivate equity funds.

The rule\npermits certain banking\norganizations to exclude\nfrom regulatory capital\nthe initial adoption\nimpact of CECL, plus 25%\nof the cumulative\nchanges in the allowance\nfor credit losses (ACL)\nunder CECL for each\nperiod until December\n31, 2021, followed by a\nthree-year phase-out\nperiod in which the\nbenefit is reduced by\n25% in year one, 50% in\nyear two and 75% in year\nthree.\n\n(5) Differences between\nthe approaches are\ndriven by the qualifying\namounts of ACL\nincludable in Tier 2\ncapital. Under the\nAdvanced Approach,\neligible credit reserves\nrepresented by the\namount of qualifying ACL\nin excess of expected\ncredit losses (using\nregulatory definitions)\nis limited to 0.60% of\nAdvanced credit RWAs,\nwhereas the Standardized\nApproach includes ACL in\nTier 2 capital up to\n1.25% of Standardized\ncredit RWAs.

The\nmethodology of\ndetermining tangible\ncommon equity may differ\namong companies.\nManagement believes that\ntangible book value per\ncommon share and return\non average tangible\ncommon equity, which\nutilize tangible common\nequity, are useful\nfinancial measures\nbecause they enable\nmanagement, investors,\nand others to assess the\nCompany\u2019s use of equity.\n\nTable 38 provides a\nreconciliation of these\nnon-GAAP financial\nmeasures to GAAP\nfinancial measures.\n                                                   \n  Table 38:                                        \n                                                   \n                                                   \n  Tangible Common Equity                           \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n(1) In fourth quarter\n2022, we redeemed all\noutstanding shares of\nour Employee Stock\nOwnership Plan (ESOP)\nCumulative Convertible\nPreferred Stock in\nexchange for shares of\nthe Company's common\nstock.

As\nof September 30, 2023,\nthese broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries were in\ncompliance with their\nrespective regulatory\nminimum net capital\nrequirements. Capital\nPlanning and Stress\nTesting Our planned\nlong-term capital\nstructure is designed to\nmeet regulatory and\nmarket expectations. We\nbelieve that our long-\nterm targeted capital\nstructure enables us to\ninvest in and grow our\nbusiness, satisfy our\ncustomers\u2019 financial\nneeds in varying\nenvironments, access\nmarkets, and maintain\nflexibility to return\ncapital to our\nshareholders. Our long-\nterm targeted capital\nstructure also considers\ncapital levels\nsufficient to exceed\ncapital requirements,\nincluding the G-SIB\ncapital surcharge and\nthe stress capital\nbuffer, as well as\npotential changes to\nregulatory requirements\nfor our capital ratios,\nplanned capital actions,\nchanges in our risk\nprofile and other\nfactors. Accordingly,\nour long-term target\ncapital levels are set\nabove their respective\nregulatory minimums plus\nbuffers. The FRB capital\nplan rule establishes\ncapital planning and\nother requirements that\ngovern capital\ndistributions, including\ndividends and share\nrepurchases, by certain\nBHCs, including Wells\nFargo. The FRB assesses,\namong other things, the\noverall financial\ncondition, risk profile,\nand capital adequacy of\nBHCs when evaluating\ntheir capital plans. As\npart of the annual\nComprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review, the\nFRB generates a\nsupervisory stress test.\nThe FRB reviews the\nsupervisory stress test\nresults as required\nunder the Dodd-Frank Act\nusing a common set of\ncapital actions for all\nlarge BHCs and also\nreviews the Company\u2019s\nproposed capital\nactions. Federal banking\nregulators also require\nlarge BHCs and banks to\nconduct their own stress\ntests to evaluate\nwhether the institution\nhas sufficient capital\nto continue to operate\nduring periods of\nadverse economic and\nfinancial conditions.\n                               \n  50    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \n                                                   \n  Securities Repurchases                           \n                                                   \nFrom time to time the\nBoard authorizes the\nCompany to repurchase\nshares of our common\nstock. Although we\nannounce when the Board\nauthorizes share\nrepurchases, we\ntypically do not give\nany public notice before\nwe repurchase our\nshares. Various factors\ndetermine the amount of\nour share repurchases,\nincluding our capital\nrequirements, the number\nof shares we expect to\nissue for employee\nbenefit plans and any\nacquisitions, market\nconditions (including\nthe trading price of our\nstock), and regulatory\nand legal\nconsiderations,\nincluding under the\nFRB\u2019s\n\ncapital plan rule. Due\nto the various factors\nthat may impact the\namount of our share\nrepurchases and the fact\nthat we tend to be in\nthe market regularly to\nsatisfy repurchase\nconsiderations under our\ncapital plan, our share\nrepurchases occur at\nvarious price levels. We\nmay suspend share\nrepurchase activity at\nany time.\n\nAt September 30, 2023,\nwe had remaining Board\nauthority to repurchase\nup to approximately $29\nbillion of common stock,\nsubject to regulatory\nand legal conditions.\n\nFor additional\ninformation about share\nrepurchases during third\nquarter 2023, see Part\nII, Item 2 in this\nReport.\n                      \n  Regulatory Matters  \n                      \nThe U.S. financial\nservices industry is\nsubject to significant\nregulation and\nregulatory oversight\ninitiatives.

To prepare the financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP, management must make\nestimates based on assumptions about future\neconomic and market conditions (for example,\nunemployment, market liquidity, real estate prices,\netc.) that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements, income and expenses during the\nreporting period and the related disclosures.\nAlthough our estimates contemplate current\nconditions and how we expect them to change in the\nfuture, it is reasonably possible that actual\nconditions could be worse than anticipated in those\nestimates, which could materially affect our\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nManagement has made significant estimates in\nseveral areas, including: \u2022 allowance for credit\nlosses (Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses)); \u2022 valuations of residential\nmortgage servicing rights (MSRs) (Note 6 (Mortgage\nBanking Activities) and Note 13 (Securitizations\nand Variable Interest Entities)); \u2022 valuations of\nfinancial instruments (Note 12 (Fair Values of\nAssets and Liabilities)); \u2022 liabilities for\ncontingent litigation losses (Note 10 (Legal\nActions)); \u2022 income taxes; and \u2022 goodwill\nimpairment (Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other\nAssets)). Actual results could differ from those\nestimates. These unaudited interim financial\nstatements reflect all adjustments that are, in the\nopinion of management, necessary for a fair\nstatement of the results for the periods presented.\nThese adjustments are of a normal recurring nature,\nunless otherwise disclosed in this Form 10-Q. The\nresults of operations in the interim financial\nstatements do not necessarily indicate the results\nthat may be expected for the full year. The interim\nfinancial information should be read in conjunction\nwith our 2022 Form 10-K. Accounting Standards\nAdopted in 2023 In 2023, we adopted the following\nnew accounting guidance: \u2022 Accounting Standards\nUpdate (ASU) 2022-02, Financial Instruments \u2013\nCredit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures \u2022 ASU\n2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair\nValue Hedging \u2013 Portfolio Layer Method \u2022 ASU\n2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805):\nAccounting for Contract Assets and Contract\nLiabilities from Contracts with Customers \u2022 ASU\n2018-12, Financial Services \u2013 Insurance (Topic\n944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for\nLong-Duration Contracts and subsequent related\nupdates ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting and\nreporting for troubled debt restructurings (TDRs)\nby creditors and introduces new required\ndisclosures for loan modifications made to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The\nnew required disclosures include information about\nmodifications granted to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty in the form of principal\nforgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-\ninsignificant payment delays, term extensions, or a\ncombination of these modifications. The ASU also\nrequires new disclosures for the financial effects\nof these modifications and for loan performance in\nthe twelve months following the modification. The\nUpdate also amends the guidance for vintage\ndisclosures to require disclosure of current period\ngross charge-offs by year of origination. See Note\n5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses)\nfor additional information related to the new\ndisclosures for loan modifications to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty and for gross\ncharge-offs by year of origination, which are\nprovided on a prospective basis. The Update\neliminates the requirement to use a discounted cash\nflow (DCF) approach to measure the allowance for\ncredit losses (ACL) for TDRs and instead allows for\nthe use of a current expected credit loss approach\nfor all loans. Under a current expected credit loss\napproach, the impact of loan modifications and the\nsubsequent performance of modified loans, including\ndefaults, is reflected in the historical loss data\nused to calculate expected lifetime credit losses.\nUpon adoption on January 1, 2023, we discontinued\nutilizing a DCF approach to measure credit\nimpairment for consumer loans and certain\ncommercial loans previously modified in a TDR and\nwe removed the interest concession component\nrecognized in the ACL. We elected to apply the\nmodified-retrospective transition approach method,\nresulting in a cumulative effect adjustment to\nretained earnings upon adoption, which reflects the\ndifference between the pre-modification and post-\nmodification effective interest rates that would\nhave been recognized over the remaining life of the\nloans as interest income. Upon adoption, we\nrecognized a decrease in our ACL of $ 429million,\npre-tax, and an increase to our retained earnings\nof $ 323million, after tax. We continue to use a\nDCF approach for certain non-accruing, non-\ncollateral dependent commercial loans.\n                               \n  64    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nASU 2022-01 establishes the portfolio layer method,\nwhich expands an entity's ability to achieve fair\nvalue hedge accounting for interest rate risk\nhedges of closed portfolios of financial assets.\nThe Update also provides guidance on the accounting\nfor hedged item basis adjustments under the\nportfolio layer method. We adopted ASU 2022-01 on\nJanuary 1, 2023 on a prospective basis. No\ncumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance\nof stockholders\u2019 equity was required upon adoption,\nas impacts to us were reflected prospectively. The\nportfolio layer method improves our ability to use\nderivatives to hedge interest rate risk exposures\nassociated with portfolios of financial assets,\nsuch as fixed-rate available-for-sale (AFS) debt\nsecurities and loans. The Update allows us to hedge\na larger proportion of these portfolios by\nexpanding the number and type of derivatives\npermitted as eligible hedges, as well as by\nincreasing the scope of eligible hedged items to\ninclude both prepayable and nonprepayable assets.\nUnlike other fair value hedging relationships where\nbasis adjustments adjust the carrying amount of the\nindividual hedged item, basis adjustments related\nto active portfolio layer method hedges are\nmaintained at a portfolio level and not allocated\nto the individual assets in the portfolio. Upon\nadoption, any election to designate portfolio layer\nmethod hedges is applied prospectively.\nAdditionally, the Update permits a one-time\nreclassification of debt securities from held-to-\nmaturity (HTM) to AFS classification as long as the\nsecurities are designated in a portfolio layer\nmethod hedge no later than 30 days after the\nadoption date. In January 2023, we reclassified\nfixed-rate debt securities with an aggregate fair\nvalue of $ 23.2billion and amortized cost of $\n23.9billion from HTM to AFS and designated interest\nrate swaps with notional amounts of $ 20.1billion\nas fair value hedges using the portfolio layer\nmethod. The transfer of debt securities was\nrecorded at fair value and resulted in\napproximately $ 566million of unrealized losses\nassociated with AFS debt securities being recorded\nto other comprehensive income, net of deferred\ntaxes. See Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\nMaturity Debt Securities) for additional\ninformation about the Company's portfolio layer\nmethod hedge basis adjustments and HTM to AFS\ntransfers in connection with adoption of the Update\nand Note 11 (Derivatives) for disclosures regarding\nour portfolio layer method hedging relationships.\nASU 2021-08 amends Accounting Standards\nCodification (ASC) 805 \u2013 Business Combinations to\nrequire entities to recognize and measure contract\nassets and contract liabilities in a business\ncombination in accordance with ASC 606 \u2013 Revenue\nRecognition. Prior to ASU 2021-08, there was\ndiversity in practice related to recognition\ntreatment, and acquirers generally measured such\nitems at acquisition date fair value. We adopted\nthis Update prospectively on January 1, 2023. This\nUpdate did not have a material impact to our\nconsolidated financial statements. ASU 2018-12\nchanges the accounting for long-duration insurance\ncontracts or contract features that provide\nbenefits to the policyholder in addition to the\npolicyholder\u2019s account value. These features, which\nthe ASU defines as market risk benefits, protect\nthe policyholder to some degree from capital\nmarkets risk and expose the insurer or reinsurer to\nthat risk. The ASU requires all market risk\nbenefits to be measured at fair value through\nearnings with changes in fair value attributable to\nour own credit risk recognized in other\ncomprehensive income. We reinsure certain variable\nannuity products for a limited number of insurance\nclients with guaranteed minimum benefits which are\naccounted for as market risk benefits under the\nASU. Our reinsurance business is no longer entering\ninto new contracts. We utilize a discounted cash\nflow model to value our market risk benefits.\nMarket risk benefits are level 3 fair value\nliabilities because they are valued using\nsignificant unobservable inputs. The fair value of\nour market risk benefits is sensitive to changes in\nfixed income and equity markets, as well as\npolicyholder behavior (e.g., withdrawals, lapses,\nutilization rate) and changes in mortality\nassumptions. Beginning first quarter 2023, we use\nderivative instruments, where feasible, to\neconomically hedge the interest rate and equity\nmarkets volatility. The fair value of market risk\nbenefits is measured at the contract level and is\nrecognized in accrued expenses and other\nliabilities. We recognize changes in fair value for\nour market risk benefits, excluding the change in\nfair value related to our own credit risk, in\nnoninterest income along with the changes in fair\nvalue of economic hedges. Changes in fair value\nattributable to our own credit risk are recorded in\nother comprehensive income. Upon adoption on\nJanuary 1, 2023, as required under the ASU, we\nimplemented the accounting changes for market risk\nbenefits retrospectively, to the earliest period\npresented, which resulted in an after-tax\ncumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained\nearnings and accumulated other comprehensive income\nby $ 176million and $ 44million, respectively, as\nof January 1, 2022. The ASU also requires more\nfrequent updates for insurance assumptions,\nmandates the use of a standardized discount rate\nfor traditional long-duration contracts, and\nsimplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition\ncosts. The accounting changes for the liability of\nfuture policyholder benefits for traditional long-\nduration contracts (included in accrued expenses\nand other liabilities) and deferred acquisition\ncosts (included in other assets) did not have a\nmaterial impact upon adoption. Table 1.1 presents\nthe impact of adoption to prior period financial\nstatement line items within our consolidated\nstatement of income and consolidated balance sheet\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2022, and as of December 31, 2022. These\nadjustments are also reflected in our consolidated\nstatement of changes in equity and consolidated\nstatement of cash flows.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    65  \n

The\ncredit quality indicators that we most closely\nmonitor include credit ratings and delinquency\nstatus and are based on information as of our\nfinancial statement date. CREDIT RATINGS Credit\nratings express opinions about the credit quality\nof a debt security. We determine the credit rating\nof a security according to the lowest credit rating\nmade available by national recognized statistical\nrating organizations (NRSROs). Debt securities\nrated investment grade, that is those with ratings\nsimilar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as defined by\nNRSROs, are generally considered by the rating\nagencies and market participants to be low credit\nrisk. Conversely, debt securities rated below\ninvestment grade, labeled as \u201cspeculative grade\u201d by\nthe rating agencies, are considered to be\ndistinctively higher credit risk than investment\ngrade debt securities. For debt securities not\nrated by NRSROs, we determine an internal credit\ngrade of the debt securities (used for credit risk\nmanagement purposes) equivalent to the credit\nratings assigned by major credit agencies.\nSubstantially all of our debt securities were rated\nby NRSROs at September 30, 2023, and December 31,\n2022. Table 3.4 shows the percentage of fair value\nof AFS debt securities and amortized cost of HTM\ndebt securities determined to be rated investment\ngrade, inclusive of securities rated based

of recognition\nof credit losses. As such, as part of our\nmonitoring of the credit quality of the debt\nsecurity portfolio, we consider whether debt\nsecurities we own are past due in payment of\nprincipal or interest payments and whether any\nsecurities have been placed into nonaccrual status.\nDebt securities that are past due and still\naccruing or in nonaccrual status were insignificant\nat both September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022.\nNet charge-offs on debt securities were\ninsignificant in the third quarter and first nine\nmonths of both 2023 and 2022. Purchased debt\nsecurities with credit deterioration (PCD) are not\nconsidered to be in nonaccrual status, as payments\nfrom issuers of these securities remain current.\nPCD securities were insignificant in the third\nquarter and first nine months of both 2023 and\n2022. Unrealized Losses of Available-for-Sale Debt\nSecurities Table 3.5 shows the gross unrealized\nlosses and fair value of AFS debt securities by\nlength of time those individual securities in each\ncategory have been in a continuous loss position.\nDebt securities on which we have recorded credit\nimpairment are categorized as being \u201cless than 12\nmonths\u201d or \u201c12 months or more\u201d in a continuous loss\nposition based on the point in time that the fair\nvalue declined to below the amortized cost basis,\nnet of allowance for credit losses.\n\nTable 3.5: Gross Unrealized Losses and Fair Value \u2013\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities\n                                                   \n                 \u2026               12                \n                 \u2026               m\u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       or    \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       m\u2026    \u2026        \u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       F\u2026    \u2026        \u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       v\u2026    \u2026        \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                   \n      $  \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    4\u2026     \n         \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    1\u2026     \n         \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    5\u2026     \n         \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    2\u2026     \n         \u2014    \u2014       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    1\u2026     \n         \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    5\u2026     \n      $  \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    1\u2026     \n                                                   \n                                                   \n      $  \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    3\u2026     \n         \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    4\u2026     \n         \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    4\u2026     \n         \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    3\u2026     \n         \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    3\u2026     \n         \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    2\u2026     \n      $  \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    9\u2026     \n                                                   \n(1) Excludes portfolio level basis adjustments.\n                               \n  70    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nWe have assessed each debt security with gross\nunrealized losses included in the previous table\nfor credit impairment. As part of that assessment\nwe evaluated and concluded that we do not intend to\nsell any of the debt securities, and that it is\nmore likely than not that we will not be required\nto sell, prior to recovery of the amortized cost\nbasis. We evaluate, where necessary, whether credit\nimpairment exists by comparing the present value of\nthe expected cash flows to the debt securities\u2019\namortized cost basis. Credit impairment is recorded\nas an ACL for debt securities. For descriptions of\nthe factors we consider when analyzing debt\nsecurities for impairment as well as methodology\nand significant inputs used to measure credit\nlosses, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) in our 2022 Form 10-K.\nContractual Maturities Table 3.6 and Table 3.7 show\nthe remaining contractual maturities, amortized\ncost, net of the ACL, fair value and weighted\naverage effective yields of AFS and HTM debt\nsecurities, respectively. The remaining contractual\nprincipal maturities for mortgage-backed securities\n(MBS) do not consider prepayments. Remaining\nexpected maturities will differ from contractual\nmaturities because borrowers may have the right to\nprepay obligations before the underlying mortgages\nmature.\n\nTable 3.6: Contractual

We also\noriginate multipurpose\nlending commitments\nunder which commercial\ncustomers have the\noption to draw on the\nfacility in one of\nseveral forms, including\nthe issuance of letters\nof credit, which reduces\nthe unfunded commitment\namounts of the facility.\nThe maximum credit risk\nfor these commitments\nwill generally be lower\nthan the contractual\namount because these\ncommitments may expire\nwithout being used or\nmay be cancelled at the\ncustomer\u2019s request. We\nmay reduce or cancel\nlines of credit in\naccordance with the\ncontracts and applicable\nlaw. Our credit risk\nmonitoring activities\ninclude managing the\namount of commitments,\nboth to individual\ncustomers and in total,\nand the size and\nmaturity structure of\nthese commitments. We do\nnot recognize an ACL for\ncommitments that are\nunconditionally\ncancellable at our\ndiscretion.

Any advances\nare generally repaid in\nless than a week and\nwould normally require\ndefault of both the\ncustomer and another\nlender to expose us to\nloss.\nThe contractual amount\nof our unfunded credit\ncommitments, including\nunissued letters of\ncredit, is summarized in\nTable 5.4.

Loan delinquency, Fair Isaac\nCorporation (FICO) credit scores and loan-to-value\n(LTV) for residential mortgage loans are the\nprimary credit quality indicators that we monitor\nand utilize in our evaluation of the\nappropriateness of the ACL for the consumer loan\nportfolio segment. Gross charge-offs by loan class\nare included in the following tables for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, which we monitor\nas part of our credit risk management practices;\nhowever, charge-offs are not a primary credit\nquality indicator for our loan portfolio. Many of\nour loss estimation techniques used for the ACL for\nloans rely on delinquency-based models; therefore,\ndelinquency is an important indicator of credit\nquality in the establishment of our ACL for\nconsumer loans. Credit quality information is\nprovided with the year of origination for term\nloans. Revolving loans may convert to term loans as\na result of a contractual provision in the original\nloan agreement or if modified for a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty. We obtain FICO\nscores at loan origination and the scores are\ngenerally updated at least quarterly, except in\nlimited circumstances, including compliance with\nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). FICO scores\nare not available for certain loan types or may not\nbe required if we deem it unnecessary due to strong\ncollateral and other borrower attributes. Table 5.9\nprovides the outstanding balances of our\nresidential mortgage loans by our primary credit\nquality indicators. LTV refers to the ratio\ncomparing the loan\u2019s outstanding balance to the\nproperty\u2019s collateral value. Combined LTV (CLTV)\nrefers to the combination of first lien mortgage\nand junior lien mortgage (including unused line\namounts for credit line products) ratios. We obtain\nLTVs and CLTVs using a cascade approach which first\nuses values provided by automated valuation models\n(AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not\navailable, then the value is estimated using the\noriginal appraised value adjusted by the change in\nHome Price Index (HPI) for the property location.\nIf an HPI is not available, the original appraised\nvalue is used. The HPI value is normally the only\nmethod considered for high value properties,\ngenerally with an original value of $ 1million or\nmore, as the AVM values have proven less accurate\nfor these properties. Generally, we obtain\navailable LTVs and CLTVs on a quarterly basis.\nCertain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV due to a\nlack of industry data availability and portfolios\nacquired from or serviced by other institutions.\n                               \n  80    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 5.9: Credit Quality Indicators for\nResidential Mortgage Loans by Vintage\n                                                   \n                                                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n(1) Government insured or guaranteed loans\nrepresent loans whose repayments are predominantly\ninsured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA)\nor guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs\n(VA).

Our commercial\nloan modifications may include principal\nforgiveness, interest rate reductions, payment\ndelays, term extensions, or a combination of these\nmodifications. Commercial loan term extensions have\nterms that vary based on the borrower\u2019s request and\nare evaluated by our credit teams on an individual\nbasis. Our consumer loan modifications vary based\nupon the loan product and the modification program\noffered to the borrower, and may include interest\nrate reductions, payment delays, term extensions,\nprincipal forbearance or forgiveness, or a\ncombination of these modifications. Generally, our\nconsumer loan modification programs modify the loan\nterms to achieve payment terms that are more\naffordable to the borrower and, as a result,\nincrease the likelihood of full repayment of\nprincipal and interest. Our residential mortgage\nloan modification programs may offer a short-term\npayment deferral based upon the borrower's\ndemonstrated hardship, up to 12 months. If\nadditional assistance is needed after 12 months,\nthe borrower may request another loan modification.\nModifications may also include a trial payment\nperiod of three months to determine if the borrower\ncan perform in accordance with the proposed\npermanent loan modification terms. Loans in a trial\npayment period continue to advance through\ndelinquency status and accrue interest according to\ntheir original terms. Loans in a trial payment\nperiod are excluded from our loan modification\ndisclosures until the borrower has successfully\ncompleted the trial period and the loan\nmodification is formally executed. Residential\nmortgage loans in a trial payment period totaled $\n115million at September 30, 2023. Credit card loan\nmodifications result in a reduction in the credit\ncard interest rate and may be offered on a short-\nterm or long-term basis. A short-term interest rate\nreduction program reduces the borrower\u2019s interest\nrate for 12 months. A long-term interest rate\nreduction program provides a reduction of the\ninterest rate over a fixed five-year term. During\nthe modification period, the borrower\u2019s revolving\ncharge privileges are revoked. Auto loan\nmodifications generally include insignificant\n(e.g., three months or less) payment deferrals over\nthe loan term. The following disclosures provide\ninformation on loan modifications granted to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the\nform of principal forgiveness, interest rate\nreductions, other-than-insignificant (e.g., greater\nthan three months) payment delays, term extensions\nor a combination of these modifications, as well as\nthe financial effects of these modifications, and\nloan performance in the twelve months following the\nmodification. Loans that both modify and are paid\noff or charged-off during the period, resulting in\nan amortized cost balance of zero at the end of the\nperiod, are not included in the disclosures below.\nAdditionally, where amortized cost balances are\npresented below, accrued interest receivable is\nexcluded. See Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other\nAssets) for additional information on accrued\ninterest receivable.

The table also\nincludes the amount of gross charge-offs that\noccurred during the third quarter and first nine\nmonths of 2023, inclusive of charge-offs to loans\nwith no amortized cost remaining at period end.\n\nTable 5.16b: Payment Performance of Consumer Loan\nModifications\n                                                   \n            \u2026                                      \n            \u2026                                      \n            \u2026                                      \n            \u2026       \u2026                              \n            \u2026       \u2026                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026      1      7    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026       2       \u2014      \u2026      1      1    \n         \u2026       3       1      \u2026      1      2    \n      $  \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n(1) Includes loans that\nwere past due prior to\nentering a payment delay\nmodification.\nDelinquency advancement\nis paused during the\ndeferral period and\nresumes upon exit.\n\n(2) Credit card loans\nthat are past due at the\ntime of the modification\ndo not become current\nuntil they have three\nmonths of consecutive\npayment performance.\n\nCommitments to lend\nadditional funds on\ncommercial loans that\nwere modified during the\nnine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, were\n$ 167million,\nsubstantially all of\nwhich were in the\ncommercial and\nindustrial portfolio.\nCommitments to lend\nadditional funds on\nconsumer loans that were\nmodified during the nine\nmonths ended September\n30, 2023, were\ninsignificant.\n\nTROUBLED DEBT\nRESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs) In\nJanuary 2023, we adopted\nASU 2022-02, which\neliminated the\naccounting and reporting\nguidance for TDRs.

The reported amounts include loans\nthat are new TDRs that may have COVID-19-related\npayment deferrals and exclude COVID-19-related\npayment deferrals on loans previously reported as\nTDRs given limited current financial effects other\nthan payment deferral.\n\n(3) Charge-offs include write-downs of the\ninvestment in the loan in the period it is\ncontractually modified. The amount of charge-off\nwill differ from the modification terms if the loan\nhas been charged down prior to the modification\nbased on our policies. In addition, there may be\ncases where we have a charge-off/down with no legal\nprincipal modification.\n\n(4) Recorded investment related to interest rate\nreduction reflects the effect of reduced interest\nrates on loans with an interest rate concession as\none of their concession types, which includes loans\nreported as a principal primary modification type\nthat also have an interest rate concession.\n\n(5) Trial modifications are granted a delay in\npayments due under the original terms during the\ntrial payment period. However, these loans continue\nto advance through delinquency status and accrue\ninterest according to their original terms. Any\nsubsequent permanent modification generally\nincludes interest rate related concessions;\nhowever, the exact concession type and resulting\nfinancial effect are usually not known until the\nloan is permanently modified.

Prepayment speeds are influenced\nby mortgage interest rates as well as our\nestimation of drivers of borrower behavior.\nThe sensitivities in the preceding table are\nhypothetical and caution should be exercised when\nrelying on this data. Changes in value based on\nvariations in assumptions generally cannot be\nextrapolated because the relationship of the change\nin the assumption to the change in value may not be\nlinear. Also, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the value of the other\ninterests held is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumptions. In reality, changes\nin one factor may result in changes in others,\nwhich might magnify or counteract the\nsensitivities.\n                               \n  90    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nWe present the components of our managed servicing\nportfolio in Table 6.3 at unpaid principal balance\nfor loans serviced and subserviced for others and\nat carrying value for owned loans serviced.\nTable 6.3: Managed Servicing Portfolio\n                                                   \n  (in                  Sep 30,            Dec 31,  \n  billio\u2026              2023               2022     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Reside\u2026                                          \n  mortga\u2026                                          \n  servic\u2026                                          \n  Servic\u2026                                          \n  and                                              \n  subser\u2026    $    592                681           \n  for                                              \n  others                                           \n  Owned                                            \n  loans           265                273           \n  servic\u2026                                          \n  Total                                            \n  reside\u2026         857                954           \n  servic\u2026                                          \n  Commer\u2026                                          \n  mortga\u2026                                          \n  servic\u2026                                          \n  Servic\u2026                                          \n  and                                              \n  subser\u2026         554                577           \n  for                                              \n  others                                           \n  Owned                                            \n  loans           129                133           \n  servic\u2026                                          \n  Total                                            \n  commer\u2026         683                710           \n  servic\u2026                                          \n  Total                                            \n  managed    $  1,540              1,664           \n  servic\u2026                                          \n  portfo\u2026                                          \n  Total                                            \n  servic\u2026                                          \n  for                                              \n  others,    $  1,136              1,246           \n  exclud\u2026                                          \n  subser\u2026                                          \n  for                                              \n  others                                           \n  MSRs as                                          \n  a                                                \n  percen\u2026                                          \n  of             0.84  %            0.84           \n  loans                                            \n  servic\u2026                                          \n  for                                              \n  others                                           \n  Weight\u2026                                          \n  average                                          \n  note                                             \n  rate                                             \n  (mortg\u2026        4.47               4.30           \n  loans                                            \n  servic\u2026                                          \n  for                                              \n  others)                                          \n                                                   \nAt September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we\nhad servicer advances, net of an allowance for\nuncollectible amounts, of $ 1.9billion and $\n2.5billion, respectively.

The credit risk related to\nthese advances is limited since the reimbursement\nis generally senior to cash payments to investors.\nWe also advance payments of taxes and insurance for\nour owned loans which are collectible from the\nborrower. We maintain an allowance for\nuncollectible amounts for advances on loans\nserviced for others that may not be reimbursed if\nthe payments were not made in accordance with\napplicable servicing agreements or if the insurance\nor servicing agreements contain limitations on\nreimbursements. Servicing advances on owned loans\nare written-off when deemed uncollectible.

These proceedings and investigations\ninclude actions brought against Wells Fargo and/or\nour subsidiaries with respect to corporate-related\nmatters and transactions in which Wells Fargo\nand/or our subsidiaries were involved. In addition,\nWells Fargo and our subsidiaries may be requested\nto provide information to or otherwise cooperate\nwith government authorities in the conduct of\ninvestigations of other persons or industry groups.\nWe establish accruals for legal actions when\npotential losses associated with the actions become\nprobable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.\nFor such accruals, we record the amount we consider\nto be the best estimate within a range of potential\nlosses that are both probable and estimable;\nhowever, if we cannot determine a best estimate,\nthen we record the low end of the range of those\npotential losses. There can be no assurance as to\nthe ultimate outcome of legal actions, including\nthe matters described below, and the actual costs\nof resolving legal actions may be substantially\nhigher or lower than the amounts accrued for those\nactions. ADVISORY ACCOUNT CASH SWEEP INVESTIGATION\nThe United States Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) has undertaken an investigation\nregarding the cash sweep options that the Company\nprovides to investment advisory clients at account\nopening. AUTOMOBILE LENDING MATTERS On April 20,\n2018, the Company entered into consent orders with\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)\nand the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)\nto resolve, among other things, investigations by\nthe agencies into the Company\u2019s compliance risk\nmanagement program and its past practices involving\ncertain automobile collateral protection insurance\n(CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest rate\nlock extensions. Shareholders filed a putative\nsecurities fraud class action against the Company\nand its executive officers alleging material\nmisstatements and omissions of CPI-related\ninformation in the Company\u2019s public disclosures. In\nJanuary 2020, the court dismissed this action as to\nall defendants except the Company and a former\nexecutive officer and limited the action to two\nalleged misstatements. On September 26, 2023, the\ncourt granted final approval of an agreement\npursuant to which the Company paid $ 300million to\nresolve this action. Additionally, a number of\nother lawsuits were filed by non-governmental\nparties seeking damages or other remedies related\nto these CPI policies and related to the unused\nportion of guaranteed automobile protection (GAP)\nwaiver or insurance agreements. As previously\ndisclosed, the Company entered into various\nsettlements to resolve these lawsuits, while others\nwere dismissed. In addition, federal and state\ngovernment agencies, including the CFPB, have\nundertaken formal or informal inquiries,\ninvestigations, or examinations regarding these and\nother issues related to the origination, servicing,\nand collection of consumer auto loans, including\nrelated insurance products. On December 20, 2022,\nthe Company entered into a consent order with the\nCFPB to resolve the CFPB\u2019s investigations related\nto automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts,\nand mortgage lending. The consent order requires,\namong other things, remediation to customers and\nthe payment of a $ 1.7billion civil penalty to the\nCFPB. As previously disclosed, the Company entered\ninto an agreement to resolve investigations by\nstate attorneys general. COMPANY 401(K) PLAN\nMATTERS Federal government agencies, including the\nUnited States Department of Labor (Department of\nLabor), have undertaken reviews of certain\ntransactions associated with the Employee Stock\nOwnership Plan feature of the Company\u2019s 401(k)\nplan, including the manner in which the 401(k) plan\npurchased certain securities used in connection\nwith the Company\u2019s contributions to the 401(k)\nplan. As previously disclosed, the Company entered\ninto an agreement to resolve the Department of\nLabor\u2019s review. On September 26, 2022, participants\nin the Company\u2019s 401(k) plan filed a putative class\naction in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Minnesota alleging that the Company\nviolated the Employee Retirement Income Security\nAct of 1974 in connection with certain of these\ntransactions. CONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION\nWells Fargo shareholders brought a putative\nsecurities fraud class action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New\nYork alleging that the Company and certain of its\ncurrent and former executive officers and directors\nmade false or misleading statements regarding the\nCompany\u2019s efforts to comply with the February 2018\nconsent order with the Federal Reserve Board and\nthe April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB and\nOCC. On September 8, 2023, the court granted final\napproval of an agreement pursuant to which the\nCompany paid $ 1.0billion to resolve this action.\nAllegations related to the Company\u2019s efforts to\ncomply with these three consent orders are also\namong the subjects of shareholder derivative\nlawsuits filed in California state and federal\ncourt. HIRING PRACTICES MATTERS Government\nagencies, including the United States Department of\nJustice and the SEC, have undertaken formal or\ninformal inquiries or investigations regarding the\nCompany\u2019s hiring practices related to diversity.\nThe United States Department of Justice has since\nclosed its investigation without taking action. A\nputative securities fraud class action has also\nbeen filed in the United States District Court for\nthe Northern District of California alleging that\nthe Company and certain of its executive officers\nmade false or misleading statements about the\nCompany\u2019s hiring practices related to diversity.\nAllegations related to the Company\u2019s hiring\npractices related to diversity are also among the\nsubjects of a shareholder derivative lawsuit\npending in the United States District Court for the\nNorthern District of California. INTERCHANGE\nLITIGATION Plaintiffs representing a class of\nmerchants have filed putative class actions, and\nindividual merchants have filed individual actions,\nagainst Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo &\nCompany, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and Wachovia\nCorporation regarding the interchange fees\nassociated with Visa and MasterCard payment card\ntransactions. Visa, MasterCard, and several other\nbanks and bank holding companies are also named as\ndefendants in these actions. These actions have\nbeen consolidated in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of New York. The\namended and consolidated complaint asserts claims\nagainst defendants based on alleged violations of\nfederal and state antitrust laws and seeks\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    95  \n                               \n                                                   \n  Note 10:Legal Actions(continued)                 \n                                                   \ndamages as well as\ninjunctive relief.\nPlaintiff merchants\nallege that Visa,\nMasterCard, and payment\ncard issuing banks\nunlawfully colluded to\nset interchange rates.\nPlaintiffs also allege\nthat enforcement of\ncertain Visa and\nMasterCard rules and\nalleged tying and\nbundling of services\noffered to merchants are\nanticompetitive. Wells\nFargo and Wachovia,\nalong with other\ndefendants and entities,\nare parties to Loss and\nJudgment Sharing\nAgreements, which\nprovide that they, along\nwith other entities,\nwill share, based on a\nformula, in any losses\nfrom the Interchange\nLitigation. On July 13,\n2012, Visa, MasterCard,\nand the financial\ninstitution defendants,\nincluding Wells Fargo,\nsigned a memorandum of\nunderstanding with\nplaintiff merchants to\nresolve the consolidated\nclass action and reached\na separate settlement in\nprinciple of the\nconsolidated individual\nactions. The settlement\npayments to be made by\nall defendants in the\nconsolidated class and\nindividual actions\ntotaled approximately $\n6.6billion before\nreductions applicable to\ncertain merchants opting\nout of the settlement.\nThe class settlement\nalso provided for the\ndistribution to class\nmerchants of 10 basis\npoints of default\ninterchange across all\ncredit rate categories\nfor a period of eight\nconsecutive months. The\ndistrict court granted\nfinal approval of the\nsettlement, which was\nappealed to the United\nStates Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit\nby settlement objector\nmerchants. Other\nmerchants opted out of\nthe settlement and are\npursuing several\nindividual actions. On\nJune 30, 2016, the\nSecond Circuit vacated\nthe settlement agreement\nand reversed and\nremanded the\nconsolidated action to\nthe United States\nDistrict Court for the\nEastern District of New\nYork for further\nproceedings. On November\n23, 2016, prior class\ncounsel filed a petition\nto the United States\nSupreme Court, seeking\nreview of the reversal\nof the settlement by the\nSecond Circuit, and the\nSupreme Court denied the\npetition on March 27,\n2017. On November 30,\n2016, the district court\nappointed lead class\ncounsel for a damages\nclass and an equitable\nrelief class. The\nparties have entered\ninto a settlement\nagreement to resolve the\ndamages class claims\npursuant to which\ndefendants will pay a\ntotal of approximately $\n6.2billion, which\nincludes approximately $\n5.3billion of funds\nremaining from the 2012\nsettlement and $\n900million in additional\nfunding. The Company\u2019s\nallocated responsibility\nfor the additional\nfunding is approximately\n$ 94.5million. The court\ngranted final approval\nof the settlement on\nDecember 13, 2019, which\nwas appealed to the\nUnited States Court of\nAppeals for the Second\nCircuit by settlement\nobjector merchants. On\nMarch 15, 2023, the\nSecond Circuit affirmed\nthe damages class\nsettlement. On September\n27, 2021, the district\ncourt granted the\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for\nclass certification in\nthe equitable relief\ncase. Several of the\nopt-out and direct\naction litigations have\nbeen settled while\nothers remain pending.\nRECORD-KEEPING\nINVESTIGATIONS The SEC\nand the United States\nCommodity Futures\nTrading Commission\n(CFTC) have undertaken\ninvestigations regarding\nthe Company\u2019s compliance\nwith records retention\nrequirements relating to\nbusiness communications\nsent over unapproved\nelectronic messaging\nchannels. In August\n2023, the Company\nentered into agreements\npursuant to which it\npaid $ 125million to the\nSEC and $ 75million to\nthe CFTC in order to\nresolve their\ninvestigations.\n\nRMBS TRUSTEE LITIGATION\nIn December 2014,\nPhoenix Light SF Limited\n(Phoenix Light) and\ncertain related entities\nfiled a complaint in the\nUnited States District\nCourt for the Southern\nDistrict of New York\nalleging claims against\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A.,\nin its capacity as\ntrustee for a number of\nresidential mortgage-\nbacked securities (RMBS)\ntrusts. Complaints\nraising similar\nallegations have been\nfiled by Commerzbank AG\nin the Southern District\nof New York, IKB\nInternational and IKB\nDeutsche Industriebank\n(together, IKB) in New\nYork state court, and\nPark Royal I LLC and\nPark Royal II LLC in New\nYork state court. In\neach case, the\nplaintiffs allege that\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A.,\nas trustee, caused\nlosses to investors, and\nplaintiffs assert causes\nof action based upon,\namong other things, the\ntrustee\u2019s alleged\nfailure to notify and\nenforce repurchase\nobligations of mortgage\nloan sellers for\npurported breaches of\nrepresentations and\nwarranties, notify\ninvestors of alleged\nevents of default, and\nabide by appropriate\nstandards of care\nfollowing alleged events\nof default. In July\n2022, the district court\ndismissed Phoenix\nLight\u2019s claims and\ncertain of the claims\nasserted by Commerzbank\nAG, and subsequently\nentered judgment in each\ncase in favor of Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A. In\nAugust 2022, Phoenix\nLight and Commerzbank AG\neach appealed the\ndistrict court\u2019s\ndecision to the United\nStates Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit.\nPhoenix Light dismissed\nits appeal in May 2023,\nterminating its case. In\nOctober 2023, the\nCompany reached an\nagreement in principle\nwith IKB to resolve\nIKB\u2019s claims. The\nCompany previously\nsettled twoclass actions\nfiled by institutional\ninvestors and an action\nfiled by the National\nCredit Union\nAdministration with\nsimilar allegations.\nSEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE\nLITIGATION The Seminole\nTribe of Florida filed a\ncomplaint in Florida\nstate court alleging\nthat Wells Fargo, as\ntrustee, charged excess\nfees in connection with\nthe administration of a\nminor\u2019s trust and failed\nto invest the assets of\nthe trust prudently. The\ncomplaint was later\namended to include\nthreeindividual current\nand former beneficiaries\nas plaintiffs and to\nremove the Tribe as a\nparty to the case.\nOUTLOOK As described\nabove, the Company\nestablishes accruals for\nlegal actions when\npotential losses\nassociated with the\nactions become probable\nand the costs can be\nreasonably estimated.\nThe high end of the\nrange of reasonably\npossible losses in\nexcess of the Company\u2019s\naccrual for probable and\nestimable losses was\napproximately $\n1.6billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2023. The\noutcomes of legal\nactions are\nunpredictable and\nsubject to significant\nuncertainties, and it is\ninherently difficult to\ndetermine whether any\nloss is probable or even\npossible. It is also\ninherently difficult to\nestimate the amount of\nany loss and there may\nbe matters for which a\nloss is probable or\nreasonably possible but\nnot currently estimable.\nAccordingly, actual\nlosses may be in excess\nof the established\naccrual or the range of\nreasonably possible\nloss. Based on\ninformation currently\navailable, advice of\ncounsel, available\ninsurance coverage, and\nestablished reserves,\nWells Fargo believes\nthat the eventual\noutcome of the actions\nagainst Wells Fargo\nand/or its subsidiaries\nwill not, individually\nor in the aggregate,\nhave a material adverse\neffect on Wells Fargo\u2019s\nconsolidated financial\ncondition. However, it\nis possible that the\nultimate resolution of a\nmatter, if unfavorable,\nmay be material to Wells\nFargo\u2019s results of\noperations for any\nparticular period.\n                               \n  96    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \n                       \n  Note 11:Derivatives  \n                       \nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to market\nrisk, including interest rate risk, credit risk and\nforeign currency risk, and to assist customers with\ntheir risk management objectives. We designate\ncertain derivatives as hedging instruments in\nqualifying hedge accounting relationships (fair\nvalue or cash flow hedges). Our remaining\nderivatives consist of economic hedges that do not\nqualify for hedge accounting and derivatives held\nfor customer accommodation trading or other\npurposes. For additional information on our\nderivatives activities, see Note 14 (Derivatives)\nin our 2022 Form 10-K. Table 11.1 presents the\ntotal notional or contractual amounts and fair\nvalues for our derivatives. Derivative transactions\ncan be measured in terms of the notional amount,\nbut this amount is not recorded on our consolidated\nbalance sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation,\na meaningful measure of the risk profile of the\ninstruments. The notional amount is generally not\nexchanged, but is used only as the basis on which\nderivative cash flows are determined.\nTable 11.1: Notional or Contractual Amounts and\nFair Values of Derivatives\n                                                   \n                                                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         4      \u2026      9      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2014      \u2026      \u2026      \u2014    \n                         \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n(1) In first quarter 2023, we adopted ASU 2018-12 \u2013\nFinancial Services \u2013 Insurance (Topic 944):\nTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-\nDuration Contracts . For additional information,\nsee Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies).\nBalance Sheet Offsetting We execute substantially\nall of our derivative transactions under master\nnetting arrangements. Where legally enforceable,\nthese master netting arrangements give the ability,\nin the event of default by the counterparty, to\nliquidate securities held as collateral and to\noffset receivables and payables with the same\ncounterparty. We reflect all derivative balances\nand related cash collateral subject to enforceable\nmaster netting arrangements on a net basis on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. We do not net non-cash\ncollateral that we receive or pledge against\nderivative balances on our consolidated balance\nsheet. For disclosure purposes, we present \u201cTotal\nDerivatives, net\u201d which represents the aggregate of\nour net exposure to each counterparty after\nconsidering the balance sheet netting adjustments\nand any non-cash collateral. We manage derivative\nexposure by monitoring the credit risk associated\nwith each counterparty using counterparty-specific\ncredit risk limits, using master netting\narrangements and obtaining collateral. Table 11.2\nprovides information on the fair values of\nderivative assets and liabilities subject to\nenforceable master netting arrangements, the\nbalance sheet netting adjustments and the resulting\nnet fair value amount recorded on our consolidated\nbalance sheet, as well as the non-cash collateral\nassociated with such arrangements. In addition to\nthe netting amounts included in the table, we also\nhave balance sheet netting related to resale and\nrepurchase agreements that are disclosed within\nNote 15 (Pledged Assets and

Counterparty valuation\nadjustments related to derivative assets were $\n284million and $ 372million and debit valuation\nadjustments related to derivative liabilities were\n$ 334million and $ 331million as of September 30,\n2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, and were\nprimarily related to interest rate contracts.\n\n(2) In first quarter 2023, we adopted ASU 2018-12 \u2013\nFinancial Services \u2013 Insurance (Topic 944):\nTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-\nDuration Contracts . For additional information,\nsee Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies).\n\nFair Value and Cash Flow Hedges For fair value\nhedges, we use interest rate swaps to convert\ncertain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and time\ncertificates of deposit to floating rates to hedge\nour exposure to interest rate risk. We also enter\ninto cross-currency swaps, cross-currency interest\nrate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our\nexposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate\nrisk associated with the issuance of non-U.S.\ndollar denominated long-term debt. We also enter\ninto futures contracts, forward contracts, and swap\ncontracts to hedge our exposure to the price risk\nof physical commodities included in Other Assets.\nIn addition, we use interest rate swaps, cross-\ncurrency swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps\nand forward contracts to hedge against changes in\nfair value of certain investments in available-for-\nsale (AFS) debt securities due to changes in\ninterest rates, foreign currency rates, or both.\nFor certain fair value hedges of interest rate\nrisk, we use the portfolio layer method to hedge\nstated amounts of closed portfolios of AFS debt\nsecurities. For certain fair value hedges of\nforeign currency risk, changes in fair value of\ncross-currency swaps attributable to changes in\ncross-currency basis spreads are excluded from the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded in\nother comprehensive income (OCI). See Note 20\n(Other Comprehensive Income) for the amounts\nrecognized in other comprehensive income. For cash\nflow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to hedge\nthe variability in interest payments received on\ncertain interest-earning deposits with banks and\ncertain floating-rate commercial loans. We also use\ncross-currency swaps to hedge variability in\ninterest payments on fixed-rate foreign currency-\ndenominated long-term debt due to changes in\nforeign exchange rates. We estimate $ 976million\npre-tax of deferred net losses related to cash flow\nhedges in OCI at September 30, 2023, will be\nreclassified into net interest income during the\nnext twelve months. For cash flow hedges as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, we are hedging our interest\nrate and foreign currency exposure to the\nvariability of future cash flows for all forecasted\ntransactions for a maximum of 9years. For\nadditional information on our accounting hedges,\nsee Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies) in our 2022 Form 10-K.

See Note\n1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPolicies) in our 2022\nForm 10-K for discussion\nof how we determine fair\nvalue. For descriptions\nof the valuation\nmethodologies we use for\nassets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value\non a recurring or\nnonrecurring basis, see\nNote 15 (Fair Values of\nAssets and Liabilities)\nin our 2022 Form 10-K.\n\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY We\nclassify our assets and\nliabilities recorded at\nfair value as either\nLevel 1, 2, or 3 in the\nfair value hierarchy.\nThe highest priority\n(Level 1) is assigned to\nvaluations based on\nunadjusted quoted prices\nin active markets and\nthe lowest priority\n(Level 3) is assigned to\nvaluations based on\nsignificant unobservable\ninputs. See Note 1\n(Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) in\nour 2022 Form 10-K for a\ndetailed description of\nthe fair value\nhierarchy. In the\ndetermination of the\nclassification of\nfinancial instruments in\nLevel 2 or Level 3 of\nthe fair value\nhierarchy, we consider\nall available\ninformation, including\nobservable market data,\nindications of market\nliquidity and\norderliness, and our\nunderstanding of the\nvaluation techniques and\nsignificant inputs used.\nThis determination is\nultimately based upon\nthe specific facts and\ncircumstances of each\ninstrument or instrument\ncategory and judgments\nare made regarding the\nsignificance of the\nunobservable inputs to\nthe instruments\u2019 fair\nvalue measurement in its\nentirety.

This table also excludes assets and\nliabilities that are not financial instruments such\nas the value of the long-term relationships with\nour deposit, credit card and trust customers, MSRs,\npremises and equipment, goodwill and deferred\ntaxes. Loan commitments, standby letters of credit\nand commercial and similar letters of credit are\nnot included in Table 12.9. A reasonable estimate\nof the fair value of these instruments is the\ncarrying value of deferred fees plus the allowance\nfor unfunded credit commitments, which totaled $\n602million and $ 737million at September 30, 2023,\nand December 31, 2022, respectively.

SPEs are often formed in\nconnection with securitization transactions whereby\nfinancial assets are transferred to an SPE. SPEs\nformed in connection with securitization\ntransactions are generally considered variable\ninterest entities (VIEs). The VIE may alter the\nrisk profile of the asset by entering into\nderivative transactions or obtaining credit\nsupport, and issues various forms of interests in\nthose assets to investors. When we transfer\nfinancial assets from our consolidated balance\nsheet to a VIE in connection with a securitization,\nwe typically receive cash and sometimes other\ninterests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets we\ntransfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may\nretain the right to service the transferred assets\nand repurchase the transferred assets if the\noutstanding balance of the assets falls below the\nlevel at which the cost to service the assets\nexceed the benefits. In addition, we may purchase\nthe right to service loans transferred to a VIE by\na third party. In connection with our\nsecuritization or other VIE activities, we have\nvarious forms of ongoing involvement with VIEs,\nwhich may include: \u2022 underwriting securities issued\nby VIEs and subsequently making markets in those\nsecurities; \u2022 providing credit enhancement on\nsecurities issued by VIEs through the use of\nletters of credit or financial guarantees; \u2022\nentering into other derivative contracts with VIEs;\n\u2022 holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs;\n\u2022 acting as servicer or investment manager for\nVIEs; \u2022 providing administrative or trustee\nservices to VIEs; and \u2022 providing seller financing\nto VIEs. Loan Sales and Securitization Activity We\nperiodically transfer consumer and commercial loans\nand other types of financial assets in\nsecuritization and whole loan sale transactions.\nMORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED\nENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE In the\nnormal course of business we sell residential and\ncommercial mortgage loans to government-sponsored\nentities (GSEs). These loans are generally\ntransferred into securitizations sponsored by the\nGSEs, which provide certain credit guarantees to\ninvestors and servicers. We also transfer mortgage\nloans into securitization pools pursuant to\nGovernment National Mortgage Association (GNMA)\nguidelines which are insured by the Federal Housing\nAdministration (FHA) or guaranteed by the\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA). Mortgage loans\neligible for securitization with the GSEs or GNMA\nare considered conforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA\ndesign the structure of these securitizations,\nsponsor the involved VIEs, and have power over the\nactivities most significant to the VIE. We account\nfor loans transferred in conforming mortgage loan\nsecuritization transactions as sales and do not\nconsolidate the VIEs as we are not the primary\nbeneficiary. In exchange for the transfer of loans,\nwe typically receive securities issued by the VIEs\nwhich we sell to third parties for cash or hold for\ninvestment purposes as HTM or AFS securities. We\nalso retain servicing rights on the transferred\nloans. As a servicer, we retain the option to\nrepurchase loans from certain loan securitizations,\nwhich becomes exercisable based on delinquency\nstatus such as when three scheduled loan payments\nare past due. When we have the unilateral option to\nrepurchase a loan, we recognize the loan and a\ncorresponding liability on our balance sheet\nregardless of our intent to repurchase the loan,\nand the loans remain pledged to the securitization.\nAt September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we\nrecorded assets and related liabilities of $\n1.1billion and $ 743million, respectively, where we\ndid not exercise our option to repurchase eligible\nloans. We repurchased loans of $ 49million and $\n240million, during the third quarter and first nine\nmonths of 2023, respectively, and $ 574million and\n$ 2.1billion during the third quarter and first\nnine months of 2022, respectively. Upon transfers\nof loans, we also provide indemnification for\nlosses incurred due to material breaches of\ncontractual representations and warranties as well\nas other recourse arrangements. At September 30,\n2023, and December 31, 2022, our liability for\nthese repurchase and recourse arrangements was $\n185million and $ 167million, respectively, and the\nmaximum exposure to loss was $ 13.5billion and $\n13.8billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively. Substantially all residential\nservicing activity is related to assets transferred\nto GSE and GNMA securitizations. See Note 6\n(Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional\ninformation about residential and commercial\nservicing rights, advances and servicing fees.\nNONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS In the\nnormal course of business, we sell nonconforming\nmortgage loans in securitization transactions that\nwe design and sponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan\nsecuritizations do not involve a government credit\nguarantee, and accordingly, beneficial interest\nholders are subject to credit risk of the\nunderlying assets held by the securitization VIE.\nWe typically originate the transferred loans and\naccount for the transfers as sales. We also\ntypically retain the right to service the loans and\nmay hold other beneficial interests issued by the\nVIE, such as debt securities held for investment\npurposes. Our servicing role related to\nnonconforming commercial mortgage loan\nsecuritizations is limited to primary or master\nservicer. We do not consolidate the VIE because the\nmost significant decisions impacting the\nperformance of the VIE are generally made by the\nspecial servicer or the controlling class security\nholder. For our residential nonconforming mortgage\nloan securitizations accounted for as sales, we\neither do not hold variable interests that we\nconsider potentially significant or are not the\nprimary servicer for a majority of the VIE assets.\nWHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We may also sell whole\nloans to VIEs where we have continuing involvement\nin the form of financing. We account for these\ntransfers as sales, and do not consolidate the VIEs\nas we do not have the power to direct the most\nsignificant activities of the VIEs. Table 13.1\npresents information about transfers of assets\nduring the periods presented for which we recorded\nthe transfers as sales and have continuing\ninvolvement with the transferred assets. In\nconnection with these transfers, we received\nproceeds and recorded servicing assets and\nsecurities. Each of these interests are initially\nmeasured at fair value. Servicing rights are\nclassified as Level 3 measurements, and generally\nsecurities are classified as Level 2. The majority\nof our transfers relate to residential mortgage\nsecuritizations with the GSEs or GNMA and\n                                \n  114    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \ngenerally result in nogain or loss because the\nloans are measured at fair value on a recurring\nbasis. Additionally, we may transfer certain\ngovernment insured loans that we previously\nrepurchased. These loans are carried at the lower\nof cost or market, and we recognize gains on such\ntransfers when the market value is greater than the\ncarrying value of the loan when it is sold.\n\nTable 13.1: Transfers with Continuing Involvement\n                                                   \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                      2\u2026                    2\u2026  \n  \u2026           R\u2026         C\u2026         R\u2026         C\u2026  \n  \u2026           m\u2026         m\u2026         m\u2026         m\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026    $  2\u2026        3,\u2026        14\u2026        3,\u2026      \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026       2\u2026        3,\u2026        14\u2026        3,\u2026      \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026        \u2014         54          \u2014         60      \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026    $  36         27        193         32      \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026        \u2014         39          \u2014         39      \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026    $  1\u2026        6,\u2026        64\u2026        11\u2026      \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026       1\u2026        6,\u2026        64\u2026        11\u2026      \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026        \u2014        118         52        190      \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026    $  1\u2026         61        833        102      \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026                                                \n  \u2026        \u2014         87        2,\u2026        176      \n  \u2026                                                \n                                                   \n(1) Represents cash\nproceeds and the fair\nvalue of non-cash\nbeneficial interests\nrecognized at\nsecuritization\nsettlement.\n\n(2) Represents assets or\nliabilities recognized\nat securitization\nsettlement date related\nto our continuing\ninvolvement in the\ntransferred assets.\n\n(3) Represents debt\nsecurities obtained at\nsecuritization\nsettlement held for\ninvestment purposes that\nare classified as\navailable-for-sale or\nheld-to-maturity.

In\nresecuritization transactions, we transfer trading\ndebt securities to VIEs in exchange for new\nbeneficial interests that are sold to third parties\nat or shortly after securitization settlement. This\nactivity is performed for customers seeking a\nspecific return or risk profile. Substantially all\nof our transactions involve the resecuritization of\nconforming mortgage-backed securities issued by the\nGSEs or guaranteed by GNMA. We do not consolidate\nthe resecuritization VIEs as we share in the\ndecision-making power with third parties and do not\nhold significant economic interests in the VIEs\nother than for market-making activities. During the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we\ntransferred securities of $ 10.6billion and $\n15.7billion, respectively, to resecuritization\nVIEs, and retained securities of $ 284million and $\n622million, respectively. These amounts are not\nincluded in Table 13.1. Related total VIE assets\nwere $ 111.9billion and $ 112.0billion at September\n30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. As\nof September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we\nheld $ 1.1billion and $ 793million of securities,\nrespectively.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    115  \n                                \nNote 13: Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities (continued)\n\nSold or Securitized Loans Serviced for Others Table\n13.3 presents information about loans that we have\noriginated and sold or securitized in which we have\nongoing involvement as servicer. For loans sold or\nsecuritized where servicing is our only form of\ncontinuing involvement, we generally experience a\nloss only if we were required to repurchase a\ndelinquent loan or foreclosed asset due to a breach\nin representations and warranties associated with\nour loan sale or servicing contracts. Table 13.3\nexcludes mortgage loans sold to and held or\nsecuritized by GSEs or GNMA of $ 621.1billion and $\n704.5billion at September 30, 2023, and December\n31, 2022, respectively. Delinquent loans include\nloans 90 days or more past due and loans in\nbankruptcy, regardless of delinquency status.\nDelinquent loans and foreclosed assets related to\nloans sold to and held or securitized by GSEs or\nGNMA were $ 3.4billion and $ 4.6billion at\nSeptember 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively.\n\nTable 13.3: Sold or Securitized Loans Serviced for\nOthers\n                                                   \n                    \u2026                              \n                    \u2026                              \n            \u2026       \u2026                              \n            \u2026       \u2026                              \n            \u2026       \u2026                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      $  \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n(1) Includes $ 184million and $ 274million of\ncommercial foreclosed assets and $ 29million and $\n25million of residential foreclosed assets at\nSeptember 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively.\n\nTransactions with Unconsolidated VIEs MORTGAGE LOAN\nSECURITIZATIONS Table 13.4 includes nonconforming\nmortgage loan securitizations where we originate\nand transfer the loans to the unconsolidated\nsecuritization VIEs that we sponsor. For additional\ninformation about these VIEs, see the \u201cLoan Sales\nand Securitization Activity\u201d section within this\nNote. Nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations\nalso include commercial mortgage loan\nsecuritizations sponsored by third parties where we\ndid not originate or transfer the loans but serve\nas master servicer and invest in securities that\ncould be potentially significant to the VIE.\nConforming loan securitization and resecuritization\ntransactions involving the GSEs and GNMA are\nexcluded from Table 13.4 because we are not the\nsponsor or we do not have power over the activities\nmost significant to the VIEs. Additionally, due to\nthe nature of the guarantees provided by the GSEs\nand the FHA and VA, our credit risk associated with\nthese VIEs is limited. For additional information\nabout conforming mortgage loan securitizations and\nresecuritizations, see the \u201cLoan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity\u201d and \u201cResecuritization\nActivities\u201d sections within this Note. COMMERCIAL\nREAL ESTATE LOANS We may transfer purchased\nindustrial development bonds and GSE credit\nenhancements to VIEs in exchange for beneficial\ninterests. We may also acquire such beneficial\ninterests in transactions where we do not act as a\ntransferor. We own all of the beneficial interests\nand may also service the underlying mortgages that\nserve as collateral to the bonds. The GSEs have the\npower to direct the servicing and workout\nactivities of the VIE in the event of a default,\ntherefore we do not have control over the key\ndecisions of the VIEs. OTHER VIE STRUCTURES We\nengage in various forms of structured finance\narrangements with other VIEs, including asset-\nbacked finance structures and other securitizations\ncollateralized by asset classes other than\nmortgages. Collateral may include rental\nproperties, asset-backed securities, student loans\nand mortgage loans. We may participate in\nstructuring or marketing the arrangements as well\nas provide financing, service one or more of the\nunderlying assets, or enter into derivatives with\nthe VIEs. We may also receive fees for those\nservices. We are not the primary beneficiary of\nthese structures because we do not have power to\ndirect the most significant activities of the VIEs.\nTable 13.4 provides a summary of our exposure to\nthe unconsolidated VIEs described above, which\nincludes investments in securities, loans,\nguarantees, liquidity agreements, commitments and\ncertain derivatives. We exclude certain\ntransactions with unconsolidated VIEs when our\ncontinuing involvement is temporary or\nadministrative in nature or insignificant in size.\nIn Table 13.4, \u201cTotal VIE assets\u201d represents the\nremaining principal balance of assets held by\nunconsolidated VIEs using the most current\ninformation available. \u201cCarrying value\u201d is the\namount in our consolidated balance sheet related to\nour involvement with the unconsolidated VIEs.\n\u201cMaximum exposure to loss\u201d is determined as the\ncarrying value of our investment in the VIEs\nexcluding the unconditional repurchase options that\nhave not been exercised, plus the remaining undrawn\nliquidity and lending commitments, the notional\namount of net written derivative contracts, and\ngenerally the notional amount of, or stressed loss\nestimate for, other commitments and guarantees.\nDebt, guarantees and other commitments include\namounts related to lending arrangements, liquidity\nagreements, and certain loss sharing obligations\nassociated with loans originated, sold, and\nserviced under certain GSE programs. \u201cMaximum\nexposure to loss\u201d represents estimated loss that\nwould be incurred under severe, hypothetical\ncircumstances, for which we believe the possibility\nis extremely remote, such as where the value of our\ninterests and any associated collateral declines to\nzero, without any consideration of recovery or\noffset from any economic hedges. Accordingly, this\ndisclosure is not an indication of expected loss.\n                                \n  116    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nTable 13.4: Unconsolidated VIEs\n                                                   \n                                                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                       \u2014      \u2026    \n                                       \u2014      \u2026    \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                       \u2014      \u2026    \n                                       \u2014      \u2026    \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n(1) Includes $ 234million and $ 172million of\nsecurities classified as trading at September 30,\n2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n\n(2) All other assets includes mortgage servicing\nrights, derivative assets, and other assets\n(predominantly servicing advances).\n\nINVOLVEMENT WITH TAX CREDIT VIES In addition to the\nunconsolidated VIEs in Table 13.4, we may invest in\nor provide funding to affordable housing, renewable\nenergy or similar projects that are designed to\ngenerate a return primarily through the realization\nof federal tax credits and other tax benefits. The\nprojects are typically managed by third-party\nsponsors who have the power over the VIE\u2019s assets,\ntherefore, we do not consolidate the VIEs. The\ncarrying value of our equity investments in tax\ncredit VIEs was $ 18.7billion at both September 30,\n2023, and December 31, 2022. We also had loans to\ntax credit VIEs with a carrying value of $\n2.2billion and $ 2.0billion at September 30, 2023,\nand December 31, 2022, respectively. Our maximum\nexposure to loss for tax credit VIEs at September\n30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, was $ 29.3billion\nand $ 28.0billion, respectively. Our maximum\nexposure to loss included total unfunded equity and\nlending commitments of $ 8.4billion and $\n7.3billion at September 30, 2023, and December 31,\n2022, respectively. See Note 14 (Guarantees and\nOther Commitments) for additional information about\ncommitments to purchase equity securities. Our\naffordable housing equity investments qualify for\nthe low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC). For\nadditional information on our LIHTC investments,\nsee Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities) in our 2022 Form 10-K. Consolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs where we are the primary\nbeneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of the\nfollowing structure types: COMMERCIAL AND\nINDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASES We may securitize\ndealer floor plan loans in a revolving master trust\nentity. As servicer and residual interest holder,\nwe control the key decisions of the trust and\nconsolidate the entity. The total VIE assets held\nby the master trust represent a majority of the\ntotal VIE assets presented for this category in\nTable 13.5. In a separate transaction structure, we\nmay provide the majority of debt and equity\nfinancing to an SPE that engages in lending and\nleasing to specific vendors and service the\nunderlying collateral. OTHER VIE STRUCTURES Other\nVIEs relate to total return swaps and municipal\ntender option bond (MTOB) transactions.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    117  \n                                \nNote 13: Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities (continued)\nTable 13.5 presents a summary of financial assets\nand liabilities of our consolidated VIEs.

On our consolidated balance sheet, we\nseparately disclose (1) the consolidated assets of\ncertain VIEs that can only be used to settle the\nliabilities of those VIEs, and (2) the consolidated\nliabilities of certain VIEs for which the VIE\ncreditors do not have recourse to Wells Fargo.\nTable 13.5: Transactions with Consolidated VIEs\n                                                   \n                 C\u2026                                \n                 v\u2026                    \u2026           \n            \u2026     \u2013                    \u2026           \n            \u2026    a\u2026           \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n            \u2026    (\u2026  \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026       4\u2026        \u2014       2\u2026       -\u2026     \n         \u2026        \u2014        \u2014       86        \u2014     \n      $  \u2026       4\u2026        \u2014       2\u2026       -\u2026     \n                                                   \n      $  \u2026       4\u2026        \u2014       1\u2026       -\u2026     \n         \u2026        \u2014       71        1       -\u2026     \n      $  \u2026       4\u2026       71       1\u2026       -\u2026     \n                                                   \n(1) All other assets includes cash and due from\nbanks, and other assets.\n(2) Liabilities include short-term borrowings, and\naccrued expenses and other liabilities.\n                                                   \n  Other Transactions                               \n                                                   \nIn addition to the\ntransactions included in\nthe previous tables, we\nhave used wholly-owned\ntrust preferred security\nVIEs to issue debt\nsecurities or preferred\nequity exclusively to\nthird-party investors.\nAs the sole assets of\nthe VIEs are receivables\nfrom us, we do not\nconsolidate the VIEs\neven though we own all\nof the voting equity\nshares of the VIEs, have\nfully guaranteed the\nobligations of the VIEs,\nand may have the right\nto redeem the third-\nparty securities under\ncertain circumstances.\nOn our consolidated\nbalance sheet, we\nreported the debt\nsecurities issued to the\nVIEs as long-term junior\nsubordinated debt with a\ncarrying value of $\n411million and $\n401million at September\n30, 2023, and December\n31, 2022, respectively.\n                                \n  118    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \n                                            \n  Note 14:Guarantees and Other Commitments  \n                                            \nGuarantees are contracts that contingently require\nus to make payments to a guaranteed party based on\nan event or a change in an underlying asset,\nliability, rate or index.

Estimated maximum\nexposure to loss was $ 52million and $ 157million\nwith related collateral of $ 558million and $\n1.3billion as of September 30, 2023, and December\n31, 2022, respectively.\nMaximum exposure to loss represents the estimated\nloss that would be incurred under an assumed\nhypothetical circumstance, despite what we believe\nis a remote possibility, where the value of our\ninterests and any associated collateral declines to\nzero. Maximum exposure to loss estimates in Table\n14.1 do not reflect economic hedges or collateral\nwe could use to offset or recover losses we may\nincur under our guarantee agreements. Accordingly,\nthese amounts are not an indication of expected\nloss. We believe the carrying value is more\nrepresentative of our current exposure to loss than\nmaximum exposure to loss. The carrying value\nrepresents the fair value of the guarantee, if any,\nand also includes an ACL for guarantees, if\napplicable. In determining the ACL for guarantees,\nwe consider the credit risk of the related\ncontingent obligation. For our guarantees in Table\n14.1, non-investment grade represents those\nguarantees on which we have a higher risk of\nperformance under the terms of the guarantee, which\nis determined based on an external rating or an\ninternal credit grade that is below investment\ngrade. WRITTEN OPTIONS We enter into written\nforeign currency options and over-the-counter\nwritten equity put options that are derivative\ncontracts that have the characteristics of a\nguarantee. The fair value of written options\nrepresents our view of the probability that we will\nbe required to perform under the contract. The fair\nvalue of these written options was an asset of $\n127million and a liability of $ 15million at\nSeptember 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively. The fair value may be an asset as a\nresult of deferred premiums on certain option\ntrades. The maximum exposure to loss represents the\nnotional value of these derivative contracts. At\nSeptember 30, 2023, the maximum exposure to loss\nwas $ 38.3billion, with $ 35.4billion expiring in\nthree years or less compared with $ 23.4billion and\n$ 21.3billion, respectively, at December 31, 2022.\nSee Note 11 (Derivatives) for additional\ninformation regarding written derivative contracts.\nREPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES We record a liability\nfor mortgage loans that we expect to repurchase\npursuant to various representations or warranties.\nSee Note 13 (Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities) for further discussion and related\namounts. Additionally, when we sell MSRs, we may\nprovide indemnifications for losses incurred due to\nmaterial breaches of contractual representations or\nwarranties as well as other recourse arrangements.\nAt September 30, 2023, our liability for these\nindemnification arrangements was $ 10million and\nthe maximum exposure to loss was $ 844million, with\n$ 609million expiring in three years or less.\nMERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES We provide debit and\ncredit card transaction processing services through\npayment networks directly for merchants and as a\nsponsor for merchant processing servicers,\nincluding our joint venture with a third party that\nis accounted for as an equity method investment. In\nour role as the merchant acquiring bank, we have a\npotential obligation in connection with payment and\ndelivery disputes between the merchant and the\ncardholder that are resolved in favor of the\ncardholder, referred to as a charge-back\ntransaction. We estimate our potential maximum\nexposure to be the total merchant transaction\nvolume processed in the preceding four months,\nwhich is generally the lifecycle for a charge-back\ntransaction. As of September 30, 2023, our\npotential maximum exposure was approximately $\n780.0billion, and related losses, including those\nfrom our joint venture entity, were insignificant.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    119  \n                                \nNote 14: Guarantees and\nOther Commitments\n(continued)\n\nGUARANTEES OF\nSUBSIDIARIES The Parent\nfully and\nunconditionally\nguarantees the payment\nof principal, interest,\nand any other amounts\nthat may be due on\nsecurities that its 100%\nowned finance\nsubsidiary, Wells Fargo\nFinance LLC, may\nissue.These securities\nare not guaranteed by\nany other subsidiary of\nthe Parent. The\nguaranteed liabilities\nwere $ 826million and $\n948million at September\n30, 2023, and December\n31, 2022, respectively.\nThese guarantees rank on\nparity with all of the\nParent\u2019s other unsecured\nand unsubordinated\nindebtedness. OTHER\nCOMMITMENTS We may enter\ninto commitments to\npurchase debt and equity\nsecurities for various\nbusiness or investment\npurposes. As of both\nSeptember 30, 2023, and\nDecember 31, 2022, we\nhad commitments to\npurchase debt securities\nof $ 100million and\ncommitments to purchase\nequity securities of $\n8.9billion and $\n3.8billion,\nrespectively. As of\nSeptember 30, 2023, our\ncommitments to purchase\nequity securities\npredominantly included\nFederal Reserve Bank\nstock and renewable\nenergy investments. As\npart of maintaining our\nmemberships in certain\nclearing organizations,\nwe are required to stand\nready to provide\nliquidity to sustain\nmarket clearing activity\nin the event unforeseen\nevents occur or are\ndeemed likely to occur.\nCertain of these\nobligations are\nguarantees of other\nmembers\u2019 performance and\naccordingly are included\nin Table 14.1 in Other\nguarantees and\nindemnifications.\n\nWe have commitments to\nenter into resale and\nsecurities borrowing\nagreements as well as\nrepurchase and\nsecurities lending\nagreements with certain\ncounterparties,\nincluding central\nclearing organizations.\nThe amount of our\nunfunded contractual\ncommitments for resale\nand securities borrowing\nagreements was $\n14.5billion and $\n19.9billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, and\nDecember 31, 2022,\nrespectively. The amount\nof our unfunded\ncontractual commitments\nfor repurchase and\nsecurities lending\nagreements was $\n3.8billion and $\n1.6billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, and\nDecember 31, 2022,\nrespectively. Given the\nnature of these\ncommitments, they are\nexcluded from Table 5.4\n(Unfunded Credit\nCommitments) in Note 5\n(Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses).\n                                \n  120    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \n                                         \n  Note 15:Pledged Assets and Collateral  \n                                         \nPledged Assets Table 15.1 provides the carrying\namount of on-balance sheet pledged assets as well\nas the fair value of other pledged collateral not\nrecognized on our consolidated balance sheet, which\nwe have received from third parties, have the right\nto repledge and have repledged. These amounts\ninclude assets pledged in transactions accounted\nfor as secured borrowings, which are presented\nparenthetically on our consolidated balance sheet.\nTRADING RELATED ACTIVITY Our trading businesses may\npledge debt and equity securities in connection\nwith securities sold under agreements to repurchase\n(repurchase agreements) and securities lending\narrangements. The collateral that we pledge related\nto our trading activities may include our own\ncollateral as well as collateral that we have\nreceived from third parties and have the right to\nrepledge. Substantially all of the collateral we\npledge related to trading activity is eligible to\nbe repledged or sold by the secured party. NON-\nTRADING RELATED ACTIVITY As part of our liquidity\nmanagement strategy, we may pledge loans, debt\nsecurities, and other financial assets to secure\ntrust and public deposits, borrowings and letters\nof credit from Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (FRB) and for other purposes as required or\npermitted by law or insurance statutory\nrequirements. Substantially all of the non-trading\nactivity pledged collateral is not eligible to be\nrepledged or sold by the secured party. VIE RELATED\nWe pledge assets in connection with various types\nof transactions entered into with VIEs. These\npledged assets can only be used to settle the\nliabilities of those entities. We also have loans\nrecorded on our consolidated balance sheet which\nrepresent certain delinquent loans that are\neligible for repurchase from GNMA loan\nsecuritizations.

These activities are\nconducted through our broker-dealer subsidiaries\nand, to a lesser extent, through other bank\nentities. Our securities financing activities\nprimarily involve high-quality, liquid securities\nsuch as U.S. Treasury securities and government\nagency securities and, to a lesser extent, less\nliquid securities, including equity securities,\ncorporate bonds and asset-backed securities. We\naccount for these transactions as collateralized\nfinancings in which we typically receive or pledge\nsecurities as collateral. We believe these\nfinancing transactions generally do not have\nmaterial credit risk given the collateral provided\nand the related monitoring processes. We also enter\ninto resale agreements involving collateral other\nthan securities, such as loans, as part of our\ncommercial lending business activities. OFFSETTING\nOF SECURITIES AND OTHER COLLATERALIZED FINANCING\nACTIVITIES Table 15.2 presents resale and\nrepurchase agreements subject to master repurchase\nagreements (MRA) and securities borrowing and\nlending agreements subject to master securities\nlending agreements (MSLA). Where legally\nenforceable, these master netting arrangements give\nthe ability, in the event of default by the\ncounterparty, to liquidate securities held as\ncollateral and to offset receivables and payables\nwith the same counterparty. Collateralized\nfinancings, and those with a single counterparty,\nare presented net on our consolidated balance\nsheet, provided certain criteria are met that\npermit balance sheet netting. The majority of\ntransactions subject to these agreements do not\nmeet those criteria and thus are not eligible for\nbalance sheet netting.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    121  \n                                \nNote 15: Pledged Assets and Collateral (continued)\n\nCollateral we pledged consists of non-cash\ninstruments, such as securities or loans, and is\nnot netted on our consolidated balance sheet\nagainst the related liability. Collateral we\nreceived includes securities or loans and is not\nrecognized on our consolidated balance sheet.\nCollateral pledged or received may be increased or\ndecreased over time to maintain certain contractual\nthresholds, as the assets underlying each\narrangement fluctuate in value. Generally, these\nagreements require collateral to exceed the asset\nor liability recognized on the balance sheet. The\nfollowing table includes the amount of collateral\npledged or received related to exposures subject to\nenforceable MRAs or MSLAs. While these agreements\nare typically over-collateralized, U.S. GAAP\nrequires disclosure in this table to limit the\nreported amount of such collateral to the amount of\nthe related recognized asset or liability for each\ncounterparty. In addition to the amounts included\nin Table 15.2, we also have balance sheet netting\nrelated to derivatives that is disclosed in Note 11\n(Derivatives).\n\nTable 15.2: Offsetting \u2013 Securities

In these\ntransactions, we receive cash in exchange for\ntransferring securities as collateral and recognize\nan obligation to reacquire the securities for cash\nat the transaction\u2019s maturity. These types of\ntransactions create risks, including (1) the\ncounterparty may fail to return the securities at\nmaturity, (2) the fair value of the securities\ntransferred may decline below the amount of our\nobligation to reacquire the securities, and\ntherefore create an obligation for us to pledge\nadditional amounts, and (3) the counterparty may\naccelerate the maturity on demand, requiring us to\nreacquire the security prior to contractual\nmaturity. We attempt to mitigate these risks in\nvarious ways. Our collateral primarily consists of\nhighly liquid securities.

All other business activities that are\nnot included in the reportable operating segments\nhave been included in Corporate. We define our\nreportable operating segments by type of product\nand customer segment, and their results are based\non our management reporting process. The management\nreporting process measures the performance of the\nreportable operating segments based on the\nCompany\u2019s management structure, and the results are\nregularly reviewed with our Chief Executive Officer\nand relevant senior management. The management\nreporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and\nincludes specific adjustments, such as funds\ntransfer pricing for asset/liability management,\nshared revenue and expenses, and taxable-equivalent\nadjustments to consistently reflect income from\ntaxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows\nmanagement to assess performance consistently\nacross the operating segments. Consumer Banking and\nLending offers diversified financial products and\nservices for consumers and small businesses with\nannual sales generally up to $ 10million. These\nfinancial products and services include checking\nand savings accounts, credit and debit cards as\nwell as home, auto, personal, and small business\nlending. Commercial Banking provides financial\nsolutions to private, family owned and certain\npublic companies. Products and services include\nbanking and credit products across multiple\nindustry sectors and municipalities, secured\nlending and lease products, and treasury\nmanagement. Corporate and Investment Banking\ndelivers a suite of capital markets, banking, and\nfinancial products and services to corporate,\ncommercial real estate, government and\ninstitutional clients globally. Products and\nservices include corporate banking, investment\nbanking, treasury management, commercial real\nestate lending and servicing, equity and fixed\nincome solutions as well as sales, trading, and\nresearch capabilities. Wealth and Investment\nManagement provides personalized wealth management,\nbrokerage, financial planning, lending, private\nbanking, trust and fiduciary products and services\nto affluent, high-net worth and ultra-high-net\nworth clients. We operate through financial\nadvisors in our brokerage and wealth offices,\nconsumer bank branches, independent offices, and\ndigitally through WellsTrade \u00ae and Intuitive\nInvestor \u00ae. Corporate includes corporate treasury\nand enterprise functions, net of allocations\n(including funds transfer pricing, capital,\nliquidity and certain expenses), in support of the\nreportable operating segments, as well as our\ninvestment portfolio and venture capital and\nprivate equity investments. Corporate also includes\ncertain lines of business that management has\ndetermined are no longer consistent with the long-\nterm strategic goals of the Company as well as\nresults for previously divested businesses. In\nthird quarter 2023, we sold investments in certain\nprivate equity funds, which had a minimal impact to\nnet income. Basis of Presentation FUNDS TRANSFER\nPRICING Corporate treasury manages a funds transfer\npricing methodology that considers interest rate\nrisk, liquidity risk, and other product\ncharacteristics. Operating segments pay a funding\ncharge for their assets and receive a funding\ncredit for their deposits, both of which are\nincluded in net interest income. The net impact of\nthe funding charges or credits is recognized in\ncorporate treasury. REVENUE AND EXPENSE SHARING\nWhen lines of business jointly serve customers, the\nline of business that is responsible for providing\nthe product or service recognizes revenue or\nexpense with a referral fee paid or an allocation\nof cost to the other line of business based on\nestablished internal revenue-sharing agreements.\nWhen a line of business uses a service provided by\nanother line of business or enterprise function\n(included in Corporate), expense is generally\nallocated based on the cost and use of the service\nprovided. TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS Taxable-\nequivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income\non certain loans and debt securities are included\nin net interest income, while taxable-equivalent\nadjustments related to income tax credits for low-\nincome housing and renewable energy investments are\nincluded in noninterest income, in each case with\ncorresponding impacts to income tax expense\n(benefit). Adjustments are included in Corporate,\nCommercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment\nBanking and are eliminated to reconcile to the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated financial results.\n

In\nMay 2023, the FDIC proposed a rule to recover by\nspecial assessment losses to the FDIC deposit\ninsurance fund as a result of bank failures in the\nfirst half of 2023. Under the proposed rule, the\nFDIC would collect a special assessment based on a\ncalculation using an insured depository\ninstitution\u2019s estimated amount of uninsured\ndeposits. As currently proposed, the amount of our\nspecial assessment may be up to $ 1.8billion (pre-\ntax). We expect to expense the entire amount upon\nthe FDIC\u2019s finalization of the rule, which we\nexpect to occur in fourth quarter 2023. The\nproposed rule may be changed prior to finalization\nand any changes may affect the timing or amount of\nthe special assessment.\n                                \n  128    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \n                             \n  Note 18:Employee Benefits  \n                             \nPension and Postretirement Plans We sponsor a\nfrozen noncontributory qualified defined benefit\nretirement plan, the Wells Fargo & Company Cash\nBalance Plan (Cash Balance Plan), which covers\neligible employees of Wells Fargo.

We must calculate\nour risk-based capital ratios under both the\nStandardized and Advanced Approaches. The\nStandardized Approach applies assigned risk weights\nto broad risk categories, while the calculation of\nrisk-weighted assets (RWAs) under the Advanced\nApproach differs by requiring applicable banks to\nutilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies\nupon the use of internal credit models, and\nincludes an operational risk component.

The\nG-SIB surcharge is not applicable to the Bank. In\naddition, the CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratio\nrequirements for the Company included a stress\ncapital buffer of 3.20% under the Standardized\nApproach and a capital conservation buffer of 2.50%\nunder the Advanced Approach. The capital ratio\nrequirements for the Bank included a capital\nconservation buffer of 2.50% under both the\nStandardized and Advanced Approaches. The Company\nis required to maintain these risk-based capital\nratios and to maintain a supplementary leverage\nratio (SLR) of at least 5.00% (composed of a 3.00%\nminimum requirement plus a supplementary leverage\nbuffer of 2.00%) to avoid restrictions on capital\ndistributions and discretionary bonus payments.
