As of December 31,\n2023, we had four reportable\noperating segments for management\nreporting purposes: Consumer Banking\nand Lending; Commercial Banking;\nCorporate and Investment Banking; and\nWealth and Investment Management. The\n2023 Annual Report to Shareholders\nincludes financial information and\ndescriptions of these operating\nsegments. Human Capital Our people\nare what set Wells Fargo apart and\nare critical to our success. Wells\nFargo continues to invest in our\nemployees by offering market\ncompetitive compensation, career-\ndevelopment opportunities, a broad\narray of benefits, and strong work-\nlife programs.\n                                                      \n  1We do not control this website. Wells Fargo has    \n  provided this link for your convenience, but does   \n  not endorse and is not responsible for the          \n  content, links, privacy policy, or security policy  \n  of this website.                                    \n                                                      \nWe have set common expectations for everyone at the Company. These\nexpectations guide how we lead ourselves, collaborate with our colleagues,\nand make decisions. The following expectations apply to everyone at Wells\nFargo, at every level, and in every role: \u2022 Embrace candor \u2022 Do what\u2019s right\n\u2022 Be great at execution \u2022 Learn and grow \u2022 Champion diversity and inclusion \u2022\nBuild high-performing teams (for managers) At December 31, 2023, we had\napproximately 226,000 active employees, with approximately 79% of employees\nbased in the United States. Compensation and benefits. Wells Fargo's\ncompensation program is linked to performance management and is designed to\npromote prudent risk management and reinforce its culture and operating\nstandards. The compensation principles include: \u2022 Pay for performance :\nCompensation is linked to company, line of business, and individual\nperformance, including meeting regulatory expectations and creating long-term\nvalue consistent with the interests of shareholders. \u2022 Promote effective risk\nmanagement : Compensation promotes effective risk management and discourages\nimprudent or excessive risk-taking. \u2022 Attract and retain talent : People are\none of Wells Fargo's competitive advantages; therefore, compensation helps\nattract, motivate, and retain people with the skills, talent, and experience\nto drive superior long-term company performance. In addition, we provide all\neligible full- and part-time employees (and their eligible dependents, as\napplicable) with a comprehensive set of benefits designed to protect their\nphysical, emotional, and financial health to help them make the most of their\nwell-being. Pay Equity Review. Wells Fargo is committed to fair and equitable\ncompensation practices. We have conducted an annual pay equity review through\nengagement with a third-party consultant for a number of years. The pay\nequity review compares the compensation of women to men globally and U.S.\nminorities versus U.S. non-minorities taking into account factors such as\nrole, level, tenure, and geography. We may make adjustments to compensation\nin the event the review identifies gaps. The year-end 2023 review showed that\nwomen at Wells Fargo continue to earn more than 99 cents for every $1 earned\nby their male peers, and U.S. employees that are racially/ethnically diverse\nearn more than 99 cents for every $1 earned by their Caucasian/white peers.\nPromoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Meeting the increasingly diverse\nneeds of Wells Fargo\u2019s global customer base is critical to our Company\u2019s\nlong-term growth and success. Wells Fargo values and promotes diversity,\nequity and inclusion (DE&I) in every aspect of our business. We are dedicated\nto recruitment and career development practices that support our employees\nand promote diversity throughout our workforce, including leadership\npositions. We developed DE&I principles, which are informed by affirmative\naction and equal employment opportunity policies, for our Operating\nCommittee. Our Head of\n                                      1                                      \nDiverse Segments, Representation and\nInclusion reports directly to our CEO\nand is responsible for advancing our\nDE&I efforts.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, our global\nworkforce was 51% female and 49%\nmale, and our U.S. workforce was 55%\nfemale and 45% male. Our U.S.\nworkforce was 53% Caucasian/white and\n47% racially/ethnically diverse.\n\nEmployee learning and development. We\ninvest in the development of our\nemployees and managers. We believe\nthat when our employees feel properly\nsupported, engaged, and confident in\ntheir skills, they are more effective\nand can provide an even better\ncustomer experience. During 2023, we\ninvested approximately $200 million\nin a variety of employee learning and\ndevelopment programs, including\nfunctional training, regulatory\ncompliance, leadership and\nprofessional development, and early\ntalent development programs. In\naddition, we provided tuition\nreimbursement for approximately 2,600\nemployees in 2023.\n\nWork-life programs. Wells Fargo\noffers many benefits, programs, and\nwork arrangements intended to provide\nemployees with flexibility and work-\nlife balance. For example, employees\nin certain non-customer-facing roles\nhave flexibility to work up to two\ndays a week remotely, and are\nexpected to spend a minimum of three\ndays a week in the office.\nExpectations for other roles,\nincluding customer-facing,\noperations, contact center, and\nnon-U.S. based employees, vary by\nbusiness need.\n                                                                             \n  Competition                                                                \n                                                                             \nThe financial services industry is\nhighly competitive. Our subsidiaries\ncompete with financial services\nproviders such as banks, savings and\nloan associations, credit unions,\nfinance companies, mortgage banking\ncompanies, insurance companies,\ninvestment banks and mutual fund\ncompanies. They also face increased\ncompetition from nonbank institutions\nsuch as brokerage houses, private\nequity firms and online lending\ncompanies, as well as from financial\nservices subsidiaries of commercial\nand manufacturing companies. Many of\nthese competitors enjoy fewer\nregulatory constraints and some may\nhave lower cost structures.\n\nSecurities firms and insurance\ncompanies that elect to become\nfinancial holding companies may\nacquire banks and other financial\ninstitutions. Combinations of this\ntype could significantly change the\ncompetitive environment in which we\nconduct business. The financial\nservices industry is also likely to\nbecome more competitive as further\ntechnological advances enable more\ncompanies to provide financial\nservices. These technological\nadvances may diminish the importance\nof depository institutions and other\nfinancial intermediaries in the\ntransfer of funds between parties.\n                                                                             \n   REGULATION AND SUPERVISION                                                \n                                                                             \nWe describe below, and in Note 26\n(Regulatory Capital Requirements and\nOther Restrictions) to Financial\nStatements in the 2023 Annual Report\nto Shareholders, the material\nelements of the regulatory framework\napplicable to us. Banking statutes,\nregulations and policies are\ncontinually under review by Congress\nand state legislatures and federal\nand state regulatory agencies, as\nwell as non-U.S. governments and\nfinancial regulators, and a change in\nthem, including changes in how they\nare interpreted or implemented, could\nhave a material effect on our\nbusiness. The regulatory framework\napplicable to depository institutions\nand bank holding companies (BHCs) is\nintended to protect depositors,\nfederal deposit insurance funds,\nconsumers and the\n\nbanking system as a whole, and not\nnecessarily investors in bank holding\ncompanies such as the Company.\n\nStatutes, regulations, and policies\ncould restrict our ability to\ndiversify into other areas of\nfinancial services, make\nacquisitions, and pay dividends on\nour capital stock. They may also\nrequire us to provide financial\nsupport to one or more of our\nsubsidiary banks, maintain capital\nbalances in excess of amounts desired\nby management, and pay higher deposit\ninsurance premiums as a result of\nassessments or a general\ndeterioration in the financial\ncondition of depository institutions.\nSee the \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d and\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d sections in the 2023\nAnnual Report to Shareholders for\nadditional information.\n                                                                             \n  General                                                                    \n                                                                             \nParent Bank Holding Company. As a\nBHC, the Parent is subject to\nregulation under the BHC Act and to\ninspection, examination and\nsupervision by its primary regulator,\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (Federal Reserve Board\nor FRB). The Parent is also subject\nto the disclosure and regulatory\nrequirements of the Securities Act of\n1933, as amended, and the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended,\nboth as administered by the SEC. As a\ncompany with securities listed on the\nNew York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the\nParent is subject to the rules of the\nNYSE for listed companies.\n\nSubsidiary Banks. Our subsidiary\nnational banks, and their\nsubsidiaries, are subject to\nregulation and examination primarily\nby the Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (OCC) and also by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC), the FRB, the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau (CFPB),\nthe SEC and the Commodities Futures\nTrading Commission (CFTC). The\nnon-U.S. branches and representative\noffices of our subsidiary national\nbanks are subject to regulation and\nexamination by their respective\nfinancial regulators as well as by\nthe OCC and the FRB. Non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries of our national bank\nsubsidiaries may be subject to the\nlaws and regulations of the countries\nin which they conduct business.\n\nNonbank Subsidiaries. Many of our\nnonbank subsidiaries are also subject\nto regulation by the FRB and other\napplicable federal and state\nagencies. Our insurance subsidiaries\nare subject to regulation by\napplicable state insurance regulatory\nagencies, as well as the FRB. Our\nbrokerage subsidiaries are regulated\nby the SEC, the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority (FINRA) and, in\nsome cases, the CFTC and the\nMunicipal Securities Rulemaking\nBoard, and state securities\nregulators. Our other nonbank\nsubsidiaries may be subject to the\nlaws and regulations of the federal\ngovernment and/or the various states\nas well as non-U.S. countries in\nwhich they conduct business or\noperate.\n                                                                             \n  Parent Bank Holding Company Activities                                     \n                                                                             \n\u201cFinancial in Nature\u201d Requirement. We\nbecame a financial holding company\neffective March 13, 2000. We continue\nto maintain our status as a BHC for\npurposes of various FRB regulations.\nAs a BHC that has elected to be\ntreated as a financial holding\ncompany pursuant to the BHC Act, we\nmay affiliate with securities firms\nand insurance companies and engage in\nother activities that are financial\nin nature or incidental or\ncomplementary to activities that are\nfinancial in nature. \u201cFinancial in\nnature\u201d activities include securities\nunderwriting, dealing, and market\nmaking; sponsoring mutual funds and\ninvestment companies; insurance\nunderwriting and agency; merchant\nbanking; and activities that the FRB,\nin consultation with the Secretary of\nthe U.S. Treasury, determines to be\nfinancial in nature or incidental to\nsuch financial activity.\n                                      2                                      \n\u201cComplementary activities\u201d are\nactivities that the FRB determines\nupon application to be complementary\nto a financial activity and do not\npose a safety and soundness risk.\n\nFRB approval is generally not\nrequired for us to acquire a company\n(other than a BHC, bank or savings\nassociation) engaged in activities\nthat are financial in nature or\nincidental to activities that are\nfinancial in nature, as determined by\nthe FRB. Prior notice to the FRB may\nbe required, however, if the company\nto be acquired has total consolidated\nassets of $10 billion or more. Prior\nFRB approval is required before we\nmay acquire the beneficial ownership\nor control of more than 5% of the\nvoting shares or substantially all of\nthe assets of a BHC, bank or savings\nassociation. In addition, the FRB has\nimplemented a final rule under the\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank\nAct) that also prohibits our ability\nto merge, acquire all or\nsubstantially all of the assets of,\nor acquire control of another company\nif our total resulting consolidated\nliabilities would exceed 10% of the\naggregate consolidated liabilities of\nall financial companies.\n\nBecause we are a financial holding\ncompany, if any of our subsidiary\nbanks receives a rating under the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act of 1977,\nas amended (CRA), of less than\nsatisfactory, we will be prohibited,\nuntil the rating is raised to\nsatisfactory or better, from engaging\nin new activities or acquiring\ncompanies other than BHCs, banks or\nsavings associations, except that we\ncould engage in new activities, or\nacquire companies engaged in\nactivities, that are closely related\nto banking under the BHC Act. CRA\nperformance is also considered by\nregulators in reviewing applications\nto establish bank branches. In\naddition, if the FRB finds that the\nCompany or any one of our subsidiary\nbanks is not well capitalized or well\nmanaged, we would be required to\nenter into an agreement with the FRB\nto comply with all applicable capital\nand management requirements and which\nmay contain additional limitations or\nconditions. Until corrected, we could\nbe prohibited from engaging in any\nnew activity or acquiring companies\nengaged in activities that are not\nclosely related to banking under the\nBHC Act without prior FRB approval.\nIf we fail to correct any such\ncondition within a prescribed period,\nthe FRB could order us to divest our\nbanking subsidiaries or, in the\nalternative, to cease engaging in\nactivities other than those closely\nrelated to banking under the BHC Act.\n\nInterstate Banking . Under the\nRiegle-Neal Interstate Banking and\nBranching Act (Riegle-Neal Act), a\nBHC may acquire banks in states other\nthan its home state, subject to any\nstate requirement that the bank has\nbeen organized and operating for a\nminimum period of time, not to exceed\nfive years, and the requirement that\nthe BHC not control, prior to or\nfollowing the proposed acquisition,\nmore than 10% of the total amount of\ndeposits of insured depository\ninstitutions nationwide or, unless\nthe acquisition is the bank holding\ncompany\u2019s initial entry into the\nstate, more than 30% of such deposits\nin the state (or such lesser or\ngreater amount set by the state). The\nRiegle-Neal Act also authorizes banks\nto merge across state lines, subject\nto the same deposit limits noted\nabove, thereby creating interstate\nbranches. Banks are also permitted to\nacquire and to establish new branches\nin other states.\n\nRegulatory Approval. In determining\nwhether to approve a proposed bank\nacquisition, federal banking\nregulators will consider, among other\nfactors, the effect of the\nacquisition on competition, financial\ncondition, and future prospects\nincluding current and projected\ncapital ratios and levels, the\ncompetence, experience, and integrity\nof management and record of\n\ncompliance with laws and regulations,\nthe convenience and needs of the\ncommunities to be served, including\nthe acquiring institution\u2019s record of\ncompliance under the CRA, the\neffectiveness of the acquiring\ninstitution in combating money\nlaundering activities and the risk to\nthe stability of the United States\nbanking system.\n                                                                             \n  Dividend Restrictions                                                      \n                                                                             \nThe Parent is a legal entity separate\nand distinct from its subsidiary\nbanks and other subsidiaries. A\nsignificant source of funds to pay\ndividends on our common and preferred\nstock and principal and interest on\nour debt is dividends from the\nParent\u2019s subsidiaries. Various\nfederal and state statutory\nprovisions and regulations limit the\namount of dividends the Parent\u2019s\nsubsidiary banks and certain other\nsubsidiaries may pay without\nregulatory approval. Federal banking\nregulators have the authority to\nprohibit the Parent\u2019s subsidiary\nbanks from engaging in unsafe or\nunsound practices in conducting their\nbusinesses. The payment of dividends,\ndepending on the financial condition\nof the bank in question, could be\ndeemed an unsafe or unsound practice.\nSimilarly, as part of their\nsupervisory authority, regulators may\nlimit or restrict subsidiary capital\ndistributions. The ability of the\nParent\u2019s subsidiary banks to pay\ndividends in the future is currently,\nand could be further, influenced by\nbank regulatory policies and capital\nrequirements. For information about\nthe restrictions applicable to the\nParent\u2019s subsidiary banks, see\n\nNote 26 (Regulatory Capital\nRequirements and Other Restrictions)\nto Financial Statements in the 2023\nAnnual Report to Shareholders.\n\nFurthermore, under a Support\nAgreement dated June 28, 2017, as\namended and restated on June 26, 2019\n(the \u201cSupport Agreement\u201d), among the\nParent, WFC Holdings, LLC, an\nintermediate holding company and\nsubsidiary of the Parent (the \u201cIHC\u201d),\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo\nSecurities, LLC, Wells Fargo Clearing\nServices, LLC, and certain other\nsubsidiaries of the Parent designated\nfrom time to time as material\nentities for resolution planning\npurposes or identified from time to\ntime as related support entities in\nour resolution plan, the IHC may be\nrestricted from making dividend\npayments to the Parent if certain\nliquidity and/or capital metrics fall\nbelow defined triggers, or if the\nParent\u2019s board of directors\nauthorizes it to file a case under\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Any such\nrestriction could materially and\nadversely impact the Parent\u2019s\nliquidity and its ability to satisfy\nits debt and other obligations, as\nwell as its ability to make dividend\npayments on its common and preferred\nstock. See the \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d\nand \u201cRisk Factors\u201d sections of the\n2023 Annual Report to Shareholders\nfor additional information on the\nSupport Agreement.\n\nIn addition to these restrictions on\nthe ability of our subsidiary banks\nto pay dividends to us, the FRB\nrequires large BHCs, including Wells\nFargo, to submit annual capital plans\ndescribing planned capital\ndistributions, such as the payment of\ndividends. Large BHCs, like Wells\nFargo, and their insured depository\ninstitutions also must comply with\nvarious capital requirements,\nincluding the reforms known as Basel\nIII, as well as rules that establish\nleverage and supplementary leverage\nratio requirements. We are also\nsubject to the FRB's rule\nimplementing an additional capital\nsurcharge on those U.S. banking\norganizations, such as the Company,\nthat are designated as global\nsystemically important banks\n(G-SIBs). The failure to meet any of\nthese requirements could result in\nlimitations or restrictions on our\nability to make capital\ndistributions.\n\nIn addition, the FRB\u2019s enhanced\nsupervision regulations for large\nBHCs, like Wells Fargo, impose\ncapital distribution restrictions,\nincluding on the payment of\ndividends, upon the\n                                      3                                      \noccurrence of capital, stress test,\nrisk management, or liquidity risk\nmanagement triggers. For more\ninformation on regulations or\narrangements that may impose capital\ndistribution restrictions on the\nCompany and its subsidiaries, see the\n\u201cCapital Management,\u201d \u201cRegulatory\nMatters\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d sections\nof the 2023 Annual Report to\nShareholders.\n                                                                             \n  Holding Company Structure                                                  \n                                                                             \nTransfer of Funds from Subsidiary\nBanks. The Parent\u2019s subsidiary banks\nare subject to restrictions under\nfederal law that limit the transfer\nof funds or other assets from such\nsubsidiaries to the Parent and its\nnonbank subsidiaries (including\naffiliates) in so-called \u201ccovered\ntransactions.\u201d In general, covered\ntransactions include loans and other\nextensions of credit, investments and\nasset purchases, as well as certain\nother transactions involving the\ntransfer of value from a subsidiary\nbank to an affiliate or for the\nbenefit of an affiliate. Unless an\nexemption applies, covered\ntransactions by a subsidiary bank\nwith a single affiliate are limited\nto 10% of the subsidiary bank\u2019s\ncapital and surplus and, with respect\nto all covered transactions with\naffiliates in the aggregate, to 20%\nof the subsidiary bank\u2019s capital and\nsurplus. Also, loans and extensions\nof credit to affiliates generally\nmust be secured by qualifying\ncollateral. A bank\u2019s transactions\nwith its nonbank affiliates are also\ngenerally required to be on arm\u2019s\nlength terms. The Company is also\nsubject to lending limits and\nqualitative requirements on loans to\nexecutive officers, directors and\nprincipal shareholders of the Parent\nand its subsidiary banks.\n\nSource of Strength. The FRB has a\npolicy that a BHC is expected to act\nas a source of financial and\nmanagerial strength to each of its\nsubsidiary banks and, under\nappropriate circumstances, to commit\nresources to support each such\nsubsidiary bank. This support may be\nrequired at times when the BHC may\nnot have the resources to provide the\nsupport.\n\nThe OCC may order an assessment of\nthe Parent if the capital of one of\nits national bank subsidiaries were\nto become impaired. If the Parent\nfailed to pay the assessment within\nthree months, the OCC could order the\nsale of the Parent\u2019s stock in the\nnational bank to cover the\ndeficiency.\n\nDepositor Preference. In the event of\nthe \u201cliquidation or other resolution\u201d\nof an insured depository institution,\nthe claims of deposits payable in the\nUnited States (including the claims\nof the FDIC as subrogee of insured\ndepositors) and certain claims for\nadministrative expenses of the FDIC\nas a receiver will have priority over\nother general unsecured claims\nagainst the institution. If an\ninsured depository institution fails,\nclaims of insured and uninsured U.S.\ndepositors, along with claims of the\nFDIC, will have priority in payment\nahead of unsecured creditors,\nincluding the Parent, and depositors\nwhose deposits are solely payable at\nsuch insured depository institution\u2019s\nnon-U.S. offices.\n\nLiability of Commonly Controlled\nInstitutions. The Company\u2019s\nsubsidiaries include banks in the\nU.S., such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,\nthat are insured by the FDIC. Under\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Act,\ninsured depository institutions can\nbe held liable for any loss incurred,\nor reasonably expected to be\nincurred, by the FDIC due to the\ndefault of an insured depository\ninstitution controlled by the same\nBHC, and for any assistance provided\nby the FDIC to an insured depository\ninstitution that is in danger of\ndefault and that is controlled by the\nsame BHC. \u201cDefault\u201d means generally\nthe appointment of a conservator or\nreceiver. \u201cIn danger of default\u201d\nmeans generally the existence of\ncertain conditions indicating that a\ndefault is likely to occur in the\nabsence of regulatory assistance.\n                                                                             \n  Dodd-Frank Act                                                             \n                                                                             \nThe Dodd-Frank Act and the numerous\nrules to implement its provisions\nhave resulted in enhanced regulation\nand supervision of large BHCs, such\nas Wells Fargo. This includes, among\nother things, rules to promote\nfinancial stability and prevent or\nmitigate the risks that may arise\nfrom the material distress or failure\nof a large BHC; enhance consumer\nprotections; prohibit proprietary\ntrading; and implement enhanced\nprudential requirements for large\nBHCs regarding risk-based capital and\nleverage, risk and liquidity\nmanagement, stress testing, and\nrecovery and resolution planning. The\nDodd-Frank Act, including current and\nfuture rules implementing its\nprovisions and the interpretation of\nthose rules, has affected, and we\nexpect will continue to affect, most\nof our businesses in some way, either\ndirectly through regulation of\nspecific activities or indirectly\nthrough regulation of concentration\nrisks, capital or liquidity. For more\ninformation about the Dodd-Frank Act\nand its effect on our business, see\nthe \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d sections of the 2023 Annual\nReport to Shareholders.\n\nCapital and Liquidity Requirements\nand Capital Planning\n\nThe Company and each of our insured\ndepository institutions are subject\nto various regulatory capital\nadequacy and liquidity requirements\nadministered by federal banking\nregulators. The capital rules, among\nother things, establish required\nminimum ratios relating capital to\ndifferent categories of assets and\nexposures. Federal banking regulators\nhave also imposed a leverage ratio\nand supplementary leverage ratio on\nlarge BHCs, like Wells Fargo, and\ntheir insured depository\ninstitutions, as well as a liquidity\ncoverage ratio and a net stable\nfunding ratio. The FRB has also\nfinalized rules to address the amount\nof equity and unsecured long-term\ndebt a G-SIB must hold to improve its\nresolvability and resiliency, often\nreferred to as total loss absorbing\ncapacity.\n\nFrom time to time, federal banking\nregulators propose changes and\namendments to, and issue\ninterpretations of, risk-based\ncapital requirements and related\nreporting instructions. In addition,\nthe FRB closely monitors capital\nlevels of the institutions it\nsupervises and may require such\ninstitutions to modify capital levels\nbased on FRB determinations. Such\ndeterminations, proposals or\ninterpretations could, if implemented\nin the future, affect our reported\ncapital ratios and net risk-adjusted\nassets.\n\nAs an additional means to identify\nproblems in the financial management\nof depository institutions, the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI\nAct) requires federal banking\nregulators to establish certain non-\ncapital safety and soundness\nstandards for institutions for which\nthey are the primary federal\nregulator. The standards relate\ngenerally to operations and\nmanagement, asset quality, interest\nrate exposure, executive compensation\nand risk management. Federal banking\nregulators are authorized to take\naction against institutions that fail\nto meet such standards.\n\nThe FDI Act requires federal banking\nregulators to take \u201cprompt corrective\naction\u201d with respect to FDIC-insured\ndepository institutions that do not\nmeet minimum capital requirements. A\ndepository institution\u2019s treatment\nfor purposes of the prompt corrective\naction provisions will depend upon\nhow its capital levels compare to\nvarious capital measures and certain\nother factors, as established by\nregulation.\n\nIn addition, the FRB\u2019s capital plan\nrule establishes capital planning and\nother requirements that govern\ncapital distributions, including\ndividends and share repurchases, by\ncertain BHCs, including Wells Fargo.\nFederal banking regulators also\nrequire stress tests to evaluate\nwhether an institution has\n                                      4                                      \nsufficient capital to continue to\noperate during periods of adverse\neconomic and financial conditions.\n\nFor more information on our capital\nrequirements and planning, see the\n\u201cCapital Management\u201d section of the\n2023 Annual Report to Shareholders.\n                                                                             \n  Deposit Insurance Assessments                                              \n                                                                             \nThe Company\u2019s subsidiaries include\nbanks, such as Wells Fargo Bank,\nN.A., that are insured by the FDIC.\nThrough the Deposit Insurance Fund\n(DIF) maintained by the FDIC, the\nFDIC insures the deposits of our\ninsured banks up to prescribed limits\nfor each depositor and funds the DIF\nthrough assessments on member banks.\nTo maintain the DIF, member\ninstitutions are assessed an\ninsurance premium based on an\nassessment base and an assessment\nrate.\n\nThe FDIC has adopted a comprehensive,\nlong-range plan for DIF management,\ntargeting a designated reserve ratio\nof 2%. For more information about our\nFDIC deposit assessment expense, see\nNote 21 ( Revenue and Expenses) to\nFinancial Statements in the 2023\nAnnual Report to Shareholders.\n\nThe FDIC may terminate a depository\ninstitution\u2019s deposit insurance upon\na finding that the institution\u2019s\nfinancial condition is unsafe or\nunsound or that the institution or\nits directors have engaged in unsafe\nor unsound practices or have violated\nany applicable law, regulation, order\nor condition enacted or imposed by\nthe institution\u2019s regulatory agency.\nThe termination of deposit insurance\nfor one or more of our bank\nsubsidiaries could result in a\nsignificant loss of deposits and have\na material adverse effect on our\nliquidity and earnings, depending on\nthe collective size of the particular\nbanks involved.\n                                                                             \n  Fiscal and Monetary Policies                                               \n                                                                             \nOur business and earnings are\naffected significantly by the fiscal\nand monetary policies of the federal\ngovernment and its agencies. We are\nparticularly affected by the monetary\npolicies of the FRB, which regulates\nthe supply of money and credit in the\nUnited States. Among the instruments\nof monetary policy available to the\nFRB are (a) conducting open market\noperations in United States\ngovernment securities, (b) changing\nthe discount rates of borrowings of\ndepository institutions, (c) imposing\nor changing reserve requirements\nagainst depository institutions\u2019\ndeposits, and (d) imposing or\nchanging reserve requirements against\ncertain borrowings by banks and their\naffiliates. These methods are used in\nvarying degrees and combinations to\ndirectly affect the availability of\nbank loans and deposits, as well as\nthe interest rates charged on loans\nand paid on deposits. The policies of\nthe FRB may have a material effect on\nour business, results of operations\nand financial condition.\n\nPrivacy Provisions of the Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley Act and Restrictions on\nAffiliate Marketing\n\nFederal banking regulators, as\nrequired under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley\nAct (GLB Act), have adopted rules\nlimiting the ability of banks and\nother financial institutions to\ndisclose nonpublic information about\nconsumers to nonaffiliated third\nparties. The rules require disclosure\nof privacy policies to consumers and,\nin some circumstances, allow\nconsumers to prevent disclosure of\ncertain personal information to\nnonaffiliated third parties. The\nprivacy provisions of the GLB Act\naffect how consumer information is\ntransmitted through diversified\nfinancial services companies and\nconveyed to outside vendors. Federal\nfinancial regulators have issued\nregulations under the Fair and\nAccurate Credit Transactions Act that\nhave the effect of increasing the\nlength of the waiting period, after\nprivacy disclosures are provided to\nnew customers, before information can\nbe shared\n\namong different affiliated companies\nfor the purpose of marketing products\nand services by those affiliated\ncompanies.\n                                                                             \n  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002                                                 \n                                                                             \nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\n(Sarbanes-Oxley) implemented a broad\nrange of corporate governance and\naccounting measures designed to\nincrease corporate responsibility,\nprovide for enhanced penalties for\naccounting and auditing improprieties\nat publicly traded companies, and\nprotect investors by improving the\naccuracy and reliability of\ndisclosures under federal securities\nlaws. We are subject to Sarbanes-\nOxley because we are required to file\nperiodic reports with the SEC under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nAmong other things, Sarbanes-Oxley\nand/or its implementing regulations\nestablished membership requirements\nand additional responsibilities for\nour audit committee, imposed\nrestrictions on the relationship\nbetween us and our outside auditors\n(including restrictions on the types\nof non-audit services our auditors\nmay provide to us), imposed\nadditional responsibilities for our\nexternal financial statements on our\nchief executive officer and chief\nfinancial officer, expanded the\ndisclosure requirements for our\ncorporate insiders, required our\nmanagement to evaluate our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and our\ninternal control over financial\nreporting, and required our\nindependent registered public\naccounting firm to issue a report on\nour internal control over financial\nreporting.\n                                                                             \n  USA PATRIOT Act                                                            \n                                                                             \nThe Uniting and Strengthening America\nby Providing Appropriate Tools\nRequired to Intercept and Obstruct\nTerrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT\nAct) is intended to strengthen the\nability of U.S. law enforcement\nagencies and intelligence communities\nto work together to combat terrorism\non a variety of fronts. The USA\nPATRIOT Act has significant\nimplications for depository\ninstitutions, brokers, dealers and\nother businesses involved in the\ntransfer of money. The USA PATRIOT\nAct requires the implementation of\npolicies and procedures relating to\nanti\u2011money laundering, economic\nsanctions, suspicious activities, and\ncurrency transaction reporting and\ndue diligence on customers. The USA\nPATRIOT Act also requires federal\nbanking regulators to evaluate the\neffectiveness of an applicant in\ncombating money laundering in\ndetermining whether to approve a\nproposed bank acquisition.\n                                                                             \n  Future Legislation or Regulation                                           \n                                                                             \nEconomic, market and political\nconditions during the past several\nyears have led to a significant\namount of legislation and regulation\nin the U.S. and abroad affecting the\nfinancial services industry, as well\nas heightened expectations and\nscrutiny of financial services\ncompanies from banking regulators.\nFurther legislative changes and\nadditional regulations may change our\noperating environment in substantial\nand unpredictable ways. Such\nlegislation and regulations could\nincrease our cost of doing business,\naffect our compensation structure,\nrestrict or expand the activities in\nwhich we may engage or affect the\ncompetitive balance among banks,\nsavings associations, credit unions,\nand other financial institutions. We\ncannot predict whether future\nlegislative proposals will be enacted\nand, if enacted, the effect that\nthey, or any implementing\nregulations, would have on our\nbusiness, results of operations or\nfinancial condition.\n                                      5                                      \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION Additional\ninformation in response to this Item\n1 can be found in the 2023 Annual\nReport to Shareholders under\n\u201cFinancial Review\u201d and under\n\u201cFinancial Statements.\u201d That\ninformation is incorporated into this\nitem by reference.\n                            \n  ITEM 1A.

Under the Deferred\nCompensation Plan, eligible employees\nmay defer receipt of salary, bonuses\nand certain other compensation\nsubject to the terms of the plan.\nDeferral elections are irrevocable\nonce made except for limited re-\ndeferral opportunities. We treat\namounts deferred by a participant as\nif invested in the earnings options\nselected by the participant, and\ndetermine the deferred compensation\nbenefit payable to the participant\nbased on the performance of those\nearnings options. The plan offers a\nnumber of earnings options, including\none based on our common stock with\ndividends reinvested. We generally\ndistribute amounts allocated to the\ncommon stock option in shares of\ncommon stock. Participants have no\ndirect interest in any of the\nearnings options and are general\nunsecured creditors of the Company\nwith respect to their deferred\ncompensation benefits under the plan.\nNon-Qualified Deferred Compensation\nPlan for Independent Contractors .\nUnder the Non-Qualified Deferred\nCompensation Plan for Independent\nContractors participants who\nperformed qualifying investment or\nother financial services for\nparticipating affiliates as\nindependent contractors were able to\ndefer all or part of their eligible\ncompensation payable to them by the\naffiliate subject to the terms of the\nplan. Deferral elections were\nirrevocable once made. Amounts\ndeferred by a participant were\ntreated as if invested in the\nearnings options selected by the\nparticipant, which determine the\ndeferred compensation benefit payable\nto the participant. The plan offered\na number of earnings options,\nincluding one based on our common\nstock with dividends reinvested. We\ngenerally distribute amounts\nallocated to the common stock option\nin shares of common stock. No future\ndeferrals may be made under this plan\nand participants may no longer\nreallocate their existing account\nbalances under the plan among\ndifferent investment options. Shares\nremaining available for issuance\nunder the plan consist of shares\nissuable as a result of amounts\ncredited to participant accounts\ndenominated in our common stock to\nreflect cash dividends paid on the\ncommon stock. The plan is sponsored\nby a wholly owned subsidiary, WF\nDeferred Compensation Holdings, Inc.\nWe have guaranteed its obligations\nunder the plan. Participants have no\ndirect interest in any of the\nearnings options and are general\nunsecured creditors of the plan\nsponsor and the Company with respect\nto their deferred compensation\nbenefits under the plan. Norwest\nCorporation Directors\u2019 Formula Stock\nAward Plan . Under the Norwest\nCorporation Directors\u2019 Formula Stock\nAward Plan we awarded shares of\ncommon stock to non-employee\ndirectors.
