Our Board is grateful to     \nmanagement and each of our employees who continue  \nto push forward with our transformation and        \ncreate value for our shareholders.                 \n                                                   \nAs we continue to focus on value creation, it      \nremains critical that our Board is comprised of    \nthe right mix of directors with varied             \nbackgrounds and experiences. Our current Board is  \nthe result of continuous and intentional Board     \nrefreshment over the last several years,           \nincluding the addition of three new directors at   \nour last annual shareholder meeting. At the same   \ntime, since Charlie Scharf joined the Company in   \n2019, he has built and led a leadership team that  \nwe believe brings the skills necessary to          \ncontinue developing a customer-centric culture     \nwhile effectively managing risk. Our Board         \nbelieves that the Company\u2019s senior management      \nteam is well-equipped to successfully execute our  \nstrategy and make continued progress on our        \ntransformation.                                    \n                                                   \nIn 2022, Wells Fargo continued its focus on        \nbuilding a risk and control infrastructure         \nappropriate for a company of our size and scale,   \nand this continues to be the Company\u2019s top         \npriority. We feel confident in the progress that   \nmanagement has made, and yet we believe that       \nthere is still much work to be done. The Board     \nwill continue its focus on overseeing this         \ncritical body of work. Our Board carries out its   \nrisk oversight responsibilities directly and       \nthrough specific Board committees and discusses    \nsignificant risk and regulatory matters with       \nmanagement at each of our regularly scheduled      \nBoard meetings.                                    \n                                                   \nIn addition to progressing on regulatory           \npriorities, over the last year Wells Fargo also    \ncontinued investing in its future. The Company     \nhas made progress in simplifying the business,     \nadvancing its digital and technological            \ncapabilities to meet the evolving needs of         \ncustomers, and executing on its efficiency         \ninitiatives.

In particular, forward-looking            \nstatements include, but are not limited to,        \nstatements we make about our expectations for our  \noperations and business and our corporate          \nresponsibility progress, plans, and goals          \n(including environmental and human capital         \nmatters). Forward-looking statements are not       \nbased on historical facts, but instead represent   \nour current expectations and assumptions           \nregarding our business, the economy, and other     \nfuture conditions. The inclusion of such           \nstatements is not an indication that these         \ncontents are necessarily material to investors or  \nrequired to be disclosed in the Company\u2019s filings  \nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission.       \nBecause forward-looking statements relate to the   \nfuture, they are subject to inherent               \nuncertainties, risks, and changes in               \ncircumstances that are difficult to predict.       \nActual results may differ materially from our      \nforward-looking statements due to several          \nfactors. Factors that could cause our actual       \nresults to differ materially from our forward-     \nlooking statements are described in our Annual     \nReport on Form 10-Kfor the year ended December     \n31, 2022. We caution you, therefore, against       \nrelying on any of these forward-looking            \nstatements. They are neither statements of         \nhistorical fact nor guarantees or assurances of    \nfuture performance. Any forward-looking statement  \nmade by us speaks only as of the date on which it  \nis made. Factors or events that could cause our    \nactual results to differ may emerge from time to   \ntime, and it is not possible for us to predict     \nall of them. We undertake no obligation to         \npublicly update any forward-looking statement,     \nwhether as a result of new information, future     \ndevelopments, or otherwise, and notwithstanding    \nany historical practice of doing so, except as     \nmay be required by law. In addition, historical,   \ncurrent, and forward-looking sustainability-       \nrelated statements may be based on standards for   \nmeasuring progress that are still developing,      \ninternal controls and processes that continue to   \nevolve, and assumptions that are subject to        \nchange in the future.

We describe     \nthese objectives as our executive compensation     \nprinciples, each of which is an essential          \ncomponent to drive strong, risk-managed            \nperformance. Our approach to variable              \ncompensation, the framework and goals that the     \nHuman Resources Committee (\u201c HRC\u201d) considered in   \nits decision process, and our executive            \ncompensation policies and practices are unchanged  \nfrom last year. The design of our 2023 executive   \ncompensation program remains the same, except      \nthat the HRC increased the absolute return on      \ntangible common equity (\u201c ROTCE\u201d) requirement to   \nearn awards at or above target.

Other Highlights The Board and          \nmanagement engaged with our shareholders           \nthroughout the year, which provided shareholders   \nthe opportunity to provide direct feedback. In     \nresponse to shareholder feedback, we enhanced our  \ndisclosure in three key areas: (1) CEO and NEO     \nbase salary levels; (2) peer group selection; and  \n(3) HRC\u2019s approach to compensation decisions. Our  \nexecutive compensation program is designed to      \nalign with our business, performance, risk, and    \ntalent needs and reinforce our pay-for-            \nperformance compensation philosophy. We adhere to  \nwidely recognized compensation best practices      \ndescribed throughout the Compensation Discussion   \nand Analysissection of this proxy statement, and   \nsummarized below:                                  \n                                                   \n                  What We Do                       \n                                   \u2022\u2002\u2009Strong and   \n  \u2022 Incentive                      independent     \n  compensation                     Board           \n  is variable                      oversight       \n  and                              through the     \n  \u201cat-risk\u201d and                    Board\u2019s HRC \u00a0   \n  equity                           \u2022\u2002\u2009Clawback     \n  compensation                     and Forfeiture  \n  covers                           Policy          \n  multi-year                       provides for    \n  vesting                          recoupment and  \n  periods \u2022                        forfeiture of   \n  Focus on                         compensation    \n  executive                        in appropriate  \n  officer risk                     circumstances   \n  management and                   \u2022\u2002\u2009Stock        \n  risk outcomes                    Ownership       \n  \u2022 Overall                        Policy          \n  performance                      includes        \n  evaluated                        minimum         \n  through a                        ownership       \n  rigorous                         requirements \u00a0  \n  performance                      \u2022\u2002\u2009Year-round   \n  assessment                       engagement      \n  framework \u2022                      with            \n  Engage                           shareholders    \n  independent                      on executive    \n  compensation                     compensation    \n  consultant                       and governance  \n                                   issues          \n                  What We Do Not                   \n                  Do                               \n  \u2022 No cash                                        \n  dividends on                                     \n  unearned                                         \n  restricted                                       \n  share rights                                     \n  (\u201cRSRs\u201d) and                                     \n  performance                                      \n  share awards                                     \n  (\u201cPSAs\u201d) \u2022 No                                    \n  pledging of                      \u2022\u2002\u2009No           \n  Company                          repricing of    \n  securities by                    stock options   \n  directors or                     without         \n  executive                        shareholder     \n  officers under                   approval \u00a0 \u2022\u2002\u2009  \n  the Board\u2019s                      No hedging of   \n  Corporate                        Company         \n  Governance                       securities by   \n  Guidelines \u2022                     directors,      \n  No executive                     executive       \n  employment                       officers, or    \n  agreements \u2022                     other           \n  No tax                           employees       \n  gross-ups for                    under our Code  \n  NEOs \u2022                           of Ethics and   \n  No additional                    Business        \n  retirement                       Conduct (\u201cCode  \n  benefits or                      of Conduct\u201d)    \n  additional                       \u2022\u2002\u2009Limited      \n  years of                         perquisites     \n  credited                         for executive   \n  service                          officers        \n  other than                                       \n  investment or                                    \n  interest                                         \n  credits                                          \n  provided under                                   \n  applicable                                       \n  pension plans                                    \n  since July 1,                                    \n  2009                                             \n                                                   \n                             \n  v    2023 Proxy Statement  \n                             \nLeadership, Strategy, and Business Leadership Our  \nBoard continues its focus on overseeing            \nmanagement\u2019s efforts to execute on our Company\u2019s   \nstrategy and continue building an appropriate      \nrisk and control infrastructure.

Each year, our Board       \naffirmatively determines the independence of each  \ndirector and each nominee for election as a        \ndirector. Under New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)     \nrules, in order for a director to be considered    \nindependent, our Board must determine that the     \ndirector has no material relationship with our     \nCompany (either directly or as a partner,          \nshareholder, or officer of an organization that    \nhas a relationship with our Company). To assist    \nour Board in making its independence               \ndeterminations, our Board adopted the Director     \nIndependence Standards appended to our Corporate   \nGovernance Guidelines. These Director              \nIndependence Standards consist of the NYSE\u2019s       \n\u201cbright line\u201d standards of independence, as well   \nas additional standards, known as categorical      \nstandards of independence, adopted by our Board.   \nThe Director Independence Standards are available  \non our website at: https://www.wellsfargo.com/abo  \nut/corporate/governance. Based on the Director     \nIndependence Standards, our Board considered       \ninformation in early 2023 regarding banking and    \nfinancial services, commercial, charitable,        \nfamilial, and other relationships between each     \ndirector and director nominee, his or her          \nrespective immediate family members, and/or        \ncertain entities affiliated with such directors,   \ndirector nominees, and immediate family members,   \non the one hand, and our Company, on the other,    \nto determine the director\u2019s or director nominee\u2019s  \nindependence. After reviewing the information      \npresented to it and considering the                \nrecommendation of the GNC, our Board determined    \nthat, except for Charles W. Scharf, who is a       \nWells Fargo employee, all other current directors  \nand director nominees are independent under the    \nDirector Independence Standards: Steven D. Black,  \nMark A. Chancy, Celeste A. Clark, Theodore F.      \nCraver, Jr., Richard K. Davis, Wayne M. Hewett,    \nCeCelia \u201cCeCe\u201d G. Morken, Maria R. Morris,         \nFelicia F. Norwood, Richard B. Payne, Jr., Juan    \nA. Pujadas, Ronald L. Sargent, and Suzanne M.      \nVautrinot. In connection with making its           \nindependence determinations, our Board considered  \nthe following relationships, as well as the        \nrelationships with a director described under the  \nRelated Person Transactionssection of this proxy   \nstatement, under the Director Independence         \nStandards and determined that all of these         \nrelationships satisfied the NYSE \u201cbright line\u201d     \nstandards of independence and were immaterial      \nunder our Board\u2019s categorical standards of         \nindependence:                                      \n                                                   \n                           Our Company\u2019s banking   \n                           and other subsidiaries  \n                           had ordinary course     \n                           banking and financial   \n                           services relationships  \n                           in 2022 with certain    \n                           of our directors, some  \n                           of their immediate      \n                           family members, and/or  \n                           certain entities        \n  Banking and Financial    affiliated with such    \n  Services                 directors and their     \n  Relationships            immediate family        \n                           members, all of which   \n                           were on substantially   \n                           the same terms as       \n                           those available at the  \n                           time for comparable     \n                           transactions with       \n                           persons not affiliated  \n                           with our Company and    \n                           complied with           \n                           applicable banking      \n                           laws.                   \n                           The spouse of a         \n                           sibling of Wayne M.     \n                           Hewett is affiliated    \n                           with an entity which    \n                           has ordinary course     \n                           business relationships  \n  Business                 with the Company.

As described in the Corporate            \nGovernance Guidelines and the GNC\u2019s charter, the   \nGNC will consider, in identifying or evaluating    \nfirst-time candidates or nominees for director,    \nthe current composition of our Board and the       \ninterplay of the candidate\u2019s or nominee\u2019s          \nexperience, education, skills, background,         \ngender, race, ethnicity, and other qualities and   \nattributes with those of the other Board members.  \nThe GNC believes that it has been successful in    \nits efforts over the years to promote gender,      \nrace, and ethnic diversity on our Board. Our       \nBoard believes that our director nominees for      \nelection at our 2023 annual meeting bring to our   \nBoard a variety of different backgrounds, skills,  \nprofessional and industry experience, and other    \npersonal qualities, attributes, and perspectives   \nthat contribute to the overall diversity of our    \nBoard. The Board expects to maintain its focus on  \nBoard diversity as well as other desired           \nqualifications and experience identified by the    \nBoard in future director recruitment efforts. The  \nGNC and our Board will continue to monitor the     \neffectiveness of their practices in any new        \ndirector search efforts, and in their annual       \nself-evaluation process.

Process  \nDirector Election Standard Our By-Lawsprovide      \nthat directors will be elected using a majority    \nvote standard in an uncontested director election  \n(i.e., an election where, as of the record date,   \nthe only nominees are those nominated by our       \nBoard). Under this standard, a nominee for         \ndirector will be elected to our Board if the       \nvotes cast for the nominee exceed the votes cast   \nagainst the nominee. In a contested election,      \nhowever, directors will be elected by a plurality  \nof the votes cast. Under Delaware law, directors   \ncontinue in office until their successors are      \nelected and qualified or until their earlier       \nresignation or removal. Our Corporate Governance   \nGuidelines provide that our Board will nominate    \nfor election and appoint to fill Board vacancies   \nor newly created directorships only those          \ndirectors who have tendered or agreed to tender    \nan irrevocable resignation that would              \n                              \n  2023 Proxy Statement    23  \n                              \nCorporate Governance become effective upon their   \nfailure to receive the required vote for election  \nand Board acceptance of the tendered resignation.  \nEach director nominee named in this proxy statement\nhas tendered an irrevocable resignation as a       \ndirector in accordance with our Corporate          \nGovernance Guidelines, which resignation will      \nbecome effective if he or she fails to receive the \nrequired vote for election at the annual meeting   \nand our Board accepts his or her resignation. Our  \nCorporate Governance Guidelines also provide that  \nthe GNC will consider the tendered resignation of a\ndirector who fails to receive the required number  \nof votes for election, as well as any other offer  \nto resign that is conditioned upon Board           \nacceptance, and recommend to our Board whether or  \nnot to accept such resignation. The director whose \nresignation is under consideration will abstain    \nfrom participating in any decision of the GNC or   \nour Board regarding such resignation. If our Board \ndoes not accept the resignation, the director will \ncontinue to serve until his or her successor is    \nelected and qualified. Our Board will publicly     \ndisclose its decision on tendered resignations     \nwithin 90 days after certification of the          \nshareholder voting results. Director Nomination    \nProcess The GNC is responsible for leading the     \ndirector nomination process, which includes        \nidentifying, evaluating, and recommending for      \nnomination candidates for election as directors,   \nregardless of who nominates a candidate for        \nconsideration. The goal of the GNC\u2019s nominating    \nprocess is to assist our Board in attracting and   \nretaining competent individuals with the requisite \nleadership, executive management, financial,       \nindustry, and other expertise and who will act as  \ndirectors in the best interests of our Company and \nits shareholders.                                  \n                               \n  24    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nCorporate Governance                               \n                                                   \nDirector Re-NominationProcess As discussed under   \nthe Comprehensive Annual Evaluation of Board       \nEffectivenesssection of this proxy statement, the  \nGNC considers the results of the Board\u2019s annual    \nself-evaluation, including the individual          \ncontributions of directors to the work of the      \nBoard and its Committees, in connection with its   \ndetermination to nominate existing directors for   \nreelection at each annual meeting of               \nshareholders.

                                   \nCommittees of Our Board Our Board has six          \nstanding Committees that act on behalf of the      \nBoard and report on their activities to the

delegate, in its       \ndiscretion, all or a portion of its authority to   \nsubcommittees of one or more of its members. In    \n2022, there were two subcommittees of the Risk     \nCommittee: the Credit Subcommittee and the         \nTechnology Subcommittee. Effective January 2023,   \nthe Technology Subcommittee has been reintegrated  \ninto the Risk Committee. The Board appoints the    \nmembers and Chair of each Committee based on the   \nrecommendation of the GNC. As part of this         \nprocess, the GNC reviews the committee structure,  \ncommittee assignments, and chair positions         \nannually and recommends to the Board the           \nassignment of Board members to various             \ncommittees. Also annually, the GNC reviews         \nwhether rotation of the Committee Chair is         \ndesirable due to the length of a director\u2019s        \nservice as Chair, best practices with respect to   \ncommittee refreshment or committee chair           \nrotation, or other reasons. The GNC also reviews   \nthe directors\u2019 qualifications and experience       \nmatrix for each Board committee as it evaluates    \nthe collective experience of nominees on each      \nCommittee in light of the particular committee\u2019s   \noversight responsibilities. The collective         \nqualifications and experience of nominees on each  \ncommittee are reflected below under the Board      \nCommittee Composition and Oversight                \nResponsibilitiessection of this proxy statement.   \nOur Committees\u2019 charters are available on our      \nwebsite at: https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/corp  \norate/governance/. As required by its charter,     \neach Committee annually reviews and assesses its   \ncharter\u2019s adequacy, reviews its performance, and   \nis responsible for overseeing reputation risk      \nrelated to its responsibilities. In addition, the  \nAudit Committee convenes one joint meeting with    \nthe Risk Committee annually and holds quarterly    \njoint meetings with the Credit Subcommittee.

Each Board Committee is            \nresponsible for overseeing risks within its        \npurview. All Board Committees, which are           \ncomprised solely of independent directors, report  \nto the full Board about their activities,          \nincluding risk oversight-related matters. Each     \nBoard Committee has defined authority and          \nresponsibilities for primary oversight of          \nspecific risks, as outlined in its respective      \ncharter, and works closely with management to      \nunderstand and oversee our Company\u2019s key risk      \nexposures. Each Board Committee may delegate       \ncertain of its oversight responsibilities to a     \nsubcommittee to assist in its duties. In addition  \nto the risk oversight structure at the parent      \nlevel, the board of directors of the Company\u2019s     \nprincipal banking subsidiary, WFBNA, has           \nestablished the RCOC. The RCOCoversees compliance  \nwith certain regulatory consent orders and other   \nenforcement actions for which oversight has been   \ndelegated by either the Board or the WFBNA Board.  \n

The Company has 14 Group       \nIncentive Compensation and Performance Management  \nSteering Committees (\u201cGroup IPCs\u201d). The Group      \nIPCs are steering committees established by the    \nIPC and are aligned with each of the Company\u2019s     \nlines of business and enterprise functions. Group  \nIPCs are co-chairedby the business Operating       \nCommittee member and compensation leader. The      \nGroup IPCs oversee, govern, and make informed      \nrecommendations or decisions, as applicable,       \nabout business-aligned efforts related to          \nincentive compensation and performance             \nmanagement, with a critical focus on material      \nrisk failures, for applicable employees and        \npractices within their authority and in            \naccordance with our Risk Management Framework.     \nOur Company continues to be committed to           \ndesigning and implementing performance management  \nand compensation programs that are balanced,       \npromote risk management, and discourage imprudent  \nor excessive risk-taking. Through our ICRM         \nPolicy, we develop, execute, and administer our    \nincentive compensation plans, which are designed   \nto balance risk and financial reward in a manner   \nthat supports our customers, shareholders,         \nemployees, and the Company. Performance            \nmanagementis a key facet of how we align our       \nculture and Company expectations for our           \nemployees. Performance goals for employees are     \nset in support of enterprise strategy, business    \ngoals, and their roles and responsibilities        \nthough the lens of risk management. Performance    \ngoals for employees and management whose roles     \ninvolve promotion or sales activity are designed   \nto discourage excessive or inappropriate risk-     \ntaking and are subject to additional oversight.    \n                                                   \n       Sales objectives must be balanced with      \n       non-sales considerations, including         \n       behavioral expectations and risk            \n  \u2022    management, and elements of quality and     \n       customer experience, such as customer       \n       retention and long-term relationship        \n       building.                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       Sales objectives must be reasonable,        \n       measurable, and attainable within a         \n       defined timeframe, and not in conflict      \n  \u2022    with serving the customers\u2019 needs.

The Board has     \nassigned to the HRC the responsibility to oversee  \nthe Company\u2019s talent management and succession     \nplanning process, including the CEO evaluation and \nsuccession planning. The CEO and management        \nannually report to the HRC and the Board on        \nsuccession planning (including plans in the event  \nof an emergency) and management development, and   \nprovide the HRC and the Board with an assessment of\npersons considered potential successors to certain \nsenior management positions. The Board engages in  \nan annual succession planning process through which\nit identifies potential management successors. Our \ntalent review process for senior management roles  \nalso includes diverse talent reviews for business  \nand enterprise function groups across the Company. \nAs part of talent and succession planning, the     \nBoard uses defined attributes for the qualities the\nBoard seeks in the CEO and other senior leaders.   \nThe HRC and the Board annually assess and update,  \nas appropriate, those attributes as part of our    \nsuccession planning process.                       \n                              \n  2023 Proxy Statement    35  \n                              \nCorporate Governance Comprehensive Annual          \nEvaluation of Board Effectiveness Each year, our   \nBoard conducts a comprehensive self-evaluation in  \norder to assess its own effectiveness, review our  \ngovernance practices, and identify areas for       \nenhancement. Our Board\u2019s annual self-evaluation    \nalso is a key component of its director nomination \nprocess and succession planning. The GNC, in       \nconsultation with our independent Chair, reviews   \nand determines the overall process, scope, and     \ncontent of our Board\u2019s annual self-evaluation      \nprocess. The GNC has continued to enhance the      \nBoard\u2019s self-evaluation process based on director  \nfeedback, best practices, experience, and          \nregulatory expectations. As provided in their      \nrespective charters, each of our Board\u2019s standing  \nCommittees also conducts a self-evaluation process \nannually. Our Board\u2019s and each Committee\u2019s self-   \nevaluation includes a review of the Corporate      \nGovernance Guidelines and its Committee charter,   \nrespectively, to consider any proposed changes.    \nEach year, the GNC considers whether to engage a   \nthird party to assist the Board in conducting its  \nself-evaluation. In each of 2022, 2021, 2020, 2018,\nand 2017, the Board engaged a third party to       \nfacilitate its annual self-evaluation. The process \nfor 2022 included individual interviews with each  \nof the directors and discussions of the results of \nthe Board and Committee self-evaluations with both \nthe GNC and the Board.

retirements, our commitment  \nto Board diversity, and recruiting strategies for  \nnew directors. The GNC and our Board consider a    \nnumber of factors in evaluating the Board\u2019s        \ncomposition, as indicated below, along with other  \nfactors the Board deems appropriate. Board         \nSuccession Planning Framework Our Board conducts   \nformal succession planning annually and has        \nadopted a Board Succession Planning Framework to   \nassist the Board in this process. Key factors      \nconsidered in this annual evaluation are           \ndiscussed in the table below.                      \n                                                   \n  Factor          What

                 \n  age of 72 for directors with the understanding   \n  that directors may not necessarily serve until   \n  their retirement age. Our Board\u2019s retirement     \n  age                                              \n  policy is intended to facilitate our Board\u2019s     \n  recruitment of new directors with appropriate    \n  skills, experience, and backgrounds and provide  \n  for an orderly transition of leadership on our   \n  Board and its Committees. The Board may,         \n  however,                                         \n  approve the nomination of such individual if,    \n  due                                              \n  to special or unique circumstances, the Board    \n  determines that it is in the best interest of    \n  our                                              \n  Company and shareholders for the individual to   \n  be                                               \n  nominated for election.                          \n                                                   \nDirector Orientation Process and Continuing        \nEducation New Director Orientation All new         \ndirectors receive an orientation to the Company.   \nIn part based on the feedback of our existing      \ndirectors and guided by the needs and desires of   \nour new directors, the orientation program         \nincludes presentations by senior management on     \nour strategic plan, significant financial,         \naccounting, and risk management policies and       \nissues, compliance programs and policies           \n(including our Code of Conduct), and business      \nreviews by the heads of our lines of business and  \nmeetings with Risk, Human Resources, Legal and     \nFinance, and our internal and independent          \nauditors. New directors also learn about our       \nsignificant risks, regulatory matters, and         \ncorporate governance matters, including the roles  \nand responsibilities of our directors.             \nAdditionally, in response to director feedback,    \nwe enhanced the new director orientation program   \nto include DE&I and ESG segments. Ongoing          \nDirector Training The Board and its Committees     \nparticipate in, and receive, various forms of      \ntraining and education throughout the year, such   \nas business reviews, including related to DE&I;    \nmanagement presentations on the Company\u2019s          \nbusinesses, services, and products; and            \ninformation on industry trends, regulatory         \ndevelopments, best practices, and emerging risks   \nin the financial services industry. Other          \neducational and reference materials on             \ngovernance, regulatory, risk, and other relevant   \ntopics are regularly included in Board and         \nCommittee meeting materials and maintained in an   \nelectronic library available to directors.         \nTraining topics are generally identified either    \nthrough director or executive feedback or in       \nconnection with events relevant to the Company,    \nincluding areas of emerging risk. Continuing       \nDirector Education We also encourage our           \ndirectors to attend outside director and other     \ncontinuing education programs and make available   \nto directors information on director education     \nprograms that might be of interest on              \ndevelopments in our industry, corporate            \ngovernance, regulatory requirements and            \nexpectations, the economic environment, or other   \nmatters relevant to their duties as a director of  \nour Company. We reimburse directors for expenses   \nincurred for these programs.                       \n                               \n  40    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nCorporate Governance                               \n                                                   \nStructure of Our Director Compensation Program     \n2022 Cash Compensation The following table shows   \nthe cash components of our non-employeedirector    \ncompensation program.

Effective  \n  (1)    January\u00a01, 2023, we began paying the      \n         independent Chair annual retainer         \n         entirely in Company common stock and      \n         requiring deferral of that retainer       \n         until the Chair leaves the Board, or      \n         later, if elected.                        \n                                                   \n                                                   \n         Includes standing Committee/subcommittee  \n         meetings, as well as special purpose      \n  (2)    committee meetings not held concurrently  \n         with or immediately prior to or           \n         following a Company Board or              \n         Committee/subcommittee meeting.           \n                                                   \n                                                   \n  (3)    $2,000 per meeting in excess of 12        \n         meetings.                                 \n                                                   \nDirectors of WFBNA received an additional $10,000  \nannual cash retainer. Effective April 1, 2022,     \nthe chair of the WFBNA Board also began receiving  \nan annual fee of $25,000, payable quarterly in     \narrears. The RCOC chair also received a total      \nchair fee of $13,750 (the chair\u2019s annual fee       \ndecreased effective April 1, 2022, from $25,000    \nto $10,000). 2022 Equity Compensation For 2022,    \neach non-employeedirector elected to our Board at  \nour Company\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders       \nreceived on that date an award of Company common   \nstock having a value of $240,000. The dollar       \nvalue of each stock award was converted to a       \nnumber of shares of Company common stock using     \nthe closing price on the grant date, rounded up    \nto the nearest whole share. Effective January 1,   \n2023, we began paying the annual equity award in   \nthe form of RSRs and requiring deferral of all     \nsuch RSRs until a director leaves the Board, or    \nlater, at the election of the director. Deferral   \nProgram For 2022, non-employeedirectors were able  \nto defer all or part of their cash compensation    \nand equity awards. Cash compensation could be      \ndeferred into either an interest-bearing account   \nor common stock units with dividends reinvested.   \nThe interest rate paid in 2022 on interest-        \nbearing accounts was 1.45%. Equity awards could    \nbe deferred only into common stock units with      \ndividends reinvested. Deferred amounts are paid    \neither in a lump sum or installments, as elected   \nby the director. Stock Ownership Policy Each non-  \nemployeedirector, within five years after joining  \nour Board, must hold shares of our common stock    \nhaving a value equal to five times the annual      \ncash retainer and maintain at least that           \nownership level while a member of our Board and    \nfor one year after service as a director ends.     \nHolding deferred shares counts towards a non-      \nemployeedirector\u2019s ownership level, regardless of  \nwhether the award(s) underlying the deferred       \nshares have vested. Each director who has been on  \nour Board for five years or more exceeded this     \nownership level as of December 31, 2022, and each  \ndirector who has served less than five years is    \non track to meet this ownership level.             \n                              \n  2023 Proxy Statement    41  \n                              \nCorporate Governance                               \n                                                   \nGNC Use of Compensation Consultant The GNC         \nannually reviews our director compensation         \nprogram and periodically recommends changes to     \nthe program for our Board to approve. The GNC\u2019s    \nreview and recommendation, if any, considers our   \ndirector pay philosophy, relevant market           \npractices, and consultation with Meridian          \nCompensation Partners (\u201c Meridian\u201d), the GNC\u2019s     \nindependent compensation consultant. The GNC\u2019s     \nreview did not result in any new changes to our    \ndirector compensation program for 2023. Director   \nCompensation Limit As approved by our              \nshareholders at the Company\u2019s 2022 annual meeting  \nof shareholders, our equity incentive plan         \ncontains an upper limit of the total compensation  \nthat a non-employeedirector may receive annually.  \nSpecifically, the total annual compensation paid   \nto any non-employeedirector, inclusive of cash     \ncompensation and amounts awarded under the         \nCompany\u2019s 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan, shall     \nnot exceed $750,000, except that in the case of    \nthe Chair of the Board or any Independent Lead     \nDirector, such limit is instead $1,500,000.        \nDirector Compensation The table below provides     \ninformation on 2022 compensation for our non-      \nemployeedirectors. Our Company reimburses          \ndirectors for expenses incurred in their Board     \nservice, including the cost of attending Board     \nand Committee meetings. 2022 Director              \nCompensation Table                                 \n                                                   \n                                \u2026                  \n                                \u2026                  \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n                         \u2026      \u2026                  \n                                \u2026                  \n                                \u2026                  \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n         Includes fees earned, whether paid in     \n         cash or deferred, for service on our      \n         Company\u2019s Board in 2022, as described     \n         under the 2022 Cash Compensation section  \n         of this proxy statement.

The GNC          \nannually reviews all ongoing Interested            \nTransactions.                                      \n                              \n  2023 Proxy Statement    45  \n                              \nOwnership of Our Common Stock Directors and        \nExecutive Officers Stock Ownership Requirements    \nand Other Policies Stock Ownership Requirements    \nTo reinforce the long-term perspective of stock-   \nbased compensation and emphasize the relationship  \nbetween the interests of our directors and         \nexecutive officers with your interests as          \nshareholders, we require our non-                  \nemployeedirectors and our executive officers to    \nown shares of our common stock.

Anti-Hedging         \nPolicies To further strengthen the alignment       \nbetween stock ownership and your interests as      \nshareholders, our Code of Conduct requirements     \nprohibit all employees, including our executive    \nofficers and directors, from engaging in           \nderivative or hedging transactions involving any   \nCompany securities, including our common stock.    \nThis hedging prohibition with respect to Company   \nsecurities applies to any type of transaction in   \nsecurities that limits investment risk with the    \nuse of derivatives, such as options, puts, calls,  \nfutures contracts, or other similar instruments.   \nNo Pledging Policy Our Board has adopted policies  \nwhich are reflected in our Corporate Governance    \nGuidelines that prohibit our directors and         \nexecutive officers from pledging Company equity    \nsecurities as collateral for margin or other       \nsimilar loan transactions. Delinquent Section      \n16(a) Reports Section 16(a) of the Securities      \nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our     \ndirectors, executive officers, and beneficial      \nowners of more than 10% of our common stock to     \nfile initial reports of ownership and changes in   \nownership of our common stock and other equity     \nsecurities with the SEC. SEC regulations also      \nrequire us to identify in this proxy statement     \nany person subject to this requirement who failed  \nto file any such report on a timely basis. To our  \nknowledge, based solely on a review of the filed   \nreports and written representations by the         \npersons required to file these reports, we         \nbelieve that each of our directors and executive   \nofficers complied with all such filing             \nrequirements during 2022, except that, due to an   \nadministrative error, the January 1, 2018 Form 3   \nfiling for Theodore F. Craver, Jr. inadvertently   \nmisstated his initial holdings on becoming         \nsubject to Section 16(a). An amended Form 3 was    \nfiled on behalf of Mr. Craver on January 24, 2023  \npromptly after the error was discovered.           \n                               \n  46    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nOwnership of Our Common Stock                      \n                                                   \nDirector and Executive Officer Stock Ownership     \nTable The following table shows how many shares    \nof common stock our current directors and          \nnominees for director, our NEOs, and all           \ndirectors, director nominees, and executive        \nofficers, as a group, beneficially owned on        \nFebruary 22, 2023, and the number of shares they   \nhad the right to acquire within 60 days of that    \ndate, including RSRs that are scheduled to vest    \nwithin 60 days of that date.

Our         \ncompensation principles and philosophy are         \ndesigned to incentivize and hold our NEOs          \naccountable for sustaining strong financial and    \nnon-financialresults that are important to our     \nstakeholders. The majority of the total            \ncompensation provided to the CEO and other NEOs    \nis at risk, and delivered primarily in the form    \nof long-term equity, including performance share   \nawards (PSAs) and restricted share rights (RSRs)   \nthat are subject to ongoing risk and service       \nconditions, and for PSAs, achieving pre-           \ndeterminedthree-year financial performance goals.  \nDuring 2021, the HRC made significant              \nenhancements to our executive compensation         \nprogram through active engagement with             \nshareholders. These enhancements became effective  \nfor and reflected in the design and disclosure of  \nour 2021 executive compensation program and        \nremained in place for 2022.

increased from 57% approval in 2021    \nto 73% approval in 2022. In 2022, we continued to  \nactively engage with shareholders on our           \nexecutive compensation program, as well as other   \nmatters. Shareholders broadly reaffirmed their     \nsupport for the design of our executive            \ncompensation program, including the changes        \nimplemented in the prior year. For 2022, based on  \nshareholder feedback and following a thorough      \nreview of our executive compensation program and   \npeer practices, the HRC determined not to make     \nsignificant structural changes to our executive    \ncompensation program. The HRC also determined      \nthat it was important to continue to enhance       \ndisclosure of our executive compensation program.  \nFor 2022, the HRC made compensation                \ndeterminations for the CEO and other NEOs that     \nreinforce the alignment of executive pay with      \nperformance and long-term shareholder interests.   \n                               \n  54    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nExecutive Compensation                             \n                                                   \nGiven the feedback received during the 2022        \nshareholder engagement sessions, we provide        \nfurther details regarding three key questions      \nraised by shareholders, as discussed under 2022    \nSay on Pay Vote and Shareholder Engagement.        \nPlease also refer to additional details in later   \nsections of this Compensation Discussion and       \nAnalysis (\u201c CD&A\u201d). 2022 Performance Highlights    \nDuring 2022, the Company delivered strong          \nunderlying performance despite the challenging     \nmacro environment. While our financial             \nperformance was meaningfully impacted by           \noperating losses, our underlying financial         \nperformance was strong and reflected the progress  \nwe are making to improve returns. Rising interest  \nrates drove strong net interest income growth,     \ncredit losses continued to increase slowly, but    \ncredit quality remained strong, and we continued   \nto make progress on our efficiency initiatives.    \nWe also continued to invest in our strategic       \ncapabilities, developing innovative products and   \nsolutions to better serve our customers. These     \nincluded rolling out our new consumer mobile app,  \nrelaunching Intuitive Investor \u00ae, introducing two  \nnew credit cards, and launching a new digital      \nbanking platform for our commercial clients. We    \nmade changes in 2022 that helped millions of       \ncustomers avoid overdraft fees. We have also       \ncontinued to invest in strengthening our risk and  \ncontrol infrastructure. A significant portion of   \nthe operating losses incurred in 2022 reflected a  \nDecember settlement we reached with the Consumer   \nFinancial Protection Bureau (\u201c CFPB\u201d), which       \nresolved multiple historical issues, many of       \nwhich have been outstanding for several years.     \nOver the past three years, we have made            \nsignificant changes to address the matters         \nreferenced in the settlement, and many of the      \nrequired actions were already substantially        \ncomplete. This settlement followed the             \ntermination or expiration of several consent       \norders since 2020 as the Company continues to      \nfocus on strengthening its risk and control        \ninfrastructure and delivering on its regulatory    \ncommitments. In addition to the operating losses   \ndescribed above, we also experienced changes in    \nthe allowance for credit losses, excluding net     \ncharge-offs, from 2021 to 2022, as well as the     \nimpact from divestitures in 2021. To better        \nassess the underlying financial performance of     \nthe Company and compare year-over-year results,    \nthe HRC concluded that it was important to review  \nfinancial performance on an as-reported and        \nadjusted basis to take into account the impact of  \nthe notable items described below. Please refer    \nto 2022 Company Performancefor more details about  \nthe Company\u2019s financial performance and how it     \nwas considered in the HRC\u2019s 2022 compensation      \ndecisions for the NEOs. The financial performance  \nmetrics featured in the charts below summarize     \nselect 2022 and 2021 financial results, which      \nalong with our non-financial results, were among   \nthe key inputs considered in the HRC\u2019s             \nperformance assessment. In addition, the HRC       \nbelieved it was useful to consider adjustments     \nfor notable items that occurred during 2022 and    \n2021 to better assess the Company\u2019s underlying     \nfinancial performance for 2022, including as       \ncompared with 2021. The financial performance      \nmetrics featured in the tables below have been     \nadjusted for the following notable items. 2022     \nNotable Items                                      \n                                                   \n       Operating losses: litigation, regulatory,   \n       and customer remediation matters related    \n  \u2022    to a variety of historical matters of $2.0  \n       billion (pre-tax) and $3.3 billion          \n       (pre-tax) in the third and fourth quarters  \n       of 2022, respectively                       \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       Change in allowance for credit losses:      \n  \u2022    decrease of $75 million, excluding the      \n       impact of net charge-offs                   \n                                                   \n2021 Notable Items                                 \n                                                   \n       Change in allowance for credit losses:      \n  \u2022    decrease of $5.7 billion, excluding the     \n       impact of net charge-offs                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       Divestitures: revenue (including gain on    \n       sales) of $3.0 billion and expenses of      \n  \u2022    $1.3 billion associated with the sales of   \n       Wells Fargo Asset Management, our           \n       Corporate Trust Services business, and our  \n       student loan portfolio                      \n                                                   \n                              \n  2023 Proxy Statement    55  \n                              \nExecutive Compensation Revenue (billions) Net      \nIncome (billions) Diluted Earnings Per Common Share\n(\u201cEPS\u201d) Efficiency Ratio 2 (Lower % indicates      \ngreater efficiency) Performance and Compensation   \nDetermination Process and Timeline Consistent with \nprior years, the HRC followed a systematic approach\nto set goals, to evaluate Company, individual, and \nas applicable, line of business performance, and to\ndetermine executive compensation. The HRC\u2019s process\nand timing are summarized below. 2022 Performance  \nGoals Performance categories for the Company and   \nthe NEOs, including the metrics that the HRC relies\non to assess performance, are derived from         \nstrategic pillars, as discussed under Strategic    \nPillars and Categories of Performance. The HRC, in \nthe first quarter of 2022, reviewed performance    \ngoals for each of the NEOs and approved such goals \nfor the CEO. In January 2023, the HRC then assessed\nCompany, individual, and, as applicable, line of   \nbusiness performance against these goals, which    \ndrove its determination of variable compensation   \noutcomes. Company performance is discussed under   \n2022 Company Performance. Performance and          \ncompensation summaries for our CEO and other NEOs  \nbegin under 2022 Executive Compensation Decisions. \nPerformance Year 2022 Total Compensation Targets,  \nPay Mix, and Pay-For-PerformanceOutcomes The HRC   \nestablishes total compensation targets for our NEOs\neach year. Compensation targets are based on the   \nrole and responsibilities of the individual, the   \nsize and scale of the role, market data for        \ncomparable roles, to the extent available, and     \nconsideration of other factors, such as individual \nexperience. The main purpose of having a           \ncompensation target is to allow the HRC            \n                                                   \n       Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Net Income,      \n       Adjusted Diluted EPS, and Adjusted          \n       Efficiency Ratio are non-GAAP financial     \n  1    measures. For additional information,       \n       including corresponding reconciliations to  \n       GAAP financial measures, refer to Notes on  \n       Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 127.    \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       Refer to Additional Information, page 130,  \n  2    Note\u00a04 for a further discussion of          \n       Efficiency Ratio.                           \n                                                   \n                               \n  56    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nExecutive Compensation                             \n                                                   \nto provide compensation opportunities to attract,  \nmotivate, and retain the most qualified senior     \nexecutive leadership team. For 2022, after a       \nthorough review, the HRC increased total           \ncompensation targets for Mr. Scharf, Mr. Weiss,    \nand Mr. Powell, as discussed under NEO Target      \nTotal Compensation, and maintained the total       \ncompensation targets for Mr. Santomassimo and Ms.  \nMack. The increases for Mr. Scharf, Mr. Weiss,     \nand Mr. Powell were primarily driven by an         \nincrease in the market pay levels for comparable   \nroles. All increases in target compensation are    \nin the form of variable compensation, which is     \n100% tied to performance. No changes were made to  \nbase salary. In addition to the total              \ncompensation targets, in the first quarter of      \n2022, the HRC also completed a market pay mix      \nassessment. This assessment informed the HRC\u2019s     \ndecision to establish a consistent variable        \ncompensation pay mix for all members of the        \nOperating Committee, including NEOs. As a result,  \ncash bonus targets, as a percentage of salary,     \nand individual value-based long-term incentive     \ntargets, were eliminated. Instead, for all NEOs    \nother than the CEO, 70% of variable compensation   \nis delivered as long-term equity with half         \ndelivered in PSAs and half in RSRs. The remaining  \n30% of variable compensation is delivered as cash  \nbonus. The HRC also established a pay mix for the  \nCEO, requiring a minimum of 75% of variable        \ncompensation to be delivered as long-term equity   \nand the balance as cash bonus. The CEO\u2019s long-     \nterm equity is also structured as PSAs and RSRs,   \nrepresenting an equity mix of 65% and 35%,         \nrespectively. Throughout 2022, the HRC             \nperiodically assessed the Company\u2019s performance    \nagainst pre-established goals. During the fourth   \nquarter of 2022 and January 2023, the HRC          \ncompleted in-depth reviews of all aspects of the   \nCompany\u2019s financial and non-financial              \nperformance, and individual NEO performance. In    \nJanuary 2023, the Board and the HRC approved the   \nfollowing 2022 compensation outcomes after         \nassessing performance for our CEO and other NEOs,  \nrespectively.

While this level of shareholder support   \nrepresents a significant increase from the         \nprevious year, it is still below our desired       \nlevels. Following the annual meeting, we           \ncontinued the efforts of active engagement with    \nshareholders. Our Board Chair and HRC Chair,       \nCorporate Secretary, and leaders from Human        \nResources, Investor Relations, and ESG teams       \nconducted multiple meetings with shareholders,     \nseeking their feedback on the enhancements and     \nprogress we already made and their suggestions on  \nhow we could continue to make progress. Our        \nshareholder engagement is summarized below. The    \nfull Board receives periodic updates from the HRC  \non shareholder feedback received during            \nshareholder engagement, including input related    \nto our executive compensation program. In          \naddition to gathering general feedback in 2022,    \nwe engaged with shareholders on specific topics    \npertaining to our executive compensation program.  \nDuring these discussions, shareholders generally   \nexpressed support for the changes discussed in     \nour 2022 CD&A. Shareholders also asked for more    \ninformation on certain aspects of our executive    \ncompensation program: base salary levels for the   \nCEO and the other NEOs, peer group selection and   \ntheir application to the HRC\u2019s planning and        \noversight processes, and the HRC\u2019s approach to     \ncompensation decision-making. The HRC\u2019s            \nperspective on each of these topics is discussed   \nbelow.                                             \nNEO Base Salary Levels                             \n                                                   \n       Following the 2008 financial crisis, Wells  \n       Fargo raised executives\u2019 base salary        \n       levels to provide a more balanced fixed     \n       and variable compensation mix. This action  \n       was implemented to address concerns         \n  \u2022    regarding the potential for incentive       \n       compensation arrangements to lead to        \n       excessive risk-taking within financial      \n       institutions. The Company maintains this    \n       practice given our efforts to promote       \n       effective risk management.                  \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       Base salaries are an important pay          \n       element. For NEOs, the HRC believes that    \n       base salary should represent a smaller      \n       percentage of total compensation. A         \n  \u2022    majority of the executive compensation      \n       should be delivered through variable        \n       compensation that is tied to achieving      \n       short-term and long-term performance        \n       objectives.                                 \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       The CEO and other NEOs continue to have     \n       significant levels of compensation at       \n       risk. As mentioned previously, the          \n       majority of target total compensation is    \n  \u2022    delivered through variable compensation,    \n       at least 75% of which, for the CEO, and     \n       70% for the other NEOs, consists of         \n       long-term equity awards, providing strong   \n       alignment with shareholder interests.       \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       Our pay for performance philosophy focuses  \n       on total target compensation in relation    \n       to our Labor Market Peer Group.             \n       Historically, the cash bonus targets were   \n       expressed as a percentage of base salary    \n       and long-term incentive targets were        \n       expressed in dollars. The HRC changed that  \n       design in 2022, eliminating the             \n       relationship between salary levels and      \n  \u2022    cash bonus targets. Instead, the HRC        \n       implemented a consistent variable           \n       compensation pay mix for the CEO and all    \n       other NEOs. The HRC sets the quantum of     \n       NEOs\u2019 target total compensation based on    \n       roles and responsibilities and taking into  \n       account Labor Market Peer Group             \n       compensation policies and practices. The    \n       level of base salary does not result in a   \n       higher level of total compensation.         \n                                                   \n                               \n  58    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nExecutive Compensation                             \nPeer Group Selection                               \n                                                   \n       Given the size, scale, and mix of our       \n       businesses, and the need to attract and     \n       retain the most qualified leadership team,  \n  \u2022    selecting the appropriate peer groups is a  \n       critical decision point for the HRC in      \n       order to properly assess our performance    \n       and compensation levels.                    \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       In 2020, the HRC, in consultation with its  \n       independent compensation consultant,        \n       determined that two separate peer groups    \n       provide a better balance, given that our    \n       primary talent competitors (Labor Market    \n       Peer Group) do not fully align with the     \n       types of organizations with which we        \n       compete for capital and customers, or best  \n       compare to how we are organized and the     \n  \u2022    regulations under which we operate          \n       (Financial Performance Peer Group). Our     \n       Financial Performance Peer Group includes   \n       only Global Systemically Important Banks,   \n       ensuring that the relative performance      \n       standards the HRC uses to evaluate our      \n       performance reflect banks that operate      \n       with the most similar set of regulatory     \n       requirements, providing the best            \n       comparison set when considering financial   \n       performance.                                \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       The HRC continues to rely on two separate   \n       peer groups, given their representative     \n       alignment with talent and compensation      \n       needs, on the one hand, and business and    \n  \u2022    performance, on the other. The HRC will     \n       continue to assess the appropriateness of   \n       our peer groups in relation to its          \n       executive compensation oversight and        \n       planning processes.                         \n                                                   \nHRC\u2019s Approach to Compensation Decisions           \n                                                   \n       The HRC believes that relying on a single   \n       formula to evaluate performance and         \n       determine compensation decisions is not     \n       practical and will fail to fully consider   \n  \u2022    risk, regulatory, and other non-financial   \n       outcomes that are critical to our success.  \n       In determining this approach to             \n       compensation decisions, the HRC considered  \n       the following important factors:            \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       We operate in a dynamic business            \n       environment where business and performance  \n  \u2022    needs change quickly, requiring             \n       flexibility to re-align our executive       \n       compensation program to support our talent  \n       and performance needs.                      \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       Our performance needs are diverse,          \n       reflecting the need to balance              \n       management\u2019s accountability for meeting     \n  \u2022    our annual commitments to shareholders and  \n       other stakeholders with making progress     \n       towards the attainment of our multi-year    \n       transformation goals.                       \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       Risk is multi-layered and complex,          \n       requiring high levels of informed           \n  \u2022    judgement to accurately assess performance  \n       and make variable compensation decisions    \n       that are balanced, reasonable, and          \n       appropriate.                                \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       Our executive compensation program          \n       incentivizes our NEOs to deliver against    \n       performance goals that are derived from     \n  \u2022    our strategic pillars, the first of which   \n       is our Risk and Control Culture. Our top    \n       priority remains building an appropriate    \n       risk and control infrastructure, which is   \n       fundamental and critical to our future.     \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       This rigorous process enables the HRC to    \n       evaluate Company, CEO, and each of our      \n       other NEO\u2019s overall performance, including  \n       financial and non-financial results. It     \n       informs the HRC\u2019s compensation decisions,   \n       ensuring they are balanced, reasonable,     \n       and appropriate. The performance goals the  \n       HRC sets in the beginning of the year       \n       include quantitative measures and           \n       qualitative goals. The HRC reviews          \n  \u2022    performance against these goals during and  \n       at the end of the year. This allows the     \n       HRC to make a holistic performance          \n       assessment which then informs the           \n       compensation decision. For the CEO and      \n       each of the other NEOs, the HRC determines  \n       target total compensation (including pay    \n       mixes) in the beginning of the year, and    \n       also pre-determines the weighting of        \n       Company, individual, and, as applicable,    \n       line of business performance.               \n                                                   \n                              \n  2023 Proxy Statement    59  \n                              \nExecutive Compensation                             \n                                                   \n1) 2022 Executive Compensation Program 2022 Pay    \nfor Performance Philosophy and Framework           \nExecutive Compensation Principles The Company\u2019s    \nexecutive compensation program is designed and     \nadministered in accordance with established        \ncompensation principles, each of which is an       \nessential component to driving strong, risk-       \nmanaged performance.

HRC, in consultation with its           \n  independent compensation consultant, approved a  \n  Labor Market Peer Group to better understand     \n  executive compensation policies and practices    \n  among those organizations with which we most     \n  directly compete for executive talent. The       \n  Labor Market Peer Group is shown below and is    \n  unchanged from that used for 2021.Labor Market   \n  Peer GroupAmerican Express CompanyBank of        \n  America Corporation*The\u00a0Bank\u00a0of\u00a0New\u00a0York\u00a0Mellon  \n  CorporationCitigroup, Inc.*The Goldman Sachs     \n  Group, Inc.*JPMorgan Chase\u00a0& Co.*Morgan          \n  Stanley*The PNC Financial Services Group,        \n  Inc.State Street CorporationU.S. Bancorp,        \n  Inc.*These banks also are included in our        \n  Financial Performance Peer Group.The HRC relies  \n  on the Labor Market Peer Group and guidance      \n  from Meridian, the independent compensation      \n  consultant, to develop an understanding of       \n  market compensation pay levels for executives    \n  in comparable roles, in addition to executive    \n  pay practices including program design and pay   \n  mixes, at companies we most directly compete     \n  with for executive talent. The HRC assesses      \n  peer pay levels each year in connection with     \n  its annual review of NEO compensation.NEO        \n  Target Total CompensationEach year the HRC       \n  reviews and approves the CEO\u2019s target total      \n  compensation, which includes base salary and     \n  target variable compensation, as part of its     \n  oversight of our executive compensation          \n  program. The actual variable compensation        \n  awarded is determined based on the HRC and       \n  Board\u2019s assessment of the Company\u2019s and CEO\u2019s    \n  performance. Once determined, total variable     \n  compensation is delivered as a cash bonus and    \n  long-term equity (PSAs and RSRs). The value our  \n  CEO will realize from PSAs and RSRs is a         \n  function of our future performance (for PSAs),   \n  his continuing service with the Company, and     \n  stock price.In February 2022, the HRC reviewed   \n  CEO target total compensation for Wells Fargo    \n  against each of the labor market peers relative  \n  to a comparison of revenue, assets, and market   \n  capitalization. As illustrated by the table      \n  below, CEO target total compensation did not     \n  fully reflect the size and scale of Wells Fargo  \n  in terms of revenue, assets, and market cap.     \n  The size metrics are widely used by our          \n  industry and those who follow it to quantify     \n  size, scale, and complexity on a consistent      \n  basis. In referencing market data, the HRC does  \n  not target a specific percentile, but, instead,  \n  uses data as a reference point. A summary of     \n  the pay and size analysis the HRC considered in  \n  its market assessment is summarized below.Wells  \n  Fargo vs Labor Market Peers:CEO Total            \n  Compensation (\u201cTC\u201d) and Select Size Metrics (as  \n  of 12/31/2021) by PercentilesBased on this       \n  analysis, the HRC determined that the CEO\u2019s      \n  target total compensation was not sufficiently   \n  aligned with peer pay levels. The HRC also       \n  considered that the CEO\u2019s target total           \n  compensation had not been adjusted since he was  \n  hired in 2019.2023 Proxy Statement61             \n                                                   \nExecutive Compensation                             \n                                                   \nIn response to its findings and based on the       \nbusiness conditions in which we operated at the    \nstart of 2022, the HRC increased the CEO\u2019s target  \ntotal compensation for 2022 to $27 million. The    \nentire value of the increase in 2022 target total  \ncompensation was delivered through an increase in  \ntarget variable compensation, subject to           \nperformance. This outcome reflected the HRC\u2019s      \ndesire to appropriately align our CEO\u2019s total      \ncompensation with the Labor Market Peer Group,     \nwhile allowing for year-to-yearvariability in      \nactual CEO pay as determined by the performance-   \nbased nature of the program. For 2022, as in       \nprior years, the HRC also reviewed and approved    \nthe other NEOs\u2019 target total compensation,         \ninformed by Labor Market Peer Group compensation   \npractices. Those annual targets reflect the size,  \nscale, and complexity of our business and the      \nskills and experiences needed to deliver against   \nthe Company\u2019s strategic pillars. Such              \ncompensation opportunities support the Company\u2019s   \nstrategic plan to generate long-term value         \nconsistent with the interests of shareholders.     \nFor performance year 2022, the HRC increased       \ntarget total compensation for Mr. Weiss and Mr.    \nPowell, reflecting the HRC\u2019s evaluation of market  \npay levels and a review of their performance and   \nresponsibilities. Target total compensation        \nremained unchanged from 2021 for the other NEOs.   \nFinancial Performance Peer Group Our current       \nFinancial Performance Peer Group is comprised of   \na subset of Global Systemically Important Banks    \nselected by the HRC to best reflect those          \ncompanies that compete with us for capital and     \ncustomers, and are most similar to us in terms of  \nscope, scale, regulatory requirements, and         \nbusiness mix. The HRC uses the Financial           \nPerformance Peer Group to assess our relative      \nperformance for purposes of measuring Company      \nfinancial performance and calculating PSA          \npayouts. The Financial Performance Peer Group is   \nshown below and was unchanged from that used for   \n2021.                                              \n                                                   \n                  Banco                            \n                  Santander,                       \n                  S.A.

and Variable             \nCompensation Determination Process 2022            \nPerformance Assessment Process The HRC assesses    \nNEO performance through evaluation against pre-    \nestablishedfinancial and non-financial goals.      \nThis process aligns variable compensation          \ndeterminations with performance against the        \nCompany\u2019s long-term value drivers and prudent      \nrisk oversight, and provides the HRC with the      \nability to reduce an individual NEO\u2019s performance  \nachievement level for material failures in risk    \nmanagement, including but not limited to           \nmisconduct. For DE&I, the HRC evaluates the CEO\u2019s  \nprogress on key Company-wide DE&I priorities, and  \nfor other NEOs, the HRC uses progress on diverse   \nrepresentation and inclusion across specific       \nunderrepresented groups of NEO senior leadership   \nteams, with potential adjustments to variable      \ncompensation based on a holistic assessment of     \nprogress increasing representation in these        \ngroups.                                            \n                  \n  1    Set Goals  \n                  \nStrategic Pillars and Categories of Performance    \nOur Board sets our strategic direction and risk    \nappetite, including approval of our strategic      \nplan annually. The strategic plan includes our     \nfive strategic pillars, which in turn are used to  \nframe the goals the HRC uses to assess Company,    \nindividual, and, as applicable, line of business   \nperformance. Three of the strategic pillars \u2013      \nRisk and Control Culture, Operational Excellence,  \nand Customer-Centric Culture and Conduct \u2013 focus   \non advancing our risk and control culture,         \nsupported by Technology and Innovation (4th        \npillar), to collectively drive our top priority    \nof building a risk and control infrastructure      \nappropriate for our size and complexity, and       \nFinancial Strength (5th pillar). The HRC uses a    \nrigorous approach in establishing performance      \ngoals that incentivize NEOs to deliver on the      \nCompany\u2019s strategic priorities. At the beginning   \nof each year, individual NEO goals are set with a  \nfocus on supporting broader Company goals. The     \ngoals are tailored and specific to each NEO\u2019s      \narea of responsibility. At the end of the year,    \neach NEO\u2019s performance is evaluated against the    \npre-established performance goals. The outcome of  \nthe performance evaluation is directly used to     \ndetermine NEO variable compensation. For 2022,     \nconsistent with 2021, the strategic pillars,       \nCompany, and individual NEO goals are broadly      \ncategorized below:                                 \n                                                   \n  *    Line of Business Goals are included for     \n       CEOs of each business line.                 \n                                                   \n                             \n  2    Evaluate Performance  \n                             \nThe HRC assesses performance holistically and      \nregularly monitors and reviews Company             \nperformance throughout the year. At the end of     \nthe year, the HRC assesses Company and individual  \nNEO performance against the specific financial     \nand non-financialgoals set at the beginning of     \nthe year. In the case of the CEO, the performance  \nassessment included a detailed review of           \nperformance for each of the pre-established goals  \nunder the above-mentioned broad categories. The    \nperformance assessment is shared with the HRC.     \nThe HRC then assesses the CEO\u2019s performance in an  \nexecutive session without him present. The HRC     \nprovides its summary to the full Board and the     \nBoard reviews and considers the CEO performance    \nassessment in its approval of CEO compensation.    \nFor                                                \n                               \n  64    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nExecutive Compensation                             \n                                                   \nother NEOs, the CEO provides his evaluation of     \nperformance for each individual against the        \ndetailed performance goals, for review and input   \nby the HRC. Finally, the HRC assigns achievement   \nlevels that include risk considerations for        \noverall Company and individual NEO performance,    \nand business performance for NEOs who head one of  \nour lines of business. For 2022, the HRC focused   \non our NEOs\u2019 progress in strengthening our risk    \nand control infrastructure, which includes         \naddressing open historical and emerging issues,    \nand advancing our business through technology and  \ninnovation to increase internal operational        \nefficiency so we can deploy resources to better    \nserve our customers and communities. These two     \nareas play significant roles in how we define      \nshort-term and long-term success, and              \naccordingly, played a significant role in the      \nHRC\u2019s holistic assessment of performance and       \ndetermination of variable compensation. We         \nanticipate that the HRC\u2019s focus on these two       \nareas will continue for the foreseeable future to  \nhelp drive the Company\u2019s transformation. In        \naddition, as part of the performance assessment,   \nthe CRO provides an independent risk assessment    \nfor each of the NEOs, other than the CEO. During   \nthis process, the CRO assesses the extent of each  \nNEO\u2019s (other than the CEO) involvement in and      \naccountability (if any) related to risk events     \nthat took place, or were identified, during the    \nyear, except for the CEO, for whom the risk        \nassessment is conducted by the HRC with input      \nfrom the Risk Committee Chair (who is also a       \nmember of the HRC). Further, each NEO is assessed  \non driving measurable progress towards advancing   \nthe Company\u2019s risk and control environment, which  \nincludes resolving outstanding regulatory matters  \nand commitments. The risk assessments are          \nincorporated into each NEO\u2019s overall performance   \nassessment, and the HRC may reduce or eliminate    \nan NEO\u2019s variable compensation for the applicable  \nperformance year due to risk failures, as well as  \nother actions under the Clawback and Forfeiture    \nPolicydepending on the impact of adverse risk      \noutcomes.                                          \n                      \n  3    Determine Pay  \n                      \nAs discussed in last year\u2019s CD&A, effective for    \nperformance year 2021, the HRC approved a new      \napproach to determine each NEO\u2019s total             \ncompensation, defined as the sum of base salary    \nand total variable compensation. Under this        \napproach, Company and individual NEO achievement   \nlevels, including line of business performance     \n(as applicable), are considered by the HRC to      \ndetermine total performance achievement, which     \nthen determines the quantum of the total variable  \ncompensation. Once the total variable              \ncompensation is determined, it is delivered        \nthrough the pre-set pay mix. The HRC implemented   \nthis approach to enhance disclosure of its         \nvariable compensation determination process.       \nRefer to the 2022 Executive Compensation           \nDecisionssection below for individual NEO          \nachievement level weightings used by the HRC to    \ndetermine variable compensation.                   \n                              \n  2023 Proxy Statement    65  \n                              \nExecutive Compensation                             \n                                                   \n3) 2022 Named Executive Officer Compensation 2022  \nCompany Performance Our Performance in Relation    \nto our Business Strategy The Company continued to  \nmake progress in transforming our business, while  \nstrengthening our risk and control                 \ninfrastructure, resolving legacy regulatory        \nmatters, investing for the future, engaging with   \nour customers and rebuilding their trust, and      \ndemonstrating and reinforcing our commitments to   \nour employees, communities, and other              \nstakeholders. As mentioned previously, the HRC     \nassessed 2022 Company performance using the        \nfollowing performance categories, which along      \nwith the underlying goals remained unchanged from  \n2021: Business Results The Company continued to    \nbuild upon its strong momentum from 2021. In       \n2022, the Company reported revenue of $73.8        \nbillion, net income of $13.2 billion, and diluted  \nEPS of $3.14. We delivered Return on Equity (\u201c     \nROE\u201d) and ROTCE 1of 7.5% and 9.0%, respectively.   \nWe also increased our quarterly common stock       \ndividend from $0.20 to $0.30 per share and         \nreturned $6.0 billion in capital through gross     \nshare repurchases. We continued to realize the     \nbenefits of our multi-year efficiency program,     \ngenerating approximately $3.5 billion in gross     \nexpense savings, and reducing our headcount by     \napproximately 4%. We maintained our Common Equity  \nTier 1 (\u201c CET1\u201d) ratio above our regulatory        \nrequirement. The Company also continued to make    \nprogress in key non-financial areas, delivering    \nagainst key milestones to address legacy           \nregulatory, litigation, and customer remediation   \nmatters. The Company had significant operating     \nlosses, primarily related to these historical      \nmatters, and the HRC considered the impact of      \nthese expenses when evaluating our financial       \nresults. These results were delivered while we     \nalso enhanced our digital and mobile capabilities  \nand added new products to better serve our         \ncustomers, made changes that helped customers      \navoid overdraft fees, and continued to support     \nour communities through financial donations to     \nnonprofits in support of housing, small business,  \nfinancial health, sustainability, and other        \ncommunity needs. Company performance was a key     \ninput into the determination of NEOs\u2019 2022         \nvariable compensation. The HRC considered key      \nfinancial and non-financial performance criteria   \nin evaluating 2022 Company performance. The HRC    \nthen assigned an overall Company performance       \nachievement level, as discussed in more detail     \nbelow.                                             \n                                                   \n       ROTCE is a non-GAAP financial measure.

of $27 million for       \nPerformance Year 2022. The HRC, in determining     \nMr. Scharf\u2019s individual achievement level of       \n110%, noted his strong leadership, demonstrated    \nprogress in addressing key risk and control        \nissues, supporting our customers and communities,  \nupgrading the senior leadership and management     \nteams, continuing to build a diverse and           \ninclusive workforce, and making strategic          \ndecisions and investments needed to position the   \nCompany for future success. The HRC also           \nconsidered the remaining work to transform the     \nCompany and Mr. Scharf\u2019s critical role in leading  \nthe transformation. Prior to the HRC reaching its  \nfinal recommendation to the Board, Mr. Scharf      \napproached the HRC and suggested that the HRC and  \nthe Board consider not increasing his total        \ncompensation for 2022. Mr. Scharf acknowledged     \nthe strong performance of the Company and          \nsignificant progress in its transformation         \njourney. He also noted the remaining work left to  \nbe completed and, therefore, did not believe an    \nincrease in compensation was appropriate. In       \nalignment with the executive compensation program  \ndesign, based on target total variable             \ncompensation of $24.5 million, and Company and     \nindividual performance weightings of 65% and 35%,  \nrespectively, the HRC would have derived a total   \nvariable compensation of $26.5 million, or $29.0   \nmillion in total compensation. The HRC discussed   \nMr. Scharf\u2019s suggestion, and with the support      \nfrom the independent compensation consultant, the  \nHRC ultimately decided to exercise negative        \ndiscretion and recommended to the Board to keep    \nMr. Scharf\u2019s compensation flat to last year. The   \nBoard approved the HRC\u2019s recommendation, and as a  \nresult, the Board determined to award Mr. Scharf   \nvariable compensation of $22 million. In taking    \nthis action, the Board expressed strong            \nconfidence in Mr. Scharf\u2019s leadership in driving   \nthe continued transformation of Wells Fargo and    \nvalues his ongoing contribution and commitment to  \nour shareholders, customers, communities, and      \nemployees.                                         \n                              \n  2023 Proxy Statement    71  \n                              \nExecutive Compensation                             \n                                                   \n  Michael P.

The HRC, in determining Mr.\u00a0Powell\u2019s  \n  individual performance achievement level of      \n  91%,\u00a0considered the continued progress to        \n  advance the front line control infrastructure    \n  and focus on regulatory deliverables, including  \n  the centralization of Front Line Control         \n  Management and the establishment of the Chief    \n  Operating Office Priority Issues Execution       \n  Office, along with implementation of front line  \n  issue verification process to enhance rigor      \n  around review and validation of issues. The HRC  \n  also recognized Mr.\u00a0Powell\u2019s leadership          \n  implementing the Company\u2019s Return to Office      \n  plan, and efforts to advance expense             \n  initiatives within the Chief Operating Office,   \n  while acknowledging the remaining work to be     \n  completed. In addition, Mr.\u00a0Powell made          \n  significant progress to advance diverse          \n  representation across senior leaders within the  \n  Chief Operating Office with an increase across   \n  underrepresented groups. As a result, the HRC    \n  approved an incremental $100,000 in variable     \n  compensation.2023 Proxy Statement79              \n                                                   \nExecutive Compensation                             \n                                                   \nLong-Term Equity Compensation Long-Term Equity     \nSimilar to the cash bonus determination, long-     \nterm equity awards are determined as a percentage  \nof total variable compensation. The HRC grants     \nPSAs and RSRs to promote long-term performance     \nand risk accountability. These objectives are      \nachieved by subjecting long-term equity awards to  \nour Clawback and Forfeiture Policy. The value      \nultimately realized from any long-term equity      \ngrant is also a function of the number of shares   \nthat vest and our stock price at the time of       \nvesting and settlement. Finally, PSAs carry        \nadditional performance requirements tied to our    \nabsolute and relative ROTCE and a TSR modifier     \nbased on our performance relative to our           \nFinancial Performance Peer Group. Absolute and     \nrelative ROTCE are used as the primary             \nperformance conditions in our PSAs. Effective for  \nPSAs granted in 2023 for 2022 performance, the     \nHRC increased the absolute ROTCE performance       \nlevel at the target and maximum payout levels.     \nFor the relative ROTCE component, the HRC set the  \ntarget objective at the median of the Financial    \nPerformance Peer Group, recognizing the            \nmeaningful increase in our ROTCE that would be     \nrequired to improve our relative performance.      \nFinally, and starting with the PSAs granted in     \n2022 (based on 2021 performance), the HRC added    \nan award payout modifier of +/-20%based on our     \nrelative TSR over the three-year performance       \nperiod. The TSR modifier supports management       \naccountability for our relative stock price        \nperformance at the end of the performance period   \nfor which an award is earned. 2023 PSA Program     \nOur PSA program appropriately balances the         \nimportance of absolute and relative performance    \nwhile maintaining rigorous performance targets.    \nThe key features of our 2023 PSA program, for the  \nawards granted in 2023 for 2022 performance,       \ninclude:                                           \n                                                   \n

In     \nthe first quarter of 2023, the HRC certified       \nattainment of 67% of target after adjusting        \nCompany and peer performance in accordance with    \nthe Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan and the  \napplicable form of award agreement. For 2020,      \nCompany and peer performance was adjusted for the  \neffect of the pandemic on credit loss reserves     \nand for certain other significant infrequently     \noccurring items. For 2021 and 2022, Company and    \npeer performance was adjusted for reversals of     \ncredit loss reserves taken in 2020. For 2022,      \nCompany performance was adjusted for operating     \nlosses in the third and fourth quarters of 2022.   \nAs a result of these adjustments, the Company\u2019s    \nROTCE ranking improved two places to 8 out of 12   \ncompanies. Mr. Scharf\u2019s PSAs were granted          \npursuant to the terms of his offer letter with     \nthe Company, which provides that for purposes of   \nany PSAs, the performance measurement will         \nexclude the impact of any penalties or other       \ncharges related to litigation, investigations, or  \nexaminations arising out of retail sales           \npractices of the Company, or arising out of other  \nmaterial regulatory matters related to the         \nconduct of the Company, in each case during        \nperiods prior to Mr. Scharf\u2019s commencement of      \nemployment with Wells Fargo. These adjustments     \ndid not alter the Company\u2019s ROTCE ranking or the   \npayout of the 2020 PSA for Mr. Scharf. For PSAs    \ngranted in 2021 and 2022, the HRC will certify     \nperformance following completion of the three-     \nyear performance periods ending December 31, 2023  \nand December 31, 2024, respectively.               \n                              \n  2023 Proxy Statement    81  \n                              \nExecutive Compensation                             \n                                                   \n4) Compensation Policies and Practices Risk        \nManagement and Accountability Our executive        \ncompensation program reinforces effective risk     \nmanagement through risk-balancing features that    \ndiscourage and mitigate excessive risk-taking and  \nan accountability framework that, under defined    \nconditions, enables the reduction, forfeiture, or  \nclawback of compensation in the event NEOs\u2019        \nactions, or inactions, result in specified         \nnegative outcomes for our Company.

upon or prior to     \nthe effectiveness of final New York Stock          \nExchange listing standards implementing such       \nrule. Deferred Compensation and Other Benefits     \nNEOs are eligible to participate in the same       \nbenefits generally available to all employees,     \nincluding health, disability, and other benefits,  \nand our Company 401(k) plan. Our Company matched   \nup to 6% of eligible 401(k) Plan participants\u2019     \ncertified compensation (subject to Internal        \nRevenue Service (\u201c IRS\u201d) limits) during 2022.      \nNEOs and certain other highly compensated team     \nmembers are also eligible to participate in our    \nDeferred Compensation Plan. This plan provides     \nfor supplemental Company matching contributions    \nfor any compensation deferred into the plan in     \nexcess of IRS limits that apply to the 401(k)      \nPlan by participants, including NEOs, that         \notherwise would have been eligible for a matching  \ncontribution under our Company\u2019s 401(k) Plan. The  \nHRC believes these programs are similar to, and    \ncompetitive with, those offered by our Labor       \nMarket Peer Group. We provide information about    \nthe benefits under these plans in the 2022 Non-    \nQualifiedDeferred Compensationtable and related    \nnarrative. Perquisites and Other Compensation The  \nHRC has intentionally limited perquisites for our  \nNEOs. We may pay for relocation-related services   \nfor our executives, including temporary housing,   \nmoving expenses, and home purchase closing         \nexpenses. The HRC may approve security measures,   \nincluding residential physical and cyber security  \nsystems and services, if determined to be in the   \nbusiness interests of our Company for the safety   \nand security of our executives and our Company\u2019s   \ninformation. In 2022, the HRC approved the cost    \nof assessing and implementing residential          \nphysical and cyber security improvements for our   \nNEOs, subject to a limit of $50,000 per NEO. The   \nHRC additionally approved ongoing maintenance of   \nresidential physical and cyber security systems    \nat a cost of up to $5,000 per NEO per year. Based  \nupon a security assessment conducted in 2022 by    \nan independent security consultant, the Company    \ndetermined that, for security purposes, Mr.        \nScharf, our CEO, should avoid traveling by         \ncommercial ground transport or aircraft. We        \nprovide a car                                      \n                              \n  2023 Proxy Statement    83  \n                              \nExecutive Compensation and driver to Mr. Scharf for\nbusiness travel, commuting, and personal use. Mr.  \nScharf has agreed to reimburse us for the          \nincremental cost of any use of the car and driver  \nother than for business travel and commuting. In   \naddition, the HRC approved, in 2022, Mr. Scharf\u2019s  \nuse of the corporate aircraft for personal flights \nin an amount of incremental cost not to exceed     \n$200,000 annually. Mr. Scharf has agreed to        \nreimburse us for the incremental cost of his       \npersonal use of the corporate aircraft which       \nexceeds this $200,000 annual limit. New Hire Sign- \nOnBonuses and Buy-OutEquity Awards As part of our  \nefforts to build out the senior management team and\nto attract and retain top executive talent, we can \nprovide sign-onbonuses and buy-outequity awards for\nnew hires. New hire sign-onbonuses and buy-        \noutequity awards are an effective means of making  \nup for compensation opportunities executives       \nforfeit when they leave a former employer to join  \nthe Company. We typically require NEOs to return   \nall or a portion of their sign-onbonus if, within a\ncertain period after joining us, they voluntarily  \nleave the Company or are involuntarily terminated  \nby the Company for cause. New hire equity awards   \nare used to incentivize executives to join without \nunnecessarily increasing annual compensation       \nlevels. These awards are generally subject to a    \ntime-based vesting period and such other terms and \nconditions as the HRC determines to be appropriate.\n                               \n  84    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nExecutive Compensation                             \n                                                   \n5) Compensation Governance Oversight Role of the   \nHRC and CEO The HRC believes that strong           \ngovernance and oversight of our executive          \ncompensation program is essential to the           \nCompany\u2019s long-term success. To achieve this, the  \nHRC is comprised of independent directors with     \nhuman capital risk and human capital management    \nexperience and qualifications, who are informed    \nby an independent compensation consultant, to      \nmake compensation decisions based on NEO           \nperformance, comparison of Labor Market Peer       \nGroup executive pay levels and pay practices,      \nbased on discussions throughout the year (in both  \nregularly scheduled meetings and special           \nmeetings, as appropriate). The HRC oversees the    \nCompany\u2019s performance management and incentive     \ncompensation programs and approves all             \ncompensation for the Company\u2019s executive           \nofficers, including the NEOs. The HRC sets the     \nannual financial and non-financialCompany          \nperformance goals, which are used to determine     \nvariable compensation pay, to ensure that they     \nare aligned with the Company\u2019s strategic plan,     \nrisk appetite, and risk and control framework.     \nOur NEOs each establish individual goals aligned   \nto our Company goals, which are reviewed by the    \nHRC, and approved for the CEO. The HRC evaluates   \nCompany results after the end of the performance   \nyear, considering financial and non-financial      \noutcomes, consistency with the strategic plan and  \nour risk appetite, prior year performance, and     \nexecution of key initiatives and other             \nqualitative factors. The CEO and HRC assess        \nCompany performance as the starting point when     \ndetermining compensation for each of the other     \nNEOs. For these NEOs, the CEO evaluates their      \nindividual performance and makes recommendations   \nregarding base salary and variable compensation    \nto the HRC, for their review and approval. For     \nthe CEO, the Board conducts a performance          \nevaluation against all his goals, including risk   \nmanagement and DE&I. The full Board then approves  \nthe CEO\u2019s compensation.                            \n                                                   \n                           Key HRC oversight       \n                           responsibilities \u00a0 \u2022\u2002\u2009  \n                           Approve compensation    \n                           philosophy and          \n  To fulfill its           principles \u00a0 \u2022\u2002\u2009        \n  responsibilities, the    Evaluate CEO            \n  HRC                      performance and         \n  has six standing         compensation \u00a0 \u2022\u2002\u2009      \n  meetings each year,      Evaluate and approve    \n  and                      compensation for        \n  special meetings, as     executive officers \u00a0 \u2022  \n  needed The HRC held:     Oversee human capital   \n  7 meetings in 2022 (8    risk and management,    \n  in total                 including talent and    \n  throughout 2022 and      succession planning \u00a0   \n  early 2023) 4            \u2022\u2002\u2009Oversee incentive    \n  meetings to assess       compensation risk       \n  Company and NEO          management \u00a0 \u2022\u2002\u2009        \n  performance and make     Oversee culture and     \n  2022 compensation        Code of Conduct \u00a0 \u2022\u2002\u2009   \n  decisions                Oversee reputation      \n                           risk related to         \n                           incentive compensation  \n                           \u2022\u2002\u2009Approve executive    \n                           incentive compensation  \n                           plans                   \n                                                   \nRole of Independent Compensation Consultant The    \nHRC is authorized to retain and obtain advice of   \nlegal, accounting, or other advisors at the        \nCompany\u2019s expense without prior management or      \nBoard approval. For 2022, the HRC retained an      \nindependent compensation consultant, Meridian, to  \nprovide independent advice on executive            \ncompensation matters and advise on the design and  \ndisclosure of the compensation elements. During    \nthe year, Meridian compiled compensation data for  \nthe Labor Market Peer Group and reviewed with the  \nHRC our executive compensation program generally   \nand as compared to those of our Labor Market Peer  \nGroup. Meridian also advised the HRC on the        \nreasonableness of our compensation levels          \ncompared to our Labor Market Peer Group and the    \nappropriateness of our executive compensation      \nprogram structure in supporting strategic          \npriorities and in consideration of shareholder     \nfeedback. On an annual basis, the HRC reviews the  \nservices performed by, and the fees paid to        \nMeridian. Upon conducting this review, the HRC     \ndetermined that Meridian does no other work for    \nour Company or management other than to provide    \nconsulting services to the GNC, HRC, and Board     \nthat are directly related to employee and non-     \nemployeedirector compensation. To help maintain    \nthe independence of any consultant retained by     \nthe HRC, the HRC is required under its charter to  \npre-approveall services performed for our Company  \nby Meridian, other than the services performed     \nfor the GNC with respect to non-employeedirector   \ncompensation. The HRC assessed Meridian\u2019s          \nindependence considering the NYSE listing          \nstandards and SEC rules and concluded that no      \nconflict of interest or independence concerns      \nexist.                                             \n                              \n  2023 Proxy Statement    85  \n                              \nExecutive Compensation Conclusion The HRC values   \nthe feedback received from our shareholders, and   \nbelieves the changes made to our executive         \ncompensation program in recent years are aligned   \nwith shareholder input. The HRC also believes that \nthe 2022 compensation decisions for our NEOs were  \nreasonable, appropriate, and consistent with our   \ncompensation principles. Compensation Committee    \nReport In its capacity as the compensation         \ncommittee of our Board, the HRC has reviewed and   \ndiscussed with management the Compensation         \nDiscussion and Analysis that immediately precedes  \nthis report. Based on this review and these        \ndiscussions, the HRC has recommended to our Board  \nthat the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be   \nincluded in this proxy statement and incorporated  \nby reference in our Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor  \nthe year ended December 31, 2022, for filing with  \nthe SEC.

On July 1, 2009, the    \nCash Balance Plan was frozen. As a result of the   \nmerger and this freeze, no additional retirement   \nbenefits or additional years of credited service   \nhave accrued for our NEOs since this date. The     \nNEOs\u2019 benefits will be paid to them from the Cash  \nBalance Plan upon retirement. Under the terms by   \nwhich the Wachovia Pension Plan was merged into    \nthe Cash Balance Plan, the NEOs\u2019 accounts receive  \ninterest credits based on the yield on             \n10-yearU.S. Treasury Constant Maturities. \u201cNormal  \nretirement age\u201d under the Cash Balance Plan is     \ndefined as age 65.

As of          \nDecember 31, 2022, none of our NEOs were           \nparticipating in the Deferred Compensation Plan.   \nWachovia Elective Deferral Plan and Wachovia       \nSavings Restoration Plan As a former Wachovia      \nexecutive, Mr. Weiss participated in the Wachovia  \nElective Deferral Plan and the Wachovia Savings    \nRestoration Plan. Participation in these plans     \nwas frozen and contributions ceased for the        \nWachovia Elective Deferral Plan, effective         \nDecember 31, 2008, and for the Wachovia Savings    \nRestoration Plan, effective December 31, 2007.     \nThe Wachovia Elective Deferral Plan is a frozen,   \nunfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan  \nthat allowed certain highly compensated employees  \nto defer base salary and/or incentive payments on  \na pre-taxbasis until a future date (generally      \nretirement, death, or separation from service).    \nThe terms of the plan required participants to     \nirrevocably elect the form of payment (either in   \ninstallments or in a lump sum) and permitted       \nearly withdrawal of account balances in the case   \nof an unforseeable emergency resulting in severe   \nfinancial hardship. In addition, participant       \nsalary deferral amounts were subject to a Company  \nmatch in certain circumstances. The Wachovia       \nSavings Restoration Plan is a frozen, unfunded,    \nnonqualified deferred compensation plan that       \npreviously provided for pre-taxdeferral            \ncontributions to restore Wells Fargo 401(k) Plan   \ncontributions beyond the IRS qualified plan        \ncontribution limitations. Employees with an        \nannual base salary greater than Internal Revenue   \nCode annual covered compensation limits were       \neligible to participate and could elect to         \ncontribute up to 30% of base salary. Wachovia      \nmatched participants\u2019 contributions on a dollar-   \nfor-dollarbasis up to 6% of base salary.           \nParticipants elected, at the time they joined the  \nplan, the timing of the payment of their account   \nbalances (on or after five years of                \nparticipation, or upon separation or retirement),  \nas well as the form and term of                    \n                               \n  94    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nExecutive Compensation                             \n                                                   \npayment of their accounts (lump sum or 10 annual   \ninstallments), and may petition for, and receive   \nan early distribution of, their account balances   \nin the event of an unforseeable emergency causing  \nsevere financial hardship. Participants are        \nentitled to invest all or a portion of their       \ndeferral accounts in one or more investment        \noptions available under the plans, which           \ngenerally mirror those offered in the Wells Fargo  \n401(k) Plan, and to receive the earnings on the    \ndeferred amounts based on those investment         \nelections upon distribution of the deferral        \naccounts, subject to income tax withholding.       \nWachovia Deferred Compensation Plan As a former    \nWachovia executive, Ms. Mack participated in the   \nWachovia Deferred Compensation Plan.               \nParticipation in this plan was frozen and          \ncontributions to the plan ceased, effective        \nDecember 31, 2001. The Wachovia Deferred           \nCompensation Plan was an unfunded, nonqualified    \ndeferred compensation plan that allowed certain    \nhighly compensated and management employees to     \ndefer base salary and/or incentive payments until  \na future date (generally retirement, death, or     \nseparation from service). Participants\u2019 account    \nbalances are credited on December 31 each year     \nwith a rate of interest equal to the average of    \nthe Prime Rate over four quarters plus 2%. The     \nplan specifies the form and term of payment for    \nparticipants\u2019 account balances and permits early   \nwithdrawal of account balances in certain          \ncircumstances, including periodic early voluntary  \nwithdrawals (subject to a 6% early withdrawal      \npenalty) and in the case of an emergency           \nresulting in severe financial hardship. Potential  \nPost-EmploymentPayments We do not have employment  \nor other severance agreements with our NEOs. The   \ntable below shows estimated post-employment        \npayments for our NEOs, assuming they had           \nterminated employment on December 31, 2022. To     \nestimate the payment amounts for each NEO, we      \nused the closing price of our common stock on      \nDecember 30, 2022 of $41.29.

For Mr.\u00a0Scharf, retirement    \n         means the termination of employment (i)\u00a0  \n         after reaching age 55 with five           \n         completed years of service or (ii)\u00a0based  \n         on such more favorable treatment as may   \n         apply under the practices of the Company  \n         in effect from time to time.

Under the LTIP,        \n  (5)    retirement generally occurs when a named  \n         executive has reached the earliest of     \n         (a)\u00a0age 55 with 5 completed years of      \n         service or (b) 80 points (with one point  \n         credited for each completed age year and  \n         one point credited for each completed     \n         year of service). As of December\u00a031,      \n         2022, none of our NEOs, other than Mr.\u00a0   \n         Weiss and Ms.\u00a0Mack, met this definition   \n         of retirement.                            \n                                                   \nUnder our Chair/CEO Post-Retirement Policy, Mr.    \nScharf is entitled to receive, for two years       \nfollowing his retirement, subject to approval of   \nour Board and HRC, office space, administrative    \nassistance, and a part-time driver, provided he    \nremains available for management consultation and  \ncontinues to represent us with our customers,      \ncommunity, and employees during this period.

Audit Committee  \npolicy prohibits KPMG from providing certain non-  \nauditservices to us and requires all audit and     \npermissible non-auditservices provided by KPMG to  \nbe pre-approvedby the Audit Committee. There are   \nthree methods for pre-approvingKPMG services.      \n                                                   \n       The Audit Committee may pre-approve, on an  \n       annual basis, recurring services such as    \n       the audits of our annual financial          \n       statements and internal control over        \n       financial reporting and the review of our   \n       quarterly financial statements.             \n       Preliminary fee levels will not exceed      \n       amounts pre-approved for these services in  \n       the preceding calendar year, and a          \n       subsequent refinement of the actual fees    \n       incurred as a result of changes in the      \n  \u2022    scope of services will be submitted to the  \n       Audit Committee for pre-approval. The       \n       Audit Committee or a designee must          \n       pre-approve changes in the scope of         \n       recurring services if they will result in   \n       fee increases in excess of a relatively     \n       small amount established by the Audit       \n       Committee prior to such additional          \n       services being provided by KPMG. Changes    \n       in the scope of pre-approved services with  \n       estimated costs less than that amount may   \n       be approved by the Chief Accounting         \n       Officer and Controller.                     \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       The Audit Committee may pre-approve, for a  \n       particular calendar year, specific types    \n       of audit, audit-related, advisory,          \n       consulting, or tax services that could      \n       arise with respect to that calendar year    \n       that were not already pre-approved as       \n       recurring services, subject to a fee cap    \n  \u2022    for each category for that year. The Audit  \n       Committee also provided the Chief           \n       Accounting Officer with 2023 pre-approval   \n       authority for audit, audit related, tax,    \n       and other services including services       \n       subject to the annual cap fee for each      \n       category of up to $1 million, $350,000,     \n       and $500,000, respectively.                 \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       The Audit Committee may pre-approve, from   \n       time to time during the year, services      \n  \u2022    that have neither been pre-approved as      \n       recurring services nor pre-approved         \n       pursuant to the categorical pre-approval    \n       described above.                            \n                                                   \nIn determining whether to pre-approvethe           \nprovision by KPMG of a permissible non-            \nauditservice, the Audit Committee considers the    \nfacts and circumstances of the engagement,         \nincluding other non-auditservices provided by      \nKPMG and the fees for those services, and whether  \nthe provision of the non-auditservice by KPMG      \ncould impair the independence of KPMG with         \nrespect to us. The Audit Committee also considers  \nwhether KPMG is best positioned to provide the     \nservice because of its familiarity with our        \nbusiness, culture, accounting systems, risk        \nprofile, and other factors, and whether there are  \nalternatives reasonably available to us and the    \ncost of those alternatives. The Audit Committee    \nrequires competitive bidding for services that     \nare eligible for categorical pre-approvaland       \nservices subject to individual pre-approvalunless  \nit is not warranted because of the facts and       \ncircumstances of the proposed engagement. The      \nAudit Committee has delegated pre-                 \napprovalauthority to designated Audit Committee    \nmembers. Pre-approvalby a designated Audit         \nCommittee member is used for time-sensitive        \nengagements. Pre-approvaldecisions by a            \ndesignated Audit Committee member are reported to  \nthe full Audit Committee at a future meeting.      \n                               \n  2023 Proxy Statement    103  \n                               \n                                                   \n  Shareholder ProposalsItems\u00a05 through             \n  11Shareholder ProposalsShareholders will vote    \n  on the following shareholder proposals (Items 5  \n  through 11), if they are properly presented at   \n  our annual meeting and not previously withdrawn  \n  or otherwise excluded.

If    \nnecessary this means the closest standard to a     \nmajority of the votes cast for and against such    \nproposals consistent with applicable laws. This    \nincludes any existing supermajority vote           \nrequirement that result form default to state law  \nand can be subject to replacement. Shareholders are\nwilling to pay a premium for shares of companies   \nthat have excellent corporate governance.          \nSupermajority voting requirements have been found  \nto be one of 6 entrenching mechanisms that are     \nnegatively related to company performance according\nto \u201cWhat Matters in Corporate Governance\u201d by Lucien\nBebchuk, Alma Cohen and Allen Ferrell of the       \nHarvard Law School. Supermajority requirements are \nused to block proposals supported by most          \nshareholders but opposed by a status quo           \nmanagement.

There is  \n        only one explicit supermajority vote       \n        requirement involving our common stock in  \n        the Company\u2019s governance documents. Under  \n        our By-Laws, 80% of the holders of our     \n        common stock are required to amend a       \n        historical By-Law provision requiring      \n        that the Company vote in favor of local    \n  1.    directors for certain financial services   \n        company subsidiaries. Notably, this        \n        provision only applies if, among other     \n        things, the Company agrees to be bound by  \n        the requirement when acquiring the stock   \n        of such bank subsidiaries. Furthermore,    \n        only the Company and other holders of      \n        equity in the Company\u2019s subsidiaries, if   \n        applicable, may vote for the election of   \n        directors for such subsidiaries.           \n                                                   \n                                                   \n        Delaware Law Default. The only other       \n        supermajority requirement relates to a     \n        Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d)  \n        provision, which by default requires       \n        supermajority approval for certain         \n        interested shareholder transactions. This  \n        requirement is consistent with best        \n        practices in the market and applies to     \n  2.    approximately 90% of                       \n        Delaware-incorporated S&P 500 companies,   \n        including all of the Company\u2019s Delaware    \n        peers, none of which have elected to opt   \n        out of this provision.2 This provision is  \n        appropriately intended to ensure that      \n        there is significant support before a      \n        transaction with an interested             \n        shareholder is effected.                   \n                                                   \nIn addition, the Board believes that the           \nproposal\u2019s request for adoption of a majority of   \nvotes cast standard for all matters presented to   \nshareholders will not be meaningful, as the        \nexisting majority vote standard is sufficient and  \nappropriately protects shareholder interests.      \nUnder the Company\u2019s current governance standards:  \n                                                   \n        directors are elected by a simple          \n  1.    majority of the votes cast in uncontested  \n        elections;                                 \n                                                   \n                                                   \n        most matters presented at a shareholder    \n        meeting are otherwise determined by a      \n  2.    simple majority of common stock shares     \n        present and entitled to vote on the        \n        subject matter; and                        \n                                                   \n                                                   \n  3.    amendments to our By-Laws require a        \n        majority of shares outstanding.            \n                                                   \nFurthermore, our By-Lawsand other corporate        \ngovernance practices reflect sound and effective   \ncorporate governance principles and                \nresponsiveness to our shareholders.

The Company  \nregularly reviews its participation model and      \nbelieves that engagement through these trade       \norganizations, even potentially as a voice of      \nopposition from time-to-time,is an integral part   \nof our public policy strategy and best serves our  \ncustomers, company, employees, and communities.    \nParticipation in these groups comes with the       \nunderstanding that we may not always agree with    \nevery position taken. In instances where we        \nidentify significant misalignment with trade       \nassociations to which we belong, we aim to share   \nour perspective in a constructive manner.          \nAdditionally, we are not members of any tax-       \nexemptorganization in the United States that is    \nprimarily organized to write, endorse, and         \npromote model legislation. Wells Fargo sponsors    \nnon-partisanPACs that make contributions to        \ncandidates. These Wells Fargo PACs only accept     \nfunding through voluntary contributions by         \neligible employees and directors. Decisions about  \nwhich candidates receive support are made by the   \nGRPP team using established criteria to guide      \ndecision-making relating, including supporting     \ncandidates who understand the important role the   \nfinancial services industry plays in the economy,  \nwho are in leadership positions, who serve on key  \ncommittees, and who represent areas with a         \nsignificant base of our customers and employees.   \nIn addition, the Corporate Responsibility          \nCommittee of the Board oversees the Company\u2019s      \nsignificant government relations strategies,       \npolicies, and programs and receives updates on     \nthe Company\u2019s political activities and             \ncontributions. We already disclose detailed        \ninformation on our GRPP website regarding our      \nfederal lobbying activities, memberships in        \nprincipal national trade associations,             \ncontributions to entities organized under          \nSections 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, and     \nbi-partisancampaign contributions made by Wells    \nFargo\u2019s non-partisanPACs. Moreover, earlier this   \nyear, the Company enhanced the content on our      \nGRPP website to include information regarding our  \ndecision-making approach for our political         \nengagement. For its political spending reporting,  \nWells Fargo has been named to the top tier         \n\u201cTrendsetter\u201d status (scoring 90 percent or        \nhigher) for six of the last seven years by the     \nCenter for Political Accountability-Zicklin Index  \nof Corporate Political Disclosure and              \nAccountability. Our Board believes that            \ndeveloping the requested annual report would be    \nan on-going,time-consuming, and costly endeavor,   \nand would not provide additional value to our      \nshareholders given the Company\u2019s existing          \ndisclosures.

Major companies have enormous influence and\nbipartisan credibility to help establish a policy  \nenvironment that will avert the most dire climate  \nrisks and take advantage of the opportunity of this\ngenerational economic shift. Corporate lobbying    \nthat is inconsistent with the Paris Agreement poses\nescalating material risks to companies and         \ninvestors. 6 The Company committed to advocate for \npolicies that enable client transitions to net zero\nemissions. 7However, the Company\u2019s positions on and\ndetails of engagement with policymakers are        \nunclear. 8A recent letter submitted to the         \nMunicipal Advisory Council of Texas shows evidence \nof the Company\u2019s continued support for investing in\nfossil fuels. 9The Company\u2019s sponsorship of the    \nState Financial Officers Foundation, which has been\nweaponizing state treasurers\u2019 offices against      \nclimate-related financial risk management, has been\ncalled out by members of Congress. 10 Of increasing\nconcern are trade associations and other policy    \norganizations that speak for business but too often\npresent major obstacles to addressing the climate  \ncrisis. The Company is a member of financial       \nindustry associations which are opposing emerging  \nsustainable finance policy, including the U.S.     \nChamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, and  \nthe California Chamber of Commerce. 11             \nRESOLVED:Shareholders of Wells Fargo and Company   \nrequest that the Board of Directors analyze and    \nreport to shareholders annually (at reasonable     \ncost, omitting confidential and proprietary        \ninformation) on whether and how it is aligning its \nlobbying and policy influence activities and       \npositions, both direct and indirect through trade  \nassociations, coalitions, alliances, and other     \norganizations, with its public commitment to       \nachieve net zero emissions by 2050 including the   \nactivities and positions analyzed, the criteria    \nused to assess alignment, and involvement of       \nstakeholders, if any, in the analytical process.   \nSUPPORTING STATEMENT:In evaluating the degree of   \nalignment between the Company\u2019s emissions goals and\nits lobbying, the Company should disclose its      \ndirect and indirect policy positions and lobbying  \nactions with regard to climate provisions of key   \ninternational, federal and state legislation and   \nregulation.

In March 2021, Wells Fargo           \ncommitted to deploy $500 billion in sustainable    \nfinance by 2030 and announced a goal of aligning   \nfinancing activities with net-zerogreenhouse gas   \nemissions by 2050. We have been clear in our       \ncommitment to finance the energy needed by our     \ncountry and the world today while spurring         \ndevelopment of the energy needed for tomorrow. We  \nengage in public policy advocacy on many issues    \nimpacting our business at the local, state, and    \nfederal levels. As part of this engagement, Wells  \nFargo is a member of a number of trade             \nassociations and industry groups, which cover      \nmany industries, or topics, or both. The Company   \nbelieves that engagement through these trade       \norganizations, even potentially as a voice of      \nopposition from time-to-time,is an integral part   \nof our public policy strategy and best serves our  \ncustomers, employees, businesses, and              \ncommunities. Moreover, the Corporate               \nResponsibility Committee of the Board oversees     \nthe Company\u2019s significant government relations     \nstrategies, policies, and programs and receives    \nupdates on the Company\u2019s political activities and  \ncontributions. We disclose detailed information    \nabout our political activities, including:         \n                                                   \n       Quarterly reports filed with the U.S.       \n       Congress to disclose our federal lobbying   \n  \u2022    activities, consistent with the             \n       requirements of the Lobbying Disclosure     \n       Act;                                        \n                                                   \n                                                   \n  \u2022    Membership in principal trade               \n       associations;                               \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       Contributions to entities organized under   \n  \u2022    Sections 527 of the Internal Revenue Code;  \n       and                                         \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       Bi-partisan campaign contributions made by  \n       Wells Fargo\u2019s non-partisan PACs, which      \n  \u2022    only accept funding through voluntary       \n       contributions by eligible employees and     \n       directors.                                  \n                                                   \nAnd earlier this year, we enhanced the content on  \nour GRPP website to include information regarding  \nour decision-making approach for our political     \nengagement. For its political spending reporting,  \nWells Fargo has been named to the top tier         \n\u201cTrendsetter\u201d status (scoring 90 percent or        \nhigher) for six of the last seven years by the     \nCenter for Political Accountability- Zicklin       \nIndex of Corporate Political Disclosure and        \nAccountability. Wells Fargo already discloses      \ninformation reflecting our political and lobbying  \nactivity. The additional, prescriptive annual      \nreport requested by the proponent focused on a     \nsingle issue is unnecessary given the extent of    \nWells Fargo\u2019s existing disclosures. We believe     \nthe requested report would not add additional      \nvalue to our shareholders and therefore would not  \nbe a prudent use of Company resources.

The    \nUnited Nations has recommended that financial      \ninstitution transition plans demonstrate how all   \nparts of the business align with interim targets   \nand long-term net zero targets. 2Other guidelines  \nexist to help financial institutions operationalize\nand translate net zero commitments into strategies \n\u201cwith specific objectives . . . against which      \nprogress can be assessed.\u201d 3,4 Wells Fargo is the  \nthird largest global financer of fossil fuels, with\n$46 billion in fossil fuel financing in 2021, and  \nnearly $272 billion between 2016 through 2021. 5Of \nthe top 3 fossil fuel funders, only Wells increased\nits fossil fuel funding above 2019 levels. 6       \nRecognizing the need for action, and the importance\nof achieving global 1.5\u00b0C climate goals, Wells is a\nmember of the NZBA. In March 2021, Wells announced \na Net Zero by 2050 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)  \nreduction goal. It also announced five broad areas \nof focus toward this goal. In addition to its Net  \nZero target, it disclosed an approach for measuring\nand annually disclosing its financed emissions; it \ncommitted to and has set 2030 reduction targets for\nthe oil & gas and power portfolio sectors; it      \nestablished an institute for sustainable finance to\nassist clients achieve GHG emissions reductions;   \nand integrated climate into its risk management    \nframework. 7 These are important and critical first\nsteps. But Wells cannot stop there. Shareholders   \nare concerned that Wells does not have, or does not\ndisclose, a transition plan for how it will achieve\nits 2030 sectoral reductions targets. An effective \ntransition plan creates bank accountability by     \ndescribing the affirmative strategies, indicators, \nmilestones, metrics, and timelines necessary to    \ndeliver on its decarbonization targets and ensure  \ninvestors that the bank is fully accountable for   \nthe risks associated with its financing of high-   \ncarbon activities. A transition plan could include,\nfor example, disclosure of clients\u2019 estimated      \nannual reductions and how the bank plans to achieve\nremaining reductions. Additional actions may       \ninclude client and employee incentives or          \ndisincentives; setting requirements, including loan\napproval guidelines, investment and underwriting   \npriorities or prohibitions; and policies or        \nguidelines that otherwise restrict, limit, or      \ncondition bank business activities, among others.  \nClimate Transition Report \u2013 Statement in Opposition\nOur Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal, \nwhich is identified as Item 8 on the proxy card,   \nfor the following reasons:                         \n                                                   \n       In March 2021, Wells Fargo announced a      \n       goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions,  \n       including financed emissions, by 2050.      \n       Then, in May 2022, we published our         \n  \u2022    interim emissions targets for 2030 for our  \n       Oil\u00a0& Gas and Power portfolios, as well as  \n       our methodology for aligning financial      \n       portfolios to the goals of the Paris        \n       Agreement.                                  \n                                                   \n                                                 \n  1    https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-banking/  \n                                                 \n                                                   \n  2    https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files\u2026  \n       p.21-22                                     \n                                                   \n                                                   \n  3    https://www.iigcc.org/media/2022/07/An-in\u2026  \n                                                   \n                                                   \n  4    https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/63/\u2026  \n                                                   \n                                                   \n  5    https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/20\u2026  \n                                                   \n                                                   \n  6    https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/20\u2026  \n                                                   \n                                                   \n  7    https://newsroom.wf.com/English/news-rele\u2026  \n       default.aspx                                \n                                                   \n                               \n  2023 Proxy Statement    111  \n                               \nShareholder Proposals                              \n                                                   \n       Also in May 2022, we announced our intent   \n       to augment our independent targets with     \n       high-level transition plans that outline    \n  \u2022    categories of actions we expect to take to  \n       meet our 2030 targets for the Oil\u00a0& Gas     \n       and Power sectors. Wells Fargo\u2019s work on    \n       these transition plans is informed by       \n       emerging industry guidance.                 \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       Wells Fargo continues to monitor evolving   \n  \u2022    regulatory requirements and market          \n       practices concerning the public disclosure  \n       of transition plans.                        \n                                                   \nWe believe that climate change is one of the most  \nurgent environmental and social issues of our      \ntime, and financial institutions like Wells Fargo  \ncan play an important role in helping to address   \nit by supporting our clients in their transition   \nto a low-carbonfuture. Since announcing our goal   \nof net-zerogreenhouse gas emissions, including     \nfinanced emissions, in March 2021, Wells Fargo     \nhas taken meaningful steps forward. On May 4,      \n2022, we disclosed interim targets for reducing    \ngreenhouse gas emissions attributable to our       \nfinancing activities in the Oil & Gas and Power    \nsectors. The 2030 reduction targets announced in   \n2022 for these sectors, based on a 2019 baseline,  \nwere:                                              \n                                                   \n  \u2022    Oil\u00a0& Gas sector: 26% reduction in          \n       absolute emissions                          \n                                                   \n                                                   \n  \u2022    Power sector: 60% reduction in portfolio    \n       emissions intensity                         \n                                                   \nThese targets are detailed in Wells Fargo\u2019s        \nCO2eMission SM, our methodology for aligning       \nfinancial portfolios to the 1.5 degree Celsius     \ngoal of the Paris Agreement and for setting        \ninterim, emissions-based targets to guide that     \nalignment. The CO2eMission publication is          \navailable on Wells Fargo\u2019s website. This           \nmethodology not only helps us set targets but      \nalso allows us to compare the pace of transition   \nwithin given portfolios, enabling us to adapt and  \nevolve over time. When setting these initial       \ntargets and publishing the CO2eMission             \nmethodology, Wells Fargo committed to develop      \nhigh-level transmission plans that outline         \ncategories of action we expect to take to meet     \nour 2030 targets for the Oil & Gas and Power       \nsectors (see the Executive Summary of CO2eMission  \nfor more information). In line with this           \nstatement, Wells Fargo now is developing           \ntransition plans and continues to monitor          \nevolving regulatory requirements and market        \npractices concerning their public disclosure.      \nWells Fargo\u2019s independent work on transition       \nplans is proceeding in general alignment with      \nNet-ZeroBanking Alliance guidelines and practical  \nguidance from groups like the Glasgow Financial    \nAlliance for Net Zero. In addition, the proposed   \nclimate-related disclosure rule under              \nconsideration by the Securities and Exchange       \nCommission (SEC) ultimately may require companies  \nwith emissions-related targets or goals to         \ndisclose how they intend to meet those targets or  \ngoals, as well as annual progress made. We         \nbelieve Wells Fargo\u2019s existing work developing     \ntransition plans in line with evolving market      \npractices remains the prudent approach, and we do  \nnot believe that producing the report required by  \nthe proposal would ultimately serve the best       \ninterests of our shareholders.

In May 2022,   \n  \u2022    we announced an interim reduction target    \n       of 26\u00a0percent by 2030 (over our 2019        \n       baseline) in emissions attributed to our    \n       lending and debt and equity capital         \n       markets facilitation for the Oil\u00a0& Gas      \n       sector.                                     \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       Achieving net-zero greenhouse gas           \n       emissions by 2050 requires concerted        \n       action from a host of stakeholders,         \n       including supportive government policies,   \n       public investment, shifts in business       \n       models and consumer behavior, and the       \n  \u2022    commercialization of new decarbonizing      \n       technologies. As a bank, we are focused on  \n       working with clients in a broad range of    \n       sectors of the U.S. economy, including the  \n       Oil\u00a0& Gas sector, to provide the financial  \n       services needed to support an orderly       \n       energy transition.                          \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       Oil and gas remain important energy         \n       sources; economic forecasts and net-zero    \n       scenarios suggest these fossil fuels will   \n  \u2022    remain an important part of the energy mix  \n       for decades to come. Recent geopolitical    \n       events underscore the need to address       \n       energy security and avoid unintended        \n       impacts on vulnerable communities.          \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       We do not believe restricting financing to  \n       the Oil\u00a0& Gas sector is reasonable given    \n       the significant adverse impact that         \n       curtailing financing to this sector would   \n       have on the U.S. and world economies.       \n  \u2022    Also, this approach is counterproductive    \n       at a time when many of these companies are  \n       investing in their own climate              \n       transitions, pursuing emissions reductions  \n       in their operations, and developing new     \n       clean energy solutions.                     \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       For all of these reasons, our intent is to  \n       continue financing the energy needs of      \n       today, which includes the Oil\u00a0& Gas         \n       sector, while appropriately managing        \n  \u2022    associated environmental and social risks   \n       and funding the development of cleaner      \n       energy sources. Through this approach, we   \n       believe Wells Fargo can play our part in    \n       helping to facilitate an orderly energy     \n       transition.                                 \n                                                   \nWells Fargo continues to view climate change as    \none of the most urgent environmental and social    \nissues of our time, and we are committed to        \nsupporting clients with financial services to      \nfacilitate an orderly energy transition and a      \nsustainable future. Since March 2021, we have      \nbeen taking meaningful steps toward our goal of    \nnet-zerogreenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In May   \n2022, we published a methodology to set targets    \nfor carbon-intensive sectors and set interim       \nemissions targets for 2030 for our Oil & Gas and   \nPower portfolios aligned to the Network for        \nGreening the Financial System (NGFS) Orderly Net   \nZero 2050 scenario. With respect to the Oil & Gas  \nsector, Wells Fargo\u2019s interim target was crafted   \nto capture substantially all emissions in the      \nvalue chain, including those associated with the   \nultimate consumption of oil and gas produced by    \nour clients (please see CO2eMission SMfor          \nadditional detail). While we evaluate interim      \nreduction targets in other carbon-intensive        \nsectors, we are working in parallel on transition  \nplans to describe the actions we intend to take    \nto meet our Oil & Gas and Power targets. However,  \nthe policy suggested by the proponents \u2013 that we   \nadopt a time-based phase out of lending and        \nunderwriting activities that contribute to new     \nfossil fuel development \u2013 runs counter to our      \nefforts to partner with Oil & Gas sector clients   \nin the energy industry\u2019s transformation.           \nBusinesses in the Oil & Gas sector predominantly   \nrely on general purpose financing for their        \noperations. As such, adoption of a time-bound      \nphase out of lending to companies involved in oil  \nand gas exploration would effectively preclude     \nWells Fargo from offering financing to the Oil &   \nGas sector by an arbitrary end date.We do not      \nbelieve this approach is reasonable based on       \ncurrent and projected energy usage and the         \npotential negative impacts such a restrictive      \npolicy could have on the U.S. and world            \neconomies. For the reasons stated above, we        \nbelieve our target-setting approach and ongoing    \nparticipation in financing the Oil & Gas sector,   \nas well as the development of renewable energy     \nsources, will best facilitate an orderly energy    \ntransition. Accordingly, we do not believe that    \nadopting the prescriptive policy recommended by    \nthe proposal would ultimately serve the best       \ninterests of our shareholders.

Most recently, its   \nhiring practices came under scrutiny when it was   \nreported that the Company conducted interviews of  \ndiverse candidates for positions that had already  \nbeen filled and subsequent retaliation against     \nthose employees that complained about the sham     \ninterviews. It has also been reported that the     \nUnited States Attorney in the Southern District of \nNew York\u2019s criminal division is investigating      \npossible violations of federal laws based on this  \nreporting. The Securities Exchange Commission has  \nshown increased attention to human capital         \nmanagement issues, as demonstrated by its 2020     \nrulemaking and the Chairman\u2019s public comments about\nfuture, more proscriptive disclosure rulemaking.   \nThere have been several high-profile derivative    \nsuits settled recently, including at Twentieth     \nCentury Fox, Wynn Resorts, and Alphabet, alleging  \nboards breached their duties by failing to protect \nemployees from discrimination and harassment,      \ninjuring the companies and their shareholders. A   \npublic report such as the one requested would      \nassist shareholders in assessing whether the       \nCompany is improving its workforce management.     \nCivil rights violations within the workplace can   \nresult in substantial costs to companies, including\nfines and penalties, legal costs, costs related to \nabsenteeism, and reduced productivity. A company\u2019s \nfailure to properly manage its workforce can have  \nsignificant ramifications, making it more difficult\nto retain and recruit employees, and jeopardize    \nrelationships with customers and other partners.   \nAnnual Report on Prevention of Workplace Harassment\nand Discrimination \u2013 Statement in Opposition Our   \nBoard recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal,     \nwhich is identified as Item 10 on the proxy card,  \nfor the following reasons:                         \n                                                   \n       We have policies and programs that are      \n       comprehensive and regularly reinforced,     \n  \u2022    including through annual training for U.S.  \n       employees, and we believe they reflect our  \n       commitment to preventing harassment and     \n       discrimination.                             \n                                                   \n                               \n  2023 Proxy Statement    115  \n                               \nShareholder Proposals                              \n                                                   \n       Since 2020, the Company does not require    \n       arbitration for sexual harassment claims.   \n  \u2022    In addition, the Company does not include   \n       the types of confidentiality clauses        \n       identified in the proposal in the           \n       agreements employees sign when hired.       \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       The Human Resources Committee is            \n       responsible for overseeing human capital    \n  \u2022    management and receives regular reports on  \n       culture metrics, including reporting on     \n       harassment and discrimination allegations.  \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       We do not believe that the proposed report  \n       would provide shareholders with meaningful  \n       information on our efforts to prevent       \n  \u2022    workplace harassment and discrimination     \n       and would require a level of disclosure     \n       that is not common practice among our       \n       peers or the broader market.                \n                                                   \nThe Company maintains policies that are intended   \nto prohibit harassment and discrimination and      \nencourage reporting of any suspected workplace     \nmisconduct. Our policies specifically prohibit     \ndiscrimination and harassment on the basis of      \nrace, color, gender, national origin, religion,    \nage, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender   \nexpression, genetic information, physical or       \nmental disability, pregnancy, marital status,      \nhairstyles or hair texture, status as a protected  \nveteran, or any other status protected by          \nfederal, state, or local law. We provide multiple  \navenues for employees to raise concerns            \n(including an anonymous option) and our policies   \nprohibit retaliation of any kind against anyone    \nfor providing information in good faith (or        \notherwise in accordance with applicable country-   \nspecific laws). The Company\u2019s commitments in this  \narea are reinforced and communicated through       \nemployee training programs. U.S. employees are     \nrequired to complete anti-harassment and           \ndiscrimination training annually. This training    \ncovers expectations for workplace conduct, helps   \nemployees recognize situations that may involve    \nharassment or discrimination, and describes the    \nways in which employees can report harassment and  \ndiscrimination matters without fear of             \nretaliation. The Company regularly assesses its    \nworkforce management as part of providing a safe,  \nhealthy, and accessible environment to employees.  \nWhile our goal is prevention, when an allegation   \nof discrimination or harassment is made, the       \nCompany\u2019s policies require that we thoroughly and  \nobjectively investigate it and take appropriate    \naction, up to and including termination of any     \nemployee found to have engaged in inappropriate    \nconduct. In addition, our Human Resources          \nCommittee is responsible for overseeing human      \ncapital risk, human capital management and the     \nCompany\u2019s culture, and receives regular reports    \non culture metrics, including reporting on         \nharassment and discrimination allegations. Our     \npolicies provide that, for employees hired on or   \nafter December 11, 2015, unresolved employment     \ndisputes will be addressed through arbitration,    \nwhich we believe is a more efficient, flexible     \nand cost-effective alternative to court for        \nemployee claims to be heard. We do not impose a    \nnon-disclosureor confidentiality requirement on    \nemployees who participate in arbitration, nor      \ndoes arbitration restrict an employee from filing  \na claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity      \nCommission or appropriate state agency. In 2020,   \nand before the law required it, the Company        \neliminated mandatory arbitration for employees in  \nconnection with sexual harassment claims.          \nMoreover, the Company does not include the types   \nof confidentiality clauses identified in the       \nproposal in the agreements employees sign when     \nhired. In the limited circumstances when the       \nCompany may use these types of confidentiality     \nclauses, such as when entering into mutually       \nagreed separation or severance agreements or when  \nresolving claims through a settlement agreement,   \nthe clauses do not prevent an employee from        \nreporting concerns about allegedly inappropriate   \nworkplace conduct to appropriate law enforcement   \nbodies or regulators. Further, our use of          \nconfidentiality clauses for separation,            \nseverance, and settlement agreements is            \ncommonplace as the parties are intending to        \nresolve all claims, and is designed to be          \nconsistent with local law. We believe that our     \npolicies, procedures and practices, as described   \nhere, reflect our commitment to preventing         \nharassment and discrimination. We do not believe   \nthat the proposed annual report would provide      \nmeaningful information to our shareholders to      \nenable them to assess our prevention practices.    \nAdditionally, the report would require a level of  \ndisclosure that is not common practice among our   \npeers or the broader market and could, therefore,  \nbe viewed without the appropriate context or       \nbasis for comparison. Without such comparable      \nmetrics from other companies, the Company could    \nbe subject to increased litigation and             \nreputational risk. Accordingly, we do not believe  \nthat producing the annual report would be a good   \nuse of Company resources or in the best interest   \nof our shareholders. Our Board recommends that     \nyou vote AGAINST this proposal (Item 10).          \n                                                   \n  Item 10 \u2013 Shareholder Proposal \u2013 Annual Report   \n  on                                               \n  Prevention of Workplace Harassment and           \n  Discrimination Our Board recommends that you     \n  vote                                             \n  AGAINST this proposal                            \n                                                   \n                                \n  116    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nShareholder Proposals                              \n                                                   \n  Item 11 Shareholder Proposal \u2013 Policy on         \n  Freedom                                          \n  of Association and Collective Bargaining         \n  AFL-CIO Reserve Fund, 815 Black Lives Matter     \n  Plaza, NW, Washington, DC 20006, the holder of   \n  3,027 shares of common stock has advised us      \n  that                                             \n  it intends to introduce the following            \n  resolution                                       \n  at our annual meeting:                           \n                                                   \n                                                   \nResolution and Supporting Statement                \nRESOLVED: Shareholders urge the                    \nBoard of Directors of Wells Fargo &                \nCompany (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d) to adopt                   \nand publicly disclose a policy on                  \nits commitment to respect the                      \ninternational human rights of                      \nfreedom of association and                         \ncollective bargaining.

In February 2022, Wells Fargo published\n\u201cPriority Recommendations of the Wells Fargo Human \nRights Impact Assessment and Actions in Response\u201d  \nthat summarized a human rights impact assessment   \nperformed by a third party law firm. The           \nrecommendations stated that \u201cWells Fargo should    \nconsider prioritizing the issuance of a            \ncomprehensive human rights policy and providing    \ntraining to the bank\u2019s leadership and senior       \nmanagement regarding the [United Nations Guiding   \nPrinciples on Business and Human Rights].\u201d In      \nresponse to lawmakers\u2019 questions at a U.S. Senate  \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs   \nhearing on September 22, 2022 and a U.S. House     \nCommittee on Financial Services hearing on         \nSeptember 21, 2022, Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf \ndeclined to commit to remain neutral if Wells      \nFargo\u2019s employees seek to unionize. And on June 15,\n2022, an unfair labor practice charge was filed    \nwith the National Labor Relations Board alleging   \nthat Wells Fargo discharged an employee in         \nretaliation for exercising her freedom of          \nassociation rights. 1 We believe this resolution   \nwill also help address human rights risks at Wells \nFargo\u2019s operations in other countries. Wells       \nFargo\u2019s largest international operations are in    \nIndia and the Philippines. The 2022 ITUC Global    \nRights Index rated India and the Philippines as    \ncountries with no guarantee of rights, explaining  \nthat such countries are \u201cthe worst countries in the\nworld to work in. While the legislation may spell  \nout certain rights, workers have effectively no    \naccess to these rights and are therefore exposed to\nautocratic regimes and unfair labour practices.\u201d 2 \nFor these reasons, we urge shareholders to vote FOR\nthis resolution.

In order to allow other shareholders   \nin attendance the ability to ask a question and    \nthe Company to respond to those questions, we may  \nlimit each shareholder to two questions, whether   \nsubmitted prior to or during the annual meeting.   \nShareholder questions that are not pertinent to    \nmeeting matters or the business of the Company,    \nthat relate to personal financial or other         \nmatters, that contain offensive or derogatory      \nlanguage, or that are otherwise out of order and   \nnot appropriate for the conduct of the annual      \nmeeting will not be addressed during the meeting.  \nWe will refer questions related to personal        \nmatters to the appropriate customer service or     \nHuman Resources representative for a response.     \n                               \n  2023 Proxy Statement    123  \n                               \nVoting and Other Meeting Information Shareholder   \nInformation for Future Annual Meetings Shareholder \nProposals and Director Nominations for Inclusion in\nthe Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual Meeting    \nShareholders interested in submitting a proposal   \nfor inclusion in the proxy statement for the       \nCompany\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders in 2024   \nmay do so by following the procedures prescribed in\nSEC Rule 14a-8.To be eligible for inclusion,       \nshareholder proposals must be received either at   \nour principal executive offices at 420 Montgomery  \nStreet, San Francisco, CA 94104 (Attention: Charles\nW.

The Chair or other officer presiding at   \nthe annual meeting has the sole authority to       \ndetermine whether any nomination or other business \nhas been properly brought before the meeting in    \naccordance with our By-Laws.Management and any     \nother person duly named as proxy by a shareholder  \nwill have the authority to vote in their discretion\non any nomination for director or any other        \nbusiness at an annual meeting if the Company does  \nnot receive notice of the nomination or other      \nbusiness matter within the time frames described   \nabove or where a notice is received within these   \ntime frames, if the shareholder delivering the     \nnotice fails to satisfy the requirements of SEC    \nRule 14a-4. In addition, to comply with Rule       \n14a-19,the SEC\u2019s universal proxy rule, if a        \nshareholder intends to solicit proxies in support  \nof director nominees submitted under the advance   \nnotice bylaws for our 2024 annual meeting, then we \nmust receive proper written notice that sets forth \nall the information required by Rule 14a-19under   \nthe Exchange Act to the CEO or Corporate Secretary \nat the addresses above by February 25, 2024 (or, if\nthe 2024 annual meeting is called for a date that  \nis more than 30 days before or more than 30 days   \nafter the first anniversary of this year\u2019s annual  \nmeeting, then notice must be provided no later than\nthe close of business on the later of the 60th day \nprior to the date of the 2024 annual meeting or the\n10th day following the day on which public         \nannouncement of the date of such meeting is first  \nmade by the Company).

We have retained D.F.  \nKing & Co., Inc. to help the Board solicit proxies.\nWe expect to pay approximately $35,000 plus out-of-\npocketexpenses for its help. Members of the Board  \nand our employees may also solicit proxies for us  \nby mail, telephone, e-mail,or in person. We will   \nnot pay our directors or employees any extra       \namounts for soliciting proxies. We may, upon       \nrequest, reimburse brokerage firms, banks, or      \nsimilar entities representing street name holders  \nfor their expenses in forwarding the notice of     \ninternet availability of proxy materials and/or    \nproxy materials to their customers who are street  \nname holders and obtaining their voting            \ninstructions. Electronic Delivery of Proxy         \nMaterials We use the SEC notice and access rule    \nthat allows us to furnish our proxy materials to   \nour shareholders over the internet instead of      \nmailing paper copies of those materials. As a      \nresult, beginning on or about March 15, 2023, we   \nsent to our shareholders of record a notice of     \ninternet availability of proxy materials containing\ninstructions on how to access our proxy materials  \nover the internet and vote online. This notice is  \nnot a proxy card and cannot be used to vote your   \nshares. If you received only a notice, you will not\nreceive paper copies of the proxy materials unless \nyou request the materials by following the         \ninstructions on the notice or on the website       \nreferred to on the notice. We provided some of our \nshareholders, including shareholders who have      \npreviously requested to receive paper copies of the\nproxy materials and some of our shareholders who   \nare participants in our benefit plans, with paper  \ncopies of the proxy materials instead of a notice  \nthat the materials are electronically available    \nover the internet. If you received paper copies of \nthe proxy materials, we encourage you to help us   \nsave money and reduce the environmental impact of  \ndelivering paper proxy materials to shareholders by\nsigning up to receive all of your future proxy     \nmaterials electronically, as described below. If   \nyou own shares of common stock in more than one    \naccount \u2014 for example, in a joint account with your\nspouse and in your individual brokerage account \u2014  \nyou may have received more than one notice or more \nthan one set of paper proxy materials. To vote all \nof your shares by proxy, please follow each of the \nseparate proxy voting instructions that you        \nreceived for your shares of common stock held in   \neach of your different accounts. How to Receive    \nFuture Proxy Materials Electronically Shareholders \ncan sign up to receive proxy materials             \nelectronically and will receive an e-mailprior to  \nnext year\u2019s annual meeting with links to the proxy \nmaterials, which may give them faster delivery of  \nthe materials and will help us save printing and   \nmailing costs and conserve natural resources. Your \nelection to receive proxy materials by e-mailwill  \nremain in effect until you terminate your election.\nTo receive proxy materials by e-mailin the future, \nyou may either go to www.proxyvote.com and follow  \nthe instructions to enroll for electronic delivery \nor follow the instructions on the notice, or if a  \nstreet name holder, contact your brokerage firm,   \nbank, or other similar entity that holds your      \nshares. If you have previously agreed to electronic\ndelivery of our proxy materials, but wish to       \nreceive paper copies of these materials for the    \nannual meeting or for future meetings, please      \nfollow the instructions on the website referred to \non the electronic notice you received. Householding\nSEC rules allow a single copy of the proxy         \nmaterials or the notice of internet availability of\nproxy materials to be delivered to multiple        \nshareholders sharing the same address and last     \nname, or who we reasonably believe are members of  \nthe same family and who consent to receiving a     \nsingle copy of these materials in a manner provided\nby these rules. This practice is referred to as    \n\u201chouseholding\u201d and can result in significant       \nsavings of paper and mailing costs. Because we are \nusing the SEC\u2019s notice and access rule, we will not\nhousehold our proxy materials or notices to        \nshareholders of record sharing an address.

Tangible common equity is  \na non-GAAP financial measure and represents total  \nequity less preferred equity, noncontrolling       \ninterests, goodwill, certain identifiable          \nintangible assets (other than mortgage servicing   \nrights) and goodwill and other intangibles on      \ninvestments in consolidated portfolio companies,   \nnet of applicable deferred taxes. One of these     \nratios is return on average tangible common        \nequity (ROTCE), which represents our annualized    \nearnings as a percentage of tangible common        \nequity. The methodology of determining tangible    \ncommon equity may differ among companies.          \nManagement believes that ROTCE is a useful         \nfinancial measure because it enables management,   \ninvestors, and others to assess the Company\u2019s use  \nof equity. For purposes of measuring performance,  \nas provided in our Long-Term Incentive Plan        \n(LTIP) or the applicable form of award agreement,  \nROTCE may be further adjusted by the Human         \nResources Committee, in its discretion, for the    \neffect of (i) losses resulting from discontinued   \noperations, (ii) the cumulative effect of          \nsignificant changes in generally accepted          \naccounting principles, and (iii) any other         \nunusual or infrequeently occurring gain or loss    \nwhich is separately identified and quantified.     \nUnder the terms of Mr. Scharf\u2019s offer letter,      \nROTCE for purposes of his Performance Shares is    \nadjusted to exclude the impact of any penalties    \nor other charges related to litigation,            \ninvestigations or examinations arising out of      \nretail sales practices of the Company or other     \nmaterial regulatory matters related to the         \nconduct of the Company during periods prior to     \nhis employment. In addition, the HRC believed it   \nwas useful to consider certain notable items that  \noccurred during 2022 and 2021 in order to better   \nassess the Company\u2019s underlying financial          \nperformance for 2022, including as compared with   \n2021. Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Noninterest       \nExpense, Adjusted Pre-TaxProvision Profit,         \nAdjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS,         \nAdjusted ROE, Adjusted ROTCE, and Adjusted         \nEfficiency Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures   \nand represent our reported financial results       \nadjusted for these notable items. We believe that  \nthese adjusted financial measures are useful       \nbecause they enabled the HRC as well as            \nmanagement, investors, and others to better        \nassess the Company\u2019s underlying financial          \nperformance for 2022, particularly for the         \npurposes of analyzing 2022 compensation            \ndecisions. 2022 Notable Items
