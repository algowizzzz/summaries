In particular, forward-looking\nstatements include, but are not limited to, statements we make\nabout our expectations for our operations and business and our\nplans, goals, targets, commitments, objectives, and strategies\n(including those related to environmental, social, and\ngovernance practices, sustainability, and human capital\nmatters). Forward-looking statements are not based on historical\nfacts, but instead represent our current expectations and\nassumptions regarding our business, the economy, and other\nfuture conditions. The inclusion of such statements is not an\nindication that these contents are necessarily material to\ninvestors or required to be disclosed in the Company\u2019s filings\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because forward-\nlooking statements relate to the future, they are subject to\ninherent uncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances that\nare difficult to predict. Actual results may differ materially\nfrom our forward-looking statements due to several factors.\nFactors that could cause our actual results to differ materially\nfrom our forward-looking statements are described in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. We\ncaution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-\nlooking statements. They are neither statements of historical\nfact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Any\nforward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the date\non which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our\nactual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is\nnot possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no\nobligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement,\nwhether as a result of new information, future developments, or\notherwise, and notwithstanding any historical practice of doing\nso, except as may be required by law. In addition, historical,\ncurrent, and forward-looking sustainability-related statements\nmay be based on data, methodologies, or models that are subject\nto measurement uncertainties or other limitations, strategies\nand stakeholder expectations that continue to evolve, and\nassumptions that are subject to change in the future.\n\nReferences throughout this document to websites and our reports,\nincluding our Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024, are provided for convenience only, and the\ncontent on the referenced websites or reports is not\nincorporated by reference into this document.

The\nCompany\u2019s strong performance in 2024 caps a year of significant\nprogress for Wells Fargo across multiple areas. We saw progress\nacross all our businesses, coupled with strong support from our\nclient-facing teams, operations, technology and our corporate\nfunctions. I am grateful to everyone who works at Wells Fargo\nfor all they accomplished this year.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s consistent and significant progress in\ntransforming its culture, plus investments in its core\nbusinesses, translates into continued value for shareholders.\nWells Fargo\u2019s top priority remains building a risk and control\nframework that is appropriate for a bank of our size and\ncomplexity, and the Board continues to oversee this work\nclosely. Our management team has a demonstrated track record of\nprogress in meeting our own high expectations and those of\nregulators, and, while we are not done, we are confident the\nteam will successfully complete the plans that are in place.\n\nAll of this is possible because of our employees. Their\ncommitment to customers, and the ways they model the culture we\nare building, is significant and impressive. The Board is deeply\ngrateful for the value they bring to the Company.\n\nFinally, I want to thank you, our shareholders, for your\ncontinued investment and confidence in Wells Fargo.\n\nSincerely,\n                                                                \n  Steven D.

The Board may, however, approve the\nnomination of a non-management director after the age of 75 if,\ndue to special or unique circumstances, the Board determines\nthat it is in the best interest of our Company and shareholders\nfor the individual to be nominated for election.

Given the significant responsibilities of directors, each\ndirector must be ready, willing, and able to devote sufficient\ntime to carrying out their Board responsibilities effectively.\n\nIn accordance with the Corporate Governance Guidelines, unless\nthe GNC determines that such other board service would not\nimpair the director\u2019s service to the Company, directors may not\nserve as a director on the board of directors of more than four\npublic companies, including the Company, and a director who\nserves as the CEO of a public company may not serve as a\ndirector on the board of directors of more than three public\ncompanies, including the boards of the Company and the company\nof which such director serves as CEO. All of our directors are\nin compliance with this policy.\n\nEffective March 2, 2025, Ronald L. Sargent was appointed interim\nCEO and chair of the board of directors of The Kroger Co., where\nhe previously served as lead director. The board of directors of\nKroger has formed a search committee and engaged a firm to\nconduct a search for Kroger\u2019s permanent CEO. As noted above, Mr.\nSargent remains in compliance with the Board\u2019s policy on outside\nboard service. In accordance with its policy on significant\nchanges in a non-management director\u2019s principal occupation or\nprofessional responsibilities, the Board also evaluated Mr.\nSargent\u2019s appointment, determined that it does not impair his\nservice to Wells Fargo, and requested that Mr. Sargent continue\nto serve on the Board.\n                                                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement7                                         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Board and Governance Matters                                  \n                                                                \nOur Director Nominees\n\nBiographies of our Director Nominees\n\nBiographical information about each of our 13 director nominees\nis set forth below.\n\nFor each nominee, this includes the key qualifications, skills,\nand experience that support the Board\u2019s recommendation that the\nnominee serve as a director of Wells Fargo, as well as on any\ncommittees to which he or she is assigned.\n                                                                \n                                  Steven D.

Each year,\nour Board affirmatively determines the independence of each\ndirector and each nominee for election as a director. Under New\nYork Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) rules, in order for a director to\nbe considered independent, our Board must determine that the\ndirector has no material relationship with our Company (either\ndirectly or as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an\norganization that has a relationship with our Company). To\nassist our Board in making its independence determinations, our\nBoard adopted the Director Independence Standards appended to\nour Corporate Governance Guidelines. These Director Independence\nStandards consist of the NYSE\u2019s \u201cbright line\u201d standards of\nindependence, as well as additional standards, known as\ncategorical standards of independence, adopted by our Board. The\nDirector Independence Standards are available as an appendix to\nour Corporate Governance Guidelines on our website at:\nhttps://www.wellsfargo.com/about/corporate/governance .\n\nBased on the Director Independence Standards, our Board\nconsidered information in early 2025 regarding banking and\nfinancial services, commercial, charitable, familial, and other\nrelationships between each director and director nominee, his or\nher respective immediate family members, and/or certain entities\naffiliated with such directors, director nominees, and immediate\nfamily members, on the one hand, and our Company, on the other,\nto determine the director\u2019s or director nominee\u2019s independence.\nAfter reviewing the information presented to it and considering\nthe recommendation of the GNC, our Board determined that, except\nfor Charles W. Scharf, who is a Wells Fargo employee, all other\ncurrent directors and director nominees are independent under\nthe Director Independence Standards : Steven D. Black, Mark A.\nChancy, Celeste A.

In reviewing and considering any changes to\nthis structure, the Board, including the GNC, would consider the\nstructure that best serves the interests of our shareholders.\n\nAdditionally, 12 of the 13 director nominees are independent\nunder the Director Independence Standards adopted by our Board,\nwhich include the NYSE\u2019s corporate governance rules, and all\nmembers of our standing Board committees are independent.\n\nThe Board has adopted, and annually reviews and approves, well-\ndefined authority and responsibilities of the independent Chair,\nas reflected in the chart below.\n\nKey Areas of Authority/Responsibility of Independent Board Chair\n                                                                \n                                 \u2022Provide input on the          \n                                 composition of the Board and   \n                                 its committees, and selection  \n                                 of committee chairs, so they   \n  Board Composition and          have the diversity of skills   \n  Committee                      and experiences necessary to   \n  Membership                     oversee our risks              \n                                 \u2022Evaluate potential Board      \n                                 candidates along with the      \n                                 Chair of the GNC, and make     \n                                 director candidate             \n                                 recommendations to the GNC     \n                                 \u2022Promote the Board\u2019s           \n  Board Effectiveness            efficient and effective        \n                                 functioning                    \n                                 \u2022Serve as the principal        \n                                 liaison among the independent  \n                                 directors and between the      \n                                 independent directors and the  \n                                 CEO and other members of       \n                                 senior\u00a0management              \n                                 \u2022Facilitate effective          \n  Board Communications and       communication between the      \n  External                       Board and shareholders         \n  Stakeholders                   \u2022Facilitate the Board\u2019s        \n                                 review and consideration of    \n                                 shareholder proposals          \n                                 \u2022Serve as an additional point  \n                                 of contact for the Company\u2019s   \n                                 primary\u00a0regulators             \n                                 \u2022Preside over each annual      \n                                 meeting of shareholders        \n  Advisory Role                  \u2022Serve as an advisor to the    \n                                 CEO                            \n                                 \u2022Participate, along with       \n  CEO Performance Evaluation     other directors, in the        \n                                 performance evaluation of the  \n                                 CEO                            \n                                 \u2022Set the ethical tone for the  \n  Ethics and Culture             Board and reinforce a strong   \n                                 ethical culture                \n                                 \u2022Lead the Board\u2019s review of    \n                                 the Company\u2019s strategic        \n  Company Strategy               initiatives and plans and      \n                                 discuss the implementation of  \n                                 those initiatives and plans    \n                                 with the CEO                   \n                                                                \nAnnual Chair Selection\n\nOur Board\u2019s GNC is responsible for periodically evaluating our\nBoard\u2019s leadership structure, and based on the GNC\u2019s\nrecommendation, our Board selects the Chair annually. If re-\nelected at the 2025 Annual Meeting, Mr. Black will continue to\nserve as our independent Chair, a role he has held since August\n2021. The Board believes his significant experience in senior\nleadership roles managing strategy and risk at financial\ninstitutions assists in providing appropriate oversight over\nmanagement\u2019s execution of its risk and control strategy.\n                                                                \n  24Wells Fargo & Company                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Board and Governance Matters                                  \n                                                                \nOur Board Committee Structure\n\nStanding Board Committees\n\nOur Board has standing committees that act on behalf of the\nBoard and report on their activities to the entire Board.\n                                                       \n                      Governance    Human              \n  Audit    Finance    &             Resources    Risk  \n                      Nominating                       \n                                                       \nEach committee may form and delegate, in its discretion, all or\na portion of its authority to subcommittees of one or more of\nits members. In 2024, the Credit Subcommittee was reintegrated\ninto the Risk Committee. In January 2025, our Board approved the\nintegration of the responsibilities of the CRC into our GNC\u2019s\nresponsibilities and related dissolution of the CRC. See\nCorporate R esponsibility Committee below.\n\nFrom time to time, the Board may form special purpose committees\nto which the Board may delegate responsibility for oversight of\nparticular matters.\n\nCommittee Composition\n\nThe Board appoints the members and chair of each committee based\non the recommendation of the GNC.\n\nAs part of this process, the GNC annually reviews the committee\nstructure, committee assignments, and chair positions and\nrecommends to the Board the assignment of Board members to\nvarious committees. The Board does not favor mandatory rotation\nof committee assignments or chair positions because it believes\nthat experience and continuity are important for the effective\noperation of the Board\u2019s committees. The GNC may recommend\nchanges to committee membership based on committee needs,\ndirector experience and interest, and to provide for a\nsuccession plan for a committee chair.\n\nThe GNC also reviews each director nominee\u2019s qualifications and\nexperience as it evaluates the composition of each committee in\nlight of the particular committee\u2019s oversight responsibilities.\nThe collective qualifications and experience of the nominees who\nsit on each committee are noted below under Board Committee\nMembers and Oversight Responsibilities .\n\nEach of our Board\u2019s standing committees is composed entirely of\nindependent directors. Each member of these committees in 2024\nwas independent and fulfilled the requirements applicable to\neach committee on which he or she served.\n\nCommittee Charters\n\nEach Board committee\u2019s charter is available on our website at:\nhttps://www.wellsfargo.com/about/corporate/governance/ .\n\nAs required by its charter, each of our committees annually\nreviews and assesses its charter\u2019s adequacy, reviews its\nperformance, and is responsible for overseeing reputation risk\nrelated to its responsibilities.\n                                                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement25                                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Board and Governance Matters                                  \n                                                                \nBoard Committee Members and Oversight Responsibilities\n\nOur Board committees and their primary responsibilities are\ndescribed below. Assuming they are re-elected at the Annual\nMeeting, effective April 29, 2025, Richard Davis and CeCe Morken\nwill become members of the GNC and Mr. Davis will become the\nChair of the GNC, and Wayne Hewett will rotate from the GNC to\nthe Finance Committee and Mr. Hewett will become Chair of the\nFinance Committee.

( WFBNA ) is composed of\ndirectors Chancy, Craver, Davis (Chair), Morken, Morris, and\nScharf. WFBNA\u2019s board of directors (the Bank Board ) held eight\nregular meetings and one special meeting in 2024.\n\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\n\nIn 2024, Steven D. Black, Wayne M. Hewett, Maria R. Morris, and\nRonald L. Sargent served as members of the HRC. During 2024, no\nmember of the HRC was an employee, officer, or former officer of\nthe Company. None of our executive officers served in 2024 on\nthe board of directors or compensation committee (or other\ncommittee serving an equivalent function) of any entity that had\nan executive officer serving as a member of our Board or the\nHRC. As described under the Related Person Transactions section\nof this Proxy Statement, in 2024, some HRC members had banking\nor financial services transactions in the ordinary course of\nbusiness with our banking and other subsidiaries.\n\nDirector Engagement\n\nBoard and Committee Meetings; Annual Meeting Attendance\n\nDirectors are expected to attend all Board meetings and meetings\nof committees on which they serve, and each annual shareholder\nmeeting. All of our current directors attended our Company\u2019s\n2024 annual meeting.\n\nOur Board held eight regular meetings and one special meeting\nduring 2024. Attendance by our Board\u2019s current directors at\nmeetings of our Board and its committees (including\nsubcommittees) averaged more than 99% during 2024.\n\nOur Board met in executive session without management present\nduring nearly all of its 2024 regular board meetings. As\ndescribed in the Our Board Leadership Structure section of this\nProxy Statement, the independent Board Chair, Steven D. Black,\nchairs executive sessions of the non-management and independent\ndirectors. Committee meetings include executive sessions led by\nthe respective independent committee chair.\n\nDirector Engagement Beyond the Boardroom\n\nIn addition to preparing for and participating in frequent Board\nand committee meetings, our directors engage with key internal\nand external stakeholders. Through these interactions, they gain\nvaluable insights and share perspectives relevant to our\nbusiness and the oversight of our strategy and risks.\n

Topics reviewed generally\ninclude Board performance and effectiveness, Board composition,\nBoard leadership structure, and training and orientation. Our\nBoard\u2019s annual self-evaluation also is a component of its\ndirector nomination process and succession planning.\n\nDesigning the Evaluation Process\n\nThe GNC, in consultation with our independent Board Chair,\nreviews and determines the overall process, scope, and content\nof our Board\u2019s annual self-evaluation process. The GNC has\ncontinued to enhance the Board\u2019s self-evaluation process based\non director feedback, best practices, experience, and regulatory\nexpectations.\n\nThird-Party Assistance\n\nIn 2024, we engaged a third party to facilitate the Board's\nself-evaluation.\n\nEach year, the GNC considers whether to engage a third party to\nassist the Board in conducting its self-evaluation. The process\nfor 2024 included individual interviews with each of the\ndirectors by the third-party facilitator, individual\nconversations with our independent Board Chair and each\ncommittee chair, and discussions of the results of the Board and\ncommittee self-evaluations with the Board.\n\nBoard Self-Evaluation Process\n\nThe following chart reflects the key components of the

In support of this:\n\n\u2022 At each of the eight regularly scheduled Board meetings in\n2024, the meeting included a discussion of significant risk and\nregulatory matters with senior executives, including our CEO,\nCFO, CRO, COO, Chief Auditor, and General Counsel.\n\n\u2022 The Board, either directly or through its committees,\nperiodically receives updates from line of business CEOs and\nenterprise function heads, which include significant risks and\nissues relevant to the business group or enterprise function.\nThe Board also receives reports from its standing committees at\neach regular Board meeting.\n\n\u2022 The Board receives Independent Risk Management\u2019s evaluation of\nrisks that may be associated with the Company\u2019s strategic plan\nwhen the Board reviews and approves the Company\u2019s strategic\nplan.\n\n\u2022 The Board meets annually with its primary bank regulators, and\nthe independent Chair of our Board and the chairs of certain of\nits committees, as well as the chair of the Bank Board, meet\nindividually with our bank regulators.\n\n\u2022 Our independent Board Chair Steven D. Black has extensive risk\nmanagement experience. He engages with our regulators,\nshareholders, and others, seeks to incorporate risk and\nregulatory topics in regular discussions between the Board and\nmanagement, and provides input on the composition of the Board\nand its committees so that each has the diversity of skills and\nexperiences necessary to oversee our risks.\n\nRole of Board Committees\n\nThe Board carries out its risk oversight responsibilities\nthrough its committees. Each Board committee is responsible for\noverseeing risks within its purview. All of our standing Board\ncommittees, which are comprised solely of independent directors,\nreport to the Board about their activities, including risk\noversight-related matters. Each Board committee has defined\nauthority and responsibilities for primary oversight of specific\nrisks, as outlined in its respective charter, and works closely\nwith management to understand and oversee our Company\u2019s key\nrisks. Each Board committee may delegate certain of its\noversight responsibilities to a subcommittee to assist in its\nduties.\n\nIn addition to the risk oversight structure at the parent level,\nthe board of directors of the Company\u2019s principal banking\nsubsidiary, WFBNA, has established the Regulatory Compliance\nOversight Committee ( RCOC ) and the BSA/AML Compliance\nCommittee ( BACC ). The RCOC and BACC each oversee compliance\nwith certain regulatory consent orders and other enforcement\nactions for which oversight has been delegated by either the\nBoard or the Bank Board.\n                                                                \n  34Wells Fargo & Company                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Board and Governance Matters                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Board Oversight                                               \n  The Board                                                     \n  oversees                                                      \n  significant                                                   \n  risks,                                                        \n  including                                                     \n  financial risks,                                              \n  such as                                                       \n  interest rate,                                                \n  credit,                                                       \n  liquidity, and                                                \n  market risks, and                                             \n  non-financial                                                 \n  risks,                                                        \n  such as                                                       \n  operational                                                   \n  (which includes                                               \n  compliance and                                                \n  model risks),                                                 \n  strategic                                                     \n  and reputation                                                \n  risks.

We\nexpect our employees to speak up when they see something that\ncould cause harm to our customers, communities, employees,\nshareholders, or reputation. Because we believe risk management\nis everyone\u2019s responsibility, our employees are empowered and\nexpected to challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to\nescalate their concerns. Employees are also required to complete\nannual risk training, and top leaders meet in person to\nparticipate in training designed to help equip leaders to drive\na strong risk culture.\n                                                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement37                                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Board and Governance Matters                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n   Human Capital Management                                     \n                                                                \nAt Wells Fargo, we strive to be a great place to work where our\nemployees can grow meaningful careers. We leverage employee\nfeedback to enhance the employee experience and drive\nimprovements to our culture and processes. Employees are invited\nto share their thoughts through surveys, town halls, direct\nengagement between managers and employees, and leader-led\nsessions. Employees also submit ideas through our employee\nfeedback platform called Loudspeaker, and some of these ideas\nhave been implemented in recent years, leading to efficiencies,\ninnovation, and greater employee engagement. We conduct various\nsurveys throughout the year, including our annual Global\nEmployee Survey. The surveys are a way for employees to share\ntheir candid thoughts and feedback. Senior leadership and our\ndirectors analyze employee feedback, as shared in the Global\nEmployee Survey results, to help the Company improve the\nemployee experience, workplace engagement, and the way we do\nbusiness.\n\nAs reflected in our policies and practices, we believe all of\nour employees should be free from harassment and discrimination.\nWells Fargo provides multiple avenues for employees to raise\nconcerns, including on an anonymous basis. Wells Fargo prohibits\nretaliation of any kind against anyone for providing information\nin good faith or otherwise in accordance with applicable\ncountry-specific laws. Several Company policies and procedures\ncomprise our overall\nanti-harassment and anti-discrimination framework, including\nour:\n\n\u2022 Code of Conduct, which applies to all employees, including\nexecutive officers, and, as applicable, our independent\ndirectors;\n\n\u2022 Anti-harassment and discrimination policy, which applies\nbroadly to all Wells Fargo employees, covers conduct both inside\nand outside the workplace, and encourages and sets the\nexpectation that all employees should report any concerns\nrelated to harassment or discrimination; and\n\n\u2022 Speak Up and Nonretaliation Policy, which requires employees\nto speak up and report potential misconduct \u2013 including\nharassment, discrimination, or retaliation \u2013 using any of the\nreporting channels listed in the Code of Conduct, and reiterates\nthat we prohibit retaliation for filing a complaint, assisting\nor participating in an investigation, inquiring about or\ndiscussing one\u2019s own pay or the pay of another employee or\napplicant, opposing any unlawful act or discriminatory practice,\nor exercising any rights protected under applicable laws and\nregulations.\n\nAs part of our commitment to health and well-being, Wells Fargo\noffers eligible full- and part-time employees and eligible\ndependents a comprehensive set of benefits designed to support\nphysical, financial, and emotional health. The Company\ncontributes up to 87% of U.S. employees\u2019 per-paycheck cost of\nmedical coverage in 2025. Employees, spouses, and domestic\npartners enrolled in certain U.S. medical plans can earn up to\n$1,200 in health and wellness dollars for completing specified\nwellness-related activities. In addition, employees earning up\nto $100,000 and enrolled in certain U.S. medical plans receive\nautomatic funding in a health savings account. Through the\nEmployee Assistance Program (EAP), U.S. employees and eligible\ndependents have access to six free in-person or virtual\ncounseling sessions per issue, up to a maximum of 12 sessions\nper calendar year. We offer eligible U.S. employees family\nsupport through fertility and adoption programs, and up to 16\nweeks of paid parental leave available on day one.\n\nWe support financial health by offering market-competitive base\nsalary and incentive compensation programs. Eligible U.S. 401(k)\nplan participants with one year of service receive a dollar-for-\ndollar Company match of up to 6% of eligible compensation and\nemployees earning less than $75,000 also receive a Company\n401(k) non-matching contribution of 1% of eligible compensation.\nWe offer U.S. employees up to $5,000 annually ($2,500 for part-\ntime employees) for tuition reimbursement for eligible external\nprograms.\n\nWe remain focused on customer experience and customer fairness.\nIn recognition of our employees\u2019 work to help our customers,\nstrengthen our communities, and create value for our\nstakeholders, while building a stronger Wells Fargo for the\nlong-term, a special cash payment was awarded for more than\n90,000 employees globally. This payment was $1,100 for U.S.\nemployees who met certain eligibility requirements, including\nperformance and compensation limits. Eligible employees outside\nof the United States received a payment adjusted for local\nlevels.\n\nWe have conducted an annual pay equity review, evaluating both\nbase salary and total compensation, through engagement with a\nthird-party consultant for a number of years. The pay equity\nreview compares compensation across the enterprise, taking into\naccount factors such as role, level, tenure and geography and we\nmay make adjustments in the event the review identifies\nunexplained gaps. As with last year\u2019s review, the year-end 2024\nreview showed no significant unexplained pay gaps.\n                                                                \n  38Wells Fargo & Company                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Board and Governance Matters                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n   Compensation Risk Management                                 \n                                                                \nThe Board plays an important role in overseeing the Company\u2019s\nperformance management and incentive compensation programs\nthrough its HRC.

The results of these risk assessments,\nand associated compensation recommendations, are reviewed by a\nmanagement governance committee reporting to the HRC, and\nsupporting steering committees, as described below. Final\nvariable incentive compensation decisions are shared with the\nHRC, along with the risk assessment results, as part of the\nHRC\u2019s oversight of the Company\u2019s Incentive Compensation Risk\nManagement policy and programs.\n                                                                \n                                  The IPC is a management       \n                                  governance committee          \n                                  reporting to the HRC.

Since 2021, the HRC made several significant\nenhancements to our executive compensation program based on\nfeedback from shareholders, including pay structure (e.g.,\nincreased the percentage of CEO pay delivered as Performance\nShare Awards ( PSAs ); reintroduced relative Return on Tangible\nCommon Equity ( ROTCE ) performance) and disclosure (e.g., the\nperformance assessment process used by the HRC, including their\npay determination process), which have resulted in strong\nsupport for the Company\u2019s pay program.\n                                 \n  2024 Say on Pay Proposal Vote  \n  92.7% support                  \n                                 \nSelect members of our Board and management engage in direct\nconversations with our largest institutional investors\nthroughout the year, and we rely on these engagement sessions to\nunderstand shareholder perspectives and respond to their\nquestions regarding the design and administration of our\nexecutive compensation program. We value shareholder feedback,\nand key themes are shared with the Board. Shareholders continued\nto generally express support for and understanding of our\ncurrent executive compensation structure and its alignment to\nadvancing our strategic priorities. For more information, see\n2024 Say on Pay Vote and Shareholder Engagement .\n\nWells Fargo continues to make progress on our multi-year\ntransformation journey. We remain focused on our top priority of\nbuilding a risk and control infrastructure appropriate for a\ncompany of our size and complexity. The scale and volume of the\nwork is complex, and we are proud of the continued progress that\nwe have made over the past few years.\n\nSuccess requires that we pay for performance, promote effective\nrisk management, and attract and retain talent. The HRC\naccomplishes these objectives by overseeing an executive\ncompensation program and the underlying variable compensation\nstrategies that are grounded in and reflective of shareholder\nfeedback and our Labor Market Peer Group practices. The HRC\nfurther enhances the effectiveness of our variable compensation\nstrategies through oversight and governance reflecting our\ncommitment to integrating sound risk management disciplines as\npart of the performance management assessment and compensation\ndetermination processes.\n\nThe 2024 Say on Pay advisory vote on executive compensation\nreceived approximately 92.7% support, reflecting shareholder\nsupport of the HRC\u2019s decisions on variable incentive\ncompensation design. The majority of our executives\u2019 total\ncompensation is delivered in the form of long-term equity,\nconsisting of PSAs and restricted share rights ( RSRs ), as\ndetailed within the CD&A. Our executive compensation program is\ndesigned to hold our executives accountable for all aspects of\nthe Company\u2019s performance, including making progress towards the\nrisk and control work which is the top priority for Wells Fargo,\nwhile continuing to deliver strong financial returns for our\nshareholders and supporting our customers, clients, and\nemployees.\n                                                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement43                                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Executive Compensation                                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  What We Do                      What We Don\u2019t Do              \n  Incentive compensation is                                     \n  variable and                    No cash dividends on          \n  \u201cat-risk\u201d and equity            unearned RSRs and PSAs        \n  compensation covers                                           \n  multi-year vesting periods                                    \n                                  No pledging of Company        \n  Focus on risk management and    securities by directors or    \n  risk                            executive officers under the  \n  outcomes                        Board\u2019s Corporate Governance  \n                                  Guidelines                    \n  Overall performance                                           \n  evaluated through a             No executive employment       \n  rigorous performance            agreements                    \n  assessment                                                    \n  framework                                                     \n  Engage independent                                            \n  compensation                    No tax gross-ups for NEOs     \n  consultant                                                    \n                                  No additional retirement      \n                                  benefits or additional years  \n  Strong and independent Board    of\u00a0credited service other     \n  oversight                       than investment or interest   \n  through the Board\u2019s HRC         credits\u00a0provided under        \n                                  applicable pension plans      \n                                  since July\u00a01, 2009            \n  Recoupment policies provide                                   \n  for clawback                                                  \n  and forfeiture of               No repricing of stock         \n  compensation in                 options without shareholder\u00a0  \n  appropriate circumstances,      approval                      \n  including                                                     \n  misconduct and risk                                           \n  management failure                                            \n  Stock Ownership Policy                                        \n  includes minimum                                              \n  ownership requirements, a       No hedging of Company         \n  compliance                      securities by directors,      \n  period to reach requirement,    executive officers, or other  \n  and                             employees under our Code of   \n  additional holding              Conduct                       \n  requirements that                                             \n  extend one year after                                         \n  retirement                                                    \n  Year-round engagement with                                    \n  shareholders                    No excessive perquisites for  \n  on executive compensation       executive officers            \n  and governance                                                \n  issues                                                        \n                                                                \n2024 Performance Highlights\n\nDuring 2024, the Company delivered strong performance. We\ncontinued to improve the Company\u2019s earnings capacity through\nincreased fee revenue and a focus on efficiency, while also\nincreasing capital return to shareholders. We grew net income\nand diluted earnings per share, and we continued to reduce\nexpenses and focus on our efficiency initiatives. Our\ndisciplined approach to managing expense levels has been\nconsistent and an important part of our success.\n\nWe have made continued progress in strengthening the Company\u2019s\nrisk and control infrastructure in 2024, with the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) terminating a consent order\nit issued in 2016 regarding sales practices. In the first\nquarter of 2025, our 2022 consent order with the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau terminated, the Federal Reserve\nBoard of Governors terminated two longstanding consent orders,\nand the OCC terminated a 2018 consent order related to the\nCompany\u2019s compliance risk management program. The closure of\nthese consent orders reflect our continued discipline in\nmanaging regulatory commitments and is another indication that\nour team is establishing the right processes and controls to\nmeet our regulators\u2019 and our own expectations.\n\nWe continued to advance our business strategy, including making\ninvestments in our core businesses. We are starting to see\nimproved growth and increased market share in parts of the\nCompany that we believe will drive higher returns over time. For\nexample, while maintaining our credit standards, our credit card\nproducts generated over 2.4 million new accounts in 2024. The\nmomentum in this business is also demonstrated by strong credit\ncard spend, up over $17 billion in 2024 from the prior year. We\ncontinued to make investments in talent and technology to\nstrengthen CIB, which led to increased U.S. market share in\ninvestment banking with share gains in debt and equity capital\nmarkets and increased revenue in our advisory business in 2024.\nFinally, we continued enhancing the Wells Fargo Mobile\u00ae app for\ncustomers and saw meaningful growth: over 40% of consumer\nchecking accounts were opened digitally; mobile active customers\ngrew by 1.5 million, up 5% from the prior year; and over $1\nbillion in Zelle sales transactions was realized, up 22% from\nthe prior year. We also previously introduced Wells Fargo\nPremier to better serve our affluent clients, and we are\nstarting to see early benefits from the enhancements.\n                                                                \n  44Wells Fargo & Company                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Executive Compensation                                        \n                                                                \nIn addition, we continued to streamline and right-size the\nCompany, which included opportunities to exit or sell businesses\nthat are not in line with our long-term strategic priorities. In\n2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the non-\nagency third-party servicing segment of our Commercial Mortgage\nServicing business. We continued to execute on a focused Home\nLending strategy that has resulted in a more profitable business\nand opportunities remain to improve.\n\nPlease refer to 202 4 Company Performance for more details about\nthe Company\u2019s financial performance and how it was considered in\nthe HRC\u2019s 2024 compensation decisions for the NEOs.\n\nPerformance and Compensation Determination Process\n\nConsistent with prior years, the HRC followed a systematic\napproach to set goals, to evaluate Company, individual, and as\napplicable, line of business performance, and to determine\nexecutive compensation.

In 2024, the\nHRC increased target total compensation for Mr. Santomassimo and\nMr. Weiss, reflecting the HRC\u2019s evaluation of market pay levels\nand for Mr. Santomassimo, a review of his performance and\nresponsibilities. Target total compensation for Mr. Rivas and\nMs. Engle were established by the HRC in connection with their\nhiring. Due to the timing of Mr. Rivas\u2019 and Ms. Engle\u2019s\nrespective hire dates, and per the terms of our compensation\nprogram, their target variable compensation was not prorated for\n2024. Target total compensation remained unchanged from 2023 for\nMr. Scharf.\n\nPay Mix\n\nAll members of the Operating Committee, including NEOs other\nthan the CEO, have a consistent variable compensation pay mix,\nwith 70% of variable compensation delivered as long-term equity.\nThe CEO has a higher percentage, with a minimum of 75% of his\nvariable compensation delivered as long-term equity.\n\nPay-for-Performance Outcomes\n\nThroughout 2024, the HRC periodically assessed the Company\u2019s\nperformance. During the fourth quarter of 2024 and in January\n2025, the HRC completed in-depth reviews of all aspects of the\nCompany\u2019s financial and non-financial performance, and\nindividual NEO performance.\n\nIn January 2025, the Board and the HRC approved the following\n2024 compensation outcomes after assessing performance for our\nCEO and other NEOs, respectively.

The table above includes only direct elements\nof compensation (salary, annual cash bonus, and the January 28,\n2025 approved value of PSAs and RSRs) and does not include the\nindirect elements (change in pension value and non-qualified\ndeferred compensation), as reported in the 2024 Summary\nCompensation Table. Also, the table above reports equity for the\nperformance year earned. In conformance with SEC requirements,\nthe 2024 Summary Compensation Table in this Proxy Statement\nreports equity in the year granted, but cash awards for the year\nearned.\n\n1.

In 2024,\npartially in response to shareholder feedback, the HRC made\nadjustments to our Financial Performance Peer Group, as detailed\nlater in Peer Groups . In addition, the HRC increased the target\nperformance goal required for three-year average absolute ROTCE\nperformance to achieve target payout (refer to 202 5 PSA Program\nfor details).\n\nSince our 2024 annual meeting, we engaged with institutional\ninvestors representing approximately 58% of outstanding shares.\nFor more information about our discussions with shareholders\nfollowing the 2024 annual meeting and our Board\u2019s perspective,\nsee Shareholder Engagement .\n                                                              \n  Total contacted                Total engaged                \n  61%                            58%                          \n  of total outstanding shares    of total outstanding shares  \n                                                              \nThe Board receives periodic updates from the HRC on key themes\nof shareholder feedback received during shareholder engagement,\nincluding input related to our executive compensation program.\n                                                                \n  46Wells Fargo & Company                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Executive Compensation                                        \n                                                                \n2024 Executive Compensation Program\n\n2024 Pay for Performance Philosophy and Framework\n\nExecutive Compensation Principles\n\nThe Company\u2019s executive compensation program is designed and\nadministered in accordance with the following compensation\nprinciples, each of which is an essential component to driving\nstrong, risk-managed performance.\n                                                                \n  Pay for              Promote Effective     Attract and        \n  Performance          Risk Management       Retain Talent      \n  Compensation is                            People are one of  \n  linked to                                  the Company\u2019s      \n  Company,                                   competitive        \n  individual, and,                           advantages;        \n  as applicable,       Compensation          therefore,         \n  line of              promotes effective    compensation       \n  business             risk\u00a0management       helps attract,     \n  performance, and     and discourages       motivate, and      \n  creating             imprudent or          retain people      \n  long-term value      excessive             with the skills,   \n  consistent with      risk-taking.          talent, and        \n  the                                        experience to      \n  interests of                               drive superior     \n  shareholders.                              long-term Company  \n                                             performance.       \n                                                                \nThe HRC oversees the design and administration of our executive\ncompensation program, which includes a rigorous and iterative\nassessment process that takes place throughout the year.

While several companies are\nincluded in both peer groups, each peer group serves a separate\nand distinct purpose.\n\n\u2022 The Labor Market Peer Group includes our most direct\ncompetitors for executive talent, a proxy for industry\ncompensation policies and practices, and an input for setting\nquantum of pay and pay mix. The HRC relies on this group, and\nguidance from Meridian, the independent compensation consultant,\nto develop an understanding of market compensation pay levels\nfor executives in comparable roles, in addition to executive pay\npractices including program design and pay mixes. The HRC\nassesses peer pay levels in connection with its annual review of\nNEO compensation.\n\n\u2022 The Financial Performance Peer Group includes companies that\nmost closely align with our size, complexity, capital\nrequirements, and degree of regulatory oversight (all are Global\nSystemically Important Banks ( G-SIBs )). The HRC\u2019s approach in\nevaluating and selecting this peer group\u2019s constituents reflects\nits desire to create a fair and balanced relative performance\nstandard. It is characterized by a wide range of performance\noutcomes that drive pay-for-performance without leading to\nexcessive risk-taking that overly aggressive goals otherwise\nmight create and without reducing or eliminating the perceived\nvalue of PSAs, which we rely on to help us attract and retain\nour executives. The HRC relies on this group to assess our\nrelative performance for assessing Company financial performance\nin connection with its annual variable compensation decisions\nand in calculating formulaic PSA payouts.\n                                                                \n                                 2024             2025          \n  Company        Labor Market    Financial        Financial     \n                 Peer Group      Performance      Performance   \n                                 Peer Group       Peer Group    \n  American                                                      \n  Express                                                       \n  Banco                                                         \n  Santander,                                                    \n  S.A.*                                                         \n  Bank of                                                       \n  America*                                                      \n  Barclays                                                      \n  PLC*                                                          \n  BNY*                                                          \n  BNP Paribas                                                   \n  S.A.*                                                         \n  Citigroup                                                     \n  Inc.*                                                         \n  Goldman                                                       \n  Sachs*                                                        \n  HSBC                                                          \n  Holdings                                                      \n  plc*                                                          \n  JPMorgan                                                      \n  Chase*                                                        \n  Morgan                                                        \n  Stanley*                                                      \n  PNC                                                           \n  Royal Bank                                                    \n  of Canada*                                                    \n  State                                                         \n  Street*                                                       \n  UBS Group                                                     \n  AG*                                                           \n  US Bancorp                                                    \n                                                                \n* G-SIBs\n\nThe HRC assesses the appropriateness of the peer groups each\nyear, with input from Meridian. As part of the shareholder\nengagement process, we also received shareholder feedback on our\nFinancial Performance Peer Group. For 2024, the HRC reviewed the\nFinancial Performance Peer Group and considered several factors\nsuch as business model, risk profiles and regulatory framework,\nincluding the impact on capital and liquidity across the banks.\nFollowing the review, the HRC removed three non-U.S. banks\n(Royal Bank of Canada, Banco Santander, S.A., and BNP Paribas\nS.A.) from the 2025 Financial Performance Peer Group, for awards\ngranted in 2025 for performance year 2024, to increase focus on\ndomestic financial institutions and more closely align with how\nour primary domestic peers identify their peer institutions. The\nHRC also evaluated adding certain U.S. regional banks to the\nFinancial Performance Peer Group, but determined that it\nremained appropriate to include only G-SIBs due to differences\nin capital and liquidity rules and business mix.\n\nThe HRC did not change the Labor Market Peer Group for 2024. The\nLabor Market peer constituents continue to represent the\nfinancial services organizations with whom we compete most\ndirectly for executive talent.\n                                                                \n  48Wells Fargo & Company                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Executive Compensation                                        \n                                                                \nPay-for-Performance Compensation Structure for our CEO and other\nNEOs\n\nVariable compensation for our CEO and other NEOs is performance-\nbased and at risk and is delivered through an annual cash bonus\nand long-term equity.

                          \nPerformance Assessment and Variable Compensation Determination\nProcess\n\n2024 Process\n\nThe HRC assesses NEO performance through evaluation against pre-\nestablished financial and non-financial goals. This includes\nconsideration of financial results and progress against\nstrategic priorities, providing the flexibility to assess both\nquantitative and qualitative results. This process aligns\nvariable compensation determinations with performance against\nthe Company\u2019s long-term value drivers and prudent risk oversight\nand provides the HRC with the ability to reduce an individual\nNEO\u2019s performance achievement level for material failures in\nrisk management, including but not limited to misconduct. The\nHRC believes that using a single formula to evaluate performance\nand determine compensation is not practical and may not fully\nreflect the scope and complexity of our business and the\nregulatory risks and other non-financial outcomes that impact\nour Company success. This rigorous process enables the HRC to\nevaluate Company, CEO, and each of our other NEO\u2019s overall\nperformance, which serves as the basis for compensation\ndecisions, as described in more detail below.\n\n1 Set Goals\n\nOur Board sets our strategic direction and risk appetite,\nincluding approval of our strategic plan annually, which\nincludes our five strategic pillars. The five strategic pillars\nare used to frame the goals the HRC uses to assess Company,\nindividual, and, as applicable, line of business performance.\nThree of the strategic pillars \u2013 Risk and Control Culture,\nOperational Excellence, and Customer-Centric Culture and Conduct\n\u2013 focus on advancing our risk and control culture, supported by\nTechnology and Innovation (4th pillar), to collectively drive\nour top priority of building a risk and control infrastructure\nappropriate for our size and complexity, and Financial Strength\n(5th pillar).\n\nAt the beginning of each year, individual NEO goals are set\ntailored to their area of responsibility with a focus on\nsupporting broader Company goals. For 2024, consistent with\n2023, the strategic pillars, Company, and individual NEO goals\nare broadly categorized below:\n                                                                \n  Strategic Pillars    Company Goals        Individual/Line of  \n                                            Business1Goals      \n                       \u2022Risk,                                   \n                       Regulatory, &                            \n  \u2022Risk & Control      Control              \u2022Risk, Regulatory,  \n  Culture              \u2022Financial           & Control           \n  \u2022Operational         \u2022Operational         \u2022Financial          \n  Excellence           Excellence           \u2022Strategy,          \n  \u2022Customer-Centric    \u2022Customer-Centric    Technology, &\u00a0      \n  Culture &\u00a0Conduct    Culture &\u00a0Conduct    innovation          \n  \u2022Technology &        \u2022Technology &        \u2022Talent,            \n  Innovation           Innovation           Leadership, &       \n  \u2022Financial           \u2022Community           Culture             \n  Strength             Engagement                               \n                       \u2022Talent &                                \n                       Leadership                               \n                                                                \n1. Line of Business Goals are included for CEOs of each business\nline.\n\n2 Evaluate Performance\n\nThe HRC assesses performance holistically and regularly monitors\nand reviews Company performance throughout the year. At the end\nof the year, the HRC (and the Board for the CEO) assesses\nCompany and individual NEO performance against the financial and\nnon-financial goals set at the beginning of the year, in\naddition to risk performance informed by the CRO (see\nIndependent Risk Assessment below for details) and feedback from\nInternal Audit. The outcome of the performance evaluation is\ndirectly used to determine NEO variable compensation.\n\nSimilar to prior years, the HRC focused on our NEOs\u2019 progress\nin: strengthening our risk and control infrastructure, which\nincludes addressing open historical and emerging issues; and\nadvancing our business through technology and innovation to\nincrease internal operational efficiency so we can deploy\nresources to better serve our customers and communities. We\nanticipate that the HRC\u2019s focus on these two areas will continue\nfor the foreseeable future to help drive the Company\u2019s\ntransformation.\n                                                                \n  50Wells Fargo & Company                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Executive Compensation                                        \n                                                                \nHRC\u2019s Evaluation Process:\n                                                                \n  CEO                                                           \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                             The HRC approves   \n  The CEO completes    The HRC assesses      CEO compensation   \n  a self-assessment    the CEO's             with a             \n  of                   performance in an     recommendation to  \n  his performance      executive session     the Board.

During this process, the CRO assesses\nthe extent of each NEO\u2019s (other than the CEO) involvement in and\naccountability (if any) related to risk events that took place,\nor were identified, during the year. For the CEO, the HRC\nconducts a risk review with input from the Risk Committee Chair\n(who is also a member of the HRC), as well as the CRO. Further,\neach NEO is assessed on driving measurable progress toward\nadvancing the Company\u2019s risk and control environment, which\nincludes resolving outstanding regulatory matters and\ncommitments.

The Company maintained disciplined expense management\nthrough efficiency initiatives, including reducing headcount by\n4%. The Company returned approximately $25 billion of capital to\nour shareholders, including repurchasing $20 billion of common\nstock, up 64% from the prior year, and increasing the common\nstock dividend per share by 15%.\n\nThe Company also made significant progress on key non-financial\nareas, including continuing to strengthen the risk and control\ninfrastructure, investing in new products and services to better\nserve our customers and advance our business strategy, and\nsupporting the communities we serve, including donations to\nnonprofits in support of housing, small business, financial\nhealth, sustainability and other community needs.\n\nThe HRC considered key financial and non-financial performance\ncriteria in evaluating 2024 Company performance as detailed\nwithin the Financial Performance and Non-Financial Performance\nsections below.\n                                                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement53                                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Executive Compensation                                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n   Financial Performance                                        \n                                                                \nBelow are the key financial results reviewed by the HRC, which\ntogether with our non-financial results (discussed below)\ninformed the HRC\u2019s assessment of Company performance as an input\ninto the compensation outcomes for 2024.

Due to his\nretirement, and consistent with past practices for retiring\nexecutives, the HRC determined that 100% of Mr. Weiss\u2019 long-term\nequity compensation would be paid in the form of RSRs for 2024.\n                                                                \n  2024 Total Variable Compensation                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                \u2026             \u2026                                 \n                \u2026             \u2026                                 \n      \u2026         \u2026    \u2026        \u2026                                 \n                \u2026             \u2026                                 \n           +    x             x        =        x        =      \n                \u2026             \u2026                                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  62Wells Fargo & Company                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Executive Compensation                                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Fernando S Rivas                                              \n  As Co-CEO of CIB,                                             \n  Mr. Rivas was                                                 \n  responsible for a                                             \n  comprehensive                                                 \n  suite of capital                                              \n  markets, banking,                                             \n  and financial                                                 \n  products and                                                  \n  services to                                                   \n  corporate,                                                    \n  commercial real                                               \n  estate,                                                       \n  government, and                                               \n  institutional                                                 \n  clients globally.                                             \n  Mr. Rivas became                                              \n  the sole CEO of                                               \n  CIB on January                                                \n  30, 2025.                                                     \n  In determining                                                \n  Mr. Rivas\u2019 2024                                               \n  variable                                                      \n  compensation                                                  \n  award, the HRC                                                \n  focused on the                                                \n  performance          Senior EVP,          2024 Total          \n  below.

The HRC grants PSAs and RSRs to promote long-term\nperformance and risk accountability. These objectives are\nachieved by subjecting long-term equity awards to our Clawback\nPolicies , as applicable. The value ultimately realized from any\nlong-term equity grant is also a function of the number of\nshares that vest and our stock price at the time of vesting and\nsettlement. Finally, PSAs carry additional performance\nrequirements tied to our absolute and relative ROTCE and a TSR\nmodifier based on our performance relative to our Financial\nPerformance Peer Group over a three-year performance period.\n\nConsistent with last year, absolute and relative ROTCE are the\nprimary performance conditions in our PSAs. Effective for PSAs\ngranted in 2025 for 2024 performance, the HRC increased the\nabsolute ROTCE performance required to achieve the target payout\nlevel. Finally, the HRC continued to apply an award payout\nmodifier of +/-20% based on our relative TSR over the three-year\nperformance period. The TSR modifier has been included in PSAs\ngranted since 2022 and supports management accountability for\nour relative stock price performance at the end of the\nperformance period for which an award is earned.\n\n2025 PSA Program\n\nOur PSA program appropriately balances the importance of\nabsolute and relative performance while maintaining rigorous\nperformance targets.\n\nThe 2025 PSA design maintains a consistent program design\nstructurally, with an increase to absolute ROTCE required for\npayout at target, from 2024. As discussed in the Peer Groups\nsection of this proxy statement, the HRC updated the 2025\nFinancial Performance Peer Group for PSA awards granted in 2025\nfor performance year 2024.

Compliance\nwith these stock ownership requirements is calculated annually\nand reported to the HRC.\n\nThe retention requirement applies to each of the NEOs for the\nduration of their time as an executive officer and for one year\nafter retirement. As of December 31, 2024, all NEOs were in\ncompliance with the Stock Ownership Policy.\n\n1. Shares counted toward ownership include shares owned\noutright, as well as shares (and share equivalents) held in the\nCompany 401(k) Plan, Supplemental 401(k) Plan, Deferred\nCompensation Plan, Direct Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment\nPlan, and shares owned by an executive officer\u2019s spouse. In\naddition, 50% of unvested RSRs and target PSAs count toward\nownership.\n\nClawback Policies\n\nThe Company maintains a Mandatory Clawback Policy, as required\nunder Rule 10D-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The\npolicy provides for the recoupment of erroneously awarded excess\nincentive-based compensation in the event of certain accounting\nrestatements and applies to both current and former Section 16\nofficers.\n\nThe Company additionally maintains a discretionary clawback\npolicy, the Clawback and Forfeiture Policy ( Policy ), which is\ndesigned to encourage the creation of long-term, sustainable\nperformance and to discourage our NEOs from taking unnecessary\nor inappropriate risks that would negatively impact our Company\nor harm our customers. This Policy applies to a broader set of\nincentive compensation including all time-based equity awards,\nis triggered by a number of activities including misconduct, and\nenables the HRC and the Board to hold NEOs accountable:\n\n\u2022 During and immediately prior to vesting when risk-based\nperformance and other considerations can reduce or eliminate the\nnumber of shares ultimately earned.\n\n\u2022 Subsequent to vesting when shares earned remain subject to\nclawback.\n\nA summary of the compensation-related actions the Company can\ntake under the Policy, with respect to all currently granted\nforms of incentive compensation, is set forth below:\n                                                                \n  Trigg\u2026               Descri\u2026    Compen\u2026

available to all employees, including health,\ndisability, and other benefits, and our Company 401(k) plan. Our\nCompany matched up to 6% of eligible 401(k) Plan participants\u2019\ncertified compensation (subject to Internal Revenue Service (\nIRS ) limits) during 2024.\n\nNEOs and certain other highly compensated team members are also\neligible to participate in our Deferred Compensation Plan. This\nplan provides for supplemental Company matching contributions\nfor any compensation deferred into the plan in excess of the IRS\nlimits that apply to the 401(k) Plan by participants, that\notherwise would have been eligible for a matching contribution\nunder our Company\u2019s 401(k) Plan.\n\nThe HRC believes these programs are similar to, and competitive\nwith, those offered by our Labor Market Peer Group. We provide\ninformation about the benefits under these plans in the Summary\nCompensation and Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation tables and\nrelated narrative.\n\nPerquisites\n\nThe HRC has intentionally limited perquisites for our NEOs;\nhowever, the HRC has determined that certain physical and\ndigital security measures are necessary to protect and promote\nour NEOs\u2019 personal safety and efficiency. These measures include\nMr. Scharf\u2019s required use of Company aircraft and cars and\ndrivers for certain travel. Mr. Scharf reimburses the Company\nfor the incremental cost in excess of $200,000 for any personal\nuse of the Company aircraft as well as the incremental costs\nassociated with personal, non-commuting use of Company cars and\ndrivers. The Company provides other NEOs with a one-time $50,000\nallowance for residential physical and digital security\nenhancements and $5,000 annually for ongoing physical and\ndigital security maintenance. Although the Company views these\nmeasures as necessary business expenses, in accordance with\nSecurities and Exchange Commission requirements, the aggregate\nincremental cost of personal security benefits are included in\nthe 2024 Summary Compensation Table . For additional information\non such benefits provided in 2024, see footnote 8 to the 2024\nSummary Compensation Table . The Company is considering further\nenhancements to its security program for NEOs for fiscal year\n2025.\n\nOther Compensation\n\nAs part of our efforts to attract and retain top executive\ntalent, we may provide sign-on bonuses and buy-out equity awards\nfor new hires. New hire sign-on bonuses and buy-out equity\nawards are an effective means of making up for compensation\nopportunities executives forfeit when they leave a former\nemployer to join the Company. We typically require executives to\nreturn all or a portion of their sign-on bonus if, within a\ncertain period after joining us, they voluntarily leave the\nCompany or are involuntarily terminated by the Company for\ncause. New hire equity awards are used to incentivize executives\nto join without unnecessarily increasing annual compensation\nlevels. These awards are generally subject to a time-based\nvesting period and such other terms and conditions as the HRC\ndetermines to be appropriate.\n\nIn 2024, we provided one-time signing bonus payments of\n$5,344,120 and a buy-out RSR equity award covering 284,834\nshares to Mr. Rivas to replace compensation forfeited from his\nprior employer. Additionally, in 2024, we provided Ms. Engle two\nbuy-out RSR equity awards covering an aggregate of 296,695\nshares to replace compensation forfeited from her prior\nemployer. For information regarding one-time signing bonus\npayments made during 2024, see the 2024 Summary Compensation\nTable for additional details. For information regarding equity\ngrants made during 2024, see the Grants of Plan-Based Awards\ntable, footnotes, and related narrative.\n                                                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement71                                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Executive Compensation                                        \n                                                                \nCompensation Governance Oversight\n\nThe HRC believes that strong governance and oversight of our\nexecutive compensation program is essential to the Company\u2019s\nlong-term success. To achieve this, the HRC is comprised of\nindependent directors with human capital risk and human capital\nmanagement experience and qualifications. They are informed by\nan independent compensation consultant, to make compensation\ndecisions based on NEO performance and comparison of Labor\nMarket Peer Group executive pay levels and pay practices, based\non discussions throughout the year (in both regularly scheduled\nmeetings and special meetings, as appropriate). Refer to the\nHuman Resources Committee, within Board Committee Members and\nOversight Responsibilities , for a list of key HRC oversight\nresponsibilities and number of meetings each year.\n\nDefining Roles for Effective Oversight of Compensation\n                                                                \n                       Role of the HRC                          \n

  \nIndependent Compensation Consultant\n\nThe HRC is authorized to retain and obtain advice of legal,\naccounting, or other advisors at the Company\u2019s expense without\nprior management or Board approval. For 2024, the HRC retained\nan independent compensation consultant, Meridian, to provide\nindependent advice on executive compensation matters and advise\non the design and disclosure of the compensation elements.\n\nOn an annual basis, the HRC reviews the services performed by,\nand the fees paid to, Meridian. Upon conducting this review, the\nHRC determined that Meridian does no other work for our Company\nor management other than to provide consulting services to the\nGNC, HRC, and Board that are directly related to employee and\nnon-employee director compensation. To help maintain the\nindependence of any consultant retained by the HRC, the HRC is\nrequired under its charter to pre-approve all services performed\nfor our Company by Meridian, other than the services performed\nfor the GNC with respect to non-employee director compensation.\nThe HRC assessed Meridian\u2019s independence considering the NYSE\nlisting standards and SEC rules and concluded that no conflict\nof interest or independence concerns exist.\n\nCompensation Committee Report\n\nIn its capacity as the compensation committee of our Board, the\nHRC has reviewed and discussed with management the CD&A that\nimmediately precedes this report. Based on this review and these\ndiscussions, the HRC has recommended to our Board that the CD&A\nbe included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by\nreference in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024, for filing with the SEC.\n                                                                \n  Members of the Human Resources Committee                      \n                                                                \nRonald L.

For Mr. Rivas, consists of one-time signing bonus payments\npursuant to the terms of his offer letter with the Company, to\nreplace compensation forfeited by Mr. Rivas from his prior\nemployer, which was subject to repayment under certain\ncircumstances if his employment terminated during the first year\nof employment.\n\n2. For Mr. Rivas and Ms. Engle, the stock awards consist of\nRestricted Share Rights (RSRs) granted pursuant to the terms of\ntheir offer letters with the Company to replace compensation\nforfeited by them from their prior employers. For information\nregarding equity grants made during 2024, see the Grants of\nPlan-Based Awards table, footnotes, and related narrative.\n\n3. Under the applicable Financial Accounting Standards Board (\nFASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 718\nrules, the amount included in column (e) above for 2024\nrepresents the fair value of the 2024 PSA or RSR award on its\n\u201cgrant date\u201d (i.e., the date the HRC approved each award), based\n(i) for a PSA upon the then-probable outcome of the ROTCE\nperformance condition (i.e., the target value of the award) and\nusing a Monte Carlo simulation (in light of the relative TSR\ncomponent), and (ii) for an RSR award upon the full number of\nshares subject to the award. See Notes 1 and 12 to our 2024\nfinancial statements included in Exhibit 13 to our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 regarding\nassumptions underlying the valuation of these awards.\n\nAccordingly, the amount shown for 2024 in column (e) for 2024\nPSAs is the fair value of the NEO\u2019s award on the date of grant,\ncalculated by multiplying the target number of shares subject to\nthe award by the Monte Carlo simulated stock price per share\n($51.01) on that date. The amount shown for 2024 in column (e)\nfor RSRs was calculated by multiplying the number of shares\nsubject to the awards by the NYSE closing price per share on the\ndate of grant.\n\n4. The PSAs included in column (e) for 2024 and discussed above\nare (i) subject to adjustment for each NEO upward (to a maximum\nof 150% of the target award) or downward (to zero), depending\nupon the achievement of certain absolute and relative\nperformance conditions based on the average of our ROTCE for the\nthree fiscal years ending on December 31, 2024, 2025, and 2026,\n(ii) modified by +/- 20% if the Company\u2019s relative TSR for the\nperformance period is in the top quartile or bottom quartile,\nrespectively (subject to the maximum of 150%), (iii) subject to\nfurther downward adjustment by 1/3 in the event our Company\nincurs a NOL for any year in the three-year performance period,\nand (iv) subject to forfeiture of the awards.\n\nAssuming (1) that our Company\u2019s performance during the\nmeasurement period for the 2024 PSAs results in the maximum\nnumber of PSAs vesting, and (2) the HRC does not exercise\ndiscretion to cause the forfeiture of the PSAs, the NEOs would\nbe entitled to receive under the PSAs the following value of\nshares determined as of the grant date shown after his name: Mr.\nScharf, $19,378,135; Mr. Santomassimo, $5,827,548; Mr. Weiss,\n$6,849,293.\n\nAdditional information about the PSAs and other awards appears\nin our CD&A and in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table,\nfootnotes, and related narrative.\n\n5. Amounts shown in column (f) for 2024 reflect annual incentive\nnon-equity awards made to each NEO in February 2025 based on\n2024 performance.\n                                                                \n  74Wells Fargo & Company                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Executive Compensation                                        \n                                                                \n6. As of December 31, 2024, Mr. Weiss was the only NEO to\nexperience an increase in the actuarial present value of his\npension benefit under our Cash Balance Plan from December 31,\n2023. The actuarial present value of Mr. Weiss\u2019 pension benefit\nunder our Cash Balance Plan increased by $12,831. All benefits\nunder this plan were frozen in July 2009, and no additional\nretirement benefit has accrued to any named executive since that\ndate. We are required by SEC rules to show the change in the\namount included in column (g) generally using the same actuarial\nmethod and assumptions we use for financial accounting purposes\nto calculate the current value of a future pension benefit\npayout as described in footnote (2) to the 202 4 Pension\nBenefits table below. Information about the actuarial and other\nassumptions used to compute the value of pension benefits for\nour NEOs is discussed in Notes 1 and 22 to our 2024 financial\nstatements included in Exhibit 13 to our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and under 202 4\nPension Benefits below, including in footnotes (2) and (3) to\nthe 202 4 Pension Benefits table.\n\n7. None of the NEOs received any above-market or preferential\nearnings on deferred compensation for the years shown, and\ntherefore no earnings on deferred compensation are included in\ncolumn (g) pursuant to SEC rules.\n\n8. Column (h) for 2024 includes a Company-matching contribution\nof $20,700 under the 401(k) Plan for Mr. Scharf, Mr.\nSantomassimo, and Mr. Weiss, on the same basis as is provided\nfor all eligible participants in the 401(k) Plan. Perquisites\nreceived by Mr. Rivas and Ms. Engle in 2024 did not exceed\n$10,000 in the aggregate and thus are not included in column\n(h), as permitted under SEC rules. For Mr. Scharf, the amount in\ncolumn (h) includes $163,613 for personal use of Company\naircraft, $4,023 for commuting by Company car, $70,448 for\nphysical and digital security , and $164 for a health benefit\nmembership at a health center, a benefit available to all\nemployees at Mr. Scharf\u2019s office location (the \u201cHealth Center\u201d).\nWe determine the incremental cost of personal use of Company\naircraft based on variable operating costs to us, including: (i)\nlanding fees; (ii) crew travel expenses; (iii) catering; and\n(iv) aircraft fuel. Because our aircraft is used primarily for\nbusiness travel, this methodology excludes fixed costs that do\nnot change based on usage, such as the salaries of pilots and\ncrew, purchase or lease costs of aircraft, and costs of\nmaintenance and upkeep. We determine the incremental cost of\nphysical and digital security based on the actual costs incurred\nby the Company. For Mr. Scharf, \u201cAll Other Compensation\u201d also\nincludes the estimated incremental cost of travel by the NEO\u2019s\nspouse when accompanying the NEO. For Mr. Santomassimo, the\namount in column (h) includes $20,733 for physical and digital\nsecurity, and $164 for a health benefit membership at the Health\nCenter.\n\n2024 Grants of Plan-Based Awards 1\n\nThe following table provides additional information about the\nNEOs\u2019 target 2024 annual incentive awards, 2024 PSAs, and 2024\nRSRs.

Under the applicable FASB ASC Topic 718 rules, the total\namount reported in column (h) above represents the fair value of\nthe 2024 PSA or RSR award on its \u201cgrant date\u201d (i.e., the date\nthe HRC approved each award), based (i) for a PSA upon the then-\nprobable outcome of the ROTCE performance condition (i.e., the\ntarget value of the award) and using a Monte Carlo simulation\n(in light of the relative TSR component) resulting in a value of\n$51.01 per share, and (ii) for an RSR award upon the full number\nof shares subject to the award and the NYSE closing price per\nshare on the grant date. See Notes 1 and 12 to our 2024\nfinancial statements included as Exhibit 13 to our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, regarding\nassumptions underlying the valuation of these awards, and\nfootnote (4) to the Summary Compensation Table for additional\ninformation.\n\nAdditional Information About Equity Grants\n\nPSAs\n\nThe HRC granted PSAs to Messrs.

The target and\npotential maximum number of shares that can be earned are shown\nin columns (e) and (f) in the table above. Each PSA represents\nthe right to receive one share of Company common stock upon\nvesting, net of withholding for income taxes, and includes the\nright to receive dividend equivalents in the form of additional\nPSAs. These additional PSAs will be distributed in shares of our\ncommon stock if and when the underlying PSAs vest and are\ndistributed.\n\nThe 2024 PSAs vest after three years in the first quarter of\n2027, with the target number of PSAs for each NEO subject to\nadjustment upward (to a maximum of 150% of the original target\namount granted) or downward (to zero) based on our Company\u2019s\nabsolute and relative ROTCE performance over the three-year\nperiod ending December 31, 2026, and additional NOL, TSR, and\nforfeiture conditions. PSAs are subject to the vesting treatment\ndescribed under Potential Post-Employment Payments and the\nCompany\u2019s Clawback Policies, as applicable.\n\nAdditional information about the terms of these awards appears\nin the CD&A and in footnotes (3) and (4) to the 202 4 Summary\nCompensation Table .\n\nRSRs\n\nThe HRC granted RSRs to Messrs.

The\nDeferred Compensation Plan also provides for supplemental\nCompany-matching contributions related to any compensation\ndeferred by a plan participant, including NEOs, that would have\nbeen eligible (up to certain IRS limits) but for this deferral,\nfor a matching contribution under the 401(k) Plan. As of\nDecember 31, 2024, none of our NEOs were participating in the\nDeferred Compensation Plan.\n\nWachovia Elective Deferral Plan and Wachovia Savings Restoration\nPlan\n\nAs a former Wachovia executive, Mr. Weiss participated in the\nWachovia Elective Deferral Plan and the Wachovia Savings\nRestoration Plan. Participation in these plans was frozen and\ncontributions ceased for the Wachovia Elective Deferral Plan,\neffective December 31, 2008, and for the Wachovia Savings\nRestoration Plan, effective December 31, 2007.\n\nThe Wachovia Elective Deferral Plan is a frozen, unfunded,\nnonqualified deferred compensation plan that allowed certain\nhighly compensated employees to defer base salary and/or\nincentive payments on a pre-tax basis until a future date\n(generally retirement, death, or separation from service). The\nterms of the plan required participants to irrevocably elect the\nform of payment (either in installments or in a lump sum) and\npermitted early withdrawal of account balances in the case of an\nunforeseeable emergency resulting in severe financial hardship.\nIn addition, participant salary deferral amounts were subject to\na Company match in certain circumstances.\n\nThe Wachovia Savings Restoration Plan is a frozen, unfunded,\nnonqualified deferred compensation plan that previously provided\nfor pre-tax deferral contributions to restore Wachovia 401(k)\nPlan contributions beyond the IRS qualified plan contribution\nlimitations. Employees with an annual base salary greater than\nInternal Revenue Code annual covered compensation limits were\neligible to participate and could elect to contribute up to 30%\nof base salary. Wachovia matched participants\u2019 contributions on\na dollar-for-dollar basis up to 6% of base salary. Participants\nelected, at the time they joined the plan, the timing of the\npayment of their account balances (on or after five years of\nparticipation, or upon separation or retirement), as well as the\nform and term of payment of their accounts (lump sum or 10\nannual installments), and may petition for, and receive an early\ndistribution of, their account balances in the event of an\nunforeseeable emergency causing severe financial hardship.\n\nParticipants are entitled to invest all or a portion of their\ndeferral accounts in one or more investment options available\nunder the plans, which generally mirror those offered in the\nWachovia 401(k) Plan, and to receive the earnings on the\ndeferred amounts based on those investment elections upon\ndistribution of the deferral accounts, subject to income tax\nwithholding.\n                                                                \n  80Wells Fargo & Company                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Executive Compensation                                        \n                                                                \nPotential Post-Employment Payments\n\nWe do not have employment or other severance agreements with our\nNEOs. The table below shows estimated post-employment payments\nfor our NEOs, assuming they had terminated employment on\nDecember 31, 2024. To estimate the payment amounts for each NEO,\nwe used the closing price of our common stock on December 31,\n2024 of $70.24.\n\nThe following items are not included in the table or description\nbelow:\n\n\u2022 Retirement benefits under our Cash Balance Plan, which are\ndescribed above under 202 4 Pension Benefits .\n\n\u2022 Distributions of balances under our deferred compensation\nplans, which balances are shown in the 2 02 4 Nonqualified\nDeferred Compensation table above.\n\n\u2022 Payments and benefits provided on a nondiscriminatory basis to\nemployees upon termination of employment. These include accrued\nsalary and accrued but unused paid time off, severance payments\nunder our Severance Plan, distributions of plan balances under\nour 401(k) Plan, and welfare benefits provided to all retirees,\nincluding access to unsubsidized retiree medical insurance. If\neligible under the Severance Plan, employees receive post-\ntermination severance payments based on no more than $350,000\nannual salary for 8 to 52 weeks depending on the number of\ncompleted years of service. If terminated as described below\nunder Estimated Post-Employment Payments and eligible for the\nSeverance Plan, our NEOs would receive the following aggregate\namount under the Severance Plan, as of December 31, 2024: Mr.\nScharf, $67,308; Mr. Santomassimo, $53,846; Mr. Weiss, $255,769;\nMr. Rivas, $53,846; Ms. Engle, $53,846.\n                                                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement81                                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Executive Compensation                                        \n                                                                \nEstimated Post-Employment Payments 1\n                                                                \n                          Type of                               \n                         Termina\u2026                               \n                                                      Disabil\u2026  \n                                                      Involun\u2026  \n                                                      Due to    \n                                                      Displac\u2026  \n                                                      Divesti\u2026  \n             Type of               Death              or        \n  Name       Payment               ($)                Affilia\u2026  \n                                                      Change    \n                                                      in        \n                                                      Control;  \n                                                      or        \n                                                      Retirem\u2026  \n                                                      ($)       \n  Charles                                                       \n  W.

The values shown in the table for the RSRs include the value\nof the 2022 PSAs, for which the performance period was completed\non December 31, 2024. For the 2023 and 2024 PSAs, (i) for death,\nawards are valued at target pursuant to the terms of the\napplicable award agreements; and (ii) for disability, certain\ninvoluntary terminations, or voluntary retirement, awards are\nvalued at the maximum level of performance achievement as of\nDecember 31, 2024. However, because the applicable performance\nperiod for each of these awards has not yet been completed, the\nactual number of 2023 and 2024 PSAs earned will depend on our\nCompany\u2019s level of ROTCE performance and TSR performance over\nthe performance period for each award including reduction for\nNOL, forfeiture provisions, and compliance with covenants.

Under the LTICP, certain involuntary terminations include\nterminations due to displacement and receipt of a lump sum\nseverance benefit, placement on a leave that results in receipt\nof severance benefits, or termination associated with an\naffiliate change in control. Under the LTICP, retirement\ngenerally occurs when an NEO has reached the earliest of (a) age\n55 with 10 completed years of service, (b) 80 points (with one\npoint credited for each completed age year and one point\ncredited for each completed year of service); or (c) age 65. As\nof December 31, 2024, none of our NEOs, other than Mr. Weiss met\nthis definition of retirement. For Mr. Scharf, retirement means\nthe termination of employment (i) after reaching age 55 with\nfive completed years of service or (ii) based on such more\nfavorable treatment as may apply under the practices of the\nCompany in effect from time to time. As of December 31, 2024,\nMr. Scharf met this definition of retirement.\n\n5. Under the LTIP, effective April 2022, certain involuntary\nterminations include terminations due to displacement and\nreceipt of a lump sum severance benefit, placement on a leave\nthat results in receipt of severance benefits, or a termination\nassociated with an affiliate change in control. Under the LTIP,\nretirement generally occurs when an NEO has reached the earliest\nof (a) age 55 with 5 completed years of service or (b) 80 points\n(with one point credited for each completed age year and one\npoint credited for each completed year of service). As of\nDecember 31, 2024, none of our NEOs, other than Mr. Scharf and\nMr. Weiss met this definition of retirement.\n\nUnder our Chair/CEO Post-Retirement Policy, Mr. Scharf is\nentitled to receive, for two years following his retirement,\nsubject to approval of our Board and HRC, office space,\nadministrative assistance, and a part-time driver, provided he\nremains available for management consultation and continues to\nrepresent us with our customers, community, and employees during\nthis period. The value of benefits provided under this policy\nwould depend on Mr. Scharf\u2019s use of the same.\n                                                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement83                                        \n                                                                \nTable of Contents\n\nCEO Pay Ratio and Median Employee Annual Total Compensation\n\nCEO Pay Ratio\n\nFor 2024, the annual total compensation of Mr. Scharf, our CEO,\nwas $30,313,559, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table.\nThe estimated annual total compensation of the median Wells\nFargo employee (other than our CEO) was $80,296. As such, our\nCEO\u2019s total annual compensation was approximately 378 times that\nof the estimated annual total compensation of the median Wells\nFargo employee in 2024.\n                                                                \n  CEO annual total compensation                    $30,313,559  \n  Median Employee estimated annual total               $80,296  \n  compensation                                                  \n  Ratio of CEO annual total compensation to                     \n  Median                                                 378:1  \n  Employee estimated annual total compensation                  \n                                                                \nMedian Employee Total Annual Compensation Methodology\n\nTo identify the estimated total annual compensation of the\nmedian Wells Fargo employee other than our CEO:\n\n\u2022 We prepared a database including the total gross amount of\nsalary, wages, and other non-equity compensation (which\ndepending on the individual could include items such as holiday\nand other paid time off, overtime pay, shift differentials), as\nreflected in our payroll records for 2024, for our global\nworkforce (other than our CEO) as of December 31, 2024. As\nneeded, amounts were converted from local currency to U.S.\ndollars.\n\n\u2022 We annualized the compensation of all permanent employees who\nwere newly hired during 2024.\n\n\u2022 We calculated the median gross pay (as described in the first\nbullet above) and selected the employee that made up the median.\nIn addition to the employee that made up the median, we selected\nfour employees immediately above and four employees immediately\nbelow to further analyze.\n\n\u2022 For the nine employees, we combined all of the elements of\neach employee\u2019s compensation for 2024 to calculate total\ncompensation with the same methodology used to calculate the\n\u201cTotal\u201d column of the 202 4 Summary Compensation Table in\naccordance with SEC rules and regulations.\n\nThe pay ratio reported above is a reasonable estimate calculated\nin a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our internal\nrecords and the methodology described above. The SEC rules for\nidentifying the median compensated employee and calculating the\npay ratio based on that employee\u2019s total annual compensation\nallow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply\ncertain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and\nassumptions that reflect their employee populations and\ncompensation practices. Therefore, the pay ratio reported by\nother companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported\nabove, as other companies have different employee populations\nand compensation practices and may utilize different\nmethodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in\ncalculating their own pay ratios.\n                                                                \n  84Wells Fargo & Company                                       \n                                                                \nTable of Contents Pay Versus Performance As required by Section\n953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act, and Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, we are\nproviding the following information about the relationship\nbetween executive \u201ccompensation actually paid\u201d and certain\nfinancial performance of the Company.

While the Company utilizes several\nperformance measures to align executive compensation with\nCompany performance, all of those Company measures are not\npresented in the Pay Versus Performance table. Moreover, the\nCompany generally seeks to incentivize long-term performance,\nand therefore does not specifically align the Company\u2019s\nperformance measures with \u201ccompensation actually paid.\u201d The most\nimportant financial performance measures used by the Company to\nlink executive compensation actually paid to the Company\u2019s NEOs,\nfor the most recently completed fiscal year, to the Company\u2019s\nperformance are: (1) ROTCE; (2) Total Revenue; and (3)\nEfficiency Ratio. Each of these performance measures is included\nin the evaluation of Company performance as part of the variable\ncompensation program, and PSAs carry performance requirements\ntied to relative and/or absolute ROTCE.

Includes standing committee/subcommittee meetings, as well as\nspecial purpose committee meetings not held concurrently with or\nimmediately prior to or following a Company Board or\ncommittee/subcommittee meeting.\n\nDirectors of the Bank Board received an additional $10,000\nannual cash retainer, and the chair of the Bank Board received\nan annual fee of $25,000, each payable quarterly in arrears. The\nRCOC chair also received a total chair fee of $10,000.\n\n2024 Equity Compensation\n\nFor 2024, each non-employee director elected to our Board at our\nCompany\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders received on that date\nan equity award having a value of $240,000. The dollar value of\neach equity award was converted to a number of RSRs using the\nclosing price on the grant date, rounded up to the nearest whole\nshare unit. We require deferral of these RSRs until a director\nleaves the Board or later, if elected by the director. Upon\ninitial election to the Board, Mr. Garcia, as a newly elected\nnon-employee director, received 100 shares of our common stock.\n\nThe Board Chair also received a $250,000 annual retainer in lieu\nof any committee chair fee the independent Chair might otherwise\nreceive. This annual retainer is paid in the form of quarterly\nequity awards and must be deferred until the Chair leaves the\nBoard or later, if elected by the Chair.\n\nDeferral Program\n\nFor 2024, non-employee directors were able to defer all or part\nof their cash compensation and equity awards. Cash compensation\ncould be deferred into either an interest-bearing account or\ncommon stock units with dividends reinvested. The interest rate\npaid in 2024 on interest-bearing accounts was 3.96%. Equity\nawards are mandatorily deferred RSRs with dividends reinvested.\nDeferred amounts are paid either in a lump sum or installments,\nas elected by the director.\n\nDirector Compensation Limit\n\nOur equity incentive plan contains an upper limit of the total\ncompensation that a non-employee director may receive annually.\nSpecifically, the total annual compensation paid to any non-\nemployee director, inclusive of cash compensation and amounts\nawarded under the 2022 LTIP, shall not exceed $750,000, except\nthat in the case of the Board Chair or any independent lead\ndirector, such limit is instead $1,500,000.\n                                                                \n  88Wells Fargo & Company                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Director Compensation                                         \n                                                                \nDirector Stock Ownership Policy\n\nAfter five years on the Board, each non-management director must\nown Wells Fargo common stock having a value equal to five times\nthe annual cash retainer, and must maintain at least that\nownership level while a member of our Board and for one year\nafter service as a director ends. Holding deferred shares counts\ntoward a non-employee director\u2019s ownership level, regardless of\nwhether the award(s) underlying the deferred shares have vested.\nCompliance with these stock ownership requirements is calculated\nannually and reported to the GNC. Each director who has been on\nour Board for five years or more exceeded this ownership level\nas of December 31, 2024, and each director who has served less\nthan five years is on track to meet this ownership level within\nfive years of becoming a director.\n\nGNC Use of Compensation Consultant\n\nThe GNC annually reviews our director compensation program and\nperiodically recommends changes to the program for our Board to\napprove. The GNC\u2019s review and recommendation, if any, considers\nour director pay philosophy, relevant market practices, and\nconsultation with Meridian, the GNC\u2019s independent compensation\nconsultant.\n\nCompensation Changes for 2025\n\nFollowing Meridian\u2019s analysis of our non-employee director\ncompensation program, including in comparison to the Labor\nMarket Peer Group, and upon the recommendation of the GNC, our\nBoard has approved changes to the program, effective April 1,\n2025. The changes include discontinuing Board, committee, and\nsubcommittee meeting fees; increasing the value of the annual\nstock award to $265,000; increasing the annual board member cash\nretainer to $110,000; and increasing the GNC Chair retainer to\n$35,000 in connection with the GNC\u2019s expanded responsibilities\nfollowing the integration of the CRC.\n\nDirector Compensation\n\nThe table below provides information on 2024 compensation for\nour non-employee directors.

Preliminary fee levels    \n       will not exceed amounts pre-approved for these services  \n       in the preceding calendar year, and a subsequent         \n       re\ufb01nement of the actual fees incurred as a result of     \n       changes in the scope of services will be submitted to    \n  1    the Audit Committee for pre-approval. The Audit          \n       Committee or a designee must pre-approve changes in the  \n       scope of recurring services if they will result in fee   \n       increases in excess of a relatively small amount         \n       established by the Audit Committee prior to such         \n       additional services being provided by KPMG. Changes in   \n       the scope of pre-approved services with estimated costs  \n       less than that amount may be approved by the Chief       \n       Accounting O\ufb03cer and Controller.                         \n       For a particular calendar year, speci\ufb01c types of audit,  \n       audit-related, advisory, consulting, or tax services     \n       that could arise with respect to that calendar year      \n       that were not already pre-approved as recurring          \n  2    services, subject to a fee cap for each category for     \n       that year. The Audit Committee also provided the Chief   \n       Accounting O\ufb03cer with 2025 pre-approval authority for    \n       audit, audit-related, tax, and other services subject    \n       to annual fee caps for each category.                    \n       From time to time during the year, services that have    \n  3    neither been pre-approved as recurring services nor      \n       pre-approved pursuant to the categorical pre-approval    \n       described above.                                         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  94Wells Fargo & Company                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Audit Matters                                                 \n                                                                \nIn determining whether to pre-approve the provision by KPMG of a\npermissible non-audit service, the Audit Committee considers the\nfacts and circumstances of the engagement, including other non-\naudit services provided by KPMG and the fees for those services,\nand whether the provision of the non-audit service by KPMG could\nimpair the independence of KPMG with respect to Wells Fargo. The\nAudit Committee also considers whether KPMG is best positioned\nto provide the service because of its familiarity with our\nbusiness, culture, accounting systems, risk pro\ufb01le, and other\nfactors, and whether there are alternatives reasonably available\nto us and the cost of those alternatives. The Audit Committee\nrequires competitive bidding for services that are eligible for\ncategorical pre-approval and services subject to individual pre-\napproval unless it is not warranted because of the facts and\ncircumstances of the proposed engagement.\n\nDelegation of Pre-Approval Authority\n\nThe Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority to\ndesignated Audit Committee members. Pre-approval by a designated\nAudit Committee member is used for time sensitive engagements.\nPre-approval decisions by a designated Audit Committee member\nare reported to the full Audit Committee at a future meeting.\n                                                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement95                                        \n                                                                \nTable of Contents\n\nShareholder Proposals\n                                                  \n  Items 4 through 7                               \n  Shareholder Proposals                           \n  Our Board recommends that you voteAGAINSTeach   \n  shareholder proposal for the reasons set forth  \n  below each proposal.                            \n                                                  \nShareholders will vote on the following shareholder proposals\n(Items 4 through 7), if they are properly presented at our\nAnnual Meeting and not previously withdrawn or otherwise\nexcluded. The text of these proposals and supporting statements\nappear in the form in which we received them. The proposals may\ncontain assertions about our Company that we believe are\nincorrect. We have not attempted to refute all inaccuracies.\n\nWe provide the name and address of the lead proponent for each\nshareholder proposal, as well as the number or market value of\nshares held (if available). We will supply the name and address\nof, and number of shares held (if available) by any co-filer,\nupon oral or written request to our Corporate Secretary.\n\nOur Board is involved in the review and response to shareholder\nproposals, with Board committees reviewing shareholder proposals\nrelated to the matters they oversee. More detail about our\nBoard\u2019s oversight responsibilities is available in the section\nof this Proxy Statement called Board Structure and Operations ,\nwhich notes that in January 2025, our Board approved the\nintegration of the responsibilities of the CRC into our GNC\u2019s\nresponsibilities and the related dissolution of the CRC. As a\nresult, the GNC is now responsible for overseeing the topics\npreviously overseen by the CRC, including the relevant CRC\noversight responsibilities described in our responses to the\nshareholder proposals that follow.\n\nIn response to a 2023 majority-supported shareholder proposal,\nin 2024 we proposed amendments to remove our two remaining\nsupermajority voting standards. The proposed first amendment\nopting out of Delaware General Corporation Law Section 203\npassed and has since been implemented. The second proposal to\namend the \u201clocal directors\u201d provision of our By-Laws did not\nreceive the requisite level of approval, despite our enhanced\noutreach efforts. We shared these results with the 2023\nproponent. We have determined that it is not in the best\ninterests of shareholders to re-propose the By-Law amendment at\nthis time, based on the provision\u2019s limited applicability, the\nBoard\u2019s demonstrated commitment to taking steps necessary to\nremove the remaining supermajority voting standards, shareholder\nfeedback, and the significant resources required to present the\nproposal, despite the low likelihood of success due to the high\napproval threshold.\n                                                                \n  96Wells Fargo & Company                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Shareholder Proposals                                         \n                                                                \n                                                      \n  Item 4                                              \n  Shareholder Proposal \u2013 Annual Report on Prevention  \n  of Workplace Harassment and Discrimination          \n  Our Board recommends that you voteAGAINSTthis       \n  proposal.                                           \n                                                      \nThe Comptroller of the State of New York, Thomas P. DiNapoli,\nTrustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, 110 State\nStreet, 14th Floor, Albany, NY 12236, the holder of 5,045,609\nshares of our common stock, has advised us that he intends to\nintroduce the following resolution at the 2025 Annual Meeting:\n\nResolution and Supporting Statement\n\nResolved:\n\nShareholders request the Board of Directors oversee the\npreparation of an annual public report describing and\nquantifying the effectiveness and outcomes of Wells Fargo\u2019s\nefforts to prevent harassment and discrimination against its\nprotected classes of employees. In its discretion, the Board may\nwish to consider including disclosures such as the:\n\n\u2022 total number and aggregate dollar amount of disputes settled\nby the company related to abuse, harassment or discrimination in\nthe previous three years;\n\n\u2022 total number of pending harassment or discrimination\ncomplaints the company is seeking to resolve through internal\nprocesses, arbitration or litigation;\n\n\u2022 aggregate dollar amount associated with the enforcement of\narbitration clauses;\n\n\u2022 number of enforceable contracts which include concealment\nclauses that restrict discussions of harassment or\ndiscrimination, and\n\n\u2022 aggregate dollar amount associated with agreements which\ncontain concealment clauses.\n\nConcealment clauses are defined as any employment or\npostemployment agreement, such as arbitration, nondisclosure or\nnondisparagement agreements, that the Company asks employees to\nsign which would limit their ability to discuss unlawful acts in\nthe workplace, including harassment and discrimination.\n\nThis report should not include the names of accusers or\nidentifying details of their settlements without their consent\nand should be prepared at a reasonable cost and omit any\ninformation that is proprietary, privileged, or violative of\ncontractual obligations\n                                                                \n  Supporting Statement                                          \n                                                                \nPersistent controversies have surrounded Wells Fargo\u2019s workforce\nmanagement, so it is no surprise that at last year\u2019s shareholder\nmeeting a proposal with the same resolved clause received\nsubstantial support. Wells Fargo\u2019s hiring practices came under\nscrutiny when it was reported that the Company conducted\ninterviews of diverse candidates for positions that had already\nbeen filled, and subsequently retaliated against employees that\ncomplained about the sham interviews.\n\nThe Company faces a putative securities class action alleging\ninvestors were misled over its efforts to implement its \u201cDiverse\nSearch Requirement\u201d. The suit claims, that while promoting its\ndiverse hiring practices to its investors, the Company was\nactually conducting sham interviews of individuals it had no\nintention of hiring. There has also been a steady stream of\ndiscrimination and retaliation suits filed by employees.\n\nThe Company in its 2024 Proxy Statement, opposed this proposal\narguing that its racial equity assessment is responsive to the\nproposal falls flat. The assessment does not address broad\nissues of discrimination or the effectiveness of its programs,\nlet alone disclose this information to shareholders.\n\nThis public report would assist shareholders in assessing\nwhether the Company is improving its workforce management. Civil\nrights violations within the workplace can result in substantial\ncosts to companies, including legal costs, fines and penalties,\ncosts related to absenteeism, and reduced productivity. A\ncompany\u2019s failure to properly manage its workforce can have\nsignificant ramifications, making it more difficult to retain\nand recruit employees, and jeopardize relationships with\ncustomers and other partners.\n                                                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement97                                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Shareholder Proposals                                         \n                                                                \nOur Statement in Opposition\n\nAnnual Report on Prevention of Workplace Harassment and\nDiscrimination\n\nOur Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal, identified as\nItem 4 on the proxy card.\n\n\u2022 Our Board has already taken action to address shareholders\u2019\nfeedback on this topic. At the 2024 annual shareholder meeting,\nsubstantially the same shareholder proposal did not receive\nmajority support, with a significant decline in support of more\nthan 24 percentage points year-over-year from 2023, when the\nproposal received majority support. After the 2023 annual\nshareholder meeting, we responded to shareholder feedback by\nproviding additional disclosure about Board oversight and our\nframework to prevent and address harassment and discrimination.\nWe view the subsequent 2024 voting outcome, where the proposal\ndid not pass and support declined from 52.3% in 2023 to 28.2% in\n2024, as a reflection of our efforts to address this topic\nappropriately and in a manner consistent with shareholder\nfeedback. We have continued to engage with shareholders\nfollowing the 2024 annual shareholder meeting, with our HRC\nChair participating in certain engagements, including a meeting\nwith the proponent. Shareholders broadly appreciated our\nresponsiveness to the prior proposals and our ongoing efforts in\n2024 related to human capital matters.\n\n\u2022 Our Board, directly and through its committees, is responsible\nfor holding senior management accountable for defining and\nmaintaining a culture of effective risk management. Our Board\nand the HRC provide oversight of, and are engaged in, matters\nrelated to human capital risk and human capital management, in\naddition to culture and ethics. Following the 2024 annual\nshareholder meeting, the HRC has continued to engage regularly\nwith management regarding our culture, conduct management, and\nhuman capital risk. The Board and the HRC review metrics related\nto these topics as part of their oversight of this area. We\ncontinue to believe that disclosure of these types of metrics\nwould be inappropriate, and that disclosure of the particular\nmetrics requested by the proposal, without external, relative\nbenchmarks or broadly-defined reporting standards, would not\nyield useful information to our shareholders. Instead, such\ndisclosure could increase risks for Wells Fargo without\nproviding value to the Company or our shareholders.\n\n\u2022 As further described below, we have a well-developed framework\ndesigned to prevent and address harassment and discrimination,\nincluding a coordinated process for managing employee conduct\nallegations. In addition, our various policies and reporting\nchannels, which include an option for anonymous reporting, are\ndesigned to allow employees to raise concerns without fear of\nretaliation or reprisal and commit us to managing allegations in\nan objective, thorough, and timely manner. We believe our\npolicies and procedures reflect our efforts to prevent and\naddress harassment and discrimination.\n\nShareholder Engagement and Responsiveness\n\nAt our 2024 and 2023 annual shareholder meetings, shareholders\nvoted on substantially the same shareholder proposal (the 2024\nProposal and the 2023 Proposal , respectively), both of which\nwere submitted by the proponent. After the 2023 Proposal\nreceived majority support, we conducted multiple rounds of\nengagement with the proponent and our top shareholders, with\nselect participation from our Board Chair and HRC Chair. Based\non the feedback we heard during those engagements, we responded\nto the 2023 Proposal by providing additional disclosure about\nBoard oversight of human capital risk and human capital\nmanagement and the Company\u2019s modified framework to prevent and\naddress harassment and discrimination. Our relevant policies and\nprocedures apply to all employees, and are designed to prevent\nand address harassment and discrimination against all\ncharacteristics protected by applicable law.\n\nThe following year, the 2024 Proposal did not receive majority\nsupport, with support declining by more than 24 percentage\npoints, from 52.3% support in 2023 to 28.2% in 2024. We believe\nthe voting outcome at the 2024 annual shareholder meeting is a\nreflection of the actions we have taken to respond to\nshareholder feedback in a manner that is appropriately aligned\nwith our strategic and risk priorities.\n\nAs described in the Shareholder Engagement section of this Proxy\nStatement, we have continued to engage with investors on this\ntopic following the 2024 annual shareholder meeting, with our\nHRC Chair directly participating in certain engagements,\nincluding a meeting with the proponent. Through these\nengagements, our top shareholders largely expressed broad\nsupport for our ongoing work related to workplace culture and\nefforts to prevent and address harassment and discrimination,\nand our responsiveness to the prior shareholder proposals.\nShareholders expressed interest in human capital-related\nmatters, including the Board\u2019s oversight of human capital risk\nand human capital management, and generally did not focus on\ndisclosure of specific metrics, including those metrics\nrequested by the proposal.\n                                                                \n  98Wells Fargo & Company                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Shareholder Proposals                                         \n                                                                \nDuring our conversations with investors, we continued to\ndescribe our management policies and practices and Board\noversight of this topic, and to discuss our concerns that\ndisclosure of related metrics could subject us to increased risk\nwithout providing value to Wells Fargo or our shareholders. Both\nthe GNC and HRC reviewed and discussed the 2024 Proposal, the\nvote results, shareholder feedback, and the current proposal.\nAll of this information has informed the Board\u2019s recommendation\nagainst this proposal.\n\nBoard and Committee Oversight\n\nOur top priority remains the foundational and ongoing work of\nbuilding out a risk and control infrastructure and culture\nappropriate for our Company. As part of its oversight of this\nwork, the Board, directly and through its committees, is\nresponsible for holding senior management accountable for\ndefining and maintaining a culture of effective risk management.\nThe Board, directly and through the HRC, oversees human capital\nrisk and human capital management, in addition to our culture\nand ethics. For certain matters, our Board provides oversight\ndirectly, rather than through its committees. For example, the\nBoard uses a variety of tools to oversee and assess culture and\nrelated metrics:\n\n\u2022 Our Board reviews the results of our annual Global Employee\nSurvey with management and has reviewed management reports on\nWells Fargo\u2019s culture.\n\n\u2022 Our Board periodically reviews with management special topics\nand trends relating to human capital matters, such as labor\nrelations.\n\n\u2022 As part of its review and approval of our overall strategic\nplan, our Board annually engages with our Head of Human\nResources regarding the strategy for the Human Resources\ndepartment and reviews our Independent Risk Management team\u2019s\nassessment of that strategy.\n\nWe believe our Board is well equipped to oversee workforce\nmatters, with a substantial majority of our directors having\nhuman capital management experience gained through senior\nmanagement roles in the financial services, insurance, and\nretail sectors, among others.\n\nFor certain other human capital matters, our Board delegates\nauthority to the HRC, which is comprised entirely of members\nwith human capital management skills and expertise. The HRC:\n\n\u2022 oversees performance management, talent management,\ncompensation, and related topics;\n\n\u2022 periodically reviews the Code of Conduct and management\u2019s\nefforts to foster responsible conduct and ethical behavior and\ndecision\u2011making throughout Wells Fargo; and\n\n\u2022 regularly engages with and reviews reports from our Head of\nHuman Resources and our senior executive who oversees conduct\nmanagement, including:\n\n\u2013 culture reports and metrics, including the results of our\nannual Global Employee Survey;\n\n\u2013 conduct management reports, metrics, and trends relating to\nthe general employee population, including harassment and\ndiscrimination metrics and other information regarding\nmisconduct allegations;\n\n\u2013 human capital risk reports and related metrics, and monitoring\nof human capital risks such as staffing and attrition; related\nrisk appetite measures and key risk indicators; and the control\nenvironment and results of internal audit reviews of Human\nResources;\n\n\u2013 reports related to emerging trends such as labor relations;\nand\n\n\u2013 regulatory matters relating to the Human Resources function.\n\nWhile the Board reviews a variety of metrics as part of its\noversight of human capital risk, we believe that disclosure of\nthese types of metrics would be inappropriate, and that\ndisclosure of the particular metrics requested by the proposal,\nwithout external, relative benchmarks or broadly-defined\nreporting standards, would not yield useful information to our\nshareholders. Instead, such disclosure could increase risks for\nWells Fargo without providing value to the Company or our\nshareholders.\n\nOur Harassment and Discrimination Framework and Disclosures\n\nThe Human Capital Management section of this Proxy Statement\nincludes information on, among other things, our policies and\npractices to prevent and address harassment and discrimination.\nWhile our goal is prevention, when an allegation of\ndiscrimination or harassment is made, our policies require us to\nthoroughly and objectively investigate and take appropriate\naction, up to and including termination of any employee found to\nhave engaged in inappropriate conduct.\n                                                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement99                                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Shareholder Proposals                                         \n                                                                \nOur commitments in this area are communicated and reinforced\nthrough employee training programs. U.S. employees are required\nto complete anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training\nannually. This training covers expectations for workplace\nconduct, helps employees recognize situations that may involve\nharassment or discrimination, and describes the ways in which\nemployees can report harassment and discrimination matters,\nincluding options to report anonymously, without fear of\nretaliation.\n\nWe continue to assess employee awareness of, and comfort with,\nour anti-harassment and discrimination policies and reporting\nchannels through assessments that follow mandatory training. We\nrecently supplemented that assessment through a quarterly survey\nthat we send to randomized samples of employees in addition to\nour annual Global Employee Survey. In response to a 2024\nquarterly survey, 99% of respondents indicated that they are\naware of our anti-harassment and discrimination policy, and\naware of their obligation to report any harassment or\ndiscrimination at Wells Fargo.\n\nThe Human Capital Management section of this Proxy Statement\ndescribes a number of forums we provide for employees to share\ntheir voices and insights in a public or private manner.\n\nThe proponent claims that arbitration, non-disclosure, non-\ndisparagement or similar clauses could limit employees\u2019 ability\nto discuss unlawful acts in the workplace. In 2020, we\neliminated mandatory arbitration for employees in connection\nwith sexual harassment claims before the law required it.\nFurthermore, in 2023, we eliminated confidentiality and non-\ndisparagement provisions from severance agreements for non-\nsupervisory employees. For employees hired on or after December\n11, 2015, our policies provide that unresolved employment\ndisputes will be addressed through arbitration, but we do not\nimpose a non-disclosure or confidentiality requirement on\nemployees who participate in arbitration, nor does arbitration\nrestrict an employee from filing a claim with the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission or appropriate state agency.\nIn the limited circumstances when we may use confidentiality\nclauses, such as when resolving claims through a settlement\nagreement, the clauses do not prevent an employee from reporting\nconcerns about allegedly inappropriate workplace conduct to\nappropriate law enforcement bodies or regulators.\n                                                                \n  Our Allegation Management Program                             \n  We run a coordinated process for managing employee conduct    \n  allegations designed to allow employees to raise concerns     \n  without fear of retaliation or reprisal, and support the      \n  management of allegations and post-allegation reviews and     \n  actions.                                                      \n  Allegations Lifecycle                                         \n  We provide multiple avenues for employees to raise concerns   \n  (including on an anonymous basis). For example, employees     \n  can report directly to their managers or any manager with     \n  whom they feel comfortable. Employees can also access our     \n  confidential EthicsLine (which is managed for us by a third   \n  party) by phone or online any time to report complaints,      \n  violations, and other concerns. Our policies prohibit         \n  retaliation of any kind against anyone for providing          \n  information in good faith or otherwise in accordance with     \n  applicable country\u2011specific laws.                             \n  When an allegation is made, our policies require us to        \n  thoroughly and objectively investigate it and take            \n  appropriate action, up to and including termination of any    \n  employee found to have engaged in inappropriate conduct.      \n  We track allegations throughout their lifecycle, including    \n  the resulting outcomes, as part of our process for reviewing  \n  allegations in a timely manner. This process manages the      \n  investigation from intake of the allegation through closure.  \n  Post-Allegation Reviews and Actions                           \n  To solicit feedback on the investigations process, the        \n  Employee Investigations team will from time to time survey    \n  parties involved in an investigation.                         \n  We also complete post-allegation reviews and other actions.   \n  Where appropriate, this includes conducting root cause        \n  analyses to consider trends or themes, and from time to       \n  time, we may also conduct ad hoc deep dive analyses to        \n  assess trends.                                                \n  Board Reporting                                               \n  Our Board, directly and through its committees, receives      \n  regular reports from management on the following topics in    \n  connection with our allegation management program:            \n  \u2022Audit Committee: complaints regarding accounting, internal   \n  accounting control, or auditing matters                       \n  \u2022HRC: conduct management reports, metrics, and trends,        \n  including harassment and discrimination metrics               \n  \u2022Risk Committee: conduct risk, including conduct management   \n  activities and Independent Risk Management\u2019s conduct risk     \n  oversight                                                     \n  \u2022Board: significant events or concerns, and Board Committee   \n  reports, as appropriate                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  100Wells Fargo & Company                                      \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Shareholder Proposals                                         \n                                                                \nWe believe the report requested by the proposal is unnecessary\nbecause our actions, disclosures in this Proxy Statement about\nour Board\u2019s ongoing oversight of human capital risk and human\ncapital management, and our current framework of comprehensive\npolicies, procedures and programs related to preventing and\naddressing harassment and discrimination and employee conduct\nallegations are responsive to the requests of the proposal, and\nalready address the priorities of our shareholders.

Congressman Casten\nand Senator Schatz wrote our Chief Executive Officer, requesting\nconfirmation of Company plans to withdraw sponsorship of SFOF,\nemphasizing SFOF\u2019s approach misrepresents valid steps banks and\nasset managers are taking to minimize climate risk exposure. 5\n\nWhile Wells Fargo claimed to combat inequalities, it continued\nto profit from abusive practices, paying over 175 million\ndollars in a discriminatory lending practices settlement.\n\nWells Fargo Political Action Committee (PAC) \u201cTransparency\nReport\u201d leaked, detailing contribution criteria, noting the PAC\naims to support candidates who \u201care willing to work in a\nbipartisan manner\u2026 and support diversity, equity, and\ninclusion.\u201d 6 Yet, some of the PAC\u2019s political contributions\ncontradict this goal.\n\nFor example, the PAC donated to members of Congress that voted\nagainst certifying the Electoral College, including Kevin\nMcCarthy, Blaine Luetkemeyer, and David Kustoff. 7 Texas\nGovernor Abbott received 20,000 dollars, despite launching child\nabuse investigations into parents of trans youth. 8\n\n1. https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/corporate-\nresponsibility/environmental-social-governance-report.pdf\n\n2. https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/corporate-\nresponsibility/environmental-social-governance-report.pdf\n\n3. https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/corporate-\nresponsibility/environment/.\n\n4. https://casten.house.gov/sites/evo-\nsubsites/casten.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/10-20-22-wf-\nsfof-sponsorship-follow-up_1.pdf\n\n5. https://casten.house.gov/sites/evo-\nsubsites/casten.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/10-20-22-wf-\nsfof-sponsorship-follow-up_1.pdf\n\n6. https://popular.info/p/behind-the-curtain-of-wells-fargos\n\n7. https://popular.info/p/behind-the-curtain-of-wells-fargos\n\n8. https://popular.info/p/behind-the-curtain-of-wells-fargos\n                                                                \n  102Wells Fargo & Company                                      \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Shareholder Proposals                                         \n                                                                \nResolved : Shareholders request that Wells Fargo report to\nshareholders annually, at reasonable expense and excluding\nconfidential information, a congruency analysis between\ncorporate values as defined by Wells Fargo\u2019s stated policies and\nCompany contributions on electioneering and to any organizations\ndedicated to affecting public policy. The report should include\na list of any such contributions occurring during the prior year\nmisaligned with stated corporate values, stating the\njustification for such exceptions.\n\nSupporting Statement: Proponents recommend, at Board and\nmanagement discretion, the report also include management\u2019s\nanalysis of risks to the Company brand, reputation, or\nshareholder value associated with incongruent expenditures.\n\u201cElectioneering expenditures\u201d means spending, from corporate\ntreasury and from the PAC, directly or through a third party, at\nany time during the year, on printed, internet, or broadcast\ncommunications, which are reasonably susceptible to\ninterpretation as being in support of or opposition to a\nspecific candidate.\n\nOur Statement in Opposition\n\nAnnual Report on Congruency of Political Spending and Corporate\nValues\n\nOur Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal, identified as\nItem 5 on the proxy card.\n\n\u2022 Following the submission of substantially the same proposal at\nthe 2024 annual shareholder meeting, which did not receive\nmajority support, we engaged with many of our shareholders to\nunderstand their views and share our perspective on this topic.\nThese engagements helped inform our response to the current\nproposal. During our conversations, shareholders generally did\nnot convey expectations for the report requested by the\nproposal, and some were appreciative of our recent disclosure\nenhancements made in response to feedback from prior years.\n\n\u2022 Our Board and its committees oversee government relations\nstrategies, policies, and programs, including political\ntransparency matters. In 2024, the CRC received an update from\nthe Head of Government Relations and Public Policy (GRPP) on our\npolitical activities and contributions, significant lobbying\npriorities, principal trade association memberships and our\npublic policy priorities.\n\n\u2022 We already disclose detailed information regarding our\nfederal, state, and local lobbying activities, our memberships\nin principal trade associations, contributions to organizations\norganized under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code (527\nOrganizations), and contributions made by Wells Fargo\u2019s\nemployee-funded political action committees (PACs). We review\nthese disclosures annually, and enhance them when appropriate.\nFor example, by the end of 2025, we will enhance the disclosures\non our GRPP website related to, among other things, our public\npolicy priorities and federal lobbying reports, and will also\nclarify our disclosures relating to our practices for\ncontributing to organizations organized under section 501(c)(4)\nof the Internal Revenue Code (501(c)(4) Organizations) and 527\nOrganizations. In addition, next year we plan to disclose on our\nGRPP website the annual amount spent on federal lobbying\nactivities.\n\n\u2022 We believe that participating in the public policy process\nhelps protect our customers, employees, businesses, and\ncommunities, and is an important part of responsible corporate\ncitizenship. Engagement through trade organizations comes with\nthe understanding that we may not always agree with every\nposition taken.\n\nShareholder Engagement\n\nAt our 2024 and 2023 annual shareholder meetings, shareholders\nvoted on substantially the same shareholder proposal (the 2024\nProposal and the 2023 Proposal , respectively), both of which\nwere also submitted by the proponent. The 2024 and 2023\nProposals did not receive majority support, with a decline in\nsupport year-over-year. Based on our engagement with\nshareholders to discuss the prior proposals, we believe the\nstrength of our existing and enhanced approach and disclosures,\nand the actions we have taken, are responsive to shareholder\nfeedback in a manner that is appropriately aligned with our\nstrategic and risk priorities. As described in the Shareholder\nEngagement section of this Proxy Statement, we have continued to\nengage with our shareholders on this topic. During these\nconversations, shareholders generally did not convey\nexpectations for the report requested by the proposal. We also\nengaged again with the proponent. The GNC and the CRC reviewed\nand discussed the 2024 and 2023 Proposals, the vote results,\nshareholder feedback and the current proposal. All of this\ninformation has informed the Board\u2019s recommendation against this\nproposal.\n                                                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement103                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Shareholder Proposals                                         \n                                                                \nBoard and Committee Oversight\n\nWe believe we have appropriate oversight of our political and\nlobbying activities. The applicable Board committee assists our\nBoard in overseeing social and public responsibility matters. To\nthat end, the Board\u2019s committees oversee our significant\nstrategies, policies, and programs on government relations. The\nBoard\u2019s committees also monitor and receive updates on\nsignificant public policy developments, and in 2024, the CRC\nreceived an update from the Head of GRPP on the following\nmatters:\n\n\u2022 our political activities and contributions, significant\nlobbying priorities, principal trade association memberships,\nand public policy priorities;\n                                                                \n  \u2022                                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  our significant public policy priorities; and                 \n                                                                \n\u2022 our PACs, for which we have established and published criteria\nguiding our decision-making for supporting candidates.\n\nAt the management level, our GRPP team is responsible for\nmanaging the development and execution of strategies that\nadvance our public policy priorities. The Head of GRPP reports\nto the Head of Public Affairs, who is a direct report to our\nCEO.\n\nEnhanced Disclosures\n\nOur GRPP website already includes significant disclosures\nrelated to political and public policy contributions, including:\n\n\u2022 a link to the government website that houses our quarterly\nfederal lobbying filings, which publicly disclose to Congress\nthe amount of our lobbyists\u2019 federal lobbying expenditures and\nthe issues on which they have lobbied;\n\n\u2022 the principal financial services industry trade associations\nthat receive membership dues from Wells Fargo;\n                                                                \n  \u2022                                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  payments made to 527 Organizations;                           \n                                                                \n\u2022 a summary of the most recent campaign contributions of Wells\nFargo\u2019s PACs; and\n\n\u2022 ballot initiative contributions in amounts exceeding $25,000.\n\nWe review the public disclosures on our GRPP website annually,\nand enhance them when appropriate, taking into account factors\nsuch as regulatory and legal developments, market practice,\nother external developments, and engagement with our\nshareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nFor example, by the end of 2025, we will further enhance the\ndisclosures on our GRPP website to include, among other things:\n\n\u2022 our public policy priorities that inform our advocacy and\nparticipation in the public policy process;\n\n\u2022 instructions for accessing Wells Fargo federal lobbying\nreports; and\n\n\u2022 a statement clarifying that we restrict 501(c)(4)\nOrganizations from using payments to support or oppose any\ncandidate for U.S. federal, state, or local office and receive\nattestation letters confirming use of payments is consistent\nwith such restriction, in line with our disclosures regarding\n527 Organizations.\n\nIn addition, next year we plan to disclose on our GRPP website\nthe annual amount spent on federal lobbying activities.\n\nPreviously, in 2023, we enhanced our disclosures regarding Board\noversight, adding information about our decision-making\napproaches for political engagement. And more recently, in 2024,\nwe further enhanced the disclosures on our GRPP website, to\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 information about the approval process for our public policy-\noriented trade association memberships, which includes initial\nand annual approval by the Head of GRPP and Board committee-\nlevel oversight, and for each of our principal trade\nassociations, the percentage of dues paid that is attributable\nto lobbying;\n\n\u2022 a statement that Wells Fargo does not engage in direct\ngrassroots lobbying, and if we do engage in direct grassroots\nlobbying in the future, we will disclose such activity where and\nas required by law;\n\n\u2022 additional disclosures about advocacy and lobbying in the\nstate and local jurisdictions where we are registered to lobby,\nby including hyperlinks to the websites where our state and\nlocal lobbying disclosure reports are housed;\n                                                                \n  104Wells Fargo & Company                                      \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Shareholder Proposals                                         \n                                                                \n\u2022 information about Wells Fargo\u2019s established criteria guiding\nour decision-making for supporting candidates through the Wells\nFargo PACs, which includes supporting candidates who:\n\n\u2013 represent the communities where we have a large presence;\n\n\u2013 understand the important role the financial services industry\nplays in the economy;\n\n\u2013 are in legislative or political leadership roles; or\n\n\u2013 serve on important committees that have jurisdiction over\nissues that impact the financial services sector; and\n\n\u2022 information about the attestation letters that we obtain from\n527 Organizations, which affirm that our payments will only be\nused for operational and administrative purposes.\n\nThese disclosures are available on our GRPP website at\nhttps://www.wellsfargo.com/about/responsibility-and-\nimpact/government-relations/ .\n\nBased on our conversations with shareholders and the voting\noutcome for the 2024 Proposal and 2023 Proposal, we believe we\nprovide appropriate disclosures for understanding our political\nand public policy contributions, and that recent and upcoming\nenhancements to these disclosures have been responsive to\nshareholder feedback.\n\nOur Practices\n\nAs disclosed on our GRPP website, we do not use corporate money\nor resources to influence U.S. domestic or non-U.S. candidate\nelections, which includes assisting candidate campaign\ncommittees, political parties, caucuses, independent expenditure\nor other political committees. Wells Fargo sponsors PACs that\nmake contributions to candidates and only accept funding through\nvoluntary contributions by eligible employees and directors. As\nnoted above, we have established and published criteria guiding\nour decision-making for supporting candidates through the Wells\nFargo PACs.\n\nLike many companies, Wells Fargo engages in public policy\nadvocacy on issues that impact our business at the local, state,\nand federal levels, including through membership in financial\nservices industry trade associations. Given the nature of our\nbusiness as a global financial institution evolving to meet the\nfinancial needs of our customers, clients, and the communities\nwe serve, we believe it is important for us to engage on a broad\nrange of topics. We regularly review our participation model and\nbelieve that engagement through these trade organizations,\nincluding as a voice of opposition from time to time, is an\nintegral part of our public policy strategy. Participation in\nthese groups comes with the understanding that we may not always\nagree with every position taken.\n\nGiven our current disclosures regarding our political engagement\nand spending, which include recent enhancements implemented in\n2024, as well as our Board\u2019s role in overseeing these matters\nand our practices with respect to political spending, PAC\nsponsorship, issue advocacy, and industry trade association\nparticipation, we believe that the annual reporting requested by\nthe proposal would require us to devote meaningful time and\nresources that could be better utilized to advance key\npriorities. Therefore, we believe that this proposal is not in\nthe best interest of Wells Fargo or our shareholders.\n                                                                \n  Item\u00a05 \u2013 Shareholder Proposal \u2013 Annual Report on Congruency   \n  of Political Spending and Corporate Values                    \n  Our Board recommends that you voteAGAINSTthis proposal.       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement105                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Shareholder Proposals                                         \n                                                                \n                                                 \n  Item 6                                         \n  Shareholder Proposal \u2013 Energy Supply Ratio     \n  Our Board recommends that you voteAGAINSTthis  \n  proposal.                                      \n                                                 \nThe Comptroller of the City of New York, Municipal Building, One\nCentre Street, 8th Floor North, New York, NY 10007-2341, on\nbehalf of the New York City Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, the New\nYork City Employees\u2019 Retirement System, and the New York City\nPolice Pension Fund, the holders of 1,859,712 shares, 1,200,985\nshares, and 777,098 shares, respectively, has advised us that it\nintends to introduce the following resolution at the 2025 Annual\nMeeting:\n\nResolution and Supporting Statement\n\nResolved: Shareholders request Wells Fargo & Company (\u201cCompany\u201d)\ndisclose annually its Energy Supply Ratio (\u201cESR\u201d), defined as\nits total financing through equity and debt underwriting, and\nproject finance, in low-carbon energy supply relative to that in\nfossil-fuel energy supply. The disclosure, prepared at\nreasonable expense and excluding confidential information, shall\ndescribe Company\u2019s methodology, including what it classifies as\n\u201clow carbon\u201d or \u201cfossil fuel.\u201d Company should include lending in\nits ESR if methodologically sound.\n\nSupporting Statement:\n\nAs a major global bank, Company is broadly exposed to financial\nstability risks posed by climate change and has made certain\nclimate-related commitments. Banks aligning their activities\nwith their climate goals are better prepared to manage risk,\nincluding legal, reputational and financial risks associated\nwith climate change and capitalize on opportunities associated\nwith the global energy transition.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, reaching net zero\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 2050 requires rapid transition away\nfrom fossil fuels and tripling in global annual clean energy\ninvestment by 2030. 1 The pace at which low-carbon energy supply\nis scaled up will dictate the rate at which fossil fuels are\nphased down. 2\n\nCompany is reportedly among the largest global financiers of\nfossil fuels; however, it has committed to a goal of net zero by\n2050, including financed emissions, and has a goal to deploy\n$500 billion in sustainable finance by 2030. 3 Although Company\nhas robust commitments to sustainable finance, investors need\nfurther disclosure to assess its clean energy financing activity\nand relative financing of fossil fuels.\n\nThe ESR, a dollar-based metric, will complement and supplement\nCompany\u2019s existing emissions-based climate financial\ndisclosures, including any disclosures under European Union\nreporting requirements, and provide decision-useful disclosure\non Company\u2019s activities and progress toward its public\ncommitments. In recent years, banks reportedly earned more in\nlending and underwriting fees from clean energy projects than\nfrom oil and gas, and coal companies. 4 Investors seek to assess\nwhether Company is positioning itself as a leader in the energy\ntransition.\n\nThe ESR has become a key climate disclosure metric. Bloomberg\nprovides to its clients ESRs for global banks, including\nCompany, using a standardized methodology with clear definitions\nfor \u2018low carbon\u2019 and \u2018fossil fuel,\u2019 however, it excludes\nlending. 5 Three leading North American Banks, Citi, JPMorgan\nand Royal Bank of Canada committed to disclose an ESR, and their\nmethodology, demonstrating that disclosure is feasible and\nleading market practice.\n\nInvestors believe Company should similarly disclose its annual\nESR for which it is accountable, and work toward an industry-\nstandard approach for calculating and reporting it. Bloomberg\npublished an Implementation Guide 6 and the Institute of\nInternational Finance, a financial industry association with\naround 400 members globally, published a 2024 whitepaper that\nprovides a potential format for standardized disclosure of\nmethodological design choices. 7\n\n1. https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-roadmap-a-global-\npathway-to-keep-the-15-0c-goal-in-reach)\n\n2.

We\nbelieve that asking banks to calculate their own ratios will\nresult in different data sources and methodologies that would\ncreate confusion in the market, and would not provide beneficial\ninformation to shareholders.\n\n\u2022 The method of measuring and reporting our activity that the\nproposal would require does not align with our approach to\nfinancing, and would not be useful in managing or overseeing the\nCompany and would not add value for shareholders. We are\ntherefore concerned that it would not be an efficient use of\nCompany resources for us to internally develop and calculate a\nWells Fargo energy supply ratio.\n\n\u2022 Our existing public disclosures describe our client-centric\nclimate efforts. We believe these disclosures already provide\nuseful information for understanding our approach. Our climate-\nrelated efforts and disclosures also take into account\nconsiderations about complex legal and regulatory requirements\nto which we are subject. We expect these changing requirements\nto continue to evolve in the near future, and the ratio\nrequested by the proposal may not align with current legal and\nregulatory developments.\n\n\u2022 Our Board, directly and through its committees, provides\noversight of climate risk management matters, as well as\nmanagement of related risks.\n\n\u2022 We have proactively engaged with many of our shareholders to\nunderstand their views on this topic, and their feedback has\nbeen considered by the Board and has helped inform our response\nto this shareholder proposal.\n\nBetter Data Currently Publicly Available\n\nAs the shareholder proposal notes, an unaffiliated third-party\nprovider, BloombergNEF, already estimates and publishes a\nversion of an energy supply ratio for Wells Fargo, based on\ntheir own internally developed methodology. BloombergNEF also\ncalculates estimated energy supply ratios for other global banks\nusing this methodology, providing comparability when considering\nenergy supply financing activity across the market. To the\nextent market participants may be interested in understanding\nglobal energy supply financing activity, it is more effective\nfor a third party to consistently calculate an energy supply\nratio for large financial institutions, rather than individual\nbanks each independently developing their own company-specific\nmethodology.\n\nThe proposal acknowledges that there is no generally accepted\nframework or \u201cindustry-standard approach\u201d for calculating and\nreporting an energy supply ratio. As a result, requiring banks\nto independently calculate their own version of this ratio,\nwould, in addition to not being useful for shareholders,\npotentially result in less uniformity and lack of comparability\namong financial services companies by encouraging banks to build\ntheir own methodologies. For example, following extensive\nefforts, certain financial services companies have each recently\ndeveloped their own unique methodology to independently\ncalculate an energy supply ratio, which they have publicly\ndisclosed, resulting in distinct versions of the metric\nrequested by the proposal.\n\nConcerns about the Requested Metric\n\nThe ratio that the shareholder proposal would require us to\ncalculate and disclose does not align with our approach to\nfinancing, which is focused on client needs across a broad range\nof sectors of the U.S. economy. We offer a suite of banking\ncapabilities, including tailored solutions, to support relevant\nclients\u2019 production, delivery and adoption of low-carbon\nsolutions, and the requested ratio is not useful to accurately\nassess the efficacy of this approach.\n\nWe do not believe it would be an efficient use of resources for\nWells Fargo to internally develop and calculate our own ratio.\nThe resource-intensive task of developing our own firm-specific\nmethodology to estimate and disclose an energy supply ratio\nwould not be useful in managing or overseeing the Company, would\nnot add value for shareholders, and would be a poor use of\nCompany resources.\n                                                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement107                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Shareholder Proposals                                         \n                                                                \nOur Sustainability Disclosures\n\nWe have devoted significant resources to developing public\ndisclosures describing our approach to sustainability. Our\ndisclosures take into account business, legal and regulatory\ncompliance, stakeholder perspectives, market practices, accepted\nreporting standards and frameworks and available data, among\nother considerations. More information is available at\nhttps://www.wellsfargo.com/about/responsibility-and-\nimpact/reporting-and-resources/ .\n\nWe believe our disclosures already provide transparency and\ninsight into Wells Fargo\u2019s approach to climate. More information\nabout our climate approach is available at\nhttps://www.wellsfargo.com/about/responsibility-and-\nimpact/sustainability/ .\n\nWith respect to legal and regulatory compliance considerations\nin particular, we are a global financial institution subject to\nsignificant, and changing, federal, state, local, and\ninternational laws and regulations, including such laws and\nregulations relating to climate risk. Our climate-related\nefforts and disclosures take into account considerations about\nthese complex legal and regulatory requirements. We expect\nrelevant legal and regulatory requirements to continue to evolve\nacross jurisdictions in the near future, and the ratio requested\nby the proposal may not align with these anticipated\ndevelopments.\n\nBoard and Committee Oversight\n\nOur Board provides oversight of climate-related risk management\nmatters directly and through its committees. To facilitate its\noversight of climate-related risk management, the Board,\ndirectly or through one of its committees, receives regular\nupdates from our leaders on climate-related disclosures and\nother environmental sustainability and climate-related risk\nmanagement matters.\n\nThe Board\u2019s Risk Committee reviews and approves the Wells Fargo\nrisk management framework, which sets forth the Company\u2019s core\nprinciples for managing and governing risk, including risks\nrelated to impacts from climate change and our efforts to\nintegrate climate-related considerations into risk management\nprograms. The Risk Committee supports the stature, authority,\nand independence of the Company\u2019s Independent Risk Management\nfunction, which includes the Climate Risk Oversight group.\n\nShareholder Engagement\n\nWhile this shareholder proposal was not submitted to Wells Fargo\nfor the 2024 annual shareholder meeting, some of our peers\nreceived a similar proposal from the proponent in 2024, and we\nhave proactively engaged with our shareholders on this topic. As\ndescribed in the Shareholder Engagement section of this Proxy\nStatement, shareholders expressed mixed perspectives on banks\nindependently calculating and disclosing an energy supply ratio,\nwith some concerns about lack of comparability and no consensus\nperspective on the utility of this ratio for shareholders. We\nalso engaged twice with the proponent. The GNC and the CRC\nreviewed and discussed this shareholder feedback and the current\nproposal. All of this information has informed the Board\u2019s\nrecommendation against this proposal.\n\nOverall, we are concerned that implementing this proposal asking\nfor banks to independently calculate their own energy supply\nratios would contribute to a lack of comparability across the\nindustry, and for Wells Fargo would result in disclosure of a\nratio that does not align with our client-centered approach to\nfinancing. Therefore, we believe that the report requested by\nthe proposal is unnecessary and would require us to devote\nmeaningful time and resources that could be better utilized to\nadvance key priorities. We believe that the proposal is not in\nthe best interest of Wells Fargo or our shareholders, or other\nstakeholders.\n                                                           \n  Item\u00a06 \u2013 Shareholder Proposal \u2013 Energy Supply Ratio      \n  Our Board recommends that you voteAGAINSTthis proposal.  \n                                                           \n                                                                \n  108Wells Fargo & Company                                      \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Table of Contents                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Shareholder Proposals                                         \n                                                                \n                                                 \n  Item 7                                         \n  Shareholder Proposal \u2013 Report on Respecting    \n  Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights                     \n  Our Board recommends that you voteAGAINSTthis  \n  proposal.                                      \n                                                 \nAmerican Baptist Home Mission Societies, 1075 First Avenue, King\nof Prussia, PA 19406, the holder of 127 shares of our common\nstock, and two co-filers have advised us that they intend to\nintroduce the following resolution at the 2025 Annual Meeting:\n\nResolution and Supporting Statement\n\nResolved: Shareholders request the Board of Directors provide a\nreport to shareholders, at reasonable cost and omitting\nproprietary and confidential information, outlining the\neffectiveness of Wells Fargo\u2019s policies, practices, and\nperformance indicators in respecting internationally-recognized\nhuman rights standards for Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights in its\nexisting and proposed general corporate and project financing.\n\nWhereas: The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\nand International Labour Organization Convention 169 concerning\nIndigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries are\ninternationally-recognized standards for Indigenous Peoples\u2019\nrights. 1 Violation of these rights presents risks for Wells\nFargo that can adversely affect shareholder value, including\nreputational damage, project disruptions, litigation, and civil\nand criminal liability. 2 Wells Fargo has a history of financing\nprojects and companies that violate Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights,\nnotably as a lead financier of the Dakota Access pipeline in\n2016, which resulted in two cities withdrawing $2 billion in\nassets from the bank. 3 Several years later, Wells Fargo\nprovided over $3.86 billion in financing to Enbridge, enabling\nthe widely opposed Enbridge Line 3 and Line 5 pipeline reroutes.\n4\n\nEnbridge Line 3\u2019s construction and operation violate numerous\nIndigenous Peoples\u2019 rights, including the rights to free, prior,\nand informed consent (FPIC); self-determination; health;\nculture; religion; security; and assembly. 5 Similarly,\nIndigenous leaders from the Great Lakes tribes have called\nEnbridge\u2019s Line 5 project \u201can act of cultural genocide.\u201d 6 A\n2023 ruling found that Line 5 was operating illegally on Bad\nRiver Band territory since 2013 and ordered Enbridge to pay over\n$5 million and to cease operating Line 5 on the reservation by\n2026. 7 Michigan Governor Whitmer canceled Enbridge\u2019s\ncertification in 2020, citing \u201cEnbridge\u2019s historic failures and\ncurrent non-compliance\u201d as jeopardizing the safety of residents\nand the environment. 8 Significant material social risks have\nalready materialized for Enbridge and its financiers through\nlitigation, ongoing opposition led by Indigenous Peoples,\nallegations of civil rights abuses, treaty violation\ninvestigations, and environmental damages. 9\n\nInvestor expectations on this issue are increasing, as\ninstitutions develop screens against companies with patterns of\nviolating Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights. 10 BlackRock\u2019s 2021\nInvestment Stewardship Statement included an expectation for\ncompanies to respect FPIC in business decisions that impact\nIndigenous Peoples. 11\n\n1. https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/declara\ntion-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples.html;\n\nhttps://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=\nNORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312314\n\n2. https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/sites/default/files/atta\nched-files/social_cost_and_material_loss_0.pdf ;\nhttps://amazonwatch.org/news/2022/0622-the-business-case-for-\nindigenous-rights\n\n3. https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-\nway/2017/02/08/514133514/two-cities-vote-to-pull-more-\nthan-3-billion-from-wells-fargo-over-dakota-pipelin\n\n4. https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/RAN-\nBriefing_Line3_KXL.pdf\n\n5. https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/sites/default/files/atta\nched-files/cerd_request_line_3_pipeline.pdf\n\n6. https://www.theguardian.com/us-\nnews/2021/feb/19/1ine-3-pipeline-ojibwe-tribal-lands\n\n7. https://www.wpr.org/news/federal-court-arguments-bad-river-\nenbridge-appeal-line-5-shutdown;

Wells Fargo previously adhered to the Equator\nPrinciples to manage environmental and social risk. However, in\n2024, it withdrew from the Principles, raising concerns that it\n\u201cbackpedals on commitments on climate and to vulnerable\ncommunities affected by their financing deals.\u201d 12 Wells Fargo\u2019s\nrecent Invest Native initiative 13 does not shield the company\nfrom material risk connected to insufficient due diligence on\nIndigenous Peoples\u2019 rights. Effective policies protecting\nIndigenous Peoples\u2019 rights are critical to meeting Wells Fargo\u2019s\ncommitments and mitigating material risk to shareholders.\n\nOur Statement in Opposition\n\nReport on Respecting Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights\n\nOur Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal, identified as\nItem 7 on the proxy card.\n\n\u2022 Following the submission of substantially the same proposal at\nthe 2024 annual shareholder meeting, which did not receive\nmajority support, we engaged with many of our shareholders to\nunderstand their views and share our perspective on this topic.\nThese engagements helped inform our response to the current\nproposal. During our conversations, shareholders generally did\nnot convey expectations for the report requested by the\nproposal.\n\n\u2022 We seek to respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples, and we\nstrive to take these rights into account when conducting our\nbusiness activities. Our Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Statement\nunderscores the importance of respecting Indigenous Peoples\u2019\nrights, and we have existing policies, practices and procedures\nto help us identify and assess potential risks to Indigenous\ncommunities. We periodically review and evaluate these policies\nand procedures consistent with our standard policy management\nprocess and our enterprise\u2011wide risk and control framework.\n\n\u2022 Our Board and its committees provide oversight of social and\npublic responsibility matters, including issues impacting\nIndigenous communities, and have considered this topic and\nrelated shareholder feedback in connection with this proposal.\n\n\u2022 We have served Indigenous Peoples\u2019 communities in the United\nStates for more than 65 years, and we seek to help these\ncommunities achieve financial sustainability and prosperity.\n\nShareholder Engagement\n\nAt our 2024 and 2022 annual shareholder meetings, shareholders\nvoted on substantially the same shareholder proposal (the 2024\nProposal and the 2022 Proposal , respectively), both of which\nwere submitted by the proponent. Neither the 2024 Proposal nor\nthe 2022 Proposal received majority support, with a decline in\nsupport in 2024. Based on our engagement with shareholders to\ndiscuss the prior proposals, we believe the strength of our\nexisting approach and disclosures is responsive to shareholder\nfeedback in a manner that is appropriately aligned with our\nstrategic and risk priorities. As described in the Shareholder\nEngagement section of this Proxy Statement, we have continued to\nengage with our shareholders and during these conversations,\nshareholders generally did not convey expectations for the\nreport requested by the proposal. We also engaged again with the\nproponent. The GNC and the CRC reviewed and discussed the 2024\nand 2022 Proposals, the vote results, shareholder feedback, and\nthe current proposal. All of this has information has informed\nthe Board\u2019s recommendation against this proposal.\n\nOur Framework Regarding Respect for Indigenous Peoples\n\nWe seek to respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples, and we\nstrive to take these rights into account when conducting our\nbusiness activities. In acknowledgement of these rights, we\nadopted and published our Indigenous Peoples Statement in\npartnership with tribal leaders, indigenous communities\u2019\nstakeholders and their representatives. The Indigenous Peoples\nStatement articulates Wells Fargo\u2019s commitment to treating all\nIndigenous Peoples with dignity and respect, as well as our\napproach to responsible financing.\n\nAdditionally, through our Human Rights Statement, which was\nreviewed by the CRC and updated in fall 2024, we articulate our\ncommitment to respecting human rights in our operations and\nthrough our business relationships, including our respect for\nthe rights of Indigenous Peoples in conducting our business\nactivities.

To help us identify,\nevaluate, and manage complex issues relating to Indigenous\nPeoples\u2019 rights and other areas in our financing and investment\nbusinesses, we have established risk management policies,\npractices, and procedur es that involve our business groups and\ninclude, as applicable, enhanced due diligence and management\nlevel review.\n\nBoard and Committee Oversight\n\nOur Board, through the applicable committee, oversees our\nsignificant strategies, policies, and programs on social and\npublic responsibility matters, including human rights and\nIndigenous Peoples\u2019 rights. In furtherance of these oversight\nresponsibilities, the CRC reviewed our Human Rights Statement\nand Indigenous Peoples Statement. Additionally, the Risk\nCommittee oversees our risk management framework, including\namong other things, our risk management program and governance\nstructures used by management to execute our risk management\nprogram.\n\nServing Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Communities\n\nFor more than 65 years, Wells Fargo has provided capital and\nfinancial services to tribes and tribal-owned enterprises. Wells\nFargo has banking relationships with 1 out of 3 federally\nrecognized tribes in the United States. We have committed\napproximately $4.6 billion in credit and hold approximately $3.8\nbillion in deposits for tribal governments and tribally owned\nenterprises nationally, banking more than 300 Native American\nand Alaska Native tribal entities in 32 U.S. states. We are\ndedicated to serving Indigenous communities with products,\nservices, and financial health programs tailored to help tribal\nclients, tribal governments, tribal enterprises, and tribal\nmembers succeed financially.\n\nAdditionally, between 2017 and 2022 we provided more than $50\nmillion to nonprofit organizations serving American Indian,\nAlaska Native, and Native Hawaiian communities, and in January\n2023, we launched Invest Native, through which we have provided\nan additional $20 million in philanthropy to advance economic\nopportunities in Native American communities through work with\nNative\u2011led organizations.\n\nWe believe that we are addressing the risks to Indigenous\ncommunities described in the proposal through our Board\noversight, our existing policies and procedures to evaluate and\nmitigate potential risks, and our ongoing commitment to\nIndigenous communities. Therefore, we believe that the report\nrequested by the proposal is unnecessary and would require us to\ndevote meaningful time and resources that could be better\nutilized to advance key priorities. We believe that this\nproposal is not in the best interest of Wells Fargo, our\nshareholders, or other stakeholders.\n                                                                \n  Item\u00a07 \u2013 Shareholder Proposal \u2013 Report on Respecting          \n  Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights                                    \n  Our Board recommends that you voteAGAINSTthis proposal.       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement111                                       \n                                                                \nTable of Contents\n\nInformation About Related Persons\n                                                                \n   Related Person Transaction Policy and Procedures             \n                                                                \nOur Board has adopted a written policy and procedures for the\nreview and approval of transactions between our Company and its\nrelated persons and/or their respective affiliated entities.

( Vanguard )),\nand some of their respective immediate family members and/or\naffiliated entities had loans, other extensions of credit,\nand/or other banking or financial services transactions with our\nbanking and other subsidiaries in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, including deposit and treasury management services,\nbrokerage, investment advisory, capital markets, sales and\ntrading, and investment banking transactions. All of these\nlending, banking, and financial services transactions were on\nsubstantially the same terms, including interest rates,\ncollateral, and repayment (as applicable), as those available at\nthe time for comparable transactions with persons not related to\nour Company, and did not involve more than the normal risk of\ncollectability or present other unfavorable features. In the\nordinary course of business, we also sell or purchase other\nproducts and services, including the purchase of investment\nmanagement technology products and advisory services from\nBlackRock and its affiliates. We and our customers also may\ninvest in mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other\nproducts affiliated with BlackRock, FMR, and Vanguard, and we\nand such firms may receive fees in connection with those\ninvestments, in the ordinary course of business. All of these\ntransactions were entered into on an arm\u2019s-length basis and\nunder customary terms and conditions.\n\nFamily and Other Relationships\n\nFor information about an outstanding pension plan balance\nbetween Mr. Craver and a legacy predecessor company, please\nrefer to the Director Independence section of this Proxy\nStatement.

SEC\nregulations also require us to identify in this Proxy Statement\nany person subject to this requirement who failed to file any\nsuch report on a timely basis. To our knowledge, based solely on\na review of the filed reports and written representations by the\npersons required to file these reports, we believe that each of\nour directors and executive officers complied with all such\nfiling requirements during 2024, except the following: (i) for\nFabian Garcia, one late filing reporting a single transaction\nwhich related to the deferral of his quarterly retainer that was\nreported on one Form 4, and (ii) for CeCelia Morken, an amended\nForm 3 was filed to report certain holdings in a broker-managed\naccount that were inadvertently omitted from her initial, timely\nfiled Form 3, and one late filing reporting a single transaction\nthrough a broker-managed account that was reported on one Form\n4. In each such case, the report was promptly filed or amended\nafter the reporting person became aware of the transaction or\nerror.\n\nDirectors and Executive Officers\n\nStock Ownership Requirements and Other Policies\n\nStock Ownership Requirements\n\nTo reinforce the long-term perspective of stock-based\ncompensation and emphasize the relationship between the\ninterests of our directors and executive officers with your\ninterests as shareholders, we require our non-employee directors\nand our executive officers to own shares of our common stock.\nOur Board has adopted robust stock ownership policies that apply\nto our directors, as summarized in Director Stock Ownership\nPolicy , and executive officers, as summarized in Stock\nOwnership Policy .\n\nAnti-Hedging Policies\n\nTo further strengthen the alignment between stock ownership and\nyour interests as shareholders, our Code of Conduct requirements\nprohibit all employees, including our executive officers and\ndirectors, from engaging in derivative or hedging transactions\ninvolving any Company securities, including Wells Fargo common\nstock. This hedging prohibition with respect to Company\nsecurities applies to any type of transaction in securities that\nlimits investment risk with the use of derivatives, such as\noptions, puts, calls, futures contracts, or other similar\ninstruments.\n\nNo Pledging Policy\n\nOur Board has adopted policies that are reflected in our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines that prohibit our directors and\nexecutive officers from pledging Company equity securities as\ncollateral for margin or other similar loan transactions.\n\nInsider Trading Policy\n\nThe Company has adopted insider trading policies and procedures\ngoverning the purchase, sale, and/or other dispositions of the\nCompany\u2019s securities by directors, officers, employees, and the\nCompany itself, that we believe are reasonably designed to\npromote compliance with insider trading laws, rules and\nregulations, and the listing standards of the NYSE applicable to\nus. These policies and procedures are reflected in (i) the\nsection of our Code of Conduct related to insider trading and\nother trading restrictions, which is applicable to all employees\nand directors; (ii) our Insider Trading Activity Policy, which\nis applicable to directors, officers, and certain other\nemployees; and (iii) our Company Securities Issuance and\nRepurchase Policy, which is applicable to transactions by the\nCompany.

Our Corporate Governance Guidelines\nprovide that our Board will nominate for election, and appoint\nto fill Board vacancies or newly created directorships, only\nthose directors who have tendered or agreed to tender an\nirrevocable resignation that would become effective upon their\nfailure to receive the required vote for election and Board\nacceptance of the tendered resignation. Each director nominee\nnamed in this Proxy Statement has tendered an irrevocable\nresignation as a director in accordance with our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, which resignation will become effective\nif he or she fails to receive the required vote for election at\nthe Annual Meeting and our Board accepts his or her resignation.\n\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines also provide that the GNC\nwill consider the tendered resignation of a director who fails\nto receive the required number of votes for election, as well as\nany other offer to resign that is conditioned upon Board\nacceptance, and will recommend to our Board whether or not to\naccept such resignation. The director whose resignation is under\nconsideration will abstain from participating in any decision of\nthe GNC or our Board regarding such resignation. If our Board\ndoes not accept the resignation, the director will continue to\nserve until his or her successor is elected and qualified. Our\nBoard will publicly disclose its decision regarding a\nresignation tendered by a director who fails to receive the\nrequired number of votes for re-election within 90 days after\ncertification of the shareholder voting results.\n                                                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement121                                       \n                                                                \nTable of Contents\n                                                                \n  Voting and Other Meeting Information                          \n                                                                \nWhat is the effect of Broker Non-Votes?\n\nUnder NYSE rules, member-brokers are prohibited from voting a\ncustomer\u2019s shares on non-routine items (referred to as a \u201cbroker\nnon-vote\u201d) if the customer has not given the broker voting\ninstructions on that matter. A broker may vote customer shares\nin its discretion on any routine items if the customer does not\ninstruct the broker how to vote, though the broker may opt not\nto do so. Whether brokers have discretion to vote the shares on\nuninstructed matters is subject to NYSE rules and a final\ndetermination by the NYSE. Therefore, unless you provide\nspecific voting instructions, your shares may not be represented\nor voted at the Annual Meeting. Broker-non votes, if any, will\nnot be counted in determining the outcome of the vote on the\nelection of directors or on any of the other proposals.\n\nMay I change my vote?\n\nYes. If you are the record holder of the shares, you may revoke\nyour proxy and change your vote by:\n\n\u2022 Submitting timely written notice of revocation to our\nCorporate Secretary at MAC #J0193-610, 30 Hudson Yards, New\nYork, NY 10001, prior to the vote at the Annual Meeting or to\nofficeofthecorporatesecretary@wellsfargo.com ;\n\n\u2022 If you completed and returned a proxy card, submitting a new\nproxy card with a later date and returning it prior to the vote\nat the Annual Meeting;\n\n\u2022 If you submitted your proxy over the internet, by mobile\ndevice, or by telephone, submitting another later-dated proxy\nover the internet, by mobile device, or by telephone by the\napplicable deadline shown in the table above; or\n\n\u2022 Attending the Annual Meeting as a shareholder and voting your\nshares online during the Annual Meeting. See Annual Meeting\nLogistics above for more information on how to attend, vote, and\nask questions during the Annual Meeting. Attending the Annual\nMeeting alone will not revoke your proxy.\n\nIf you are a street name holder, you may revoke your voting\ninstructions and change your vote by submitting new voting\ninstructions to your brokerage firm, bank, or other similar\nentity before the deadline shown above or you may change your\nvoting instructions by attending the Annual Meeting and voting\nonline during the meeting, provided that you log into the\nmeeting as a shareholder using your valid control number\nincluded in your proxy materials.\n\nIf you participate in the Company Plans, you may revoke your\nvoting instructions and change your vote by submitting new\nvoting instructions to the trustee or custodian of the\napplicable plan before the deadline shown above .\n                                                                \n  122Wells Fargo & Company                                      \n                                                                \nTable of Contents\n                                                                \n  Voting and Other Meeting Information                          \n                                                                \nProposals and Nominations for the 2026 Annual Meeting\n\nWe have summarized below the requirements and timing for\nshareholders to submit proposals or director nominations for the\n2026 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

We have retained Sodali &\nCo. to help the Board solicit proxies. We expect to pay\napproximately $30,000 plus out-of-pocket expenses for its help.\nBoard members and our employees may also solicit proxies for us\nby mail, telephone, email, or in person. We will not pay our\ndirectors or employees any extra amounts for soliciting proxies.\nWe may, upon request, reimburse brokerage firms, banks, or\nsimilar entities representing street name holders for their\nexpenses in forwarding the notice of internet availability of\nproxy materials or proxy materials to their customers who are\nstreet name holders and obtaining their voting instructions.\n\nElectronic Delivery of Proxy Materials\n\nWe use the SEC notice and access rule that allows us to furnish\nour proxy materials to our shareholders over the internet\ninstead of mailing paper copies of those materials. As a result,\nbeginning on or about March 19, 2025, we sent to our\nshareholders of record a notice of internet availability of\nproxy materials containing instructions on how to access our\nproxy materials over the internet and vote online. This notice\nis not a proxy card and cannot be used to vote your shares. If\nyou received a notice only, you will not receive paper copies of\nthe proxy materials unless you request the materials by\nfollowing the instructions on the notice or on the website\nreferred to on the notice.\n\nWe provided some of our shareholders, including shareholders who\nhave previously requested to receive paper copies of the proxy\nmaterials and some of our shareholders who are participants in\nour benefit plans, with paper copies of the proxy materials\ninstead of a notice that the materials are electronically\navailable over the internet. If you received paper copies of the\nproxy materials, we encourage you to help us save money and\nreduce the environmental impact of delivering paper proxy\nmaterials to shareholders by signing up to receive all of your\nfuture proxy materials electronically, as described below.\n\nIf you own shares of common stock in more than one account\u2013for\nexample, in a joint account with your spouse and in your\nindividual brokerage account\u2013you may have received more than one\nnotice or more than one set of paper proxy materials. To vote\nall of your shares by proxy, please follow each of the separate\nproxy voting instructions that you received for your shares of\ncommon stock held in each of your different accounts.\n\nHow to Receive Future Proxy Materials Electronically\n\nShareholders can sign up to receive proxy materials\nelectronically and receive an email prior to next year\u2019s annual\nmeeting with links to the proxy materials, which may provide\nfaster delivery of the materials and will help us save printing\nand mailing costs and conserve natural resources. Your election\nto receive proxy materials by email will remain in effect until\nyou terminate your election. To receive proxy materials by email\nin the future, you may either go to www.proxyvote.com and follow\nthe instructions to enroll for electronic delivery or follow the\ninstructions on the notice, or if a street name holder, contact\nyour brokerage firm, bank, or other similar entity that holds\nyour shares.\n\nIf you have previously agreed to electronic delivery of our\nproxy materials, but wish to receive paper copies of these\nmaterials for the Annual Meeting or for future meetings, please\nfollow the instructions on the website referred to on the\nelectronic notice you received.\n                                                                \n  124Wells Fargo & Company                                      \n                                                                \nTable of Contents\n                                                                \n  Voting and Other Meeting Information                          \n                                                                \nHouseholding\n\nSEC rules allow a single copy of the proxy materials or the\nnotice of internet availability of proxy materials to be\ndelivered to multiple shareholders sharing the same address and\nlast name, or who we reasonably believe are members of the same\nfamily and who consent to receiving a single copy of these\nmaterials in a manner provided by these rules. This practice\nknown as \u201chouseholding\u201d can result in significant savings of\npaper and mailing costs.\n\nBecause we are using the SEC\u2019s notice and access rule, we will\nnot household our proxy materials or notices to shareholders of\nrecord sharing an address. This means that shareholders of\nrecord who share an address will each be mailed a separate\nnotice or paper copy of the proxy materials. However, we\nunderstand that certain brokerage firms, banks, or other similar\nentities holding our common stock for their customers may\nhousehold proxy materials or notices.\n\nShareholders sharing an address whose shares of our common stock\nare held by such an entity should contact such entity if they\nnow receive (1) multiple copies of our proxy materials or\nnotices and wish to receive only one copy of these materials per\nhousehold in the future, or (2) a single copy of our proxy\nmaterials or notice and wish to receive separate copies of these\nmaterials in the future.

Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure and represents total equity less preferred\nequity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable\nintangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights) and\ngoodwill and other intangibles on investments in consolidated\nportfolio companies, net of applicable deferred taxes. One of\nthese ratios is return on average tangible common equity\n(ROTCE), which represents our annualized earnings as a\npercentage of tangible common equity. The methodology of\ndetermining tangible common equity may differ among companies.\nManagement believes that ROTCE is a useful financial measure\nbecause it enables management, investors, and others to assess\nthe Company\u2019s use of equity.\n\nFor purposes of measuring performance, as provided in our 2022\nLTIP or the applicable form of award agreement, ROTCE may be\nfurther adjusted by the HRC, in its discretion, for the effect\nof (i) losses resulting from discontinued operations, (ii) the\ncumulative effect of significant changes in generally accepted\naccounting principles, and (iii) any other unusual or\ninfrequently occurring gain or loss which is separately\nidentified and quantified. Under the terms of Mr. Scharf\u2019s offer\nletter, ROTCE for purposes of his Performance Shares is adjusted\nto exclude the impact of any penalties or other charges related\nto litigation, investigations or examinations arising out of\nretail sales practices of the Company or other material\nregulatory matters related to the conduct of the Company during\nperiods prior to his employment.\n\nIn addition, the HRC believed it was useful to consider certain\nnotable items that occurred during 2024 and 2023 in order to\nbetter assess the Company\u2019s underlying financial performance for\n2024, including as compared with 2023. Adjusted Noninterest\nExpense, Adjusted Pre-Tax Pre-Provision Profit, Adjusted Net\nIncome, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted ROE, Adjusted ROTCE, and\nAdjusted Efficiency Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures and\nrepresent our reported financial results adjusted for these\nnotable items. We believe that these adjusted financial measures\nare useful because they enabled the HRC as well as management,\ninvestors, and others to better assess the Company\u2019s underlying\nfinancial performance for 2024, particularly for the purposes of\nanalyzing 2024 compensation decisions.\n\n2024 Notable Items\n\n\u2022 FDIC special assessment of $243 million (pre-tax)\n\n2023 Notable Items\n\n\u2022 FDIC special assessment of $1.9 billion (pre-tax)\n                                                                \n  126Wells Fargo & Company                                      \n                                                                \nTable of Contents\n                                                                \n   Notes on Non-GAAP Financial Measures                         \n                                                                \nThe tables below provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to GAAP financial measures.\n                                                                \n  Notes on Non-GAAP Financial Measures                          \n                                                                \nAdjusted noninterest expense, adjusted pre-tax pre-provision\nprofit, and adjusted efficiency ratio ($ in millions)\n                                                                \n                       Year                                     \n                       ended                                    \n                       Dec 31,                      Dec 31,     \n                       2024                            2023     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Revenue    -A                    $  82,296         82,597     \n  Nonint\u2026    -B                       54,598         55,562     \n  expense                                                       \n  Adjust\u2026                                                       \n  for                                                           \n  notable                                                       \n  items:                                                        \n  Federal                                                       \n  Deposit                                                       \n  Insura\u2026                                                       \n  Corpor\u2026                                243          1,931     \n  (FDIC)                                                        \n  special                                                       \n  assess\u2026                                                       \n  Adjust\u2026                                                       \n  nonint\u2026    -C                       54,355         53,631     \n  expense                                                       \n  Effici\u2026    -B)/(A                       66  %          67  %  \n  ratio                                                         \n  Adjust\u2026                                                       \n  effici\u2026    -C)/(A                       66  %          65  %  \n  ratio                                                         \n  Pre-tax                                                       \n  pre-pr\u2026    -A)-(B                   27,698         27,035     \n  profit                                                        \n  (PTPP)1                                                       \n  Adjust\u2026    -A)-(C                   27,941         28,966     \n  PTPP                                                          \n                                                                \n1.

Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate\nand composite state income tax rates to the difference between\nbook and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible\nassets at period end.\n                                                                \n  128Wells Fargo & Company                                      \n                                                                \nTable of Contents\n\nAdditional Information\n\n1. Pre-Tax Pre-Provision Profit (PTPP) is total revenue less\nnoninterest expense. Management believes that PTPP is a useful\nfinancial measure because it enables investors and others to\nassess the Company\u2019s ability to generate capital to cover credit\nlosses through a credit cycle.\n\n2. Return on Equity (ROE) represents Wells Fargo net income\napplicable to common stock divided by average common\nstockholders\u2019 equity.\n\n3. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio is calculated under the\nStandardized Approach which is our binding CET1 ratio. CET1\nratio is a regulatory calculation used by management, investors,\nregulators, and others to assess the Company\u2019s capital position.\nFor additional information on our CET1 ratio, see the \u201cCapital\nManagement - Risk-Based Capital and Risk-Weighted Assets\u201d\nsection in the Company\u2019s 2024 Annual Report to Shareholders\nfiled as Exhibit 13 to the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n4. Efficiency Ratio is noninterest expense divided by total\nrevenue (net interest income and noninterest income).\n\n5. Net Operating Loss (NOL) means for any year in the\nPerformance Period, that the Company reports a net loss in the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated financial statements, and a net loss\ncontinues to exist after eliminating the effect of the following\nitems, each determined based on generally accepting accounting\nprinciples: (i) losses resulting from discontinued operations;\n(ii) the cumulative effect of changes in generally accepted\naccounting principles; and (iii) any other unusual or infrequent\nloss which is separately identified and quantified.\n\n6. Total Shareholder Return (TSR ) for Performance Share Awards\ngranted in 1Q 2025 for Performance Year 2024, means, for the\nCompany and each of the other Financial Performance Group\nCompanies, (a) (i) the company\u2019s average closing price of a\nshare of common stock (as reported in such reliable source as\ndetermined by the HRC, in its sole discretion) over the last 20\nconsecutive trading days, ending on December 31, 2027 (\u201cEnd\nPrice\u201d), minus (ii) the company\u2019s average closing price of a\nshare of common stock (as reported in such reliable source as\ndetermined by the Committee, in its sole discretion) over the\nfirst 20 consecutive trading days occurring in calendar year\n2025 (\u201cBase Price\u201d), plus the value of any dividends declared on\nsuch common stock in respect of an ex-dividend date occurring\nduring the Performance Period, as adjusted assuming such\ndividends were reinvested in shares of common stock of the\nissuing company on such ex-dividend date (\u201cReinvested\nDividends\u201d), divided by (b) the Base Price (in each case, with\nsuch adjustments as are appropriate, in the judgment of the\nCommittee in its sole discretion, to equitably calculate TSR in\nlight of any stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock\ndividends, and other extraordinary transactions or other changes\nin the capital structure of the company, as applicable).\n
