You should\ncarefully consider and evaluate all of the information included and\nincorporated by reference in this\nprospectus, including the risk factors incorporated by reference from our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as updated\nby our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other filings we make\nwith the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \u0093\u0094). We encourage you to read these risk factors in their\nentirety. In addition to these risks, other risks and uncertainties not\npresently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely\naffect our business operations and financial condition.

The dollars you invest will go\ntowards purchasing whole and fractional shares. Each investment can be for as\nlittle as $25. Your total investment for any calendar year is limited to\n$120,000. For purposes of applying the $120,000 annual maximum, we will\ncombine all investments, including initial and additional investments, but we\nwill exclude dividend reinvestments.

The funds will be\ninvested on the next investment date (see Question 10) that is at least three\n(3) business days after the withdrawal is made. Changes in or a\ndiscontinuation of automatic withdrawals can be made online, by telephone or\nby using the Transaction Request Formattached to your statement. To be\neffective with respect to a particular investment date, the Plan\nAdministrator must receive a change request at least 15 trading days prior to\nthe investment date.

All common stock purchased\nunder this Plan will be held by the Plan Administrator for the benefit of all\nparticipants together in its name or in the name of its nominee. The Plan\nAdministrator shall have no liability in connection with any inability to\npurchase common stock, the timing of any purchases or the value of Wells\nFargo common stock acquired for the participant\u0092s account. If any optional\ncash investment, including payment by check or automatic withdrawal, is\nreturned for any reason, the Plan Administrator will remove from the\nparticipant\u0092s account any common stock purchased with such funds, and will\nsell these shares. The Plan Administrator may also sell additional common\nstock in the account to recover a returned funds fee for each optional cash\ninvestment returned unpaid for any reason and may sell additional shares as\nnecessary to cover any market loss incurred by the Plan Administrator. 5\n\nParticipants\u0092 funds held by the Plan Administrator will not earn interest.\nDuring the period that an optional cash investment is pending, the collected\nfunds in the possession of the Plan Administrator may be invested in certain\nPermitted Investments. For purposes of this Plan, \u0093Permitted Investments\u0094\nshall mean the Plan Administrator may hold the funds uninvested or invested\nin select Wells Fargo deposit products. The risk of any loss from such\nPermitted Investments shall be the responsibility of the Plan Administrator.\nInvestment income from such Permitted Investments shall be retained by the\nPlan Administrator. Purchases by Wells Fargo employees and affiliates must be\nmade in compliance with Wells Fargo\u0092s Insider Trading Policy. In addition to\nother limitations, the Insider Trading Policy provides that the employee or\naffiliate may not trade in Wells Fargo\u0092s common stock if in possession of\nmaterial, non-publicinformation about Wells Fargo.\n                                                  \n  8.  What are my dividend reinvestment options?  \n                                                  \nThe Plan Administrator will apply all or a portion of your dividends, as\nelected (less any applicable fee), to purchase additional whole or fractional\nshares. Dividends are invested as soon as administratively possible on or\nfollowing the dividend payment date, and no later than 30 trading days\nfollowing the dividend payable date. Depending on the number of shares being\npurchased and the current trading volume, a purchase may be executed in\nmultiple transactions that may occur on more than one day. Should this occur,\nthe price will be the weighted average of all trades executed. The\nreinvestment option you elect will apply to all your Wells Fargo shares \u0096\nwhether held in certificate form, in direct registration or in the Plan. If\nyou do not select an option, the Plan Administrator will default your choice\nto full reinvestment.\n                                                                             \n      Full dividend reinvestment. If you elect full dividend reinvestment,   \n      all cash dividends payable on                                          \n      shares held in the Plan, along with any shares held in physical        \n      certificate form or through book-entry Direct Registration Shares      \n      (\u0093DRS\u0094), will be used to purchase additional shares.

The participant chooses to have 50% of the total dividend\nreinvested. This will equate to 75 shares having dividends reinvested and 75\nshares having dividends paid in cash.\n                                                                             \n      No Dividend Reinvestment.

Notices received after a dividend record date will not be\neffective until after that cash dividend has been paid. 6\n                                \n  9.  When are dividends paid?  \n                                \nHistorically, Wells Fargo has paid dividends on the first day of March, June,\nSeptember and December to stockholders of record on the first or second\nFriday of February, May, August and November, respectively. The dividend\npayment date and dividend record date may change in the future. To have your\ncash dividends reinvested, the Plan Administrator must receive your Account\nAuthorization Formauthorizing dividend reinvestment on or before the dividend\nrecord date. The payment of dividends on Wells Fargo common stock is at the\ndiscretion of Wells Fargo\u0092s Board of Directors. There is no guarantee that\nWells Fargo will pay dividends in the future. The timing and amount of future\ndividends, if any, will depend on earnings, cash requirements, the financial\ncondition of Wells Fargo and its subsidiaries, applicable government\nregulations and other factors deemed relevant by the Wells Fargo Board of\nDirectors.\n                                                          \n  10.

Shares are purchased and sold\nfor the Plan on specified dates or during specified periods. As a result, you\ndo not have any control over the price at which shares are purchased or sold\nfor your account, and you may pay a higher purchase price or receive a lower\nsales price than if you had purchased or sold the shares outside of the Plan.\nYou bear the risk of fluctuations in the price of Wells Fargo common stock.\nNo interest is paid on funds held by the Plan Administrator pending their\ninvestment. All optional cash investments, including the initial cash\ninvestment, are subject to collection by the Plan Administrator of the full\nface value in U.S. funds. All transactions under this Plan are subject to\ncompliance by Wells Fargo and you with all applicable legal requirements and\nall applicable regulations of any stock exchange on which Wells Fargo common\nstock may be \u0093listed.\u0094\n                                                        \n  11.  How does the Plan Administrator buy the shares?  \n                                                        \nThe Plan Administrator may purchase Wells Fargo common stock from Wells Fargo\nor use an independent agent to buy the shares in the open market or in\nnegotiated transactions. We determine the method. We currently use an\nindependent agent to buy Plan shares, but we can change this at any time\nwithout notice to you, subject to legal restrictions on how often we change\nthe method. The method used by the Plan Administrator will impact the\ndetermination of the price at which your shares are purchased (see Question\n12). 7\n                                                                       \n  12.  At what price will the Plan Administrator purchase the shares?  \n                                                                       \nOpen Market Purchases.If the shares are purchased in the open market or in a\nnegotiated transaction, your purchase price will be the weighted average\npurchase price per share for all shares purchased for that investment date.\nThe independent agent purchases shares as soon as administratively possible,\nand generally not more than five (5) business days, after the applicable\ninvestment date. Purchases from Wells Fargo.If the shares are purchased from\nWells Fargo, your purchase price will be the New York Stock Exchange-only\nclosing price of Wells Fargo common stock for that investment date. If the\nNew York Stock Exchange is closed on that date, then the price will be the\nNew York Stock Exchange-only closing price of Wells Fargo common stock for\nthe next business day the Exchange is open. The Plan Administrator may\ncommingle your funds with those of other participants for purposes of\nforwarding purchase orders to the independent agent. Also, the Plan\nAdministrator may offset purchase and sale orders for the same investment\ndate, forwarding to the independent agent the net purchase or sale\nrequirement. Because the prices at which shares are purchased under the Plan\nare beyond your control, you may lose any advantage otherwise available from\nbeing able to select the timing of your investment.\n                                                  \n  13.

What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of         \n       participating in the Plan?                                            \n                                                                             \nThe U.S. federal income tax consequences of participating in the Plan are as\nfollows:\n                                                                             \n      Cash dividends reinvested under the Plan are taxable to you as if      \n      they had been paid to you in cash on the                               \n      applicable dividend payment date. In addition, you may be treated as   \n      having received income in the amount of any brokerage commissions or   \n      other fees paid by Wells Fargo on your behalf.                         \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n      The tax basis of shares purchased with reinvested dividends or         \n      optional cash investments generally is the                             \n      amount you paid to acquire the shares, including the amount of any     \n      brokerage commissions or other fees that you pay or that are paid by   \n      Wells Fargo on your behalf. Your holding period for shares purchased   \n      under the Plan generally will begin on the                             \n      day following the date on which those shares are credited to your      \n      Plan account.                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n      You do not realize taxable income from the transfer of shares to your  \n      Plan account or from the withdrawal of                                 \n      whole shares from your Plan account. You will, however, generally      \n      realize gain or loss from the receipt of cash instead of any           \n      fractional Plan share. You will also realize gain or loss when your    \n      Plan shares are sold. The amount of the gain or loss                   \n      generally will be the difference between the amount you receive for    \n      the shares and the tax basis of the shares.                            \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n      The Plan Administrator reports dividend income to participants and     \n      the Internal Revenue Service                                           \n      (\u0093IRS\u0094) on Form 1099-DIV and may report income in the amount of any      \n      brokerage commissions or other fees paid by Wells Fargo on your        \n      behalf on Form 1099-MISC. The Plan Administrator reports the           \n      proceeds from the sale of Plan shares to the selling participants and  \n      the IRS on Form 1099-B. The Plan Administrator reports dividend        \n      income to a foreign person (nonresident alien individual or foreign    \n      entity)                                                                \n      and the IRS on Form 1042-S.                                            \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n      Dividends and sale proceeds are generally subject to federal backup    \n      withholding if you fail to certify a                                   \n      taxpayer identification number to the Plan Administrator. Any amount   \n      withheld as backup withholding tax will be allowable as a refund or    \n      credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability. Dividends       \n      payable to participants residing in certain                            \n      foreign countries may also be subject to federal withholding, as       \n      discussed below. In any case in which federal income taxes are         \n      required to be withheld, the Plan Administrator reinvests or pays to   \n      you, as the case may be, an amount equal to the                        \n      dividends or sale proceeds less the amount of tax withheld. For IRS    \n      reporting purposes, the amount of any dividend withheld is included    \n      in your dividend income.                                               \n                                                                             \nThis Plan assumes that each participant will use the first-in, first-out(\u0093\nFIFO\u0094) method when determining the tax basis of any shares sold. Participants\nmay designate their preference for a different method of determining the tax\nbasis of shares by identifying this preference in writing to the Plan\nAdministrator. Participants may designate their preference for specific\nidentification tax basis at any time. A foreign person (nonresident alien\nindividual or foreign entity) is subject to U.S. federal income tax\nwithholding at a 30% rate under Chapter 3 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986, as amended, (\u0093 IRC\u0094) on the gross amount of certain payments of U.S.\nsource income including dividends, unless the beneficial owner of the payment\ndemonstrates that it is entitled to a reduced rate of, or exemption from,\nwithholding tax under an income tax treaty by providing the relevant Form\nW-8.Accounts owned by certain foreign entities that fail to comply with\nvarious U.S. information reporting and due diligence requirements (generally\nrelating to ownership by U.S. persons of interests in or accounts with those\nentities) under Chapter 4 of the IRC, frequently referred to as \u0093FATCA,\u0094 may\nbe subject to 30% withholding on all 13\n\napplicable U.S. sourced income, including dividends. An intergovernmental\nagreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may\nmodify these requirements. Foreign persons\nshould consult with their tax advisors or counsel as to which tax\ncertification form they are required to provide and for more specific\ninformation regarding the withholding requirements under Chapters 3 and 4\n(FATCA) of the IRC.\n\nThe discussion above is only a summary of the important U.S. federal income\ntax consequences of your participation in the Plan. The summary is based on\nthe IRC, United States Treasury Regulations, administrative rulings and court\ndecisions, as in effect as of the date of this prospectus, all of which are\nsubject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary\nis not a complete description of all of the tax consequences of your\nparticipation in the Plan. For example, it does not address any state, local\nor foreign tax consequences of your participation. You should consult your\nown tax advisor about the tax consequences of your participation in the Plan.\n\n14\n\nOTHER PLAN INFORMATION\n\nStock Dividends, Stock Splits, and Distribution of Rights.
