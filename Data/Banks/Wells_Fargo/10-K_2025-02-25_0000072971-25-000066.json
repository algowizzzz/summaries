In\naddition, we offer financial\nplanning, private banking,\ninvestment management, and\nfiduciary services.

As of\nDecember 31, 2024, we had four\nreportable operating segments\nfor management reporting\npurposes: Consumer Banking and\nLending; Commercial Banking;\nCorporate and Investment\nBanking; and Wealth and\nInvestment Management. The 2024\nAnnual Report to Shareholders\nincludes financial information\nand descriptions of these\noperating segments. Human\nCapital\n\nOur people are what set Wells\nFargo apart and are critical to\nour success. Wells Fargo\ncontinues to invest in our\nemployees by offering market-\ncompetitive compensation,\ncareer-development\nopportunities, a broad array of\nbenefits, and strong work-life\nprograms. We want to be\nrecognized as a great company\nfor everyone by maintaining\nrecruitment and career\ndevelopment practices that\nsupport our employees and\nprovide an environment that\nwelcomes people from different\nbackgrounds and with different\nexperiences.\n                                                      \n  1We do not control this website. Wells Fargo has    \n  provided this link for your convenience, but does   \n  not endorse and is not responsible for the          \n  content, links, privacy policy, or security policy  \n  of this website.                                    \n                                                      \nAt December 31, 2024, we had approximately 217,000 active\nemployees, with approximately 77% of employees based in the\nUnited States. Our global workforce was 51% female and 49% male,\nand our U.S. workforce was 54% female and 46% male. Our U.S.\nworkforce was 51% white, 48% racially/ethnically diverse, and 1%\nundeclared. Compensation and benefits. Wells Fargo's\ncompensation program is linked to performance management and is\ndesigned to promote prudent risk management and reinforce its\nculture and operating standards. The compensation principles\ninclude: \u2022 Pay for performance : Compensation is linked to\ncompany, line of business, and individual performance, including\nmeeting regulatory expectations and creating long-term value\nconsistent with the interests of shareholders. \u2022 Promote\neffective risk management : Compensation promotes effective risk\nmanagement and discourages imprudent or excessive risk-taking. \u2022\nAttract and retain talent : People are one of Wells Fargo's\ncompetitive advantages; therefore, compensation helps attract,\nmotivate, and retain people with the skills, talent, and\nexperience to drive superior long-term company performance. In\naddition, we offer eligible full- and part-time employees and\ntheir eligible dependents a comprehensive set of benefits\ndesigned to support their physical, financial, and emotional\nhealth to help them make the most of their well-being. Employee\nlearning and development. We invest in the development of our\nemployees and managers. We believe that when our employees feel\nproperly supported, engaged, and confident in their skills, they\nare more effective and can provide an even better customer\nexperience. During 2024, we invested approximately $200 million\nin a variety of employee learning and development programs,\nincluding functional training, required risk and regulatory\ncompliance, leadership and professional development, and early\ntalent development programs. In addition, we provided tuition\nreimbursement for approximately 2,600 employees in 2024. Work-\nlife programs. Wells Fargo offers many benefits, programs, and\nwork arrangements intended to provide employees with flexibility\nand work-life balance. For example, employees in certain non-\ncustomer-facing roles have flexibility to work up to two days a\nweek remotely, and are expected to spend a minimum of three days\na week in the office. Expectations for other roles, including\ncustomer-facing, operations, contact center, and non-U.S. based\nemployees, vary by business need. Competition The financial\nservices industry is highly competitive. Our subsidiaries\ncompete with financial services providers such as banks, savings\nand loan associations, credit unions, finance companies,\nmortgage banking companies, insurance companies, investment\nbanks and mutual fund companies. They also face increased\ncompetition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses,\nprivate equity firms and online lending companies, as well as\nfrom financial services subsidiaries of commercial and\nmanufacturing companies. Many of these competitors enjoy fewer\nregulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures.\nSecurities firms and insurance companies that elect to become\nfinancial holding companies may acquire banks and other\nfinancial institutions. Combinations of this type could\n                               1                                \nsignificantly change the\ncompetitive environment in\nwhich we conduct business. The\nfinancial services industry is\nalso becoming more competitive\nas further technological\nadvances enable more companies\nto provide financial products\nand services, including\nelectronic and internet-based\nfinancial solutions such as\nelectronic securities trading,\nlending and payment solutions,\nas well as digital currencies\nand alternative payment\nmethods. These technological\nadvances may diminish the\nimportance of depository\ninstitutions and other\nfinancial intermediaries in the\ntransfer of funds between\nparties.\n                                                                \n   REGULATION AND SUPERVISION                                   \n                                                                \nThe U.S. financial services\nindustry is subject to\nsignificant regulation and\nregulatory oversight\ninitiatives. This regulation\nand oversight may continue to\nimpact how U.S. financial\nservices companies conduct\nbusiness and may continue to\nresult in increased regulatory\ncompliance costs.\n\nBanking statutes, regulations\nand policies are continually\nunder review by Congress and\nstate legislatures and federal\nand state regulatory agencies,\nas well as non-U.S. governments\nand financial regulators, and a\nchange in them, including\nchanges in how they are\ninterpreted or implemented,\ncould have a material effect on\nour business. The regulatory\nframework applicable to\ndepository institutions and\nbank holding companies (BHCs)\nis intended to protect\ndepositors, the federal deposit\ninsurance fund, consumers and\nthe banking system as a whole,\nand not necessarily investors\nin BHCs such as the Company.\n\nStatutes, regulations, and\npolicies could restrict our\nability to diversify into other\nareas of financial services,\nmake acquisitions, and pay\ndividends or repurchase our\ncapital stock. They may also\nrequire us to provide financial\nsupport to one or more of our\nsubsidiary banks, maintain\ncapital in excess of amounts\ndesired by management, and pay\nhigher deposit insurance\npremiums as a result of\nassessments or a general\ndeterioration in the financial\ncondition of depository\ninstitutions.\n\nThe following describes the\nmaterial elements of the\nregulatory framework applicable\nto us and the more significant\nregulations and regulatory\noversight initiatives that have\naffected or may affect our\nbusiness. For additional\ninformation about the\nregulatory matters discussed\nbelow and other regulations and\nregulatory oversight matters,\nsee the \u201cOverview,\u201d \u201cCapital\nManagement,\u201d \u201cForward-Looking\nStatements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nsections and Note 26\n(Regulatory Capital\nRequirements and Other\nRestrictions) to Financial\nStatements in the 2024 Annual\nReport to Shareholders.\n                                                                \n  General                                                       \n                                                                \nParent Bank Holding Company. As\na BHC, the Parent is subject to\nregulation under the BHC Act\nand to inspection, examination\nand supervision by its primary\nregulator, the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal\nReserve System (Federal Reserve\nBoard or FRB). The Parent is\nalso subject to the disclosure\nand regulatory requirements of\nthe Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, and the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as\namended, both as administered\nby the SEC. As a company with\nsecurities listed on the New\nYork Stock Exchange (NYSE), the\nParent is subject to the rules\nof the NYSE for listed\ncompanies.\n\nSubsidiary Banks. Our\nsubsidiary national banks, and\ntheir subsidiaries, are subject\nto regulation and examination\nprimarily by the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency\n(OCC) and also by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC), the FRB, the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau\n(CFPB), the SEC and the\nCommodities Futures Trading\nCommission (CFTC). The non-\n\nU.S. branches, subsidiaries,\nand offices of our subsidiary\nnational banks are subject to\nregulation and examination by\ntheir respective financial\nregulators as well as by the\nOCC and the FRB. Non-U.S.\noperations of our national bank\nsubsidiaries may be subject to\nthe laws and regulations of the\ncountries in which they conduct\nbusiness.\n\nNonbank Subsidiaries. Many of\nour nonbank subsidiaries are\nalso subject to regulation by\nthe FRB and other applicable\nfederal and state agencies. Our\ninsurance subsidiaries are\nsubject to regulation by\napplicable state insurance\nregulatory agencies, as well as\nthe FRB. Our brokerage\nsubsidiaries are regulated by\nthe SEC, the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority (FINRA)\nand, in some cases, the CFTC\nand the Municipal Securities\nRulemaking Board, and state\nsecurities regulators. Our\nother nonbank subsidiaries may\nbe subject to the laws and\nregulations of the federal\ngovernment and/or the various\nstates as well as non-U.S.\ncountries in which they conduct\nbusiness or operate.\n                                                                \n  Parent Bank Holding Company Activities                        \n                                                                \n\u201cFinancial in Nature\u201d\nRequirement. We became a\nfinancial holding company (FHC)\neffective March 13, 2000. We\ncontinue to maintain our status\nas a BHC for purposes of\nvarious FRB regulations. As a\nBHC that has elected to be\ntreated as an FHC pursuant to\nthe BHC Act, we may affiliate\nwith securities firms and\ninsurance companies and engage\nin other activities that are\nfinancial in nature or\nincidental or complementary to\nactivities that are financial\nin nature. \u201cFinancial in\nnature\u201d activities include\nsecurities underwriting,\ndealing, and market making;\nsponsoring mutual funds and\ninvestment companies; insurance\nunderwriting and agency;\nmerchant banking; and\nactivities that the FRB, in\nconsultation with the Secretary\nof the U.S. Treasury,\ndetermines to be financial in\nnature or incidental to such\nfinancial activity.\n\u201cComplementary activities\u201d are\nactivities that the FRB\ndetermines upon application to\nbe complementary to a financial\nactivity and do not pose a\nsafety and soundness risk.\nFinancial in nature activities\nand incidental or complementary\nactivities are collectively\nreferred to below as \u201cfinancial\nactivities\u201d.\n\nFRB approval is generally not\nrequired for us to acquire a\ncompany (other than a BHC, bank\nor savings association) engaged\nin financial activities, as\ndetermined by the FRB. Prior\nnotice to the FRB may be\nrequired, however, if the\ncompany to be acquired has\ntotal consolidated assets of\n$10 billion or more. Prior FRB\napproval is required before we\nmay acquire the beneficial\nownership or control of more\nthan 5% of the voting shares or\nsubstantially all of the assets\nof a BHC, bank or savings\nassociation. We are also\nsubject to prohibitions on our\nability to merge, acquire all\nor substantially all of the\nassets of, or acquire control\nof another company if our total\nresulting consolidated\nliabilities would exceed 10% of\nthe aggregate consolidated\nliabilities of all financial\ncompanies.\n\nBecause we are an FHC, if any\nof our applicable subsidiary\nbanks receives a rating under\nthe Community Reinvestment Act\nof 1977, as amended (CRA), of\nless than satisfactory, we will\nbe prohibited, until the rating\nis raised to satisfactory or\nbetter, from engaging in\ncertain new financial\nactivities or acquiring certain\ncompanies engaged in financial\nactivities. CRA performance is\nalso considered by regulators\nin reviewing applications to\nestablish bank branches. In\naddition, if the FRB finds that\nan FHC or any one of its\nsubsidiary banks is not well\ncapitalized or well managed,\nthe FHC would be required to\nenter into an agreement with\nthe FRB to comply with all\napplicable capital and\nmanagement requirements and\nwhich may contain additional\nlimitations or conditions.\nUntil corrected, the FHC could\nbe prohibited from engaging in\nany new financial activity or\n                               2                                \nacquiring companies engaged in\nfinancial activities without\nprior FRB approval. If the FHC\nfails to correct any such\ncondition within a prescribed\nperiod, the FRB could order the\nFHC to divest any of its\nbanking subsidiaries or, in the\nalternative, to cease engaging\nin financial activities.\n\nInterstate Banking . A BHC may\nacquire banks in states other\nthan its home state, subject to\nany state requirement that the\nbank has been organized and\noperating for a minimum period\nof time, not to exceed five\nyears, and the requirement that\nthe BHC not control, prior to\nor following the proposed\nacquisition, more than 10% of\nthe total amount of deposits of\ninsured depository institutions\nnationwide or, unless the\nacquisition is the bank holding\ncompany\u2019s initial entry into\nthe state, more than 30% of\nsuch deposits in the state (or\nsuch lesser or greater amount\nset by the state). Banks are\nalso authorized to merge across\nstate lines, subject to the\nsame deposit limits noted\nabove, thereby creating\ninterstate branches. Banks are\nalso permitted to acquire and\nto establish new branches in\nother states.\n\nRegulatory Approval. In\ndetermining whether to approve\na proposed bank acquisition,\nfederal banking regulators will\nconsider, among other factors,\nthe effect of the acquisition\non competition, financial\ncondition, and future prospects\nincluding current and projected\ncapital ratios and levels, the\ncompetence, experience, and\nintegrity of management and\nrecord of compliance with laws\nand regulations, the\nconvenience and needs of the\ncommunities to be served,\nincluding the acquiring\ninstitution\u2019s record of\ncompliance under the CRA, the\neffectiveness of the acquiring\ninstitution in combating money\nlaundering activities and the\nrisk to the stability of the\nUnited States banking system.\n                                                                \n  Holding Company Structure                                     \n                                                                \nTransfer of Funds from\nSubsidiary Banks. The Parent\u2019s\nsubsidiary banks are subject to\nrestrictions under federal law\nthat limit the transfer of\nfunds or other assets from such\nsubsidiaries to the Parent and\nits nonbank subsidiaries\n(including affiliates) in so-\ncalled \u201ccovered transactions.\u201d\nIn general, covered\ntransactions include loans and\nother extensions of credit,\ninvestments and asset\npurchases, as well as certain\nother transactions involving\nthe transfer of value from a\nsubsidiary bank to an affiliate\nor for the benefit of an\naffiliate. Unless an exemption\napplies, covered transactions\nby a subsidiary bank with a\nsingle affiliate are limited to\n10% of the subsidiary bank\u2019s\ncapital and surplus and, with\nrespect to all covered\ntransactions with affiliates in\nthe aggregate, to 20% of the\nsubsidiary bank\u2019s capital and\nsurplus. Also, loans and\nextensions of credit to\naffiliates generally must be\nsecured by qualifying\ncollateral. A bank\u2019s\ntransactions with its nonbank\naffiliates are also generally\nrequired to be on arm\u2019s length\nterms. The Parent's subsidiary\nbanks are also subject to\nlending limits and qualitative\nrequirements on loans to\nexecutive officers, directors\nand principal shareholders of\nthe Parent and its subsidiary\nbanks.\n\nSource of Strength. The FRB has\na policy that a BHC is expected\nto act as a source of financial\nand managerial strength to each\nof its subsidiary banks and,\nunder appropriate\ncircumstances, to commit\nresources to support each such\nsubsidiary bank. This support\nmay be required at times when\nthe BHC may not have the\nresources to provide the\nsupport.\n\nThe OCC may order an assessment\nof the Parent if the capital of\none of its national bank\nsubsidiaries were to become\nimpaired. If the Parent failed\nto pay the assessment within\nthree months, the OCC could\norder the sale of the Parent\u2019s\nstock in the national bank to\ncover the deficiency.\n\nDepositor Preference. In the\nevent of the \u201cliquidation or\nother resolution\u201d of an insured\ndepository institution, the\nclaims of deposits payable in\nthe United States (including\nthe claims of the FDIC as\nsubrogee of insured depositors)\nand certain claims for\nadministrative expenses of the\nFDIC as a receiver will have\npriority over other general\nunsecured claims against the\ninstitution. If an insured\ndepository institution fails,\nclaims of insured and uninsured\nU.S. depositors, along with\nclaims of the FDIC, will have\npriority in payment ahead of\nunsecured creditors, including\nthe Parent, and depositors\nwhose deposits are solely\npayable at such insured\ndepository institution\u2019s\nnon-U.S. offices.\n\nLiability of Commonly\nControlled Institutions. The\nCompany\u2019s subsidiaries include\nbanks in the U.S., such as\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A., that\nare insured by the FDIC. Under\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance\nAct (FDI Act), insured\ndepository institutions can be\nheld liable for any loss\nincurred, or reasonably\nexpected to be incurred, by the\nFDIC due to the default of an\ninsured depository institution\ncontrolled by the same BHC, and\nfor any assistance provided by\nthe FDIC to an insured\ndepository institution that is\nin danger of default and that\nis controlled by the same BHC.\n\u201cDefault\u201d means generally the\nappointment of a conservator or\nreceiver. \u201cIn danger of\ndefault\u201d means generally the\nexistence of certain conditions\nindicating that a default is\nlikely to occur in the absence\nof regulatory assistance.\n\nEnhanced supervision and\nregulation of systemically\nimportant firms . The Dodd-\nFrank Act grants broad\nauthority to federal banking\nregulators to establish\nenhanced supervisory and\nregulatory requirements for\nsystemically important firms.\nThe FRB has finalized a number\nof regulations implementing\nenhanced prudential\nrequirements for large BHCs\nlike Wells Fargo regarding\nrisk-based capital and\nleverage, risk and liquidity\nmanagement, single counterparty\ncredit limits, and imposing\ndebt-to-equity limits on any\nBHC that regulators determine\nposes a grave threat to the\nfinancial stability of the\nUnited States. The FRB and OCC\nhave also finalized rules\nimplementing stress testing\nrequirements for large BHCs and\nnational banks. Furthermore, to\npromote a BHC\u2019s safety and\nsoundness and the financial and\noperational resilience of its\noperations, the FRB has\nfinalized guidance regarding\neffective boards of directors\nof large BHCs. The OCC, under\nseparate authority, has\nfinalized guidelines\nestablishing heightened\ngovernance and risk management\nstandards for large national\nbanks such as Wells Fargo Bank,\nN.A. The OCC guidelines require\ncovered banks to establish and\nadhere to a written risk\ngovernance framework to manage\nand control their risk-taking\nactivities. The guidelines also\nformalize roles and\nresponsibilities for risk\nmanagement practices within\ncovered banks and create\ncertain risk oversight\nresponsibilities for their\nboards of directors.\n\nRegulatory Capital, Leverage\nand Liquidity Requirements\n\nThe Company and each of our\ninsured depository institutions\nare subject to various\nregulatory capital adequacy and\nliquidity requirements\nadministered by the FRB and the\nOCC. The capital rules\nimplement Basel III risk-based\ncapital requirements for U.S.\nbanking organizations and,\namong other things, establish\nrequired minimum ratios\nrelating capital to different\ncategories of assets and\nexposures. Federal banking\nregulators have also imposed a\nleverage ratio and\nsupplementary leverage ratio on\nlarge BHCs, like Wells Fargo,\nand their insured depository\ninstitutions, as well as a\nliquidity coverage ratio and a\nnet stable funding ratio. In\naddition, the Company is\nrequired to have a minimum\namount of equity and unsecured\nlong-term debt, often\n                               3                                \nreferred to as total loss\nabsorbing capacity, for\npurposes of resolvability and\nresiliency.\n\nFrom time to time, federal\nbanking regulators propose\nchanges and amendments to, and\nissue interpretations of, risk-\nbased capital requirements and\nrelated reporting instructions.\nIn addition, the FRB closely\nmonitors capital levels of the\ninstitutions it supervises and\nmay require such institutions\nto modify capital levels based\non FRB determinations. Such\ndeterminations, proposals or\ninterpretations could, if\nimplemented in the future,\naffect our reported capital\nratios and net risk-adjusted\nassets.\n\nAs an additional means to\nidentify problems in the\nfinancial management of\ndepository institutions, the\nFDI Act requires federal\nbanking regulators to establish\ncertain non-capital safety and\nsoundness standards for\ninstitutions for which they are\nthe primary federal regulator.\nThe standards relate generally\nto operations and management,\nasset quality, interest rate\nexposure, executive\ncompensation and risk\nmanagement. Federal banking\nregulators are authorized to\ntake action against\ninstitutions that fail to meet\nsuch standards.\n\nThe FDI Act requires federal\nbanking regulators to take\n\u201cprompt corrective action\u201d with\nrespect to FDIC-insured\ndepository institutions that do\nnot meet minimum capital\nrequirements. A depository\ninstitution\u2019s treatment for\npurposes of the prompt\ncorrective action provisions\nwill depend upon how its\ncapital levels compare to\nvarious capital measures and\ncertain other factors, as\nestablished by regulation.\n\nIn addition, the FRB\u2019s capital\nplan rule establishes capital\nplanning and other requirements\nthat govern capital\ndistributions, including\ndividends and share\nrepurchases, by certain BHCs,\nincluding Wells Fargo. Federal\nbanking regulators also require\nstress tests to evaluate\nwhether an institution has\nsufficient capital to continue\nto operate during periods of\nadverse economic and financial\nconditions.\n\nFor additional information on\nour capital requirements and\nplanning, as well as the\nleverage and liquidity rules\napplicable to us, see the\n\u201cCapital Management\u201d and \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Asset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Liquidity Risk and\nFunding \u2013 Liquidity Standards\u201d\nsections in the 2024 Annual\nReport to Shareholders.\n                                                                \n  \u201cLiving Will\u201d Requirements and Related Matters                \n                                                                \nLiving Will . Rules adopted by\nthe FRB and the FDIC under the\nDodd-Frank Act require large\nfinancial institutions,\nincluding Wells Fargo, to\nprepare and periodically submit\nresolution plans, also known as\n\u201cliving wills,\u201d designed to\nfacilitate their rapid and\norderly resolution in the event\nof material financial distress\nor failure. Under the rules,\nrapid and orderly resolution\nmeans a reorganization or\nliquidation of a covered\ncompany under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code that can be\naccomplished in a reasonable\nperiod of time and in a manner\nthat substantially mitigates\nthe risk that failure would\nhave serious adverse effects on\nthe financial stability of the\nUnited States. In addition to\nthe Company\u2019s resolution plan,\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the\n\u201cBank\u201d) is also required to\nprepare and periodically submit\na resolution plan. If the FRB\nand FDIC determine that our\nresolution plan has\ndeficiencies, they may impose\nmore stringent capital,\nleverage or liquidity\nrequirements on us or restrict\nour growth, activities or\noperations until we adequately\nremedy the deficiencies. If the\nFRB and FDIC ultimately\ndetermine that we have been\nunable to remedy any\ndeficiencies, they could\nrequire us to divest certain\nassets or operations. On June\n21, 2024, the FRB and FDIC\nannounced that the Company\u2019s\nmost recent resolution plan did\nnot have any shortcomings or\ndeficiencies.\n\nIf Wells Fargo were to fail, it\nmay be resolved in a bankruptcy\nproceeding or, if certain\nconditions are met, under the\nresolution regime created by\nthe Dodd-Frank Act known as the\n\u201corderly liquidation\nauthority.\u201d The orderly\nliquidation authority allows\nfor the appointment of the FDIC\nas receiver for a systemically\nimportant financial institution\nthat is in default or in danger\nof default if, among other\nthings, the resolution of the\ninstitution under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code would have\nserious adverse effects on\nfinancial stability in the\nUnited States. If the FDIC is\nappointed as receiver for the\nParent, then the orderly\nliquidation authority, rather\nthan the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,\nwould determine the powers of\nthe receiver and the rights and\nobligations of our security\nholders. The FDIC\u2019s orderly\nliquidation authority requires\nthat security holders of a\ncompany in receivership bear\nall losses before U.S.\ntaxpayers are exposed to any\nlosses. There are substantial\ndifferences in the rights of\ncreditors between the orderly\nliquidation authority and the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code, including\nthe right of the FDIC to\ndisregard the strict priority\nof creditor claims under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain\ncircumstances and the use of an\nadministrative claims procedure\ninstead of a judicial procedure\nto determine creditors\u2019 claims.\n\nThe strategy described in our\nmost recent resolution plan is\na single point of entry\nstrategy, in which the Parent\nwould be the only material\nlegal entity to enter\nresolution proceedings.\nHowever, the strategy described\nin our resolution plan is not\nbinding in the event of an\nactual resolution of Wells\nFargo, whether conducted under\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by\nthe FDIC under the orderly\nliquidation authority. The FDIC\nhas announced that a single\npoint of entry strategy may be\na desirable strategy under its\nimplementation of the orderly\nliquidation authority, but not\nall aspects of how the FDIC\nmight exercise this authority\nare known and additional\nrulemaking is possible.\n\nTo facilitate the orderly\nresolution of systemically\nimportant financial\ninstitutions in case of\nmaterial distress or failure,\nfederal banking regulations\nrequire that institutions, such\nas Wells Fargo, maintain a\nminimum amount of equity and\nunsecured debt to absorb losses\nand recapitalize operating\nsubsidiaries. Federal banking\nregulators have also required\nmeasures to facilitate the\ncontinued operation of\noperating subsidiaries\nnotwithstanding the failure of\ntheir parent companies, such as\nlimitations on parent\nguarantees, and have issued\nguidance encouraging\ninstitutions to take legally\nbinding measures to provide\ncapital and liquidity resources\nto certain subsidiaries to\nfacilitate an orderly\nresolution.\n\nSupport Agreement . In response\nto the regulators\u2019 guidance and\nto facilitate the orderly\nresolution of the Company, on\nJune 28, 2017, the Parent\nentered into a support\nagreement, as amended and\nrestated on June 26, 2019 (the\n\u201cSupport Agreement\u201d), with WFC\nHoldings, LLC, an intermediate\nholding company and subsidiary\nof the Parent (the \u201cIHC\u201d), the\nBank, Wells Fargo Securities,\nLLC (WFS), Wells Fargo Clearing\nServices, LLC (WFCS), and\ncertain other subsidiaries of\nthe Parent designated from time\nto time as material entities\nfor resolution planning\npurposes (the \u201cCovered\nEntities\u201d) or identified from\ntime to time as related support\nentities in our resolution plan\n(the \u201cRelated Support\nEntities\u201d). Pursuant to the\nSupport Agreement, the Parent\ntransferred a significant\namount of its assets, including\nthe majority of its cash,\ndeposits, liquid securities and\nintercompany loans (but\nexcluding its equity interests\nin its subsidiaries and certain\nother assets), to the IHC and\nwill continue to transfer those\ntypes of assets to the IHC from\ntime to time. In the event of\nour material financial distress\nor failure,\n                               4                                \nthe IHC will be obligated to\nuse the transferred assets to\nprovide capital and/or\nliquidity to the Bank, WFS,\nWFCS, and the Covered Entities\npursuant to the Support\nAgreement. Under the Support\nAgreement, the IHC will also\nprovide funding and liquidity\nto the Parent through\nsubordinated notes and a\ncommitted line of credit,\nwhich, together with the\nissuance of dividends, is\nexpected to provide the Parent,\nduring business as usual\noperating conditions, with the\nsame access to cash necessary\nto service its debts, pay\ndividends, repurchase its\nshares, and perform its other\nobligations as it would have\nhad if it had not entered into\nthese arrangements and\ntransferred any assets. If\ncertain liquidity and/or\ncapital metrics fall below\ndefined triggers, or if the\nParent\u2019s board of directors\nauthorizes it to file a case\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,\nthe subordinated notes would be\nforgiven, the committed line of\ncredit would terminate, and the\nIHC\u2019s ability to pay dividends\nto the Parent would be\nrestricted, any of which could\nmaterially and adversely impact\nthe Parent\u2019s liquidity and its\nability to satisfy its debts\nand other obligations, and\ncould result in the\ncommencement of bankruptcy\nproceedings by the Parent at an\nearlier time than might have\notherwise occurred if the\nSupport Agreement were not\nimplemented. The respective\nobligations under the Support\nAgreement of the Parent, the\nIHC, the Bank, and the Related\nSupport Entities are secured\npursuant to a related security\nagreement.\n\nRecovery Plan . In addition to\nour resolution plans, we must\nalso prepare and periodically\nsubmit to the FRB a recovery\nplan that identifies a range of\noptions that we may consider\nduring times of idiosyncratic\nor systemic economic stress to\nremedy any financial weaknesses\nand restore market confidence\nwithout extraordinary\ngovernment support. Recovery\noptions include the possible\nsale, transfer or disposal of\nassets, securities, loan\nportfolios or businesses. The\nBank must also prepare and\nperiodically submit to the OCC\na recovery plan that sets forth\nthe Bank\u2019s plan to remain a\ngoing concern when the Bank is\nexperiencing considerable\nfinancial or operational\nstress, but has not yet\ndeteriorated to the point where\nliquidation or resolution is\nimminent. If either the FRB or\nthe OCC determines that our\nrecovery plan is deficient,\nthey may impose fines,\nrestrictions on our business or\nultimately require us to divest\nassets.\n                                                                \n  Dividend and Share Repurchase Restrictions                    \n                                                                \nThe Parent is a legal entity\nseparate and distinct from its\nsubsidiary banks and other\nsubsidiaries. A significant\nsource of funds to pay\ndividends on our common and\npreferred stock and principal\nand interest on our debt is\ndividends from the Parent\u2019s\nsubsidiaries. Various federal\nand state statutory provisions\nand regulations limit the\namount of dividends the\nParent\u2019s subsidiary banks and\ncertain other subsidiaries may\npay without regulatory\napproval. Federal banking\nregulators have the authority\nto prohibit the Parent\u2019s\nsubsidiary banks from engaging\nin unsafe or unsound practices\nin conducting their businesses.\nThe payment of dividends,\ndepending on the financial\ncondition of the bank in\nquestion, could be deemed an\nunsafe or unsound practice.\nSimilarly, as part of their\nsupervisory authority,\nregulators may limit or\nrestrict subsidiary capital\ndistributions. The ability of\nthe Parent\u2019s subsidiary banks\nto pay dividends in the future\nis currently, and could be\nfurther, influenced by bank\nregulatory policies and capital\nrequirements. For information\nabout the restrictions\napplicable to the Parent\u2019s\nsubsidiary banks, see\n\nNote 26 (Regulatory Capital\nRequirements and Other\nRestrictions) to Financial\nStatements in the 2024 Annual\nReport to Shareholders.\n\nFurthermore, under the Support\nAgreement, the IHC may be\nrestricted from making dividend\npayments to the Parent if\ncertain liquidity and/or\ncapital metrics fall below\ndefined triggers, or if the\nParent\u2019s board of directors\nauthorizes it to file a case\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nAny such restriction could\nmaterially and adversely impact\nthe Parent\u2019s liquidity and its\nability to satisfy its debt and\nother obligations, as well as\nits ability to make dividend\npayments on its common and\npreferred stock. See the \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d section of the 2024\nAnnual Report to Shareholders\nfor additional information on\nthe Support Agreement.\n\nIn addition to these\nrestrictions on the ability of\nour subsidiary banks to pay\ndividends to us, the FRB\nrequires large BHCs, including\nWells Fargo, to submit annual\ncapital plans describing\nplanned capital distributions,\nsuch as the payment of\ndividends and share\nrepurchases. Large BHCs, like\nWells Fargo, and their insured\ndepository institutions also\nmust comply with various\ncapital requirements, including\nthe reforms known as Basel III,\nas well as rules that establish\nleverage and supplementary\nleverage ratio requirements. We\nare also subject to the FRB's\nrule implementing an additional\ncapital surcharge on those U.S.\nbanking organizations, such as\nthe Company, that are\ndesignated as global\nsystemically important banks\n(G-SIBs). The failure to meet\nany of these requirements could\nresult in limitations or\nrestrictions on our ability to\nmake capital distributions.\n\nIn addition, the FRB\u2019s enhanced\nsupervision regulations for\nlarge BHCs, like Wells Fargo,\nimpose capital distribution\nrestrictions, including on the\npayment of dividends, upon the\noccurrence of capital, stress\ntest, risk management, or\nliquidity risk management\ntriggers. For additional\ninformation on regulations or\narrangements that may impose\ncapital distribution\nrestrictions on the Company and\nits subsidiaries, see the\n\u201cCapital Management\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d sections of the 2024\nAnnual Report to Shareholders.\n                                                                \n  Deposit Insurance Assessments                                 \n                                                                \nThe Company\u2019s subsidiaries\ninclude banks, such as Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A., that are\ninsured by the FDIC. Through\nthe Deposit Insurance Fund\n(DIF) maintained by the FDIC,\nthe FDIC insures the deposits\nof our insured banks up to\nprescribed limits for each\ndepositor and funds the DIF\nthrough assessments on member\nbanks. To maintain the DIF,\nmember institutions are\nassessed an insurance premium\nbased on an assessment base and\nan assessment rate.\n\nThe FDIC has adopted a\ncomprehensive, long-range plan\nfor DIF management, targeting a\ndesignated reserve ratio of 2%.\nIn addition, the FDIC may\nrecover by special assessment\non member banks losses to the\nDIF as a result of resolving a\nfailed bank. For additional\ninformation about our FDIC\ndeposit assessment expense, see\nNote 21 (Revenue and Expenses)\nto Financial Statements in the\n2024 Annual Report to\nShareholders.\n\nThe FDIC may terminate a\ndepository institution\u2019s\ndeposit insurance upon a\nfinding that the institution\u2019s\nfinancial condition is unsafe\nor unsound or that the\ninstitution or its directors\nhave engaged in unsafe or\nunsound practices or have\nviolated any applicable law,\nregulation, order or condition\nenacted or imposed by the\ninstitution\u2019s regulatory\nagency. The termination of\ndeposit insurance for one or\nmore of our bank subsidiaries\ncould result in a significant\nloss of deposits and have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our\nliquidity and earnings,\ndepending on the collective\nsize of the particular banks\ninvolved.\n                               5                                \n                                                                \n  Fiscal and Monetary Policies                                  \n                                                                \nOur business and earnings are\naffected significantly by the\nfiscal and monetary policies of\nthe federal government and its\nagencies. We are particularly\naffected by the monetary\npolicies of the FRB, which\nregulates the supply of money\nand credit in the United\nStates. Among the instruments\nof monetary policy available to\nthe FRB are (a) conducting open\nmarket operations in United\nStates government securities,\n(b) changing the discount rates\nof borrowings of depository\ninstitutions, (c) imposing or\nchanging reserve requirements\nagainst depository\ninstitutions\u2019 deposits, and (d)\nimposing or changing reserve\nrequirements against certain\nborrowings by banks and their\naffiliates. These methods are\nused in varying degrees and\ncombinations to directly affect\nthe availability of bank loans\nand deposits, as well as the\ninterest rates charged on loans\nand paid on deposits. The\npolicies of the FRB may have a\nmaterial effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations\nand financial condition.\n\nPrivacy Provisions and the\nSharing of Personal Financial\nData\n\nFederal banking regulators, as\nrequired under the Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act (GLB Act), have\nadopted rules limiting the\nability of banks and other\nfinancial institutions to\ndisclose nonpublic information\nabout consumers to\nnonaffiliated third parties.\nThe rules require disclosure of\nprivacy policies to consumers\nand, in some circumstances,\nallow consumers to prevent\ndisclosure of certain personal\ninformation to nonaffiliated\nthird parties. The privacy\nprovisions of the GLB Act\naffect how consumer information\nis transmitted through\ndiversified financial services\ncompanies and conveyed to\noutside vendors. The Fair\nCredit Reporting Act imposes\nrequirements regarding sharing\ncertain information about\nconsumers among affiliated\ncompanies. Under these\nrequirements, consumers have\nthe option to opt out from\naffiliated companies sharing\ncertain information among the\naffiliates, depending on the\ninformation and purpose of\nsharing.\n\nPersonal Financial Data Rights.\nIn October 2024, the CFPB\nissued a rule pursuant to\nsection 1033 of the Dodd-Frank\nAct that requires financial\nservice providers to make\nconsumers\u2019 data available upon\nrequest to consumers and\nauthorized third parties. The\ncompliance date for the rule is\nApril 1, 2026. The rule will\nrequire the Company to update\nits technology systems,\ncompliance, third-party risk\nmanagement programs, and\ndigital channels. Given the\nrule\u2019s requirement to share\ncustomer information with\nauthorized third parties, some\nof whom could be non-financial\ninstitutions, the rule could\nresult in increased fraud, data\nmisuse, and competition.\n                                                                \n  Regulation of Consumer Financial Products                     \n                                                                \nConsumer financial products are\nsubject to numerous and, in\nmany cases, highly complex\nfederal and state consumer\nprotection laws and\nregulations, as well as\nenhanced regulatory scrutiny\nand expectations. In\nparticular, the CFPB implements\nand enforces regulations\ndesigned to ensure that\nconsumers receive timely,\nclear, and accurate disclosures\nregarding financial products\nand are protected from unfair,\ndeceptive or abusive practices.\nThe CFPB has issued and\nproposed a number of rules\nimpacting consumer financial\nproducts, including rules\nimpacting residential mortgage\nlending, credit cards, and\nother financial products and\nbanking related activities, as\nwell as the fees that may be\ncharged for certain banking\nproducts and services. In\naddition to these rulemaking\nactivities, the CFPB may\nconduct ongoing supervisory\nexamination activities of the\nfinancial services industry\nwith respect to a number of\nconsumer businesses and\nproducts, including mortgage\nlending and servicing, fair\nlending requirements, and auto\nfinance.\n\nRegulation of Swaps and Other\nDerivatives Activities\n\nThe CFTC and the SEC have\nadopted comprehensive sets of\nrules regulating swaps and\nsecurity-based swaps,\nrespectively, and the OCC and\nother federal regulatory\nagencies have adopted margin\nrequirements for uncleared\nswaps and security-based swaps.\nAs a registered swap dealer and\na conditionally-registered\nsecurity-based swap dealer,\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A., is\nsubject to these rules.\n\nRegulatory Developments Related\nto Climate Change and\nSustainability\n\nFederal, state, and non-U.S.\ngovernments and government\nagencies have demonstrated\nincreased attention to the\nimpacts and potential risks\nassociated with climate change\nand sustainability-related\nactivities. For example,\nfederal banking regulators are\nreviewing the implications of\nclimate change on the financial\nstability of the United States\nand have issued guidance on the\nidentification and management\nby large banks of climate-\nrelated financial risks. In\naddition, the SEC adopted final\nrules, which have been\nvoluntarily stayed pending\nlegal proceedings, requiring\npublic companies to disclose\ncertain climate-related\ninformation, including climate-\nrelated risks and impacts,\ncertain greenhouse gas\nemissions, climate-related\ntargets and goals, and\ngovernance of climate-related\nrisks and relevant risk\nmanagement processes.\nSimilarly, California finalized\nclimate-related disclosure\nlaws, while multiple other\nstates have proposed or adopted\nlaws and guidance with\nrequirements for, or\nrestrictions on,\nsustainability-related\ninitiatives or disclosures.\nAdditionally, the European\nUnion finalized its Corporate\nSustainability Reporting\nDirective (CSRD) requiring\ncompanies to assess climate\nrisks, opportunities, and\nimpacts as well as disclose\ncertain climate-related\ninformation, and also finalized\nits Corporate Sustainability\nDue Diligence Directive (CSDDD)\nrequiring companies to adopt\nand implement a transition plan\nfor climate change mitigation.\nThe approaches taken by various\ngovernments and government\nagencies can vary\nsignificantly, evolve over\ntime, and sometimes conflict.\nAny current or future rules,\nregulations, and guidance\nrelated to climate change and\nits impacts could require us to\nchange certain of our business\npractices or strategies, reduce\nour revenue and earnings,\nimpose additional costs on us,\nsubject us to legal or\nregulatory proceedings, or\notherwise adversely affect our\nbusiness operations and/or\ncompetitive position.\n                                                                \n  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002                                    \n                                                                \nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\n(Sarbanes-Oxley) implemented a\nbroad range of corporate\ngovernance and accounting\nmeasures designed to increase\ncorporate responsibility,\nprovide for enhanced penalties\nfor accounting and auditing\nimproprieties at publicly\ntraded companies, and protect\ninvestors by improving the\naccuracy and reliability of\ndisclosures under federal\nsecurities laws. We are subject\nto Sarbanes-Oxley because we\nare required to file periodic\nreports with the SEC under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of\n1934. Among other things,\nSarbanes-Oxley and/or its\nimplementing regulations\nestablished membership\nrequirements and additional\nresponsibilities for our audit\ncommittee, imposed restrictions\non the relationship between us\nand our outside auditors\n(including restrictions on the\ntypes of non-audit services our\nauditors may provide to us),\nimposed additional\nresponsibilities for our\nexternal financial statements\non our chief executive officer\nand chief financial officer,\nexpanded the disclosure\nrequirements for our corporate\ninsiders, required our\nmanagement to evaluate our\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures and our internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting, and\n                               6                                \nrequired our independent\nregistered public accounting\nfirm to issue a report on our\ninternal control over financial\nreporting. USA PATRIOT Act The\nUniting and Strengthening\nAmerica by Providing\nAppropriate Tools Required to\nIntercept and Obstruct\nTerrorism Act of 2001 (USA\nPATRIOT Act) is intended to\nstrengthen the ability of U.S.\nlaw enforcement agencies and\nintelligence communities to\nwork together to combat\nterrorism on a variety of\nfronts. The USA PATRIOT Act has\nsignificant implications for\ndepository institutions,\nbrokers, dealers and other\nbusinesses involved in the\ntransfer of money. The USA\nPATRIOT Act requires the\nimplementation of policies and\nprocedures relating to anti-\nmoney laundering, economic\nsanctions, suspicious\nactivities, and currency\ntransaction reporting and due\ndiligence on customers. The USA\nPATRIOT Act also requires\nfederal banking regulators to\nevaluate the effectiveness of\nan applicant in combating money\nlaundering in determining\nwhether to approve a proposed\nbank acquisition. Other\nRegulatory Related Matters The\nCompany is subject to a number\nof consent orders and other\nregulatory actions, which may\nrequire the Company, among\nother things, to undertake\ncertain changes to its\nbusiness, operations, products\nand services, and risk\nmanagement practices. For a\ndiscussion of certain consent\norders and other regulatory\nactions applicable to the\nCompany, see the \u201cOverview\u201d\nsection in the 2024 Annual\nReport to Shareholders. Future\nLegislation or Regulation\nEconomic, market and political\nconditions during the past\nseveral years have led to a\nsignificant amount of\nlegislation and regulation in\nthe U.S. and abroad affecting\nthe financial services\nindustry, as well as heightened\nexpectations and scrutiny of\nfinancial services companies\nfrom banking regulators.\nFurther legislative changes and\nadditional regulations may\nchange our operating\nenvironment in substantial and\nunpredictable ways. Such\nlegislation and regulations\ncould increase our cost of\ndoing business, affect our\ncompensation structure,\nrestrict or expand the\nactivities in which we may\nengage or affect the\ncompetitive balance among\nbanks, savings associations,\ncredit unions, and other\nfinancial institutions. We\ncannot predict whether future\nlegislative proposals will be\nenacted and, if enacted, the\neffect that they, or any\nimplementing regulations, would\nhave on our business, results\nof operations or financial\ncondition.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nAdditional information in\nresponse to this Item 1 can be\nfound in the 2024 Annual Report\nto Shareholders under\n\u201cFinancial Review\u201d and under\n\u201cFinancial Statements.\u201d That\ninformation is incorporated\ninto this item by reference.\n                            \n  ITEM 1A.

Under the\nDeferred Compensation Plan,\neligible employees may defer\nreceipt of salary, bonuses and\ncertain other compensation\nsubject to the terms of the\nplan. Deferral elections are\nirrevocable once made except\nfor limited re-deferral\nopportunities. We treat amounts\ndeferred by a participant as if\ninvested in the earnings\noptions selected by the\nparticipant and determine the\ndeferred compensation benefit\npayable to the participant\nbased on the performance of\nthose earnings options. The\nplan offers a number of\nearnings options, including one\nbased on our common stock with\ndividends reinvested. We\ngenerally distribute amounts\nallocated to the common stock\noption in shares of common\nstock. Participants have no\ndirect interest in any of the\nearnings options and are\ngeneral unsecured creditors of\nthe Company with respect to\ntheir deferred compensation\nbenefits under the plan. Non-\nQualified Deferred Compensation\nPlan for Independent\nContractors . Under the Non-\nQualified Deferred Compensation\nPlan for Independent\nContractors participants who\nperformed qualifying investment\nor other financial services for\nparticipating affiliates as\nindependent contractors were\nable to defer all or part of\ntheir eligible compensation\npayable to them by the\naffiliate subject to the terms\nof the plan. Deferral elections\nwere irrevocable once made.\nAmounts deferred by a\nparticipant were treated as if\ninvested in the earnings\noptions selected by the\nparticipant, which determine\nthe deferred compensation\nbenefit payable to the\nparticipant. The plan offered a\nnumber of earnings options,\nincluding one based on our\ncommon stock with dividends\nreinvested. We generally\ndistribute amounts allocated to\nthe common stock option in\nshares of common stock. No\nfuture deferrals may be made\nunder this plan and\nparticipants may no longer\nreallocate their existing\naccount balances under the plan\namong different investment\noptions. Shares remaining\navailable for issuance under\nthe plan consist of shares\nissuable as a result of amounts\ncredited to participant\naccounts denominated in our\ncommon stock to reflect cash\ndividends paid on the common\nstock. The plan is sponsored by\na wholly owned subsidiary, WF\nDeferred Compensation Holdings,\nInc. We have guaranteed its\nobligations under the plan.\nParticipants have no direct\ninterest in any of the earnings\noptions and are general\nunsecured creditors of the plan\nsponsor and the Company with\nrespect to their deferred\ncompensation benefits under the\nplan. Norwest Corporation\nDirectors\u2019 Formula Stock Award\nPlan . Under the Norwest\nCorporation Directors\u2019 Formula\nStock Award Plan we awarded\nshares of common stock to non-\nemployee directors. The plan\nallowed participants to defer\nreceipt of all or a portion of\ntheir awards, with dividends\nreinvested, until a future year\nor years as selected by the\nparticipants subject to the\nterms of the plan. Participants\ncan elect one time to defer\ncommencement of distribution of\ntheir deferral accounts if the\nelection is made sufficiently\nin advance of the original\ndistribution commencement date\nand the new distribution\ncommencement date is\nsufficiently beyond the\noriginal distribution\ncommencement date. Participants\nhave no direct interest in the\nshares deferred under the plan\nand are general unsecured\ncreditors of the Company with\nrespect to payment of their\ndeferred stock awards under the\nplan. No future stock awards or\ndeferrals may be made under\nthis plan.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nAdditional information with\nrespect to security ownership\nof certain beneficial owners of\nour common stock and the\nsecurity ownership of our\nmanagement in response to this\nItem 12 will be in the\nCompany\u2019s 2025 Proxy Statement\nand is incorporated into this\nitem by reference.\n                                                                \n  ITEM 13.
