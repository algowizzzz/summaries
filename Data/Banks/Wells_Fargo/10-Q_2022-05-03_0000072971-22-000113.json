useful\nfinancial measure because it enables investors\nand others to assess the Company\u2019s ability to\ngenerate capital to cover credit losses\nthrough a credit cycle.\n\n(2) Book value per common share is common\nstockholders\u2019 equity divided by common shares\noutstanding. Tangible book value per common\nshare is tangible common equity divided by\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\n(3) Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure and represents total equity\nless preferred equity, noncontrolling\ninterests, goodwill, certain identifiable\nintangible assets (other than mortgage\nservicing rights) and goodwill and other\nintangibles on investments in consolidated\nportfolio companies, net of applicable\ndeferred taxes. The methodology of determining\ntangible common equity may differ among\ncompanies. Management believes that return on\naverage tangible common equity and tangible\nbook value per common share, which utilize\ntangible common equity, are useful financial\nmeasures because they enable management,\ninvestors, and others to assess the Company\u2019s\nuse of equity.

Addressing\nthese regulatory\nactions is expected to\ntake multiple years,\nand we are likely to\nexperience issues or\ndelays along the way\nin satisfying their\nrequirements. Issues\nor delays with one\nregulatory action\ncould affect our\nprogress on others,\nand failure to satisfy\nthe requirements of a\nregulatory action on a\ntimely basis could\nresult in additional\npenalties, enforcement\nactions, and other\nnegative consequences,\nwhich could be\nsignificant. While we\nstill have significant\nwork to do, the\nCompany is committed\nto devoting the\nresources necessary to\noperate with strong\nbusiness practices and\ncontrols, maintain the\nhighest level of\nintegrity, and have an\nappropriate culture in\nplace.\n\nFederal Reserve Board\nConsent Order\nRegarding Governance\nOversight and\nCompliance and\nOperational Risk\nManagement\n\nOn February 2, 2018,\nthe Company entered\ninto a consent order\nwith the Board of\nGovernors of the\nFederal Reserve System\n(FRB). As required by\nthe consent order, the\nCompany\u2019s Board of\nDirectors (Board)\nsubmitted to the FRB a\nplan to further\nenhance the Board\u2019s\ngovernance and\noversight of the\nCompany, and the\nCompany submitted to\nthe FRB a plan to\nfurther improve the\nCompany\u2019s compliance\nand operational risk\nmanagement program.\nThe Company continues\nto engage with the FRB\nas the Company works\nto address the consent\norder provisions. The\nconsent order also\nrequires the Company,\nfollowing the FRB\u2019s\nacceptance and\napproval of the plans\nand the Company\u2019s\nadoption and\nimplementation of the\nplans, to complete an\ninitial third-party\nreview of the\nenhancements and\nimprovements provided\nfor in the plans.\nUntil this third-party\nreview is complete\n\nand the plans are\napproved and\nimplemented to the\nsatisfaction of the\nFRB, the Company\u2019s\ntotal consolidated\nassets as defined\nunder the consent\norder will be limited\nto the level as of\nDecember 31, 2017.\nCompliance with this\nasset cap is measured\non a two-quarter daily\naverage basis to allow\nfor management of\ntemporary\nfluctuations. After\nremoval of the asset\ncap, a second third-\nparty review must also\nbe conducted to assess\nthe efficacy and\nsustainability of the\nenhancements and\nimprovements.\n\nConsent Orders with\nthe Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau and\nOffice of the\nComptroller of the\nCurrency Regarding\nCompliance Risk\nManagement Program,\nAutomobile Collateral\nProtection Insurance\nPolicies, and Mortgage\nInterest Rate Lock\nExtensions\n\nOn April 20, 2018, the\nCompany entered into\nconsent orders with\nthe Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau\n(CFPB) and the Office\nof the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (OCC) to\npay an aggregate of $1\nbillion in civil money\npenalties to resolve\nmatters regarding the\nCompany\u2019s compliance\nrisk management\nprogram and past\npractices involving\ncertain automobile\ncollateral protection\ninsurance (CPI)\npolicies and certain\nmortgage interest rate\nlock extensions. As\nrequired by the\nconsent orders, the\nCompany submitted to\nthe CFPB and OCC an\nenterprise-wide\ncompliance risk\nmanagement plan and a\nplan to enhance the\nCompany\u2019s internal\naudit program with\nrespect to federal\nconsumer financial law\nand the terms of the\nconsent orders. In\naddition, as required\nby the consent orders,\nthe Company submitted\nfor non-objection\nplans to remediate\ncustomers affected by\nthe automobile\ncollateral protection\ninsurance and mortgage\ninterest rate lock\nmatters, as well as a\nplan for the\nmanagement of\nremediation activities\nconducted by the\nCompany. The Company\ncontinues to work to\naddress the provisions\nof the consent orders.\nThe Company has not\nyet satisfied certain\naspects of the consent\norders, and as a\nresult, we believe\nregulators may impose\nadditional penalties\nor take other\nenforcement actions.\nOn September 9, 2021,\nthe OCC assessed a\n$250 million civil\nmoney penalty against\nthe Company related to\ninsufficient progress\nin addressing\nrequirements under the\nOCC\u2019s April 2018\nconsent order and loss\nmitigation activities\nin the Company\u2019s Home\nLending business.\n\nConsent Order with the\nOCC Regarding Loss\nMitigation Activities\n\nOn September 9, 2021,\nthe Company entered\ninto a consent order\nwith the OCC requiring\nthe Company to improve\nthe execution, risk\nmanagement, and\noversight of loss\nmitigation activities\nin its Home Lending\nbusiness. In addition,\nthe consent order\nrestricts the Company\nfrom acquiring certain\nthird-party\n                              \n  Wells Fargo & Company    3  \n                              \n                                              \n  Overview(continued)                         \n                                              \nresidential mortgage\nservicing and limits\ntransfers of certain\nmortgage loans\nrequiring customer\nremediation out of the\nCompany\u2019s mortgage\nservicing portfolio\nuntil remediation is\nprovided.\n\nRetail Sales Practices\nMatters and Other\nCustomer Remediation\nActivities\n\nIn September 2016, we\nannounced settlements\nwith the CFPB, the\nOCC, and the Office of\nthe Los Angeles City\nAttorney, and entered\ninto related consent\norders with the CFPB\nand the OCC, in\nconnection with\nallegations that some\nof our retail\ncustomers received\nproducts and services\nthey did not request.\nAs a result, it\nremains a priority to\nrebuild trust through\na comprehensive action\nplan that includes\nmaking things right\nfor our customers,\nemployees, and other\nstakeholders, and\nbuilding a better\nCompany for the\nfuture. On September\n8, 2021, the CFPB\nconsent order\nregarding retail sales\npractices expired.\n\nOur priority of\nrebuilding trust has\nalso included an\neffort to identify\nother areas or\ninstances where\ncustomers may have\nexperienced financial\nharm, provide\nremediation as\nappropriate, and\nimplement additional\noperational and\ncontrol procedures. We\nare working with our\nregulatory agencies in\nthis effort. We have\npreviously disclosed\nkey areas of focus as\npart of our rebuilding\ntrust efforts and are\nin the process of\nproviding remediation\nfor those matters. We\nhave accrued for the\nprobable and estimable\nremediation costs\nrelated to our\nrebuilding trust\nefforts, which amounts\nmay change based on\nadditional facts and\ninformation, as well\nas ongoing reviews and\ncommunications with\nour regulators. As our\nongoing reviews\ncontinue and as we\ncontinue to strengthen\nour risk and control\ninfrastructure, we\nhave identified and\nmay in the future\nidentify additional\nitems or areas of\npotential concern. To\nthe extent issues are\nidentified, we will\ncontinue to assess any\ncustomer harm and\nprovide remediation as\nappropriate.\n\nFor additional\ninformation regarding\nretail sales practices\nmatters and other\ncustomer remediation\nactivities, including\nrelated legal and\nregulatory risk, see\nthe \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nsection in our 2021\nForm 10-K and Note 13\n(Legal Actions) to\nFinancial Statements\nin this Report.\n                                              \n  Recent Developments                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  LIBOR Transition                            \n                                              \nThe London Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR)\nis a widely referenced\nbenchmark rate that\nseeks to estimate the\ncost at which banks\ncan borrow on an\nunsecured basis from\nother banks. On March\n5, 2021, the United\nKingdom\u2019s Financial\nConduct Authority and\nICE Benchmark\nAdministration, the\nadministrator of\nLIBOR, announced that\ncertain settings of\nLIBOR would no longer\nbe published on a\nrepresentative basis\nafter December 31,\n2021, and the most\ncommonly used U.S.\ndollar (USD) LIBOR\nsettings would no\nlonger be published on\na representative basis\nafter June 30, 2023.\nCentral banks in\nvarious jurisdictions\nconvened committees to\nidentify replacement\nrates to facilitate\nthe transition away\nfrom LIBOR. The\ncommittee convened by\nthe Federal Reserve in\nthe United States, the\nAlternative Reference\nRates Committee\n(ARRC), recommended\nthe Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (SOFR)\nas the replacement\nrate for USD LIBOR.\nAdditionally, the\nFederal Reserve, the\nOCC and the Federal\nDeposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC)\nhave issued guidance\nstrongly encouraging\nbanking organizations\nto cease using USD\nLIBOR as a reference\nrate in new contracts.\n\nIn preparation for the\ncessation of the\nvarious LIBOR\nsettings, we have\nundertaken a variety\nof activities. Among\nother things, we\nproactively\nimplemented internal\n\u201cstop-sell\u201d dates to\ndiscontinue offering\nproducts referencing\nLIBOR except pursuant\nto limited exceptions\nconsistent with\nregulatory guidance.\nAt the same time, we\nexpanded our suite of\nproduct offerings that\nare indexed to\nalternative reference\nrates.\n\nWe also continue to\ntransition our legacy\nLIBOR contracts to\nalternative reference\nrates. We transitioned\nsubstantially all of\nour legacy contracts\nwith LIBOR settings\nimpacted by the\nDecember 31, 2021,\ncessation date to\nalternative reference\nrates, and we will\ncontinue to address\ncontracts with LIBOR\nsettings that are\nimpacted by the June\n30, 2023, cessation\ndate.\n\nIn first quarter 2022,\nthe Adjustable\nInterest Rate Act (the\nLIBOR Act) was enacted\nto provide a statutory\nframework to replace\nLIBOR with a benchmark\nrate based on SOFR in\ncontracts that do not\nhave fallback\nprovisions or that\nhave fallback\nprovisions resulting\nin a replacement rate\nbased on LIBOR.

We define our\nreportable operating\nsegments by type of\nproduct and customer\nsegment, and their\nresults are based on\nour management\nreporting process. The\nmanagement reporting\nprocess measures the\nperformance of the\nreportable operating\nsegments based on the\nCompany\u2019s management\nstructure, and the\nresults are regularly\nreviewed by our Chief\nExecutive Officer and\nOperating Committee.\nThe management\nreporting process is\nbased on U.S. GAAP and\nincludes specific\nadjustments, such as\nfunds transfer pricing\nfor asset/liability\nmanagement, shared\nrevenues and expenses,\nand taxable-equivalent\nadjustments to\nconsistently reflect\nincome from taxable\nand tax-exempt\nsources, which allows\nmanagement to assess\nperformance\nconsistently across\nthe operating\nsegments.\n\nFunds Transfer Pricing\nCorporate treasury\nmanages a funds\ntransfer pricing\nmethodology that\nconsiders interest\nrate risk, liquidity\nrisk, and other\nproduct\ncharacteristics.\nOperating segments pay\na funding charge for\ntheir assets and\nreceive a funding\ncredit for their\ndeposits, both of\nwhich are included in\nnet interest income.\nThe net impact of the\nfunding charges or\ncredits is recognized\nin corporate treasury.\n\nRevenue and Expense\nSharing When lines of\nbusiness jointly serve\ncustomers, the line of\nbusiness that is\nresponsible for\nproviding the product\nor service recognizes\nrevenue or expense\nwith a referral fee\npaid or an allocation\nof cost to the other\nline of\n\nbusiness based on\nestablished internal\nrevenue-sharing\nagreements.\n\nWhen a line of\nbusiness uses a\nservice provided by\nanother line of\nbusiness or enterprise\nfunction (included in\nCorporate), expense is\ngenerally allocated\nbased on the cost and\nuse of the service\nprovided.\n\nTaxable-Equivalent\nAdjustments Taxable-\nequivalent adjustments\nrelated to tax-exempt\nincome on certain\nloans and debt\nsecurities are\nincluded in net\ninterest income, while\ntaxable-equivalent\nadjustments related to\nincome tax credits for\nlow-income housing and\nrenewable energy\ninvestments are\nincluded in\nnoninterest income, in\neach case with\ncorresponding impacts\nto income tax expense\n(benefit). Adjustments\nare included in\nCorporate, Commercial\nBanking, and Corporate\nand Investment Banking\nand are eliminated to\nreconcile to the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial results.\n\nAllocated Capital\nReportable operating\nsegments are allocated\ncapital under a risk-\nsensitive framework\nthat is primarily\nbased on aspects of\nour regulatory capital\nrequirements, and the\nassumptions and\nmethodologies used to\nallocate capital are\nperiodically assessed\nand revised.\nManagement believes\nthat return on\nallocated capital is a\nuseful financial\nmeasure because it\nenables management,\ninvestors, and others\nto assess a reportable\noperating segment\u2019s\nuse of capital.\n\nSelected Metrics We\npresent certain\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial metrics\nthat management uses\nwhen evaluating\nreportable operating\nsegment results.\nManagement believes\nthat these metrics are\nuseful to investors\nand others to assess\nthe performance,\ncustomer growth, and\ntrends of reportable\noperating segments or\nlines of business.\n                                              \n   Table 4:                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n   Management Reporting Structure             \n                                              \n                                              \n  W\u2026                                          \n  F\u2026                                          \n  &                                           \n  C\u2026                                          \n        Co\u2026           Co\u2026    W\u2026               \n        Ba\u2026    Co\u2026    and    a\u2026    Co\u2026        \n        and    Ba\u2026    In\u2026    I\u2026               \n        Le\u2026           Ba\u2026    M\u2026               \n                                          \u2022   \n        \u2022                                 C\u2026  \n        Co\u2026                               T\u2026  \n        and                               \u2022   \n        Sm\u2026                               E\u2026  \n        Bu\u2026    \u2022                          F\u2026  \n        Ba\u2026    Mi\u2026    \u2022      \u2022            \u2022   \n        \u2022      Ma\u2026    Ba\u2026    W\u2026           I\u2026  \n        Ho\u2026    Ba\u2026    \u2022      F\u2026           P\u2026  \n        Le\u2026    \u2022      Co\u2026    A\u2026           \u2022   \n        \u2022      As\u2026    Re\u2026    \u2022            A\u2026  \n        Cr\u2026    Le\u2026    Es\u2026    T\u2026           v\u2026  \n        Ca\u2026    and    \u2022      P\u2026           c\u2026  \n        \u2022      Le\u2026    Ma\u2026    B\u2026           a\u2026  \n        Au\u2026                               p\u2026  \n        \u2022                                 e\u2026  \n        Pe\u2026                               b\u2026  \n        Le\u2026                               \u2022   \n                                          N\u2026  \n                                          b\u2026  \n                                              \n                               \n  10    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 5 and the\nfollowing discussion\npresent our results by\nreportable operating\nsegment.

We employ various credit risk\nmanagement and monitoring activities to\nmitigate risks associated with multiple risk\nfactors affecting loans we hold including: \u2022\nLoan concentrations and related credit\nquality; \u2022 Counterparty credit risk; \u2022\nEconomic and market conditions;\n\n\u2022 Legislative or regulatory mandates; \u2022\nChanges in interest rates; \u2022 Merger and\nacquisition activities; and \u2022 Reputation risk.\nIn addition, the Company will continue to\nintegrate climate considerations into its\ncredit risk management activities. Our credit\nrisk management oversight process is governed\ncentrally, but provides for direct management\nand accountability by our lines of business.\nOur overall credit process includes\ncomprehensive credit policies, disciplined\ncredit underwriting, frequent and detailed\nrisk measurement and modeling, extensive\ncredit training programs, and a continual loan\nreview and audit process. A key to our credit\nrisk management is adherence to a well-\ncontrolled underwriting process, which we\nbelieve is appropriate for the needs of our\ncustomers as well as investors who purchase\nthe loans or securities collateralized by the\nloans. Credit Quality Overview Credit quality\nin first quarter 2022 reflected: \u2022 Nonaccrual\nloans were $6.9 billion at March 31, 2022,\ndown from $7.2 billion at December 31, 2021.\nCommercial nonaccrual loans decreased to $2.0\nbillion at March 31, 2022, compared with $2.4\nbillion at December 31, 2021, and consumer\nnonaccrual loans increased to $4.9 billion at\nMarch 31, 2022, compared with $4.8 billion at\nDecember 31, 2021. Nonaccrual loans\nrepresented 0.75% of total loans at March 31,\n2022, compared with 0.81% at December 31,\n2021. \u2022 Net loan charge-offs (recoveries) as a\npercentage of our average commercial and\nconsumer loan portfolios were (0.02)% and\n0.35%, respectively, in first quarter 2022,\ncompared with 0.13% and 0.37%, respectively,\nin first quarter 2021. \u2022 Loans that are not\ngovernment insured/guaranteed and 90 days or\nmore past due and still accruing were $267\nmillion and $409 million in our commercial and\nconsumer portfolios, respectively, at March\n31, 2022, compared with $235 million and $424\nmillion at December 31, 2021. \u2022 Our provision\nfor credit losses for loans was $(775) million\nin first quarter 2022, compared with $(1.1)\nbillion in first quarter 2021 . \u2022 The ACL for\nloans decreased to $12.7 billion, or 1.39% of\ntotal loans, at March 31, 2022, compared with\n$13.8 billion, or 1.54%, at December 31, 2021.\nAdditional information on our loan portfolios\nand our credit quality trends follows.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    27  \n                               \nRisk Management \u2013\nCredit Risk Management\n(continued)\n\nSignificant Loan\nPortfolio Reviews\nMeasuring and\nmonitoring our credit\nrisk is an ongoing\nprocess that tracks\ndelinquencies,\ncollateral values,\nFair Isaac Corporation\n(FICO) scores,\neconomic trends by\ngeographic areas,\nloan-level risk\ngrading for certain\nportfolios (typically\ncommercial) and other\nindications of credit\nrisk.

The change\nwas driven by\ndecreases in the real\nestate and\nconstruction,\ntechnology, telecom\nand media, oil, gas\nand pipelines, and\nretail industries, as\nthese industries\ncontinue to recover\nfrom the effects of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe majority of our\ncommercial and\nindustrial loans and\nlease financing\nportfolio is secured\nby short-term assets,\nsuch as accounts\nreceivable, inventory\nand debt securities,\nas well as long-lived\nassets, such as\nequipment and other\nbusiness assets.\nGenerally, the primary\nsource of repayment\nfor this portfolio is\nthe operating cash\nflows of customers,\nwith the collateral\nsecuring this\nportfolio representing\na secondary source of\nrepayment.\n\nThe portfolio\nincreased at March 31,\n2022, compared with\nDecember 31, 2021,\ndriven by higher loan\ndemand resulting in\nincreased originations\nand loan draws,\npartially offset by\npaydowns.

period\nin 2021, was due to\nlower losses in the\ncommercial and\nindustrial portfolio,\ndriven by higher\nrecoveries in the oil,\ngas, and pipeline\nindustry, and lower\nlosses in the real\nestate mortgage\nportfolio.\n\nThe decrease in\nconsumer net loan\ncharge-offs in first\nquarter 2022, compared\nwith the same period\nin 2021, was driven by\nlower losses in credit\ncard due to elevated\nlosses in first\nquarter 2021 and lower\nlosses in other\nconsumer due to the\nsale of a portion of\nour student loan\nportfolio in first\nquarter 2021,\npartially offset by an\nincrease in auto\nlosses reflecting\nreduced benefits for\ncustomers from\ngovernment stimulus\nprograms instituted in\nresponse to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic\nmay continue to impact\nthe credit quality of\nour loan portfolio.\nAlthough the potential\nimpacts were\nconsidered in our\nallowance for credit\nlosses for loans,\npayment deferral\nactivities in our\nresidential

Additionally, we\nmaintain an ACL for\ndebt securities\nclassified as either\nAFS or HTM, other\nfinancial assets\nmeasured at amortized\ncost, net investments\nin leases, and other\noff-balance sheet\ncredit exposures.\n\nWe apply a disciplined\nprocess and\nmethodology to\nestablish our ACL each\nquarter. The process\nfor establishing the\nACL for loans takes\ninto consideration\nmany factors,\nincluding historical\nand forecasted loss\ntrends, loan-level\ncredit quality ratings\nand loan grade-\nspecific\ncharacteristics. The\nprocess involves\nsubjective and complex\njudgments. In\naddition, we review a\nvariety of credit\nmetrics and trends.\nThese credit metrics\nand trends, however,\ndo not solely\ndetermine the amount\nof the allowance as we\nuse several analytical\ntools.

The ACL\nfor loans decreased\n$1.1 billion, or 8%,\nfrom December 31,\n2021, reflecting\nreduced uncertainty\naround the economic\nimpact of the COVID-19\npandemic on our loan\nportfolios and\nincreased uncertainty\nrelated to the risks\nof high inflation.

We\nconsider multiple\neconomic scenarios to\ndevelop our estimate\nof the ACL for loans,\nwhich generally\ninclude a base\nscenario, along with\nan optimistic (upside)\nand one or more\npessimistic (downside)\nscenarios. In our\nestimate of the ACL\nfor loans at March 31,\n2022, we weighted the\nbase scenario and the\ndownside scenarios to\nreflect our\nexpectations for\nreduced uncertainty\naround the economic\nimpact of the COVID-19\npandemic and increased\nuncertainty related to\ninflationary and\ngeopolitical risks.\nThe base scenario\nassumed solid economic\nconditions with\nelevated inflation in\nthe near term. The\ndownside scenarios\nassumed economic\ncontractions,\nincluding higher\ngeopolitical risks and\ninflation levels\nexceeding those in the\nbase scenario.\nAdditionally, we\nconsider qualitative\nfactors that represent\nrisks inherent in our\nprocesses and\nassumptions such as\neconomic environmental\nfactors, modeling\nassumptions and\nperformance, and other\nsubjective factors,\nincluding industry\ntrends and emerging\nrisk assessments. The\nforecasted key\neconomic variables\nused in our estimate\nof the ACL for loans\nat March 31, 2022, and\nDecember 31, 2021, are\npresented in Table 23.\n\nTable 23: Forecasted\nKey Economic Variables\n                                              \n               2Q           4Q           2Q   \n               20\u2026          20\u2026          20\u2026  \n  We\u2026                                         \n  bl\u2026                                         \n  of                                          \n  ec\u2026                                         \n  sc\u2026                                         \n  U.\u2026                                         \n  un\u2026                                         \n  ra\u2026                                         \n  (1\u2026                                         \n  De\u2026                                         \n  31,     4.8  %       5.4          5.9       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Ma\u2026                                         \n  31,     4.1          4.7          5.6       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  U.\u2026                                         \n  re\u2026                                         \n  GDP                                         \n  (2\u2026                                         \n  De\u2026                                         \n  31,     1.4         -0.3          1.4       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Ma\u2026                                         \n  31,     1.2         -0.6          0.2       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Ho\u2026                                         \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  in\u2026                                         \n  (3\u2026                                         \n  De\u2026                                         \n  31,     5.9         -4.3         -6.0       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Ma\u2026                                         \n  31,    12.2          2.1         -3.1       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Co\u2026                                         \n  re\u2026                                         \n  es\u2026                                         \n  as\u2026                                         \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  (3\u2026                                         \n  De\u2026                                         \n  31,     5.0         -4.2         -6.0       \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Ma\u2026                                         \n  31,    13.0          2.8         -2.7       \n  20\u2026                                         \n                                              \n(1) Quarterly average.\n(2) Percent change\nfrom the preceding\nperiod, seasonally\nadjusted annualized\nrate.

Future amounts\nof the ACL for loans\nwill be based on a\nvariety of factors,\nincluding loan balance\nchanges, portfolio\ncredit quality and mix\nchanges, and changes\nin general economic\nconditions and\nexpectations\n(including for\nunemployment and real\nGDP), among other\nfactors. We believe\nthe ACL for loans of\n$12.7 billion at March\n31, 2022, was\nappropriate to cover\nexpected credit\nlosses, including\nunfunded credit\ncommitments, at that\ndate. The entire\nallowance is available\nto absorb credit\nlosses from the total\nloan portfolio. The\nACL for loans is\nsubject to change and\nreflects existing\nfactors as of the date\nof determination,\nincluding economic or\nmarket conditions and\nongoing internal and\nexternal examination\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    39  \n                               \nprocesses. Due to the\nsensitivity of the ACL\nfor loans to changes\nin the economic and\nbusiness environment,\nit is possible that we\nwill incur incremental\ncredit losses not\nanticipated as of the\nbalance sheet date.\nOur process for\ndetermining the ACL is\ndiscussed in the\n\u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies \u2013 Allowance\nfor Credit Losses\u201d\nsection and Note 1\n(Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial\nStatements in our 2021\nForm 10-K.\n\nMORTGAGE BANKING\nACTIVITIES We sell\nresidential and\ncommercial mortgage\nloans to various\nparties. In connection\nwith our sales and\nsecuritization of\nresidential mortgage\nloans, we have\nestablished a mortgage\nrepurchase liability.\nFor information on our\nrepurchase liability,\nsee the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Credit\nRisk Management \u2013\nMortgage Banking\nActivities\u201d section in\nour 2021 Form 10-K.\n\nIn addition to\nservicing loans in our\nportfolio, we act as\nservicer and/or master\nservicer of\nresidential and\ncommercial mortgage\nloans included in\ngovernment sponsored\nentity\n(GSE)-guaranteed\nmortgage\nsecuritizations, GNMA-\nguaranteed mortgage\nsecuritizations of\nFHA-insured/VA-\nguaranteed mortgages\nand private label\nmortgage\nsecuritizations, as\nwell as for\nunsecuritized loans\nowned by institutional\ninvestors.\n\nAs a servicer, we are\nrequired to advance\ncertain delinquent\npayments of principal\nand interest on\nmortgage loans we\nservice. The amount\nand timing of\nreimbursement for\nadvances of delinquent\npayments vary by\ninvestor and the\napplicable servicing\nagreements. See Note 9\n(Mortgage Banking\nActivities) to\nFinancial Statements\nin this Report for\nadditional information\nabout residential and\ncommercial servicing\nrights, servicer\nadvances and servicing\nfees.\n\nIn accordance with\napplicable servicing\nguidelines,\ndelinquency status\ncontinues to advance\nfor loans with COVID-\nrelated payment\ndeferrals, which has\nresulted in an\nincrease in delinquent\nloans serviced for\nothers and a\ncorresponding increase\nin loans eligible for\nrepurchase from GNMA\nloan securitization\npools. Upon transfer\nas servicer, we retain\nthe option to\nrepurchase loans from\nGNMA loan\nsecuritization pools,\nwhich becomes\nexercisable when three\nscheduled loan\npayments remain unpaid\nby the borrower. We\ngenerally repurchase\nthese loans for cash\nand as a result, our\ntotal consolidated\nassets do not change.\nThese repurchased loan\nbalances were $14.2\nbillion and $17.3\nbillion at March 31,\n2022 and December 31,\n2021, respectively,\nwhich included $10.3\nbillion and $12.9\nbillion, respectively,\nin our held for\ninvestment loan\nportfolio, with the\nremainder in loans\nheld for sale.\n\nRepurchased loans that\nregain current status\nor are otherwise\nmodified in accordance\nwith applicable\nservicing guidelines\nmay be included in\nfuture GNMA loan\nsecuritization pools.\nHowever, in accordance\nwith guidance issued\nby GNMA, certain loans\nrepurchased after June\n30, 2020, are\nineligible for\ninclusion in future\nGNMA loan\nsecuritization pools\nuntil the borrower has\ntimely made six\nconsecutive payments.\nThis requirement may\ndelay our ability to\nresell loans into the\nsecuritization market.\nSee Note 8\n(Securitizations and\nVariable Interest\nEntities) to Financial\nStatements in this\nReport for additional\ninformation about our\ninvolvement with\nmortgage loan\nsecuritizations.\n\nFor additional\ninformation about the\nrisks related to our\nservicing activities,\nsee the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Credit\nRisk Management \u2013\nMortgage Banking\nActivities\u201d section in\nour 2021 Form 10-K.\nFor additional\ninformation on\nmortgage banking\nactivities, see Note 9\n(Mortgage Banking\nActivities) to\nFinancial Statements\nin this Report.\n                                              \n  Asset/Liability Management                  \n                                              \nAsset/liability\nmanagement involves\nevaluating, monitoring\nand managing interest\nrate risk, market\nrisk, liquidity and\nfunding. For\ninformation on our\noversight of\nasset/liability risks,\nsee the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement\u201d section in\nour 2021 Form 10-K.\n\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nInterest rate risk is\ncreated in our role as\na financial\nintermediary for\ncustomers based on\ninvestments such as\nloans and other\nextensions of credit\nand debt securities.\nInterest rate risk can\nhave a significant\nimpact to our\nearnings. We are\nsubject to interest\nrate risk because:\n\n\u2022 assets and\nliabilities may mature\nor reprice at\ndifferent times. If\nassets reprice faster\nthan liabilities and\ninterest rates are\ngenerally rising,\nearnings will\ninitially increase;\n\n\u2022 assets and\nliabilities may\nreprice at the same\ntime but by different\namounts;\n\n\u2022 short-term and long-\nterm market interest\nrates may change by\ndifferent amounts. For\nexample, the shape of\nthe yield curve may\naffect yield for new\nloans and funding\ncosts differently;\n\n\u2022 the remaining\nmaturity for various\nassets or liabilities\nmay shorten or\nlengthen as interest\nrates change. For\nexample, if long-term\nmortgage interest\nrates increase\nsharply, MBS held in\nthe debt securities\nportfolio may pay down\nat a slower rate than\nanticipated, which\ncould impact portfolio\nincome; or\n\n\u2022 interest rates may\nhave a direct or\nindirect effect on\nloan demand,\ncollateral values,\ncredit losses,\nmortgage origination\nvolume, and the fair\nvalue of MSRs and\nother financial\ninstruments.\n\nWe assess interest\nrate risk by comparing\noutcomes under various\nnet interest income\nsimulations using many\ninterest rate\nscenarios that differ\nin the direction of\ninterest rate changes,\nthe degree of change\nover time, the speed\nof change and the\nprojected shape of the\nyield curve. These\nsimulations require\nassumptions regarding\ndrivers of earnings\nand balance sheet\ncomposition such as\nloan originations,\nprepayment rates on\nloans and debt\nsecurities, deposit\nflows and mix, as well\nas pricing strategies.\n\nOur most recent\nsimulations, as\npresented in Table 24,\nestimate net interest\nincome sensitivity\nover the next 12\nmonths using\ninstantaneous\nmovements across the\nyield curve with both\nlower and higher\ninterest rates\nrelative to our base\nscenario. Steeper and\nflatter scenarios\nmeasure non-parallel\nchanges in the yield\ncurve, with long-term\ninterest rates defined\nas all tenors three\nyears and longer\n(e.g., 10-year U.S.\nTreasury securities)\nand short-term\ninterest rates defined\nas all tenors less\nthan three years.\nWhere applicable, U.S.\ndollar interest rates\nare floored at 0.00%.\nThe following\ndescribes the\nsimulation assumptions\nfor the scenarios\npresented in Table 24:\n\n\u2022 Simulations are\ndynamic and reflect\nanticipated changes to\nour assets and\nliabilities.\n\n\u2022 Other macroeconomic\nvariables that could\nbe correlated with the\nchanges in interest\nrates are held\nconstant.\n\n\u2022 Mortgage prepayment\nand origination\nassumptions vary\nacross scenarios and\nreflect only the\nimpact of the higher\nor lower interest\nrates.\n\n\u2022 Our base scenario\ndeposit forecast\nincorporates mix\nchanges consistent\nwith the base interest\nrate trajectory.\nDeposit mix is modeled\nto be the same as in\nthe base scenario\nacross the alternative\nscenarios. In higher\ninterest rate\nscenarios, customer\ndeposit activity that\nshifts balances into\nhigher-\n                               \n  40    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nyielding products\ncould impact expected\nnet interest income. \u2022\nDeposit rates paid may\nchange with market\ninterest rate changes.\nOur interest rate\nsensitivity of\ndeposits, referred to\nas deposit betas, is\nmodeled using the\nhistorical behavior of\nour deposits\nportfolio, including\ncertain customer\naccount migration.

Our\ninterest rate sensitivity indicates that we\nwould expect to benefit from higher interest\nrates as our assets would reprice faster and\nto a greater degree than our liabilities,\nwhile in the case of lower interest rates, our\nassets would reprice downward and to a greater\ndegree than our liabilities resulting in lower\nnet interest income. For the simulations with\ndownward shifts in interest rates, the 0.00%\ninterest rate floor limits the amount of the\ndecline in net interest income. We may have a\nlarger decline in net interest income when\ninterest rates increase for the base scenario\nrelative to the interest rate floor. The\nsensitivity results above do not capture\nnoninterest income or expense impacts. Our\ninterest rate sensitive noninterest income and\nexpense are predominantly driven by mortgage\nbanking activities, and may move in the\nopposite direction of our net interest income.\nSee the \u201cRisk Management \u2013 Asset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Mortgage Banking Interest Rate\nand Market Risk\u201d section in our 2021 Form 10-K\nfor additional information. For additional\ninformation on our trading assets and\nliabilities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities)\nto Financial Statements in this Report. We use\nthe debt securities portfolio and exchange-\ntraded and over-the-counter (OTC) interest\nrate derivatives to manage our interest rate\nexposures. As interest rates increase, changes\nin the fair value of AFS debt securities may\nnegatively affect cumulative other\ncomprehensive income, which lowers the amount\nof our risk-based capital. See Note 1 (Summary\nof Significant Accounting Policies), Note 3\n(Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt\nSecurities) and Note 14 (Derivatives) to\nFinancial Statements in our 2021 Form 10-K for\nadditional information. MORTGAGE BANKING\nINTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK We originate,\nfund and service mortgage loans, which\nsubjects us to various risks, including\ncredit, liquidity and interest rate risks. For\nadditional information on mortgage banking\ninterest rate and market risk, see Note 9\n(Mortgage Banking Activities) to\n\nFinancial Statements in this Report and the\n\u201cRisk Management \u2013 Asset/Liability Management\n\u2013 Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market\nRisk\u201d section in our 2021 Form 10-K. Hedging\nthe various sources of interest rate risk in\nmortgage banking is a complex process that\nrequires sophisticated modeling and constant\nmonitoring. There are several potential risks\nto earnings from mortgage banking related to\norigination volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs\nand associated hedging results, the\nrelationship and degree of volatility between\nshort-term and long-term interest rates, and\nchanges in servicing and foreclosures costs.\nWhile we attempt to balance our mortgage\nbanking interest rate and market risks, the\nfinancial instruments we use may not perfectly\ncorrelate with the values and income being\nhedged. MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of\npossible economic loss from adverse changes in\nmarket risk factors such as interest rates,\ncredit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity\nand commodity prices, and the risk of possible\nloss due to counterparty exposure. This\napplies to implied volatility risk, basis\nrisk, and market liquidity risk. It also\nincludes price risk in the trading book,\nmortgage servicing rights and the hedge\neffectiveness risk associated with the\nmortgage book, and impairment of private\nequity investments. For information on our\noversight of market risk, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Asset/Liability Management \u2013\nMarket Risk\u201d section in our 2021 Form 10-K.\nMARKET RISK \u2013 TRADING ACTIVITIES We engage in\ntrading activities to accommodate the\ninvestment and risk management activities of\nour customers and to execute economic hedging\nto manage certain balance sheet risks. These\ntrading activities predominantly occur within\nour CIB businesses and to a lesser extent\nother businesses of the Company. Debt\nsecurities held for trading, equity securities\nheld for trading, trading loans and trading\nderivatives are financial instruments used in\nour trading activities, and all are carried at\nfair value. Income earned on the financial\ninstruments used in our trading activities\ninclude net interest income, changes in fair\nvalue and realized gains and losses. Net\ninterest income earned from our trading\nactivities is reflected in the interest income\nand interest expense components of our\nconsolidated statement of income. Changes in\nfair value of the financial instruments used\nin our trading activities are reflected in net\ngains from trading activities. For additional\ninformation on the financial instruments used\nin our trading activities and the income from\nthese trading activities, see Note 2 (Trading\nActivities) to Financial Statements in this\nReport. Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical\nrisk measure used to estimate the potential\nloss from adverse moves in the financial\nmarkets. The Company uses VaR metrics\ncomplemented with sensitivity analysis and\nstress testing in measuring and monitoring\nmarket risk. For additional information on our\nmonitoring activities, sensitivity analysis\nand stress testing, see the \u201cRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability Management \u2013 Market Risk \u2013\nTrading Activities\u201d section in our 2021 Form\n10-K. Trading VaR is the measure used to\nprovide insight into the market risk exhibited\nby the Company\u2019s trading positions. The\nCompany calculates Trading VaR for risk\nmanagement purposes to establish line of\nbusiness and Company-wide risk limits. Trading\nVaR is calculated based on all trading\npositions on our consolidated balance sheet.\nTable 25 shows the Company\u2019s Trading General\nVaR by risk category. The decrease in average\nCompany Trading General VaR for the quarter\nended March 31, 2022, compared with the same\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    41  \n                               \nRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement (continued)\n\nperiod a year ago, was\ndriven by reduced\nmarket volatility in\nthe lookback window\nused to calculate\naverage Company\nTrading General VaR\nfor the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2022. Market\nvolatility present in\naverage Company\nTrading General VaR\nfor\n\nthe quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2021, was\ndriven by the impact\nof the COVID-19\npandemic, primarily\nresulting in changes\nin interest rate\ncurves and a\nsignificant widening\nof credit spreads.\n\nTable 25: Trading\n1-Day 99% General VaR\nby Risk Category\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) The period-end VaR\nwas less than the sum\nof the VaR components\ndescribed above, which\nis due to portfolio\ndiversification. The\ndiversification effect\narises because the\nrisks are not\nperfectly correlated\ncausing a portfolio of\npositions to usually\nbe less risky than the\nsum of the risks of\nthe positions alone.\nThe diversification\nbenefit is not\nmeaningful for low and\nhigh metrics since\nthey may occur on\ndifferent days.\n\nMARKET RISK \u2013 EQUITY\nSECURITIES We are\ndirectly and\nindirectly affected by\nchanges in the equity\nmarkets. We make and\nmanage direct\ninvestments in start-\nup businesses,\nemerging growth\ncompanies, management\nbuy-outs, acquisitions\nand corporate\nrecapitalizations. We\nalso invest in non-\naffiliated funds that\nmake similar private\nequity investments.\nFor additional\ninformation, see the\n\u201cRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Market\nRisk \u2013 Equity\nSecurities\u201d section in\nour 2021 Form 10-K.\n\nWe also have\nmarketable equity\nsecurities that\ninclude investments\nrelating to our\nventure capital\nactivities. The fair\nvalue changes in these\nmarketable equity\nsecurities are\nrecognized in net\nincome. For additional\ninformation, see Note\n6 (Equity Securities)\nto Financial\nStatements in this\nReport.\n\nChanges in equity\nmarket prices may also\nindirectly affect our\nnet income by (1) the\nvalue of third-party\nassets under\nmanagement and, hence,\nfee income, (2)\nborrowers whose\nability to repay\nprincipal and/or\ninterest may be\naffected by the stock\nmarket, or (3)\nbrokerage activity,\nrelated commission\nincome and other\nbusiness activities.\nEach business line\nmonitors and manages\nthese indirect risks.\n\nLIQUIDITY RISK AND\nFUNDING In the\nordinary course of\nbusiness, we enter\ninto contractual\nobligations that may\nrequire future cash\npayments, including\nfunding for customer\nloan requests,\ncustomer deposit\nmaturities and\nwithdrawals, debt\nservice, leases for\npremises and\nequipment, and other\ncash commitments. The\nobjective of effective\nliquidity management\nis to ensure that we\ncan meet our\ncontractual\nobligations and other\ncash commitments\nefficiently under both\nnormal operating\nconditions and under\nperiods of Wells\nFargo-specific and/or\nmarket stress. To help\nachieve this\nobjective, we monitor\nboth the consolidated\ncompany and the Parent\non a stand-alone basis\nto ensure that the\nParent is a source of\nstrength for its\nregulated, deposit-\ntaking banking\nsubsidiaries. The\nParent acts as a\nsource of funding for\nthe Company through\nthe issuance of long-\nterm debt and equity,\nand WFC Holdings, LLC,\nan intermediate\nholding company and\nsubsidiary of the\nParent (the \u201cIHC\u201d),\nprovides funding\nsupport for the\nongoing operational\nrequirements of the\nParent and certain of\nits direct and\nindirect subsidiaries.\nFor\n\nadditional information\non liquidity risk and\nfunding management,\nsee the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Liquidity\nRisk and Funding\u201d\nsection in our 2021\nForm 10-K. For\nadditional information\non the IHC, see the\n\u201cRegulatory Matters \u2013\n\u2018Living Will\u2019\nRequirements and\nRelated Matters\u201d\nsection in our 2021\nForm 10-K.\n\nLiquidity Standards We\nare subject to a rule\nissued by the FRB, OCC\nand FDIC that\nestablishes a\nquantitative minimum\nliquidity requirement\nconsistent with the\nliquidity coverage\nratio (LCR)\nestablished by the\nBasel Committee on\nBanking Supervision\n(BCBS). The rule\nrequires a covered\nbanking organization\nto hold high-quality\nliquid assets (HQLA)\nin an amount equal to\nor greater than its\nprojected net cash\noutflows during a\n30-day stress period.\nOur HQLA under the\nrule predominantly\nconsists of central\nbank deposits,\ngovernment debt\nsecurities, and\nmortgage-backed\nsecurities of federal\nagencies.

We are a\nmember of the FHLBs\nbased in Dallas, Des\nMoines and San\nFrancisco. FHLB\nmembers are required\nto maintain a minimum\ninvestment in capital\nstock of the\napplicable FHLB. The\nboard of directors of\neach FHLB can increase\nthe minimum investment\nrequirements in the\nevent it has concluded\nthat additional\ncapital is required to\nallow it to meet its\nown regulatory capital\nrequirements. Any\nincrease in the\nminimum investment\nrequirements outside\nof specified ranges\nrequires the approval\nof the Federal Housing\nFinance Agency.\nBecause the extent of\nany obligation to\nincrease our\ninvestment in any of\nthe FHLBs depends\nentirely upon the\noccurrence of a future\nevent, the amount of\nany future investment\nin the capital stock\nof the FHLBs is not\ndeterminable.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    45  \n                               \n                      \n  Capital Management  \n                      \nWe have an active\nprogram for managing\ncapital through a\ncomprehensive process\nfor assessing the\nCompany\u2019s overall\ncapital adequacy. Our\nobjective is to\nmaintain capital at an\namount commensurate\nwith our risk profile\nand risk tolerance\nobjectives, and to\nmeet both regulatory\nand market\nexpectations. We\nprimarily fund our\ncapital needs through\nthe retention of\nearnings net of both\ndividends and share\nrepurchases, as well\nas through the\nissuance of preferred\nstock and long- and\nshort-term debt.\nRetained earnings at\nMarch 31, 2022,\nincreased $2.3 billion\nfrom December 31,\n2021, predominantly as\na result of $3.7\nbillion of Wells Fargo\nnet income, partially\noffset by $1.3 billion\nof common and\npreferred stock\ndividends. During\nfirst quarter 2022, we\nissued $580 million of\ncommon stock,\nsubstantially all of\nwhich was issued in\nconnection with\nemployee compensation\nand benefits. In first\nquarter 2022, we\nrepurchased 110\nmillion shares of\ncommon stock at a cost\nof $6 billion. In\nfirst quarter 2022,\nour cumulative other\ncomprehensive income\ndecreased $5.1\nbillion, predominantly\ndue to net unrealized\nlosses on AFS debt\nsecurities. As\ninterest rates\nincrease, changes in\nthe fair value of AFS\ndebt securities may\nnegatively affect\ncumulative other\ncomprehensive income,\nwhich lowers the\namount of our risk-\nbased capital. For\nadditional information\nabout capital\nplanning, see the\n\u201cCapital Planning and\nStress Testing\u201d\nsection below.\n                                              \n  Regulatory Capital Requirements             \n                                              \nThe Company and each\nof our IDIs are\nsubject to various\nregulatory capital\nadequacy requirements\nadministered by the\nFRB and the OCC. Risk-\nbased capital rules\nestablish risk-\nadjusted ratios\nrelating regulatory\ncapital to different\ncategories of assets\nand off-balance sheet\nexposures as discussed\nbelow.\n\nRISK-BASED CAPITAL AND\nRISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS\nThe Company is subject\nto rules issued by\nfederal banking\nregulators to\nimplement Basel III\ncapital requirements\nfor U.S. banking\norganizations. The\nrules contain two\nframeworks for\ncalculating capital\nrequirements, a\nStandardized Approach\nand an Advanced\nApproach applicable to\ncertain institutions,\nincluding Wells Fargo,\nand we must calculate\nour risk-based capital\nratios under both\napproaches. The\nCompany is required to\nsatisfy the risk-based\ncapital ratio\nrequirements to avoid\nrestrictions on\ncapital distributions\nand discretionary\nbonus payments. Table\n31 and Table 32\npresent the risk-based\ncapital requirements\napplicable to the\nCompany under the\nStandardized Approach\nand Advanced Approach,\nrespectively, as of\nMarch 31, 2022.\n\nTable 31: Risk-Based\nCapital Requirements \u2013\nStandardized Approach\nas of March 31, 2022\n\nTable 32: Risk-Based\nCapital Requirements \u2013\nAdvanced Approach as\nof March 31, 2022\n\nIn addition to the\nrisk-based capital\nrequirements described\nin Table 31 and Table\n32, if the FRB\ndetermines that a\nperiod of excessive\ncredit growth is\ncontributing to an\nincrease in systemic\nrisk, a\ncountercyclical buffer\nof up to 2.50% could\nbe added to the risk-\nbased capital ratio\nrequirements under\nfederal banking\nregulations. The\ncountercyclical buffer\nin effect at March 31,\n2022, was 0.00%.\n\nThe capital\nconservation buffer is\napplicable to certain\ninstitutions,\nincluding Wells Fargo,\nunder the Advanced\nApproach and is\nintended to absorb\nlosses during times of\neconomic or financial\nstress.\n                               \n  46    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nThe stress capital\nbuffer is calculated\nbased on the decrease\nin a BHC\u2019s risk-based\ncapital ratios under\nthe severely adverse\nscenario in the FRB\u2019s\nannual supervisory\nstress test and\nrelated Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and\nReview (CCAR), plus\nfour quarters of\nplanned common stock\ndividends. Because the\nstress capital buffer\nis calculated annually\nbased on data that can\ndiffer over time, our\nstress capital buffer,\nand thus our risk-\nbased capital ratio\nrequirements under the\nStandardized Approach,\nare subject to change\nin future periods. Our\nstress capital buffer\nfor the period October\n1, 2021, through\nSeptember 30, 2022, is\n3.10%.\n\nAs a global\nsystemically important\nbank (G-SIB), we are\nalso subject to the\nFRB\u2019s rule\nimplementing an\nadditional capital\nsurcharge of between\n1.00-4.50% on the\nrisk-based capital\nratio requirements of\nG-SIBs. Under the\nrule, we must annually\ncalculate our\nsurcharge under two\nmethods and use the\nhigher of the two\nsurcharges. The first\nmethod (method one)\nconsiders our size,\ninterconnectedness,\ncross-jurisdictional\nactivity,\nsubstitutability, and\ncomplexity, consistent\nwith the methodology\ndeveloped by the BCBS\nand the Financial\nStability Board (FSB).\nThe second method\n(method two) uses\nsimilar inputs, but\nreplaces\nsubstitutability with\nuse of short-term\nwholesale funding and\nwill generally result\nin higher surcharges\nthan under method one.\nBecause the G-SIB\ncapital surcharge is\ncalculated annually\nbased on data that can\ndiffer over time, the\namount of the\nsurcharge is subject\nto change in future\nyears. If our annual\ncalculation\n\nresults in a decrease\nto our G-SIB capital\nsurcharge, the\ndecrease takes effect\nthe next calendar\nyear. If our annual\ncalculation results in\nan increase to our\nG-SIB capital\nsurcharge, the\nincrease takes effect\nin two calendar years.\nFor 2022, our G-SIB\ncapital surcharge is\n1.50%.\n\nUnder the risk-based\ncapital rules, on-\nbalance sheet assets\nand credit equivalent\namounts of derivatives\nand off-balance sheet\nitems are assigned to\none of several broad\nrisk categories\naccording to the\nobligor, or, if\nrelevant, the\nguarantor or the\nnature of any\ncollateral. The\naggregate dollar\namount in each risk\ncategory is then\nmultiplied by the risk\nweight associated with\nthat category. The\nresulting weighted\nvalues from each of\nthe risk categories\nare aggregated for\ndetermining total\nrisk-weighted assets\n(RWAs).\n\nEffective January 1,\n2022, we are required\nby federal\n\nbanking regulators to\nuse the Standardized\nApproach for\nCounterparty Credit\nRisk (SA-CCR) for\ncalculating exposure\namounts for credit\nRWAs on derivative\ncontracts. The\nadoption of SA-CCR\nresulted in an\nincrease of less than\n1.00% in total RWAs\nunder the Standardized\nApproach (our binding\napproach) in first\nquarter 2022.\n\nThe tables that follow\nprovide information\nabout our risk-based\ncapital and related\nratios as calculated\nunder Basel III\ncapital rules.

end.\n\n(2) In second quarter\n2020, the Company\nelected to apply a\nmodified transition\nprovision issued by\nfederal banking\nregulators related to\nthe impact of the\ncurrent expected\ncredit loss accounting\nstandard (CECL) on\nregulatory capital.\nThe rule permits\ncertain banking\norganizations to\nexclude from\nregulatory capital the\ninitial adoption\nimpact of CECL, plus\n25% of the cumulative\nchanges in the\nallowance for credit\nlosses (ACL) under\nCECL for each period\nuntil December 31,\n2021, followed by a\nthree-year phase-out\nperiod in which the\nbenefit is reduced

Capital\nPlanning and Stress\nTesting Our planned\nlong-term capital\nstructure is designed\nto meet regulatory and\nmarket expectations.\nWe believe that our\nlong-term targeted\ncapital structure\nenables us to invest\nin and grow our\nbusiness, satisfy our\ncustomers\u2019 financial\nneeds in varying\nenvironments, access\nmarkets, and maintain\nflexibility to return\ncapital to our\nshareholders. Our\nlong-term targeted\ncapital structure also\nconsiders capital\nlevels sufficient to\nexceed capital\nrequirements including\nthe G-SIB capital\nsurcharge.\nAccordingly, we\ncurrently target a\nlong-term CET1 capital\nratio that is 100\nbasis points above our\nregulatory requirement\nplus an incremental\nbuffer of 25 to 50\nbasis points. Our\ncapital targets are\nsubject to change\nbased on various\nfactors, including\nchanges to the\nregulatory\nrequirements for our\ncapital ratios,\nplanned capital\nactions, changes in\nour risk profile and\nother factors. The FRB\ncapital plan rule\nestablishes capital\nplanning and other\nrequirements that\ngovern capital\ndistributions,\nincluding dividends\nand share repurchases,\nby certain BHCs,\nincluding Wells Fargo.\nThe FRB assesses,\namong other things,\nthe overall financial\ncondition, risk\nprofile, and capital\nadequacy of BHCs when\nevaluating their\ncapital plans. We\nsubmitted our 2022\ncapital plan to the\nFRB prior to the April\n5, 2022, deadline. As\npart of the annual\nComprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review\n(CCAR), the FRB\ngenerated a\nsupervisory stress\ntest. The FRB is\nexpected to review the\nsupervisory stress\ntest results as\nrequired under the\nDodd-Frank Act using a\ncommon set of capital\nactions for all large\nBHCs and is also\nexpected to review the\nCompany's proposed\ncapital actions. The\nFRB has indicated it\nwill publish its\nsupervisory stress\ntest results by July\n1, 2022. Federal\nbanking regulators\nalso require large\nBHCs and banks to\nconduct their own\nstress tests to\nevaluate whether the\ninstitution has\nsufficient capital to\ncontinue to operate\nduring periods of\nadverse economic and\nfinancial conditions.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    51  \n                               \n                                              \n  Capital Management(continued)               \n                                              \n                                              \n  Securities Repurchases                      \n                                              \nFrom time to time the\nBoard authorizes the\nCompany to repurchase\nshares of our common\nstock. Although we\nannounce when the\nBoard authorizes share\nrepurchases, we\ntypically do not give\nany public notice\nbefore we repurchase\nour shares. Various\nfactors determine the\namount of our share\nrepurchases, including\nour capital\nrequirements, the\nnumber of shares we\nexpect to issue for\nemployee benefit plans\nand acquisitions,\nmarket conditions\n(including the trading\nprice of our stock),\nand regulatory and\nlegal considerations,\nincluding under the\nFRB\u2019s capital plan\nrule. Due to the\nvarious factors that\nmay impact the\n\namount of our share\nrepurchases and the\nfact that we tend to\nbe in the market\nregularly to satisfy\nrepurchase\nconsiderations under\nour capital plan, our\nshare repurchases\noccur at various price\nlevels. We may suspend\nshare repurchase\nactivity at any time.\n\nAt March 31, 2022, we\nhad remaining Board\nauthority to\nrepurchase\napproximately 251\nmillion shares,\nsubject to regulatory\nand legal conditions.\nFor additional\ninformation about\nshare repurchases\nduring first quarter\n2022, see Part II,\nItem 2 in this Report.\n                      \n  Regulatory Matters  \n                      \nThe U.S. financial\nservices industry is\nsubject to significant\nregulation and\nregulatory oversight\ninitiatives. This\nregulation and\noversight may continue\nto impact how U.S.\nfinancial services\ncompanies conduct\nbusiness and may\ncontinue to result in\nincreased regulatory\ncompliance costs.\n\nFor a discussion of\ncertain consent orders\napplicable to the\nCompany, see the\n\u201cOverview\u201d section in\nthis Report.

For\nexample, federal\nbanking regulators are\nreviewing the\nimplications of\nclimate change on the\nfinancial stability of\nthe United States and\nthe identification and\nmanagement by large\nbanks of climate-\nrelated financial\nrisks. In addition,\nthe SEC has proposed\nrules that would\nrequire public\ncompanies to disclose\ncertain climate-\nrelated information,\nincluding greenhouse\ngas emissions,\nclimate-related\ntargets and goals, and\ngovernance of climate-\nrelated risks and\nrelevant risk\nmanagement processes.\nThe approaches taken\nby various governments\nand government\nagencies can vary\nsignificantly, evolve\nover time, and\nsometimes conflict.\nAny current or future\nrules, regulations,\nand guidance related\nto climate change and\nits impacts could\nrequire us to change\ncertain of our\nbusiness practices,\nreduce our revenue and\nearnings, impose\nadditional costs on\nus, or otherwise\nadversely affect our\nbusiness operations\nand/or competitive\nposition.\n                               \n  52    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \n                                \n  Critical Accounting Policies  \n                                \nOur significant\naccounting policies\n(see Note 1 (Summary\nof Significant\nAccounting Policies)\nto Financial\nStatements in our 2021\nForm 10-K) are\nfundamental to\nunderstanding our\nresults of operations\nand financial\ncondition because they\nrequire that we use\nestimates and\nassumptions that may\naffect the value of\nour assets or\nliabilities and\nfinancial results. Six\nof these policies are\ncritical because they\nrequire management to\nmake difficult,\nsubjective and complex\njudgments about\nmatters that are\ninherently uncertain\nand because it is\nlikely that materially\ndifferent amounts\nwould be reported\nunder different\nconditions or using\ndifferent assumptions.\nThese policies govern:\n\n\u2022 the allowance for\ncredit losses;\n\n\u2022 the valuation of\nresidential MSRs;\n\n\u2022 the fair value of\nfinancial instruments;\n\n\u2022 income taxes;\n\n\u2022 liability for\ncontingent litigation\nlosses; and\n\n\u2022 goodwill impairment.\n\nManagement has\ndiscussed these\ncritical accounting\npolicies and the\nrelated estimates and\njudgments with the\nBoard\u2019s Audit\nCommittee.

We provide\nbanking, investment and mortgage products and\nservices, as well as consumer and commercial\nfinance, through banking locations and\noffices, the internet and other distribution\nchannels to individuals, businesses and\ninstitutions in all 50 states, the District of\nColumbia, and in countries outside the U.S.\nWhen we refer to \u201cWells Fargo,\u201d \u201cthe Company,\u201d\n\u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus,\u201d we mean Wells Fargo &\nCompany and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells\nFargo & Company (the Parent) is a financial\nholding company and a bank holding company. We\nalso hold a majority interest in a real estate\ninvestment trust, which has publicly traded\npreferred stock outstanding. Our accounting\nand reporting policies conform with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP) and practices in the financial services\nindustry. For discussion of our significant\naccounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 (2021 Form 10-K). There were\nno material changes to these policies in first\nquarter 2022. To prepare the financial\nstatements in conformity with GAAP, management\nmust make estimates based on assumptions about\nfuture economic and market conditions (for\nexample, unemployment, market liquidity, real\nestate prices, etc.) that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities at the date\nof the financial statements, income and\nexpenses during the reporting period and the\nrelated disclosures. Although our estimates\ncontemplate current conditions and how we\nexpect them to change in the future, it is\nreasonably possible that actual conditions\ncould be worse than anticipated in those\nestimates, which could materially affect our\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nManagement has made significant estimates in\nseveral areas, including: \u2022 allowance for\ncredit losses (Note 4 (Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit Losses)); \u2022 valuations of\nresidential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)\n(Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities) and Note 9 (Mortgage Banking\nActivities)); \u2022 valuations of financial\ninstruments (Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets\nand Liabilities)); \u2022 liabilities for\ncontingent litigation losses (Note 13 (Legal\nActions)); \u2022 income taxes; and \u2022 goodwill\nimpairment (Note 10 (Intangible Assets)).\nActual results could differ from those\nestimates. These unaudited interim financial\nstatements reflect all adjustments that are,\nin the opinion of management, necessary for a\nfair statement of the results for the periods\npresented. These adjustments are of a normal\nrecurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed\nin this Form 10-Q. The results of operations\nin the interim financial statements do not\nnecessarily indicate the results that may be\nexpected for the full year. The interim\nfinancial information should be read in\nconjunction with our 2021 Form 10-K.\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2022 In 2022,\nwe adopted the following new accounting\nguidance: \u2022 Accounting Standards Update (ASU\nor Update) 2020-06 \u2013 Debt \u2013 Debt with\nConversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20)\nand Derivatives and Hedging \u2013 Contracts in\nEntity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40):\nAccounting for Convertible Instruments and\nContracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity \u2022 ASU\n2021-05 \u2013 Leases (Topic 842): Lessors \u2013\nCertain Leases with Variable Lease Payments\nASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for\nconvertible financial instruments that embody\ncharacteristics of debt and equity by (1)\neliminating accounting models for convertible\nfinancial instruments with cash conversion and\nbeneficial conversion features within\nAccounting Standards Codification (ASC)\n470-20, (2) removing three equity\nclassification requirements for a contract in\nan entity's own equity to qualify for the\nderivative scope exception in ASC Subtopic\n815-40, and (3) prescribing the method used\nfor computing earnings per share. We adopted\nthis Update prospectively in first quarter\n2022. This Update did not have a material\nimpact to our consolidated financial\nstatements. ASU 2021-05 amends ASC 842 Topic \u2013\nLeases and provides specific guidance for\nlessors whose leases include variable lease\npayments that are not dependent on a reference\nindex or rate and otherwise would have\nresulted in the recognition of a loss at lease\ncommencement (a day 1 loss). Prior to ASU\n2016-02, variable lease payments were excluded\nfrom the definition of lease payments for\nlessors measuring their net investment loss in\na sales-type lease or direct financing lease.\nThis often resulted in a day 1 loss, even if\nthe lessor expected the arrangement to be\nprofitable overall.

The credit quality\nindicators that we most closely monitor\ninclude credit ratings and delinquency status\nand are based on information as of our\nfinancial statement date. CREDIT RATINGS\nCredit ratings express opinions about the\ncredit quality of a debt security. We\ndetermine the credit rating of a security\naccording to the lowest credit rating made\navailable by national recognized statistical\nrating organizations (NRSROs). Debt securities\nrated investment grade, that is those with\nratings similar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as\ndefined by NRSROs, are generally considered by\nthe rating agencies and market participants to\nbe low credit risk. Conversely, debt\nsecurities rated below investment grade,\nlabeled as \u201cspeculative grade\u201d by the rating\nagencies, are considered to be distinctively\nhigher credit risk than investment grade debt\nsecurities. For debt securities not rated by\nNRSROs, we determine an internal credit grade\nof the debt securities (used for credit risk\nmanagement purposes) equivalent to the credit\nratings assigned by major credit agencies.\nSubstantially all of our debt securities were\nrated by NRSROs at March 31, 2022, and\nDecember 31, 2021. Table 3.4 shows the\npercentage of fair value of AFS debt\nsecurities and amortized cost of HTM debt\nsecurities determined to be rated investment\ngrade, inclusive of securities rated based

are\ndelinquent in payment of amounts due under\ncontractual debt agreements have a higher\nprobability of recognition of credit losses.\nAs such, as part of our monitoring of the\ncredit quality of the debt security portfolio,\nwe consider whether debt securities we own are\npast due in payment of principal or interest\npayments and whether any securities have been\nplaced into nonaccrual status. Debt securities\nthat are past due and still accruing were\ninsignificant at both March 31, 2022, and\nDecember 31, 2021. The carrying value of debt\nsecurities in nonaccrual status was\ninsignificant at both March 31, 2022, and\nDecember 31, 2021. Charge-offs on debt\nsecurities were insignificant in the first\nquarter of both 2022 and 2021. Purchased debt\nsecurities with credit deterioration (PCD) are\nnot considered to be in nonaccrual status, as\npayments from issuers of these securities\nremain current. PCD securities were\ninsignificant in the first quarter of both\n2022 and 2021.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    69  \n                               \nNote 3: Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\nMaturity Debt Securities (continued)\n\nUnrealized Losses of Available-for-Sale Debt\nSecurities Table 3.5 shows the gross\nunrealized losses and fair value of AFS debt\nsecurities by length of time those individual\nsecurities in each category have been in a\ncontinuous loss position.

Credit\nimpairment is recorded as an ACL for debt\nsecurities.

We\ngenerally require a\nfee to extend such\ncommitments. Certain\ncommitments either\nprovide us with\nfunding discretion or\nare subject to loan\nagreements with\ncovenants regarding\nthe financial\nperformance of the\ncustomer or borrowing\nbase formulas on an\nongoing basis that\nmust be met before we\nare required to fund\nthe commitment. We may\nreduce or cancel\nconsumer commitments,\nincluding home equity\nlines and credit card\nlines, in accordance\nwith the contracts and\napplicable law. For\nunconditionally\ncancelable commitments\nat our discretion, we\ndo not recognize an\nACL. We may, as a\nrepresentative for\nother lenders, advance\nfunds or provide for\nthe issuance of\nletters of credit\nunder syndicated loan\nor letter of credit\nagreements. Any\nadvances are generally\nrepaid in less than a\nweek and would\nnormally require\ndefault of both the\ncustomer and another\nlender to expose us to\nloss. The unfunded\namount of these\ntemporary advance\narrangements totaled\napproximately $\n90.6billion at March\n31, 2022. We issue\ncommercial letters of\ncredit to assist\ncustomers in\npurchasing goods or\nservices, typically\nfor international\ntrade. At March 31,\n2022, and December 31,\n2021, we had $\n1.9billion and $\n1.5billion,\nrespectively, of\noutstanding issued\ncommercial letters of\ncredit. We also\noriginate multipurpose\nlending commitments\nunder which borrowers\nhave the option to\ndraw on the facility\nfor different purposes\nin one of several\nforms, including a\nstandby letter of\ncredit. See Note 11\n(Guarantees and Other\nCommitments) for\nadditional information\non standby letters of\ncredit. When we enter\ninto commitments, we\nare exposed to credit\nrisk. The maximum\ncredit risk for these\ncommitments will\ngenerally be lower\nthan the contractual\namount because a\nsignificant portion of\nthese commitments are\nnot funded. We manage\nthe potential risk in\ncommitments to lend by\nlimiting the total\namount of commitments,\nboth by individual\ncustomer and in total,\nby monitoring the size\nand maturity structure\nof these commitments\nand by applying the\nsame credit standards\nfor these commitments\nas for all of our\ncredit activities.\n\nFor loans and\ncommitments to lend,\nwe generally require\ncollateral or a\nguarantee. We may\nrequire various types\nof collateral,\nincluding commercial\nand consumer real\nestate, autos, other\nshort-term liquid\nassets such as\naccounts receivable or\ninventory and long-\nlived assets, such as\nequipment and other\nbusiness assets.\nCollateral\nrequirements for each\nloan or commitment may\nvary based on the loan\nproduct and our\nassessment of a\ncustomer\u2019s credit risk\naccording to the\nspecific credit\nunderwriting,\nincluding credit terms\nand structure.\nThe contractual amount\nof our unfunded credit\ncommitments, including\nunissued standby and\ncommercial letters of\ncredit, is summarized\nby portfolio segment\nand class of financing\nreceivable in Table\n4.4.

evaluation of the\nappropriateness of the ACL for loans. The\nfollowing sections provide the credit quality\nindicators we most closely monitor. The credit\nquality indicators are generally based on\ninformation as of our financial statement\ndate. COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS We\nmanage a consistent process for assessing\ncommercial loan credit quality. Commercial\nloans are generally subject to individual risk\nassessment using our internal borrower and\ncollateral quality ratings, which is our\nprimary credit quality indicator. Our ratings\nare aligned to regulatory definitions of pass\nand criticized categories with the criticized\nsegmented among special mention, substandard,\ndoubtful and loss categories. Table 4.7\nprovides the outstanding balances of our\ncommercial loan portfolio by risk category and\ncredit quality information by origination year\nfor term loans. Revolving loans may convert to\nterm loans as a result of a contractual\nprovision in the original loan agreement or if\nmodified in a troubled debt restructuring\n(TDR).

Loan delinquency, FICO\ncredit scores and loan-to-value (LTV) for\nresidential mortgage loans are the primary\ncredit quality indicators that we monitor and\nutilize in our evaluation of the\nappropriateness of the ACL for the consumer\nloan portfolio segment. Many of our loss\nestimation techniques used for the ACL for\nloans rely on delinquency-based models;\ntherefore, delinquency is an important\nindicator of credit quality in the\nestablishment of our ACL for consumer loans.\nTable 4.9 provides the outstanding balances of\nour consumer loan portfolio by delinquency\nstatus. Credit quality information is provided\nwith the year of origination for term loans.\nRevolving loans may convert to term loans as a\nresult of a contractual provision in the\noriginal loan agreement or if modified in a\nTDR. The revolving loans converted to term\nloans in the credit card loan category\nrepresent credit card loans with modified\nterms that require payment over a specific\nterm. Payment deferral activities in the\nresidential mortgage portfolio instituted in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic could\ncontinue to delay the recognition of\ndelinquencies for residential mortgage\ncustomers who otherwise would have moved into\npast due status.\n                               \n  78    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 4.9: Consumer Loan

principal balance to the property\u2019s\ncollateral value. Combined LTV (CLTV) refers\nto the combination of first lien mortgage and\njunior lien mortgage (including unused line\namounts for credit line products) ratios. We\nobtain LTVs and CLTVs using a cascade approach\nwhich first uses values provided by automated\nvaluation models (AVMs) for the property. If\nan AVM is not available, then the value is\nestimated using the original appraised value\nadjusted by the change in Home Price Index\n(HPI) for the property location. If an HPI is\nnot available, the original appraised value is\nused. The HPI value is normally the only\nmethod considered for high value properties,\ngenerally with an original value of $ 1million\nor more, as the AVM values have proven less\naccurate for these properties. Generally, we\nobtain available LTVs\n                               \n  82    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nand CLTVs on a quarterly basis.

Under the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau guidelines, we do\nnot commence the foreclosure process on\nresidential mortgage loans until after the\nloan is 120 days delinquent. Foreclosure\nprocedures and timelines vary depending on\nwhether the property address resides in a\njudicial or non-judicial state. Judicial\nstates require the foreclosure to be processed\nthrough the state\u2019s courts while non-judicial\nstates are processed without court\nintervention. Foreclosure timelines vary\naccording to state law.\n                               \n  84    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nLOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE\nPAST DUE AND STILL\nACCRUING Certain loans\n90 days or more past\ndue are still\naccruing, because they\nare (1) well-secured\nand in the process of\ncollection or (2)\nresidential mortgage\nor consumer loans\nexempt under\nregulatory rules from\nbeing classified as\nnonaccrual until later\ndelinquency, usually\n120 days past due.\nTable 4.13 shows loans\n90 days or more past\ndue and still accruing\nby class for loans not\ngovernment\ninsured/guaranteed.\nTable 4.13: Loans 90\nDays or More Past Due\nand Still Accruing\n                                              \n                     Mar              Dec     \n  ($ in              31,              31,     \n  mill\u2026              2022             2021    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Tota\u2026    $  4,011            5,358          \n  Less:                                       \n  FHA                                         \n  insu\u2026       3,335            4,699          \n  guar\u2026                                       \n  (1)                                         \n  Tota\u2026                                       \n  not      $    676              659          \n  gove\u2026                                       \n  insu\u2026                                       \n  By                                          \n  segm\u2026                                       \n  and                                         \n  clas\u2026                                       \n  not                                         \n  gove\u2026                                       \n  insu\u2026                                       \n                                              \n  Comm\u2026                                       \n  Comm\u2026                                       \n  and      $    186              206          \n  indu\u2026                                       \n  Real                                        \n  esta\u2026          80               29          \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  Real                                        \n  esta\u2026           1                \u2014          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  Total         267              235          \n  comm\u2026                                       \n  Cons\u2026                                       \n  Resi\u2026                                       \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  \u2013              14               37          \n  first                                       \n  lien                                        \n  Resi\u2026                                       \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  \u2013               6               12          \n  juni\u2026                                       \n  lien                                        \n  Cred\u2026         294              269          \n  card                                        \n  Auto           79               88          \n  Other          16               18          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  Total         409              424          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  Tota\u2026                                       \n  not      $    676              659          \n  gove\u2026                                       \n  insu\u2026                                       \n                                              \n(1) Represents loans\nwhose repayments are\npredominantly insured\nby the FHA or\nguaranteed by the VA.\nTROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs) When, for\neconomic or legal reasons related to a\nborrower\u2019s financial difficulties, we grant a\nconcession for other than an insignificant\nperiod of time to a borrower that we would not\notherwise consider, the related loan is\nclassified as a TDR, the balance of which\ntotaled $ 9.7billion and $ 10.2billion at\nMarch 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively. We do not consider loan\nresolutions such as foreclosure or short sale\nto be a TDR. In addition, COVID-related\nmodifications are generally not classified as\nTDRs due to the relief under the CARES Act and\nthe Interagency Statement. For additional\ninformation on the TDR relief, see Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies)\nin our 2021 Form 10-K. We may require some\nconsumer borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty to make trial payments generally\nfor a period of three to four months,\naccording to the terms of a planned permanent\nmodification, to determine if they can perform\naccording to those terms. These arrangements\nrepresent trial modifications, which we\nclassify and account for as TDRs. While loans\nare in trial payment programs, their original\nterms are not considered modified and they\ncontinue to advance through delinquency status\nand accrue interest according to their\noriginal terms. Commitments to lend additional\nfunds on loans whose terms have been modified\nin a TDR amounted to $ 471million and $\n431million at March 31, 2022, and December 31,\n2021, respectively. Table 4.14 summarizes our\nTDR modifications for the periods presented by\nprimary modification type and includes the\nfinancial effects of these modifications. For\nthose loans that modify more than once, the\ntable reflects each modification that occurred\nduring the period. Loans that both modify and\nare paid off or written-off within the period,\nas well as changes in recorded investment\nduring the period for loans modified in prior\nperiods, are not included in the table.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    85  \n                               \nNote 4: Loans and Related Allowance for Credit\nLosses (continued)\n\nTable 4.14: TDR Modifications\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Amounts represent the recorded investment\nin loans after recognizing the effects of the\nTDR, if any.

various types of on- and off-\nbalance sheet transactions with special\npurpose entities (SPEs), which are\ncorporations, trusts, limited liability\ncompanies or partnerships that are established\nfor a limited purpose. SPEs are often formed\nin connection with securitization transactions\nwhereby financial assets are transferred to an\nSPE. SPEs formed in connection with\nsecuritization transactions are generally\nconsidered variable interest entities (VIEs).\nThe VIE may alter the risk profile of the\nasset by entering into derivative transactions\nor obtaining credit support, and issues\nvarious forms of interests in those assets to\ninvestors. When we transfer financial assets\nfrom our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE\nin connection with a securitization, we\ntypically receive cash and sometimes other\ninterests in the VIE as proceeds for the\nassets we transfer. In certain transactions\nwith VIEs, we may retain the right to service\nthe transferred assets and repurchase the\ntransferred assets if the outstanding balance\nof the assets falls below the level at which\nthe cost to service the assets exceed the\nbenefits. In addition, we may purchase the\nright to service loans transferred to a VIE by\na third party. In connection with our\nsecuritization or other VIE activities, we\nhave various forms of ongoing involvement with\nVIEs, which may include: \u2022 underwriting\nsecurities issued by VIEs and subsequently\nmaking markets in those securities; \u2022\nproviding credit enhancement on securities\nissued by VIEs through the use of letters of\ncredit or financial guarantees; \u2022 entering\ninto other derivative contracts with VIEs; \u2022\nholding senior or subordinated interests in\nVIEs; \u2022 acting as servicer or investment\nmanager for VIEs; \u2022 providing administrative\nor trustee services to VIEs; and \u2022 providing\nseller financing to VIEs. Loan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity We periodically\ntransfer consumer and commercial loans and\nother types of financial assets in\nsecuritization and whole loan sale\ntransactions. MORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S.\nGOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS\nWITH GINNIE MAE In the normal course of\nbusiness we sell originated and purchased\nresidential and commercial mortgage loans to\ngovernment-sponsored entities (GSEs). These\nloans are generally transferred into\nsecuritizations sponsored by the GSEs, which\nprovide certain credit guarantees to investors\nand servicers. We also transfer mortgage loans\ninto securitizations pursuant to Government\nNational Mortgage Association (GNMA)\nguidelines which are insured by the Federal\nHousing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\nMortgage loans eligible for securitization\nwith the GSEs or GNMA are considered\nconforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA design the\nstructure of these securitizations, sponsor\nthe involved VIEs, and have power over the\nactivities most significant to the VIE. We\naccount for loans transferred in conforming\nmortgage loan securitization transactions as\nsales and do not consolidate the VIEs as we\nare not the primary beneficiary. In exchange\nfor the transfer of loans, we typically\nreceive securities issued by the VIEs which we\nsell to third parties for cash or hold for\ninvestment purposes as HTM or AFS securities.\nWe also retain servicing rights on the\ntransferred loans. As a servicer, we retain\nthe option to repurchase loans from GNMA loan\nsecuritization pools, which becomes\nexercisable when three scheduled loan payments\nremain unpaid by the borrower. During the\nquarters ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, we\nrepurchased loans of $ 933million and $\n1.9billion, respectively, which predominantly\nrepresented repurchases of government insured\nloans. We recorded assets and related\nliabilities of $ 35million and $ 107million at\nMarch 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively, where we did not exercise our\noption to repurchase eligible loans. Upon\ntransfers of loans, we also provide\nindemnification for losses incurred due to\nmaterial breaches of contractual\nrepresentations and warranties, as well as\nother recourse arrangements. At March 31,\n2022, and December 31, 2021, our liability for\nthese repurchase and recourse arrangements was\n$ 164million and $ 173million, respectively,\nand the maximum exposure to loss was $\n13.3billion at both March 31, 2022, and\nDecember 31, 2021. Loans serviced for others\npresented in Table 8.3 are predominantly loans\nsecuritized by the GSEs and GNMA. See Note 9\n(Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional\ninformation about residential and commercial\nservicing rights, advances and servicing fees.\nSubstantially all residential servicing\nactivity is related to assets transferred to\nGSE and GNMA securitizations. NONCONFORMING\nMORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS In the normal\ncourse of business, we sell nonconforming\nresidential and commercial mortgage loans in\nsecuritization transactions that we design and\nsponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan\nsecuritizations do not involve a government\ncredit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial\ninterest holders are subject to credit risk of\nthe underlying assets held by the\nsecuritization VIE. We typically originate the\ntransferred loans, account for the transfers\nas sales and do not consolidate the VIE. We\nalso typically retain the right to service the\nloans and may hold other beneficial interests\nissued by the VIEs, such as debt securities\nheld for investment purposes. Our servicing\nrole related to nonconforming commercial\nmortgage loan securitizations is limited to\nprimary or master servicer and the most\nsignificant decisions impacting the\nperformance of the VIE are generally made by\nthe special servicer or the controlling class\nsecurity holder. For our residential\nnonconforming mortgage loan securitizations\naccounted for as sales, we either do not hold\nvariable interests that we consider\npotentially significant or are not the primary\nservicer for a majority of the VIE assets.\nWHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We also sell\nwhole loans to VIEs where we have continuing\ninvolvement in the form of financing. We\naccount for these transfers as sales, and do\nnot consolidate the VIEs as we do not have the\npower to direct the most significant\nactivities of the VIEs. Table 8.1 presents\ninformation about transfers of assets during\nthe period for which we recorded the transfers\nas sales and have continuing involvement with\nthe transferred assets. In connection with\nthese transfers, we received proceeds and\nrecorded servicing assets, securities, and\nloans. Each of these interests are initially\nmeasured at fair value. Servicing rights are\nclassified as Level 3 measurements, and\ngenerally securities are classified as Level\n2. Substantially all transfers were related to\nresidential mortgage securitizations with the\nGSEs or GNMA and resulted in nogain or loss\nbecause the loans are already measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis. Additionally, we\nmay transfer certain government insured loans\nthat we previously\n                               \n  92    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nrepurchased. These loans are carried at the\nlower of cost or market, and we recognize\ngains on such transfers when the market value\nis greater than the carrying value of the loan\nwhen it is sold.\n\nTable 8.1: Transfers with Continuing\nInvolvement\n                                              \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                     2\u2026                2\u2026  \n  \u2026           R\u2026        C\u2026       R\u2026       C\u2026  \n  \u2026           m\u2026        m\u2026       m\u2026       m\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026    $  2\u2026        4\u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       2\u2026        4\u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       52        64        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  3\u2026        29        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1\u2026        1\u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        \u2014         \u2014        \u2026        \u2014      \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(1) Represents cash\nproceeds and the fair\nvalue of non-cash\nbeneficial interests\nrecognized at\nsecuritization\nsettlement.\n\n(2) Represents assets\nor liabilities\nrecognized at\nsecuritization\nsettlement date\nrelated to our\ncontinuing involvement\nin the transferred\nassets.\n\n(3) Represents debt\nsecurities obtained at\nsecuritization\nsettlement held for\ninvestment purposes\nthat are classified as\navailable-for-sale or\nheld-to-maturity,\nwhich predominantly\nrelate to agency\nsecurities.

In resecuritization\ntransactions, we transfer trading debt\nsecurities to VIEs in exchange for new\nbeneficial interests that are sold to third\nparties at or shortly after securitization\nsettlement. This activity is performed for\ncustomers seeking a specific return or risk\nprofile. Substantially all of our transactions\ninvolve the resecuritization of conforming\nmortgage-backed securities issued by the GSEs\nor GNMA. We do not consolidate the\nresecuritization VIEs as we share in the\ndecision-making power with third parties and\ndo not hold significant economic interests in\nthe VIEs other than for market-making\nactivities. We transferred $ 6.4billion and $\n17.4billion of securities to re-securitization\nVIEs during the quarters ended March 31, 2022\nand 2021, respectively. These amounts are not\nincluded in Table 8.1. Related total VIE\nassets were $ 115.9billion and $ 117.7billion\nat March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively. As of March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021 we held $ 1.3billion and $\n817million of securities, respectively. $\n738million and $ 1.0billion of these\nsecurities related to resecuritizations\ntransacted during the quarters ended March 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    93  \n                               \nNote 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities (continued)\n\nLoans Serviced for Others Table 8.3 presents\ninformation about loans that we sold or\nsecuritized in which we have ongoing\ninvolvement as servicer. These are primarily\nresidential mortgage loans sold to the GSEs or\nGNMA. Delinquent loans include loans 90 days\nor more past due and loans in bankruptcy,\nregardless of delinquency status. For loans\nsold or securitized where servicing is our\nonly form of continuing involvement, we\ngenerally experience a loss only if we were\nrequired to repurchase a delinquent loan or\nforeclosed asset due to a breach in\nrepresentations and warranties associated with\nour loan sale or servicing contracts.\n\nTable 8.3: Loans Serviced for Others\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      4      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      3      6    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      7      \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) Includes $ 444million and $ 403million of\ncommercial foreclosed assets and $ 145million\nand $ 129million of residential foreclosed\nassets at March 31, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, respectively.\n\n(2) Net charge-offs exclude loans sold to\nFNMA, FHLMC and GNMA as we do not service or\nmanage the underlying real estate upon\nforeclosure and, as such, do not have access\nto net charge-off information.\n\n(3) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nthe table includes total loans of $\n725.5billion and $ 736.8billion, delinquent\nloans of $ 8.0billion and $ 10.2billion, and\nforeclosed assets of $ 114million and $\n100million, respectively, for FNMA, FHLMC and\nGNMA.\n\nTransactions with Unconsolidated VIEs MORTGAGE\nLOAN SECURITIZATIONS Table 8.4 includes\nnonconforming mortgage loan securitizations\nwhere we originate and transfer the loans to\nthe unconsolidated securitization VIEs that we\nsponsor. For additional information about\nthese VIEs, see the \u201cLoan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity\u201d section within this\nNote. Nonconforming mortgage loan\nsecuritizations also include commercial\nmortgage loan securitizations sponsored by\nthird parties where we did not originate or\ntransfer the loans but serve as master\nservicer and invest in securities that could\nbe potentially significant to the VIE.\nConforming loan securitization and\nresecuritization transactions involving the\nGSEs and GNMA are excluded from Table 8.4\nbecause we are not the sponsor or we do not\nhave power over the activities most\nsignificant to the VIEs. Additionally, due to\nthe nature of the guarantees provided by the\nGSEs and the FHA and VA, our credit risk\nassociated with these VIEs is limited. For\nadditional information about conforming\nmortgage loan securitizations and\nresecuritizations, see the \u201cLoan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity\u201d and \u201cResecuritization\nActivities\u201d sections within this Note. TAX\nCREDIT STRUCTURES We co-sponsor and make\ninvestments in affordable housing projects\nthat are designed to generate a return\nprimarily through the realization of federal\ntax credits. The projects are typically\nmanaged by project sponsors who have the power\nover the VIE\u2019s assets. In some instances, our\ninvestments in these structures may require\nthat we fund future capital commitments at the\ndiscretion of the project sponsors. COMMERCIAL\nREAL ESTATE LOANS We may transfer purchased\nindustrial development bonds and GSE credit\nenhancements to VIEs in exchange for\nbeneficial interests. We may also acquire such\nbeneficial interests in transactions where we\ndo not act as a transferor. We own all of the\nbeneficial interests and may also service the\nunderlying mortgages that serve as collateral\nto the bonds. OTHER VIE STRUCTURES We engage\nin various forms of structured finance\narrangements with other VIEs, including asset-\nbacked finance structures and other\nsecuritizations collateralized by asset\nclasses other than mortgages. Collateral may\ninclude rental properties, asset-backed\nsecurities, student loans and mortgage loans.\nWe may participate in structuring or marketing\nthe arrangements, as well as provide\nfinancing, service one or more of the\nunderlying assets, or enter into derivatives\nwith the VIEs. We may also receive fees for\nthose services. We are not the primary\nbeneficiary of these structures because we do\nnot have power to direct the most significant\nactivities of the VIEs.\n                               \n  94    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 8.4 provides a summary of our exposure\nto the unconsolidated VIEs described above,\nwhich includes investments in securities,\nloans, guarantees, liquidity agreements,\ncommitments and certain derivatives. We\nexclude certain transactions with\nunconsolidated VIEs when our continuing\ninvolvement is temporary or administrative in\nnature or insignificant in size. In Table 8.4,\n\u201cTotal VIE assets\u201d represents the remaining\nprincipal balance of assets held by\nunconsolidated VIEs using the most current\ninformation available. \u201cCarrying value\u201d is the\namount in our consolidated balance sheet\nrelated to our involvement with the\nunconsolidated VIEs. \u201cMaximum exposure to\nloss\u201d is determined as the carrying value of\nour investment in the VIEs excluding the\nunconditional repurchase options that have not\nbeen exercised, plus the remaining undrawn\nliquidity and lending commitments, the\nnotional amount of net written derivative\ncontracts, and generally the notional amount\nof, or stressed loss estimate for, other\ncommitments and guarantees. Debt, guarantees\nand other commitments include amounts related\nto loans sold that we may be required to\nrepurchase, or otherwise indemnify or\nreimburse the investor or insurer for losses\nincurred, due to material breach of\ncontractual representations and warranties as\nwell as other retained recourse arrangements.\nThe maximum exposure to loss for material\nbreach of contractual representations and\nwarranties represents a stressed case estimate\nwe utilize for determining stressed case\nregulatory capital needs and is considered to\nbe a remote scenario. \u201cMaximum exposure to\nloss\u201d represents estimated loss that would be\nincurred under severe, hypothetical\ncircumstances, for which we believe the\npossibility is extremely remote, such as where\nthe value of our interests and any associated\ncollateral declines to zero, without any\nconsideration of recovery or offset from any\neconomic hedges. Accordingly, this disclosure\nis not an indication of expected loss.\nTable 8.4: Unconsolidated VIEs\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Includes $ 336million and $ 352million of\nsecurities classified as trading at March 31,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\n(2) All other assets includes mortgage\nservicing rights, derivative assets, and other\nassets (predominantly servicing advances).\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    95  \n                               \nNote 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities (continued)\n\nConsolidated VIEs We consolidate VIEs where we\nare the primary beneficiary. We are the\nprimary beneficiary of the following structure\ntypes: COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND\nLEASES We securitize dealer floor plan loans\nand leases in a revolving master trust entity\nand hold the subordinated notes and residual\nequity interests. As servicer and residual\ninterest holder, we control the key decisions\nof the trust and consolidate the entity. The\ntotal VIE assets held by the master trust\nrepresent a majority of the total VIE assets\npresented for this category in Table 8.5. In a\nseparate transaction structure, we also\nprovide the majority of debt and equity\nfinancing to an SPE that engages in lending\nand leasing to specific vendors and service\nthe underlying collateral. OTHER VIE\nSTRUCTURES Other VIEs are primarily related to\nmunicipal tender option bond (MTOB)\ntransactions and nonconforming mortgage loan\nsecuritizations that we sponsor. MTOBs are\nvehicles to finance the purchase of municipal\nbonds through the issuance of short-term debt\nto investors. Our involvement with MTOBs\nincludes serving as the residual interest\nholder, which provides control over the key\ndecisions of the VIE, as well as the\nremarketing agent or liquidity provider\nrelated to the debt issued to investors. We\nalso securitize nonconforming mortgage loans,\nin which our involvement includes servicer of\nthe underlying assets and holder of\nsubordinate or senior securities issued by the\nVIE. Table 8.5 presents a summary of financial\nassets and liabilities of our consolidated\nVIEs. The carrying value represents assets and\nliabilities recorded on our consolidated\nbalance sheet. Carrying values of assets are\npresented using GAAP measurement methods,\nwhich may include fair value, credit\nimpairment or other adjustments, and therefore\nin some instances will differ from \u201cTotal VIE\nassets.\u201d On our consolidated balance sheet, we\nseparately disclose (1) the consolidated\nassets of certain VIEs that can only be used\nto settle the liabilities of those VIEs, and\n(2) the consolidated liabilities of certain\nVIEs for which the VIE creditors do not have\nrecourse to Wells Fargo.\n\nTable 8.5: Transactions with Consolidated VIEs\n                                              \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2013                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n             \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      3      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      3      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) All other assets includes cash and due\nfrom banks, interest-earning deposits with\nbanks, derivative assets, equity securities,\nand other assets.\n\n(2) All other liabilities includes short-term\nborrowings, derivative liabilities, and\naccrued expenses and other liabilities.\n                                              \n  Other Transactions                          \n                                              \nIn addition to the\ntransactions included\nin the previous\ntables, we have used\nwholly-owned trust\npreferred security\nVIEs to issue debt\nsecurities or\npreferred equity\nexclusively to third-\nparty investors.

The credit risk related to these\nadvances is limited since the reimbursement is\ngenerally senior to cash payments to\ninvestors. We also advance payments of taxes\nand insurance for our owned loans which are\ncollectible from the borrower. We maintain an\nallowance for uncollectible amounts for\nadvances on loans serviced for others that may\nnot be reimbursed if the payments were not\nmade in accordance with applicable servicing\nagreements or if the insurance or servicing\nagreements contain limitations on\nreimbursements. Servicing advances on owned\nloans are charged-off when deemed\nuncollectible.

Estimated\nmaximum exposure to loss was $ 218million and\n$ 216million with related collateral of $\n2.2billion and $ 2.3billion as of March 31,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\n\u201cMaximum exposure to loss\u201d and \u201cNon-investment\ngrade\u201d are required disclosures under GAAP.\nMaximum exposure to loss represents the\nestimated loss that would be incurred under an\nassumed hypothetical circumstance, despite\nwhat we believe is a remote possibility, where\nthe value of our interests and any associated\ncollateral declines to zero. Maximum exposure\nto loss estimates in Table 11.1 do not reflect\neconomic hedges or collateral we could use to\noffset or recover losses we may incur under\nour guarantee agreements. Accordingly, this\nrequired disclosure is not an indication of\nexpected loss. We believe the carrying value\nis more representative of our exposure to loss\nthan maximum exposure to loss. The carrying\nvalue represents the fair value of the\nguarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL\nfor guarantees, if applicable. In determining\nthe ACL for guarantees, we consider the credit\nrisk of the related contingent obligation.\nNon-investment grade represents those\nguarantees on which we have a higher risk of\nperformance under the terms of the guarantee.\nIf the underlying assets under the guarantee\nare non-investment grade (that is, an external\nrating that is below investment grade or an\ninternal credit default grade that is\nequivalent to a below investment grade\nexternal rating), we consider the risk of\nperformance to be high. Internal credit\ndefault grades are determined based upon the\nsame credit policies that we use to evaluate\nthe risk of payment or performance when making\nloans and other extensions of credit. Credit\nquality indicators we usually consider in\nevaluating risk of payments or performance are\ndescribed in Note 4 (Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit Losses). We provide debit\nand credit card transaction processing\nservices through payment networks directly for\nmerchants and as a sponsor for merchant\nprocessing servicers, including our joint\nventure with a third party that is accounted\nfor as an equity method investment. In our\nrole as the merchant acquiring bank, we have a\npotential obligation in connection with\npayment and delivery disputes between the\nmerchant and the cardholder that are resolved\nin favor of the cardholder, referred to as a\ncharge-back transaction. We estimate our\npotential maximum exposure to be the total\nmerchant transaction volume processed in the\npreceding four months, which is generally the\nlifecycle for a charge-back transaction. As of\nMarch 31, 2022, our potential maximum exposure\nwas approximately $ 748.8billion, and related\nlosses, including those from our joint venture\nentity, were insignificant. The Parent fully\nand unconditionally guarantees the payment of\nprincipal, interest, and any other amounts\nthat may be due on securities that its 100%\nowned finance subsidiary, Wells Fargo Finance\nLLC, may issue.These securities are not\nguaranteed by any other subsidiary of the\nParent. The guaranteed liabilities were $\n1.1billion and $ 1.2billion at March 31, 2022\nand December 31, 2021, respectively. These\nguarantees rank on parity with all of the\nParent\u2019s other unsecured and unsubordinated\nindebtedness.\n                                \n  100    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nOTHER COMMITMENTS To\nmeet the financing\nneeds of our\ncustomers, we may\nenter into commitments\nto purchase debt and\nequity securities to\nprovide capital for\ntheir funding,\nliquidity or other\nfuture needs. As of\nboth March 31, 2022\nand December 31, 2021,\nwe had commitments to\npurchase debt\nsecurities of $\n18million and\ncommitments to\npurchase equity\nsecurities of $\n2.3billion and $\n2.4billion,\nrespectively. As part\nof maintaining our\nmemberships in certain\nclearing\norganizations, we are\nrequired to stand\nready to provide\nliquidity to sustain\nmarket clearing\nactivity in the event\nunforeseen events\noccur or are deemed\nlikely to occur.\nCertain of these\nobligations are\nguarantees of other\nmembers\u2019 performance\nand accordingly are\nincluded in Table 11.1\nin Other guarantees\nand indemnifications.\nAlso, we have\ncommitments to\npurchase loans and\nsecurities under\nresale agreements from\ncertain\ncounterparties,\nincluding central\nclearing\norganizations. The\namount of our unfunded\ncontractual\ncommitments was $\n13.2billion and $\n11.0billion as of\nMarch 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021,\nrespectively. Given\nthe nature of these\ncommitments, they are\nexcluded from Table\n4.4 (Unfunded Credit\nCommitments) in Note 4\n(Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses).\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    101  \n                                \n                                         \n  Note 12:Pledged Assets and Collateral  \n                                         \nPledged Assets Table 12.1 provides the\ncarrying amount of on-balance sheet pledged\nassets and the fair value of other pledged\ncollateral. Other pledged collateral is\ncollateral we have received from third\nparties, have the right to repledge and is not\nrecognized on our consolidated balance sheet.\nTRADING RELATED ACTIVITY Our trading\nbusinesses may pledge debt and equity\nsecurities in connection with securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase (repurchase\nagreements) and securities lending\narrangements. The collateral that we pledge\nrelated to our trading activities may include\nour own collateral as well as collateral that\nwe have received from third parties and have\nthe right to repledge. All of the collateral\nwe pledge related to trading activity is\neligible to be repledged or sold by the\nsecured party. NON-TRADING RELATED ACTIVITY As\npart of our liquidity management strategy, we\nmay pledge loans, debt securities, and other\nfinancial assets to secure trust and public\ndeposits, borrowings and letters of credit\nfrom the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (FRB) and for other purposes as\nrequired or permitted by law or insurance\nstatutory requirements. Substantially all of\nthe non-trading activity pledged collateral is\nnot eligible to be repledged or sold by the\nsecured party. VIE RELATED We pledge assets in\nconnection with various types of transactions\nentered into with VIEs. These pledged assets\ncan only be used to settle the liabilities of\nthose entities. We also have loans recorded on\nour consolidated balance sheet which represent\ncertain delinquent loans that are eligible for\nrepurchase from GNMA loan securitizations.

These activities are\nconducted through our broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, through\nother bank entities. Our securities financing\nactivities primarily involve high-quality,\nliquid securities such as U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and government agency securities\nand, to a lesser extent, less liquid\nsecurities, including equity securities,\ncorporate bonds and asset-backed securities.\nWe account for these transactions as\ncollateralized financings in which we\ntypically receive or pledge securities as\ncollateral. We believe these financing\ntransactions generally do not have material\ncredit risk given the collateral provided and\nthe related monitoring processes. OFFSETTING\nOF SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES Table 12.2\npresents resale and repurchase agreements\nsubject to master repurchase agreements (MRA)\nand securities borrowing and lending\nagreements subject to master securities\nlending agreements (MSLA). Collateralized\nfinancings, and those with a single\ncounterparty, are presented net on our\nconsolidated balance sheet, provided certain\ncriteria are met that permit balance sheet\nnetting. The majority of transactions subject\nto these agreements do not meet those criteria\nand thus are not eligible for balance sheet\nnetting. Collateral we pledged consists of\nnon-cash instruments, such as securities or\nloans, and is not netted on the consolidated\nbalance sheet against the related liability.\nCollateral we received includes securities or\nloans and is not recognized on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. Collateral pledged\nor received may be increased or decreased over\ntime to maintain certain contractual\nthresholds, as the assets underlying each\narrangement fluctuate in value. Generally,\nthese agreements require collateral to exceed\nthe asset or liability recognized on\n                                \n  102    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nthe balance sheet. The following table\nincludes the amount of collateral pledged or\nreceived related to exposures subject to\nenforceable MRAs or MSLAs. While these\nagreements are typically over-collateralized,\nU.S. GAAP requires disclosure in this table to\nlimit the reported amount of such collateral\nto the amount of the related recognized asset\nor liability for each counterparty. In\naddition to the amounts included in Table\n12.2, we also have balance sheet netting\nrelated to derivatives that is disclosed in\nNote 14 (Derivatives).\n\nTable 12.2: Offsetting \u2013 Securities Financing\nActivities\n                                              \n                     Mar              Dec     \n  (in                31,              31,     \n  mill\u2026              2022             2021    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Asse\u2026                                       \n  Resa\u2026                                       \n  and                                         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  borr\u2026                                       \n  agre\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026    $  105,\u2026            103,\u2026          \n  reco\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  offs\u2026                                       \n  in          -14,\u2026            -14,\u2026          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (1)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  in                                          \n  cons\u2026       90,6\u2026            89,0\u2026          \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (2)                                         \n  Coll\u2026                                       \n  not                                         \n  reco\u2026                                       \n  in          -89,\u2026            -88,\u2026          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (3)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026    $    777              736          \n  (4)                                         \n  Liab\u2026                                       \n  Repu\u2026                                       \n  and                                         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  lend\u2026                                       \n  agre\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026    $  34,7\u2026            35,0\u2026          \n  reco\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  offs\u2026                                       \n  in          -14,\u2026            -14,\u2026          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (1)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  in                                          \n  cons\u2026       19,7\u2026            20,9\u2026          \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (5)                                         \n  Coll\u2026                                       \n  pled\u2026                                       \n  but                                         \n  not                                         \n  nett\u2026       -19,\u2026            -20,\u2026          \n  in                                          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (6)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026    $    205              149          \n  (4)                                         \n                                              \n(1) Represents recognized amount of resale and\nrepurchase agreements with counterparties\nsubject to enforceable MRAs that have been\noffset in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n(2) Includes $ 67.7billion and $ 66.2billion\nclassified on our consolidated balance sheet\nin federal funds sold and securities purchased\nunder resale agreements at March 31, 2022, and\nDecember 31, 2021, respectively.

At March 31, 2022, and December\n31, 2021, we have received total collateral\nwith a fair value of $ 128.2billion and $\n124.4billion, respectively, all of which we\nhave the right to sell or repledge. These\namounts include securities we have sold or\nrepledged to others with a fair value of $\n26.3billion and $ 28.8billion at March 31,\n2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively.\n\n(4) Represents the amount of our exposure\n(assets) or obligation (liabilities) that is\nnot collateralized and/or is not subject to an\nenforceable MRA or MSLA.\n\n(5) Amount is classified in short-term\nborrowings on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n(6) Represents the fair value of collateral we\nhave pledged, related to enforceable MRAs or\nMSLAs, limited in the table above to the\namount of the recognized liability owed to\neach counterparty. At March 31, 2022, and\nDecember 31, 2021, we have pledged total\ncollateral with a fair value of $ 35.7billion\nand $ 35.9billion, respectively, substantially\nall of which may be sold or repledged by the\ncounterparty.\n\nREPURCHASE AND SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements\nand securities lending arrangements are\neffectively short-term collateralized\nborrowings. In these transactions, we receive\ncash in exchange for transferring securities\nas collateral and recognize an obligation to\nreacquire the securities for cash at the\ntransaction\u2019s maturity. These types of\ntransactions create risks, including (1) the\ncounterparty may fail to return the securities\nat maturity, (2) the fair value of the\nsecurities transferred may decline below the\namount of our obligation to reacquire the\nsecurities, and therefore create an obligation\nfor us to pledge additional amounts, and (3)\nthe counterparty may accelerate the maturity\non demand, requiring us to reacquire the\nsecurity prior to contractual maturity. We\nattempt to mitigate these risks in various\nways. Our collateral primarily consists of\nhighly liquid securities. In addition, we\nunderwrite and monitor the financial strength\nof our counterparties, monitor the fair value\nof collateral pledged relative to\ncontractually required repurchase amounts, and\nmonitor that our collateral is properly\nreturned through the clearing and settlement\nprocess in advance of our cash repayment.\nTable 12.3 provides the gross amounts\nrecognized on the consolidated balance sheet\n(before the effects of offsetting) of our\nliabilities for repurchase and securities\nlending agreements disaggregated by underlying\ncollateral type.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    103  \n                                \nNote 12: Pledged Assets and Collateral\n(continued)\n\nTable 12.3: Gross Obligations by Underlying\nCollateral Type\n                                              \n                      Mar              Dec    \n  (in                 31,              31,    \n  mill\u2026               2022             2021   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Repu\u2026                                       \n  agre\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  U.S.                                        \n  Trea\u2026    $  16,141           14,956         \n  and                                         \n  fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  U.S.                                        \n  Stat\u2026            1                1         \n  and                                         \n  poli\u2026                                       \n  subd\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026        2,326            3,432         \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Non-\u2026                                       \n  mort\u2026          759              809         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Corp\u2026                                       \n  debt         8,215            8,899         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Asse\u2026          473              358         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Equi\u2026        1,217              919         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Other          241              409         \n  Total       29,373           29,783         \n  repu\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  lend\u2026                                       \n  arra\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  U.S.                                        \n  Trea\u2026          117               33         \n  and                                         \n  fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026           17               17         \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Corp\u2026                                       \n  debt           126               80         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Equi\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026        5,067            5,050         \n  (1)                                         \n  Other           52               80         \n  Total                                       \n  secu\u2026        5,379            5,260         \n  lend\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  repu\u2026                                       \n  and      $  34,752           35,043         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  lend\u2026                                       \n                                              \n(1) Equity securities are generally exchange\ntraded and represent collateral received from\nthird parties that has been repledged.

These proceedings and\ninvestigations include actions brought against\nWells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries with\nrespect to corporate-related matters and\ntransactions in which Wells Fargo and/or our\nsubsidiaries were involved. In addition, Wells\nFargo and our subsidiaries may be requested to\nprovide information to or otherwise cooperate\nwith government authorities in the conduct of\ninvestigations of other persons or industry\ngroups. We establish accruals for legal\nactions when potential losses associated with\nthe actions become probable and the costs can\nbe reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we\nrecord the amount we consider to be the best\nestimate within a range of potential losses\nthat are both probable and estimable; however,\nif we cannot determine a best estimate, then\nwe record the low end of the range of those\npotential losses. There can be no assurance as\nto the ultimate outcome of legal actions,\nincluding the matters described below, and the\nactual costs of resolving legal actions may be\nsubstantially higher or lower than the amounts\naccrued for those actions. ATM ACCESS FEE\nLITIGATION In October 2011, plaintiffs filed a\nputative class action, Mackmin, et al. v.\nVisa, Inc. et al. , against Wells Fargo &\nCompany, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Visa,\nMasterCard, and several other banks in the\nUnited States District Court for the District\nof Columbia. Plaintiffs allege that the Visa\nand MasterCard requirement that if an ATM\noperator charges an access fee on Visa and\nMasterCard transactions, then that fee cannot\nbe greater than the access fee charged for\ntransactions on other networks, violates\nantitrust rules. Plaintiffs seek treble\ndamages, restitution, injunctive relief, and\nattorneys\u2019 fees where available under federal\nand state law. Two other antitrust cases that\nmake similar allegations were filed in the\nsame court, but these cases did not name Wells\nFargo as a defendant. On February 13, 2013,\nthe district court granted defendants\u2019 motions\nto dismiss the threeactions. Plaintiffs\nappealed the dismissals and, on August 4,\n2015, the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe District of Columbia Circuit vacated the\ndistrict court\u2019s decisions and remanded the\nthreecases to the district court for further\nproceedings. On June 28, 2016, the United\nStates Supreme Court granted defendants\u2019\npetitions for writ of certiorari to review the\ndecisions of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia. On\nNovember 17, 2016, the United States Supreme\nCourt dismissed the petitions as improvidently\ngranted, and the threecases returned to the\ndistrict court for further proceedings. In\nNovember 2021, the district court granted\npreliminary approval of an agreement pursuant\nto which the Company will pay $ 20.8million in\norder to resolve the cases. AUTOMOBILE LENDING\nMATTERS On April 20, 2018, the Company entered\ninto consent orders with the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to\nresolve, among other things, investigations by\nthe agencies into the Company\u2019s compliance\nrisk management program and its past practices\ninvolving certain automobile collateral\nprotection insurance (CPI) policies and\ncertain mortgage interest rate lock\nextensions. The consent orders require\nremediation to customers and the payment of a\ntotal of $ 1.0billion in civil money penalties\nto the agencies. In July 2017, the Company\nannounced a plan to remediate customers who\nmay have been financially harmed due to issues\nrelated to automobile CPI policies purchased\nthrough a third-party vendor on their behalf.\nMultiple putative class actions alleging,\namong other things, unfair and deceptive\npractices relating to these CPI policies, were\nfiled against the Company and consolidated\ninto onemulti-district litigation in the\nUnited States District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California. As previously\ndisclosed, the Company entered into a\nsettlement to resolve the multi-district\nlitigation. Shareholders also filed a putative\nsecurities fraud class action against the\nCompany and its executive officers alleging\nmaterial misstatements and omissions of CPI-\nrelated information in the Company\u2019s public\ndisclosures. In January 2020, the court\ndismissed this action as to all defendants\nexcept the Company and a former executive\nofficer and limited the action to two alleged\nmisstatements. In addition, the Company is\nsubject to a class action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Central District of\nCalifornia alleging that customers are\nentitled to refunds related to the unused\nportion of guaranteed automobile protection\n(GAP) waiver or insurance agreements between\nthe customer and dealer and, by assignment,\nthe lender. In November 2021, the court\ngranted final approval of an agreement\npursuant to which the Company agreed to pay $\n45million and make certain changes to its GAP\nrefund practices in order to settle the\naction. Allegations related to the CPI and GAP\nprograms were among the subjects of a\nshareholder derivative lawsuit in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California, which has been\ndismissed. In addition, federal and state\ngovernment agencies, including the CFPB, have\nundertaken formal or informal inquiries,\ninvestigations, or examinations regarding\nthese and other issues related to the\norigination, servicing, and collection of\nconsumer auto loans, including related\ninsurance products. As previously disclosed,\nthe Company entered into an agreement to\nresolve investigations by state attorneys\ngeneral. COMMERCIAL LENDING SHAREHOLDER\nLITIGATION In October and November 2020,\nplaintiffs filed two putative securities fraud\nclass actions, which were consolidated into\nonelawsuit pending in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia alleging that the Company and\ncertain of its current and former officers\nmade false and misleading statements or\nomissions regarding, among other things, the\nCompany\u2019s commercial lending underwriting\npractices, the credit quality of its\ncommercial credit portfolios, and the value of\nits commercial loans, collateralized loan\nobligations and commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities. COMPANY 401(K) PLAN REGULATORY\nINVESTIGATIONS Federal government agencies,\nincluding the United States Department of\nLabor, are reviewing certain transactions\nassociated with the Employee Stock Ownership\nPlan feature of the Company\u2019s 401(k) plan,\nincluding the manner in which the 401(k) plan\npurchased certain securities used in\nconnection with the Company\u2019s contributions to\nthe 401(k) plan. The Company is in resolution\ndiscussions with the Department of Labor,\nalthough there can be no assurance as to the\noutcome of these discussions.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    105  \n                                \n                                              \n  Note 13:Legal Actions(continued)            \n                                              \nCONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION Wells\nFargo shareholders have brought a putative\nsecurities fraud class action in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York alleging that the Company\nand certain of its current and former\nexecutive officers and directors made false or\nmisleading statements regarding the Company\u2019s\nefforts to comply with the February 2018\nconsent order with the Federal Reserve Board\nand the April 2018 consent orders with the\nCFPB and OCC. Allegations related to the\nCompany\u2019s efforts to comply with these three\nconsent orders were also among the subjects of\na shareholder derivative lawsuit filed in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California. On February 4, 2022,\nthe district court granted the Company's\nmotion to dismiss the shareholder derivative\nlawsuit. On April 19, 2022, shareholders filed\na new derivative lawsuit in California state\ncourt making similar allegations. CONSUMER\nDEPOSIT ACCOUNT RELATED REGULATORY\nINVESTIGATIONS The CFPB is conducting an\ninvestigation into whether customers were\nunduly harmed by the Company\u2019s historical\npractices associated with the freezing (and,\nin many cases, closing) of consumer deposit\naccounts after the Company detected suspected\nfraudulent activity (by third parties or\naccount holders) that affected those accounts.\nThe CFPB is also investigating certain of the\nCompany\u2019s past disclosures to customers\nregarding the minimum qualifying debit card\nusage required for customers to receive a\nwaiver of monthly service fees on certain\nconsumer deposit accounts. INTERCHANGE\nLITIGATION Plaintiffs representing a class of\nmerchants have filed putative class actions,\nand individual merchants have filed individual\nactions, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells\nFargo & Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and\nWachovia Corporation regarding the interchange\nfees associated with Visa and MasterCard\npayment card transactions. Visa, MasterCard,\nand several other banks and bank holding\ncompanies are also named as defendants in\nthese actions. These actions have been\nconsolidated in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of New York.\nThe amended and consolidated complaint asserts\nclaims against defendants based on alleged\nviolations of federal and state antitrust laws\nand seeks damages, as well as injunctive\nrelief. Plaintiff merchants allege that Visa,\nMasterCard, and payment card issuing banks\nunlawfully colluded to set interchange rates.\nPlaintiffs also allege that enforcement of\ncertain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged\ntying and bundling of services offered to\nmerchants are anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and\nWachovia, along with other defendants and\nentities, are parties to Loss and Judgment\nSharing Agreements, which provide that they,\nalong with other entities, will share, based\non a formula, in any losses from the\nInterchange Litigation. On July 13, 2012,\nVisa, MasterCard, and the financial\ninstitution defendants, including Wells Fargo,\nsigned a memorandum of understanding with\nplaintiff merchants to resolve the\nconsolidated class action and reached a\nseparate settlement in principle of the\nconsolidated individual actions. The\nsettlement payments to be made by all\ndefendants in the consolidated class and\nindividual actions totaled approximately $\n6.6billion before reductions applicable to\ncertain merchants opting out of the\nsettlement. The class settlement also provided\nfor the distribution to class merchants of 10\nbasis points of default interchange across all\ncredit rate categories for a period of eight\nconsecutive months. The district court granted\nfinal approval of the settlement, which was\nappealed to the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit by settlement objector\nmerchants. Other merchants opted out of the\nsettlement and are pursuing several individual\nactions. On June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit\nvacated the settlement agreement and reversed\nand remanded the consolidated action to the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York for further proceedings.\nOn November 23, 2016, prior class counsel\nfiled a petition to the United States Supreme\nCourt, seeking review of the reversal of the\nsettlement by the Second Circuit, and the\nSupreme Court denied the petition on March 27,\n2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court\nappointed lead class counsel for a damages\nclass and an equitable relief class. The\nparties have entered into a settlement\nagreement to resolve the money damages class\nclaims pursuant to which defendants will pay a\ntotal of approximately $ 6.2billion, which\nincludes approximately $ 5.3billion of funds\nremaining from the 2012 settlement and $\n900million in additional funding. The\nCompany\u2019s allocated responsibility for the\nadditional funding is approximately $\n94.5million. The court granted final approval\nof the settlement on December 13, 2019, which\nwas appealed to the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit by settlement\nobjector merchants. On September 27, 2021, the\ndistrict court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion\nfor class certification in the equitable\nrelief case. Several of the opt-out and direct\naction litigations have been settled while\nothers remain pending. MORTGAGE LENDING\nMATTERS Plaintiffs representing a class of\nmortgage borrowers filed separate putative\nclass actions, Hernandez v. Wells Fargo, et\nal. , Coordes v. Wells Fargo, et al. , Ryder\nv. Wells Fargo , Liguori v. Wells Fargo , and\nDore v. Wells Fargo , against Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A., in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of California,\nthe United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Washington, the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of\nOhio, the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York, and the United\nStates District Court for the Western District\nof Pennsylvania, respectively. Plaintiffs\nalleged that Wells Fargo improperly denied\nmortgage loan modifications or repayment plans\nto customers in the foreclosure process due to\nthe overstatement of foreclosure attorneys\u2019\nfees that were included for purposes of\ndetermining whether a customer in the\nforeclosure process qualified for a mortgage\nloan modification or repayment plan. The\nCompany entered into agreements to settle the\nHernandez case in two phases, an initial $\n18.5million class settlement that was approved\nby the district court in October 2020 and an\nadditional $ 22million class settlement that\nwas approved by the district court in January\n2022 in order to include additional borrowers\nwho should have been included in the initial\nsettlement class. In addition, the Company\nentered into an agreement in the Ryder case\npursuant to which the Company paid $ 12million\nto cover other impacted borrowers who were not\nincluded in the Hernandez case, which was\napproved by the district court in January\n2022. The Dore, Coordes, and Liguori cases\nhave been voluntarily dismissed. In addition,\nfederal and state government agencies,\nincluding the CFPB, have undertaken formal or\ninformal inquiries or investigations regarding\nthese and other mortgage servicing matters. On\nSeptember 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a $\n250million civil money penalty against the\nCompany regarding loss mitigation activities\nin the Company\u2019s Home Lending business and\ninsufficient progress in addressing\nrequirements under the OCC\u2019s April 2018\nconsent order. In addition, on September 9,\n2021, the Company entered into a consent order\nwith the OCC requiring the Company to improve\nthe execution, risk management, and oversight\nof loss mitigation activities in its Home\nLending business.\n                                \n  106    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nNOMURA/NATIXIS\nMORTGAGE-RELATED\nLITIGATION In August\n2014 and August 2015,\nNomura Credit &\nCapital Inc. (Nomura)\nand Natixis Real\nEstate Holdings, LLC\n(Natixis) filed a\ntotal of seventhird-\nparty complaints\nagainst Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A., in New\nYork state court. In\nthe underlying first-\nparty actions, Nomura\nand Natixis have been\nsued for alleged\nbreaches of\nrepresentations and\nwarranties made in\nconnection with\nresidential mortgage-\nbacked securities\nsponsored by them. In\nthe third-party\nactions, Nomura and\nNatixis allege that\nWells Fargo, as master\nservicer, primary\nservicer or securities\nadministrator, failed\nto notify Nomura and\nNatixis of their own\nbreaches, failed to\nproperly oversee the\nprimary servicers, and\nfailed to adhere to\naccepted servicing\npractices. Natixis\nadditionally alleges\nthat Wells Fargo\nfailed to perform\ndefault oversight\nduties. In March 2022,\nWells Fargo entered\ninto an agreement to\nsettle the six actions\nfiled by Nomura, and\nthe actions have been\nvoluntarily dismissed.\nIn the remaining\naction filed by\nNatixis, Wells Fargo\nhas asserted\ncounterclaims alleging\nthat Natixis failed to\nprovide Wells Fargo\nnotice of its\nrepresentation and\nwarranty breaches.\nOFAC RELATED\nINVESTIGATION The\nCompany has self-\nidentified an issue\nwhereby certain\nforeign banks utilized\na Wells Fargo\nsoftware-based\nsolution to conduct\nimport/export trade-\nrelated financing\ntransactions with\ncountries and entities\nprohibited by the\nOffice of Foreign\nAssets Control (OFAC)\nof the United States\nDepartment of the\nTreasury. We do not\nbelieve any funds\nrelated to these\ntransactions flowed\nthrough accounts at\nWells Fargo as a\nresult of the\naforementioned\nconduct. The Company\nhas made voluntary\nself-disclosures to\nOFAC and has been\ncooperating with\ninvestigations or\ninquiries arising out\nof this matter by\nfederal government\nagencies. The Company\nis in resolution\ndiscussions with\ncertain of these\nagencies, although\nthere can be no\nassurance as to the\noutcome of these\ndiscussions. RETAIL\nSALES PRACTICES\nMATTERS Federal and\nstate government\nagencies, including\nthe United States\nDepartment of Justice\n(Department of\nJustice) and the\nUnited States\nSecurities and\nExchange Commission\n(SEC), have undertaken\nformal or informal\ninquiries or\ninvestigations arising\nout of certain retail\nsales practices of the\nCompany that were the\nsubject of settlements\nwith the CFPB, the\nOCC, and the Office of\nthe Los Angeles City\nAttorney announced by\nthe Company on\nSeptember 8, 2016. On\nFebruary 21, 2020, the\nCompany entered into\nan agreement with the\nDepartment of Justice\nto resolve the\nDepartment of\nJustice\u2019s criminal\ninvestigation into the\nCompany\u2019s retail sales\npractices, as well as\na separate agreement\nto resolve the\nDepartment of\nJustice\u2019s civil\ninvestigation. As part\nof the Department of\nJustice criminal\nsettlement, no charges\nwill be filed against\nthe Company provided\nthe Company abides by\nall the terms of the\nagreement. The\nDepartment of Justice\ncriminal settlement\nalso includes the\nCompany\u2019s agreement\nthat the facts set\nforth in the\nsettlement document\nconstitute sufficient\nfacts for the finding\nof criminal violations\nof statutes regarding\nbank records and\npersonal\ninformation.On\nFebruary 21, 2020, the\nCompany also entered\ninto an order to\nresolve the SEC\u2019s\ninvestigation arising\nout of the Company\u2019s\nretail sales\npractices. The SEC\norder contains a\nfinding, to which the\nCompany consented,\nthat the facts set\nforth include\nviolations of Section\n10(b) of the\nSecurities Exchange\nAct of 1934 and Rule\n10b-5 thereunder.As\npart of the resolution\nof the Department of\nJustice and SEC\ninvestigations, the\nCompany made payments\ntotaling $ 3.0billion.\nThe Company has also\nentered into\nagreements to resolve\nother government\nagency investigations,\nincluding\ninvestigations by the\nstate attorneys\ngeneral. In addition,\na number of lawsuits\nwere filed by\n\nnon-governmental\nparties seeking\ndamages or other\nremedies related to\nthese retail sales\npractices. As\npreviously disclosed,\nthe Company entered\ninto various\nsettlements to resolve\nthese lawsuits. RMBS\nTRUSTEE LITIGATION In\nDecember 2014, Phoenix\nLight SF Limited and\ncertain related\nentities filed a\ncomplaint in the\nUnited States District\nCourt for the Southern\nDistrict of New York\nalleging claims\nagainst Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A., in its\ncapacity as trustee\nfor a number of\nresidential mortgage-\nbacked securities\n(RMBS) trusts.\nComplaints raising\nsimilar allegations\nhave been filed by\nCommerzbank AG in the\nSouthern District of\nNew York and by IKB\nInternational and IKB\nDeutsche Industriebank\nin New York state\ncourt. In each case,\nthe plaintiffs allege\nthat Wells Fargo Bank,\nN.A., as trustee,\ncaused losses to\ninvestors, and\nplaintiffs assert\ncauses of action based\nupon, among other\nthings, the trustee\u2019s\nalleged failure to\nnotify and enforce\nrepurchase obligations\nof mortgage loan\nsellers for purported\nbreaches of\nrepresentations and\nwarranties, notify\ninvestors of alleged\nevents of default, and\nabide by appropriate\nstandards of care\nfollowing alleged\nevents of default. The\nCompany previously\nsettled twoclass\nactions filed by\ninstitutional\ninvestors and an\naction filed by the\nNational Credit Union\nAdministration with\nsimilar allegations.\nIn addition, Park\nRoyal I LLC and Park\nRoyal II LLC have\nfiled complaints that\nwere consolidated in\nNew York state court\nalleging Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A., as\ntrustee, failed to\ntake appropriate\nactions upon learning\nof defective mortgage\nloan documentation.\nSEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE\nLITIGATION The\nSeminole Tribe of\nFlorida filed a\ncomplaint in Florida\nstate court alleging\nthat Wells Fargo, as\ntrustee, charged\nexcess fees in\nconnection with the\nadministration of a\nminor\u2019s trust and\nfailed to invest the\nassets of the trust\nprudently. The\ncomplaint was later\namended to include\nthreeindividual\ncurrent and former\nbeneficiaries as\nplaintiffs and to\nremove the Tribe as a\nparty to the case.\nWells Fargo filed a\npetition to remove the\ncase to federal court.\nOUTLOOK As described\nabove, the Company\nestablishes accruals\nfor legal actions when\npotential losses\nassociated with the\nactions become\nprobable and the costs\ncan be reasonably\nestimated. The high\nend of the range of\nreasonably possible\npotential losses in\nexcess of the\nCompany\u2019s accrual for\nprobable and estimable\nlosses was\napproximately $\n2.8billion as of March\n31, 2022. The outcomes\nof legal actions are\nunpredictable and\nsubject to significant\nuncertainties, and it\nis inherently\ndifficult to determine\nwhether any loss is\nprobable or even\npossible. It is also\ninherently difficult\nto estimate the amount\nof any loss and there\nmay be matters for\nwhich a loss is\nprobable or reasonably\npossible but not\ncurrently estimable.\nAccordingly, actual\nlosses may be in\nexcess of the\nestablished accrual or\nthe range of\nreasonably possible\nloss. Based on\ninformation currently\navailable, advice of\ncounsel, available\ninsurance coverage,\nand established\nreserves, Wells Fargo\nbelieves that the\neventual outcome of\nthe actions against\nWells Fargo and/or its\nsubsidiaries will not,\nindividually or in the\naggregate, have a\nmaterial adverse\neffect on Wells\nFargo\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial condition.\nHowever, it is\npossible that the\nultimate resolution of\na matter, if\nunfavorable, may be\nmaterial to Wells\nFargo\u2019s results of\noperations for any\nparticular period.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    107  \n                                \n                       \n  Note 14:Derivatives  \n                       \nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to\nmarket risk, including interest rate risk,\ncredit risk and foreign currency risk, and to\nassist customers with their risk management\nobjectives. We designate certain derivatives\nas hedging instruments in qualifying hedge\naccounting relationships (fair value or cash\nflow hedges). Our remaining derivatives\nconsist of economic hedges that do not qualify\nfor hedge accounting and derivatives held for\ncustomer accommodation trading or other\npurposes.

Table\n14.1 presents the total notional or\ncontractual amounts and fair values for our\nderivatives.

In\naddition, we use interest rate swaps, cross-\ncurrency swaps, cross-currency interest rate\nswaps and forward contracts to hedge against\nchanges in fair value of certain investments\nin available-for-sale debt securities due to\nchanges in interest rates, foreign currency\nrates, or both. For certain fair value hedges\nof foreign currency risk, changes in fair\nvalue of cross-currency swaps attributable to\nchanges in cross-currency basis spreads are\nexcluded from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and recorded in other\ncomprehensive income. See Note 21 (Other\nComprehensive Income) for the amounts\nrecognized in other comprehensive income. For\ncash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps\nto hedge the variability in interest payments\nreceived on certain interest-earning deposits\nwith banks and certain floating-rate\ncommercial loans, and interest paid on certain\nfloating-rate debt due to changes in the\ncontractually specified interest rate. We also\nuse cross-currency swaps to hedge variability\nin interest payments on fixed-rate foreign\ncurrency-denominated long-term debt due to\nchanges in foreign exchange rates. We estimate\n$ 17million pre-tax of deferred net losses\nrelated to cash flow hedges in OCI at March\n31, 2022, will be reclassified into net\ninterest income during the next twelve months.\nThe deferred losses expected to be\nreclassified into net interest income are\nprimarily related to discontinued hedges of\nfloating rate loans. For cash flow hedges as\nof March 31, 2022, we are hedging our interest\nrate and foreign currency exposure to the\nvariability of future cash flows for all\nforecasted transactions for a maximum of\n10years.

The\namounts under non-investment grade represent\nthe notional amounts of those credit\nderivatives on which we have a higher risk of\nbeing required to perform under the terms of\nthe credit derivative and are a function of\nthe underlying assets.\n\nWe consider the credit risk to be low if the\nunderlying assets under the credit derivative\nhave an external rating that is investment\ngrade. If an external rating is not available,\nwe classify the credit derivative as non-\ninvestment grade. Our maximum exposure to sold\ncredit derivatives is managed through posted\ncollateral and purchased credit derivatives\nwith identical or similar reference positions\nin order to achieve our desired credit risk\nprofile. The credit risk management is\ndesigned to provide an ability to recover a\nsignificant portion of any amounts that would\nbe paid under sold credit derivatives. Credit-\nRisk Contingent Features Certain of our\nderivative contracts contain provisions\nwhereby if the credit rating of our debt were\nto be downgraded by certain major credit\nrating agencies, the counterparty could demand\nadditional collateral or require termination\nor replacement of derivative instruments in a\nnet liability position.

The Cash Balance Plan was frozen on\nJuly 1, 2009, and nonew benefits accrue after\nthat date. For additional information on our\npension and postretirement plans, including\nplan assumptions, investment strategy and\nasset allocation, projected benefit payments,\nand valuation methodologies used for assets\nmeasured at fair value, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) and Note 21\n(Employee Benefits and Other Expenses) in our\n2021 Form 10-K. We recognize settlement losses\nfor our Cash Balance Plan based on an\nassessment of whether lump sum benefit\npayments will, in aggregate for the year,\nexceed the sum of its annual service and\ninterest cost (threshold). Settlement losses\nof $ 47million were recognized during first\nquarter 2022, representing the pro rata\nportion of the net loss in cumulative other\ncomprehensive income based on the percentage\nreduction in the Cash Balance Plan\u2019s projected\nbenefit obligation attributable to lump sum\nbenefit payments during first quarter 2022.\nThere were nosettlement losses recognized\nduring first quarter 2021. As a result of the\nsettlement losses, we remeasured the Cash\nBalance Plan obligation and plan assets as of\nMarch 31, 2022, and used a discount rate of\n3.65%. In first quarter 2022, the result of\nthe settlement losses and remeasurement was: \u2022\nan increase of $ 10million in the Cash Balance\nPlan asset; and \u2022 an increase of $ 57million\nin other comprehensive income (pre-tax). Table\n18.1 presents the components of net periodic\nbenefit cost. The expected long-term rate of\nreturn on plan assets and interest cost\ndiscount rate in determining net periodic\nbenefit cost for first quarter 2022 were 5.00%\nand 2.47%, respectively. Service cost is\nreported in personnel expense and all other\ncomponents of net periodic benefit cost are\nreported in other noninterest expense on the\nconsolidated statement of income.\nTable 18.1: Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n             \u2014      \u2014      4      \u2014      \u2014    \n             2      2      \u2026      3      3    \n             \u2014      \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n             3      \u2026      \u2026      4      \u2026    \n             \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2014      \u2026    \n             1      \u2014      \u2014      2      \u2014    \n             6      \u2026      \u2026      9      \u2026    \n                                              \nOther Expenses Regulatory Charges and\nAssessments expense, which is included in\nother noninterest expense, was $ 225million in\nfirst quarter 2022, compared with $ 217million\nin the same period a year ago, and primarily\nconsisted of Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) deposit assessment expense.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    125  \n                                \n                                 \n  Note 19:Restructuring Charges  \n                                 \nThe Company began pursuing various initiatives\nto reduce expenses and create a more efficient\nand streamlined organization in third quarter\n2020.

Restructuring charges\nare recorded as a component of noninterest\nexpense on our consolidated statement of\nincome.

All other business\nactivities that are not included in the\nreportable operating segments have been\nincluded in Corporate. We define our\nreportable operating segments by type of\nproduct and customer segment, and their\nresults are based on our management reporting\nprocess. The management reporting process\nmeasures the performance of the reportable\noperating segments based on the Company\u2019s\nmanagement structure, and the results are\nregularly reviewed by our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Operating Committee. The\nmanagement reporting process is based on U.S.\nGAAP and includes specific adjustments, such\nas funds transfer pricing for asset/liability\nmanagement, shared revenues and expenses, and\ntaxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently\nreflect income from taxable and tax-exempt\nsources, which allows management to assess\nperformance consistently across the operating\nsegments.

Basis of\nPresentation FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING Corporate\ntreasury manages a funds transfer pricing\nmethodology that considers interest rate risk,\nliquidity risk, and other product\ncharacteristics. Operating segments pay a\nfunding charge for their assets and receive a\nfunding credit for their deposits, both of\nwhich are included in net interest income. The\nnet impact of the funding charges or credits\nis recognized in corporate treasury. REVENUE\nAND EXPENSE SHARING When lines of business\njointly serve customers, the line of business\nthat is responsible for providing the product\nor service recognizes revenue or expense with\na referral fee paid or an allocation of cost\nto the other line of business based on\nestablished internal revenue-sharing\nagreements. When a line of business uses a\nservice provided by another line of business\nor enterprise function (included in\nCorporate), expense is generally allocated\nbased on the cost and use of the service\nprovided. TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS\nTaxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-\nexempt income on certain loans and debt\nsecurities are included in net interest\nincome, while taxable-equivalent adjustments\nrelated to income tax credits for low-income\nhousing and renewable energy investments are\nincluded in noninterest income, in each case\nwith corresponding impacts to income tax\nexpense (benefit). Adjustments are included in\nCorporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate\nand Investment Banking and are eliminated to\nreconcile to the Company\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial results.\n                                \n  130    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nTable 22.1 presents our results by operating\nsegment.\nTable 22.1: Operating Segments\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to\ntax-exempt income on certain loans and debt\nsecurities are included in net interest\nincome, while taxable-equivalent adjustments\nrelated to income tax credits for low-income\nhousing and renewable energy investments are\nincluded in noninterest income, in each case\nwith corresponding impacts to income tax\nexpense (benefit).

The\nFRB establishes capital requirements for the\nconsolidated financial holding company, and\nthe OCC has similar requirements for the\nCompany\u2019s national banks, including Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A. (the Bank). Table 23.1\npresents regulatory capital information for\nWells Fargo & Company and the Bank in\naccordance with Basel III capital\nrequirements. We must calculate our risk-based\ncapital ratios under both the Standardized and\nAdvanced Approaches. The Standardized Approach\napplies assigned risk weights to broad risk\ncategories, while the calculation of risk-\nweighted assets (RWAs) under the Advanced\nApproach differs by requiring applicable banks\nto utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which\nrelies upon the use of internal credit models,\nand includes an operational risk component. At\nMarch 31, 2022, the Bank and our other insured\ndepository institutions were considered well-\ncapitalized under the requirements of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act.\nTable 23.1: Regulatory Capital Information\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n* Denotes the binding ratio under the\nStandardized and Advanced Approaches at March\n31, 2022.\n(1) The SLR consists of tier 1 capital divided\nby total leverage exposure. Total leverage\nexposure consists of total average assets,\nless goodwill and other permitted tier 1\ncapital deductions (net of deferred tax\nliabilities), plus certain off-balance sheet\nexposures.\n(2) The tier 1 leverage ratio consists of tier\n1 capital divided by total average assets,\nexcluding goodwill and certain other items as\ndetermined under the rule.\nAt March 31, 2022, the CET1, tier 1 and total\ncapital ratio requirements for the Company\nincluded a global systemically important bank\n(G-SIB) surcharge of 1.50%. The G-SIB\nsurcharge is not applicable to the Bank. In\naddition, the CET1, tier 1 and total capital\nratio requirements for the Company included a\nstress capital buffer of 3.10% under the\nStandardized Approach and a capital\nconservation buffer of 2.50% under the\nAdvanced Approach. The capital ratio\nrequirements for the Bank included a capital\nconservation buffer of 2.50% under both the\nStandardized and Advanced Approaches. The\nCompany is required to maintain these risk-\nbased capital ratios and to maintain an SLR of\nat least 5.00% (composed of a 3.00% minimum\nrequirement plus a supplementary leverage\nbuffer of 2.00%) to avoid restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary bonus\npayments. The Bank is required to maintain an\nSLR of at least 6.00% to be considered well-\ncapitalized under applicable regulatory\ncapital adequacy rules. Capital Planning\nRequirements The FRB\u2019s c apital plan rule\nestablishes capital planning and other\nrequirements that govern capital\ndistributions, including dividends and share\nrepurchases, by certain large bank holding\ncompanies (BHCs), including Wells Fargo. The\nFRB conducts an annual Comprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review exercise and has also\npublished guidance regarding its supervisory\nexpectations for capital planning, including\ncapital policies regarding the process\nrelating to common stock dividend and\nrepurchase decisions in the FRB\u2019s SR Letter\n15-18. The Parent\u2019s ability to make certain\ncapital distributions is subject to the\nrequirements of the capital plan rule and is\nalso subject to the Parent meeting or\nexceeding certain regulatory capital minimums.\n                                \n  132    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nLoan and Dividend\nRestrictions Federal\nlaw restricts the\namount and the terms\nof both credit and\nnon-credit\ntransactions between a\nbank and its nonbank\naffiliates.\nAdditionally, federal\nlaws and regulations\nlimit the dividends\nthat a national bank\nmay pay. Our nonbank\nsubsidiaries are also\nlimited by certain\nfederal and state\nstatutory provisions\nand regulations\ncovering the amount of\ndividends that may be\npaid in any given\nyear.
