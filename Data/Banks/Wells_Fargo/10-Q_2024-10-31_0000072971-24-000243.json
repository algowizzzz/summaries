The methodology of determining\ntangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that\nreturn on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common\nshare, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures\nbecause they enable management, investors, and others to assess the Company\u2019s\nuse of equity.

We provide a diversified set\nof banking, investment and mortgage\nproducts and services, as well as\nconsumer and commercial finance,\nthrough our four reportable operating\nsegments: Consumer Banking and\nLending, Commercial Banking,\nCorporate and Investment Banking, and\nWealth and Investment Management.\nWells Fargo ranked No. 34 on\nFortune\u2019s 2024 rankings of America\u2019s\nlargest corporations. We ranked\nfourth in assets and third in the\nmarket value of our common stock\namong all U.S. banks at September 30,\n2024.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s top priority remains\nbuilding a risk and control\ninfrastructure appropriate for its\nsize and complexity. The Company is\nsubject to a number of consent orders\nand other regulatory actions, some of\nwhich are described below. These\nregulatory actions may require the\nCompany, among other things, to\nundertake certain changes to its\nbusiness, operations, products and\nservices, and risk management\npractices. Addressing these\nregulatory actions is expected to\ntake multiple years, and we are\nlikely to continue to experience\nissues or delays along the way in\nsatisfying their requirements. We are\nalso likely to continue to identify\nmore issues as we implement our risk\nand control infrastructure, which may\nresult in additional regulatory\nactions. Regulators have indicated\nthe potential for escalating\nconsequences for banks that do not\ntimely resolve open issues or have\nrepeat issues. Furthermore, issues or\ndelays with one regulatory action\ncould affect our progress on others.\nFailure to satisfy the requirements\nof a regulatory action on a timely\nbasis could result in additional\nfines, penalties, business\nrestrictions, limitations on\nsubsidiary capital distributions,\nincreased capital or liquidity\nrequirements, enforcement actions,\nand other adverse consequences, which\ncould be significant. While we still\nhave significant work to do and have\nnot yet satisfied certain aspects of\nthese regulatory actions, the Company\nis committed to devoting the\nresources necessary to operate with\nstrong business practices and\ncontrols, maintain the highest level\nof integrity, and have an appropriate\nculture in place.\n\nFederal Reserve Board Consent Order\nRegarding Governance Oversight and\nCompliance and Operational Risk\nManagement\n\nOn February 2, 2018, the Company\nentered into a consent order with the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (FRB). As required by\nthe consent order, the Company\u2019s\nBoard of Directors (Board) submitted\nto the FRB a plan to further enhance\nthe Board\u2019s governance and oversight\nof the Company, and the Company\nsubmitted to the FRB a plan to\nfurther improve the Company\u2019s\ncompliance and operational risk\nmanagement program. The Company\ncontinues to engage with the FRB as\nthe\n\nCompany works to address the consent\norder provisions. The consent order\nalso requires the Company, following\nthe FRB\u2019s acceptance and approval of\nthe plans and the Company\u2019s adoption\nand implementation of the plans, to\ncomplete an initial third-party\nreview of the enhancements and\nimprovements provided for in the\nplans. Until this third-party review\nis complete and the plans are adopted\nand implemented to the satisfaction\nof the FRB, the Company\u2019s total\nconsolidated assets as defined under\nthe consent order will be limited to\nthe level as of December 31, 2017.\nCompliance with this asset cap is\nmeasured on a two-quarter daily\naverage basis to allow for management\nof temporary fluctuations. After\nremoval of the asset cap, a second\nthird-party review must also be\nconducted to assess the efficacy and\nsustainability of the enhancements\nand improvements.\n\nConsent Orders with the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau and\nOffice of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency Regarding Compliance Risk\nManagement Program, Automobile\nCollateral Protection Insurance\nPolicies, and Mortgage Interest Rate\nLock Extensions\n\nOn April 20, 2018, the Company\nentered into consent orders with the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau\n(CFPB) and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (OCC) to\npay an aggregate of $1 billion in\ncivil money penalties to resolve\nmatters regarding the Company\u2019s\ncompliance risk management program\nand past practices involving certain\nautomobile collateral protection\ninsurance policies and certain\nmortgage interest rate lock\nextensions. As required by the\nconsent orders, the Company submitted\nto the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-\nwide compliance risk management plan\nand a plan to enhance the Company\u2019s\ninternal audit program with respect\nto federal consumer financial law and\nthe terms of the consent orders. In\naddition, as required by the consent\norders, the Company submitted for\nnon-objection plans to remediate\ncustomers affected by the automobile\ncollateral protection insurance and\nmortgage interest rate lock matters,\nas well as a plan for the management\nof remediation activities conducted\nby the Company. The Company continues\nto work to address the provisions of\nthe consent orders. On September 9,\n2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million\ncivil money penalty against the\nCompany related to insufficient\nprogress in addressing requirements\nunder the OCC\u2019s April 2018 consent\norder and loss mitigation activities\nin the Company\u2019s Home Lending\nbusiness. On December 20, 2022, the\nCFPB modified its consent order to\nclarify how it would terminate.\n                              \n  Wells Fargo & Company    3  \n                              \n                                                                             \n  Overview(continued)                                                        \n                                                                             \nConsent Order with the OCC Regarding\nLoss Mitigation Activities\n\nOn September 9, 2021, the Company\nentered into a consent order with the\nOCC requiring the Company to improve\nthe execution, risk management, and\noversight of loss mitigation\nactivities in its Home Lending\nbusiness. In addition, the consent\norder restricts the Company from\nacquiring certain third-party\nresidential mortgage servicing and\nlimits transfers of certain mortgage\nloans requiring customer remediation\nout of the Company\u2019s mortgage\nservicing portfolio until remediation\nis provided.\n\nConsent Order with the CFPB Regarding\nAutomobile Lending, Consumer Deposit\nAccounts, and Mortgage Lending\n\nOn December 20, 2022, the Company\nentered into a consent order with the\nCFPB requiring the Company to provide\ncustomer remediation for multiple\nmatters related to automobile\nlending, consumer deposit accounts,\nand mortgage lending; maintain\npractices designed to ensure auto\nlending customers receive refunds for\nthe unused portion of certain\nguaranteed automobile protection\nagreements; comply with certain\nbusiness practice requirements\nrelated to consumer deposit accounts;\nand pay a $1.7 billion civil penalty\nto the CFPB. The required actions\nrelated to many of these matters were\nalready substantially complete at the\ntime we entered into the consent\norder, and the consent order lays out\na path to termination after the\nCompany completes the remainder of\nthe required actions.\n\nFormal Agreement with the OCC\nRegarding Anti-Money Laundering and\nSanctions Risk Management Practices\n\nOn September 12, 2024, the Company\nannounced that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\nentered into a formal agreement with\nthe OCC related to the bank\u2019s anti-\nmoney laundering (AML) and sanctions\nrisk management practices. The\nagreement\u2019s requirements include\nenhancements to AML and sanctions\nrisk management practices, obtaining\nthe OCC\u2019s acceptance of the bank\u2019s\nprogram for assessing the AML and\nsanctions risks of new offerings, and\nthen providing notice to the OCC\nbefore expanding certain of those\nofferings.\n                                                                             \n  Customer Remediation Activities                                            \n                                                                             \nOur work to build a better company\nhas included an effort to identify\nareas or instances where customers\nmay have experienced financial harm,\nprovide remediation as appropriate,\nand implement additional operational\nand control procedures. We are\nworking with our regulatory agencies\nin this effort.\n\nWe have accrued for the probable and\nestimable costs related to our\ncustomer remediation activities,\nwhich amounts may change based on\nadditional facts and information, as\nwell as ongoing reviews and\ncommunications with our regulators.\nWe had $241 million and $819 million\nof accrued liabilities for customer\nremediation activities as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, and December 31,\n2023, respectively. As our ongoing\nreviews continue and as we continue\nto strengthen our risk and control\ninfrastructure, we have identified\nand may in the future identify\nadditional items or areas of\npotential concern. To the extent\nissues are identified, we will\ncontinue to assess any customer harm\nand provide remediation as\nappropriate.\n                                                                             \n  Recent Developments                                                        \n                                                                             \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nSpecial Assessment\n\nIn November 2023, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC)\nfinalized a rule to recover losses to\nthe FDIC deposit insurance fund as a\nresult of bank failures in the first\nhalf of 2023. Under the rule, the\nFDIC will collect a special\nassessment based on an insured\ndepository institution\u2019s estimated\namount of uninsured deposits. Upon\nthe FDIC\u2019s finalization of the rule,\nwe expensed an estimated amount of\nour special assessment of $1.9\nbillion (pre-tax) in fourth quarter\n2023. During 2024, the FDIC provided\nupdates on losses to the deposit\ninsurance fund, which resulted in a\nreversal of expense of $63 million\n(pre-tax) in third quarter 2024 and\nan additional expense of $273 million\n(pre-tax) in the first nine months of\n2024 for the estimated amount of the\nspecial assessment. We expect the\nultimate amount of the special\nassessment may continue to change as\nthe FDIC determines the actual net\nlosses to the deposit insurance fund.\n                                                                             \n  Overdraft Fees Proposal                                                    \n                                                                             \nOn January 17, 2024, the CFPB issued\na proposed rule that would limit\noverdraft fees charged by certain\nbanks. We expect a significant\nreduction to our overdraft fees,\nwhich are included in deposit-related\nfees, if the rule is adopted as\ncurrently proposed.\n                                                                             \n  Debit Card Interchange Fees Proposal                                       \n                                                                             \nOn October 25, 2023, the FRB issued a\nproposed rule that would reduce the\namount of debit card interchange fees\nreceived by debit card issuers. In\naddition, the proposed rule would\nallow for an update to the debit card\ninterchange fee cap every other year\nbased on an analysis of certain costs\nincurred by debit card issuers.

Net income\ndecreased in the first nine months of\n2024, compared with the same period a\nyear ago, predominantly due to a $3.8\nbillion decrease in net interest\nincome and a $922 million increase in\nnoninterest expense, partially offset\nby a $3.6 billion increase in\nnoninterest income.\n                                                                             \n  Net Interest Income                                                        \n                                                                             \nNet interest income and net interest\nmargin decreased in both the third\nquarter and first nine months of\n2024, compared with the same periods\na year ago, driven by the impact of\nhigher interest rates on interest-\nbearing liabilities, including a\ndeposit mix shift to interest-bearing\ndeposits, as well as lower loan\nbalances, partially offset by higher\ninterest rates on interest-earning\nassets.\n\nTable 1 presents the individual\ncomponents of net interest income and\nnet interest margin. Net interest\nincome and net interest margin are\npresented on a taxable-equivalent\nbasis in Table 1 to consistently\nreflect income from taxable and tax-\nexempt loans and debt and equity\nsecurities.

activities related to the\nfurther refinement of the remediation\ncosts for historical mortgage lending\nand other consumer products matters.\nFor additional information on\ncustomer remediation activities, see\nthe \u201cOverview\u201d section above.\n\nAs previously disclosed, we have\noutstanding legal actions and\ncustomer remediation activities that\ncould impact operating losses in the\ncoming quarters.\n\nProfessional and outside services\nexpense decreased driven by\nefficiency initiatives to reduce our\nspending on consultants and\ncontractors.\n\nOther expense increased

All\nother business activities that are\nnot included in the reportable\noperating segments have been included\nin Corporate. For additional\ninformation, see Table 5 below. We\ndefine our reportable operating\nsegments by type of product and\ncustomer segment, and their results\nare based on our management reporting\nprocess. The management reporting\nprocess measures the performance of\nthe reportable operating segments\nbased on the Company\u2019s management\nstructure, and the results are\nregularly reviewed with our Chief\nExecutive Officer and relevant senior\nmanagement. The management reporting\nprocess is based on U.S. GAAP and\nincludes specific adjustments, such\nas funds transfer pricing for\nasset/liability management, shared\nrevenue and expenses, and taxable-\nequivalent adjustments to\nconsistently reflect income from\ntaxable and tax-exempt sources, which\nallows management to assess\nperformance consistently across the\noperating segments.\n\nFunds Transfer Pricing Corporate\ntreasury manages a funds transfer\npricing methodology that considers\ninterest rate risk, liquidity risk,\nand other product characteristics.\nOperating segments pay a funding\ncharge for their assets and receive a\nfunding credit for their deposits,\nboth of which are included in net\ninterest income. The net impact of\nthe funding charges or credits is\nrecognized in corporate treasury.\n\nRevenue and Expense Sharing When\nlines of business jointly serve\ncustomers, the line of business that\nis responsible for providing the\nproduct or service recognizes revenue\nor expense with a referral fee paid\nor an allocation of cost to the other\nline of\n\nbusiness based on established\ninternal revenue-sharing agreements.\n\nWhen a line of business uses a\nservice provided by another line of\nbusiness or enterprise function\n(included in Corporate), expense is\ngenerally allocated based on the cost\nand use of the service provided. We\nperiodically assess and update our\nrevenue and expense allocation\nmethodologies.\n\nTaxable-Equivalent Adjustments\nTaxable-equivalent adjustments\nrelated to tax-exempt income on\ncertain loans and debt securities are\nincluded in net interest income,\nwhile taxable-equivalent adjustments\nrelated to income tax credits for\naffordable housing and renewable\nenergy investments are included in\nnoninterest income, in each case with\ncorresponding impacts to income tax\nexpense (benefit). Adjustments are\nincluded in Corporate, Commercial\nBanking, and Corporate and Investment\nBanking and are eliminated to\nreconcile to the Company\u2019s\nconsolidated financial results.\n\nAllocated Capital Reportable\noperating segments are allocated\ncapital under a risk-sensitive\nframework that is primarily based on\naspects of our regulatory capital\nrequirements, and the assumptions and\nmethodologies used to allocate\ncapital are periodically assessed and\nupdated. Management believes that\nreturn on allocated capital is a\nuseful financial measure because it\nenables management, investors, and\nothers to assess a reportable\noperating segment\u2019s use of capital.\n\nSelected Metrics We present certain\nfinancial and nonfinancial metrics\nthat management uses when evaluating\nreportable operating segment results.\nManagement believes that these\nmetrics are useful to investors and\nothers to assess the performance,\ncustomer growth, and trends of\nreportable operating segments or\nlines of business.\n                                                                             \n   Table 5:                                                                  \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n   Management Reporting Structure                                            \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Wells                                                                      \n  Fargo                                                                      \n  &                                                                          \n  Compa\u2026                                                                     \n            Consum\u2026               Corpor\u2026    Wealth                          \n            Banking    Commer\u2026    and        and        Corpor\u2026              \n            and        Banking    Invest\u2026    Invest\u2026                         \n            Lending               Banking    Manage\u2026                         \n                                                                   \u2022         \n                                                                   Corpora\u2026  \n            \u2022                                                      Treasury  \n            Consum\u2026                                                \u2022         \n            Small                                                  Enterpr\u2026  \n            and        \u2022          \u2022                                Functio\u2026  \n            Busine\u2026    Middle     Banking    \u2022 Wells               \u2022         \n            Banking    Market     \u2022          Fargo                 Investm\u2026  \n            \u2022 Home     Banking    Commer\u2026    Adviso\u2026               Portfol\u2026  \n            Lending    \u2022          Real       \u2022 The                 \u2022         \n            \u2022          Asset-\u2026    Estate     Private               Venture   \n            Credit     Lending    \u2022          Bank                  capital   \n            Card       and        Markets                          and       \n            \u2022 Auto     Leasing                                     private   \n            \u2022                                                      equity    \n            Person\u2026                                                investm\u2026  \n            Lending                                                \u2022         \n                                                                   Non-str\u2026  \n                                                                   busines\u2026  \n                                                                             \n                               \n  12    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 6 and the following discussion\npresent our results by reportable\noperating segment.

Derivatives are recorded\non our consolidated balance sheet at\nfair value, and volume can be\nmeasured in terms of the notional\namount, which is generally not\nexchanged, but is used only as the\nbasis on which interest and other\npayments are determined. The notional\namount is not recorded on our\nconsolidated balance sheet and is\nnot, when viewed in isolation, a\nmeaningful measure of the risk\nprofile of the instruments.

Credit Risk\nManagement Credit risk is the risk of\nloss associated with a borrower or\ncounterparty default (failure to meet\nobligations in accordance with agreed\nupon terms). Credit risk exists with\nmany of the Company\u2019s assets and\nexposures such as debt security\nholdings, certain derivatives, and\nloans. The Board\u2019s Risk Committee has\nprimary oversight responsibility for\ncredit risk.

We employ various credit\nrisk management and monitoring\nactivities to mitigate risks\nassociated with multiple risk factors\naffecting loans we hold including: \u2022\nLoan concentrations and related\ncredit quality; \u2022 Counterparty credit\nrisk; \u2022 Economic and market\nconditions; \u2022 Legislative or\nregulatory mandates; \u2022 Changes in\ninterest rates; \u2022 Merger and\nacquisition activities; and \u2022\nReputation risk.\n\nIn addition, the Company will\ncontinue to integrate climate\nconsiderations into its credit risk\nmanagement activities. Our credit\nrisk management oversight process is\ngoverned centrally, but provides for\ndirect management and accountability\nby our lines of business. Our overall\ncredit process includes comprehensive\ncredit policies, disciplined credit\nunderwriting, frequent and detailed\nrisk measurement and modeling,\nextensive credit training programs,\nand a continual loan review and audit\nprocess. A key to our credit risk\nmanagement is adherence to a well-\ncontrolled underwriting process,\nwhich we believe is appropriate for\nthe needs of our customers as well as\ninvestors who purchase the loans or\nsecurities collateralized by the\nloans.

The following discussion\nprovides additional characteristics\nand analysis of our significant\nportfolios. See Note 5 (Loans and\nRelated Allowance for Credit Losses)\nto Financial Statements in this\nReport for more analysis and credit\nmetric information for each of the\nfollowing portfolios.\n\nCOMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND\nLEASE FINANCING\n\nFor purposes of portfolio risk\nmanagement, we aggregate commercial\nand industrial loans and lease\nfinancing according to market\nsegmentation and standard industry\ncodes. We generally subject\ncommercial and industrial loans and\nlease financing to individual risk\nassessment using our internal\nborrower and collateral quality\nratings. Our ratings are aligned to\nregulatory definitions of pass and\ncriticized categories with criticized\nsegmented among special mention,\nsubstandard, doubtful, and loss\ncategories.\n\nGenerally, the primary source of\nrepayment for our commercial and\nindustrial loans and lease financing\nportfolio is the operating cash flows\nof customers, with the collateral\nsecuring this portfolio representing\na secondary source of repayment.

Loans in California and New\nYork represented approximately 40% of\nthe office property type at both\nSeptember 30, 2024, and December 31,\n2023.\n\nTable 13 provides our CRE loans by\nstate and property type.\n                                                                             \n  Table 13:                                                                  \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  CRE Loans by State and Property Type                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                             \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                 \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                             \n* Less than 1%.\n\n(1) Total commitments consist of loans outstanding plus unfunded credit\ncommitments, excluding issued letters of credit.

We establish exposure\nlimits for each country through a\ncentralized oversight process based\non customer needs, and through\nconsideration of the relevant and\ndistinct risk of each country. We\nmonitor exposures closely and adjust\nour country limits in response to\nchanging conditions. We evaluate our\nindividual country risk exposure\nbased on our assessment of a\nborrower\u2019s ability to repay,\n\nwhich gives consideration for\nallowable transfers of risk, such as\nguarantees and collateral, and may be\ndifferent from the reporting based on\na borrower\u2019s primary address.\n\nOur largest single country exposure\noutside the U.S. at September 30,\n2024, was the United Kingdom, which\ntotaled\n\n$31.2 billion, or approximately 2% of\nour total assets, of which $6.0\nbillion were sovereign exposures and\nincluded deposits we have placed with\nthe Bank of England pursuant to\nregulatory requirements in support of\nour London branch.\n\nTable 14 provides information\nregarding our top 20 exposures by\ncountry (excluding the U.S.), based\non our assessment of risk, which\ngives consideration to the country of\nany guarantors and/or underlying\ncollateral. With respect to Table 14:\n\n\u2022 Lending and deposits with banks\nexposure includes outstanding loans,\nunfunded credit commitments\n(excluding discretionary amounts\nwhere our approval or consent is\nrequired prior to any loan funding or\ncommitment increase), and deposits\nwith non-U.S. banks. These balances\nare presented prior to the deduction\nof the allowance for credit losses or\ncollateral received under the terms\nof the credit agreements, if any.\n\n\u2022 Securities exposure represents debt\nand equity securities of non-U.S.\nissuers. Long and short positions are\nnetted, and net short positions are\nreflected as negative exposure.\n\n\u2022 Derivatives and other exposure\nrepresents foreign exchange\ncontracts, derivative contracts,\nsecurities resale agreements, and\nsecurities lending agreements.\n                                                                             \n  Table 14:

loans with\nadjustable-rate features. We monitor\nthe risk of default as a result of\ninterest rate increases on\nadjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loans,\nwhich may be mitigated by product\nfeatures that limit the amount of the\nincrease in the contractual interest\nrate. The default risk of these loans\nis considered in our ACL for loans.\nARM loans totaled $66.3 billion, or\n7% of total loans, at September 30,\n2024, compared with $66.7 billion, or\n7% of total loans, at December 31,\n2023, with an initial reset date in\n2026 or later for the majority of\nthis portfolio at September 30, 2024.\nWe do not offer option ARM products,\nnor do we offer variable-rate\nmortgage products with fixed payment\namounts, commonly referred to within\nthe financial services industry as\nnegative amortizing mortgage loans.\n\nThe residential mortgage \u2013 junior\nlien portfolio consists of\nresidential mortgage lines of credit\nand loans that are subordinate in\nrights to an existing lien on the\nsame property. These lines and loans\nmay have draw periods, interest-only\npayments, balloon payments,\nadjustable rates and similar\nfeatures. The outstanding balance of\nresidential mortgage lines of credit\nwas $13.1 billion at September 30,\n2024, compared with $15.0 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023. The unfunded\ncredit commitments for these lines of\ncredit totaled $24.2 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared with\n$28.6 billion at December 31, 2023.\nFor additional information on our\nresidential mortgage loan portfolio,\nsee the \u201cRisk Management \u2013 Credit\nRisk Management \u2013 Residential\nMortgage Loans\u201d section in our 2023\nForm 10-K.\n\nWe monitor changes in real estate\nvalues and underlying economic or\nmarket conditions for the geographic\nareas of our\n\nresidential mortgage loan portfolio\nas part of our credit risk management\nprocess.

developing our\nallowance for loan losses. We believe\nexposure to losses on nonaccrual\nloans is mitigated by the following\nfactors at September 30, 2024:\n\n\u2022 98% of total commercial nonaccrual\nloans were secured, predominantly by\nreal estate.\n\n\u2022 62% of total commercial nonaccrual\nloans were current on interest and\n54% of commercial nonaccrual loans\nwere current on both principal and\ninterest, but were on nonaccrual\nstatus because the full or timely\ncollection of interest or principal\nhad become uncertain.\n\n\u2022 99% of total consumer nonaccrual\nloans were secured, of which 96% were\nsecured by real estate and 98% had an\nLTV ratio of 80% or less.\n\n\u2022 $453 million of the $575 million of\nconsumer loans in bankruptcy or\ndischarged in bankruptcy, and\nclassified as nonaccrual, were\ncurrent.\n\nTable 20 provides a summary of\nforeclosed assets and an analysis of\nchanges in foreclosed assets.\n                                                                             \n

same period a year\nago, was primarily due to higher\nlosses in our commercial real estate\nportfolio driven by the office\nproperty type.\n\nThe increase in consumer net loan\ncharge-offs in third quarter 2024,\ncompared with the same period a year\nago, was due to higher losses in our\ncredit card portfolio driven by\nhigher loan balances, partially\noffset by lower losses in our auto\nportfolio.\n\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES We\nmaintain an allowance for credit\nlosses (ACL) for loans, which is\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of the expected\nlifetime credit losses in the loan\nportfolio and unfunded credit\ncommitments, at the balance sheet\ndate, excluding loans and unfunded\ncredit commitments carried at fair\nvalue or held for sale. Additionally,\nwe maintain an ACL for debt\nsecurities classified as either AFS\nor HTM, other financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost, including\ndeposits with banks, net investments\nin leases, and other off-balance\nsheet credit exposures.\n\nThe process for establishing the ACL\nfor loans takes into consideration\nmany factors, including historical\nand forecasted loss trends, loan-\nlevel credit quality ratings and loan\ngrade-specific characteristics. The\nprocess involves subjective and\ncomplex judgments. In addition, we\nreview a variety of credit metrics\nand trends. These credit metrics and\ntrends, however, do not solely\ndetermine the amount of the allowance\nas we use several analytical tools.\nFor additional information on our\nACL, see the \u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies \u2013 Allowance for Credit\nLosses\u201d section and Note 1 (Summary\nof Significant Accounting Policies)\nto Financial Statements in our 2023\nForm 10-K. For additional information\non our ACL for loans, see Note 5\n(Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses) to Financial\nStatements in this Report, and for\nadditional information on our ACL for\ndebt securities, see Note 3\n(Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\nMaturity Debt Securities) to\nFinancial Statements in this Report.\n\nTable 22 presents the allocation of\nthe ACL for loans by loan

Total net loan charge-offs are\nannualized for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n\nThe ratios for the allowance for loan\nlosses and the ACL for loans\npresented in Table 22 may fluctuate\nfrom period to period due to such\nfactors as the mix of loan types in\nthe portfolio, borrower credit\nstrength, and the value and\nmarketability of collateral. The ACL\nfor loans decreased $349 million, or\n2%, from December 31, 2023,\nreflecting decreases for auto loans,\ncommercial real estate loans, and\nresidential mortgage loans, partially\noffset by increases for credit card\nloans. The detail of the changes in\nthe ACL for loans by portfolio\nsegment (including charge-offs and\nrecoveries by loan class) is included\nin Note 5 (Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit Losses) to\nFinancial Statements in this Report.\nWe consider multiple economic\nscenarios to develop our estimate of\nthe ACL for loans, which generally\ninclude a base scenario, along with\nan optimistic (upside) and one or\nmore pessimistic (downside)\nscenarios. We weighted the base\nscenario and the downside scenarios\nin our estimate of the ACL for loans\nat September 30, 2024. The base\nscenario assumed slowing inflation\nwith slowing economic growth and also\nreflected a significant decline in\ncommercial real estate prices and\nincreased unemployment rates from\nhistorically low levels. The downside\nscenarios assumed a more substantial\neconomic contraction due to declining\nproperty values, high inflation, and\nlower business and consumer\nconfidence. Additionally, we consider\nqualitative factors that represent\nthe risk of limitations inherent in\nour processes and assumptions such as\neconomic environmental factors,\nmodeling assumptions and performance,\nand other subjective factors,\nincluding industry trends and\nemerging risk assessments.\n\nThe forecasted key economic variables\nused in our estimate of the ACL for\nloans at September 30, 2024, and June\n30, 2024, are presented in Table 23.\nTable 23: Forecasted Key Economic\nVariables\n                                                                             \n                                4Q 2024           2Q 2025           4Q 2025  \n  Weighted blend of                                                          \n  economic scenarios:                                                        \n  U.S. unemployment                                                          \n  rate (1):                                                                  \n  September 30, 2024       4.4  %            4.9               5.7           \n  June 30, 2024            4.4               5.2               5.8           \n  U.S. real GDP (2):                                                         \n  September 30, 2024       0.2              -0.5               0.3           \n  June 30, 2024           -0.4              -0.5               0.9           \n  Home price index                                                           \n  (3):                                                                       \n  September 30, 2024       1.2              -2.3              -4.6           \n  June 30, 2024           -0.4              -4.0              -4.6           \n  Commercial real                                                            \n  estate asset prices                                                        \n  (3):                                                                       \n  September 30, 2024      -2.2              -8.8             -10.6           \n  June 30, 2024           -6.7             -12.1              -9.4           \n                                                                             \n(1) Quarterly average. (2) Percent\nchange from the preceding period,\nseasonally adjusted annualized rate.\n(3) Percent change year over year of\nnational average; outlook differs by\ngeography and property type. Future\namounts of the ACL for loans will be\nbased on a variety of factors,\nincluding loan balance changes,\nportfolio credit quality and mix\nchanges, and changes in general\neconomic conditions and expectations\n(including for unemployment and real\nGDP), among other factors.\n                               \n  38    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nWe believe the ACL for loans of $14.7\nbillion at September 30, 2024, was\nappropriate to cover expected credit\nlosses, including unfunded credit\ncommitments, at that date. The entire\nallowance is available to absorb\ncredit losses from the total loan\nportfolio. The ACL for loans is\nsubject to change and reflects\nexisting factors as of the date of\ndetermination, including economic or\nmarket conditions and ongoing\ninternal and external examination\nprocesses. Due to the sensitivity of\nthe ACL for loans to changes in the\neconomic and business environment, it\nis possible that we will incur\nincremental credit losses not\nanticipated as of the balance sheet\ndate. Our process for determining the\nACL is discussed in the \u201cCritical\nAccounting Policies \u2013 Allowance for\nCredit Losses\u201d section and Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial Statements in\nour 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nMORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES We sell\nresidential and commercial mortgage\nloans to various parties. In\nconnection with our sales and\nsecuritization of residential\nmortgage loans, we have established a\nmortgage repurchase liability. For\ninformation on our repurchase\nliability, see the \u201cRisk Management \u2013\nCredit Risk Management \u2013 Mortgage\nBanking Activities\u201d section in our\n2023 Form 10-K.\n\nIn addition to servicing loans in our\nportfolio, we act as servicer and/or\nmaster servicer of residential and\ncommercial mortgage loans included in\ngovernment-sponsored enterprise (GSE)\nmortgage securitizations, GNMA-\nguaranteed mortgage securitizations\nof FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed\nmortgages and private label mortgage\nsecuritizations, as well as for\nunsecuritized loans owned by\ninstitutional investors.\n\nAs a servicer, we are required to\nadvance certain delinquent payments\nof principal and interest on mortgage\nloans we service. The amount and\ntiming of reimbursement for advances\nof delinquent payments vary by\ninvestor and the applicable servicing\nagreements. See Note 6 (Mortgage\nBanking Activities) to Financial\nStatements in this Report for\nadditional information about\nresidential and commercial servicing\nrights, servicer advances and\nservicing fees.\n\nIn accordance with applicable\nservicing guidelines, upon transfer\nas servicer, we have the option to\nrepurchase loans from certain loan\nsecuritizations, which generally\nbecomes exercisable based on\ndelinquency status such as when three\nscheduled loan payments are past due.\nWhen we have the unilateral option to\nrepurchase a loan, we recognize the\nloan and a corresponding liability on\nour balance sheet regardless of our\nintent to repurchase the loan. We may\nrepurchase these loans for cash and\nas a result, our total consolidated\nassets do not change.\n\nLoans repurchased from GNMA\nsecuritization pools that regain\ncurrent status or are otherwise\nmodified in accordance with\napplicable servicing guidelines may\nbe included in future GNMA loan\nsecuritization pools. At September\n30, 2024, and December 31, 2023,\nthese loans, which we have\nrepurchased or have the unilateral\noption to repurchase, were $7.5\nbillion and $7.8 billion,\nrespectively, which included $7.1\nbillion and $7.4 billion,\nrespectively, in loans held for\ninvestment, with the remainder in\nloans held for sale. See Note 13\n(Securitizations and Variable\nInterest Entities) to Financial\nStatements in this Report for\nadditional information about our\ninvolvement with mortgage loan\nsecuritizations.\n\nFor additional information about the\nrisks related to our servicing\nactivities, see the \u201cRisk Management\n\u2013 Credit Risk Management \u2013 Mortgage\nBanking Activities\u201d section in our\n2023 Form 10-K. For additional\ninformation on mortgage banking\nactivities, see Note 6 (Mortgage\nBanking Activities) to Financial\nStatements in this Report.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    39  \n                               \nAsset/Liability Management\nAsset/liability management involves\nmeasuring, monitoring and managing\ninterest rate risk, market risk,\nliquidity and funding. For additional\ninformation on our oversight of\nasset/liability risks, see the \"Risk\nManagement \u2013 Asset/Liability\nManagement\" section in our 2023 Form\n10-K. INTEREST RATE RISK Interest\nrate risk is the risk that market\nfluctuations in interest rates,\ncredit spreads, or foreign exchange\ncan cause a loss of the Company\u2019s\nearnings and capital stemming from\nmismatches in the cash flows of the\nCompany\u2019s assets and liabilities\ngenerally arising from customer-\nrelated lending and deposit-taking\nactivities. We are subject to\ninterest rate risk because: \u2022 assets\nand liabilities may mature or reprice\nat different times or by different\namounts; \u2022 short-term and long-term\nmarket interest rates may change\nindependently or with different\nmagnitudes; \u2022 the remaining maturity\nfor various assets or liabilities may\nshorten or lengthen as interest rates\nchange; or \u2022 interest rates may also\nhave a direct or indirect effect on\nloan demand, collateral values,\ncredit losses, loan origination\nvolume, and the fair value of\nfinancial instruments and MSRs. We\nassess interest rate risk by\ncomparing the earnings outcomes from\nmultiple interest rate scenarios\nrelative to our base scenario. The\nbase scenario is a reference point\nused by the Company for financial\nplanning purposes. These scenarios\nmay differ in the direction of\ninterest rate changes, the degree and\nspeed of interest rate changes over\ntime, and the projected shape of the\nyield curve. They also require\nassumptions regarding drivers of\nearnings and balance sheet\ncomposition such as loan\noriginations, prepayment rates on\nloans and debt securities, deposit\nflows and mix, as well as pricing\nstrategies. We periodically assess\nand enhance our scenarios and\nassumptions. Table 24 presents the\nresults of the estimated net interest\nincome sensitivity over the next 12\nmonths from the multiple scenarios\ncompared with our base scenario.\nThese hypothetical scenarios include\ninstantaneous movements across the\nyield curve with both lower and\nhigher interest rates under a\nparallel shift, as well as steeper\nand flatter non-parallel changes in\nthe yield curve. Long-term interest\nrates are defined as all tenors three\nyears and longer, and short-term\ninterest rates are defined as all\ntenors less than three years. Our\nscenario assumptions reflected the\nfollowing: \u2022 Scenarios are dynamic\nand reflect anticipated changes to\nour assets and liabilities over time.\n\u2022 Mortgage prepayment and origination\nassumptions vary across scenarios and\nreflect only the impact of the higher\nor lower interest rates. \u2022 Other\nmacroeconomic variables that could be\ncorrelated with the changes in\ninterest rates are held constant. \u2022\nThe funding forecast in our base\nscenario incorporates deposit mix\nchanges and market funding levels\nconsistent with the base interest\nrate trajectory. Our hypothetical\nscenarios incorporate deposit mix\nthat is the same as in the base\nscenario. In higher interest rate\nscenarios, potential customer deposit\nactivity that shifts balances into\nhigher yielding products and/or\nrequires additional market funding\ncould reduce the expected benefit\nfrom higher rates. Conversely, in\nlower interest rate scenarios, a\npotential shift to a funding mix with\nlower yielding deposits and/or less\nmarket funding could reduce the\nimpact of lower rates on earning\nassets in these scenarios.\n\n\u2022 The interest rate sensitivity of\ndeposits as market interest rates\nchange, referred to as deposit betas,\nare informed by historical behavior\nand expectations for near-term\npricing strategies. Our actual\nexperience may differ from\nexpectations due to the lag or\nacceleration of deposit repricing,\nchanges in consumer behavior, and\nother factors.

Our interest rate\nsensitivity indicates that we would\nexpect to benefit from higher\ninterest rates as our assets would\nreprice faster and to a greater\ndegree than our liabilities, while in\nthe case of lower interest rates, our\nassets would reprice downward and to\na greater degree than our liabilities\nresulting in lower net interest\nincome. The realized impact of\ninterest rate changes may vary from\nour base and hypothetical scenarios\nfor various reasons, including any\ndeposit pricing lags. We use interest\nrate derivatives and our debt\nsecurities portfolio to manage our\ninterest rate exposures. We use\nderivatives for asset/liability\nmanagement to (i) convert cash flows\nfrom selected assets and/or\nliabilities from floating-rate\npayments to fixed-rate payments, or\nvice versa, (ii) reduce accumulated\nother comprehensive income (AOCI)\nsensitivity of our AFS debt\nsecurities portfolio, and/or (iii)\neconomically hedge our mortgage\norigination pipeline, funded mortgage\nloans, and MSRs. Derivatives used to\nhedge our interest rate risk\nexposures are presented in Note 11\n(Derivatives) to Financial Statements\nin this Report. As interest rates\nincrease, changes in the fair value\nof AFS debt securities may negatively\naffect AOCI, which lowers the amount\nof our regulatory capital. AOCI also\nincludes unrealized gains or losses\nrelated to the transfer of debt\nsecurities from AFS to HTM, which are\nsubsequently amortized into earnings\nover the life of the security with no\nfurther impact from interest rate\nchanges. See Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) and\nNote 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-\nto-Maturity Debt Securities) to\nFinancial Statements in this Report\nfor additional information on our\ndebt securities portfolio. In\naddition to the net interest income\nsensitivity above, we also measure\nand evaluate the economic value\nsensitivity (EVS) of our balance\nsheet. EVS is the change in the\npresent value of the life-time cash\nflows of the Company\u2019s assets and\nliabilities across a range of\nscenarios. It is based on the\nexisting balance sheet, at a point in\ntime, and helps indicate whether we\nare exposed to higher or lower\ninterest rates. We manage EVS through\na set of limits that are designed to\nalign with our interest rate risk\nappetite. Our interest rate sensitive\nnoninterest income and expense are\nimpacted by mortgage banking\nactivities that may have\n                               \n  40    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nsensitivity impacts that move in the\nopposite direction of our net\ninterest income. See the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Asset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Mortgage Banking\nInterest Rate and Market Risk\u201d\nsection in our 2023 Form 10-K for\nadditional information.\n\nInterest rate sensitive noninterest\nincome is also impacted by changes in\nearnings credit for noninterest-\nbearing deposits that reduce treasury\nmanagement deposit-related service\nfees on commercial accounts, and by\ntrading assets. In addition, the\nimpact to net interest income does\nnot include the fair value changes of\ntrading securities, which, along with\nthe effects of related economic\nhedges, are recorded in noninterest\nincome. In addition to changes in\ninterest rates, net interest income\nand noninterest income from trading\nsecurities may be impacted by the\nactual composition of the trading\nportfolio. For additional information\non our trading assets and\nliabilities, see Note 2 (Trading\nActivities) to Financial Statements\nin this Report.\n\nMORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND\nMARKET RISK We originate and service\nmortgage loans, which subjects us to\nvarious risks, including market,\ninterest rate, credit, and liquidity\nrisks that can be substantial. Based\non market conditions and other\nfactors, we reduce credit and\nliquidity risks by selling or\nsecuritizing mortgage loans. We\ndetermine whether mortgage loans will\nbe held for investment or held for\nsale at the time of commitment, but\nmay change our intent to hold loans\nfor investment or sale as part of our\ncorporate asset/liability management\nactivities. We may also retain\nsecurities in our investment\nportfolio at the time we securitize\nmortgage loans.\n\nChanges in interest rates may impact\nmortgage banking noninterest income,\nincluding origination and servicing\nfees, and the fair value of our\nresidential MSRs, LHFS, and\nderivative loan commitments (interest\nrate \u201clocks\u201d) extended to mortgage\napplicants. Interest rate changes\nwill generally impact our mortgage\nbanking noninterest income on a\nlagging basis due to the time it\ntakes for the market to reflect a\nshift in customer demand, as well as\nthe time required for processing a\nnew application, providing the\ncommitment, and securitizing and\nselling the loan. The amount and\ntiming of the impact will depend on\nthe magnitude, speed and duration of\nthe changes in interest rates. For\nadditional information on mortgage\nbanking, including key assumptions\nand the sensitivity of the fair value\nof MSRs, see the \u201cRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability Management \u2013 Mortgage\nBanking Interest Rate and Market\nRisk\u201d section and Note 6 (Mortgage\nBanking Activities), Note 14\n(Derivatives), and Note 15 (Fair\nValues of Assets and Liabilities) to\nFinancial Statements in our 2023 Form\n10-K.\n\nMARKET RISK Market risk is the risk\nof possible economic loss from\nadverse changes in market risk\nfactors such as interest rates,\ncredit spreads, foreign exchange\nrates, equity and commodity prices,\nand the risk of possible loss due to\ncounterparty exposure. This applies\nto implied volatility risk, basis\nrisk, and market liquidity risk. It\nincludes price risk in the trading\nbook, mortgage servicing rights, the\nhedge effectiveness risk associated\nwith the mortgage book held at fair\nvalue, and impairment on private\nequity investments. For additional\ninformation on our oversight of\nmarket risk, see the \u201cRisk Management\n\u2013 Asset/Liability Management \u2013 Market\nRisk\u201d section in our 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nMARKET RISK \u2013 TRADING ACTIVITIES We\nengage in trading activities to\naccommodate the investment and risk\nmanagement activities of our\ncustomers and to execute economic\nhedging to manage certain balance\nsheet risks. These trading activities\npredominantly occur within our CIB\nbusinesses. Debt and equity\nsecurities held for trading, trading\nloans, and trading derivatives are\nfinancial instruments used in our\ntrading activities, and are measured\nat fair value through earnings.\nIncome earned on the financial\ninstruments used in our trading\nactivities include net interest\nincome, changes in fair value, and\nrealized gains and losses. Net\ninterest income earned from our\ntrading activities is reflected in\nthe interest income and interest\nexpense components of our\nconsolidated statement of income.\nChanges in fair value and realized\ngains and losses of the financial\ninstruments used in our trading\nactivities are reflected in net gains\nfrom trading activities. For\nadditional information on the\nfinancial instruments used in our\ntrading activities and the income\nfrom these trading activities, see\nNote 2 (Trading Activities) to\nFinancial Statements in this Report.\n\nValue-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical\nrisk measure used to estimate the\npotential loss from adverse moves in\nthe financial markets, and Trading\nVaR is a measure used to provide\ninsight into the market risk\nexhibited by the Company\u2019s trading\npositions on our consolidated balance\nsheet. The Company uses these VaR\nmetrics complemented with sensitivity\nanalysis and stress testing in\nmeasuring and monitoring market risk.\nTable 25 shows the Company\u2019s Trading\nGeneral VaR by risk category.

The\ndiversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly correlated\ncausing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the\nrisks of the positions alone.

We\nmake and manage equity investments in\nvarious businesses, such as start-up\ncompanies and emerging growth\ncompanies. We also invest in funds\nthat make similar private equity\ninvestments. For additional\ninformation, see the \u201cRisk Management\n\u2013 Asset/Liability Management \u2013 Market\nRisk \u2013 Equity Securities\u201d section in\nour 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nAs part of our business to support\nour customers, we trade public\nequities, listed/over-the-counter\nequity derivatives, and convertible\nbonds. We have parameters that govern\nthese activities. We also have equity\nsecurities that include investments\nrelating to our venture capital\nactivities. For additional\ninformation, see Note 4 (Equity\nSecurities) to Financial Statements\nin this Report.\n\nChanges in equity market prices may\nalso indirectly affect our net income\nby (1) the value of third-party\nassets under management and, hence,\nfee income, (2) borrowers whose\nability to repay principal and/or\ninterest may be affected by the stock\nmarket, or (3) brokerage activity,\nrelated commission income and other\nbusiness activities. Each business\nline monitors and manages these\nindirect risks.\n\nLIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING Liquidity\nrisk is the risk arising from the\ninability of the Company to meet\nobligations when they come due, or\nroll over funds at a reasonable cost,\nwithout incurring heightened costs.\nIn the ordinary course of business,\nwe enter into contractual obligations\nthat may require future cash\npayments, including funding for\ncustomer loan requests, customer\ndeposit maturities and withdrawals,\ndebt service, leases for premises and\nequipment, and other cash\ncommitments. Liquidity risk also\nconsiders the stability of deposits,\nincluding the risk of losing\nuninsured or non-operational\ndeposits. The objective of effective\nliquidity management is to be able to\nmeet our contractual obligations and\nother cash commitments efficiently\nunder both normal operating\nconditions and under periods of Wells\nFargo-specific and/or market stress.\n\nTo help achieve this objective, the\nBoard establishes liquidity\nguidelines that require sufficient\nasset-based liquidity to cover\npotential funding requirements and to\navoid over-dependence on volatile,\nless reliable funding markets. These\nguidelines are\n\nmonitored on a monthly basis by the\nmanagement-level Corporate\nAsset/Liability Committee and on a\nquarterly basis by the Board. These\nguidelines are established and\nmonitored for both the Company and\nthe Parent on a stand-alone basis so\nthat the Parent is a source of\nstrength for its banking\nsubsidiaries. For additional\ninformation on liquidity risk and\nfunding management, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Liquidity Risk and\nFunding\u201d section in our 2023 Form\n10-K.\n\nLiquidity Standards We are subject to\na rule issued by the FRB, OCC and\nFDIC that establishes a quantitative\nminimum liquidity requirement, known\nas the liquidity coverage ratio\n(LCR). The rule requires a covered\nbanking organization to hold high-\nquality liquid assets (HQLA) in an\namount equal to or greater than its\nprojected net cash outflows during a\n30-day stress period. Our HQLA under\nthe rule mainly consists of central\nbank deposits, government debt\nsecurities, and mortgage-backed\nsecurities of federal agencies. The\nLCR applies to the Company and to our\ninsured depository institutions\n(IDIs) with total assets of $10\nbillion or more. In addition, rules\nissued by the FRB impose enhanced\nliquidity risk management standards\non large bank holding companies\n(BHCs), such as Wells Fargo.\n\nWe are also subject to a rule issued\nby the FRB, OCC and FDIC that\nestablishes a stable funding\nrequirement, known as the net stable\nfunding ratio (NSFR), which requires\na covered banking organization, such\nas Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum\namount of stable funding, including\ncommon equity, long-term debt and\nmost types of deposits, in relation\nto its assets, derivative exposures\nand commitments over a one-year\nhorizon period. The NSFR applies to\nthe Company and to our IDIs with\ntotal assets of $10 billion or more.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we were\ncompliant with the NSFR requirement.\n\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company,\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Wells\nFargo National Bank West exceeded the\nminimum LCR requirement of 100%. The\nLCR represents average HQLA divided\nby average projected net cash\noutflows, as each is defined under\nthe LCR rule.\n\nTable 26 presents the Company\u2019s\nquarterly average values for the\ndaily-calculated LCR and its\ncomponents calculated pursuant to the\nLCR rule requirements.\n                                                                             \n   Table 26:                                                                 \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n   Liquidity Coverage Ratio                                                  \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n                                                                  Average    \n                                                                  for        \n  (in                                                             quarter    \n  million\u2026                                                        ended      \n  except                Sep 30,             Jun 30,               Sep 30,    \n  ratio)                   2024             2024                  2023       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  HQLA                                                                       \n  (1):                                                                       \n  Eligible    $         176,218    190,761               154,258             \n  cash                                                                       \n  Eligible                                                                   \n  securit\u2026              193,282    165,530               191,606             \n  (2)                                                                        \n  Total                 369,500    356,291               345,864             \n  HQLA                                                                       \n  Project\u2026                                                                   \n  net cash              290,236    286,631               280,468             \n  outflows                                                                   \n  (3)                                                                        \n  LCR            127          %        124                   123             \n                                                                             \n(1) Excludes excess HQLA at certain\nsubsidiaries that are not\ntransferable to other Wells Fargo\nentities.\n\n(2) Net of applicable haircuts\nrequired under the LCR rule.\n\n(3) Projected net cash outflows are\ncalculated by applying a standardized\nset of outflow and inflow\nassumptions, defined by the LCR rule,\nto various exposures and liability\ntypes, such as deposits and unfunded\nloan commitments, which are\nprescribed based on a number of\nfactors, including the type of\ncustomer and the nature of the\naccount.\n\nLiquidity Sources We maintain\nliquidity in the form of cash,\ninterest-earning deposits with banks,\nand unencumbered high-quality, liquid\ndebt securities.

We believe the debt\nsecurities included in Table 27\nprovide quick and reliable sources of\nliquidity through sales or by\npledging to obtain financing,\nregardless of market conditions. Debt\nsecurities within our HTM portfolio\nare not intended for sale but may be\npledged to obtain financing.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had\napproximately $593.7 billion of\navailable borrowing capacity at\nvarious Federal Home Loan Banks\n(FHLB) and the Federal Reserve\nDiscount Window, based on collateral\npledged. Although available, we do\nnot view this borrowing capacity as a\nprimary source of liquidity.\n\nIn addition, liquidity is also\navailable through the sale or\nfinancing of other debt securities,\nincluding trading and/or AFS debt\nsecurities, as well as through the\nsale, securitization, or financing of\nloans, to the extent such debt\nsecurities and loans are not\nencumbered.\n\nFunding Sources The Parent acts as a\nsource of funding for the Company\nthrough the issuance of long-term\ndebt and equity. WFC Holdings, LLC\n(the \u201cIHC\u201d) is an intermediate\nholding company and subsidiary of the\nParent, which provides funding\nsupport for the ongoing operational\nrequirements of the Parent\n\nand certain of its direct and\nindirect subsidiaries. For additional\ninformation on the IHC, see the\n\u201cRegulatory Matters \u2013 \u2018Living Will\u2019\nRequirements and Related Matters\u201d\nsection in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nAdditional subsidiary funding is\nprovided by deposits, short-term\nborrowings and long-term debt.\n\nDeposits have historically provided a\nsizable source of relatively low-cost\nfunds. Loans were 67% and 69% of\ntotal deposits at September 30, 2024,\nand December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nTable 28 presents a summary of our\nshort-term borrowings, which\ngenerally mature in less than 30\ndays. The balances of federal funds\npurchased and securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase may vary\nover time due to client activity, our\nown demand for financing, and our\noverall mix of liabilities.

We primarily fund our\ncapital needs through the retention\nof earnings net of both dividends and\nshare repurchases, as well as through\nthe issuance of preferred stock and\nlong- and short-term debt. For\nadditional information about capital\nplanning, see the \u201cCapital Planning\nand Stress Testing\u201d section below.\n                                                                             \n  Regulatory Capital Requirements                                            \n                                                                             \nThe Company and each of our IDIs are\nsubject to various regulatory capital\nadequacy requirements administered by\nthe FRB and the OCC. Risk-based\ncapital rules establish risk-adjusted\nratios relating regulatory capital to\ndifferent categories of assets and\noff-balance sheet exposures as\ndiscussed below.\n\nRISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED\nASSETS The Company is subject to\nrules issued by federal banking\nregulators to implement Basel III\ncapital requirements for U.S. banking\norganizations. The rules contain two\nframeworks for calculating capital\nrequirements, a Standardized Approach\nand an Advanced Approach applicable\nto certain institutions, including\nWells Fargo, and we must calculate\nour risk-based capital ratios under\nboth approaches. The Company is\nrequired to satisfy the risk-based\ncapital ratio requirements to avoid\nrestrictions on capital distributions\nand discretionary bonus payments.\n\nIn July 2023, federal banking\nregulators issued a proposed rule to\nimplement the final components of\nBasel III, which would impact risk-\nbased capital requirements for\ncertain banks. The proposed rule\nwould eliminate the current Advanced\nApproach and replace it with a new\nexpanded risk-based approach for the\nmeasurement of risk-weighted assets,\nincluding more granular risk weights\nfor credit risk, a new market risk\nframework, and a new standardized\napproach for measuring operational\nrisk. Officials from federal banking\nregulators have since commented that\nthere may be significant changes to\nthe proposed rule.\n\nTable 31 and Table 32 present the\nrisk-based capital requirements\napplicable to the Company under the\nStandardized Approach and Advanced\nApproach, respectively, as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n\nTable 31: Risk-Based Capital\nRequirements \u2013 Standardized Approach\n\nTable 32: Risk-Based Capital\nRequirements \u2013 Advanced Approach\n\nIn addition to the risk-based capital\nrequirements described in Table 31\nand Table 32, if the FRB determines\nthat a period of excessive credit\ngrowth is contributing to an increase\nin systemic risk, a countercyclical\nbuffer of up to 2.50% could be added\nto the risk-based capital ratio\nrequirements under federal banking\nregulations. The countercyclical\nbuffer in effect at September 30,\n2024, was 0.00%.\n\nThe capital conservation buffer is\napplicable to certain institutions,\nincluding Wells Fargo, under the\nAdvanced Approach and is intended to\nabsorb losses during times of\neconomic or financial stress.\n\nThe stress capital buffer is\ncalculated based on the decrease in a\nBHC\u2019s risk-based capital ratios under\nthe severely adverse scenario in the\nFRB\u2019s annual supervisory stress test\nand related Comprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review (CCAR), plus four\nquarters of planned common stock\ndividends. Because the stress capital\nbuffer is calculated annually based\non data that can differ over time,\nour stress capital buffer, and thus\nour risk-based capital ratio\nrequirements under the Standardized\nApproach, are subject to change in\nfuture periods. Our stress capital\nbuffer for the period October 1,\n2023, through September 30, 2024, was\n2.90%. Our stress capital buffer for\nthe period October 1, 2024, through\nSeptember 30, 2025, is 3.80%.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    45  \n                               \n                                                                             \n  Capital Management(continued)                                              \n                                                                             \nAs a global systemically important\nbank (G-SIB), we are also subject to\nthe FRB\u2019s rule implementing an\nadditional capital surcharge between\n1.00-4.50% on the risk-based capital\nratio requirements of G-SIBs. Under\nthe rule, we must annually calculate\nour surcharge under two methods and\nuse the higher of the two surcharges.\nThe first method (method one)\nconsiders our size,\ninterconnectedness, cross-\njurisdictional activity,\nsubstitutability, and complexity,\nconsistent with the methodology\ndeveloped by the BCBS and the\nFinancial Stability Board (FSB). The\nsecond method (method two) uses\nsimilar inputs, but replaces\nsubstitutability with use of short-\nterm wholesale funding and will\ngenerally result in higher surcharges\nthan under method one. Because the\nG-SIB capital surcharge is calculated\nannually based on data that can\ndiffer over time, the amount of the\nsurcharge is subject to change in\nfuture years. If our annual\ncalculation results in a decrease to\nour G-SIB capital surcharge, the\ndecrease takes effect the next\ncalendar year. If our annual\ncalculation results in an increase to\nour G-SIB capital\n\nsurcharge, the increase takes effect\nin two calendar years. Our G-SIB\ncapital surcharge will continue to be\n1.50% in 2024. On July 27, 2023, the\nFRB issued a proposed rule that would\nimpact the methodology used to\ncalculate the G-SIB capital\nsurcharge.\n\nUnder the risk-based capital rules,\non-balance sheet assets and credit\nequivalent amounts of derivatives and\noff-balance sheet items are assigned\nto one of several broad risk\ncategories according to the obligor,\nor, if relevant, the guarantor or the\nnature of any collateral. The\naggregate dollar amount in each risk\ncategory is then multiplied by the\nrisk weight associated with that\ncategory. The resulting weighted\nvalues from each of the risk\ncategories are aggregated for\ndetermining total risk-weighted\nassets (RWAs).\n\nThe tables that follow provide\ninformation about our risk-based\ncapital and related ratios as\ncalculated under Basel III capital\nrules. Table 33 summarizes our CET1,\nTier 1 capital, Total capital, RWAs\nand capital ratios.\n                                                                             \n  Table 33:

period-end.\n\n(2) Includes a $60 million increase and $120 million increase at September\n30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to a current expected\ncredit loss accounting standard (CECL) transition provision. In second\nquarter 2020, the Company elected to apply a modified transition provision\nissued by federal banking regulators related to the impact of CECL on\nregulatory capital. The rule permits certain banking organizations to exclude\nfrom regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of CECL, plus 25% of the\ncumulative changes in the allowance for credit losses (ACL) under CECL for\neach period until December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year phase-out\nperiod in which the benefit is reduced by 25% in year one, 50% in year two\nand 75% in year three.\n\n(3) Differences between the approaches are driven by the qualifying amounts\nof ACL includable in Tier 2 capital. Under the Advanced Approach, eligible\ncredit reserves represented by the amount of qualifying ACL in excess of\nexpected credit losses (using regulatory definitions) is limited to 0.60% of\nAdvanced credit RWAs, whereas the Standardized Approach includes ACL in Tier\n2 capital up to 1.25% of Standardized credit RWAs. Under both approaches, any\nexcess ACL is deducted from the respective total RWAs.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    47  \n                               \n                                                                             \n  Capital Management(continued)                                              \n                                                                             \nTable 35 provides the composition and\nnet changes in the components of RWAs\nunder the Standardized and Advanced\nApproaches.\n                                                                             \n  Table 35:                                                                  \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Risk-Weighted Assets                                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  (\u2026                                                                         \n  m\u2026                                 $                                $      \n  R\u2026            Sep         Dec    Ch\u2026             S\u2026         D\u2026    Ch\u2026  A\u2026  \n  a\u2026            30,         31,    20\u2026  S\u2026         3\u2026         3\u2026    20\u2026  A\u2026  \n  (\u2026            20\u2026         20\u2026    20\u2026  A\u2026         2\u2026         2\u2026    20\u2026  (\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  C\u2026    $  1,\u2026         1,\u2026         -1\u2026        73\u2026        75\u2026        -2\u2026      \n  r\u2026                                                                         \n  M\u2026       53\u2026         48\u2026         4,\u2026        53\u2026        48\u2026        4,\u2026      \n  r\u2026                                                                         \n  O\u2026       N/A         N/A         N/A        29\u2026        30\u2026        -8\u2026      \n  r\u2026                                                                         \n  T\u2026    $  1,\u2026         1,\u2026         -1\u2026        1,\u2026        1,\u2026        -2\u2026      \n  R\u2026                                                                         \n                                                                             \n(1) RWAs calculated under the\nAdvanced Approach utilize a risk-\nsensitive methodology, which relies\nupon the use of internal credit\nmodels based upon our experience with\ninternal rating grades.

Management believes that\ntangible book value per common share\nand return on average tangible common\nequity, which utilize tangible common\nequity, are useful financial measures\nbecause they enable management,\ninvestors, and others to assess the\nCompany\u2019s use of equity.\n\nTable 37 provides a reconciliation of\nthese non-GAAP financial measures to\nGAAP financial measures.\n                                                                             \n  Table 37:                                                                  \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Tangible Common Equity                                                     \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n                                                   \u2026                         \n                                                   \u2026                         \n                \u2026      \u2026                    \u2026      \u2026      \u2026                  \n                \u2026      \u2026                    \u2026      \u2026      \u2026                  \n                \u2026      \u2026                    \u2026      \u2026      \u2026                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n           $                    \u2026           \u2026                           \u2026    \n                                                                             \n                                \u2026                                \u2026      \u2026    \n                                \u2026                                \u2026      \u2026    \n                                \u2026                                \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026                         \u2026                                \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                             \n                                \u2026                                \u2026      \u2026    \n                                \u2026                                \u2026      \u2026    \n                                \u2026                                \u2026      \u2026    \n                                \u2026                                \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026    $                    \u2026                                \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026                         \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026                  \n      \u2026         \u2026      \u2026               $                         \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026    $                    \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026                  \n      \u2026                         \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026                  \n      \u2026         \u2026      \u2026                    %                    \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026         \u2026      \u2026                                         \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                             \n(1) In third quarter 2023, we sold\ninvestments in certain private equity\nfunds.

OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL\nAND LIQUIDITY MATTERS For information\nregarding the U.S. implementation of\nthe Basel III LCR and NSFR, see the\n\u201cRisk Management \u2013 Asset/ Liability\nManagement \u2013 Liquidity Risk and\nFunding \u2013 Liquidity Standards\u201d\nsection in this Report. Our principal\nU.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries,\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, and\nWells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC,\nare subject to regulations to\nmaintain minimum net capital\nrequirements. As of September 30,\n2024, these broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries were in compliance with\ntheir respective regulatory minimum\nnet capital requirements. Capital\nPlanning and Stress Testing Our\nplanned long-term capital structure\nis designed to meet regulatory and\nmarket expectations. We believe that\nour long-term targeted capital\nstructure enables us to invest in and\ngrow our business, satisfy our\ncustomers\u2019 financial needs in varying\nenvironments, access markets, and\nmaintain flexibility to return\ncapital to our shareholders. Our\nlong-term targeted capital structure\nalso considers capital levels\nsufficient to exceed capital\nrequirements, including the G-SIB\ncapital surcharge and the stress\ncapital buffer, as well as potential\nchanges to regulatory requirements\nfor our capital ratios, planned\ncapital actions, changes in our risk\nprofile and other factors.\nAccordingly, our long-term target\ncapital levels are set above their\nrespective regulatory minimums plus\nbuffers. During the first nine months\nof 2024, we issued $929 million of\ncommon stock, substantially all of\nwhich was issued in connection with\nemployee compensation and benefits,\nand we repurchased 275 million shares\nof common stock at a cost of $15.6\nbillion. We paid $4.6 billion of\ncommon and preferred stock dividends\nduring the first nine months of 2024.\nThe FRB capital plan rule establishes\ncapital planning and other\nrequirements that govern capital\ndistributions, including dividends\nand share repurchases, by certain\nBHCs, including Wells Fargo. The FRB\nassesses, among other things, the\noverall financial condition, risk\nprofile, and capital adequacy of BHCs\nwhen evaluating their capital plans.\nAs part of the annual CCAR, the FRB\ngenerates a supervisory stress test.\nThe FRB reviews the supervisory\nstress test results as required under\nthe Dodd-Frank Act using a common set\nof\n                               \n  50    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \ncapital actions for all large BHCs\nand also reviews the Company\u2019s\nproposed capital actions.\n\nFederal banking regulators also\nrequire large BHCs and banks to\nconduct their own stress tests to\nevaluate whether the institution has\nsufficient capital to continue to\noperate during periods of adverse\neconomic and financial conditions.\n                                                                             \n  Securities Repurchases                                                     \n                                                                             \nOn July 25, 2023, we announced that\nour Board authorized a common stock\nrepurchase program of up to $30\nbillion. Unless modified or revoked\nby the Board, this authorization does\nnot expire and is our only common\nstock repurchase program in effect.\nAt September 30, 2024, we had\nremaining Board authority to\nrepurchase up to approximately $11.3\nbillion of common stock.\n\nVarious factors impact the amount and\ntiming of our share repurchases,\nincluding the earnings, cash\nrequirements and financial condition\nof the Company, the impact to our\nbalance sheet of expected customer\nactivity, our capital requirements\n\nand long-term targeted capital\nstructure, the results of supervisory\nstress tests, market conditions\n(including the trading price of our\nstock), and regulatory and legal\nconsiderations, including regulatory\nrequirements under the FRB\u2019s capital\nplan rule. Although we announce when\nthe Board authorizes a share\nrepurchase program, we typically do\nnot give any public notice before we\nrepurchase our shares. Due to the\nvarious factors that may impact the\namount and timing of our share\nrepurchases and the fact that we may\nbe in the market throughout the year,\nour share repurchases occur at\nvarious prices. We may suspend share\nrepurchase activity at any time.\n\nFurthermore, the Company has a\nvariety of benefit plans in which\nemployees may own or obtain shares of\nour common stock. The Company may buy\nshares from these plans to\naccommodate employee preferences and\nthese purchases are subtracted from\nour repurchase authority.\n\nFor additional information about\nshare repurchases during third\nquarter 2024, see Part II, Item 2 in\nthis Report.\n                      \n  Regulatory Matters  \n                      \nThe U.S. financial services industry\nis subject to significant regulation\nand regulatory oversight initiatives.\nThis regulation and oversight may\ncontinue to impact how U.S. financial\nservices companies conduct business\nand may continue to result in\nincreased regulatory compliance\ncosts.\n\nFor a discussion of certain consent\norders and other regulatory actions\napplicable to the Company, see the\n\u201cOverview\u201d section in this Report.\nThe following supplements our\ndiscussion of other significant\nregulations and regulatory oversight\ninitiatives that have affected or may\naffect our business contained in the\n\u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d sections in our 2023 Form\n10-K and the \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d\nsection in our 2024 First and Second\nQuarter Reports on Form 10-Q.\n                                                                             \n  Personal Financial Data Rights                                             \n                                                                             \nIn October 2024, the CFPB issued a\nrule pursuant to section 1033 of the\nDodd-Frank Act that requires\nfinancial service providers to make\nconsumers\u2019 data available upon\nrequest to consumers and authorized\nthird parties. The compliance date\nfor the rule is April 1, 2026. The\nrule will require the Company to\nupdate its technology systems,\ncompliance, third-party risk\nmanagement programs, and digital\nchannels.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    51  \n                               \n                                \n  Critical Accounting Policies  \n                                \nOur significant accounting policies\nare fundamental to understanding our\nresults of operations and financial\ncondition because they require that\nwe use estimates and assumptions that\nmay affect the value of our assets or\nliabilities and financial results.\nSix of these policies are critical\nbecause they require management to\nmake difficult, subjective and\ncomplex judgments about matters that\nare inherently uncertain and because\nit is likely that materially\ndifferent amounts would be reported\nunder different conditions or using\ndifferent assumptions. These policies\ngovern:\n\n\u2022 the allowance for credit losses;\n\n\u2022 the valuation of residential MSRs;\n\n\u2022 the fair value of financial\ninstruments;\n\n\u2022 income taxes;\n\n\u2022 liability for legal actions; and\n\n\u2022 goodwill impairment.\n\nManagement has discussed these\ncritical accounting policies and the\nrelated estimates and judgments with\nthe Board\u2019s Audit Committee.

We\nare unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because we\nare unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate\ncalculation or estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the\nreconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in forecasting\nand quantifying future amounts or when they may occur.

Projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No\nchange occurred during third quarter 2024 that has materially affected, or is\nreasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\n

We provide\nbanking, investment and mortgage products and services, as well as consumer\nand commercial finance, through banking locations and offices, the internet\nand other distribution channels to individuals, businesses and institutions\nin all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in countries outside the U.S.\nWhen we refer to \u201cWells Fargo,\u201d \u201cthe Company,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus,\u201d we mean\nWells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells Fargo & Company\n(the Parent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding company. We\nalso hold a majority interest in a real estate investment trust, which has\npublicly traded preferred stock outstanding. Our accounting and reporting\npolicies conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)\nand practices in the financial services industry. For a discussion of our\nsignificant accounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 (2023 Form 10-K). There were no material changes to these\npolicies in the first nine months of 2024. To prepare the financial\nstatements in conformity with GAAP, management must make estimates based on\nassumptions about future economic and market conditions (for example,\nunemployment, market liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements, income and expenses during the reporting period and the related\ndisclosures. Although our estimates contemplate current conditions and how we\nexpect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual\nconditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, which could\nmaterially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nManagement has made significant estimates in several areas, including: \u2022\nallowance for credit losses (Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit\nLosses) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt\nSecurities)); \u2022 valuations of residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)\n(Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 13 (Securitizations and\nVariable Interest Entities)); \u2022 valuations of financial instruments (Note 12\n(Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities)); \u2022 liability for legal actions (Note\n10 (Legal Actions)); \u2022 income taxes; and \u2022 goodwill impairment (Note 7\n(Intangible Assets and Other Assets)). Actual results could differ from those\nestimates. These unaudited interim financial statements reflect all\nadjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair\nstatement of the results for the periods presented. These adjustments are of\na normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed in this Form 10-Q. The\nresults of operations in the interim financial statements do not necessarily\nindicate the results that may be expected for the full year. The interim\nfinancial information should be read in conjunction with our 2023 Form 10-K.\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2024 In 2024, we adopted the following new\naccounting guidance: \u2022 Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-02, Investments\n\u2013 Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in\nTax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method \u2022 ASU\n2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity\nSecurities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions ASU 2023-02 expands the\nuse of the proportional amortization method of accounting for tax credit\ninvestments, which previously was limited to affordable housing investments\nthat generate low-income housing tax credits. Upon adoption of the Update, an\nentity may elect to account for equity investments that generate income tax\ncredits and benefits using the proportional amortization method if certain\neligibility criteria are met. The proportional amortization method amortizes\nthe cost of a tax credit investment in proportion to the income tax credits\nand income tax benefits received. The amortization and related income tax\ncredits and benefits are recorded on a net basis within income tax expense.\nThe cost of an investment includes unfunded commitments that are either\nlegally binding or contingent but probable of funding. Such unfunded\ncommitments are not recognized under other methods of accounting. We adopted\nthe Update on January 1, 2024, on a modified retrospective basis with a\ncumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. Upon adoption, we elected\nto account for eligible investments in our renewable energy tax credit\nportfolio using the proportional amortization method. These investments were\npreviously accounted for using the equity method. We also elected to continue\nuse of the proportional amortization method to account for our affordable\nhousing investments. In addition, we elected to classify liabilities\nrecognized for unfunded commitments related to proportional amortization\nmethod investments in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheet, including a change to unfunded commitments for\naffordable housing investments that were previously included in long-term\ndebt.

The credit quality indicators\nthat we most closely monitor include credit ratings and delinquency status\nand are based on information as of our financial statement date. CREDIT\nRATINGS Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a debt\nsecurity. We determine the credit rating of a security according to the\nlowest credit rating made available by national recognized statistical rating\norganizations (NRSROs). Debt securities rated investment grade, that is those\nwith ratings similar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as defined by NRSROs, are\ngenerally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low\ncredit risk. Conversely, debt securities rated below investment grade,\nlabeled as \u201cspeculative grade\u201d by the rating agencies, are considered to be\ndistinctively higher credit risk than investment grade debt securities. For\ndebt securities not rated by NRSROs, we determine an internal credit grade of\nthe debt securities (used for credit risk management purposes) equivalent to\nthe credit ratings assigned by major credit agencies. Substantially all of\nour debt securities were rated by NRSROs at September 30, 2024, and December\n31, 2023.

recognition of credit losses. As such, as part\nof our monitoring of the credit quality of the debt security portfolio, we\nconsider whether debt securities we own are past due in payment of principal\nor interest payments and whether any securities have been placed into\nnonaccrual status. Debt securities that are past due and still accruing or in\nnonaccrual status were insignificant at both September 30, 2024, and December\n31, 2023. Net charge-offs on debt securities were insignificant in the third\nquarter and first nine months of both 2024 and 2023.\n                               \n  68    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nUnrealized Losses of Available-for-Sale Debt Securities Table 3.5 shows the\ngross unrealized losses and fair value of AFS debt securities by length of\ntime those individual securities in each category have been in a continuous\nloss position. Debt securities on which we have recorded credit impairment\nare categorized as being \u201cless than 12 months\u201d or \u201c12 months or more\u201d in a\ncontinuous loss position based on the point in time that the fair value\ndeclined to below the amortized cost basis, net of the allowance for credit\nlosses.\n\nTable 3.5: Gross Unrealized Losses and Fair Value \u2013 Available-for-Sale

portfolio level basis adjustments.\n\nWe have assessed each debt security with gross unrealized losses included in\nthe previous table for credit impairment. As part of that assessment we\nevaluated and concluded that we do not intend to sell any of the debt\nsecurities, and that it is more likely than not that we will not be required\nto sell, prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. We evaluate, where\nnecessary, whether credit impairment exists by comparing the present value of\nthe expected cash flows to the debt securities\u2019 amortized cost basis. Credit\nimpairment is recorded as an ACL for debt securities. For descriptions of the\nfactors we consider when analyzing debt securities for impairment as well as\nmethodology and significant inputs used to measure credit losses, see Note 1\n(Summary of

Our commercial lending\ncommitments include, but are not\nlimited to, (i) commitments for\nworking capital and general corporate\npurposes, (ii) financing to customers\nwho warehouse financial assets\nsecured by real estate, consumer, or\ncorporate loans, (iii) financing that\nis expected to be syndicated or\nreplaced with other forms of long-\nterm financing, and (iv) commercial\nreal estate lending. We also\noriginate multipurpose lending\ncommitments under which commercial\ncustomers have the option to draw on\nthe facility in one of several forms,\nincluding the issuance of letters of\ncredit, which reduces the unfunded\ncommitment amounts of the facility.\nThe maximum credit risk for these\ncommitments will generally be lower\nthan the contractual amount because\nthese commitments may expire without\nbeing used or may be cancelled at the\ncustomer\u2019s request. We may reduce or\ncancel lines of credit in accordance\nwith the contracts and applicable\nlaw. Our credit risk monitoring\nactivities include managing the\namount of commitments, both to\nindividual customers and in total,\nand the size and maturity structure\nof these commitments. We do not\nrecognize an ACL for commitments that\nare unconditionally cancellable at\nour discretion. We issue commercial\nletters of credit to assist customers\nin purchasing goods or services,\ntypically for international trade. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, and December 31,\n2023, we had $ 1.3billion and $\n1.1billion, respectively, of\noutstanding issued commercial letters\nof credit. See Note 14 (Guarantees\nand Other Commitments) for additional\ninformation on issued standby letters\nof credit.\n\nWe may be a fronting bank, whereby we\nact as a representative for other\nlenders, and advance funds or provide\nfor the issuance of letters of credit\nunder syndicated loan or letter of\ncredit agreements. Any advances are\ngenerally repaid in less than a week\nand would normally require default of\nboth the customer and another lender\nto expose us to loss.\nThe contractual amount of our\nunfunded credit commitments,\nincluding unissued letters of credit,\nis summarized in Table 5.4. The table\nis presented net of commitments\nsyndicated to others, including the\nfronting arrangements described\nabove, and excludes issued letters of\ncredit and discretionary amounts\nwhere our approval or consent is\nrequired prior to any loan funding or\ncommitment increase.\nTable 5.4: Unfunded Credit\nCommitments\n                                                                             \n                                                Sep 30,             Dec 31,  \n  (in millions)                                 2024                2023     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Commercial and industrial         $  390,539             388,043           \n  Commercial real estate                14,200              20,851           \n  Total commercial                     404,739             408,894           \n  Residential mortgage (1)              26,053              29,754           \n  Credit card                          162,975             156,012           \n  Other consumer                         8,211               8,847           \n  Total consumer                       197,239             194,613           \n  Total unfunded credit             $  601,978             603,507           \n  commitments                                                                \n                                                                             \n(1) Includes lines of credit totaling\n$ 24.2billion and $ 28.6billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, and December 31,\n2023 , respectively.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    75  \n                               \nNote 5: Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses (continued)\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses Table 5.5 presents the ACL for loans, which\nconsists of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded\ncredit commitments.

For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nCredit Quality We monitor credit quality by evaluating various attributes and\nutilize such information in our evaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL\nfor loans. The following sections provide the credit quality indicators we\nmost closely monitor. The credit quality indicators are generally based on\ninformation as of our financial statement date. COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY\nINDICATORS We manage a consistent process for assessing commercial loan\ncredit quality. Commercial loans are generally subject to individual risk\nassessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings, which\nis our primary credit quality indicator. Our ratings are aligned to\nregulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with the criticized\nsegmented among special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss categories.\nTable 5.7 provides the outstanding balances of our commercial loan portfolio\nby risk category and credit quality information by origination year for term\nloans. Revolving loans may convert to term loans as a result of a contractual\nprovision in the original loan agreement or if modified for a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty. At September 30, 2024, we had $\n493.0billion and $ 37.6billion of pass and criticized commercial loans,\nrespectively. Gross charge-offs by loan class are included in the following\ntable for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and year ended December\n31, 2023, which we monitor as part of our credit risk management practices;\nhowever, charge-offs are not a primary credit quality indicator for our loan\nportfolio.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    77  \n

Loan delinquency, Fair Isaac Corporation\n(FICO) credit scores and loan-to-value (LTV) for residential mortgage loans\nare the primary credit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in our\nevaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL for the consumer loan portfolio\nsegment. Many of our loss estimation techniques used for the ACL for loans\nrely on delinquency-based models; therefore, delinquency is an important\nindicator of credit quality in the establishment of our ACL for consumer\nloans. We obtain FICO scores at loan origination and the scores are generally\nupdated at least quarterly, except in limited circumstances, including\ncompliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). FICO scores are not\navailable for certain loan types or may not be required if we deem it\nunnecessary due to strong collateral and other borrower attributes. LTV is\nthe ratio of the outstanding loan balance divided by the property collateral\nvalue. For junior lien mortgages, we use the total combined loan balance of\nfirst and junior lien mortgages (including unused line of credit amounts). We\nobtain LTVs using a cascade approach which first uses values provided by\nautomated valuation models (AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not\navailable, then the value is estimated using the original appraised value\nadjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the property location.\nIf an HPI is not available, the original appraised value is used. The HPI\nvalue is normally the only method considered for high value properties,\ngenerally with an original value of $ 1.5million or more, as the AVM values\nhave proven less accurate for these properties. Generally, we update LTVs on\na quarterly basis. Certain loans do not have an LTV due to a lack of industry\ndata availability and portfolios acquired from or serviced by other\ninstitutions. Gross charge-offs by loan class are included in the following\ntables for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and year ended December\n31, 2023, which we monitor as part of our credit risk management practices;\nhowever, charge-offs are not a primary credit quality indicator for our loan\nportfolio. Credit quality information is provided with the year of\norigination for term loans. Revolving loans may convert to term loans as a\nresult of a contractual provision in the original loan agreement or if\nmodified for a borrower experiencing financial difficulty.

Prepayment\nspeeds are influenced by mortgage interest rates as well as our estimation of\ndrivers of borrower behavior.\nThe sensitivities in the preceding table are hypothetical and caution should\nbe exercised when relying on this data. Changes in value based on variations\nin assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of\nthe change in the assumption to the change in value may not be linear. Also,\nthe effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the value of the\nother interests held is calculated independently without changing any other\nassumptions. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in\nothers, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.\n                               \n  88    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nWe present information for our managed servicing portfolio in Table 6.3 using\nunpaid principal balance for loans serviced and subserviced for others and\ncarrying value for owned loans serviced. As the servicer of loans for others,\nwe advance certain payments of principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and\ndefault-related expenses. The credit risk related to these advances is\nlimited since the reimbursement is generally senior to cash payments to\ninvestors and are generally reimbursed within a short timeframe from cash\nflows from the trust, government- sponsored enterprise (GSEs), insurer, or\nborrower. We maintain an allowance for uncollectible amounts for advances on\nloans serviced for others that may not be reimbursed if the payments were not\nmade in accordance with applicable servicing agreements or if the insurance\nor servicing agreements contain limitations on reimbursements. We also\nadvance payments of taxes and insurance for our owned loans which are\ncollectible from the borrower. Servicing advances on owned loans are written-\noff when deemed uncollectible.\nTable 6.3: Managed Servicing Portfolio\n                                                                             \n

These\nproceedings and investigations include actions brought against Wells Fargo\nand/or our subsidiaries with respect to corporate-related matters and\ntransactions in which Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries were involved. In\naddition, Wells Fargo and our subsidiaries may be requested to provide\ninformation to or otherwise cooperate with government authorities in the\nconduct of investigations of other persons or industry groups. We establish\naccruals for legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions\nbecome probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For such accruals,\nwe record the amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of\npotential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if we cannot\ndetermine a best estimate, then we record the low end of the range of those\npotential losses. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of\nlegal actions, including the matters described below, and the actual costs of\nresolving legal actions may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts\naccrued for those actions. ADVISORY ACCOUNT CASH SWEEP MATTERS The United\nStates Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has undertaken an\ninvestigation regarding the cash sweep options that the Company provides to\ninvestment advisory clients at account opening. The Company is in resolution\ndiscussions with the SEC, although there can be no assurance as to the\noutcome of these discussions. In addition, putative class actions have been\nfiled in federal district courts alleging that the Company breached its\nfiduciary duties or agreements with regard to rates paid to clients in its\ncash sweep program. ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND ECONOMIC SANCTIONS RELATED\nINVESTIGATIONS Government authorities are conducting inquiries or\ninvestigations regarding issues related to the Company\u2019s anti-money\nlaundering and sanctions programs. On September 12, 2024, the Company\nannounced that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. entered into a formal agreement with\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) related to the bank\u2019s\nanti-money laundering and sanctions risk management practices. COMPANY 401(K)\nPLAN LITIGATION On September 26, 2022, participants in the Company\u2019s 401(k)\nplan filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for\nthe District of Minnesota alleging that the Company violated the Employee\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 in connection with certain\ntransactions associated with the Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature of the\nCompany\u2019s 401(k) plan, including the manner in which the 401(k) plan\npurchased certain securities used in connection with the Company\u2019s\ncontributions to the 401(k) plan. HIRING PRACTICES MATTERS Government\nagencies, including the United States Department of Justice and the SEC, have\nundertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations regarding the\nCompany\u2019s hiring practices related to diversity. The United States Department\nof Justice and the SEC have since closed their investigations without taking\naction. A putative securities fraud class action has also been filed in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging\nthat the Company and certain of its executive officers made false or\nmisleading statements about the Company\u2019s hiring practices related to\ndiversity. Allegations related to the Company\u2019s hiring practices related to\ndiversity are also among the subjects of a shareholder derivative lawsuit\npending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia. HOME MORTGAGE DISCRIMINATION LITIGATION Plaintiffs representing a\nclass of home mortgage applicants and customers filed putative class actions\nagainst Wells Fargo alleging that Wells Fargo\u2019s mortgage lending policies and\npractices resulted in disparate treatment and disparate impact against\nminority applicants. These actions have been consolidated in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California. INTERCHANGE\nLITIGATION Plaintiffs representing a class of merchants have filed putative\nclass actions, and individual merchants have filed individual actions,\nalleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain payment card issuing\nbanks including Wells Fargo, unlawfully colluded to set interchange rates\nassociated with Visa and Mastercard payment card transactions and that\nenforcement of certain Visa and Mastercard rules and alleged tying and\nbundling of services offered to merchants were anticompetitive. These actions\nhave been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York. Wells Fargo, along with other defendants and entities,\nare parties to loss and judgment sharing agreements, which provide that they,\nalong with other entities, will share, based on a formula, in any losses or\njudgments from the relevant litigation. In July 2012, Visa, Mastercard, and\nthe financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, agreed to pay a\ntotal of approximately $ 6.6billion in order to settle the consolidated\naction. Several merchants opted out of the settlement and are pursuing\nindividual actions. In June 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit vacated the settlement agreement and reversed and remanded the\nconsolidated action to the district court for further proceedings. In\nNovember 2016, the district court appointed lead class counsel for a damages\nclass and an equitable relief class. The parties entered into a settlement\nagreement to resolve the damages class claims pursuant to which defendants\nagreed to pay a total of approximately $ 6.2billion, which includes\napproximately $ 5.3billion of funds remaining in escrow from the 2012\nsettlement and $ 900million in additional funding. Wells Fargo\u2019s allocated\nresponsibility for the additional funding is approximately $ 94.5million. The\ncourt granted final approval of the settlement on December 13, 2019, which\nwas affirmed by the Second Circuit on March 15, 2023. On September 27, 2021,\nthe district court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification in\nthe equitable relief case. On March 26, 2024, Visa and Mastercard entered\ninto a settlement agreement to resolve the equitable relief class claims,\nwhich was denied by the district court on June 25, 2024. Some of the opt-out\nand direct-action cases have been settled while others remain pending. RMBS\nTRUSTEE LITIGATION In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF Limited (Phoenix Light)\nand certain related entities filed a complaint in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York alleging claims against Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential\nmortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts.

In each case, the\nplaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses\nto investors, and plaintiffs assert\ncauses of action based upon, among\nother things, the trustee\u2019s alleged\nfailure to notify and enforce\nrepurchase obligations of mortgage\nloan sellers for purported breaches\nof representations and warranties,\nnotify investors of alleged events of\ndefault, and abide by appropriate\nstandards of care following alleged\nevents of default. In July 2022, the\ndistrict court dismissed Phoenix\nLight\u2019s claims and certain of the\nclaims asserted by Commerzbank AG,\nand subsequently entered judgment in\neach case in favor of Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix\nLight and Commerzbank AG each\nappealed the district court\u2019s\ndecision to the United States Court\nof Appeals for the Second Circuit.\nPhoenix Light dismissed its appeal in\nMay 2023, terminating its case. In\nOctober 2024, the Second Circuit\ndenied Commerzbank AG\u2019s appeal. In\nNovember 2023, the Company entered\ninto an agreement with IKB to resolve\nIKB\u2019s claims. The Company previously\nsettled twoclass actions filed by\ninstitutional investors and an action\nfiled by the National Credit Union\nAdministration with similar\nallegations. SEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE\nLITIGATION The Seminole Tribe of\nFlorida filed a complaint in Florida\nstate court alleging that Wells\nFargo, as trustee, charged excess\nfees in connection with the\nadministration of a minor\u2019s trust and\nfailed to invest the assets of the\ntrust prudently. The complaint was\nlater amended to include\nthreeindividual current and former\nbeneficiaries as plaintiffs and to\nremove the Tribe as a party to the\ncase. ZELLE INVESTIGATION The\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau\nhas been conducting an investigation\nregarding the handling of customer\ndisputes related to fund transfers\nmade through the Zelle Network.\n\nOUTLOOK As described above, the\nCompany establishes accruals for\nlegal actions when potential losses\nassociated with the actions become\nprobable and the costs can be\nreasonably estimated. The high end of\nthe range of reasonably possible\nlosses in excess of the Company\u2019s\naccrual for probable and estimable\nlosses was approximately $ 2.0billion\nas of September 30, 2024. The\noutcomes of legal actions are\nunpredictable and subject to\nsignificant uncertainties, and it is\ninherently difficult to determine\nwhether any loss is probable or even\npossible. It is also inherently\ndifficult to estimate the amount of\nany loss and there may be matters for\nwhich a loss is probable or\nreasonably possible but not currently\nestimable. Accordingly, actual losses\nmay be in excess of the established\naccrual or the range of reasonably\npossible loss. Based on information\ncurrently available, advice of\ncounsel, available insurance\ncoverage, and established reserves,\nWells Fargo believes that the\neventual outcome of the actions\nagainst Wells Fargo and/or its\nsubsidiaries will not, individually\nor in the aggregate, have a material\nadverse effect on Wells Fargo\u2019s\nconsolidated financial condition.\nHowever, it is possible that the\nultimate resolution of a matter, if\nunfavorable, may be material to Wells\nFargo\u2019s results of operations for any\nparticular period.\n                               \n  94    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \n                       \n  Note 11:Derivatives  \n                       \nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including interest rate\nrisk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to assist customers with\ntheir risk management objectives.

Where legally enforceable,\nthese master netting arrangements give the ability, in the event of default\nby the counterparty, to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset\nreceivables and payables with the same counterparty. We reflect all\nderivative balances and related cash collateral subject to enforceable master\nnetting arrangements on a net basis on our consolidated balance sheet. We do\nnot net non-cash collateral that we receive or pledge against derivative\nbalances on our consolidated balance sheet. For disclosure purposes, we\npresent \u201cTotal Derivatives, net\u201d which represents the aggregate of our net\nexposure to each counterparty after considering the balance sheet netting\nadjustments and any non-cash collateral. We manage derivative exposure by\nmonitoring the credit risk associated with each counterparty using\ncounterparty-specific credit risk limits, using master netting arrangements\nand obtaining collateral. Table 11.2 provides information on the fair values\nof derivative assets and liabilities subject to enforceable master netting\narrangements, the balance sheet netting adjustments and the resulting net\nfair value amount recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as the\nnon-cash collateral associated with such arrangements. In addition to the\nnetting amounts included in the table, we also have balance sheet netting\nrelated to resale and repurchase agreements that are disclosed within Note 15\n(Securities and Other Collateralized Financing Activities).\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    95  \n                               \n

We also enter into cross-currency swaps, cross-currency interest\nrate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency\nrisk and interest rate risk associated with the issuance of non-U.S. dollar\ndenominated long-term debt. We also enter into futures contracts, forward\ncontracts, and swap contracts to hedge our exposure to the price risk of\nphysical commodities included in other assets on our consolidated balance\nsheet. In addition, we use interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, cross-\ncurrency interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge against changes\nin fair value of certain investments in AFS debt securities due to changes in\ninterest rates, foreign currency rates, or both. For certain fair value\nhedges of interest rate risk, we use the portfolio layer method to hedge\nstated amounts of closed portfolios of AFS debt securities. For certain fair\nvalue hedges of foreign currency risk, changes in fair value of cross-\ncurrency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency basis spreads are\nexcluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded in other\ncomprehensive income (OCI). See Note 21 (Other Comprehensive Income) for the\namounts recognized in other comprehensive income. For cash flow hedges, we\nuse interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest payments\nreceived on certain interest-earning deposits with banks and certain\nfloating-rate commercial loans. We also use cross-currency swaps to hedge\nvariability in interest payments on fixed-rate foreign currency-denominated\nlong-term debt due to changes in foreign exchange rates. We estimate $\n359million pre-tax of deferred net losses related to cash flow hedges in OCI\nat September 30, 2024, will be reclassified into net interest income during\nthe next twelve months. For cash flow hedges as of September 30, 2024, we are\nhedging our interest rate and foreign currency exposure to the variability of\nfuture cash flows for all forecasted transactions for a maximum of\napproximately 8years. For additional information on our accounting hedges,\nsee Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in our 2023 Form\n10-K.

We generally use credit\nderivatives to assist customers with\ntheir risk management objectives by\npurchasing and selling credit\nprotection on corporate debt\nobligations through the use of credit\ndefault swaps or through risk\nparticipation swaps to help manage\ncounterparty exposure. We would be\nrequired to perform under the credit\nderivatives we sold in the event of\ndefault by the referenced obligors.\nEvents of default include events such\nas bankruptcy, capital restructuring\nor lack of principal and/or interest\npayment.

Assets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value on a recurring\nbasis, such as derivatives,\nresidential MSRs, and trading or AFS\ndebt securities, are presented in\nTable 12.1 in this Note.\nAdditionally, from time to time, we\nrecord fair value adjustments on a\nnonrecurring basis. These\nnonrecurring adjustments typically\ninvolve application of lower of cost\nor fair value (LOCOM) accounting,\nwrite-downs of individual assets or\napplication of the measurement\nalternative for nonmarketable equity\nsecurities. Assets recorded at fair\nvalue on a nonrecurring basis are\npresented in Table 12.4 in this Note.\nWe provide in Table 12.9 estimates of\nfair value for financial instruments\nthat are not recorded at fair value,\nsuch as loans and debt liabilities\ncarried at amortized cost. See Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies) in our 2023 Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of how we determine fair\nvalue. For descriptions of the\nvaluation methodologies we use for\nassets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value on a recurring or\nnonrecurring basis, see Note 15 (\nFair Values of Assets and\nLiabilities) in our 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY We classify our\nassets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value as either Level 1, 2, or 3\nin the fair value hierarchy. The\nhighest priority (Level 1) is\nassigned to valuations based on\nunadjusted quoted prices in active\nmarkets and the lowest priority\n(Level 3) is assigned to valuations\nbased on significant unobservable\ninputs. See Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) in\nour 2023 Form 10-K for a detailed\ndescription of the fair value\nhierarchy. In the determination of\nthe classification of financial\ninstruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy, we consider\nall available information, including\nobservable market data, indications\nof market liquidity and orderliness,\nand our understanding of the\nvaluation techniques and significant\ninputs used. This determination is\nultimately based upon the specific\nfacts and circumstances of each\ninstrument or instrument category and\njudgments are made regarding the\nsignificance of the unobservable\ninputs to the instruments\u2019 fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety. If\nunobservable inputs are considered\nsignificant, the instrument is\nclassified as Level 3. We do not\nclassify nonmarketable equity\nsecurities in the fair value\nhierarchy if we use the non-published\nnet asset value (NAV) per share (or\nits equivalent) as a practical\nexpedient to measure fair value.\nMarketable equity securities with\npublished NAVs are classified in the\nfair value hierarchy.\n                                \n  102    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nAssets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Table 12.1\npresents the balances of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a\nrecurring basis.

principally by\ndetermining the change in fair value\nof the loans due to changes in the\nobservable or implied credit spread.\nCredit spread is the market yield on\nthe loans less the relevant risk-free\nbenchmark interest rate. For\nnonperforming loans, we attribute all\nchanges in fair value to instrument-\nspecific credit risk. For LHFS\naccounted for under the fair value\noption, instrument-specific credit\ngains or losses were insignificant\nduring the third quarter and first\nnine months of both 2024 and 2023.\n\nFor interest-bearing deposits and\nlong-term debt, instrument-specific\ncredit risk gains or losses represent\nthe impact of changes in fair value\ndue to changes in our credit spread\nand are generally derived using\nobservable secondary bond market\ninformation. These impacts are\nrecorded within the debit valuation\nadjustments (DVA) in OCI. See Note 21\n(Other Comprehensive Income) for\nadditional information.\n                                \n  108    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nDisclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments Table 12.9 presents a\nsummary of fair value estimates for financial instruments that are not\ncarried at fair value on a recurring basis. Some financial instruments are\nexcluded from the scope of this table, such as certain insurance contracts,\ncertain nonmarketable equity securities, and leases. This table also excludes\nassets and liabilities that are not financial instruments such as the value\nof the long-term relationships with our deposit, credit card and trust\ncustomers, MSRs, premises and equipment, goodwill and deferred taxes. Loan\ncommitments, standby letters of credit and commercial and similar letters of\ncredit are not included in Table 12.9. A reasonable estimate of the fair\nvalue of these instruments is the carrying value of deferred fees plus the\nallowance for unfunded credit commitments, which totaled $ 505million and $\n575million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The\ntotal of the fair value calculations presented does not represent, and should\nnot be construed to represent, the underlying fair value of the Company.\n\nTable 12.9: Fair Value Estimates for

Entities (VIEs) In the normal course of\nbusiness, we enter into various types of on- and off-balance sheet\ntransactions with special purpose entities (SPEs), which are corporations,\ntrusts, limited liability companies or partnerships that are established for\na limited purpose. SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization\ntransactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE. SPEs formed\nin connection with securitization transactions are generally considered\nvariable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE may alter the risk profile of the\nasset by entering into derivative transactions or obtaining credit support,\nand issues various forms of interests in those assets to investors. When we\ntransfer financial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in\nconnection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and sometimes\nother interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets we transfer. In certain\ntransactions with VIEs, we may retain the right to service the transferred\nassets and repurchase the transferred assets if the outstanding balance of\nthe assets falls below the level at which the cost to service the assets\nexceed the benefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans\ntransferred to a VIE by a third party. In connection with our securitization\nor other VIE activities, we have various forms of ongoing involvement with\nVIEs, which may include: \u2022 underwriting securities issued by VIEs and\nsubsequently making markets in those securities; \u2022 providing credit\nenhancement on securities issued by VIEs through the use of letters of credit\nor financial guarantees; \u2022 entering into other derivative contracts with\nVIEs; \u2022 holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs; \u2022 acting as\nservicer or investment manager for VIEs; \u2022 providing administrative or\ntrustee services to VIEs; and \u2022 providing seller financing to VIEs. Loan\nSales and Securitization Activity We periodically transfer consumer and\ncommercial loans and other types of financial assets in securitization and\nwhole loan sale transactions. MORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO GOVERNMENT SPONSORED\nENTERPRISES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE In the normal course of business\nwe sell residential and commercial mortgage loans to GSEs. These loans are\ngenerally transferred into securitizations sponsored by the GSEs, which\nprovide certain credit guarantees to investors and servicers. We also\ntransfer mortgage loans into securitization pools pursuant to Government\nNational Mortgage Association (GNMA) guidelines which are insured by the FHA\nor guaranteed by the VA. Mortgage loans eligible for securitization with the\nGSEs or GNMA are considered conforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA design the\nstructure of these securitizations, sponsor the involved VIEs, and have power\nover the activities most significant to the VIE. We account for loans\ntransferred in conforming mortgage loan securitization transactions as sales\nand do not consolidate the VIEs as we are not the primary beneficiary. In\nexchange for the transfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by\nthe VIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for investment\npurposes as HTM or AFS securities. We also retain servicing rights on the\ntransferred loans. As a servicer, we retain the option to repurchase loans\nfrom certain loan securitizations, which becomes exercisable based on\ndelinquency status such as when three scheduled loan payments are past due.\nWhen we have the unilateral option to repurchase a loan, we recognize the\nloan and a corresponding liability on our balance sheet regardless of our\nintent to repurchase the loan, and the loans remain pledged to the\nsecuritization. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we recorded\nassets and related liabilities of $ 1.3billion and $ 1.0billion,\nrespectively, where we did not exercise our option to repurchase eligible\nloans. We repurchased loans of $ 14million and $ 122million, during the third\nquarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and $ 49million and $\n240million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2023,\nrespectively. Upon transfers of loans, we also provide indemnification for\nlosses incurred due to material breaches of contractual representations and\nwarranties as well as other recourse arrangements. At September 30, 2024, and\nDecember 31, 2023, our liability for these repurchase and recourse\narrangements was $ 194million and $ 229million, respectively, and the maximum\nexposure to loss was $ 13.7billion and $ 13.6billion at September 30, 2024,\nand December 31, 2023, respectively. Substantially all residential servicing\nactivity is related to assets transferred to GSE and GNMA securitizations.\nSee Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information about\nresidential and commercial servicing rights, advances and servicing fees.\nNONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS In the normal course of business,\nwe sell nonconforming mortgage loans in securitization transactions that we\ndesign and sponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations do not\ninvolve a government credit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial interest\nholders are subject to credit risk of the underlying assets held by the\nsecuritization VIE. We typically originate the transferred loans and account\nfor the transfers as sales. We also typically retain the right to service the\nloans and may hold other beneficial interests issued by the VIE, such as debt\nsecurities held for investment purposes. Our servicing role related to\nnonconforming commercial mortgage loan securitizations is limited to primary\nor master servicer. We do not consolidate the VIE because the most\nsignificant decisions impacting the performance of the VIE are generally made\nby the special servicer or the controlling class security holder. For our\nresidential nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations accounted for as\nsales, we either do not hold variable interests that we consider potentially\nsignificant or are not the primary servicer for a majority of the VIE assets.\nWHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We may also sell whole loans to VIEs where we\nhave continuing involvement in the form of financing. We account for these\ntransfers as sales, and do not consolidate the VIEs as we do not have the\npower to direct the most significant activities of the VIEs. Table 13.1\npresents information about transfers of assets during the periods presented\nfor which we recorded the transfers as sales and have continuing involvement\nwith the transferred assets. In connection with these transfers, we received\nproceeds and recorded servicing assets and securities. Each of these\ninterests are initially measured at fair value. Servicing rights are\nclassified as Level 3 measurements, and generally securities are classified\nas Level 2. Transfers of residential mortgage loans are transactions with the\nGSEs or GNMA and generally result in nogain or loss because the loans are\ntypically measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Transfers of\ncommercial mortgage loans\n                                \n  110    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \ninclude both transactions with the GSEs or GNMA and nonconforming\ntransactions. These commercial mortgage loans are carried at the lower of\ncost or market, and we recognize gains on such transfers when the market\nvalue is greater than the carrying value of the loan when it is sold.\n\nTable 13.1: Transfers with Continuing Involvement\n                                                                             \n  (in

In resecuritization transactions, we\ntransfer trading debt securities to VIEs in exchange for new beneficial\ninterests that are sold to third parties at or shortly after securitization\nsettlement. This activity is performed for customers seeking a specific\nreturn or risk profile. Substantially all of our transactions involve the\nresecuritization of conforming mortgage-backed securities issued by the GSEs\nor guaranteed by GNMA. We do not consolidate the resecuritization VIEs as we\nshare in the decision-making power with third parties and do not hold\nsignificant economic interests in the VIEs other than for market-making\nactivities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we\ntransferred trading debt securities of $ 6.4billion and $ 10.6billion,\nrespectively, to resecuritization VIEs, and retained trading debt securities\nof $ 418million and $ 284million, respectively. These amounts are not\nincluded in Table 13.1. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we\nheld $ 711million and $ 984million of trading debt securities, respectively.\nTotal resecuritization VIE assets, to which we sold assets and hold an\ninterest, were $ 44.6billion and $ 52.0billion at September 30, 2024, and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. Total resecuritization VIE assets were $\n107.1billion and $ 110.4billion at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    111  \n                                \nNote 13: Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities (continued)\n\nSold or Securitized Loans Serviced for Others Table 13.3 presents information\nabout loans that we have originated and sold or securitized in which we have\nongoing involvement as servicer. For loans sold or securitized where\nservicing is our only form of continuing involvement, we generally experience\na loss only if we were required to repurchase a delinquent loan or foreclosed\nasset due to a breach in representations and warranties associated with our\nloan sale or servicing contracts.

For additional information about these VIEs, see the \u201cLoan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity\u201d section within this Note. Nonconforming mortgage\nloan securitizations also include commercial mortgage loan securitizations\nsponsored by third parties where we did not originate or transfer the loans\nbut serve as master servicer and invest in securities that could be\npotentially significant to the VIE. Conforming loan securitization and\nresecuritization transactions involving the GSEs and GNMA are excluded from\nTable 13.4 because we are not the sponsor or we do not have power over the\nactivities most significant to the VIEs. Additionally, due to the nature of\nthe guarantees provided by the GSEs and the FHA and VA, our credit risk\nassociated with these VIEs is limited. For additional information about\nconforming mortgage loan securitizations and resecuritizations, see the \u201cLoan\nSales and Securitization Activity\u201d and \u201cResecuritization Activities\u201d sections\nwithin this Note. COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS We may transfer purchased\nindustrial development bonds and GSE credit enhancements to VIEs in exchange\nfor beneficial interests. We may also acquire such beneficial interests in\ntransactions where we do not act as a transferor. We own all of the\nbeneficial interests and may also service the underlying mortgages that serve\nas collateral to the bonds. The GSEs have the power to direct the servicing\nand workout activities of the VIE in the event of a default, therefore we do\nnot have control over the key decisions of the VIEs. OTHER VIE STRUCTURES We\nengage in various forms of structured finance arrangements with other VIEs,\nincluding asset-backed finance structures and other securitizations\ncollateralized by asset classes other than mortgages. Collateral may include\nrental properties, asset-backed securities, student loans and mortgage loans.\nWe may participate in structuring or marketing the arrangements as well as\nprovide financing, service one or more of the underlying assets, or enter\ninto derivatives with the VIEs. We may also receive fees for those services.\nWe are not the primary beneficiary of these structures because we do not have\npower to direct the most significant activities of the VIEs.\n                                \n  112    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nTable 13.4 provides a summary of our exposure to the unconsolidated VIEs\ndescribed above, which includes investments in securities, loans, guarantees,\nliquidity agreements, commitments and certain derivatives. We exclude certain\ntransactions with unconsolidated VIEs when our continuing involvement is\ntemporary or administrative in nature or insignificant in size. In Table\n13.4, \u201cTotal VIE assets\u201d represents the remaining principal balance of assets\nheld by unconsolidated VIEs using the most current information available.\n\u201cCarrying value\u201d is the amount in our consolidated balance sheet related to\nour involvement with the unconsolidated VIEs. \u201cMaximum exposure to loss\u201d is\ndetermined as the carrying value of our investment in the VIEs excluding the\nunconditional repurchase options that have not been exercised, plus the\nremaining undrawn liquidity and lending commitments, the notional amount of\nnet written derivative contracts, and generally the notional amount of, or\nstressed loss estimate for, other commitments and guarantees. Debt,\nguarantees and other commitments include amounts related to lending\narrangements, liquidity agreements, and certain loss sharing obligations\nassociated with loans originated, sold, and serviced under certain GSE\nprograms. \u201cMaximum exposure to loss\u201d represents estimated loss that would be\nincurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances, for which we believe the\npossibility is extremely remote, such as where the value of our interests and\nany associated collateral declines to zero, without any consideration of\nrecovery or offset from any economic hedges. Accordingly, this disclosure is\nnot an indication of expected loss.\nTable 13.4: Unconsolidated VIEs\n                                                                             \n  \u2026

Entities (continued)\n\nINVOLVEMENT WITH TAX CREDIT VIES In addition to the unconsolidated VIEs in\nTable 13.4, we may invest in or provide funding to affordable housing,\nrenewable energy or similar projects that are designed to generate a return\nprimarily through the realization of federal income tax credits and other\nincome tax benefits. Our affordable housing investments generate low-income\nhousing tax credits and our renewable energy investments generate either\nproduction tax credits, investment tax credits, or both. The projects are\ntypically managed by third-party sponsors who have the power over the VIE\u2019s\nassets; therefore, we do not consolidate the VIEs. The carrying value of our\nequity investments in tax credit VIEs was $ 21.0billion and $ 19.7billion at\nSeptember 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Additionally, we had\nloans to tax credit VIEs with a carrying value of $ 2.0billion and $\n2.1billion at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our\nmaximum exposure to loss for tax credit VIEs at September 30, 2024, and\nDecember 31, 2023, was $ 29.0billion and $ 30.6billion, respectively. Our\nmaximum exposure to loss included total unfunded equity and lending\ncommitments of $ 6.1billion and $ 8.7billion at September 30, 2024, and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. Under these commitments, we are required to\nprovide additional financial support during the investment period, at the\ndiscretion of project sponsors, or for certain renewable energy investments,\non a contingent basis based on the amount of income tax credits earned. For\nequity investments accounted for using the proportional amortization method,\na liability is recognized for unfunded commitments that are either legally\nbinding or contingent but probable of funding. The liability recognized for\nthese commitments at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was $\n6.7billion and $ 4.9billion, respectively. Substantially all of these\ncommitments are expected to be funded within three years. See Note 1 (Summary\nof Significant Accounting Policies) for additional information on our\nadoption of ASU 2023-02 effective January 1, 2024, which impacted the\naccounting for our tax credit equity investments and related unfunded\ncommitments. See also Note 14 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) for\nadditional information about unrecognized commitments to purchase equity\nsecurities.

Prior period\nbalances in this table do not reflect accounting changes related to our\nadoption of ASU 2023-02 , effective January 1, 2024. For additional\ninformation, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).\n\n(2) The balance predominantly relates to equity method losses from renewable\nenergy tax credit investments, which are recorded in other noninterest income\non our consolidated statement of income.\n                                \n  114    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nConsolidated VIEs We consolidate VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary.\nWe are the primary beneficiary of the following structure types: COMMERCIAL\nAND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASES We previously securitized dealer floor plan\nloans in a revolving master trust entity. As servicer and holder of all\nbeneficial interests, we control the key decisions of the trust and\nconsolidate the VIE. In first quarter 2024, we removed the loans held by the\nmaster trust entity by transferring them to another subsidiary of Wells\nFargo, which had no impact on our consolidated balance sheet. In a separate\ntransaction structure, we may provide the majority of debt and equity\nfinancing to an SPE that engages in lending and leasing to specific vendors\nand we service the underlying collateral. CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS\nBeginning in first quarter 2024, we securitized a portion of our credit card\nloans to provide a source of funding. Credit card securitizations involve the\ntransfer of credit card loans to a master trust that issues debt securities\nto third party investors that are collateralized by the transferred credit\ncard loans. The underlying securitized credit card loans and other assets in\nthe master trust are available only for payment of the debt securities issued\nby the master trust; they are not available to pay our other obligations. In\naddition, the investors in the debt securities do not have recourse to the\ngeneral credit of Wells Fargo. We consolidate the master trust because, as\nthe servicer of the credit card loans, we have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the economic performance and hold\nvariable interests potentially significant to the VIE. We hold a minimum of\n5% seller\u2019s interest in the transferred credit card loans and we retain\nsubordinated securities issued by the master trust, which collectively could\nresult in exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits from the\nmaster trust. As of September 30, 2024, we held seller\u2019s interest of $\n7.1billion in the transferred credit card loans and subordinated securities\nof $ 750million (at par) issued by the master trust, which are both\neliminated in our consolidated financial statements. The transferred credit\ncard loans and debt securities issued to third parties are recognized on our\nconsolidated balance sheet, and classified as loans and long-term debt,\nrespectively. Table 13.6 presents a summary of financial assets and\nliabilities of our consolidated VIEs. The carrying value represents assets\nand liabilities recognized on our consolidated balance sheet. \u201cTotal VIE\nassets\u201d includes affiliate balances that are eliminated upon consolidation,\nand therefore in some instances will differ from the carrying value of\nassets. On our consolidated balance sheet, we separately disclose (1) the\nconsolidated assets of certain VIEs that can only be used to settle the\nliabilities of those VIEs, and (2) the consolidated liabilities of certain\nVIEs for which the VIE creditors do not have recourse to Wells Fargo.\n\nTable 13.6: Transactions with Consolidated VIEs\n                                                                             \n  (in                      Carr\u2026                                       Acc\u2026  \n  mi\u2026                      value               All                     exp\u2026  \n  Se\u2026              Tot\u2026        \u2013               other                    and  \n  30,              VIE     asset               asse\u2026          Long\u2026    oth\u2026  \n  20\u2026              ass\u2026    (lia\u2026  Loa\u2026         (1)            debt     lia\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Co\u2026                                                                        \n  and                                                                        \n  in\u2026    $  1,681          1,504          177              \u2014           -125  \n  lo\u2026                                                                        \n  and                                                                        \n  le\u2026                                                                        \n  Cr\u2026                                                                        \n  ca\u2026       9,387          9,241           16           -1,\u2026             -3  \n  se\u2026                                                                        \n  Ot\u2026         350              \u2014          349              \u2014              \u2014  \n  To\u2026                                                                        \n  co\u2026    $  11,4\u2026          10,7\u2026          542           -1,\u2026           -128  \n  VI\u2026                                                                        \n  De\u2026                                                                        \n  31,                                                                        \n  20\u2026                                                                        \n  Co\u2026                                                                        \n  and                                                                        \n  in\u2026    $  7,579          4,880          203              \u2014           -115  \n  lo\u2026                                                                        \n  and                                                                        \n  le\u2026                                                                        \n  Cr\u2026                                                                        \n  ca\u2026           \u2014              \u2014            \u2014              \u2014              \u2014  \n  se\u2026                                                                        \n  Ot\u2026         232              \u2014          232              \u2014              \u2014  \n  To\u2026                                                                        \n  co\u2026    $  7,811          4,880          435              \u2014           -115  \n  VI\u2026                                                                        \n                                                                             \n(1) All other assets includes loans\nheld for sale and other assets.\n\nOther Transactions In addition to the\ntransactions included in the previous\ntables, we have used wholly-owned\ntrust preferred security VIEs to\nissue debt securities or preferred\nequity exclusively to third-party\ninvestors.

possibility, where the value of our interests and any associated\ncollateral declines to zero. Maximum exposure to loss estimates in Table 14.1\ndo not reflect economic hedges or collateral we could use to offset or\nrecover losses we may incur under our guarantee agreements. Accordingly,\nthese amounts are not an indication of expected loss. We believe the carrying\nvalue is more representative of our current exposure to loss than maximum\nexposure to loss. The carrying value represents the fair value of the\nguarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL for guarantees, if applicable. In\ndetermining the ACL for guarantees, we consider the credit risk of the\nrelated contingent obligation. For our guarantees in Table 14.1, non-\ninvestment grade represents those guarantees on which we have a higher risk\nof performance under the terms of the guarantee, which is determined based on\nan external rating or an internal credit grade that is below investment\ngrade, if applicable. WRITTEN OPTIONS We enter into written foreign currency\noptions and over-the-counter written equity put options that are derivative\ncontracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee. The fair value of\nwritten options represents our view of the probability that we will be\nrequired to perform under the contract. The fair value of these written\noptions was an asset of $ 385million and $ 178million at September 30, 2024,\nand December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair value may be an asset as a\nresult of deferred premiums on certain option trades. The maximum exposure to\nloss represents the notional value of these derivative contracts. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, the maximum exposure to loss was $ 33.3billion, with $\n30.7billion expiring in three years or less compared with $ 34.0billion and $\n31.9billion, respectively, at December 31, 2023. See Note 11 (Derivatives)\nfor additional information regarding written derivative contracts. MERCHANT\nPROCESSING SERVICES We provide debit and credit card transaction processing\nservices through payment networks directly for merchants and as a sponsor for\nmerchant processing servicers, including our joint venture with a third party\nthat is accounted for as an equity method investment. In our role as the\nmerchant acquiring bank, we have a potential obligation in connection with\npayment and delivery disputes between the merchant and the cardholder that\nare resolved in favor of the cardholder, referred to as a charge-back\ntransaction. We estimate our potential maximum exposure to be the total\nmerchant transaction volume processed in the preceding four months, which is\ngenerally the lifecycle for a charge-back transaction. As of September 30,\n2024, our potential maximum exposure was approximately $ 597.4billion, and\nrelated losses, including those from our joint venture entity, were\ninsignificant. GUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES The Parent fully and\nunconditionally guarantees the payment of principal, interest, and any other\namounts that may be due on securities that its 100% owned finance subsidiary,\nWells Fargo Finance LLC, may issue.These securities are not guaranteed by any\nother subsidiary of the Parent. The guaranteed liabilities were $ 1.3billion\nand $ 834million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThese guarantees rank on parity with all of the Parent\u2019s other unsecured and\nunsubordinated indebtedness. OTHER COMMITMENTS As of September 30, 2024, and\nDecember 31, 2023, we had commitments to purchase equity securities of $\n6.7billion and $ 9.2billion, respectively, which predominantly included\nFederal Reserve Bank stock and tax credit investments accounted for using the\nequity method. As part of maintaining our memberships in certain clearing\norganizations, we are required to stand ready to provide liquidity to sustain\nmarket clearing activity in the event unforeseen events occur or are deemed\nlikely to occur. Certain of these\n                                \n  116    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nobligations are guarantees of other\nmembers\u2019 performance and accordingly\nare included in Table 14.1 in Other\nguarantees and indemnifications. We\nhave commitments to enter into resale\nand securities borrowing agreements\nas well as repurchase and securities\nlending agreements with certain\ncounterparties, including central\nclearing organizations. The amount of\nour unfunded contractual commitments\nfor resale and securities borrowing\nagreements was $ 23.2billion and $\n17.5billion as of September 30, 2024,\nand December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe amount of our unfunded\ncontractual commitments for\nrepurchase and securities lending\nagreements was $ 253million and $\n746million as of September 30, 2024,\nand December 31, 2023, respectively.\nGiven the nature of these\ncommitments, they are excluded from\nTable 5.4 (Unfunded Credit\nCommitments) in Note 5 (Loans and\nRelated Allowance for Credit Losses).\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    117  \n                                \n                                               \n  Note 15:Securities and Other Collateralized  \n  Financing Activities                         \n                                               \nWe enter into resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and\nlending agreements (collectively, \u201csecurities financing activities\u201d)\ntypically to finance trading positions (including securities and\nderivatives), acquire securities to cover short trading positions,\naccommodate customers\u2019 financing needs, and settle other securities\nobligations. These activities are conducted through our broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, through other bank entities. Our\nsecurities financing activities primarily involve high-quality, liquid\nsecurities such as U.S. Treasury securities and government agency securities\nand, to a lesser extent, less liquid securities, including equity securities,\ncorporate bonds and asset-backed securities. We account for these\ntransactions as collateralized financings in which we typically receive or\npledge securities as collateral. We believe these financing transactions\ngenerally do not have material credit risk given the collateral provided and\nthe related monitoring processes. We also enter into resale agreements\ninvolving collateral other than securities, such as loans, as part of our\ncommercial lending business activities. OFFSETTING OF SECURITIES AND OTHER\nCOLLATERALIZED FINANCING ACTIVITIES Table 15.1 presents resale and repurchase\nagreements subject to master repurchase agreements (MRA) and securities\nborrowing and lending agreements subject to master securities lending\nagreements (MSLA). Where legally enforceable, these master netting\narrangements give the ability, in the event of default by the counterparty,\nto liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and\npayables with the same counterparty. Collateralized financings with the same\ncounterparty are presented net on our consolidated balance sheet, provided\ncertain criteria are met that permit balance sheet netting. The majority of\ntransactions subject to these agreements do not meet those criteria and thus\nare not eligible for balance sheet netting. Collateral we pledged consists of\nnon-cash instruments, such as securities or loans, and is not netted on our\nconsolidated balance sheet against the related liability. Collateral we\nreceived includes securities or loans and is not recognized on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. Collateral pledged or received may be increased\nor decreased over time to maintain certain contractual thresholds, as the\nassets underlying each arrangement fluctuate in value. For additional\ninformation on collateral pledged and accepted, see Note 16 (Pledged Assets\nand Collateral). Generally, these agreements require collateral to exceed the\nasset or liability recognized on the balance sheet. The following table\nincludes the amount of collateral pledged or received related to exposures\nsubject to enforceable MRAs or MSLAs.

In these transactions, we receive cash in exchange\nfor transferring securities as collateral and recognize an obligation to\nreacquire the securities for cash at the transaction\u2019s maturity. These types\nof transactions create risks, including (1) the counterparty may fail to\nreturn the securities at maturity, (2) the fair value of the securities\ntransferred may decline below the amount of our obligation to reacquire the\nsecurities, and therefore create an obligation for us to pledge additional\namounts, and (3) the counterparty may accelerate the maturity on demand,\nrequiring us to reacquire the security prior to contractual maturity. We\nattempt to mitigate these risks in various ways. Our collateral primarily\nconsists of highly liquid securities. In addition, we underwrite and monitor\nthe financial strength of our counterparties, monitor the fair value of\ncollateral pledged relative to contractually required repurchase amounts, and\nmonitor that our collateral is properly returned through the clearing and\nsettlement process in advance of our cash repayment.

Corporate also\nincludes certain lines of business that management has determined are no\nlonger consistent with the long-term strategic goals of the Company as well\nas results for previously divested businesses. Basis of Presentation FUNDS\nTRANSFER PRICING Corporate treasury manages a funds transfer pricing\nmethodology that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other\nproduct characteristics. Operating segments pay a funding charge for their\nassets and receive a funding credit for their deposits, both of which are\nincluded in net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or\ncredits is recognized in corporate treasury. REVENUE AND EXPENSE SHARING When\nlines of business jointly serve customers, the line of business that is\nresponsible for providing the product or service recognizes revenue or\nexpense with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line\nof business based on established internal revenue-sharing agreements. When a\nline of business uses a service provided by another line of business or\nenterprise function (included in Corporate), expense is generally allocated\nbased on the cost and use of the service provided. We periodically assess and\nupdate our revenue and expense allocation methodologies. TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT\nADJUSTMENTS Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income on\ncertain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while\ntaxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for affordable\nhousing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income,\nin each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit).\nAdjustments are included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and\nInvestment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company\u2019s\nconsolidated financial results.\n

In November 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule to recover losses to the\nFDIC deposit insurance fund as a result of bank failures in the first half of\n2023. Under the rule, the FDIC will collect a special assessment based on an\ninsured depository institution\u2019s estimated amount of uninsured deposits. Upon\nthe FDIC\u2019s finalization of the rule, we expensed an estimated amount of our\nspecial assessment of $ 1.9billion (pre-tax) in fourth quarter 2023. During\n2024, the FDIC provided updates on losses to the deposit insurance fund,\nwhich resulted in a reversal of expense of $ 63million (pre-tax) in the third\nquarter of 2024 and an additional expense of $ 273million (pre-tax) in the\nfirst nine months of 2024 for the estimated amount of the special assessment.\nWe expect the ultimate amount of the special assessment may continue to\nchange as the FDIC determines the actual net losses to the deposit insurance\nfund.\n                                \n  126    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \n                             \n  Note 19:Employee Benefits  \n                             \nPension and Postretirement Plans We sponsor a frozen noncontributory\nqualified defined benefit retirement plan, the Wells Fargo & Company Cash\nBalance Plan (Cash Balance Plan), which covers eligible employees of Wells\nFargo.

The Standardized Approach\napplies assigned risk weights to broad risk categories, while the calculation\nof risk-weighted assets (RWAs) under the Advanced Approach differs by\nrequiring applicable banks to utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which\nrelies upon the use of internal credit models, and includes an operational\nrisk component.\nTable 22.1: Regulatory Capital Information\n                                                                             \n                                         \u2026                                   \n                                         \u2026                                   \n                                         &                                   \n                                         \u2026                                   \n                         \u2026               \u2026                                   \n                         \u2026               \u2026                                   \n            \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                           \n            \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                           \n            \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                             \n      $  \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                             \n         \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                             \n         \u2026  %    *    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026       *    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026       *    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                             \n         \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                         \u2026                                   \n                                         \u2026                                   \n                                         &                                   \n                                         \u2026                                   \n                         \u2026               \u2026                                   \n                         \u2026               \u2026                                   \n                         \u2026               \u2026                                   \n                                                                             \n      $               \u2026               \u2026                   \u2026             \u2026    \n                      \u2026  %            \u2026                   \u2026             \u2026    \n                      \u2026               \u2026                   \u2026             \u2026    \n                                                                             \n                      \u2026               \u2026                   \u2026             \u2026    \n                      \u2026               \u2026                   \u2026             \u2026    \n                                                                             \n* Denotes the binding ratio under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches at\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n(1) The supplementary leverage ratio consists of Tier 1 capital divided by\ntotal leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure consists of adjusted average\nassets plus certain off-balance sheet exposures. Adjusted average assets\nconsists of total quarterly average assets less goodwill and other permitted\nTier 1 capital deductions (net of deferred tax liabilities).\n(2) The Tier 1 leverage ratio consists of Tier 1 capital divided by total\nquarterly average assets, excluding goodwill and certain other items as\ndetermined under the rule.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 and Total\ncapital ratio requirements for the Company included a global systemically\nimportant bank (G-SIB) surcharge of 1.50% and a countercyclical buffer of\n0.00%. In addition, these ratios included a stress capital buffer of 2.90%\nunder the Standardized Approach and a capital conservation buffer of 2.50%\nunder the Advanced Approach. The Company is required to maintain these risk-\nbased capital ratios and to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR)\nthat included a supplementary leverage buffer of 2.00% to avoid restrictions\non capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The CET1, Tier 1\nand Total capital ratio requirements for the Bank included a capital\nconservation buffer of 2.50% under both the Standardized and Advanced\nApproaches. The G-SIB surcharge and countercyclical buffer are not applicable\nto the Bank. At September 30, 2024, the Bank and our other insured depository\ninstitutions were considered well-capitalized under the requirements of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act. Capital Planning Requirements The FRB\u2019s\ncapital plan rule establishes capital planning and other requirements that\ngovern capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, by\ncertain large bank holding companies (BHCs), including Wells Fargo. The FRB\nconducts an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review exercise and has\nalso published guidance regarding its supervisory expectations for capital\nplanning, including capital policies regarding the process relating to common\nstock dividend and repurchase decisions in the FRB\u2019s SR Letter 15-18.

Loan and\nDividend Restrictions Federal law\nrestricts the amount and the terms of\nboth credit and non-credit\ntransactions between a bank and its\nnonbank affiliates. Additionally,\nfederal laws and regulations limit,\nand regulators can impose additional\nlimitations on, the dividends that a\nnational bank may pay. Our nonbank\nsubsidiaries are also limited by\ncertain federal and state statutory\nprovisions and regulations covering\nthe amount of dividends that may be\npaid in any given year.
