Tangible book value per common share is tangible\ncommon equity divided by common shares outstanding.\n\n(4) Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents\ntotal equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill,\ncertain identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights)\nand goodwill and other intangibles on investments in consolidated portfolio\ncompanies, net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining\ntangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that\nreturn on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common\nshare, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures\nbecause they enable management, investors, and others to assess the Company\u2019s\nuse of equity.

We provide a diversified set\nof banking, investment and mortgage\nproducts and services, as well as\nconsumer and commercial finance,\nthrough our four reportable operating\nsegments: Consumer Banking and\nLending, Commercial Banking,\nCorporate and Investment Banking, and\nWealth and Investment Management.\nWells Fargo ranked No. 47 on\nFortune\u2019s 2023 rankings of America\u2019s\nlargest corporations. We ranked\nfourth in assets and third in the\nmarket value of our common stock\namong all U.S. banks at March 31,\n2024.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s top priority remains\nbuilding a risk and control\ninfrastructure appropriate for its\nsize and complexity. The Company is\nsubject to a number of consent orders\nand other regulatory actions, some of\nwhich are described below. These\nregulatory actions may require the\nCompany, among other things, to\nundertake certain changes to its\nbusiness, operations, products and\nservices, and risk management\npractices. Addressing these\nregulatory actions is expected to\ntake multiple years, and we are\nlikely to continue to experience\nissues or delays along the way in\nsatisfying their requirements. We are\nalso likely to continue to identify\nmore issues as we implement our risk\nand control infrastructure, which may\nresult in additional regulatory\nactions. Regulators have indicated\nthe potential for escalating\nconsequences for banks that do not\ntimely resolve open issues or have\nrepeat issues. Furthermore, issues or\ndelays with one regulatory action\ncould affect our progress on others.\nFailure to satisfy the requirements\nof a regulatory action on a timely\nbasis could result in additional\nfines, penalties, business\nrestrictions, limitations on\nsubsidiary capital distributions,\nincreased capital or liquidity\nrequirements, enforcement actions,\nand other adverse consequences, which\ncould be significant. While we still\nhave significant work to do and have\nnot yet satisfied certain aspects of\nthese regulatory actions, the Company\nis committed to devoting the\nresources necessary to operate with\nstrong business practices and\ncontrols, maintain the highest level\nof integrity, and have an appropriate\nculture in place.\n\nFederal Reserve Board Consent Order\nRegarding Governance Oversight and\nCompliance and Operational Risk\nManagement\n\nOn February 2, 2018, the Company\nentered into a consent order with the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (FRB). As required by\nthe consent order, the Company\u2019s\nBoard of Directors (Board) submitted\nto the FRB a plan to further enhance\nthe Board\u2019s governance and oversight\nof the Company, and the Company\nsubmitted to the FRB a plan to\nfurther improve the Company\u2019s\ncompliance and operational risk\nmanagement program. The Company\ncontinues to engage with the FRB as\nthe\n\nCompany works to address the consent\norder provisions. The consent order\nalso requires the Company, following\nthe FRB\u2019s acceptance and approval of\nthe plans and the Company\u2019s adoption\nand implementation of the plans, to\ncomplete an initial third-party\nreview of the enhancements and\nimprovements provided for in the\nplans. Until this third-party review\nis complete and the plans are adopted\nand implemented to the satisfaction\nof the FRB, the Company\u2019s total\nconsolidated assets as defined under\nthe consent order will be limited to\nthe level as of December 31, 2017.\nCompliance with this asset cap is\nmeasured on a two-quarter daily\naverage basis to allow for management\nof temporary fluctuations. After\nremoval of the asset cap, a second\nthird-party review must also be\nconducted to assess the efficacy and\nsustainability of the enhancements\nand improvements.\n\nConsent Orders with the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau and\nOffice of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency Regarding Compliance Risk\nManagement Program, Automobile\nCollateral Protection Insurance\nPolicies, and Mortgage Interest Rate\nLock Extensions\n\nOn April 20, 2018, the Company\nentered into consent orders with the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau\n(CFPB) and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (OCC) to\npay an aggregate of $1 billion in\ncivil money penalties to resolve\nmatters regarding the Company\u2019s\ncompliance risk management program\nand past practices involving certain\nautomobile collateral protection\ninsurance policies and certain\nmortgage interest rate lock\nextensions. As required by the\nconsent orders, the Company submitted\nto the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-\nwide compliance risk management plan\nand a plan to enhance the Company\u2019s\ninternal audit program with respect\nto federal consumer financial law and\nthe terms of the consent orders. In\naddition, as required by the consent\norders, the Company submitted for\nnon-objection plans to remediate\ncustomers affected by the automobile\ncollateral protection insurance and\nmortgage interest rate lock matters,\nas well as a plan for the management\nof remediation activities conducted\nby the Company. The Company continues\nto work to address the provisions of\nthe consent orders. On September 9,\n2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million\ncivil money penalty against the\nCompany related to insufficient\nprogress in addressing requirements\nunder the OCC\u2019s April 2018 consent\norder and loss mitigation activities\nin the Company\u2019s Home Lending\nbusiness. On December 20, 2022, the\nCFPB modified its consent order to\nclarify how it would terminate.\n                              \n  Wells Fargo & Company    3  \n                              \n                                                                             \n  Overview(continued)                                                        \n                                                                             \nConsent Order with the OCC Regarding\nLoss Mitigation Activities\n\nOn September 9, 2021, the Company\nentered into a consent order with the\nOCC requiring the Company to improve\nthe execution, risk management, and\noversight of loss mitigation\nactivities in its Home Lending\nbusiness. In addition, the consent\norder restricts the Company from\nacquiring certain third-party\nresidential mortgage servicing and\nlimits transfers of certain mortgage\nloans requiring customer remediation\nout of the Company\u2019s mortgage\nservicing portfolio until remediation\nis provided.\n\nConsent Order with the CFPB Regarding\nAutomobile Lending, Consumer Deposit\nAccounts, and Mortgage Lending\n\nOn December 20, 2022, the Company\nentered into a consent order with the\nCFPB requiring the Company to provide\ncustomer remediation for multiple\nmatters related to automobile\nlending, consumer deposit accounts,\nand mortgage lending; maintain\npractices designed to ensure auto\nlending customers receive refunds for\nthe unused portion of certain\nguaranteed automobile protection\nagreements; comply with certain\nbusiness practice requirements\nrelated to consumer deposit accounts;\nand pay a $1.7 billion civil penalty\nto the CFPB. The required actions\nrelated to many of these matters were\nalready substantially complete at the\ntime we entered into the consent\norder, and the consent order lays out\na path to termination after the\nCompany completes the remainder of\nthe required actions.\n                                                                             \n  Customer Remediation Activities                                            \n                                                                             \nOur work to build a better company\nhas included an effort to identify\nareas or instances where customers\nmay have experienced financial harm,\nprovide remediation as appropriate,\nand implement additional operational\nand control procedures. We are\nworking with our regulatory agencies\nin this effort.\n\nWe have accrued for the probable and\nestimable costs related to our\ncustomer remediation activities,\nwhich amounts may change based on\nadditional facts and information, as\nwell as ongoing reviews and\ncommunications with our regulators.\nWe had $1.0 billion and $819 million\nof accrued liabilities for customer\nremediation activities as of March\n31, 2024, and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. As our ongoing reviews\ncontinue and as we continue to\nstrengthen our risk and control\ninfrastructure, we have identified\nand may in the future identify\nadditional items or areas of\npotential concern. To the extent\nissues are identified, we will\ncontinue to assess any customer harm\nand provide remediation as\nappropriate.\n                                                                             \n  Recent Developments                                                        \n                                                                             \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nSpecial Assessment\n\nIn November 2023, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC)\nfinalized a rule to recover losses to\nthe FDIC deposit insurance fund as a\nresult of bank failures in the first\nhalf of 2023. Under the rule, the\nFDIC will collect a special\nassessment based on an insured\ndepository institution\u2019s estimated\namount of uninsured deposits. Upon\nthe FDIC\u2019s finalization of the rule,\nwe expensed an estimated amount of\nour special assessment of $1.9\nbillion (pre-tax) in fourth quarter\n2023. Subsequent to the filing of our\n2023 Form 10-K, the FDIC provided an\nupdate on losses to the deposit\ninsurance fund, and we expensed an\nadditional $284 million (pre-tax) in\nfirst quarter 2024 for the estimated\namount of the special assessment. We\nexpect the ultimate amount of the\nspecial assessment may continue to\nchange as the FDIC determines the\nactual net losses to the deposit\ninsurance fund.\n                                                                             \n  Overdraft Fees Proposal                                                    \n                                                                             \nOn January 17, 2024, the CFPB issued\na proposed rule that would limit\noverdraft fees charged by certain\nbanks. We expect a significant\nreduction to our overdraft fees,\nwhich are included in deposit-related\nfees, if the rule is adopted as\ncurrently proposed.\n                                                                             \n  Debit Card Interchange Fees Proposal                                       \n                                                                             \nOn October 25, 2023, the FRB issued a\nproposed rule that would reduce the\namount of debit card interchange fees\nreceived by debit card issuers. In\naddition, the proposed rule would\nallow for an update to the debit card\ninterchange fee cap every other year\nbased on an analysis of certain costs\nincurred by debit card issuers. We\nexpect a significant reduction to our\ndebit card interchange fees, which\nare included in card fees, if the\nrule is adopted as currently\nproposed.\n                              \n  4    Wells

All\nother business activities that are\nnot included in the reportable\noperating segments have been included\nin Corporate. For additional\ninformation, see Table 5 below. We\ndefine our reportable operating\nsegments by type of product and\ncustomer segment, and their results\nare based on our management reporting\nprocess. The management reporting\nprocess measures the performance of\nthe reportable operating segments\nbased on the Company\u2019s management\nstructure, and the results are\nregularly reviewed with our Chief\nExecutive Officer and relevant senior\nmanagement. The management reporting\nprocess is based on U.S. GAAP and\nincludes specific adjustments, such\nas funds transfer pricing for\nasset/liability management, shared\nrevenue and expenses, and taxable-\nequivalent adjustments to\nconsistently reflect income from\ntaxable and tax-exempt sources, which\nallows management to assess\nperformance consistently across the\noperating segments.\n\nFunds Transfer Pricing Corporate\ntreasury manages a funds transfer\npricing methodology that considers\ninterest rate risk, liquidity risk,\nand other product characteristics.\nOperating segments pay a funding\ncharge for their assets and receive a\nfunding credit for their deposits,\nboth of which are included in net\ninterest income. The net impact of\nthe funding charges or credits is\nrecognized in corporate treasury.\n\nRevenue and Expense Sharing When\nlines of business jointly serve\ncustomers, the line of business that\nis responsible for providing the\nproduct or service recognizes revenue\nor expense with a referral fee paid\nor an allocation of cost to the other\nline of\n\nbusiness based on established\ninternal revenue-sharing agreements.\n\nWhen a line of business uses a\nservice provided by another line of\nbusiness or enterprise function\n(included in Corporate), expense is\ngenerally allocated based on the cost\nand use of the service provided. We\nperiodically assess and update our\nrevenue and expense allocation\nmethodologies.\n\nTaxable-Equivalent Adjustments\nTaxable-equivalent adjustments\nrelated to tax-exempt income on\ncertain loans and debt securities are\nincluded in net interest income,\nwhile taxable-equivalent adjustments\nrelated to income tax credits for\naffordable housing and renewable\nenergy investments are included in\nnoninterest income, in each case with\ncorresponding impacts to income tax\nexpense (benefit). Adjustments are\nincluded in Corporate, Commercial\nBanking, and Corporate and Investment\nBanking and are eliminated to\nreconcile to the Company\u2019s\nconsolidated financial results.\n\nAllocated Capital Reportable\noperating segments are allocated\ncapital under a risk-sensitive\nframework that is primarily based on\naspects of our regulatory capital\nrequirements, and the assumptions and\nmethodologies used to allocate\ncapital are periodically assessed and\nupdated. Management believes that\nreturn on allocated capital is a\nuseful financial measure because it\nenables management, investors, and\nothers to assess a reportable\noperating segment\u2019s use of capital.\n\nSelected Metrics We present certain\nfinancial and nonfinancial metrics\nthat management uses when evaluating\nreportable operating segment results.\nManagement believes that these\nmetrics are useful to investors and\nothers to assess the performance,\ncustomer growth, and trends of\nreportable operating segments or\nlines of business.\n                                                                             \n   Table 5:                                                                  \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n   Management Reporting Structure                                            \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Wells                                                                      \n  Fargo                                                                      \n  &                                                                          \n  Compa\u2026                                                                     \n            Consum\u2026               Corpor\u2026    Wealth                          \n            Banking    Commer\u2026    and        and        Corpor\u2026              \n            and        Banking    Invest\u2026    Invest\u2026                         \n            Lending               Banking    Manage\u2026                         \n                                                                   \u2022         \n                                                                   Corpora\u2026  \n            \u2022                                                      Treasury  \n            Consum\u2026                                                \u2022         \n            Small                                                  Enterpr\u2026  \n            and        \u2022          \u2022                                Functio\u2026  \n            Busine\u2026    Middle     Banking    \u2022 Wells               \u2022         \n            Banking    Market     \u2022          Fargo                 Investm\u2026  \n            \u2022 Home     Banking    Commer\u2026    Adviso\u2026               Portfol\u2026  \n            Lending    \u2022          Real       \u2022 The                 \u2022         \n            \u2022          Asset-\u2026    Estate     Private               Venture   \n            Credit     Lending    \u2022          Bank                  capital   \n            Card       and        Markets                          and       \n            \u2022 Auto     Leasing                                     private   \n            \u2022                                                      equity    \n            Person\u2026                                                investm\u2026  \n            Lending                                                \u2022         \n                                                                   Non-str\u2026  \n                                                                   busines\u2026  \n                                                                             \n                               \n  10    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 6 and the following discussion\npresent our results by reportable\noperating segment.

to\nbrokerage customers. Fees from\nadvisory accounts are based on a\npercentage of the market value of the\nassets as of the beginning of the\nquarter, which vary across the\naccount types based on the distinct\nservices provided, and are affected\nby investment performance as well as\nasset inflows and outflows. Advisory\naccounts include assets that are\nfinancial advisor-directed and\nseparately managed by third-party\nmanagers as well as certain client-\ndirected brokerage assets where we\nearn a fee for advisory and other\nservices, but do not have investment\ndiscretion.\n\nWIM also manages personal trust and\nother assets for high net worth\nclients, with fee income earned based\non a percentage of the market value\nof these assets. Table 6h presents\nadvisory assets activity by WIM line\nof business. Management believes that\nadvisory assets is a useful metric\nbecause it allows management,\ninvestors, and others to assess how\nchanges in asset amounts may impact\nthe generation of certain asset-based\nfees.\n\nFor the first quarter of both 2024\nand 2023, the average fee rate by\naccount type ranged from 50 to 120\nbasis points.\n

Our off-\nbalance sheet arrangements include\nunfunded credit commitments,\ntransactions with unconsolidated\nentities, guarantees, derivatives,\nand other commitments. These\ntransactions are designed to (1) meet\nthe financial needs of customers, (2)\nmanage our credit, market or\nliquidity risks, and/or (3) diversify\nour funding sources.\n                                                                             \n  Unfunded Credit Commitments                                                \n                                                                             \nUnfunded credit commitments are\nlegally binding agreements to lend to\ncustomers with terms covering usage\nof funds, contractual interest rates,\nexpiration dates, and any required\ncollateral. The maximum credit risk\nfor these commitments will generally\nbe lower than the contractual amount\nbecause these commitments may expire\nwithout being used or may be\ncancelled at the customer\u2019s request.\nOur credit risk monitoring activities\ninclude managing the amount of\ncommitments, both to individual\ncustomers and in total, and the size\nand maturity structure of these\ncommitments. For additional\ninformation, see Note 5 (Loans and\nRelated Allowance for Credit Losses)\nto Financial Statements in this\nReport.\n                                                                             \n  Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities                                  \n                                                                             \nIn the normal course of business, we\nenter into various types of on- and\noff-balance sheet transactions with\nspecial purpose entities (SPEs),\nwhich are corporations, trusts,\nlimited liability companies or\npartnerships that are established for\na limited purpose. Generally, SPEs\nare formed in connection with\nsecuritization transactions and are\nconsidered variable interest entities\n(VIEs). For additional information,\nsee Note 13 (Securitizations and\nVariable Interest Entities) to\nFinancial Statements in this Report.\n                                                                             \n  Guarantees and Other Commitments                                           \n                                                                             \nGuarantees are contracts that\ncontingently require us to make\npayments to a guaranteed party based\non an event or a change in an\nunderlying asset, liability, rate or\nindex. Guarantees are generally in\nthe form of standby and direct pay\nletters of credit, written options,\nrecourse obligations, exchange and\nclearing house guarantees,\nindemnifications, and other types of\nsimilar arrangements. We also enter\ninto other commitments such as\ncommitments to purchase securities\nunder resale agreements.

Derivatives are recorded\non our consolidated balance sheet at\nfair value, and volume can be\nmeasured in terms of the notional\namount, which is generally not\nexchanged, but is used only as the\nbasis on which interest and other\npayments are determined. The notional\namount is not recorded on our\nconsolidated balance sheet and is\nnot, when viewed in isolation, a\nmeaningful measure of the risk\nprofile of the instruments. For\nadditional information, see Note 11\n(Derivatives) to Financial Statements\nin this Report.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    25  \n                               \n                   \n  Risk Management  \n                   \nWells Fargo manages a variety of\nrisks that can significantly affect\nour financial performance and our\nability to meet the expectations of\nour customers, shareholders,\nregulators and other stakeholders.\nFor additional information about how\nwe manage risk, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement\u201d section in our 2023 Form\n10-K. The discussion that follows\nsupplements our discussion of the\nmanagement of certain risks contained\nin the \u201cRisk Management\u201d section in\nour 2023 Form 10-K. Credit Risk\nManagement Credit risk is the risk of\nloss associated with a borrower or\ncounterparty default (failure to meet\nobligations in accordance with agreed\nupon terms). Credit risk exists with\nmany of the Company\u2019s assets and\nexposures such as debt security\nholdings, certain derivatives, and\nloans. The Board\u2019s Risk Committee has\nprimary oversight responsibility for\ncredit risk. A Credit Subcommittee of\nthe Risk Committee assists the Risk\nCommittee in providing oversight of\ncredit risk. At the management level,\nCorporate Credit Risk, which is part\nof Independent Risk Management, has\noversight responsibility for credit\nrisk. Corporate Credit Risk reports\nto the Chief Risk Officer and\nsupports periodic reports related to\ncredit risk provided to the Board\u2019s\nRisk Committee or its Credit\nSubcommittee. Loan Portfolio Our loan\nportfolios represent the largest\ncomponent of assets on our\nconsolidated balance sheet for which\nwe have credit risk.

In addition, the\nCompany will continue to integrate\nclimate considerations into its\ncredit risk management activities.\nOur credit risk management oversight\nprocess is governed centrally, but\nprovides for direct management and\naccountability by our lines of\nbusiness. Our overall credit process\nincludes comprehensive credit\npolicies, disciplined credit\nunderwriting, frequent and detailed\nrisk measurement and modeling,\nextensive credit training programs,\nand a continual loan review and audit\nprocess. A key to our credit risk\nmanagement is adherence to a well-\ncontrolled underwriting process,\nwhich we believe is appropriate for\nthe needs of our customers as well as\ninvestors who purchase the loans or\nsecurities collateralized by the\nloans.

See Note 5 (Loans and\nRelated Allowance for Credit Losses)\nto Financial Statements in this\nReport for more analysis and credit\nmetric information for each of the\nfollowing portfolios.\n\nCOMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND\nLEASE FINANCING\n\nFor purposes of portfolio risk\nmanagement, we aggregate commercial\nand industrial loans and lease\nfinancing according to market\nsegmentation and standard industry\ncodes. We generally subject\ncommercial and industrial loans and\nlease financing to individual risk\nassessment using our internal\nborrower and collateral quality\nratings. Our ratings are aligned to\nregulatory definitions of pass and\ncriticized categories with criticized\nsegmented among special mention,\nsubstandard, doubtful, and loss\ncategories.\n\nWe had $16.1 billion of the\ncommercial and industrial loans and\nlease financing portfolio internally\nclassified as criticized in\naccordance with regulatory guidance\nat March 31, 2024, compared with\n$14.6 billion at December 31, 2023.\nThe increase was driven by the\nutilities, entertainment and\nrecreation, health care and\npharmaceuticals, and food and\nbeverage manufacturing industries,\npartially offset by the financials\nexcept banks industry.\n\nThe majority of our commercial and\nindustrial loans and lease financing\nportfolio is secured by short-term\nassets, such as accounts receivable,\ninventory and debt securities, as\nwell as long-lived assets, such as\nequipment and other business assets.\nGenerally, the primary source of\nrepayment for this portfolio is the\noperating cash flows of customers,\nwith the collateral securing this\nportfolio representing a secondary\nsource of repayment.\n\nThe portfolio decreased at March 31,\n2024, compared with December 31,\n2023, as a result of paydowns and\ndecreased loan draws.

with\nadjustable-rate features. We monitor\nthe risk of default as a result of\ninterest rate increases on\nadjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loans,\nwhich may be mitigated by product\nfeatures that limit the amount of the\nincrease in the contractual interest\nrate. The default risk of these loans\nis considered in our ACL for loans.\nARM loans totaled $66.2 billion, or\n7% of total loans, at March 31, 2024,\ncompared with $66.7 billion, or 7% of\ntotal loans, at December 31, 2023,\nwith an initial reset date in 2026 or\nlater for the majority of this\nportfolio at March 31, 2024. We do\nnot offer option ARM products, nor do\nwe offer variable-rate mortgage\nproducts with fixed payment amounts,\ncommonly referred to within the\nfinancial services industry as\nnegative amortizing mortgage loans.\n\nThe residential mortgage \u2013 junior\nlien portfolio consists of\nresidential mortgage lines of credit\nand loans that are subordinate in\nrights to an existing lien on the\nsame property. These lines and loans\nmay have draw periods, interest-only\npayments, balloon payments,\nadjustable rates and similar\nfeatures. The outstanding balance of\nresidential mortgage lines of credit\nwas $14.2 billion at March 31, 2024,\ncompared with $15.0 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023. The unfunded\ncredit commitments for these lines of\ncredit totaled $27.4 billion at March\n31, 2024, compared with $28.6 billion\nat December 31, 2023.

increase in commercial net loan\ncharge-offs in first quarter 2024,\ncompared with the same period a year\nago, was due to higher losses in all\ncommercial portfolios, primarily in\nour commercial real estate portfolio\ndriven by the office property type.\n\nThe increase in consumer net loan\ncharge-offs in first quarter 2024,\ncompared with the same period a year\nago, was due to higher losses in our\ncredit card portfolio.\n\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES We\nmaintain an allowance for credit\nlosses (ACL) for loans, which is\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of the expected\nlifetime credit losses in the loan\nportfolio and unfunded credit\ncommitments, at the balance sheet\ndate, excluding loans and unfunded\ncredit commitments carried at fair\nvalue or held for sale. Additionally,\nwe maintain an ACL for debt\nsecurities classified as either AFS\nor HTM, other financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost, including\ndeposits with banks, net investments\nin leases, and other off-balance\nsheet credit exposures.\n\nThe process for establishing the ACL\nfor loans takes into consideration\nmany factors, including historical\nand forecasted loss trends, loan-\nlevel credit quality ratings and loan\ngrade-specific characteristics. The\nprocess involves subjective and\ncomplex judgments. In addition, we\nreview a variety of credit metrics\nand trends. These credit metrics and\ntrends, however, do not solely\ndetermine the amount of the allowance\nas we use several analytical tools.\nFor additional information on our\nACL, see the \u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies \u2013 Allowance for Credit\nLosses\u201d section and Note 1 (Summary\nof Significant Accounting Policies)\nto Financial Statements in our 2023\nForm 10-K. For additional information\non our ACL for loans, see Note 5\n(Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses) to Financial\nStatements in this Report, and for\nadditional information on our ACL for\ndebt securities, see Note 3\n(Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\nMaturity Debt Securities) to\nFinancial Statements in this Report.\n\nTable 22 presents the allocation of\nthe ACL for loans by loan

Total net loan charge-offs are\nannualized for the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2024.\n\nThe ratios for the allowance for loan\nlosses and the ACL for loans\npresented in Table 22 may fluctuate\nfrom period to period due to such\nfactors as the mix of loan types in\nthe portfolio, borrower credit\nstrength, and the value and\nmarketability of collateral. The ACL\nfor loans decreased $226 million, or\n1%, from December 31, 2023,\nreflecting decreases for commercial\nreal estate loans and auto loans,\npartially offset by increases for\ncredit card loans. The detail of the\nchanges in the ACL for loans by\nportfolio segment (including charge-\noffs and recoveries by loan class) is\nincluded in Note 5 (Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit Losses) to\nFinancial Statements in this Report.\nWe consider multiple economic\nscenarios to develop our estimate of\nthe ACL for loans, which generally\ninclude a base scenario, along with\nan optimistic (upside) and one or\nmore pessimistic (downside)\nscenarios. We weighted the base\nscenario and the downside scenarios\nin our estimate of the ACL for loans\nat March 31, 2024. The base scenario\nassumed slowing inflation with\nslowing economic growth and also\nreflected a significant decline in\ncommercial real estate prices and\nincreased unemployment rates from\nhistorically low levels. The downside\nscenarios assumed a more substantial\neconomic contraction due to declining\nproperty values, high inflation, and\nlower business and consumer\nconfidence. Additionally, we consider\nqualitative factors that represent\nthe risk of limitations inherent in\nour processes and assumptions such as\neconomic environmental factors,\nmodeling assumptions and performance,\nand other subjective factors,\nincluding industry trends and\nemerging risk assessments.\n\nThe forecasted key economic variables\nused in our estimate of the ACL for\nloans at March 31, 2024, and December\n31, 2023, are presented in Table 23.\nTable 23: Forecasted Key Economic\nVariables\n                                                                             \n                                2Q 2024           4Q 2024           2Q 2025  \n  Weighted blend of                                                          \n  economic scenarios:                                                        \n  U.S. unemployment                                                          \n  rate (1):                                                                  \n  March 31, 2024           4.1  %            4.9               5.6           \n  December 31, 2023        4.4               5.3               5.9           \n  U.S. real GDP (2):                                                         \n  March 31, 2024          -0.3              -0.5               0.4           \n  December 31, 2023       -1.2              -0.5               0.8           \n  Home price index                                                           \n  (3):                                                                       \n  March 31, 2024           1.2              -5.2              -6.3           \n  December 31, 2023       -2.3              -6.7              -6.6           \n  Commercial real                                                            \n  estate asset prices                                                        \n  (3):                                                                       \n  March 31, 2024          -2.4             -11.2             -13.6           \n  December 31, 2023       -6.6             -14.0             -10.4           \n                                                                             \n(1) Quarterly average.

Future\namounts of the ACL for loans will be\nbased on a variety of factors,\nincluding loan balance changes,\nportfolio credit quality and mix\nchanges, and changes in general\neconomic conditions and expectations\n(including for unemployment and real\nGDP), among other factors.\n                               \n  36    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nWe believe the ACL for loans of $14.9\nbillion at March 31, 2024, was\nappropriate to cover expected credit\nlosses, including unfunded credit\ncommitments, at that date. The entire\nallowance is available to absorb\ncredit losses from the total loan\nportfolio. The ACL for loans is\nsubject to change and reflects\nexisting factors as of the date of\ndetermination, including economic or\nmarket conditions and ongoing\ninternal and external examination\nprocesses. Due to the sensitivity of\nthe ACL for loans to changes in the\neconomic and business environment, it\nis possible that we will incur\nincremental credit losses not\nanticipated as of the balance sheet\ndate. Our process for determining the\nACL is discussed in the \u201cCritical\nAccounting Policies \u2013 Allowance for\nCredit Losses\u201d section and Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial Statements in\nour 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nMORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES We sell\nresidential and commercial mortgage\nloans to various parties. In\nconnection with our sales and\nsecuritization of residential\nmortgage loans, we have established a\nmortgage repurchase liability. For\ninformation on our repurchase\nliability, see the \u201cRisk Management \u2013\nCredit Risk Management \u2013 Mortgage\nBanking Activities\u201d section in our\n2023 Form 10-K.\n\nIn addition to servicing loans in our\nportfolio, we act as servicer and/or\nmaster servicer of residential and\ncommercial mortgage loans included in\ngovernment-sponsored enterprise (GSE)\nmortgage securitizations, GNMA-\nguaranteed mortgage securitizations\nof FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed\nmortgages and private label mortgage\nsecuritizations, as well as for\nunsecuritized loans owned by\ninstitutional investors.\n\nAs a servicer, we are required to\nadvance certain delinquent payments\nof principal and interest on mortgage\nloans we service. The amount and\ntiming of reimbursement for advances\nof delinquent payments vary by\ninvestor and the applicable servicing\nagreements. See Note 6 (Mortgage\nBanking Activities) to Financial\nStatements in this Report for\nadditional information about\nresidential and commercial servicing\nrights, servicer advances and\nservicing fees.\n\nIn accordance with applicable\nservicing guidelines, upon transfer\nas servicer, we have the option to\nrepurchase loans from certain loan\nsecuritizations, which generally\nbecomes exercisable based on\ndelinquency status such as when three\nscheduled loan payments are past due.\nWhen we have the unilateral option to\nrepurchase a loan, we recognize the\nloan and a corresponding liability on\nour balance sheet regardless of our\nintent to repurchase the loan. We may\nrepurchase these loans for cash and\nas a result, our total consolidated\nassets do not change.\n\nLoans repurchased from GNMA\nsecuritization pools that regain\ncurrent status or are otherwise\nmodified in accordance with\napplicable servicing guidelines may\nbe included in future GNMA loan\nsecuritization pools. At March 31,\n2024, and December 31, 2023, these\nloans, which we have repurchased or\nhave the unilateral option to\nrepurchase, were $7.7 billion and\n$7.8 billion, respectively, which\nincluded $7.3 billion and $7.4\nbillion, respectively, in loans held\nfor investment, with the remainder in\nloans held for sale. See Note 13\n(Securitizations and Variable\nInterest Entities) to Financial\nStatements in this Report for\nadditional information about our\ninvolvement with mortgage loan\nsecuritizations.\n\nFor additional information about the\nrisks related to our servicing\nactivities, see the \u201cRisk Management\n\u2013 Credit Risk Management \u2013 Mortgage\nBanking Activities\u201d section in our\n2023 Form 10-K.

For additional\ninformation on our oversight of\nasset/liability risks, see the \"Risk\nManagement \u2013 Asset/Liability\nManagement\" section in our 2023 Form\n10-K.\n\nINTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk\nis the risk that market fluctuations\nin interest rates, credit spreads, or\nforeign exchange can cause a loss of\nthe Company\u2019s earnings and capital\nstemming from mismatches in the cash\nflows of the Company\u2019s assets and\nliabilities generally arising from\ncustomer-related lending and deposit-\ntaking activities. We are subject to\ninterest rate risk because:\n\n\u2022 assets and liabilities may mature\nor reprice at different times or by\ndifferent amounts;\n\n\u2022 short-term and long-term market\ninterest rates may change\nindependently or with different\nmagnitudes;\n\n\u2022 the remaining maturity for various\nassets or liabilities may shorten or\nlengthen as interest rates change; or\n\n\u2022 interest rates may also have a\ndirect or indirect effect on loan\ndemand, collateral values, credit\nlosses, loan origination volume, and\nthe fair value of financial\ninstruments and MSRs.\n\nWe assess interest rate risk by\ncomparing the earnings outcomes from\nmultiple interest rate scenarios that\ndiffer in the direction of interest\nrate changes, the degree and speed of\ninterest rate changes over time, and\nthe projected shape of the yield\ncurve. These scenarios require\nassumptions regarding drivers of\nearnings and balance sheet\ncomposition such as loan\noriginations, prepayment rates on\nloans and debt securities, deposit\nflows and mix, as well as pricing\nstrategies. We periodically assess\nand enhance our scenarios and\nassumptions. Our scenario assumptions\nreflected the following:\n\n\u2022 Scenarios are dynamic and reflect\nanticipated changes to our assets and\nliabilities over time.\n\n\u2022 Mortgage prepayment and origination\nassumptions vary across scenarios and\nreflect only the impact of the higher\nor lower interest rates.\n\n\u2022 Other macroeconomic variables that\ncould be correlated with the changes\nin interest rates are held constant.\n\n\u2022 The funding forecast in our base\nscenario incorporates deposit mix\nchanges and market funding levels\nconsistent with the base interest\nrate trajectory. Our hypothetical\nscenarios incorporate deposit mix\nthat is the same as in the base\nscenario. In higher interest rate\nscenarios, customer deposit activity\nthat shifts balances into higher\nyielding products and/or requires\nadditional market funding could\nreduce the expected benefit from\nhigher rates.\n\n\u2022 The interest rate sensitivity of\ndeposits as market interest rates\nchange, referred to as deposit betas,\nare informed by historical behavior\nand expectations for near-term\npricing strategies. Our actual\nexperience may differ from\nexpectations due to the lag or\nacceleration of deposit repricing,\nchanges in consumer behavior, and\nother factors.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    37  \n                               \nRisk Management \u2013 Asset/Liability\nManagement (continued)\n\nTable 24 presents the results of the\nestimated net interest income\nsensitivity over the next 12 months\nfrom the multiple scenarios compared\nwith our base scenario.

The changes in our interest rate\nsensitivity from December 31, 2023, to March 31, 2024, reflected updates for\nour expected balance sheet composition, including a shift to higher cost\ndeposits. The magnitude of the benefit, if any, from higher interest rates\nmay vary from our scenarios, including because future deposit pricing and\nbalances may be different from our current expectations. The realized impact\nof interest rate changes may also vary from our base and hypothetical\nscenarios for various reasons, including any deposit pricing lags. We use\ninterest rate derivatives and our debt securities portfolio to manage our\ninterest rate exposures. We use derivatives for asset/liability management to\n(i) convert cash flows from selected assets and/or liabilities from floating-\nrate payments to fixed-rate payments, or vice versa, (ii) reduce accumulated\nother comprehensive income (AOCI) sensitivity of our AFS debt securities\nportfolio, and/or (iii) economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline,\nfunded mortgage loans, and MSRs. Derivatives used to hedge our interest rate\nrisk exposures are presented in Note 11 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements\nin this Report. As interest rates increase, changes in the fair value of AFS\ndebt securities may negatively affect AOCI, which lowers the amount of our\nregulatory capital. AOCI also includes unrealized gains or losses related to\nthe transfer of debt securities from AFS to HTM, which are subsequently\namortized into earnings over the life of the security with no further impact\nfrom interest rate changes. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt\nSecurities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information\non our debt securities portfolio. In addition to the net interest income\nsensitivity above, we also measure and evaluate the economic value\nsensitivity (EVS) of our balance sheet. EVS is the change in the present\nvalue of the life-time cash flows of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities\nacross a range of scenarios. It is based on the existing balance\n\nsheet, at a point in time, and helps indicate whether we are exposed to\nhigher or lower interest rates. We manage EVS through a set of limits that\nare designed to align with our interest rate risk appetite. Our interest rate\nsensitive noninterest income and expense are impacted by mortgage banking\nactivities that may have sensitivity impacts that move in the opposite\ndirection of our net interest income. See the \u201cRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability Management \u2013 Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk\u201d\nsection in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. Interest rate\nsensitive noninterest income is also impacted by changes in earnings credit\nfor noninterest-bearing deposits that reduce treasury management deposit-\nrelated service fees on commercial accounts, and by trading assets. In\naddition, the impact to net interest income does not include the fair value\nchanges of trading securities, which, along with the effects of related\neconomic hedges, are recorded in noninterest income. In addition to changes\nin interest rates, net interest income and noninterest income from trading\nsecurities may be impacted by the actual composition of the trading\nportfolio. For additional information on our trading assets and liabilities,\nsee Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report.\nMORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK We originate and service\nmortgage loans, which subjects us to various risks, including market,\ninterest rate, credit, and liquidity risks that can be substantial. Based on\nmarket conditions and other factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by\nselling or securitizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage loans\nwill be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment, but\nmay change our intent to hold loans for investment or sale as part of our\ncorporate asset/liability management activities. We may also retain\nsecurities in our investment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage\nloans. Changes in interest rates may impact mortgage banking noninterest\nincome, including origination and servicing fees, and the fair value of our\nresidential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan commitments (interest rate\n\u201clocks\u201d) extended to mortgage applicants. Interest rate changes will\ngenerally impact our mortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis\ndue to the time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer\ndemand, as well as the time required for processing a new application,\nproviding the commitment, and securitizing and selling the loan. The amount\nand timing of the impact will depend on the magnitude, speed and duration of\nthe changes in interest rates. For additional information on mortgage\nbanking, including key assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of\nMSRs, see the \u201cRisk Management \u2013 Asset/Liability Management \u2013 Mortgage\nBanking Interest Rate and Market Risk\u201d section and Note 6 (Mortgage Banking\nActivities), Note 14 (Derivatives), and Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and\nLiabilities) to Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K. MARKET RISK\nMarket risk is the risk of possible economic loss from adverse changes in\nmarket risk factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange\nrates, equity and commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to\ncounterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, basis risk,\nand market liquidity risk. It includes price risk in the trading book,\nmortgage servicing rights, the hedge effectiveness risk associated with the\nmortgage book held at fair value, and impairment on private equity\ninvestments. For additional information on our oversight of market risk, see\nthe \u201cRisk Management \u2013 Asset/Liability Management \u2013 Market Risk\u201d section in\nour 2023 Form 10-K.\n                               \n  38    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nMARKET RISK \u2013 TRADING ACTIVITIES We\nengage in trading activities to\naccommodate the investment and risk\nmanagement activities of our\ncustomers and to execute economic\nhedging to manage certain balance\nsheet risks. These trading activities\npredominantly occur within our CIB\nbusinesses. Debt and equity\nsecurities held for trading, trading\nloans, and trading derivatives are\nfinancial instruments used in our\ntrading activities, and are measured\nat fair value through earnings.\nIncome earned on the financial\ninstruments used in our trading\nactivities include net interest\nincome, changes in fair value, and\nrealized gains and losses. Net\ninterest income earned from our\ntrading activities is reflected in\nthe interest income and interest\nexpense components of our\nconsolidated statement of income.\nChanges in fair value and realized\ngains and losses of the financial\ninstruments used in our trading\nactivities are reflected in net gains\nfrom trading activities. For\nadditional information on the\n\nfinancial instruments used in our\ntrading activities and the income\nfrom these trading activities, see\nNote 2 (Trading Activities) to\nFinancial Statements in this Report.\n\nValue-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical\nrisk measure used to estimate the\npotential loss from adverse moves in\nthe financial markets, and Trading\nVaR is a measure used to provide\ninsight into the market risk\nexhibited by the Company\u2019s trading\npositions on our consolidated balance\nsheet.

The diversification\neffect arises because the risks are\nnot perfectly correlated causing a\nportfolio of positions to usually be\nless risky than the sum of the risks\nof the positions alone. The\ndiversification benefit is not\nmeaningful for low and high metrics\nsince they may occur on different\ndays.\n\nMARKET RISK \u2013 EQUITY SECURITIES We\nare directly and indirectly affected\nby changes in the equity markets. We\nmake and manage equity investments in\nvarious businesses, such as start-up\ncompanies and emerging growth\ncompanies. We also invest in funds\nthat make similar private equity\ninvestments. For additional\ninformation, see the \u201cRisk Management\n\u2013 Asset/Liability Management \u2013 Market\nRisk \u2013 Equity Securities\u201d section in\nour 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nAs part of our business to support\nour customers, we trade public\nequities, listed/over-the-counter\nequity derivatives, and convertible\nbonds. We have parameters that govern\nthese activities. We also have\nmarketable equity securities that\ninclude investments relating to our\nventure capital activities. For\nadditional information, see Note 4\n(Equity Securities) to Financial\nStatements in this Report.\n\nChanges in equity market prices may\nalso indirectly affect our net income\nby (1) the value of third-party\nassets under management and, hence,\nfee income, (2) borrowers whose\nability to repay principal and/or\ninterest may be affected by the stock\nmarket, or (3) brokerage activity,\nrelated commission income and other\nbusiness activities. Each business\nline monitors and manages these\nindirect risks.\n\nLIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING Liquidity\nrisk is the risk arising from the\ninability of the Company to meet\nobligations when they come due, or\nroll over funds at a reasonable cost,\nwithout incurring heightened costs.\nIn the ordinary course of business,\nwe enter into contractual obligations\nthat may require future cash\npayments, including funding for\ncustomer loan requests, customer\ndeposit maturities and withdrawals,\ndebt service,\n\nleases for premises and equipment,\nand other cash commitments. Liquidity\nrisk also considers the stability of\ndeposits, including the risk of\nlosing uninsured or non-operational\ndeposits. The objective of effective\nliquidity management is to be able to\nmeet our contractual obligations and\nother cash commitments efficiently\nunder both normal operating\nconditions and under periods of Wells\nFargo-specific and/or market stress.\n\nTo help achieve this objective, the\nBoard establishes liquidity\nguidelines that require sufficient\nasset-based liquidity to cover\npotential funding requirements and to\navoid over-dependence on volatile,\nless reliable funding markets. These\nguidelines are monitored on a monthly\nbasis by the management-level\nCorporate Asset/Liability Committee\nand on a quarterly basis by the\nBoard. These guidelines are\nestablished and monitored for both\nthe Company and the Parent on a\nstand-alone basis so that the Parent\nis a source of strength for its\nbanking subsidiaries. For additional\ninformation on liquidity risk and\nfunding management, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Liquidity Risk and\nFunding\u201d section in our 2023 Form\n10-K.\n\nLiquidity Standards We are subject to\na rule issued by the FRB, OCC and\nFDIC that establishes a quantitative\nminimum liquidity requirement\nconsistent with the liquidity\ncoverage ratio (LCR) established by\nthe Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision (BCBS). The rule requires\na covered banking organization to\nhold high-quality liquid assets\n(HQLA) in an amount equal to or\ngreater than its projected net cash\noutflows during a 30-day stress\nperiod. Our HQLA under the rule\nmainly consists of central bank\ndeposits, government debt securities,\nand mortgage-\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    39  \n                               \nRisk Management \u2013 Asset/Liability\nManagement (continued)\n\nbacked securities of federal\nagencies. The LCR applies to the\nCompany and to our insured depository\ninstitutions (IDIs) with total assets\nof $10 billion or more. In addition,\nrules issued by the FRB impose\nenhanced liquidity risk management\nstandards on large bank holding\ncompanies (BHCs), such as Wells\nFargo.\n\nWe are also subject to a rule issued\nby the FRB, OCC and FDIC that\nestablishes a stable funding\nrequirement, known as the net stable\nfunding ratio (NSFR), which requires\na covered banking organization, such\nas Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum\namount of stable funding, including\ncommon equity, long-term debt and\nmost types of deposits, in relation\nto its assets, derivative exposures\nand commitments over a one-year\nhorizon\n\nperiod. The NSFR applies to the\nCompany and to our IDIs with total\nassets of $10 billion or more. As of\nMarch 31, 2024, we were compliant\nwith the NSFR requirement.\n\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio As of March\n31, 2024, the Company, Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A., and Wells Fargo National\nBank West exceeded the minimum LCR\nrequirement of 100%. Table 26\npresents the Company\u2019s quarterly\naverage values for the daily-\ncalculated LCR and its components\ncalculated pursuant to the LCR rule\nrequirements.

We believe the debt\nsecurities included in Table 27\nprovide quick and reliable sources of\nliquidity through sales or by\npledging to obtain financing,\nregardless of market conditions. Debt\nsecurities within our HTM portfolio\nare not intended for sale but may be\npledged to obtain financing.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had\napproximately $516.2 billion of\navailable borrowing capacity at\nvarious Federal Home Loan Banks\n(FHLB) and the Federal Reserve\nDiscount Window, based on collateral\npledged. Although available, we do\nnot view this borrowing capacity as a\nprimary source of liquidity.\n\nIn addition, liquidity is also\navailable through the sale or\nfinancing of other debt securities,\nincluding trading and/or AFS debt\nsecurities, as well as through the\nsale, securitization, or financing of\nloans, to the extent such debt\nsecurities and loans are not\nencumbered.\n\nFunding Sources The Parent acts as a\nsource of funding for the Company\nthrough the issuance of long-term\ndebt and equity. WFC Holdings, LLC\n(the \u201cIHC\u201d) is an intermediate\nholding\n\ncompany and subsidiary of the Parent,\nwhich provides funding support for\nthe ongoing operational requirements\nof the Parent and certain of its\ndirect and indirect subsidiaries. For\nadditional information on the IHC,\nsee the \u201cRegulatory Matters \u2013 \u2018Living\nWill\u2019 Requirements and Related\nMatters\u201d section in our 2023 Form\n10-K. Additional subsidiary funding\nis provided by deposits, short-term\nborrowings and long-term debt.\n\nDeposits have historically provided a\nsizable source of relatively low-cost\nfunds. Loans were 67% and 69% of\ntotal deposits at March 31, 2024, and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nTable 28 presents a summary of our\nshort-term borrowings, which\ngenerally mature in less than 30\ndays. The balances of federal funds\npurchased and securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase may vary\nover time due to client activity, our\nown demand for financing, and our\noverall mix of liabilities.

We primarily fund our\ncapital needs through the retention\nof earnings net of both dividends and\nshare repurchases, as well as through\nthe issuance of preferred stock and\nlong- and short-term debt. Retained\nearnings at March 31, 2024, increased\n$2.7 billion from December 31, 2023,\npredominantly as a result of $4.6\nbillion of Wells Fargo net income,\npartially offset by $1.6 billion of\ncommon and preferred stock dividends.\nDuring first quarter 2024, we issued\n$599 million of common stock,\nsubstantially all of which was issued\nin connection with employee\ncompensation and benefits. In first\nquarter 2024, we repurchased 112\nmillion shares of common stock at a\ncost of $6.1 billion. For additional\ninformation about capital planning,\nsee the \u201cCapital Planning and Stress\nTesting\u201d section below.\n\nIn March 2024, we redeemed all of our\nPreferred Stock, Series R. For\nadditional information, see Note 9\n(Preferred Stock) to Financial\nStatements in this Report.\n                                                                             \n  Regulatory Capital Requirements                                            \n                                                                             \nThe Company and each of our IDIs are\nsubject to various regulatory capital\nadequacy requirements administered by\nthe FRB and the OCC. Risk-based\ncapital rules establish risk-adjusted\nratios relating regulatory capital to\ndifferent categories of assets and\noff-balance sheet exposures as\ndiscussed below.\n\nRISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED\nASSETS The Company is subject to\nrules issued by federal banking\nregulators to implement Basel III\ncapital requirements for U.S. banking\norganizations. The rules contain two\nframeworks for calculating capital\nrequirements, a Standardized Approach\nand an Advanced Approach applicable\nto certain institutions, including\nWells Fargo, and we must calculate\nour risk-based capital ratios under\nboth approaches. The Company is\nrequired to satisfy the risk-based\ncapital ratio requirements to avoid\nrestrictions on capital distributions\nand discretionary bonus payments.\n\nOn July 27, 2023, federal banking\nregulators issued a proposed rule to\nimplement the final components of\nBasel III, which would impact risk-\nbased capital requirements for\ncertain banks. The proposed rule\nwould eliminate the current Advanced\nApproach and replace it with a new\nexpanded risk-based approach for the\nmeasurement of risk-weighted assets,\nincluding more granular risk weights\nfor credit risk, a new market risk\nframework, and a new standardized\napproach for measuring operational\nrisk. Based on the proposed rule, the\nnew requirements would be phased in\nover a three-year period beginning\nJuly 1, 2025. If the rule is adopted\nas currently proposed, the Company\nwould expect a significant increase\nin its risk-weighted assets and a net\nincrease in its capital requirements\nbased on an assessment of the\nproposed rule. The Company is\nconsidering a range of potential\nactions to address the impact of the\nproposed rule, including balance\nsheet and capital optimization\nstrategies.\n\nTable 31 and Table 32 present the\nrisk-based capital requirements\napplicable to the Company under the\nStandardized Approach and Advanced\nApproach, respectively, as of March\n31, 2024.\n\nTable 31: Risk-Based Capital\nRequirements \u2013 Standardized Approach\n\nTable 32: Risk-Based Capital\nRequirements \u2013 Advanced Approach\n\nIn addition to the risk-based capital\nrequirements described in Table 31\nand Table 32, if the FRB determines\nthat a period of excessive credit\ngrowth is contributing to an increase\nin systemic risk, a countercyclical\nbuffer of up to 2.50% could be added\nto the risk-based capital ratio\nrequirements under federal banking\nregulations. The countercyclical\nbuffer in effect at March 31, 2024,\nwas 0.00%.\n\nThe capital conservation buffer is\napplicable to certain institutions,\nincluding Wells Fargo, under the\nAdvanced Approach and is intended to\nabsorb losses during times of\neconomic or financial stress.\n\nThe stress capital buffer is\ncalculated based on the decrease in a\nBHC\u2019s risk-based capital ratios under\nthe severely adverse scenario in the\nFRB\u2019s annual supervisory stress test\nand related Comprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review (CCAR), plus four\nquarters of planned common stock\ndividends. Because the stress capital\nbuffer is calculated annually based\non data that can differ over time,\nour stress capital buffer, and thus\nour risk-based capital ratio\nrequirements under the Standardized\nApproach, are subject to change in\nfuture periods. Our stress capital\nbuffer for the period October 1,\n2023, through September 30, 2024, is\n2.90%.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    43  \n                               \n                                                                             \n  Capital Management(continued)                                              \n                                                                             \nAs a global systemically important\nbank (G-SIB), we are also subject to\nthe FRB\u2019s rule implementing an\nadditional capital surcharge between\n1.00-4.50% on the risk-based capital\nratio requirements of G-SIBs. Under\nthe rule, we must annually calculate\nour surcharge under two methods and\nuse the higher\n\nof the two surcharges. The first\nmethod (method one) considers our\nsize, interconnectedness, cross-\njurisdictional activity,\nsubstitutability, and complexity,\nconsistent with the methodology\ndeveloped by the BCBS and the\nFinancial Stability Board (FSB). The\nsecond method (method two) uses\nsimilar inputs, but replaces\nsubstitutability with use of short-\nterm wholesale funding and will\ngenerally result in higher surcharges\nthan under method one. Because the\nG-SIB capital surcharge is calculated\nannually based on data that can\ndiffer over time, the amount of the\nsurcharge is subject to change in\nfuture years. If our annual\ncalculation results in a decrease to\nour G-SIB capital surcharge, the\ndecrease takes effect the next\ncalendar year. If our annual\ncalculation results in an increase to\nour G-SIB capital\n\nsurcharge, the increase takes effect\nin two calendar years. Our\n\nG-SIB capital surcharge will continue\nto be 1.50% in 2024. On July 27,\n2023, the FRB issued a proposed rule\nthat would impact the methodology\nused to calculate the G-SIB capital\nsurcharge.\n\nUnder the risk-based capital rules,\non-balance sheet assets and credit\nequivalent amounts of derivatives and\noff-balance sheet items are assigned\nto one of several broad risk\ncategories according to the obligor,\nor, if relevant, the guarantor or the\nnature of any collateral. The\naggregate dollar amount in each risk\ncategory is then multiplied by the\nrisk weight associated with that\ncategory. The resulting weighted\nvalues from each of the risk\ncategories are aggregated for\ndetermining total risk-weighted\nassets (RWAs).\n\nThe tables that follow provide\ninformation about our risk-based\ncapital and related ratios as\ncalculated under Basel III capital\nrules. Table 33 summarizes our CET1,\nTier 1 capital, total capital, RWAs\nand capital ratios.\n                                                                             \n  Table 33:

(CECL) transition provision. In second\nquarter 2020, the Company elected to apply a modified transition provision\nissued by federal banking regulators related to the impact of CECL on\nregulatory capital. The rule permits certain banking organizations to exclude\nfrom regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of CECL, plus 25% of the\ncumulative changes in the allowance for credit losses (ACL) under CECL for\neach period until December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year phase-out\nperiod in which the benefit is reduced by 25% in year one, 50% in year two\nand 75% in year three.\n\n(3) Differences between the approaches are driven by the qualifying amounts\nof ACL includable in Tier 2 capital. Under the Advanced Approach, eligible\ncredit reserves represented by the amount of qualifying ACL in excess of\nexpected credit losses (using regulatory definitions) is limited to 0.60% of\nAdvanced credit RWAs, whereas the Standardized Approach includes ACL in Tier\n2 capital up to 1.25% of Standardized credit RWAs. Under both approaches, any\nexcess ACL is deducted from the respective total RWAs.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    45  \n                               \n                                                                             \n  Capital Management(continued)                                              \n                                                                             \nTable 35 provides the composition and\nnet changes in the components of RWAs\nunder the Standardized and Advanced\nApproaches.\n                                                                             \n  Table 35:                                                                  \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Risk-Weighted Assets                                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  (\u2026                                                                         \n  m\u2026                                 $                                $      \n  R\u2026            Mar         Dec    Ch\u2026             M\u2026         D\u2026    Ch\u2026  A\u2026  \n  a\u2026            31,         31,    20\u2026  S\u2026         3\u2026         3\u2026    20\u2026  A\u2026  \n  (\u2026            20\u2026         20\u2026    20\u2026  A\u2026         2\u2026         2\u2026    20\u2026  (\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  C\u2026    $  1,\u2026         1,\u2026         -6\u2026        75\u2026        75\u2026        -2\u2026      \n  r\u2026                                                                         \n  M\u2026       45\u2026         48\u2026         -3\u2026        45\u2026        48\u2026        -3\u2026      \n  r\u2026                                                                         \n  O\u2026       N/A         N/A         N/A        29\u2026        30\u2026        -1\u2026      \n  r\u2026                                                                         \n  T\u2026    $  1,\u2026         1,\u2026         -1\u2026        1,\u2026        1,\u2026        -1\u2026      \n  R\u2026                                                                         \n                                                                             \n(1) RWAs calculated under the\nAdvanced Approach utilize a risk-\nsensitive methodology, which relies\nupon the use of internal credit\nmodels based upon our experience with\ninternal rating grades.

The\nratios are (i) tangible book value\nper common share, which represents\ntangible common equity divided by\ncommon shares outstanding; and (ii)\nreturn on average tangible common\n\nequity (ROTCE), which represents our\nannualized earnings as a percentage\nof tangible common equity. The\nmethodology of determining tangible\ncommon equity may differ among\ncompanies. Management believes that\ntangible book value per common share\nand return on average tangible common\nequity, which utilize tangible common\nequity, are useful financial measures\nbecause they enable management,\ninvestors, and others to assess the\nCompany\u2019s use of equity.\n\nTable 37 provides a reconciliation of\nthese non-GAAP financial measures to\nGAAP financial measures.\n

Our principal\nU.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries,\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, and\nWells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC,\nare subject to regulations to\nmaintain minimum net capital\nrequirements. As of March 31, 2024,\nthese broker-dealer subsidiaries were\nin compliance with their respective\nregulatory minimum net capital\nrequirements. Capital Planning and\nStress Testing Our planned long-term\ncapital structure is designed to meet\nregulatory and market expectations.\nWe believe that our long-term\ntargeted capital structure enables us\nto invest in and grow our business,\nsatisfy our customers\u2019 financial\nneeds in varying environments, access\nmarkets, and maintain flexibility to\nreturn capital to our shareholders.\nOur long-term targeted capital\nstructure also considers capital\nlevels sufficient to exceed capital\nrequirements, including the G-SIB\ncapital surcharge and the stress\ncapital buffer, as well as potential\nchanges to regulatory requirements\nfor our capital ratios, planned\ncapital actions, changes in our risk\nprofile and other factors.\nAccordingly, our long-term target\ncapital levels are set above their\nrespective regulatory minimums plus\nbuffers. The FRB capital plan rule\nestablishes capital planning and\nother requirements that govern\ncapital distributions, including\ndividends and share repurchases, by\ncertain BHCs, including Wells Fargo.\nThe FRB assesses, among other things,\nthe overall financial condition, risk\nprofile, and capital adequacy of BHCs\nwhen evaluating their capital plans.\nAs part of the annual CCAR, the FRB\ngenerates a supervisory stress test.\nThe FRB reviews the supervisory\nstress test results as required under\nthe Dodd-Frank Act using a common set\nof capital actions for all large BHCs\nand also reviews the Company\u2019s\nproposed capital actions. Federal\nbanking regulators also require large\nBHCs and banks to conduct their own\nstress tests to evaluate whether the\ninstitution has sufficient capital to\ncontinue to operate during periods of\nadverse economic and financial\nconditions.\n                               \n  48    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \n                                                                             \n  Securities Repurchases                                                     \n                                                                             \nOn July 25, 2023, we announced that\nour Board authorized a common stock\nrepurchase program of up to $30\nbillion. Unless modified or revoked\nby the Board, this authorization does\nnot expire and is our only common\nstock repurchase program in effect.\nAt March 31, 2024, we had remaining\nBoard authority to repurchase up to\napproximately $20.7 billion of common\nstock.\n\nVarious factors impact the amount and\ntiming of our share repurchases,\nincluding the earnings, cash\nrequirements and financial condition\nof the Company, the impact to our\nbalance sheet of expected customer\nactivity, our capital requirements\nand long-term targeted capital\nstructure, the results of supervisory\nstress tests, market conditions\n(including the trading price of our\nstock), and regulatory and legal\nconsiderations, including regulatory\nrequirements under the FRB\u2019s capital\nplan\n\nrule. Although we announce when the\nBoard authorizes a share repurchase\nprogram, we typically do not give any\npublic notice before we repurchase\nour shares. Due to the various\nfactors that may impact the amount\nand timing of our share repurchases\nand the fact that we may be in the\nmarket throughout the year, our share\nrepurchases occur at various prices.\nWe may suspend share repurchase\nactivity at any time.\n\nFurthermore, the Company has a\nvariety of benefit plans in which\nemployees may own or obtain shares of\nour common stock. The Company may buy\nshares from these plans to\naccommodate employee preferences and\nthese purchases are subtracted from\nour repurchase authority.\n\nFor additional information about\nshare repurchases during first\nquarter 2024, see Part II, Item 2 in\nthis Report.\n                      \n  Regulatory Matters  \n                      \nThe U.S. financial services industry\nis subject to significant regulation\nand regulatory oversight initiatives.\nThis regulation and oversight may\ncontinue to impact how U.S. financial\nservices companies conduct business\nand may continue to result in\nincreased regulatory compliance\ncosts.\n\nFor a discussion of certain consent\norders applicable to the Company, see\nthe \u201cOverview\u201d section in this\nReport. The following supplements our\ndiscussion of other significant\nregulations and regulatory oversight\ninitiatives that have affected or may\naffect our business contained in the\n\u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d sections in our 2023 Form\n10-K.\n\nRegulatory Developments in Response\nto Climate Change Federal, state, and\nnon-U.S. governments and government\nagencies have demonstrated increased\nattention to the impacts and\npotential risks associated with\nclimate change. For example, federal\nbanking regulators are reviewing the\nimplications of climate change on the\nfinancial stability of the United\nStates and have issued guidance on\nthe identification and management by\nlarge banks of climate-related\nfinancial risks. In addition, the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC) adopted final rules requiring\npublic companies to disclose certain\nclimate-related information,\nincluding climate-related risks and\nimpacts, certain greenhouse gas\nemissions, climate-related targets\nand goals, and governance of climate-\nrelated risks and relevant risk\nmanagement processes. Similarly,\nCalifornia\u2019s state legislature\nfinalized climate-related disclosure\nlaws, while the European Union\nfinalized its Corporate\nSustainability Reporting Directive.\nThe approaches taken by various\ngovernments and government agencies\ncan vary significantly, evolve over\ntime, and sometimes conflict. Any\ncurrent or future rules, regulations,\nand guidance related to climate\nchange and its impacts could require\nus to change certain of our business\npractices, reduce our revenue and\nearnings, impose additional costs on\nus, subject us to legal or regulatory\nproceedings, or otherwise adversely\naffect our business operations and/or\ncompetitive position.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    49  \n                               \n                                \n  Critical Accounting Policies  \n                                \nOur significant accounting policies\nare fundamental to understanding our\nresults of operations and financial\ncondition because they require that\nwe use estimates and assumptions that\nmay affect the value of our assets or\nliabilities and financial results.\nSix of these policies are critical\nbecause they require management to\nmake difficult, subjective and\ncomplex judgments about matters that\nare inherently uncertain and because\nit is likely that materially\ndifferent amounts would be reported\nunder different conditions or using\ndifferent assumptions. These policies\ngovern:\n\n\u2022 the allowance for credit losses;\n\n\u2022 the valuation of residential MSRs;\n\n\u2022 the fair value of financial\ninstruments;\n\n\u2022 income taxes;\n\n\u2022 liability for legal actions; and\n\n\u2022 goodwill impairment.\n\nManagement has discussed these\ncritical accounting policies and the\nrelated estimates and judgments with\nthe Board\u2019s Audit Committee.

Because forward-\nlooking statements relate to the\nfuture, they are subject to inherent\nuncertainties, risks and changes in\ncircumstances that are difficult to\npredict.

We\nare unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because we\nare unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate\ncalculation or estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the\nreconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in forecasting\nand quantifying future amounts or when they may occur.

The Company\u2019s chief\nexecutive officer and chief financial officer participated in the evaluation.\nBased on this evaluation, the Company\u2019s chief executive officer and chief\nfinancial officer concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective as of March 31, 2024.\n                                             \n  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  \n                                             \nInternal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)\npromulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed\nby, or under the supervision of, the Company\u2019s principal executive and\nprincipal financial officers and effected by the Company\u2019s Board, management\nand other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP) and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n\u2022 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately\nand fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the\nCompany;\n\n\u2022 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that\nreceipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance\nwith authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n\n\u2022 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that\ncould have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No\nchange occurred during first quarter 2024 that has materially affected, or is\nreasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\n

We provide\nbanking, investment and mortgage products and services, as well as consumer\nand commercial finance, through banking locations and offices, the internet\nand other distribution channels to individuals, businesses and institutions\nin all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in countries outside the U.S.\nWhen we refer to \u201cWells Fargo,\u201d \u201cthe Company,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus,\u201d we mean\nWells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells Fargo & Company\n(the Parent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding company. We\nalso hold a majority interest in a real estate investment trust, which has\npublicly traded preferred stock outstanding. Our accounting and reporting\npolicies conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)\nand practices in the financial services industry. For a discussion of our\nsignificant accounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 (2023 Form 10-K). There were no material changes to these\npolicies in first quarter 2024. To prepare the financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP, management must make estimates based on assumptions\nabout future economic and market conditions (for example, unemployment,\nmarket liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) that affect the reported amounts\nof assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, income and\nexpenses during the reporting period and the related disclosures. Although\nour estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change\nin the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be\nworse than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our\nresults of operations and financial condition. Management has made\nsignificant estimates in several areas, including: \u2022 allowance for credit\nlosses (Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) and Note 3\n(Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities)); \u2022 valuations of\nresidential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) (Note 6 (Mortgage Banking\nActivities) and Note 13 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities)); \u2022\nvaluations of financial instruments (Note 12 (Fair Values of Assets and\nLiabilities)); \u2022 liability for legal actions (Note 10 (Legal Actions)); \u2022\nincome taxes; and \u2022 goodwill impairment (Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other\nAssets)). Actual results could differ from those estimates. These unaudited\ninterim financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion\nof management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods\npresented. These adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, unless\notherwise disclosed in this Form 10-Q. The results of operations in the\ninterim financial statements do not necessarily indicate the results that may\nbe expected for the full year. The interim financial information should be\nread in conjunction with our 2023 Form 10-K. Accounting Standards Adopted in\n2024 In 2024, we adopted the following new accounting guidance: \u2022 Accounting\nStandards Update (ASU) 2023-02, Investments \u2013 Equity Method and Joint\nVentures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures\nUsing the Proportional Amortization Method \u2022 ASU 2022-03, Fair Value\nMeasurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject\nto Contractual Sale Restrictions ASU 2023-02 expands the use of the\nproportional amortization method of accounting for tax credit investments,\nwhich previously was limited to affordable housing investments that generate\nlow-income housing tax credits. Upon adoption of the Update, an entity may\nelect to account for equity investments that generate income tax credits and\nbenefits using the proportional amortization method if certain eligibility\ncriteria are met. The proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of\na tax credit investment in proportion to the income tax credits and income\ntax benefits received. The amortization and related income tax credits and\nbenefits are recorded on a net basis within income tax expense. The cost of\nan investment includes unfunded commitments that are either legally binding\nor contingent but probable of funding. Such unfunded commitments are not\nrecognized under other methods of accounting. We adopted the Update on\nJanuary 1, 2024, on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative effect\nadjustment to retained earnings. Upon adoption, we elected to account for\neligible investments in our renewable energy tax credit portfolio using the\nproportional amortization method. These investments were previously accounted\nfor using the equity method. We also elected to continue use of the\nproportional amortization method to account for our affordable housing\ninvestments. In addition, we elected to classify liabilities recognized for\nunfunded commitments related to proportional amortization method investments\nin accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet,\nincluding a change to unfunded commitments for affordable housing investments\nthat were previously included in long-term debt.

The credit quality indicators\nthat we most closely monitor include credit ratings and delinquency status\nand are based on information as of our financial statement date. CREDIT\nRATINGS Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a debt\nsecurity. We determine the credit rating of a security according to the\nlowest credit rating made available by national recognized statistical rating\norganizations (NRSROs). Debt securities rated investment grade, that is those\nwith ratings similar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as defined by NRSROs, are\ngenerally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low\ncredit risk. Conversely, debt securities rated below investment grade,\nlabeled as \u201cspeculative grade\u201d by the rating agencies, are considered to be\ndistinctively higher credit risk than investment grade debt securities. For\ndebt securities not rated by NRSROs, we determine an internal credit grade of\nthe debt securities (used for credit risk management purposes) equivalent to\nthe credit ratings assigned by major credit agencies. Substantially all of\nour debt securities were rated by NRSROs at March 31, 2024, and December 31,\n2023.

recognition of credit losses. As such, as part\nof our monitoring of the credit quality of the debt security portfolio, we\nconsider whether debt securities we own are past due in payment of principal\nor interest payments and whether any securities have been placed into\nnonaccrual status. Debt securities that are past due and still accruing or in\nnonaccrual status were insignificant at both March 31, 2024, and December 31,\n2023. Net charge-offs on debt securities were insignificant in the first\nquarter of both 2024 and 2023. Purchased debt securities with credit\ndeterioration (PCD) are not considered to be in nonaccrual status, as\npayments from issuers of these securities remain current. PCD securities were\ninsignificant in the first quarter of both 2024 and 2023.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    65  \n                               \nNote 3: Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities (continued)\n\nUnrealized Losses of Available-for-Sale Debt Securities Table 3.5 shows the\ngross unrealized losses and fair value of AFS debt securities by length of\ntime those individual securities in each category have been in a continuous\nloss position.

losses included in\nthe previous table for credit impairment. As part of that assessment we\nevaluated and concluded that we do not intend to sell any of the debt\nsecurities, and that it is more likely than not that we will not be required\nto sell, prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. We evaluate, where\nnecessary, whether credit impairment exists by comparing the present value of\nthe expected cash flows to the debt securities\u2019 amortized cost basis. Credit\nimpairment is recorded as an ACL for debt securities. For descriptions of the\nfactors we consider when analyzing debt securities for impairment as well as\nmethodology and significant inputs used to measure credit losses, see Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in our 2023 Form 10-K.\n                               \n  66    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nContractual Maturities Table 3.6 and Table 3.7 show the remaining contractual\nmaturities, amortized cost, net of the ACL, fair value and weighted average\neffective yields of AFS and HTM debt securities, respectively. The remaining\ncontractual principal maturities for mortgage-backed securities (MBS) do not\nconsider prepayments. Remaining expected maturities will differ from\ncontractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay\nobligations before the underlying mortgages mature.\n\nTable 3.6: Contractual

We also\noriginate multipurpose lending\ncommitments under which commercial\ncustomers have the option to draw on\nthe facility in one of several forms,\nincluding the issuance of letters of\ncredit, which reduces the unfunded\ncommitment amounts of the facility.\nThe maximum credit risk for these\ncommitments will generally be lower\nthan the contractual amount because\nthese commitments may expire without\nbeing used or may be cancelled at the\ncustomer\u2019s request. We may reduce or\ncancel lines of credit in accordance\nwith the contracts and applicable\nlaw. Our credit risk monitoring\nactivities include managing the\namount of commitments, both to\nindividual customers and in total,\nand the size and maturity structure\nof these commitments. We do not\nrecognize an ACL for commitments that\nare unconditionally cancellable at\nour discretion. We issue commercial\nletters of credit to assist customers\nin purchasing goods or services,\ntypically for international trade. At\nboth March 31, 2024, and December 31,\n2023, we had $ 1.1billion of\noutstanding issued commercial letters\nof credit. See Note 14 (Guarantees\nand Other Commitments) for additional\ninformation on issued standby letters\nof credit.\n\nWe may be a fronting bank, whereby we\nact as a representative for other\nlenders, and advance funds or provide\nfor the issuance of letters of credit\nunder syndicated loan or letter of\ncredit agreements. Any advances are\ngenerally repaid in less than a week\nand would normally require default of\nboth the customer and another lender\nto expose us to loss.\nThe contractual amount of our\nunfunded credit commitments,\nincluding unissued letters of credit,\nis summarized in Table 5.4.

Our ratings are aligned to\nregulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with the criticized\nsegmented among special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss categories.\nTable 5.7 provides the outstanding balances of our commercial loan portfolio\nby risk category and credit quality information by origination year for term\nloans. Revolving loans may convert to term loans as a result of a contractual\nprovision in the original loan agreement or if modified for a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty. At March 31, 2024, we had $ 503.9billion\nand $ 34.4billion of pass and criticized commercial loans, respectively.\nGross charge-offs by loan class are included in the following table for the\nquarter ended March 31, 2024, and year ended December 31, 2023, which we\nmonitor as part of our credit risk management practices; however, charge-offs\nare not a primary credit quality indicator for our loan portfolio.\n                               \n  74    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 5.7: Commercial Loan Categories by Risk Categories and Vintage\n

Loan delinquency, Fair Isaac Corporation\n(FICO) credit scores and loan-to-value (LTV) for residential mortgage loans\nare the primary credit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in our\nevaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL for the consumer loan portfolio\nsegment. Many of our loss estimation techniques used for the ACL for loans\nrely on delinquency-based models; therefore, delinquency is an important\nindicator of credit quality in the establishment of our ACL for consumer\nloans. We obtain FICO scores at loan origination and the scores are generally\nupdated at least quarterly, except in limited circumstances, including\ncompliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). FICO scores are not\navailable for certain loan types or may not be required if we deem it\nunnecessary due to strong collateral and other borrower attributes. LTV is\nthe ratio of the outstanding loan balance divided by the property collateral\nvalue. For junior lien mortgages, we use the total combined loan balance of\nfirst and junior lien mortgages (including unused line of credit amounts). We\nobtain LTVs using a cascade approach which first uses values provided by\nautomated valuation models (AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not\navailable, then the value is estimated using the original appraised value\nadjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the property location.\nIf an HPI is not available, the original appraised value is used. The HPI\nvalue is normally the only method considered for high value properties,\ngenerally with an original value of $ 1.5million or more, as the AVM values\nhave proven less accurate for these properties. Generally, we update LTVs on\na quarterly basis. Certain loans do not have an LTV due to a lack of industry\ndata availability and portfolios acquired from or serviced by other\ninstitutions. Gross charge-offs by loan class are included in the following\ntables for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and year ended December 31,\n2023, which we monitor as part of our credit risk management practices;\nhowever, charge-offs are not a primary credit quality indicator for our loan\nportfolio. Credit quality information is provided with the year of\norigination for term loans. Revolving loans may convert to term loans as a\nresult of a contractual provision in the original loan agreement or if\nmodified for a borrower experiencing financial difficulty.

These\nproceedings and investigations include actions brought against Wells Fargo\nand/or our subsidiaries with respect to corporate-related matters and\ntransactions in which Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries were involved. In\naddition, Wells Fargo and our subsidiaries may be requested to provide\ninformation to or otherwise cooperate with government authorities in the\nconduct of investigations of other persons or industry groups. We establish\naccruals for legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions\nbecome probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For such accruals,\nwe record the amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of\npotential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if we cannot\ndetermine a best estimate, then we record the low end of the range of those\npotential losses. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of\nlegal actions, including the matters described below, and the actual costs of\nresolving legal actions may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts\naccrued for those actions. ADVISORY ACCOUNT CASH SWEEP INVESTIGATION The\nUnited States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has undertaken an\ninvestigation regarding the cash sweep options that the Company provides to\ninvestment advisory clients at account opening. COMPANY 401(K) PLAN\nLITIGATION On September 26, 2022, participants in the Company\u2019s 401(k) plan\nfiled a putative class action in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Minnesota alleging that the Company violated the Employee\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 in connection with certain\ntransactions associated with the Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature of the\nCompany\u2019s 401(k) plan, including the manner in which the 401(k) plan\npurchased certain securities used in connection with the Company\u2019s\ncontributions to the 401(k) plan. HIRING PRACTICES MATTERS Government\nagencies, including the United States Department of Justice and the SEC, have\nundertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations regarding the\nCompany\u2019s hiring practices related to diversity. The United States Department\nof Justice and the SEC have since closed their investigations without taking\naction. A putative securities fraud class action has also been filed in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging\nthat the Company and certain of its executive officers made false or\nmisleading statements about the Company\u2019s hiring practices related to\ndiversity. Allegations related to the Company\u2019s hiring practices related to\ndiversity are also among the subjects of a shareholder derivative lawsuit\npending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia. INTERCHANGE LITIGATION Plaintiffs representing a class of\nmerchants have filed putative class actions, and individual merchants have\nfiled individual actions, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo &\nCompany, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and Wachovia Corporation regarding the\ninterchange fees associated with Visa and MasterCard payment card\ntransactions. Visa, MasterCard, and several other banks and bank holding\ncompanies are also named as defendants in these actions. These actions have\nbeen consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York. The amended and consolidated complaint asserts claims\nagainst defendants based on alleged violations of federal and state antitrust\nlaws and seeks damages as well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants\nallege that Visa, MasterCard, and payment card issuing banks unlawfully\ncolluded to set interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that enforcement of\ncertain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged tying and bundling of services\noffered to merchants are anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and Wachovia, along\nwith other defendants and entities, are parties to Loss and Judgment Sharing\nAgreements, which provide that they, along with other entities, will share,\nbased on a formula, in any losses from the Interchange Litigation. On July\n13, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and the financial institution defendants,\nincluding Wells Fargo, signed a memorandum of understanding with plaintiff\nmerchants to resolve the consolidated class action and reached a separate\nsettlement in principle of the consolidated individual actions. The\nsettlement payments to be made by all defendants in the consolidated class\nand individual actions totaled approximately $ 6.6billion before reductions\napplicable to certain merchants opting out of the settlement. The class\nsettlement also provided for the distribution to class merchants of 10 basis\npoints of default interchange across all credit rate categories for a period\nof eight consecutive months. The district court granted final approval of the\nsettlement, which was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit by settlement objector merchants. Other merchants opted out of\nthe settlement and are pursuing several individual actions. On June 30, 2016,\nthe Second Circuit vacated the settlement agreement and reversed and remanded\nthe consolidated action to the United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York for further proceedings. On November 30, 2016, the\ndistrict court appointed lead class counsel for a damages class and an\nequitable relief class. The parties have entered into a settlement agreement\nto resolve the damages class claims pursuant to which defendants will pay a\ntotal of approximately $ 6.2billion, which includes approximately $\n5.3billion of funds remaining from the 2012 settlement and $ 900million in\nadditional funding. The Company\u2019s allocated responsibility for the additional\nfunding is approximately $ 94.5million. The court granted final approval of\nthe settlement on December 13, 2019, which was appealed to the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector merchants. On\nMarch 15, 2023, the Second Circuit affirmed the damages class settlement. On\nSeptember 27, 2021, the district court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for\nclass certification in the equitable relief case. On March 26, 2024, Visa and\nMasterCard entered into a settlement agreement with the equitable relief\nclass to resolve the equitable relief class claims, which is subject to court\napproval. Several of the opt-out and direct action litigations have been\nsettled while others remain pending. RMBS TRUSTEE LITIGATION In December\n2014, Phoenix Light SF Limited (Phoenix Light) and certain related entities\nfiled a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its\ncapacity as trustee for a number of residential\n                               \n  90    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nmortgage-backed securities (RMBS)\ntrusts. Complaints raising similar\nallegations have been filed by\nCommerzbank AG in the Southern\nDistrict of New York, IKB\nInternational and IKB Deutsche\nIndustriebank (together, IKB) in New\nYork state court, and Park Royal I\nLLC and Park Royal II LLC in New York\nstate court. In each case, the\nplaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses\nto investors, and plaintiffs assert\ncauses of action based upon, among\nother things, the trustee\u2019s alleged\nfailure to notify and enforce\nrepurchase obligations of mortgage\nloan sellers for purported breaches\nof representations and warranties,\nnotify investors of alleged events of\ndefault, and abide by appropriate\nstandards of care following alleged\nevents of default. In July 2022, the\ndistrict court dismissed Phoenix\nLight\u2019s claims and certain of the\nclaims asserted by Commerzbank AG,\nand subsequently entered judgment in\neach case in favor of Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix\nLight and Commerzbank AG each\nappealed the district court\u2019s\ndecision to the United States Court\nof Appeals for the Second Circuit.\nPhoenix Light dismissed its appeal in\nMay 2023, terminating its case. In\nNovember 2023, the Company entered\ninto an agreement with IKB to resolve\nIKB\u2019s claims. The Company previously\nsettled twoclass actions filed by\ninstitutional investors and an action\nfiled by the National Credit Union\nAdministration with similar\nallegations. SEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE\nLITIGATION The Seminole Tribe of\nFlorida filed a complaint in Florida\nstate court alleging that Wells\nFargo, as trustee, charged excess\nfees in connection with the\nadministration of a minor\u2019s trust and\nfailed to invest the assets of the\ntrust prudently. The complaint was\nlater amended to include\nthreeindividual current and former\nbeneficiaries as plaintiffs and to\nremove the Tribe as a party to the\ncase. ZELLE INVESTIGATION Government\nauthorities have been conducting\nformal or informal inquiries or\ninvestigations regarding the handling\nof customer disputes related to fund\ntransfers made through the Zelle\nNetwork.\n\nOUTLOOK As described above, the\nCompany establishes accruals for\nlegal actions when potential losses\nassociated with the actions become\nprobable and the costs can be\nreasonably estimated. The high end of\nthe range of reasonably possible\nlosses in excess of the Company\u2019s\naccrual for probable and estimable\nlosses was approximately $ 1.8billion\nas of March 31, 2024. The outcomes of\nlegal actions are unpredictable and\nsubject to significant uncertainties,\nand it is inherently difficult to\ndetermine whether any loss is\nprobable or even possible. It is also\ninherently difficult to estimate the\namount of any loss and there may be\nmatters for which a loss is probable\nor reasonably possible but not\ncurrently estimable. Accordingly,\nactual losses may be in excess of the\nestablished accrual or the range of\nreasonably possible loss. Based on\ninformation currently available,\nadvice of counsel, available\ninsurance coverage, and established\nreserves, Wells Fargo believes that\nthe eventual outcome of the actions\nagainst Wells Fargo and/or its\nsubsidiaries will not, individually\nor in the aggregate, have a material\nadverse effect on Wells Fargo\u2019s\nconsolidated financial condition.\nHowever, it is possible that the\nultimate resolution of a matter, if\nunfavorable, may be material to Wells\nFargo\u2019s results of operations for any\nparticular period.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    91  \n                               \n                       \n  Note 11:Derivatives  \n                       \nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including interest rate\nrisk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to assist customers with\ntheir risk management objectives. We designate certain derivatives as hedging\ninstruments in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (fair value or cash\nflow hedges). Our remaining derivatives consist of economic hedges that do\nnot qualify for hedge accounting and derivatives held for customer\naccommodation trading purposes.

Table 11.1\npresents the total notional or contractual amounts and fair values for our\nderivatives. Derivative transactions can be measured in terms of the notional\namount, but this amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and\nis not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of\nthe instruments.

\nBalance Sheet Offsetting We execute substantially all of our derivative\ntransactions under master netting arrangements. Where legally enforceable,\nthese master netting arrangements give the ability, in the event of default\nby the counterparty, to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset\nreceivables and payables with the same counterparty. We reflect all\nderivative balances and related cash collateral subject to enforceable master\nnetting arrangements on a net basis on our consolidated balance sheet. We do\nnot net non-cash collateral that we receive or pledge against derivative\nbalances on our consolidated balance sheet. For disclosure purposes, we\npresent \u201cTotal Derivatives, net\u201d which represents the aggregate of our net\nexposure to each counterparty after considering the balance sheet netting\nadjustments and any non-cash collateral. We manage derivative exposure by\nmonitoring the credit risk associated with each counterparty using\ncounterparty-specific credit risk limits, using master netting arrangements\nand obtaining collateral. Table 11.2 provides information on the fair values\nof derivative assets and liabilities subject to enforceable master netting\narrangements, the balance sheet netting adjustments and the resulting net\nfair value amount recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as the\nnon-cash collateral associated with such arrangements. In addition to the\nnetting amounts included in the table, we also have balance sheet netting\nrelated to resale and repurchase agreements that are disclosed within Note 15\n(Securities and Other

We also enter into cross-currency swaps, cross-currency interest\nrate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency\nrisk and interest rate risk associated with the issuance of non-U.S. dollar\ndenominated long-term debt. We also enter into futures contracts, forward\ncontracts, and swap contracts to hedge our exposure to the price risk of\nphysical commodities included in other assets on our consolidated balance\nsheet. In addition, we use interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, cross-\ncurrency interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge against changes\nin fair value of certain investments in AFS debt securities due to changes in\ninterest rates, foreign currency rates, or both. For certain fair value\nhedges of interest rate risk, we use the portfolio layer method to hedge\nstated amounts of closed portfolios of AFS debt securities. For certain fair\nvalue hedges of foreign currency risk, changes in fair value of cross-\ncurrency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency basis spreads are\nexcluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded in other\ncomprehensive income (OCI). See Note 21 (Other Comprehensive Income) for the\namounts recognized in other comprehensive income. For cash flow hedges, we\nuse interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest payments\nreceived on certain interest-earning deposits with banks and certain\nfloating-rate commercial loans. We also use cross-currency swaps to hedge\nvariability in interest payments on fixed-rate foreign currency-denominated\nlong-term debt due to changes in foreign exchange rates. We estimate $\n797million pre-tax of deferred net losses related to cash flow hedges in OCI\nat March 31, 2024, will be reclassified into net interest income during the\nnext twelve months. For cash flow hedges as of March 31, 2024, we are hedging\nour interest rate and foreign currency exposure to the variability of future\ncash flows for all forecasted transactions for a maximum of approximately\n8years. For additional information on our accounting hedges, see Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Assets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value on a recurring\nbasis, such as derivatives,\nresidential MSRs, and trading or AFS\ndebt securities, are presented in\nTable 12.1 in this Note.\nAdditionally, from time to time, we\nrecord fair value adjustments on a\nnonrecurring basis. These\nnonrecurring adjustments typically\ninvolve application of lower of cost\nor fair value (LOCOM) accounting,\nwrite-downs of individual assets or\napplication of the measurement\nalternative for nonmarketable equity\nsecurities. Assets recorded at fair\nvalue on a nonrecurring basis are\npresented in Table 12.4 in this Note.\nWe provide in Table 12.9 estimates of\nfair value for financial instruments\nthat are not recorded at fair value,\nsuch as loans and debt liabilities\ncarried at amortized cost. See Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies) in our 2023 Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of how we determine fair\nvalue. For descriptions of the\nvaluation methodologies we use for\nassets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value on a recurring or\nnonrecurring basis, see Note 15 (\nFair Values of Assets and\nLiabilities) in our 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY We classify our\nassets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value as either Level 1, 2, or 3\nin the fair value hierarchy. The\nhighest priority (Level 1) is\nassigned to valuations based on\nunadjusted quoted prices in active\nmarkets and the lowest priority\n(Level 3) is assigned to valuations\nbased on significant unobservable\ninputs. See Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) in\nour 2023 Form 10-K for a detailed\ndescription of the fair value\nhierarchy. In the determination of\nthe classification of financial\ninstruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy, we consider\nall available information, including\nobservable market data, indications\nof market liquidity and orderliness,\nand our understanding of the\nvaluation techniques and significant\ninputs used. This determination is\nultimately based upon the specific\nfacts and circumstances of each\ninstrument or instrument category and\njudgments are made regarding the\nsignificance of the unobservable\ninputs to the instruments\u2019 fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety. If\nunobservable inputs are considered\nsignificant, the instrument is\nclassified as Level 3. We do not\nclassify nonmarketable equity\nsecurities in the fair value\nhierarchy if we use the non-published\nnet asset value (NAV) per share (or\nits equivalent) as a practical\nexpedient to measure fair value.\nMarketable equity securities with\npublished NAVs are classified in the\nfair value hierarchy.\n                               \n  98    Wells Fargo & Company  \n

We may elect the fair value option to align the\nmeasurement model with how the financial assets or liabilities are managed or\nto reduce complexity or accounting asymmetry.

performing loans, instrument-\nspecific credit risk gains or losses\nare derived principally by\ndetermining the change in fair value\nof the loans due to changes in the\nobservable or implied credit spread.\nCredit spread is the market yield on\nthe loans less the relevant risk-free\nbenchmark interest rate. For\nnonperforming loans, we attribute all\nchanges in fair value to instrument-\nspecific credit risk. For LHFS\naccounted for under the fair value\noption, instrument-specific credit\ngains or losses were insignificant\nduring the first quarter of both 2024\nand 2023.\n\nFor interest-bearing deposits and\nlong-term debt, instrument-specific\ncredit risk gains or losses represent\nthe impact of changes in fair value\ndue to changes in our credit spread\nand are generally derived using\nobservable secondary bond market\ninformation. These impacts are\nrecorded within the debit valuation\nadjustments (DVA) in OCI. See Note 21\n(Other Comprehensive Income) for\nadditional information.\n                                \n  104    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nDisclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments Table 12.9 presents a\nsummary of fair value estimates for financial instruments that are not\ncarried at fair value on a recurring basis. Some financial instruments are\nexcluded from the scope of this table, such as certain insurance contracts,\ncertain nonmarketable equity securities, and leases. This table also excludes\nassets and liabilities that are not financial instruments such as the value\nof the long-term relationships with our deposit, credit card and trust\ncustomers, MSRs, premises and equipment, goodwill and deferred taxes. Loan\ncommitments, standby letters of credit and commercial and similar letters of\ncredit are not included in Table 12.9. A reasonable estimate of the fair\nvalue of these instruments is the carrying value of deferred fees plus the\nallowance for unfunded credit commitments, which totaled $ 536million and $\n575million at March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The total\nof the fair value calculations presented does not represent, and should not\nbe construed to represent, the underlying fair value of the Company.\n\nTable 12.9: Fair Value Estimates for

into various types of on- and off-balance sheet\ntransactions with special purpose entities (SPEs), which are corporations,\ntrusts, limited liability companies or partnerships that are established for\na limited purpose. SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization\ntransactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE. SPEs formed\nin connection with securitization transactions are generally considered\nvariable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE may alter the risk profile of the\nasset by entering into derivative transactions or obtaining credit support,\nand issues various forms of interests in those assets to investors. When we\ntransfer financial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in\nconnection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and sometimes\nother interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets we transfer. In certain\ntransactions with VIEs, we may retain the right to service the transferred\nassets and repurchase the transferred assets if the outstanding balance of\nthe assets falls below the level at which the cost to service the assets\nexceed the benefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans\ntransferred to a VIE by a third party. In connection with our securitization\nor other VIE activities, we have various forms of ongoing involvement with\nVIEs, which may include: \u2022 underwriting securities issued by VIEs and\nsubsequently making markets in those securities; \u2022 providing credit\nenhancement on securities issued by VIEs through the use of letters of credit\nor financial guarantees; \u2022 entering into other derivative contracts with\nVIEs; \u2022 holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs; \u2022 acting as\nservicer or investment manager for VIEs; \u2022 providing administrative or\ntrustee services to VIEs; and \u2022 providing seller financing to VIEs. Loan\nSales and Securitization Activity We periodically transfer consumer and\ncommercial loans and other types of financial assets in securitization and\nwhole loan sale transactions. MORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO GOVERNMENT SPONSORED\nENTERPRISES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE In the normal course of business\nwe sell residential and commercial mortgage loans to GSEs. These loans are\ngenerally transferred into securitizations sponsored by the GSEs, which\nprovide certain credit guarantees to investors and servicers. We also\ntransfer mortgage loans into securitization pools pursuant to Government\nNational Mortgage Association (GNMA) guidelines which are insured by the FHA\nor guaranteed by the VA. Mortgage loans eligible for securitization with the\nGSEs or GNMA are considered conforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA design the\nstructure of these securitizations, sponsor the involved VIEs, and have power\nover the activities most significant to the VIE. We account for loans\ntransferred in conforming mortgage loan securitization transactions as sales\nand do not consolidate the VIEs as we are not the primary beneficiary. In\nexchange for the transfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by\nthe VIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for investment\npurposes as HTM or AFS securities. We also retain servicing rights on the\ntransferred loans. As a servicer, we retain the option to repurchase loans\nfrom certain loan securitizations, which becomes exercisable based on\ndelinquency status such as when three scheduled loan payments are past due.\nWhen we have the unilateral option to repurchase a loan, we recognize the\nloan and a corresponding liability on our balance sheet regardless of our\nintent to repurchase the loan, and the loans remain pledged to the\nsecuritization. At March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we recorded assets\nand related liabilities of $ 1.2billion and $ 1.0billion, respectively, where\nwe did not exercise our option to repurchase eligible loans. We repurchased\nloans of $ 90million and $ 92million during the first quarter of 2024 and\n2023, respectively. Upon transfers of loans, we also provide indemnification\nfor losses incurred due to material breaches of contractual representations\nand warranties as well as other recourse arrangements. At March 31, 2024, and\nDecember 31, 2023, our liability for these repurchase and recourse\narrangements was $ 194million and $ 229million, respectively, and the maximum\nexposure to loss was $ 13.6billion at both March 31, 2024, and December 31,\n2023, respectively. Substantially all residential servicing activity is\nrelated to assets transferred to GSE and GNMA securitizations. See Note 6\n(Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information about residential\nand commercial servicing rights, advances and servicing fees. NONCONFORMING\nMORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS In the normal course of business, we sell\nnonconforming mortgage loans in securitization transactions that we design\nand sponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations do not involve a\ngovernment credit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial interest holders are\nsubject to credit risk of the underlying assets held by the securitization\nVIE. We typically originate the transferred loans and account for the\ntransfers as sales. We also typically retain the right to service the loans\nand may hold other beneficial interests issued by the VIE, such as debt\nsecurities held for investment purposes. Our servicing role related to\nnonconforming commercial mortgage loan securitizations is limited to primary\nor master servicer. We do not consolidate the VIE because the most\nsignificant decisions impacting the performance of the VIE are generally made\nby the special servicer or the controlling class security holder. For our\nresidential nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations accounted for as\nsales, we either do not hold variable interests that we consider potentially\nsignificant or are not the primary servicer for a majority of the VIE assets.\nWHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We may also sell whole loans to VIEs where we\nhave continuing involvement in the form of financing. We account for these\ntransfers as sales, and do not consolidate the VIEs as we do not have the\npower to direct the most significant activities of the VIEs. Table 13.1\npresents information about transfers of assets during the periods presented\nfor which we recorded the transfers as sales and have continuing involvement\nwith the transferred assets. In connection with these transfers, we received\nproceeds and recorded servicing assets and securities. Each of these\ninterests are initially measured at fair value. Servicing rights are\nclassified as Level 3 measurements, and generally securities are classified\nas Level 2. The majority of our transfers relate to residential mortgage\nsecuritizations with the GSEs or GNMA and generally result in nogain or loss\nbecause the loans are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nAdditionally, we may transfer certain government insured loans that we\npreviously\n                                \n  106    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nrepurchased. These loans are carried at the lower of cost or market, and we\nrecognize gains on such transfers when the market value is greater than the\ncarrying value of the loan when it is sold.\n\nTable 13.1: Transfers with Continuing Involvement\n                                                                             \n  (in                                                                        \n  mil\u2026                                                                       \n  Qua\u2026                                                                       \n  end\u2026                               2024                             2023   \n  Mar\u2026              Resid\u2026           Comm\u2026           Resid\u2026           Comm\u2026  \n  31,               mortg\u2026           mort\u2026           mortg\u2026           mort\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Ass\u2026    $  1,684            1,549           4,461            1,499         \n  sold                                                                       \n  Pro\u2026                                                                       \n  from       1,684            1,570           4,461            1,540         \n  tra\u2026                                                                       \n  (1)                                                                        \n  Net                                                                        \n  gai\u2026                                                                       \n  (lo\u2026           \u2014               21               \u2014               41         \n  on                                                                         \n  sale                                                                       \n  Con\u2026                                                                       \n  inv\u2026                                                                       \n  (2):                                                                       \n  Ser\u2026                                                                       \n  rig\u2026    $     16               10              47               18         \n  rec\u2026                                                                       \n  Sec\u2026                                                                       \n  rec\u2026           \u2014                \u2014               \u2014               26         \n  (3)                                                                        \n                                                                             \n(1) Represents cash proceeds and the\nfair value of non-cash beneficial\ninterests recognized at\nsecuritization settlement.\n\n(2) Represents assets or liabilities\nrecognized at securitization\nsettlement date related to our\ncontinuing involvement in the\ntransferred assets.\n\n(3) Represents debt securities\nobtained at securitization settlement\nheld for investment purposes that are\nclassified as available-for-sale or\nheld-to-maturity.

In resecuritization transactions, we\ntransfer trading debt securities to VIEs in exchange for new beneficial\ninterests that are sold to third parties at or shortly after securitization\nsettlement. This activity is performed for customers seeking a specific\nreturn or risk profile. Substantially all of our transactions involve the\nresecuritization of conforming mortgage-backed securities issued by the GSEs\nor guaranteed by GNMA. We do not consolidate the resecuritization VIEs as we\nshare in the decision-making power with third parties and do not hold\nsignificant economic interests in the VIEs other than for market-making\nactivities. During the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we transferred\nsecurities of $ 2.7billion and $ 3.2billion, respectively, to\nresecuritization VIEs, and retained $ 229million and $ 198million,\nrespectively. These amounts are not included in Table 13.1. Related total VIE\nassets were $ 110.4billion at both March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023. As\nof March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we held $ 583million and $\n984million of securities, respectively.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    107  \n                                \nNote 13: Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities (continued)\n\nSold or Securitized Loans Serviced for Others Table 13.3 presents information\nabout loans that we have originated and sold or securitized in which we have\nongoing involvement as servicer. For loans sold or securitized where\nservicing is our only form of continuing involvement, we generally experience\na loss only if we were required to repurchase a delinquent loan or foreclosed\nasset due to a breach in representations and warranties associated with our\nloan sale or servicing contracts. Table 13.3 excludes mortgage loans sold to\nand held or securitized by GSEs or GNMA of $ 564.0billion and $ 592.5billion\nat March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Delinquent loans\ninclude loans 90 days or more past due and loans in bankruptcy, regardless of\ndelinquency status. Delinquent loans and foreclosed assets related to loans\nsold to and held or securitized by GSEs and GNMA were $ 2.9billion and $\n3.4billion at March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nTable 13.3: Sold or Securitized Loans Serviced for Others\n                                                                             \n                                                    De\u2026                      \n                                                    lo\u2026                      \n                                                    and                 Net  \n                                                    fo\u2026                 ch\u2026  \n                            To\u2026                     as\u2026                 Qu\u2026  \n                            lo\u2026                     (1)                 en\u2026  \n                Mar         Dec         Mar         Dec                 Ma\u2026  \n  (\u2026            31,         31,         31,         31,                 31,  \n  m\u2026            20\u2026         20\u2026         20\u2026         20\u2026       2\u2026        20\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  C\u2026    $  68\u2026         67\u2026         894         1,\u2026         5        14       \n  R\u2026       8,\u2026         8,\u2026         368         393         2         5       \n  T\u2026                                                                         \n  o\u2026                                                                         \n  s\u2026                                                                         \n  s\u2026    $  76\u2026         75\u2026         1,\u2026         1,\u2026         7        19       \n  or                                                                         \n  s\u2026                                                                         \n  l\u2026                                                                         \n                                                                             \n(1) Includes $ 159million and $ 163million of commercial foreclosed assets\nand $ 20million and $ 22million of residential foreclosed assets at March 31,\n2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nTransactions with Unconsolidated VIEs MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS Table\n13.4 includes nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations where we originate\nand transfer the loans to the unconsolidated securitization VIEs that we\nsponsor. For additional information about these VIEs, see the \u201cLoan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity\u201d section within this Note. Nonconforming mortgage\nloan securitizations also include commercial mortgage loan securitizations\nsponsored by third parties where we did not originate or transfer the loans\nbut serve as master servicer and invest in securities that could be\npotentially significant to the VIE. Conforming loan securitization and\nresecuritization transactions involving the GSEs and GNMA are excluded from\nTable 13.4 because we are not the sponsor or we do not have power over the\nactivities most significant to the VIEs. Additionally, due to the nature of\nthe guarantees provided by the GSEs and the FHA and VA, our credit risk\nassociated with these VIEs is limited. For additional information about\nconforming mortgage loan securitizations and resecuritizations, see the \u201cLoan\nSales and Securitization Activity\u201d and \u201cResecuritization Activities\u201d sections\nwithin this Note. COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS We may transfer purchased\nindustrial development bonds and GSE credit enhancements to VIEs in exchange\nfor beneficial interests. We may also acquire such beneficial interests in\ntransactions where we do not act as a transferor. We own all of the\nbeneficial interests and may also service the underlying mortgages that serve\nas collateral to the bonds. The GSEs have the power to direct the servicing\nand workout activities of the VIE in the event of a default, therefore we do\nnot have control over the key decisions of the VIEs. OTHER VIE STRUCTURES We\nengage in various forms of structured finance arrangements with other VIEs,\nincluding asset-backed finance structures and other securitizations\ncollateralized by asset classes other than mortgages. Collateral may include\nrental properties, asset-backed securities, student loans and mortgage loans.\nWe may participate in structuring or marketing the arrangements as well as\nprovide financing, service one or more of the underlying assets, or enter\ninto derivatives with the VIEs. We may also receive fees for those services.\nWe are not the primary beneficiary of these structures because we do not have\npower to direct the most significant activities of the VIEs. Table 13.4\nprovides a summary of our exposure to the unconsolidated VIEs described\nabove, which includes investments in securities, loans, guarantees, liquidity\nagreements, commitments and certain derivatives. We exclude certain\ntransactions with unconsolidated VIEs when our continuing involvement is\ntemporary or administrative in nature or insignificant in size. In Table\n13.4, \u201cTotal VIE assets\u201d represents the remaining principal balance of assets\nheld by unconsolidated VIEs using the most current information available.\n\u201cCarrying value\u201d is the amount in our consolidated balance sheet related to\nour involvement with the unconsolidated VIEs. \u201cMaximum exposure to loss\u201d is\ndetermined as the carrying value of our investment in the VIEs excluding the\nunconditional repurchase options that have not been exercised, plus the\nremaining undrawn liquidity and lending commitments, the notional amount of\nnet written derivative contracts, and generally the notional amount of, or\nstressed loss estimate for, other commitments and guarantees.

energy or similar projects that are designed to generate a return\nprimarily through the realization of federal income tax credits and other\nincome tax benefits. Our affordable housing investments generate low-income\nhousing tax credits and our renewable energy investments generate either\nproduction tax credits, investment tax credits, or both. The projects are\ntypically managed by third-party sponsors who have the power over the VIE\u2019s\nassets; therefore, we do not consolidate the VIEs. The carrying value of our\nequity investments in tax credit VIEs was $ 20.9billion and $ 19.7billion at\nMarch 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Additionally, we had\nloans to tax credit VIEs with a carrying value of $ 2.0billion and $\n2.1billion at March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our\nmaximum exposure to loss for tax credit VIEs at March 31, 2024, and December\n31, 2023, was $ 29.8billion and $ 30.6billion, respectively. Our maximum\nexposure to loss included total unfunded equity and lending commitments of $\n6.9billion and $ 8.7billion at March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. Under these commitments, we are required to provide additional\nfinancial support during the investment period, at the discretion of project\nsponsors, or for certain renewable energy investments, on a contingent basis\nbased on the amount of income tax credits earned. For equity investments\naccounted for using the proportional amortization method, a liability is\nrecognized for unfunded commitments that are either legally binding or\ncontingent but probable of funding. The liability recognized for these\ncommitments at March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was $ 7.2billion and $\n4.9billion, respectively. Substantially all of these commitments are expected\nto be funded within three years. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) for additional information on our adoption of ASU\n2023-02 effective January 1, 2024, which impacted the accounting for our tax\ncredit equity investments and related unfunded commitments.

Prior period\nbalances in this table do not reflect accounting changes related to our\nadoption of ASU 2023-02 , effective January 1, 2024. For additional\ninformation, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).\n\n(2) Loss before income tax expense predominantly relates to equity method\nlosses from renewable energy tax credit investments, which are recorded in\nother noninterest income on our consolidated statement of income.\n\nConsolidated VIEs We consolidate VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary.\nWe are the primary beneficiary of the following structure types: COMMERCIAL\nAND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASES We previously securitized dealer floor plan\nloans in a revolving master trust entity. As servicer and holder of all\nbeneficial interests, we control the key decisions of the trust and\nconsolidate the VIE. In first quarter 2024, we removed the loans held by the\nmaster trust entity by transferring them to another subsidiary of Wells\nFargo, which had no impact on our consolidated balance sheet. In a separate\ntransaction structure, we may provide the majority of debt and equity\nfinancing to an SPE that engages in lending and leasing to specific vendors\nand we service the underlying collateral. CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS In\nfirst quarter 2024, we securitized a portion of our credit card loans to\nprovide a source of funding. Credit card securitizations involve the transfer\nof credit card loans to a master trust that issues debt securities to third\nparty investors that are collateralized by the transferred credit card loans.\nThe underlying securitized credit card loans and other assets in the master\ntrust are available only for payment of the debt securities issued by the\nmaster trust; they are not available to pay our other obligations. In\naddition, the investors in the debt securities do not have recourse to the\ngeneral credit of Wells Fargo. We consolidate the master trust because, as\nthe servicer of the credit card loans, we have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the economic performance and hold\nvariable interests potentially significant to the VIE. We hold a minimum of\n5% seller\u2019s interest in the transferred credit card loans and we retain\nsubordinated securities issued by the master trust, which collectively could\nresult in exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits from the\nmaster trust. As of March 31, 2024, we held seller\u2019s interest of $ 1.7billion\nin the transferred credit card loans and subordinated securities of $\n750million (at par) issued by the master trust, which are both eliminated in\nour consolidated financial statements. The transferred credit card loans and\ndebt securities issued to third parties are recognized on our consolidated\nbalance sheet, and classified as loans and long-term debt, respectively.\nTable 13.6 presents a summary of financial assets and liabilities of our\nconsolidated VIEs. The carrying value represents assets and liabilities\nrecognized on our consolidated balance sheet. \u201cTotal VIE assets\u201d includes\naffiliate balances that are eliminated upon consolidation, and therefore in\nsome instances will differ from the carrying value of assets. On our\nconsolidated balance sheet, we separately disclose (1) the consolidated\nassets of certain VIEs that can only be used to settle the liabilities of\nthose VIEs, and (2) the consolidated liabilities of certain VIEs for which\nthe VIE creditors do not have recourse to Wells Fargo.\n\nTable 13.6: Transactions with Consolidated VIEs\n                                                                             \n  (in                      Carr\u2026                                             \n  mi\u2026                      value               All                      All  \n  Ma\u2026              Tot\u2026        \u2013               other                   oth\u2026  \n  31,              VIE     asset               asse\u2026          Long\u2026    lia\u2026  \n  20\u2026              ass\u2026    (lia\u2026  Loa\u2026         (1)            debt      (2)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Co\u2026                                                                        \n  and                                                                        \n  in\u2026    $  1,595          1,416          179              \u2014           -121  \n  lo\u2026                                                                        \n  and                                                                        \n  le\u2026                                                                        \n  Cr\u2026                                                                        \n  ca\u2026       3,846          3,726           15           -1,\u2026             -5  \n  se\u2026                                                                        \n  Ot\u2026         310              \u2014          306              \u2014              \u2014  \n  To\u2026                                                                        \n  co\u2026    $  5,751          5,142          500           -1,\u2026           -126  \n  VI\u2026                                                                        \n  De\u2026                                                                        \n  31,                                                                        \n  20\u2026                                                                        \n  Co\u2026                                                                        \n  and                                                                        \n  in\u2026    $  7,579          4,880          203              \u2014           -115  \n  lo\u2026                                                                        \n  and                                                                        \n  le\u2026                                                                        \n  Cr\u2026                                                                        \n  ca\u2026           \u2014              \u2014            \u2014              \u2014              \u2014  \n  se\u2026                                                                        \n  Ot\u2026         232              \u2014          232              \u2014              \u2014  \n  To\u2026                                                                        \n  co\u2026    $  7,811          4,880          435              \u2014           -115  \n  VI\u2026                                                                        \n                                                                             \n(1) All other assets includes loans held for sale and other assets.\n\n(2) All other liabilities include short-term borrowings, and accrued expenses\nand other liabilities.\n                                \n  110    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nOther Transactions In addition to the transactions included in the previous\ntables, we have used wholly-owned trust preferred security VIEs to issue debt\nsecurities or preferred equity exclusively to third-party investors.

participations.\nMaximum exposure to loss represents the estimated loss that would be incurred\nunder an assumed hypothetical circumstance, despite what we believe is a\nremote possibility, where the value of our interests and any associated\ncollateral declines to zero. Maximum exposure to loss estimates in Table 14.1\ndo not reflect economic hedges or collateral we could use to offset or\nrecover losses we may incur under our guarantee agreements. Accordingly,\nthese amounts are not an indication of expected loss. We believe the carrying\nvalue is more representative of our current exposure to loss than maximum\nexposure to loss. The carrying value represents the fair value of the\nguarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL for guarantees, if applicable. In\ndetermining the ACL for guarantees, we consider the credit risk of the\nrelated contingent obligation. For our guarantees in Table 14.1, non-\ninvestment grade represents those guarantees on which we have a higher risk\nof performance under the terms of the guarantee, which is determined based on\nan external rating or an internal credit grade that is below investment\ngrade, if applicable. WRITTEN OPTIONS We enter into written foreign currency\noptions and over-the-counter written equity put options that are derivative\ncontracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee. The fair value of\nwritten options represents our view of the probability that we will be\nrequired to perform under the contract. The fair value of these written\noptions was an asset of $ 332million and $ 178million at March 31, 2024, and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. The fair value may be an asset as a result\nof deferred premiums on certain option trades. The maximum exposure to loss\nrepresents the notional value of these derivative contracts. At March 31,\n2024, the maximum exposure to loss was $ 31.6billion, with $ 29.1billion\nexpiring in three years or less compared with $ 34.0billion and $\n31.9billion, respectively, at December 31, 2023. See Note 11 (Derivatives)\nfor additional information regarding written derivative contracts. MERCHANT\nPROCESSING SERVICES We provide debit and credit card transaction processing\nservices through payment networks directly for merchants and as a sponsor for\nmerchant processing servicers, including our joint venture with a third party\nthat is accounted for as an equity method investment. In our role as the\nmerchant acquiring bank, we have a potential obligation in connection with\npayment and delivery disputes between the merchant and the cardholder that\nare resolved in favor of the cardholder, referred to as a charge-back\ntransaction. We estimate our potential maximum exposure to be the total\nmerchant transaction volume processed in the preceding four months, which is\ngenerally the lifecycle for a charge-back transaction. As of March 31, 2024,\nour potential maximum exposure was approximately $ 728.4billion, and related\nlosses, including those from our joint venture entity, were insignificant.\nGUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES The Parent fully and unconditionally guarantees\nthe payment of principal, interest, and any other amounts that may be due on\nsecurities that its 100% owned finance subsidiary, Wells Fargo Finance LLC,\nmay issue.These securities are not guaranteed by any other subsidiary of the\nParent. The guaranteed liabilities were $ 1.1billion and $ 834million at\nMarch 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. These guarantees rank on\nparity with all of the Parent\u2019s other unsecured and unsubordinated\nindebtedness. OTHER COMMITMENTS As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023,\nwe had commitments to purchase equity securities of $ 7.4billion and $\n9.2billion, respectively, which predominantly included Federal Reserve Bank\nstock and tax credit investments accounted for using the equity method. As\npart of maintaining our memberships in certain clearing organizations, we are\nrequired to stand ready to provide liquidity to sustain market clearing\nactivity in the event unforeseen events occur or are deemed likely to occur.\nCertain of these\n                                \n  112    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nobligations are guarantees of other\nmembers\u2019 performance and accordingly\nare included in Table 14.1 in Other\nguarantees and indemnifications. We\nhave commitments to enter into resale\nand securities borrowing agreements\nas well as repurchase and securities\nlending agreements with certain\ncounterparties, including central\nclearing organizations. The amount of\nour unfunded contractual commitments\nfor resale and securities borrowing\nagreements was $ 16.1billion and $\n17.5billion as of March 31, 2024, and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. The\namount of our unfunded contractual\ncommitments for repurchase and\nsecurities lending agreements was $\n1.9billion and $ 746million as of\nMarch 31, 2024, and December 31,\n2023, respectively. Given the nature\nof these commitments, they are\nexcluded from Table 5.4 (Unfunded\nCredit Commitments) in Note 5 (Loans\nand Related Allowance for Credit\nLosses).\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    113  \n                                \n                                               \n  Note 15:Securities and Other Collateralized  \n  Financing Activities                         \n                                               \nWe enter into resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and\nlending agreements (collectively, \u201csecurities financing activities\u201d)\ntypically to finance trading positions (including securities and\nderivatives), acquire securities to cover short trading positions,\naccommodate customers\u2019 financing needs, and settle other securities\nobligations. These activities are conducted through our broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, through other bank entities. Our\nsecurities financing activities primarily involve high-quality, liquid\nsecurities such as U.S. Treasury securities and government agency securities\nand, to a lesser extent, less liquid securities, including equity securities,\ncorporate bonds and asset-backed securities. We account for these\ntransactions as collateralized financings in which we typically receive or\npledge securities as collateral. We believe these financing transactions\ngenerally do not have material credit risk given the collateral provided and\nthe related monitoring processes. We also enter into resale agreements\ninvolving collateral other than securities, such as loans, as part of our\ncommercial lending business activities. OFFSETTING OF SECURITIES AND OTHER\nCOLLATERALIZED FINANCING ACTIVITIES Table 15.1 presents resale and repurchase\nagreements subject to master repurchase agreements (MRA) and securities\nborrowing and lending agreements subject to master securities lending\nagreements (MSLA). Where legally enforceable, these master netting\narrangements give the ability, in the event of default by the counterparty,\nto liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and\npayables with the same counterparty. Collateralized financings with the same\ncounterparty are presented net on our consolidated balance sheet, provided\ncertain criteria are met that permit balance sheet netting. The majority of\ntransactions subject to these agreements do not meet those criteria and thus\nare not eligible for balance sheet netting. Collateral we pledged consists of\nnon-cash instruments, such as securities or loans, and is not netted on our\nconsolidated balance sheet against the related liability. Collateral we\nreceived includes securities or loans and is not recognized on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. Collateral pledged or received may be increased\nor decreased over time to maintain certain contractual thresholds, as the\nassets underlying each arrangement fluctuate in value. For additional\ninformation on collateral pledged and accepted, see Note 16 (Pledged Assets\nand Collateral). Generally, these agreements require collateral to exceed the\nasset or liability recognized on the balance sheet. The following table\nincludes the amount of collateral pledged or received related to exposures\nsubject to enforceable MRAs or MSLAs. While these agreements are typically\nover-collateralized, the disclosure in this table is limited to the reported\namount of such collateral to the amount of the related recognized asset or\nliability for each counterparty. In addition to the amounts included in Table\n15.1, we also have balance sheet netting related to derivatives that is\ndisclosed in Note 11 (Derivatives).\nTable 15.1: Offsetting \u2013 Securities and Other Collateralized Financing\nActivities\n                                                                             \n                                                Mar 31,             Dec 31,  \n  (in millions)                                 2024                2023     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Assets:                                                                    \n  Resale and securities                                                      \n  borrowing                                                                  \n  agreements                                                                 \n  Gross amounts recognized          $  119,050             129,282           \n  Gross amounts offset in                                                    \n  consolidated                         -30,969             -28,402           \n  balance sheet (1)                                                          \n  Net amounts in consolidated                                                \n  balance                               88,081             100,880           \n  sheet (2)                                                                  \n  Collateral received not                                                    \n  recognized in                        -87,344             -99,970           \n  consolidated balance sheet (3)                                             \n  Net amount (4)                    $      737                 910           \n  Liabilities:                                                               \n  Repurchase and securities                                                  \n  lending                                                                    \n  agreements                                                                 \n  Gross amounts recognized          $  117,444             106,060           \n  Gross amounts offset in                                                    \n  consolidated                         -30,969             -28,402           \n  balance sheet (1)                                                          \n  Net amounts in consolidated                                                \n  balance                               86,475              77,658           \n  sheet (5)                                                                  \n  Collateral pledged but not                                                 \n  netted in                            -86,420             -77,529           \n  consolidated balance sheet (6)                                             \n  Net amount (4)                    $       55                 129           \n                                                                             \n(1) Represents recognized amount of resale and repurchase agreements with\ncounterparties subject to enforceable MRAs that have been offset within our\nconsolidated balance sheet.\n(2) Includes $ 68.7billion and $ 80.4billion classified on our consolidated\nbalance sheet in federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale\nagreements at March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.

In these transactions, we receive cash in exchange\nfor transferring securities as collateral and recognize an obligation to\nreacquire the securities for cash at the transaction\u2019s maturity. These types\nof transactions create risks, including (1) the counterparty may fail to\nreturn the securities at maturity, (2) the fair value of the securities\ntransferred may decline below the amount of our obligation to reacquire the\nsecurities, and therefore create an obligation for us to pledge additional\namounts, and (3) the counterparty may accelerate the maturity on demand,\nrequiring us to reacquire the security prior to contractual maturity. We\nattempt to mitigate these risks in various ways. Our collateral primarily\nconsists of highly liquid securities. In addition, we underwrite and monitor\nthe financial strength of our counterparties, monitor the fair value of\ncollateral pledged relative to contractually required repurchase amounts, and\nmonitor that our collateral is properly returned through the clearing and\nsettlement process in advance of our cash repayment.

Corporate also\nincludes certain lines of business that management has determined are no\nlonger consistent with the long-term strategic goals of the Company as well\nas results for previously divested businesses. Basis of Presentation FUNDS\nTRANSFER PRICING Corporate treasury manages a funds transfer pricing\nmethodology that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other\nproduct characteristics. Operating segments pay a funding charge for their\nassets and receive a funding credit for their deposits, both of which are\nincluded in net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or\ncredits is recognized in corporate treasury. REVENUE AND EXPENSE SHARING When\nlines of business jointly serve customers, the line of business that is\nresponsible for providing the product or service recognizes revenue or\nexpense with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line\nof business based on established internal revenue-sharing agreements. When a\nline of business uses a service provided by another line of business or\nenterprise function (included in Corporate), expense is generally allocated\nbased on the cost and use of the service provided. We periodically assess and\nupdate our revenue and expense allocation methodologies. TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT\nADJUSTMENTS Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income on\ncertain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while\ntaxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for affordable\nhousing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income,\nin each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit).\nAdjustments are included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and\nInvestment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company\u2019s\nconsolidated financial results.\n

In November 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule to recover losses to the\nFDIC deposit insurance fund as a result of bank failures in the first half of\n2023. Under the rule, the FDIC will collect a special assessment based on an\ninsured depository institution\u2019s estimated amount of uninsured deposits. Upon\nthe FDIC\u2019s finalization of the rule, we expensed an estimated amount of our\nspecial assessment of $ 1.9billion (pre-tax) in fourth quarter 2023.\nSubsequent to the filing of our 2023 Form 10-K, the FDIC provided an update\non losses to the deposit insurance fund, and we expensed an additional $\n284million (pre-tax) in first quarter 2024 for the estimated amount of the\nspecial assessment. We expect the ultimate amount of the special assessment\nmay continue to change as the FDIC determines the actual net losses to the\ndeposit insurance fund.\n                                \n  120    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \n                             \n  Note 19:Employee Benefits  \n                             \nPension and Postretirement Plans We sponsor a frozen noncontributory\nqualified defined benefit retirement plan, the Wells Fargo & Company Cash\nBalance Plan (Cash Balance Plan), which covers eligible employees of Wells\nFargo.

\nRegulatory Capital Requirements The Company and each of its subsidiary banks\nare subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements promulgated by\nfederal banking regulators. The FRB establishes capital requirements for the\nconsolidated financial holding company, and the Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (OCC) has similar requirements for the Company\u2019s national banks,\nincluding Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the Bank). Table 22.1 presents regulatory\ncapital information for the Company and the Bank in accordance with Basel III\ncapital requirements. We must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under\nboth the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Standardized Approach\napplies assigned risk weights to broad risk categories, while the calculation\nof risk-weighted assets (RWAs) under the Advanced Approach differs by\nrequiring applicable banks to utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which\nrelies upon the use of internal credit models, and includes an operational\nrisk component. At March 31, 2024, the Bank and our other insured depository\ninstitutions were considered well-capitalized under the requirements of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act.\nTable 22.1: Regulatory Capital Information\n                                                                             \n                                         \u2026                                   \n                                         \u2026                                   \n                                         &                                   \n                                         \u2026                                   \n                         \u2026               \u2026                                   \n                         \u2026               \u2026                                   \n            \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                           \n            \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                           \n            \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                             \n      $  \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                             \n         \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                             \n         \u2026  %    *    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026       *    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026       *    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                             \n         \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                         \u2026                                   \n                                         \u2026                                   \n                                         &                                   \n                                         \u2026                                   \n                         \u2026               \u2026                                   \n                         \u2026               \u2026                                   \n                         \u2026               \u2026                                   \n                                                                             \n      $               \u2026               \u2026                   \u2026             \u2026    \n                      \u2026  %            \u2026                   \u2026             \u2026    \n                      \u2026               \u2026                   \u2026             \u2026    \n                                                                             \n                      \u2026               \u2026                   \u2026             \u2026    \n                      \u2026               \u2026                   \u2026             \u2026    \n                                                                             \n* Denotes the binding ratio under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches at\nMarch 31, 2024.\n(1) The supplementary leverage ratio consists of Tier 1 capital divided by\ntotal leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure consists of adjusted average\nassets plus certain off-balance sheet exposures. Adjusted average assets\nconsists of total quarterly average assets less goodwill and other permitted\nTier 1 capital deductions (net of deferred tax liabilities).\n(2) The Tier 1 leverage ratio consists of Tier 1 capital divided by total\nquarterly average assets, excluding goodwill and certain other items as\ndetermined under the rule.\nAt March 31, 2024, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 and total capital\nratio requirements for the Company included a global systemically important\nbank (G-SIB) surcharge of 1.50%. The G-SIB surcharge is not applicable to the\nBank. In addition, the CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratio requirements for\nthe Company included a stress capital buffer of 2.90% under the Standardized\nApproach and a capital conservation buffer of 2.50% under the Advanced\nApproach. The capital ratio requirements for the Bank included a capital\nconservation buffer of 2.50% under both the Standardized and Advanced\nApproaches. The Company is required to maintain these risk-based capital\nratios and to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of at least 5.00%\n(composed of a 3.00% minimum requirement plus a supplementary leverage buffer\nof 2.00%) to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments. The Bank is required to maintain an SLR of at least 6.00% to\nbe considered well-capitalized under applicable regulatory capital adequacy\nrules. Capital Planning Requirements The FRB\u2019s capital plan rule establishes\ncapital planning and other requirements that govern capital distributions,\nincluding dividends and share repurchases, by certain large bank holding\ncompanies (BHCs), including Wells Fargo. The FRB conducts an annual\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review exercise and has also published\nguidance regarding its supervisory expectations for capital planning,\nincluding capital policies\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    125  \n                                \nNote 22: Regulatory Capital\nRequirements and Other Restrictions\n(continued)\n\nregarding the process relating to\ncommon stock dividend and repurchase\ndecisions in the FRB\u2019s SR Letter\n15-18. The Parent\u2019s ability to make\ncertain capital distributions is\nsubject to the requirements of the\ncapital plan rule and is also subject\nto the Parent meeting or exceeding\ncertain regulatory capital minimums.\nLoan and Dividend Restrictions\nFederal law restricts the amount and\nthe terms of both credit and non-\ncredit transactions between a bank\nand its nonbank affiliates.\nAdditionally, federal laws and\nregulations limit, and regulators can\nimpose additional limitations on, the\ndividends that a national bank may\npay. Our nonbank subsidiaries are\nalso limited by certain federal and\nstate statutory provisions and\nregulations covering the amount of\ndividends that may be paid in any\ngiven year. In addition, we have\nentered into a Support Agreement\ndated June 28, 2017, as amended and\nrestated on June 26, 2019, among\nWells Fargo & Company, the parent\nholding company (Parent), WFC\nHoldings, LLC, an intermediate\nholding company and subsidiary of the\nParent (IHC), the Bank, Wells Fargo\nSecurities, LLC, Wells Fargo Clearing\nServices, LLC, and certain other\nsubsidiaries of the Parent designated\nfrom time to time as material\nentities for resolution planning\npurposes or identified from time to\ntime as related support entities in\nour resolution plan, pursuant to\nwhich the IHC may be restricted from\nmaking dividend payments to the\nParent if certain liquidity and/or\ncapital metrics fall below defined\ntriggers or if the Parent\u2019s board of\ndirectors authorizes it to file a\ncase under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nFor additional information on loan\nand dividend restrictions, see Note\n26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements\nand Other Restrictions) in
