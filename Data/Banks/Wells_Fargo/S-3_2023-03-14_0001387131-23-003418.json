A prospectus\nsupplement will describe the specific terms of the\ndebt securities offered through that prospectus\nsupplement and any general terms outlined in this\nsection that will not apply to those debt\nsecurities. Unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, our debt\nsecurities will be issued under an indenture dated\nas of February 21, 2017 between us and Citibank,\nN.A., as trustee, referred to in this \u201cDescription\nof Debt Securities of Wells Fargo & Company\u201d\nsection as the \u201c indenture.\u201d We have summarized the\nmaterial terms and provisions of the indenture in\nthis section. We have also filed the indenture as\nan exhibit to the registration statement of which\nthis prospectus is a part. You should read the\nindenture for additional information before you buy\nany debt securities. The summary that follows\nincludes references to section numbers of the\nindenture so that you can more easily locate these\nprovisions. A prospectus supplement to this\nprospectus may relate to a series of medium-term\nnotes, established as a series of debt securities\nunder the indenture. In that event, references\nherein to terms and conditions of debt securities\nbeing provided in the \u201capplicable prospectus\nsupplement\u201d may be provided in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, applicable product\nsupplement, applicable pricing supplement and/or\nother supplement for such debt securities. General\nThe debt securities will be our direct unsecured\nobligations and will rank equally with all of our\nother unsecured unsubordinated debt. The indenture\ndoes not limit the amount of debt securities that\nwe may issue. Holders of the debt securities may be\nfully subordinated to interests held by the U.S.\ngovernment in the event we enter into a\nreceivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar\nproceeding. The debt securities are our unsecured\nsenior debt securities, but our assets consist\nprimarily of equity in our subsidiaries. We are a\nseparate and distinct legal entity from our\nsubsidiaries. As a result, our ability to make\npayments on our debt securities depends on our\nreceipt of dividends, loan payments and other funds\nfrom our subsidiaries. Various federal and state\nstatutes and regulations limit the amount of\ndividends that our banking and other subsidiaries\nmay pay us without regulatory approval. In\naddition, if any of our subsidiaries becomes\ninsolvent, the direct creditors of that subsidiary\nwill have a prior claim on its assets. Our rights\nand the rights of our creditors, including your\nrights as an owner of our debt securities, will be\nsubject to that prior claim, unless we are also a\ndirect creditor of that subsidiary. This\nsubordination of creditors of a parent company to\nprior claims of creditors of its subsidiaries is\ncommonly referred to as structural subordination.\nNew York State law governs the indenture under\nwhich the debt securities will be issued. New York\nhas usury laws that limit the amount of interest\nthat can be charged and paid on loans, which\nincludes debt securities. Under present New York\nusury law, the maximum permissible rate of\ninterest, subject to some exceptions, is 16% per\nannum on a simple interest basis for debt\nsecurities in which less than $250,000 has been\ninvested and 25% per annum on a simple interest\nbasis for debt securities in which $250,000 or more\nhas been invested. This limit may not apply to debt\nsecurities in which $2,500,000 or more has been\ninvested. We agree, to the extent permitted by law,\nnot to voluntarily claim the benefits of any such\nusury laws in connection with the debt securities.\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, we may, from time to time,\nwithout the consent of the holders of a series of\ndebt securities, issue additional debt securities\nof that series having the same terms as previously\nissued debt securities of that series (other than\nthe issue date, the date, if any, that interest\nbegins to accrue and the price to public, which may\nvary). Any such additional debt securities,\ntogether with the initial debt securities, will\nconstitute a single series of debt securities under\nthe indenture. No additional debt securities of a\nseries may be issued if an event of default under\nthe indenture has occurred and is continuing with\nrespect to that series of debt securities. 6 A\nprospectus supplement relating to a series of debt\nsecurities being offered will include specific\nterms relating to the offering. (Section 301) These\nterms will include some or all of the following:\n                                             \n  \u25cf  the                                     \n     title and type of the debt securities;

(Section 101)\nHolders may present debt securities for exchange or\ntransfer, in the manner, at the places and subject\nto the restrictions described in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. If the debt securities are\nheld as global securities, the procedures for\ntransfer will depend upon procedures of the\ndepositary for those global securities. See \u201cBook-\nEntry, Delivery and Form\u201d herein. Holders may\npresent debt securities for payment of principal,\npremium, if any, and interest, if any, register the\ntransfer of the debt securities and exchange the\ndebt securities at the agency in St. Paul,\nMinnesota (or any other place of payment)\nmaintained by us for that purpose. On the date of\nthis prospectus, the paying agent for the debt\nsecurities issued under the indenture is\nComputershare, as agent and attorney-in-fact for\nWells Fargo Bank, acting through its office at CTSO\nMail Operations, 1505 Energy Park Drive, St. Paul,\nMN 55108, Attn: CCT Administrator for Wells Fargo\n(or at such other place or places as may be\ndesignated from time to time). We refer to\nComputershare, as agent and attorney-in-fact for\nWells Fargo Bank, or any successor identified in\nthe applicable 8 prospectus supplement, acting in\nthis capacity for the debt securities, as the \u201c\npaying agent.\u201d Wells Fargo Bank is one of our\naffiliates. Any money that we pay to the paying\nagent for the purpose of making payments on the\ndebt securities and that remains unclaimed two\nyears after the payments were due will, at our\nrequest, be returned to us and after that time any\nholder of a debt security can only look to us for\nthe payments on the debt security. (Section 1003)\nAlthough we anticipate making payments of\nprincipal, premium, if any, and interest, if any,\non most debt securities in U.S. dollars, some debt\nsecurities may be payable in foreign currencies as\nspecified in the applicable prospectus supplement.\nCurrently, few facilities exist in the United\nStates to convert U.S. dollars into foreign\ncurrencies and vice versa. In addition, most U.S.\nbanks do not offer non-U.S. dollar denominated\nchecking or savings account facilities.\nAccordingly, unless alternative arrangements are\nmade, we will pay principal, premium, if any, and\ninterest, if any, on debt securities that are\npayable in a foreign currency to an account at a\nbank outside the United States, which, in the case\nof a debt security payable in euros, will be made\nby credit or transfer to a euro account specified\nby the payee in a country for which the euro is the\nlawful currency. When we refer to the payment of\n\u201cprincipal\u201d in this prospectus in the context of\nthe amount payable at stated maturity or earlier\nredemption or repayment of a debt security whose\npayment is linked to the performance of a market\nmeasure, we are referring to the amount payable on\nsuch debt security at stated maturity or earlier\nredemption or repayment, as specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, other than any\ninterest payable at such time. Such amount may be\ngreater than, equal to or less than the stated\nprincipal or face amount of such debt security at\nissuance. Fixed Rate Debt Securities We may issue\ndebt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate\n(\u201c fixed rate debt securities\u201d). Each fixed rate\ndebt security will bear interest from the date of\nissuance at the annual rate specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement until the\nprincipal is paid or made available for payment.\nFloating Rate Debt Securities We may issue debt\nsecurities that bear interest at a floating rate\ndetermined by reference to a base rate specified in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement (\u201c floating\nrate debt securities\u201d). Redemption and Repayment\nGeneral. Any redemption by us of debt securities\nmay be subject to the prior approval of the Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System or other\nappropriate federal banking agency. Optional\nRedemption By Us. If applicable, the prospectus\nsupplement will indicate the terms of our option to\nredeem the debt securities offered thereby.\nRepayment At Option Of Holder. If applicable, the\nprospectus supplement will indicate that the holder\nhas the option to have us repay the debt securities\noffered thereby on a date or dates specified prior\nto their stated maturity date. Open Market\nPurchases. We may purchase debt securities at any\nprice in the open market or otherwise. Debt\nsecurities so purchased by us may, at our\ndiscretion, be held or resold or surrendered to the\ntrustee for cancellation. Payment of Additional\nAmounts Unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, we will not pay\nany additional amounts on the debt securities\noffered thereby to compensate any beneficial owner\nfor any United States tax withheld from payments on\nsuch debt securities. 9 Conversion and Exchange If\nany offered debt securities are optionally or\nmandatorily convertible or exchangeable into debt,\nequity or other securities of an entity\nunaffiliated with us, or into any other property or\nfor the cash value of any such securities or other\nproperty, the prospectus supplement relating to\nthose debt securities will include the terms and\nconditions governing any conversions and exchanges.\nDenominations Unless we state otherwise in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, the debt\nsecurities will be issued only in registered form,\nwithout coupons, in denominations of $1,000 each\nand integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.\nThe Trustee From time to time, we and certain of\nour subsidiaries maintain deposit accounts and\nconduct other banking transactions, including\nlending transactions, with the trustee in the\nordinary course of business. Notices Unless\notherwise specified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, any notices required to be given to the\nholders of the debt securities in global form will\nbe given to the depositary. Governing Law The\nindenture is, and the debt securities will be,\ngoverned by and will be construed in accordance\nwith New York law. No Listing Unless otherwise\nspecified in the applicable prospectus supplement,\nthe debt securities will not be listed or displayed\non any securities exchange or automated quotation\nsystem.

This\nsection describes the general terms and provisions\nof our debt securities. A prospectus supplement\nwill describe the specific terms of the debt\nsecurities offered through that prospectus\nsupplement and any general terms outlined in this\nsection that will not apply to those debt\nsecurities. Unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, our debt\nsecurities will be issued under an indenture dated\nas of April 25, 2018 among us, as issuer, Wells\nFargo & Company, as Guarantor, and Citibank, N.A.,\nas trustee, referred to in this \u201cDescription of\nDebt Securities of Wells Fargo Finance LLC\u201d section\nas the \u201c indenture.\u201d We have summarized the\nmaterial terms and provisions of the indenture in\nthis section. We have also filed the indenture as\nan exhibit to the registration statement of which\nthis prospectus is a part. You should read the\nindenture for additional information before you buy\nany debt securities. The summary that follows\nincludes references to section numbers of the\nindenture so that you can more easily locate these\nprovisions. A prospectus supplement to this\nprospectus may relate to a series of medium-term\nnotes, established as a series of debt securities\nunder the indenture. In that event, references\nherein to terms and conditions of debt securities\nbeing provided in the \u201capplicable prospectus\nsupplement\u201d may be provided in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, applicable product\nsupplement, applicable pricing supplement and/or\nother supplement for such debt securities. General\nThe debt securities will be our direct unsecured\nobligations and will rank equally with all of our\nother unsecured unsubordinated debt. Payment on the\ndebt securities is fully and unconditionally\nguaranteed by Wells Fargo & Company, as Guarantor.\nThe indenture does not limit the amount of debt\nsecurities that we may issue. The assets of the\nGuarantor consist primarily of equity in its\nsubsidiaries, and the Guarantor is a separate and\ndistinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. As a\nresult, the Guarantor\u2019s ability to address claims\nof holders of our debt securities against the\nGuarantor under the guarantee depends on its\nreceipt of dividends, loan payments and other funds\nfrom its subsidiaries. Various federal and state\nstatutes and regulations limit the amount of\ndividends that banking and other subsidiaries may\npay to the Guarantor without regulatory approval.\nIn addition, if any of the Guarantor\u2019s subsidiaries\nbecomes insolvent, the direct creditors of that\nsubsidiary will have a prior claim on its assets.\nThe rights of the Guarantor and the rights of its\ncreditors will be subject to that prior claim\nunless the Guarantor is also a direct creditor of\nthat subsidiary. This subordination of creditors of\na parent company to prior claims of creditors of\nits subsidiaries is commonly referred to as\nstructural subordination. Holders of our debt\nsecurities are our direct creditors, as well as\ndirect creditors of the Guarantor under the related\nguarantee. As a finance subsidiary, we have no\nindependent operations beyond the issuance and\nadministration of our securities and will have no\nindependent assets available for distributions to\nholders of our debt securities if they make claims\nin respect of the debt securities in a bankruptcy,\nresolution or similar proceeding. Accordingly, any\nrecoveries by such holders will be limited to those\navailable under the related guarantee by the\nGuarantor and that guarantee will rank pari\npassuwith all other unsecured, unsubordinated\nobligations of the Guarantor. Holders of our debt\nsecurities should accordingly assume that in any\nsuch proceedings they would not have any priority\nover and should be treated pari passuwith the\nclaims of other unsecured, unsubordinated creditors\nof the Guarantor, including holders of debt\nsecurities issued by the Guarantor. The indenture\ndoes not contain restrictions on our ability to:\n                                                   \n     incur,                                        \n  \u25cf  assume or become liable for any type of debt  \n     or other obligation;                          \n                                                   \n15\n                                                \n  \u25cf  create                                     \n     liens on our property for any purpose; or  \n                                                \n                                                   \n     pay                                           \n     dividends or make distributions on our        \n  \u25cf  capital stock or repurchase or redeem our     \n     capital                                       \n     stock.                                        \n                                                   \nThe indenture does not require the maintenance of\nany financial ratios or specified levels of net\nworth or liquidity. In addition, the indenture does\nnot contain any provisions which would require us\nto repurchase or redeem or modify the terms of any\nof the debt securities upon a change of control or\nother event involving us which may adversely affect\nthe creditworthiness of the debt securities. New\nYork State law governs the indenture under which\nthe debt securities will be issued. New York has\nusury laws that limit the amount of interest that\ncan be charged and paid on loans, which includes\ndebt securities. Under present New York usury law,\nthe maximum permissible rate of interest, subject\nto some exceptions, is 16% per annum on a simple\ninterest basis for debt securities in which less\nthan $250,000 has been invested and 25% per annum\non a simple interest basis for debt securities in\nwhich $250,000 or more has been invested. This\nlimit may not apply to debt securities in which\n$2,500,000 or more has been invested. We agree, to\nthe extent permitted by law, not to voluntarily\nclaim the benefits of any such usury laws in\nconnection with the debt securities. Unless\notherwise specified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, we may, from time to time, without the\nconsent of the holders of a series of debt\nsecurities, issue additional debt securities of\nthat series having the same terms as previously\nissued debt securities of that series (other than\nthe issue date, the date, if any, that interest\nbegins to accrue and the price to public, which may\nvary). Any such additional debt securities,\ntogether with the initial debt securities, will\nconstitute a single series of debt securities under\nthe indenture. No additional debt securities of a\nseries may be issued if an event of default under\nthe indenture has occurred and is continuing with\nrespect to that series of debt securities. A\nprospectus supplement relating to a series of debt\nsecurities being offered will include specific\nterms relating to the offering. (Section 301) These\nterms will include some or all of the following:\n                                             \n  \u25cf  the                                     \n     title and type of the debt securities;

If the debt securities are\nheld as global securities, the procedures for\ntransfer will depend upon procedures of the\ndepositary for those global securities. See \u201cBook-\nEntry, Delivery and Form\u201d herein. Holders may\npresent debt securities for payment of principal,\npremium, if any, and interest, if any, register the\ntransfer of the debt securities and exchange the\ndebt securities at the agency in St. Paul,\nMinnesota (or any other place of payment)\nmaintained by us for that purpose. On the date of\nthis prospectus, the paying agent for the debt\nsecurities issued under the indenture is\nComputershare, as agent and attorney-in-fact for\nWells Fargo Bank, 17 acting through its office at\nCTSO Mail Operations, 1505 Energy Park Drive, St.\nPaul, MN 55108, Attn: CCT Administrator for Wells\nFargo (or at such other place or places as may be\ndesignated from time to time). We refer to\nComputershare, as agent and attorney-in-fact for\nWells Fargo Bank, or any successor identified in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement, acting in\nthis capacity for the debt securities, as the \u201c\npaying agent.\u201d Wells Fargo Bank is one of our\naffiliates. Any money that we pay to the paying\nagent for the purpose of making payments on the\ndebt securities and that remains unclaimed two\nyears after the payments were due will, at our\nrequest, be returned to us and after that time any\nholder of a debt security can only look to us for\nthe payments on the debt security. (Section 1003)\nAlthough we anticipate making payments of\nprincipal, premium, if any, and interest, if any,\non most debt securities in U.S. dollars, some debt\nsecurities may be payable in foreign currencies as\nspecified in the applicable prospectus supplement.\nCurrently, few facilities exist in the United\nStates to convert U.S. dollars into foreign\ncurrencies and vice versa. In addition, most U.S.\nbanks do not offer non-U.S. dollar denominated\nchecking or savings account facilities.\nAccordingly, unless alternative arrangements are\nmade, we will pay principal, premium, if any, and\ninterest, if any, on debt securities that are\npayable in a foreign currency to an account at a\nbank outside the United States, which, in the case\nof a debt security payable in euros, will be made\nby credit or transfer to a euro account specified\nby the payee in a country for which the euro is the\nlawful currency. When we refer to the payment of\n\u201cprincipal\u201d in this prospectus in the context of\nthe amount payable at stated maturity or earlier\nredemption or repayment of a debt security whose\npayment is linked to the performance of a market\nmeasure, we are referring to the amount payable on\nsuch debt security at stated maturity or earlier\nredemption or repayment, as specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, other than any\ninterest payable at such time. Such amount may be\ngreater than, equal to or less than the stated\nprincipal or face amount of such debt security at\nissuance. Fixed Rate Debt Securities We may issue\nfixed rate debt securities. Each fixed rate debt\nsecurity will bear interest from the date of\nissuance at the annual rate specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement until the\nprincipal is paid or made available for payment.\nFloating Rate Debt Securities We may issue floating\nrate debt securities that bear interest at a\nfloating rate determined by reference to a base\nrate specified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. Redemption and Repayment Optional\nRedemption By Us. If applicable, the prospectus\nsupplement will indicate the terms of our option to\nredeem the debt securities offered thereby.\nRepayment At Option Of Holder. If applicable, the\nprospectus supplement will indicate that the holder\nhas the option to have us repay the debt securities\noffered thereby on a date or dates specified prior\nto their stated maturity date. Open Market\nPurchases. We may purchase debt securities at any\nprice in the open market or otherwise. Debt\nsecurities so purchased by us may, at our\ndiscretion, be held or resold or surrendered to the\ntrustee for cancellation. Payment of Additional\nAmounts Unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, we will not pay\nany additional amounts on the debt securities\noffered thereby to compensate any beneficial owner\nfor any United States tax withheld from payments on\nsuch debt securities. 18 Denominations Unless we\nstate otherwise in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, the debt securities will be issued only\nin registered form, without coupons, in\ndenominations of $1,000 each or integral multiples\nof $1,000 in excess thereof. The Trustee From time\nto time, we and certain of our affiliates maintain\ndeposit accounts and conduct other banking\ntransactions, including lending transactions, with\nthe trustee in the ordinary course of business.\nNotices Unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, any notices\nrequired to be given to the holders of the debt\nsecurities in global form will be given to the\ndepositary. Governing Law The indenture is, and the\ndebt securities will be, governed by and will be\nconstrued in accordance with New York law. No\nListing Unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, the debt\nsecurities will not be listed or displayed on any\nsecurities exchange or automated quotation system.\nWells Fargo & Company Guarantee The Guarantor will\nfully and unconditionally guarantee, on an\nunsecured basis, the full and punctual payment of\nthe principal of, interest on, and all other\namounts payable under the debt securities when the\nsame becomes due and payable, whether at maturity\nor upon redemption, repayment at the option of the\nholders of the applicable debt securities, upon\nacceleration or otherwise. If for any reason we do\nnot make any required payment in respect of our\ndebt securities when due, the Guarantor will on\ndemand pay the unpaid amount at the same place and\nin the same manner that applies to payments made by\nus under the indenture. The guarantee is of payment\nand not of collection. (Section 1601) The\nGuarantor\u2019s obligations under the guarantee are\nunconditional and absolute. However,\n                                                   \n       the                                         \n       Guarantor will not be liable for any        \n  (1)  amount of payment that we are excused from  \n       making                                      \n       or any amount in excess of the amount       \n       actually due and owing by us, and           \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       any                                         \n       defenses or counterclaims available to us   \n       (except those resulting solely from, or on  \n       account of, our insolvency or our status    \n       as debtor or subject of a bankruptcy or     \n  (2)  insolvency                                  \n       proceeding) will also be available to the   \n       Guarantor to the same extent as these       \n       defenses                                    \n       or counterclaims are available to us,       \n       whether or not asserted by us. (Section     \n       1602)                                       \n                                                   \nHolders of our debt securities are our direct\ncreditors, as well as direct creditors of the\nGuarantor under the related guarantee. As a finance\nsubsidiary, we have no independent operations\nbeyond the issuance and administration of our\nsecurities and will have no independent assets\navailable for distributions to holders of our debt\nsecurities if they make claims in respect of the\ndebt securities in a bankruptcy, resolution or\nsimilar proceeding. Accordingly, any recoveries by\nsuch holders will be limited to those available\nunder the related guarantee by the Guarantor and\nthat guarantee will rank pari passuwith all other\nunsecured, unsubordinated obligations of the\nGuarantor. Holders of our debt securities should\naccordingly assume that in any such proceedings\nthey would not have any priority over and should be\ntreated pari passuwith the claims of other\nunsecured, unsubordinated creditors of the\nGuarantor, including holders of debt securities\nissued by the Guarantor. 19 Consolidation, Merger\nor Sale The indenture generally permits a\nconsolidation or merger between us and another\nentity and/or between the Guarantor and another\nentity. It also permits the conveyance, transfer or\nlease by us of all or substantially all of our\nproperty and assets and/or by the Guarantor of all\nor substantially all of its property and assets.\nWith respect to us, these transactions, if a\ntransaction other than a conveyance, transfer or\nlease to one or more of the Guarantor\u2019s\nsubsidiaries, are permitted if:\n                                                   \n     the                                           \n     resulting or acquiring entity, if other than  \n     us, is organized and existing under the       \n     laws of a domestic jurisdiction and assumes   \n  \u25cf  all of our responsibilities and liabilities   \n     under the indenture, including the payment    \n     of all amounts due on the debt securities     \n     and performance of the covenants in the       \n     indenture; and                                \n                                                   \n                                                   \n     immediately                                   \n     after the transaction, and giving effect to   \n  \u25cf  the transaction, no covenant breach (as       \n     defined                                       \n     below) or event of default under the          \n     indenture exists.

As a result, such\nsuccessor entity may exercise our rights and powers\nunder the indenture, in our name and, except in the\ncase of a lease of all or substantially all of our\nproperties, we will be released from all our\nliabilities and obligations under the indenture and\nunder the debt securities. (Section 803) The\nsuccessor entity to a consolidation or merger may\nbe the Guarantor or a subsidiary of the Guarantor.\nIn addition, the successor entity in a conveyance,\ntransfer or lease may be the Guarantor.

(Section 501)       \n                                                   \nIf an event of default for any series of debt\nsecurities occurs and continues, the trustee or the\nholders of at least 25% in aggregate principal\namount of the outstanding debt securities of the\nseries may declare the entire principal of all the\ndebt securities of that series to be due and\npayable immediately. If such a declaration occurs,\nthe holders of a majority of the aggregate\nprincipal amount of the outstanding debt securities\nof that series can, subject to conditions, rescind\nthe declaration. Unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement for a particular\noffering of debt securities, the holders of our\ndebt securities will not have the right to\naccelerate the payment of principal of the debt\nsecurities as a result of a covenant breach or our\nfailure to perform any covenant or agreement\ncontained in the debt securities or the indenture\nother than the obligations to pay principal and\ninterest on the debt securities. (Sections 502,\n513) 22 Events of bankruptcy, insolvency,\nreceivership or liquidation relating to the\nGuarantor will not constitute an event of default\nwith respect to any series of our debt securities.\nIn addition, failure by the Guarantor to perform\nany of its covenants or warranties (other than a\npayment default) will not constitute an event of\ndefault with respect to any series of our debt\nsecurities. Therefore, events of bankruptcy,\ninsolvency, receivership or liquidation relating to\nthe Guarantor (in the absence of any such event\noccurring with respect to us) will not permit any\nof the debt securities to be declared due and\npayable and the trustee is not authorized to\nexercise any remedy against us or the Guarantor\nupon the occurrence or continuation of these events\nwith respect to the Guarantor. Instead, even if an\nevent of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or\nliquidation relating to the Guarantor has occurred,\nthe trustee and the holders of debt securities of a\nseries will not be able to declare the relevant\ndebt securities to be immediately due and payable\nunless there is an event of default with respect to\nthat series as described above, such as our\nbankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or liquidation\nor a payment default by us or the Guarantor on the\nrelevant debt securities. The value you receive on\nany series of debt securities may be significantly\nless than what you would have otherwise received\nhad our debt securities been declared due and\npayable immediately or the trustee been authorized\nto exercise any remedy against us or the Guarantor\nupon the occurrence or continuation of these events\nwith respect to the Guarantor. Unless otherwise\nspecified in the applicable prospectus supplement,\na \u201c covenant breach,\u201d when used in the indenture\nwith respect to any series of debt securities,\nmeans any of the following:\n                                                   \n       failure                                     \n       to perform any covenant in the indenture    \n       that applies to debt securities of that     \n       series                                      \n  (1)  for 90 days after Wells Fargo Finance LLC   \n       and the Guarantor have received written     \n       notice                                      \n       of the failure to perform in the manner     \n       specified in the indenture; or              \n                                                   \n                                                   \n       any                                         \n       other covenant breach that may be           \n  (2)  specified for the debt securities of that   \n       series when                                 \n       that series is created.

The indenture\nrequires each of us and the Guarantor to file an\nofficers\u2019 certificate with the trustee each year\nthat states, to the knowledge of a certifying\nofficer, whether or not any defaults exist under\nthe terms of the indenture. (Section 1005). The\ntrustee may withhold notice to the holders of debt\nsecurities of any default, except defaults in the\npayment of principal, premium, interest or any\nsinking fund installment, if it considers the\nwithholding of notice to be in the best interests\nof the holders. For purposes of this paragraph, \u201c\ndefault\u201d means any event which is, or after notice\nor lapse of time or both would become, a covenant\nbreach with respect to the debt securities of a\nseries or an event of default under the indenture\nwith respect to the debt securities of the\napplicable series. (Section 602) Other than its\nduties in the case of a covenant breach or an event\nof default, the trustee is not obligated to\nexercise any of its rights or powers under the\nindenture at the request, order or direction of any\nholders, unless the holders offer the trustee\nindemnification. (Sections 601, 603) If\nindemnification is provided, then, subject to other\nrights of the trustee, the holders of a majority in\nprincipal amount of the outstanding debt securities\nof any series may, with respect to the debt\nsecurities of that series, direct the time, method\nand place of:\n                                                   \n     conducting                                    \n  \u25cf  any proceeding for any remedy available to    \n     the trustee; or                               \n                                                   \n                                                   \n     exercising                                    \n  \u25cf  any trust or power conferred upon the         \n     trustee.

We or Wells Fargo Finance LLC, as\napplicable, will make principal and interest\npayments on all debt securities represented by a\nglobal security to the paying agent which in turn\nwill make payment to DTC or its nominee, as the\ncase may be, as the sole registered owner and the\nsole holder of the debt securities represented by a\nglobal security for all purposes under the\nindenture. Accordingly, we, Wells Fargo Finance\nLLC, the applicable trustee and any paying agent\nwill have no responsibility or liability for:\n                                                   \n     any                                           \n     aspect of DTC\u2019s records relating to, or       \n  \u25cf  payments made on account of, beneficial       \n     ownership interests in a debt security        \n     represented by a global security;             \n                                                   \n25\n                                                   \n     any                                           \n     other aspect of the relationship between DTC  \n  \u25cf  and its participants or the relationship      \n     between those participants and the owners of  \n     beneficial interests in a global security     \n     held through those participants; or           \n                                                   \n                                                   \n     the                                           \n  \u25cf  maintenance, supervision or review of any of  \n     DTC\u2019s records relating to those beneficial    \n     ownership interests.                          \n                                                   \nDTC\u2019s current practice is to credit participants\u2019\naccounts on each payment date with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in the principal amount of\nsuch global security as shown on DTC\u2019s records,\nupon DTC\u2019s receipt of funds and corresponding\ndetail information. The agents for the debt\nsecurities represented by a global security will\ninitially designate the accounts to be credited.\nPayments by participants to owners of beneficial\ninterests in a global security will be governed by\nstanding instructions and customary practices, as\nis the case with securities held for customer\naccounts registered in \u201cstreet name,\u201d and will be\nthe sole responsibility of those participants.\nBook-entry debt securities may be more difficult to\npledge because of the lack of a physical debt\nsecurity. DTC So long as DTC or its nominee is the\nregistered owner of a global security, DTC or its\nnominee, as the case may be, will be considered the\nsole owner and holder of the debt securities\nrepresented by that global security for all\npurposes of the debt securities. Owners of\nbeneficial interests in the debt securities will\nnot be entitled to have debt securities registered\nin their names, will not receive or be entitled to\nreceive physical delivery of the debt securities in\ndefinitive form and will not be considered owners\nor holders of debt securities under the indenture.\nAccordingly, each person owning a beneficial\ninterest in a global security must rely on the\nprocedures of DTC and, if that person is not a DTC\nparticipant, on the procedures of the participant\nthrough which that person owns its interest, to\nexercise any rights of a holder of debt securities.\nThe laws of some jurisdictions require that certain\npurchasers of securities take physical delivery of\nthe securities in certificated form. These laws may\nimpair the ability to transfer beneficial interests\nin a global security. Beneficial owners may\nexperience delays in receiving distributions on\ntheir debt securities since distributions will\ninitially be made to DTC and must then be\ntransferred through the chain of intermediaries to\nthe beneficial owner\u2019s account. We and Wells Fargo\nFinance LLC understand that, under existing\nindustry practices, if we or Wells Fargo Finance\nLLC, as applicable, request holders to take any\naction, or if an owner of a beneficial interest in\na global security desires to take any action which\na holder is entitled to take under the indenture,\nthen DTC would authorize the participants holding\nthe relevant beneficial interests to take that\naction and those participants would authorize the\nbeneficial owners owning through such participants\nto take that action or would otherwise act upon the\ninstructions of beneficial owners owning through\nthem. Beneficial interests in a global security\nwill be shown on, and transfers of those ownership\ninterests will be effected only through, records\nmaintained by DTC and its participants for that\nglobal security. The conveyance of notices and\nother communications by DTC to its participants and\nby its participants to owners of beneficial\ninterests in the debt securities will be governed\nby arrangements among them, subject to any\nstatutory or regulatory requirements in effect. DTC\nis a limited-purpose trust company organized under\nthe New York banking law, a \u201cbanking organization\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a\nmember of the Federal Reserve System, a \u201cclearing\ncorporation\u201d within the meaning of the New York\nUniform Commercial Code and a \u201cclearing agency\u201d\nregistered under the Exchange Act. DTC holds the\nsecurities of its participants and facilitates the\nclearance and settlement of securities transactions\namong its participants in such securities through\nelectronic book-entry changes in accounts of its\nparticipants. The electronic book-entry system\neliminates the need for physical certificates.\nDTC\u2019s participants include securities brokers and\ndealers, including underwriters, banks, trust\ncompanies, clearing corporations and certain other\norganizations, some of which, and/or their\nrepresentatives, own DTC. Banks, brokers, dealers,\ntrust companies and others that clear through or\nmaintain a custodial relationship with a\nparticipant, either directly or 26 indirectly, also\nhave access to DTC\u2019s book-entry system. The rules\napplicable to DTC and its participants are on file\nwith the SEC. DTC has indicated that the above\ninformation with respect to DTC has been provided\nto its participants and other members of the\nfinancial community for informational purposes only\nand is not intended to serve as a representation,\nwarranty or contract modification of any kind.\nClearstream Clearstream is incorporated under the\nlaws of Luxembourg as a professional depositary.\nClearstream holds securities for its participating\norganizations, or \u201c Clearstream Participants,\u201d and\nfacilitates the clearance and settlement of\nsecurities transactions between Clearstream\nParticipants through electronic book-entry changes\nin accounts of Clearstream Participants, thereby\neliminating the need for physical movement of\ncertificates. Clearstream provides to Clearstream\nParticipants, among other things, services for\nsafekeeping, administration, clearance and\nsettlement of internationally traded securities and\nsecurities lending and borrowing. Clearstream\ninterfaces with domestic securities markets in\nseveral countries. As a professional depositary,\nClearstream is subject to regulation by the\nLuxembourg Commission for the Supervision of the\nFinancial Sector (Commission de Surveillance du\nSecteur Financier). Clearstream Participants are\nrecognized financial institutions around the world,\nincluding underwriters, securities brokers and\ndealers, banks, trust companies, clearing\ncorporations and certain other organizations.\nClearstream\u2019s U.S. Participants are limited to\nsecurities brokers and dealers and banks. Indirect\naccess to Clearstream is also available to others,\nsuch as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies\nthat clear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a Clearstream Participant either\ndirectly or indirectly. Distributions with respect\nto debt securities held beneficially through\nClearstream will be credited to cash accounts of\nClearstream Participants in accordance with its\nrules and procedures, to the extent received by the\nU.S. Depositary for Clearstream. Euroclear\nEuroclear was created in 1968 to hold securities\nfor participants of Euroclear, or \u201c Euroclear\nParticipants,\u201d and to clear and settle transactions\nbetween Euroclear Participants through simultaneous\nelectronic book-entry delivery against payment,\nthereby eliminating the need for physical movement\nof certificates and any risk from lack of\nsimultaneous transfers of securities and cash.\nEuroclear performs various other services,\nincluding securities lending and borrowing and\ninteracts with domestic markets in several\ncountries. Euroclear is operated by Euroclear Bank\nS.A./N.V., or the \u201c Euroclear Operator,\u201d under\ncontract with Euroclear plc, a U.K. corporation.\nAll operations are conducted by the Euroclear\nOperator, and all Euroclear securities clearance\naccounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts\nwith the Euroclear Operator, not Euroclear plc.\nEuroclear plc establishes policy for Euroclear on\nbehalf of Euroclear Participants. Euroclear\nParticipants include banks, including central\nbanks, securities brokers and dealers and other\nprofessional financial intermediaries. Indirect\naccess to Euroclear is also available to other\nfirms that clear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a Euroclear Participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly. The Euroclear Operator is a\nBelgian bank. As such it is regulated by the\nBelgian Banking and Finance Commission. Securities\nclearance accounts and cash accounts with the\nEuroclear Operator are governed by the Terms and\nConditions Governing Use of Euroclear and the\nrelated Operating Procedures of the Euroclear\nSystem, and applicable Belgian law, referred to\nherein as the \u201c Terms and Conditions.\u201d The Terms\nand Conditions govern transfers of securities and\ncash within Euroclear, withdrawals of securities\nand cash from Euroclear, and receipts of payments\nwith respect to securities in Euroclear. All\nsecurities in Euroclear are held on a fungible\nbasis without attribution of specific certificates\nto specific securities clearance accounts. The\nEuroclear Operator acts under the Terms and\nConditions only on behalf of Euroclear\nParticipants, and has no record of or relationship\nwith persons holding through Euroclear\nParticipants. 27 Distributions with respect to debt\nsecurities held beneficially through Euroclear will\nbe credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear\nParticipants in accordance with the Terms and\nConditions, to the extent received by the U.S.\nDepositary for Euroclear. Investors that acquire,\nhold and transfer interests in the debt securities\nby book-entry through accounts with the Euroclear\nOperator or any other securities intermediary are\nsubject to the laws and contractual provisions\ngoverning their relationship with such\nintermediary, as well as the laws and contractual\nprovisions governing the relationship between such\nan intermediary and each other intermediary, if\nany, standing between themselves and the global\nsecurities. Global Clearance and Settlement\nProcedures Unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, initial\nsettlement for the debt securities will be made in\nimmediately available funds. Secondary market\ntrading between DTC participants will occur in the\nordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will\nbe settled in immediately available funds using\nDTC\u2019s Same-Day Funds Settlement System. Secondary\nmarket trading between Clearstream Participants\nand/or Euroclear Participants will occur in the\nordinary way in accordance with the applicable\nrules and operating procedures of Clearstream and\nEuroclear and will be settled using the procedures\napplicable to conventional eurobonds in immediately\navailable funds. Cross-market transfers between\npersons holding directly or indirectly through DTC,\non the one hand, and directly or indirectly through\nClearstream Participants or Euroclear Participants,\non the other, will be effected through DTC in\naccordance with DTC rules on behalf of the relevant\nEuropean international clearing system by its U.S.\nDepositary; however, such cross-market transactions\nwill require delivery of instructions to the\nrelevant European international clearing system by\nthe counterparty in such system in accordance with\nits rules and procedures and within its established\ndeadlines (European time). The relevant European\ninternational clearing system will, if the\ntransaction meets its settlement requirements,\ndeliver instructions to its U.S. Depositary to take\naction to effect final settlement on its behalf by\ndelivering or receiving debt securities through\nDTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance\nwith normal procedures for same-day funds\nsettlement applicable to DTC. Clearstream\nParticipants and Euroclear Participants may not\ndeliver instructions directly to their respective\nU.S. Depositaries. Because of time-zone\ndifferences, credits of debt securities received\nthrough Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of a\ntransaction with a DTC participant will be made\nduring subsequent securities settlement processing\nand dated the business day following the DTC\nsettlement date. Such credits or any transactions\nin such debt securities settled during such\nprocessing will be reported to the relevant\nEuroclear Participants or Clearstream Participants\non such business day. Cash received in Clearstream\nor Euroclear as a result of sales of debt\nsecurities by or through a Clearstream Participant\nor a Euroclear Participant to a DTC participant\nwill be received with value on the DTC settlement\ndate but will be available in the relevant\nClearstream or Euroclear cash account only as of\nthe business day following settlement in DTC.\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, a \u201c business day\u201d means any\nday, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is\nneither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking\ninstitutions are authorized or required by law or\nregulation to close in New York, New York. If the\ndebt securities are cleared only through Euroclear\nand Clearstream (and not DTC), you will be able to\nmake and receive through Euroclear and Clearstream\npayments, deliveries, transfers, exchanges,\nnotices, and other transactions involving any\nsecurities held through those systems only on days\nwhen those systems are open for business. Those\nsystems may not be open for business on days when\nbanks, brokers, and other institutions are open for\nbusiness in the United States. In addition, because\nof time-zone differences, U.S. investors who hold\ntheir interests in the securities through these\nsystems and wish to transfer their interests, or to\nreceive or make a payment or delivery or exercise\nany other right with respect to their interests, on\na particular day may find that the transaction will\nnot be effected until the next business day in\nLuxembourg or Brussels, as applicable. Thus, U.S.\ninvestors who wish to exercise rights that expire\non a particular day may need to act before the\nexpiration date. Although DTC, Clearstream and\nEuroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures\nin order to facilitate transfers of debt securities\namong participants of DTC, Clearstream and\nEuroclear, they are under no obligation to perform\nor continue to perform such procedures and such\nprocedures may be modified or discontinued at any\ntime. 28 None of Wells Fargo & Company, Wells Fargo\nFinance LLC nor any paying agent will have any\nresponsibility for the performance by DTC,\nEuroclear or Clearstream or their respective direct\nor indirect participants of their obligations under\nthe rules and procedures governing their\noperations.\n                        29                         \nDESCRIPTION OF WARRANTS OF WELLS FARGO & COMPANY In\nthis \u201cDescription of Warrants of Wells Fargo &\nCompany\u201d section, all references to \u201cwarrants\u201d\nrefer only to warrants issued by Wells Fargo &\nCompany and not to any warrants issued by any\nsubsidiary or affiliate.

Any\nwarrants that we issue will contain, to the extent\nrequired, contractual provisions required to comply\nwith the \u201cRestrictions on Qualified Financial\nContracts of Systemically Important U.S. Banking\nOrganizations and the U.S. Operations of\nSystemically Important Foreign Banking\nOrganizations; Revisions to the Definition of\nQualifying Master Netting Agreement and Related\nDefinitions\u201d as issued by the Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System (the \u201c FRB\u201d), the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the \u201c FDIC\u201d)\nand the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n(the \u201c OCC\u201d) and other applicable law.

If we issue warrants as part of a unit,\nthe applicable prospectus supplement will specify\nwhether those warrants may be separated from the\nother securities or property in the unit prior to\nthe warrants\u2019 expiration date. We may issue\nwarrants to purchase or sell, on terms to be\ndetermined at the time of sale:\n                                                   \n     securities                                    \n     issued by us or by an entity affiliated or    \n  \u25cf  not affiliated with us, a basket of those     \n     securities or an index or indices of those    \n     securities;                                   \n                                                   \n                  \n  \u25cf  currencies;  \n                  \n                         \n  \u25cf  any                 \n     other property; or  \n                         \n                                \n  \u25cf  any                        \n     combination of the above.  \n                                \nThe property in the above clauses is referred to in\nthis \u201cDescription of Warrants of Wells Fargo &\nCompany\u201d section as \u201c warrant property.\u201d We may\nsatisfy our obligations, if any, with respect to\nany warrants by delivering the warrant property or\nthe cash value of the warrant property, as\ndescribed in the applicable prospectus supplement.\nAlthough we anticipate making payments on most\nwarrants in U.S. dollars, payments on some warrants\nmay be in a foreign currency as specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. Currently, few\nfacilities exist in the United States to convert\nU.S. dollars into foreign currencies and vice\nversa. In addition, most United States banks do not\noffer non-U.S. dollar denominated checking or\nsavings account facilities. Accordingly, unless\nalternative arrangements are made, we will make\npayments on warrants that are payable in a foreign\ncurrency to an account at a bank outside the United\nStates, which, in the case of a payment to be made\nin euros, will be made by credit or transfer to a\neuro account specified by the payee in a country\nfor which the euro is the lawful currency.

It will also permit\nthe conveyance, transfer or lease by us of all or\nsubstantially all of our property and assets.

If we consolidate or merge with or into\nany other entity or convey, transfer or lease all\nor substantially all of our assets in accordance\nwith the requirements of the warrant agreement, the\nresulting or acquiring entity will be substituted\nfor us in the warrant agreement with the same\neffect as if it had been an original party to the\nwarrant agreement. As a result, such successor\nentity may exercise our rights and powers under the\nwarrant agreement, in our name and, except in the\ncase of a lease of all or substantially all of our\nproperties, we will be released from all our\nliabilities and obligations under the warrant\nagreement and under the warrants. The warrant\nagreement permits us to convey, transfer or lease\nall or substantially all of our assets to one or\nmore of our subsidiaries without any restriction\nand, in that event, those subsidiaries would not be\nrequired under the warrant agreement to assume our\nliabilities and obligations under the warrant\nagreement and the warrants. Enforceability of\nRights of Warrantholders.The warrant agent will act\nsolely as our agent in connection with the warrants\nand will not assume any obligation or relationship\nof agency or trust for or with any holders of\nwarrant certificates or beneficial owners of\nwarrants. Any holder of warrant certificates may,\nwithout the consent of any other person, enforce by\nappropriate legal action, on its own behalf, its\nright to exercise the warrants evidenced by the\nwarrant certificates, in the manner provided in\nthose warrants or pursuant to the applicable\nwarrant agreement. No holder of any warrant\ncertificate or beneficial owner of any warrants\nwill be entitled to any of the 32 rights of a\nholder of the debt securities or any other warrant\nproperty purchasable upon exercise of the warrants,\nincluding the right to receive the payments on\nthose debt securities or other warrant property or\nto enforce any of the covenants or rights in the\nindenture or any other similar agreement.\nRegistration and Transfer of Warrants.Subject to\nthe terms of the warrant agreement, warrants in\nregistered definitive form may be presented for\nexchange and for registration of transfer, with the\nform of transfer endorsed thereon duly executed at\nthe corporate trust office of the warrant agent for\nthose warrants, or at any other office indicated in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement relating to\nthose warrants, without service charge. However,\nthe holder will be required to pay any taxes and\nother governmental charges as described in the\nwarrant agreement. The transfer or exchange will be\neffected only if the warrant agent for the warrants\nis satisfied with the documents of title and\nidentity of the person making the request.\nTitle.We, the unit agent, the trustee, the warrant\nagent and any of our or their agents will treat the\nregistered holder of any warrant as the owner,\nnotwithstanding any notice to the contrary, for all\npurposes. New York Law to Govern.The warrants and\nthe warrant agreement will be governed by, and\nconstrued in accordance with, the laws of the State\nof New York.

If we issue warrants as part\nof a unit, the applicable prospectus supplement\nwill specify whether those warrants may be\nseparated from the other securities or property in\nthe unit prior to the warrants\u2019 expiration date.\nThe Guarantor will fully and unconditionally\nguarantee the full and punctual payment of amounts\npayable under the warrants when the same becomes\ndue and payable, whether at expiration, upon\nexercise, redemption or repurchase at the option of\nthe holders of the applicable warrants.

Although we anticipate\nmaking payments on most warrants in U.S. dollars,\npayments on some warrants may be in a foreign\ncurrency as specified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. Currently, few facilities exist in the\nUnited States to convert U.S. dollars into foreign\ncurrencies and vice versa. In addition, most United\nStates banks do not offer non-U.S. dollar\ndenominated checking or savings account facilities.\nAccordingly, unless alternative arrangements are\nmade, we will make payments on warrants that are\npayable in a foreign currency to an account at a\nbank outside the United States, which, in the case\nof a payment to be made in euros, will be made by\ncredit or transfer to a euro account specified by\nthe payee in a country for which the euro is the\nlawful currency. 34 Further Information in\nProspectus Supplement The terms and conditions set\nforth in this \u201cDescription of Warrants of Wells\nFargo Finance LLC\u201d will apply to each warrant\nunless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement and in that warrant.

It will also permit\nthe conveyance, transfer or lease by us of all or\nsubstantially all of our property and assets and/or\nby the Guarantor of all or substantially all of its\nproperty and assets. With respect to us, these\ntransactions, if a transaction other than a\nconveyance, transfer or lease to one or more of the\nGuarantor\u2019s subsidiaries, are permitted if the\nresulting or acquiring entity, if other than us, is\norganized and existing under the laws of a domestic\njurisdiction and assumes all of our\nresponsibilities and liabilities under the warrant\nagreement.

If the Guarantor consolidates or\nmerges with or into any other entity or conveys,\ntransfers or leases all or substantially all of its\nassets in accordance with the requirements of the\nwarrant agreement, the resulting or acquiring\nentity will be substituted for the Guarantor in the\nwarrant agreement with the same effect as if it had\nbeen an original party to the warrant agreement.

Significant Provisions of the\nUnit Agreement and the Unit Agreement Without\nHolders\u2019 Obligations The unit agreement and the\nunit agreement without holders\u2019 obligations each\ncontains the provisions described below.\nConsolidation, Merger or Sale.The unit agreement\nand the unit agreement without holders\u2019 obligations\nwill generally permit a consolidation or merger\nbetween us and another entity. They will also\npermit the conveyance, transfer or lease by us of\nall or substantially all of our property and\nassets. These transactions, if a transaction other\nthan a conveyance, transfer or lease to one or more\nof our subsidiaries, are permitted if:\n                                                   \n     the                                           \n     resulting or acquiring entity, if other than  \n     us, is organized and existing under the       \n  \u25cf  laws of a domestic jurisdiction and assumes   \n     all of our responsibilities and liabilities   \n     under the unit agreement or the unit          \n     agreement without holders\u2019 obligations, as    \n     applicable; and                               \n                                                   \n                                                   \n     immediately                                   \n     after the transaction, and giving effect to   \n     the transaction, we or the resulting or       \n     acquiring                                     \n  \u25cf  entity, if other than us, are not in default  \n     in the performance of the covenants of the    \n     unit agreement or the unit agreement without  \n     holders\u2019 obligations, as applicable,          \n     that are applicable to us.                    \n                                                   \nIf we consolidate or merge with or into any other\nentity or convey, transfer or lease all or\nsubstantially all of our assets in accordance with\nthe requirements of the unit agreement or the unit\nagreement without holders\u2019 obligations, as\napplicable, the resulting or acquiring entity will\nbe substituted for us in the unit agreement or the\nunit agreement without holders\u2019 obligations, as\napplicable, with the same effect as if it had been\nan original party to the 42 unit agreement or the\nunit agreement without holders\u2019 obligations, as\napplicable. As a result, such successor entity may\nexercise our rights and powers under the unit\nagreement or the unit agreement without holders\u2019\nobligations, as applicable, in our name and, except\nin the case of a lease of all or substantially all\nof our properties, we will be released from all our\nliabilities and obligations under the unit\nagreement and the unit agreement without holders\u2019\nobligations and under the units. The unit agreement\nand the unit agreement without holders\u2019 obligations\npermit us to convey, transfer or lease all or\nsubstantially all of our assets to one or more of\nour subsidiaries without any restriction and, in\nthat event, those subsidiaries would not be\nrequired under the unit agreement or the unit\nagreement without holders\u2019 obligations to assume\nour liabilities and obligations under the unit\nagreement or the unit agreement without holders\u2019\nobligations and the units. No Trust Indenture Act\nQualification.The unit agreement and the unit\nagreement without holders\u2019 obligations will not be\nqualified as indentures under, and the unit agent\nwill not be required to qualify as a trustee under,\nthe Trust Indenture Act. Accordingly, the holders\nof units and purchase contracts will not have the\nbenefits of the protections of the Trust Indenture\nAct. Replacement of Unit Certificates.We will\nreplace any mutilated certificate evidencing a\ndefinitive unit or purchase contract at the expense\nof the holder upon surrender of that certificate to\nthe unit agent. We will replace certificates that\nhave been destroyed, lost or stolen at the expense\nof the holder upon delivery to us and the unit\nagent of evidence satisfactory to us and the unit\nagent of the destruction, loss or theft of the\ncertificates. In the case of a destroyed, lost or\nstolen certificate, an indemnity satisfactory to\nthe unit agent and to us may be required at the\nexpense of the holder of the units or purchase\ncontracts evidenced by that certificate before a\nreplacement will be issued. The unit agreement and\nthe unit agreement without holders\u2019 obligations\nwill provide that, notwithstanding the foregoing,\nno replacement certificate need be delivered:\n                                                   \n     during                                        \n     the period beginning 15 days before the day   \n     of mailing of a notice of redemption or of    \n     any other exercise of any right held by us    \n  \u25cf  with respect to the unit or any security      \n     constituting                                  \n     such unit evidenced by the mutilated,         \n     destroyed, lost or stolen certificate and     \n     ending                                        \n     on the day of the giving of that notice;      \n                                                   \n                                                   \n     if                                            \n     the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen      \n  \u25cf  certificate evidences any security selected   \n     or called for redemption or other exercise    \n     of a right held by us; or                     \n                                                   \n                                                   \n     at                                            \n     any time on or after the date of settlement   \n     or redemption for any purchase contract       \n     included                                      \n     in the unit, or at any time on or after the   \n     last exercise date for any warrant included   \n  \u25cf  in the unit, evidenced by the mutilated,      \n     destroyed, lost or stolen certificate,        \n     except                                        \n     with respect to any units that remain or      \n     will remain outstanding following the date    \n     of                                            \n     settlement or redemption or the last          \n     exercise date.                                \n                                                   \nTitle.We, the unit agent, the trustee, the warrant\nagent and any of our or their agents will treat the\nregistered owner of any unit as its owner,\nnotwithstanding any notice to the contrary, for all\npurposes. New York Law to Govern.The unit\nagreement, the unit agreement without holders\u2019\nobligations, the units and the pre-paid purchase\ncontracts constituting part of the units will be\ngoverned by, and construed in accordance with, the\nlaws of the State of New York. Neither the unit\nagreement nor the unit agreement without holders\u2019\nobligations requires the maintenance of any\nfinancial ratios or specified levels of net worth\nor liquidity. In addition, these agreements do not\ncontain any provisions which would require us to\nrepurchase or redeem or modify the terms of any of\nthe units upon a change of control or other event\ninvolving us which may adversely affect the\ncreditworthiness of the units. 43 Payment of\nAdditional Amounts Unless we specify otherwise in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement, we will not\npay any additional amounts on the units offered\nthereby to compensate any beneficial owner for any\nUnited States tax withheld from payments on such\nunits. 44 DESCRIPTION OF UNITS OF WELLS FARGO\nFINANCE LLC In this \u201cDescription of Units of Wells\nFargo Finance LLC\u201d section, \u201c we,\u201d \u201c us\u201d or \u201c our\u201d\nrefer only to Wells Fargo Finance LLC and not to\nany of our affiliates, including Wells Fargo &\nCompany; references to \u201c Guarantor\u201d refer only to\nWells Fargo & Company and not to any of its\nsubsidiaries or affiliates; and all references to\n\u201cunits\u201d refer only to units issued by Wells Fargo\nFinance LLC and not to any units issued by Wells\nFargo & Company.

As a result, such successor entity may\nexercise the Guarantor\u2019s rights and powers under\nthe unit agreement or the unit agreement without\nholders\u2019 obligations, as applicable, in the name of\nthe Guarantor and, except in the case of a lease of\nall or substantially all of the Guarantor\u2019s\nproperties, the Guarantor will be released from all\nits liabilities and obligations under the unit\nagreement and the unit agreement without holders\u2019\nobligations and under the units. The successor\nentity to a consolidation or merger may be a\nsubsidiary of the Guarantor. In addition, the unit\nagreement and the unit agreement without holders\u2019\nobligations permit the Guarantor to convey,\ntransfer or lease all or substantially all of its\nassets to one or more of its subsidiaries without\nany restriction and, in that event, those\nsubsidiaries would not be required under the unit\nagreement or the unit agreement without holders\u2019\nobligations to assume the Guarantor\u2019s liabilities\nand obligations under the unit agreement or the\nunit agreement without holders\u2019 obligations and the\nunits. No Trust Indenture Act Qualification.The\nunit agreement and the unit agreement without\nholders\u2019 obligations will not be qualified as\nindentures under, and the unit agent will not be\nrequired to qualify as a trustee under, the Trust\nIndenture Act. Accordingly, the holders of units\nand purchase contracts will not have the benefits\nof the protections of the Trust Indenture Act.\nReplacement of Unit Certificates.We will replace\nany mutilated certificate evidencing a definitive\nunit or purchase contract at the expense of the\nholder upon surrender of that certificate to the\nunit agent.

The applicable prospectus supplement\nwill also specify the methods by which the holders\nmay purchase or sell the purchase contract property\nand any acceleration, cancellation or termination\nprovisions or other provisions relating to the\nsettlement of a purchase contract. Although we\nanticipate making payments on most purchase\ncontracts in U.S. dollars, payments on some\npurchase contracts may be in a foreign currency as\nspecified in the applicable prospectus supplement.\nCurrently, few facilities exist in the United\nStates to convert U.S. dollars into foreign\ncurrencies and vice versa. In addition, most United\nStates banks do not offer non-U.S. dollar\ndenominated checking or savings account facilities.\nAccordingly, unless alternative arrangements are\nmade, we will make payments on purchase contracts\nthat are payable in a foreign currency to an\naccount at a bank outside the United States, which,\nin the case of a payment to be made in euros, will\nbe made by credit or transfer to a euro account\nspecified by the payee in a country for which the\neuro is the lawful currency. 52 Pre-Paid Purchase\nContracts Purchase contracts may require holders to\nsatisfy their obligations under the purchase\ncontracts at the time they are issued (\u201c pre-paid\npurchase contracts\u201d). In certain circumstances, our\nobligation to settle pre-paid purchase contracts on\nthe relevant settlement date may constitute our\nsenior indebtedness. Purchase Contracts Issued as\nPart of Units Purchase contracts issued as part of\na unit will be governed by the terms and provisions\nof a unit agreement or, in the case of pre-paid\npurchase contracts issued as part of a unit that\ncontains no other purchase contracts, a unit\nagreement without holders\u2019 obligations.

The unit agent\nwill not so apply such principal payments if the\nholder has delivered cash to meet its obligations\nunder the purchase contract. To settle the purchase\ncontract and receive the purchase contract\nproperty, the holder must present and surrender the\nunit certificates at the office of the unit agent.\nIf a holder settles its obligations under a\npurchase contract that is part of a unit in cash\nrather than by delivering the debt security that is\npart of the unit, that debt security will remain\noutstanding if the maturity extends beyond the\nrelevant settlement date and, as more fully\ndescribed in the applicable prospectus supplement,\nthe holder will receive that debt security or an\ninterest in the relevant global security. Pledge by\nPurchase Contract Holders to Secure Performance. To\nsecure the obligations of the purchase contract\nholders contained in the purchase contracts that\nare issued as part of a unit and in the unit\nagreement, the holders, acting through the unit\nagent, as their attorney-in-fact, will assign and\npledge the items in the following sentence (the \u201c\npledge\u201d) to a bank or trust company selected by us,\nin its capacity as collateral agent, for our\nbenefit. The pledge is a security interest in, and\na lien upon and right of set-off against, all of\nthe holders\u2019 right, title and interest in and to:\n                                                   \n     any                                           \n     debt securities or other property that are    \n     or become part of units that include the      \n  \u25cf  purchase                                      \n     contracts, or other property as may be        \n     specified in the applicable prospectus        \n     supplement                                    \n     (the \u201cpledged items\u201d);                        \n                                                   \n                                                   \n     all                                           \n     additions to and substitutions for the        \n  \u25cf  pledged items as may be permissible, if so    \n     specified                                     \n     in the applicable prospectus supplement;      \n                                                   \n53\n                                                   \n     all                                           \n     income, proceeds and collections received or  \n  \u25cf  to be received, or derived or to be derived,  \n     at any time from or in connection with the    \n     pledged items described in the two clauses    \n     above; and                                    \n                                                   \n                                                   \n     all                                           \n  \u25cf  powers and rights owned or thereafter         \n     acquired under or with respect to the         \n     pledged items.                                \n                                                   \nThe pledge constitutes collateral security for the\nperformance when due by each holder of its\nobligations under the unit agreement and the\napplicable purchase contract. The collateral agent\nwill forward all payments from the pledged items to\nus, unless such payments have been released from\nthe pledge in accordance with the unit agreement.\nWe will use the payments received from the pledged\nitems to satisfy the obligations of the holder of\nthe unit under the related purchase contract.\nProperty Held in Trust by Unit Agent.If a holder\nfails to settle in cash its obligations under a\npurchase contract that is part of a unit and fails\nto present and surrender its unit certificate to\nthe unit agent when required, that holder will not\nreceive the purchase contract property. Instead,\nthe unit agent will hold that holder\u2019s purchase\ncontract property, together with any distributions,\nas the registered owner in trust for the benefit of\nthe holder until the holder presents and surrenders\nthe certificate or provides satisfactory evidence\nthat the certificate has been destroyed, lost or\nstolen. We or the unit agent may require an\nindemnity from the holder for liabilities related\nto any destroyed, lost or stolen certificate. If\nthe holder does not present the unit certificate,\nor provide the necessary evidence of destruction or\nloss and indemnity, on or before the second\nanniversary of the settlement date of the related\npurchase contract, the unit agent will pay to us\nthe amounts it received in trust for that holder.\nThereafter, the holder may recover those amounts\nonly from us and not the unit agent. The unit agent\nwill have no obligation to invest or to pay\ninterest on any amounts it holds in trust pending\ndistribution. Title.We, the unit agent, the\ntrustee, the warrant agent and any of our or their\nagents will treat the registered holder of any\npurchase contract as the owner, notwithstanding any\nnotice to the contrary, for all purposes. Payment\nof Additional Amounts Unless we specify otherwise\nin the applicable prospectus supplement, we will\nnot pay any additional amounts on the purchase\ncontracts offered thereby to compensate any\nbeneficial owner for any United States tax withheld\nfrom payments on such purchase contracts. 54\nDESCRIPTION OF PURCHASE CONTRACTS OF WELLS FARGO\nFINANCE LLC In this \u201cDescription of Purchase\nContracts of Wells Fargo Finance LLC\u201d section, \u201c\nwe,\u201d \u201c us\u201d or \u201c our\u201d refer only to Wells Fargo\nFinance LLC and not to any of our affiliates,\nincluding Wells Fargo & Company; references to \u201c\nGuarantor\u201d refer only to Wells Fargo & Company and\nnot to any of its subsidiaries or affiliates; and\nall references to \u201cpurchase contracts\u201d refer only\nto purchase contracts issued by Wells Fargo Finance\nLLC and not to any purchase contracts issued by\nWells Fargo & Company.

General\nWe may issue purchase contracts, including purchase\ncontracts issued as part of a unit with one or more\nwarrants, debt securities issued by us or other\nsecurities of an entity affiliated or not\naffiliated with the Guarantor or any combination of\nthese securities. The Guarantor will fully and\nunconditionally guarantee the full and punctual\npayment of amounts payable under the purchase\ncontracts when the same becomes due and payable,\nwhether at expiration, upon exercise, redemption or\nrepurchase at the option of the holders of the\napplicable purchase contracts. The applicable\nprospectus supplement will describe the specific\nterms of the guarantee. Such purchase contracts may\nbe for the purchase or sale of:\n                                                   \n     securities                                    \n  \u25cf  issued by an entity not affiliated with the   \n     Guarantor;                                    \n                                                   \n                  \n  \u25cf  currencies;  \n                  \n                   \n  \u25cf  commodities;  \n                   \n                               \n  \u25cf  other                     \n     specified securities; or  \n                               \n                                                   \n     any                                           \n  \u25cf  combination of the above, including indices   \n     or baskets thereof.                           \n                                                   \nThis property in the above clauses is referred to\nin this \u201cDescription of Purchase Contracts of Wells\nFargo Finance LLC\u201d section as \u201c purchase contract\nproperty.\u201d Each purchase contract will obligate the\nholder to purchase or sell, and obligate us to sell\nor purchase, on specified dates, the purchase\ncontract property at a specified price or prices,\nall as described in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. The applicable prospectus supplement\nwill also specify the methods by which the holders\nmay purchase or sell the purchase contract property\nand any acceleration, cancellation or termination\nprovisions or other provisions relating to the\nsettlement of a purchase contract. We will satisfy\nour obligations, if any, with respect to any\npurchase contracts by delivering the cash value of\nthe purchase contract property, as described in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. Although we\nanticipate making payments on most purchase\ncontracts in U.S. dollars, payments on some\npurchase contracts may be in a foreign currency as\nspecified in the applicable prospectus supplement.\nCurrently, 55 few facilities exist in the United\nStates to convert U.S. dollars into foreign\ncurrencies and vice versa. In addition, most United\nStates banks do not offer non-U.S. dollar\ndenominated checking or savings account facilities.\nAccordingly, unless alternative arrangements are\nmade, we will make payments on purchase contracts\nthat are payable in a foreign currency to an\naccount at a bank outside the United States, which,\nin the case of a payment to be made in euros, will\nbe made by credit or transfer to a euro account\nspecified by the payee in a country for which the\neuro is the lawful currency. Pre-Paid Purchase\nContracts Purchase contracts may require holders to\nsatisfy their obligations under the purchase\ncontracts at the time they are issued. In certain\ncircumstances, our obligation to settle pre-paid\npurchase contracts on the relevant settlement date\nmay constitute our senior indebtedness. Purchase\nContracts Issued as Part of Units Purchase\ncontracts issued as part of a unit will be governed\nby the terms and provisions of a unit agreement or,\nin the case of pre-paid purchase contracts issued\nas part of a unit that contains no other purchase\ncontracts, a unit agreement without holders\u2019\nobligations. See \u201cDescription of Units of Wells\nFargo Finance LLC\u2014Significant Provisions of the\nUnit Agreement\u201d and \u201c\u2014Significant Provisions of the\nUnit Agreement Without Holders\u2019 Obligations.\u201d The\napplicable prospectus supplement will specify the\nfollowing:\n                                                   \n     whether                                       \n  \u25cf  the purchase contract obligates the holder    \n     to purchase or sell the purchase contract     \n     property;                                     \n                                                   \n                                                   \n     whether                                       \n     and when a purchase contract issued as part   \n  \u25cf  of a unit may be separated from the other     \n     securities or other property comprised by     \n     such unit prior to such purchase contract\u2019s   \n     settlement date;                              \n                                                   \n                                                   \n     the                                           \n  \u25cf  methods by which the holders may purchase or  \n     sell the purchase contract property;          \n                                                   \n                                                   \n     any                                           \n  \u25cf  acceleration, cancellation or termination     \n     provisions or other provisions relating to    \n     the settlement of a purchase contract; and    \n                                                   \n                                                   \n     whether                                       \n     the purchase contracts will be issued in      \n     definitive or global form or in any           \n     combination                                   \n  \u25cf  of such forms, although, in any case, the     \n     form of the purchase contract included in a   \n     unit will correspond to the form of the unit  \n     and of any debt security or warrant included  \n     in that unit.                                 \n                                                   \nSettlement of Purchase Contracts.Where purchase\ncontracts issued together with debt securities as\npart of a unit require the holders to buy purchase\ncontract property, the unit agent may apply\nprincipal payments from such debt securities in\nsatisfaction of the holders\u2019 obligations under the\nrelated purchase contract as specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. The unit agent\nwill not so apply such principal payments if the\nholder has delivered cash to meet its obligations\nunder the purchase contract. To settle the purchase\ncontract and receive the purchase contract\nproperty, the holder must present and surrender the\nunit certificates at the office of the unit agent.\nIf a holder settles its obligations under a\npurchase contract that is part of a unit in cash\nrather than by delivering the debt security that is\npart of the unit, that debt security will remain\noutstanding if the maturity extends beyond the\nrelevant settlement date and, as more fully\ndescribed in the applicable prospectus supplement,\nthe holder will receive that debt security or an\ninterest in the relevant global security. Pledge by\nPurchase Contract Holders to Secure Performance.To\nsecure the obligations of the purchase contract\nholders contained in the purchase contracts that\nare issued as part of a unit and in the unit\nagreement, the holders, acting through the unit\nagent, as their attorney-in-fact, will assign and\npledge the items in the following sentence to a\nbank or trust company selected by us, in its\ncapacity as collateral agent, for our benefit. The\npledge is a security interest in, and a lien upon\nand right of set-off against, all of the holders\u2019\nright, title and interest in and to:\n                     \n  \u25cf  the             \n     pledged items;  \n                     \n56\n                                                   \n     all                                           \n     additions to and substitutions for the        \n  \u25cf  pledged items as may be permissible, if so    \n     specified                                     \n     in the applicable prospectus supplement;      \n                                                   \n                                                   \n     all                                           \n     income, proceeds and collections received or  \n  \u25cf  to be received, or derived or to be derived,  \n     at any time from or in connection with the    \n     pledged items described in the two clauses    \n     above; and                                    \n                                                   \n                                                   \n     all                                           \n  \u25cf  powers and rights owned or thereafter         \n     acquired under or with respect to the         \n     pledged items.                                \n                                                   \nThe pledge constitutes collateral security for the\nperformance when due by each holder of its\nobligations under the unit agreement and the\napplicable purchase contract. The collateral agent\nwill forward all payments from the pledged items to\nus, unless such payments have been released from\nthe pledge in accordance with the unit agreement.\nWe will use the payments received from the pledged\nitems to satisfy the obligations of the holder of\nthe unit under the related purchase contract.\nProperty Held in Trust by Unit Agent.If a holder\nfails to settle in cash its obligations under a\npurchase contract that is part of a unit and fails\nto present and surrender its unit certificate to\nthe unit agent when required, that holder will not\nreceive the purchase contract property. Instead,\nthe unit agent will hold that holder\u2019s purchase\ncontract property, together with any distributions,\nas the registered owner in trust for the benefit of\nthe holder until the holder presents and surrenders\nthe certificate or provides satisfactory evidence\nthat the certificate has been destroyed, lost or\nstolen. We or the unit agent may require an\nindemnity from the holder for liabilities related\nto any destroyed, lost or stolen certificate. If\nthe holder does not present the unit certificate,\nor provide the necessary evidence of destruction or\nloss and indemnity, on or before the second\nanniversary of the settlement date of the related\npurchase contract, the unit agent will pay to us\nthe amounts it received in trust for that holder.\nThereafter, the holder may recover those amounts\nonly from us and not the unit agent. The unit agent\nwill have no obligation to invest or to pay\ninterest on any amounts it holds in trust pending\ndistribution. Title.We, the Guarantor, the unit\nagent, the trustee, the warrant agent and any of\nour or their agents will treat the registered\nholder of any purchase contract as the owner,\nnotwithstanding any notice to the contrary, for all\npurposes. Payment of Additional Amounts Unless we\nspecify otherwise in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, neither we nor the Guarantor will pay\nany additional amounts on the purchase contracts\noffered thereby to compensate any beneficial owner\nfor any United States tax withheld from payments on\nsuch purchase contracts. 57 PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION\n(CONFLICTS OF INTEREST) We are offering our\nsecurities and Wells Fargo Finance LLC is offering\nits securities fully and unconditionally guaranteed\nby us on a continuing basis through Wells Fargo\nSecurities, LLC and through any additional agents\nnamed in the applicable pricing supplement\n(individually an \u201c agent\u201d and collectively the \u201c\nagents\u201d) who have agreed to use their reasonable\nefforts to solicit purchases of the securities. We\nor Wells Fargo Finance LLC, as applicable, will\nhave the sole right to accept offers to purchase\nthe securities, and we or Wells Fargo Finance LLC,\nas applicable, may reject any offer in whole or in\npart. Each agent may reject, in whole or in part,\nany offer it solicited to purchase securities. We\nor Wells Fargo Finance LLC, as applicable, will pay\nan agent, in connection with sales of these\nsecurities resulting from a solicitation that such\nagent made or an offer to purchase that such agent\nreceived, a commission in an amount agreed upon at\nthe time of sale. Such commission will be set forth\nin the applicable pricing supplement. The discount\nor commission that may be received by any member of\nFINRA for any sales of securities pursuant to this\nprospectus, together with the reimbursement of any\ncounsel fees by us and/or Wells Fargo Finance LLC,\nwill not exceed 8.00% of the initial gross proceeds\nfrom the sale of any securities being sold. Any\nagreement that we enter into with agents will\ncontain, to the extent required, contractual\nprovisions required to comply with the\n\u201cRestrictions on Qualified Financial Contracts of\nSystemically Important U.S. Banking Organizations\nand the U.S. Operations of Systemically Important\nForeign Banking Organizations; Revisions to the\nDefinition of Qualifying Master Netting Agreement\nand Related Definitions\u201d as issued by the FRB, the\nFDIC and the OCC and other applicable law. Offers\nto purchase securities are being solicited, from\ntime to time, by the agent. The agent has agreed to\nuse its reasonable efforts to sell the securities.\nWe and Wells Fargo Finance LLC may also sell the\nsecurities to an agent as principal for its own\naccount at a discount to be agreed upon at the time\nof sale. Such discount will be set forth in the\napplicable pricing supplement. That agent may\nresell the securities to investors and other\npurchasers at a fixed offering price or at\nprevailing market prices, or prices related thereto\nat the time of resale or otherwise, as that agent\ndetermines and as we or Wells Fargo Finance LLC, as\napplicable, will specify in the applicable pricing\nsupplement. Unless the applicable pricing\nsupplement states otherwise, any securities sold to\nagents as principal will be purchased at a price\nequal to 100% of the principal amount less the\nagreed upon discount. An agent may offer the\nsecurities it has purchased as principal to other\ndealers. The agent may sell the securities to any\ndealer at a discount and, unless otherwise\nspecified in the applicable pricing supplement, the\ndiscount allowed to any other dealer will not be in\nexcess of the discount that the agent will receive\nfrom us or Wells Fargo Finance LLC, as applicable.\nAfter the initial public offering of securities\nthat an agent is to resell on a fixed public\noffering price basis, the agent may change the\npublic offering price and discount. We and Wells\nFargo Finance LLC may arrange for securities to be\nsold through agents or may sell securities directly\nto investors on our or Wells Fargo Finance LLC\u2019s,\nas applicable, own behalf or through an affiliate.\nNo commissions will be paid on securities sold\ndirectly by us or Wells Fargo Finance LLC. We or\nWells Fargo Finance LLC, as applicable, may accept\noffers to purchase securities through additional\nagents and may appoint additional agents to solicit\noffers to purchase securities. Any other agents\nwill be named in the applicable pricing supplement.\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, one of our wholly-\nowned subsidiaries and an affiliate of Wells Fargo\nFinance LLC, will comply with Rule 5121 of the\nConduct Rules of FINRA in connection with each\nplacement of the securities in which it\nparticipates. If Wells Fargo Securities, LLC or one\nof our other wholly-owned subsidiaries or\naffiliated entities participates in a sale of the\nsecurities, such subsidiary or entity will not\nconfirm sales to accounts over which they exercise\ndiscretionary authority without the prior specific\nwritten approval of the customer in accordance with\nRule 5121. Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo\nAdvisors (the trade name of the retail brokerage\nbusiness of Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC and\nWells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC) or\nanother of our and Wells Fargo Finance LLC\u2019s\naffiliates may use the applicable pricing\nsupplement, the applicable prospectus supplement\nand any related product supplement and/or other\nsupplement and this prospectus for offers and sales\nrelated to market-making transactions in the\nsecurities. Such entities may act as principal or\nagent in these transactions, and the sales will be\nmade at prices related to prevailing market prices\nat the time of sale. 58 Each of the agents may be\ndeemed to be an \u201cunderwriter\u201d within the meaning of\nthe Securities Act. We and Wells Fargo Finance LLC\nand the agents have agreed to indemnify each other\nagainst certain liabilities, including liabilities\nunder the Securities Act, or to contribute to\npayments made in respect of those liabilities. We\nand Wells Fargo Finance LLC have also agreed to\nreimburse the agents for specified expenses. We and\nWells Fargo Finance LLC estimate that we and Wells\nFargo Finance LLC will spend approximately\n$12,096,900 for legal fees, printing fees, trustee\nfees, CUSIP fees, rating agency fees and other\nexpenses allocable to the offering, including, for\nsecurities linked to an index, a licensing fee\npayable to the sponsor of the index. The original\npublic offering price of an offering of securities\nwill include the agent discount or commission\nindicated in the applicable pricing supplement, the\noffering expenses described in the preceding\nparagraph associated with that offering, the\nprojected profit our or Wells Fargo Finance LLC\u2019s\nhedge counterparty expects to realize in\nconsideration for assuming the risks inherent in\nhedging our or Wells Fargo Finance LLC\u2019s\nobligations under the securities and any other\ncosts identified in the applicable pricing\nsupplement. We and Wells Fargo Finance LLC expect\nto hedge our or Wells Fargo Finance LLC\u2019s, as\napplicable, obligations under the securities\nthrough affiliated or unaffiliated counterparties.\nBecause hedging our and Wells Fargo Finance LLC\u2019s\nobligations entails risk and may be influenced by\nmarket forces beyond our or Wells Fargo Finance\nLLC\u2019s or our or Wells Fargo Finance LLC\u2019s\ncounterparty\u2019s control, such hedging may result in\na profit that is more or less than expected, or\ncould result in a loss. The discount or commission,\noffering expenses, projected profit of our or Wells\nFargo Finance LLC\u2019s hedge counterparty and any\nother costs identified in the applicable pricing\nsupplement reduce the economic terms of the\nsecurities. In addition, the fact that the original\noffering price includes these items is expected to\nadversely affect the secondary market prices of the\nsecurities. These secondary market prices are also\nlikely to be reduced by the cost of unwinding the\nrelated hedging transaction. When we and Wells\nFargo Finance LLC issue the securities offered by\nthis prospectus, except for securities issued upon\na reopening of an existing tranche or series of\nsecurities, they will be new securities without an\nestablished trading market. Unless otherwise\nprovided in the applicable pricing supplement,\nneither we nor Wells Fargo Finance LLC intend to\napply for the listing of the securities on any\nnational securities exchange or automated quotation\nsystem. An agent may make a market for the\nsecurities, as applicable laws and regulations\npermit, but is not obligated to do so and may\ndiscontinue making a market in any or all of the\nsecurities at any time without notice. No assurance\ncan be given as to the liquidity of any trading\nmarket for these securities. When an agent acts as\nprincipal for its own account, to facilitate the\noffering of the securities, the agent may engage in\ntransactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise\naffect the price of the securities. Specifically,\nthe agent may overallot in connection with any\noffering of the securities, creating a short\nposition in the securities for its own account. In\naddition, to cover overallotments or to stabilize\nthe price of the securities, the agent may bid for,\nand purchase, the securities in the open market.\nFinally, in any offering of the securities by an\nagent through dealers, the agent may reclaim\nselling concessions allowed to a dealer for\ndistributing the securities in the offering if the\nagent repurchases previously distributed securities\nin stabilization transactions or otherwise. Any of\nthese activities may stabilize or maintain the\nmarket price of the securities above independent\nmarket levels. The agents are not required to\nengage in these activities, and may end any of\nthese activities at any time. Purchasers of our and\nWells Fargo Finance LLC\u2019s securities may be\nrequired to pay stamp taxes and other charges in\naccordance with the laws and practices of the\ncountry of purchase in addition to the original\npublic offering price disclosed in the applicable\npricing supplement. Agents and their affiliates may\nbe customers of, engage in transactions with, or\nperform services, including investment and/or\ncommercial banking services, for us, Wells Fargo\nFinance LLC, our subsidiaries or Wells Fargo\nFinance LLC\u2019s affiliates in the ordinary course of\ntheir businesses. In connection with the\ndistribution of the securities offered under this\nprospectus, we and Wells Fargo Finance LLC may\nenter into swap or other hedging transactions with,\nor arranged by, agents or their affiliates. These\nagents or their affiliates may receive\ncompensation, trading gain or other benefits from\nthese transactions. 59 Delivery of the securities\nwill be made against payment therefor on or about\nthe issue date specified in the applicable pricing\nsupplement. As of the date of this prospectus,\nunder Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in\nthe secondary market generally are required to\nsettle in two business days after the date the\nsecurities are priced (\u201c T+2\u201d), unless the parties\nto any such trade expressly agree otherwise.\nAccordingly, if the applicable pricing supplement\nspecifies that the issue date is more than two\nbusiness days after the date on which the\nsecurities are priced, purchasers who wish to trade\nsuch securities at any time prior to the second\nbusiness day preceding the issue date will be\nrequired, by virtue of the fact that the securities\nwill not settle in T+2, to specify an alternative\nsettlement cycle at the time of any such trade to\nprevent a failed settlement; such purchasers should\nalso consult their own advisors in this regard. In\nFebruary 2023, Rule 15c6-1 was amended to require\ntrades in the secondary market to settle in one\nbusiness day after the date the securities are\npriced (\u201c T+1\u201d), effective May 28, 2024. Therefore,\nfor any securities offered under this prospectus on\nor after the May 28, 2024 effective date, the same\nprocess described in this paragraph will apply and\npurchasers who wish to trade such securities at any\ntime prior to the first business day preceding the\nissue date will be required to specify an\nalternative settlement cycle as described in this\nparagraph. Each agent will agree that it will, to\nthe best of its knowledge and belief, comply with\nall applicable securities laws and regulations in\nforce in any jurisdiction in which it purchases,\noffers, sells or delivers our and Wells Fargo\nFinance LLC\u2019s securities or possesses or\ndistributes this prospectus or any other offering\nmaterial and will obtain any required consent,\napproval or permission for its purchase, offer,\nsale or delivery of such securities under the laws\nand regulations in force in any jurisdiction to\nwhich it is subject or in which it makes purchases,\noffers, sales or deliveries. Neither we nor Wells\nFargo Finance LLC will have any responsibility for\nan agent\u2019s compliance with applicable securities\nlaws. In addition to the above, we may sell our\nsecurities and Wells Fargo Finance LLC may sell its\nsecurities fully and unconditionally guaranteed by\nus through other agents, underwriters or dealers or\ndirectly to one or more purchasers. In this case,\nthe applicable prospectus supplement or pricing\nsupplement will include additional information with\nrespect to the plan of distribution, including the\nterms of the offering. 60 LEGAL OPINIONS Faegre\nDrinker Biddle & Reath LLP will issue opinions\nregarding the legality of the securities offered by\nthis prospectus.

Article Fourteenth of the restated\ncertificate of incorporation of Wells Fargo &\nCompany, as amended, provides for broad\nindemnification of directors and officers. Wells\nFargo & Company also maintains insurance coverage\nrelating to certain liabilities of directors and\nofficers.

(5) That,\nfor the purpose of determining liability of a\nRegistrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any\npurchaser in the initial distribution of the\nsecurities: Each of the undersigned Registrants\nundertakes that in a primary offering of securities\nof such undersigned Registrant pursuant to this\nRegistration Statement, regardless of the\nunderwriting method used to sell the securities to\nthe purchaser, if the securities are offered or\nsold to such purchaser by means of any of the\nfollowing communications, such undersigned\nRegistrant will be a seller to the purchaser and\nwill be considered to offer or sell such securities\nto such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus\nor prospectus of such undersigned Registrant\nrelating to the offering required to be filed\npursuant to Rule 424; (ii) Any free writing\nprospectus relating to the offering prepared by or\non behalf of such undersigned Registrant or used or\nreferred to by such undersigned Registrant; (iii)\nThe portion of any other free writing prospectus\nrelating to the offering containing material\ninformation about such undersigned Registrant or\nits securities provided by or on behalf of such\nundersigned Registrant; and (iv) Any other\ncommunication that is an offer in the offering made\nby such undersigned Registrant to the purchaser.\n(b) Each of the undersigned Registrant hereby\nundertakes that, for purposes of determining any\nliability under the Securities Act of 1933, each\nfiling of the Wells Fargo & Company annual report\npursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 that is\nincorporated by reference in the Registration\nStatement shall be deemed to be a new registration\nstatement relating to the securities offered\ntherein, and the offering of such securities at\nthat time shall be deemed to be the initial bona\nfideoffering thereof. (c) Insofar as\nindemnification for liabilities arising under the\nSecurities Act of 1933 may be permitted to\ndirectors, officers and controlling persons of a\nRegistrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or\notherwise, such Registrant has been advised that in\nthe opinion of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission such indemnification is against public\npolicy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933\nand is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that\na claim for indemnification against such\nliabilities (other than the payment by such\nRegistrant of expenses incurred or paid by a\ndirector, officer or controlling person of such\nRegistrant in the successful defense of any action,\nsuit or proceeding) is asserted by such director,\nofficer, or controlling person in connection with\nthe securities being registered, such Registrant\nwill, unless in the opinion of its counsel the\nmatter has been settled by controlling precedent,\nsubmit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the\nquestion whether such indemnification by it is\nagainst public policy as expressed in the\nSecurities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the\nfinal adjudication of such issue.
