Commercial\nBanking; Corporate and\nInvestment Banking; and Wealth\nand Investment Management. All\nother business activities that\nare not included in the\nreportable operating segments\nhave been included in\nCorporate. For additional\ninformation, see Table 5 below.\nWe define our reportable\noperating segments by type of\nproduct and customer segment,\nand their results are based on\nour management reporting\nprocess. The management\nreporting process measures the\nperformance of the reportable\noperating segments based on the\nCompany\u2019s management structure,\nand the results are regularly\nreviewed with our Chief\nExecutive Officer and relevant\nsenior management. The\nmanagement reporting process is\nbased on U.S. GAAP and includes\nspecific adjustments, such as\nfunds transfer pricing for\nasset/liability management,\nshared revenue and expenses,\nand taxable-equivalent\nadjustments to consistently\nreflect income from taxable and\ntax-exempt sources, which\nallows management to assess\nperformance consistently across\nthe operating segments.\n\nFunds Transfer Pricing.\nCorporate treasury manages a\nfunds transfer pricing\nmethodology that considers\ninterest rate risk, liquidity\nrisk, and other product\ncharacteristics. Operating\nsegments pay a funding charge\nfor their assets and receive a\nfunding credit for their\ndeposits, both of which are\nincluded in net interest\nincome. The net impact of the\nfunding charges or credits is\nrecognized in corporate\ntreasury.\n\nRevenue Sharing and Expense\nAllocations. When lines of\nbusiness jointly serve\ncustomers, the line of business\nthat is responsible for\nproviding the product or\nservice recognizes revenue or\nexpense with a referral fee\npaid or an allocation of cost\nto the other line of business\nbased on established internal\nrevenue-sharing agreements.\n\nWhen a line of business uses a\nservice provided by another\nline of business, expense is\ngenerally allocated based on\nthe cost and use of the service\nprovided. Enterprise functions,\nsuch as operations, technology,\nand risk management, are\nincluded in Corporate with an\nallocation of their applicable\ncosts to the reportable\noperating segments based on the\nlevel of support provided by\nthe enterprise function. We\nperiodically assess and update\nour revenue sharing and expense\nallocation methodologies.\n\nTaxable-Equivalent Adjustments.\nTaxable-equivalent adjustments\nrelated to tax-exempt income on\ncertain loans and debt\nsecurities are included in net\ninterest income, while taxable-\nequivalent adjustments related\nto income tax credits for\naffordable housing and\nrenewable energy investments\nare included in noninterest\nincome, in each case with\ncorresponding impacts to income\ntax expense (benefit).\nAdjustments are included in\nCorporate, Commercial Banking,\nand Corporate and Investment\nBanking and are eliminated to\nreconcile to the Company\u2019s\nconsolidated financial results.\n\nAllocated Capital. Reportable\noperating segments are\nallocated capital under a risk-\nsensitive framework that is\nprimarily based on aspects of\nour regulatory capital\nrequirements, and the\nassumptions and methodologies\nused to allocate capital are\nperiodically assessed and\nupdated. Management believes\nthat return on allocated\ncapital is a useful financial\nmeasure because it enables\nmanagement, investors, and\nothers to assess a reportable\noperating segment\u2019s use of\ncapital.\n\nSelected Metrics.

Management believes\nthat advisory assets is a\nuseful metric because it allows\nmanagement, investors, and\nothers to assess how changes in\nasset amounts may impact the\ngeneration of certain asset-\nbased fees.

These\ntransactions are designed to\n(1) meet the financial needs of\ncustomers, (2) manage our\ncredit, market or liquidity\nrisks, and/or (3) diversify our\nfunding sources.\n                                                                \n  Unfunded Credit Commitments                                   \n                                                                \nUnfunded credit commitments are\nlegally binding agreements to\nlend to customers with terms\ncovering usage of funds,\ncontractual interest rates,\nexpiration dates, and any\nrequired collateral. The\nmaximum credit risk for these\ncommitments will generally be\nlower than the contractual\namount because these\ncommitments may expire without\nbeing used or may be cancelled\nat the customer\u2019s request. Our\ncredit risk monitoring\nactivities include managing the\namount of commitments, both to\nindividual customers and in\ntotal, and the size and\nmaturity structure of these\ncommitments.

We also enter\ninto other commitments such as\ncommitments to purchase\nsecurities under resale\nagreements.

The notional amount\nis not recorded on our\nconsolidated balance sheet and\nis not, when viewed in\nisolation, a meaningful measure\nof the risk profile of the\ninstruments.

COMMERCIAL AND\nINDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE\nFINANCING. For purposes of\nportfolio risk management, we\naggregate commercial and\nindustrial loans and lease\nfinancing according to market\nsegmentation and standard\nindustry codes. We generally\nsubject commercial and\nindustrial loans and lease\nfinancing to individual risk\nassessment using our internal\nborrower and collateral quality\nratings. Our ratings are\naligned to regulatory\ndefinitions of pass and\ncriticized categories with\ncriticized segmented among\nspecial mention, substandard,\ndoubtful, and loss categories.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    25  \n                               \nRisk Management \u2013 Credit Risk\nManagement (continued)\n\nGenerally, the primary source\nof repayment for our commercial\nand industrial loans and lease\nfinancing portfolio is the\noperating cash flows of\ncustomers, with the collateral\nsecuring this portfolio\nrepresenting a secondary source\nof repayment. The majority of\nthis portfolio is secured by\nshort-term assets, such as\naccounts receivable, inventory,\nand debt securities, as well as\nlong-lived assets, such as\nequipment and other business\nassets.\n\nWe had $16.0 billion of the\ncommercial and industrial loans\nand lease financing portfolio\nclassified as criticized in\naccordance with\n\nregulatory guidance at March\n31, 2025, compared with $16.5\nbillion at December 31, 2024.\n\nThe portfolio increased at\nMarch 31, 2025, compared with\nDecember 31, 2024, as a result\nof increased originations and\nloan draws, partially offset by\npaydowns.

Our\nresidential mortgage loan\nportfolio is composed of 1\u20134\nfamily first and junior lien\nmortgage loans. Junior lien\nmortgage loans consist of\nresidential mortgage lines of\ncredit and loans that are\nsubordinate in rights to an\nexisting lien on the same\nproperty. Residential mortgage\n\u2013 first lien loans represented\n96% of the total residential\nmortgage loan portfolio at both\nMarch 31, 2025, and December\n31, 2024.\n\nThe residential mortgage loan\nportfolio includes loans with\nadjustable-rate features. We\nmonitor the risk of default as\na result of interest rate\nincreases on adjustable-rate\nmortgage (ARM) loans, which may\nbe mitigated by product\nfeatures that limit the amount\nof the increase in the\ncontractual interest rate. The\ndefault risk of these loans is\nconsidered in our ACL for\nloans. ARM loans were $66.6\nbillion, or 7% of total loans,\nat March 31, 2025, compared\nwith $66.3 billion, or 7% of\ntotal loans, at December 31,\n2024, with an initial reset\ndate in 2027 or later for the\nmajority of this portfolio at\nMarch 31, 2025. We do not offer\noption ARM products, nor do we\noffer variable-rate mortgage\nproducts with fixed payment\namounts, commonly referred to\nwithin the financial services\nindustry as negative amortizing\nmortgage loans.\n\nThe outstanding balance of\nresidential mortgage lines of\ncredit (both first and junior\nlien) was $11.8 billion at\nMarch 31, 2025, compared with\n$12.4 billion at December 31,\n2024. The unfunded credit\ncommitments for these lines of\ncredit totaled $21.0 billion at\nMarch 31, 2025, compared with\n$22.5 billion at December 31,\n2024.

Our\nperiodic review of this\nportfolio includes original\nappraisals adjusted for the\nchange in Home Price Index\n(HPI) or estimates from\nautomated valuation models\n(AVMs) to support property\nvalues.

For junior lien\nmortgages, LTV uses the total\ncombined loan balance of first\nand junior lien mortgages\n(including unused line of\ncredit amounts). For additional\ninformation regarding credit\nquality indicators, see Note 5\n(Loans and Related Allowance\nfor Credit Losses) to Financial\nStatements in this Report.\n\nWe continue to modify\nresidential mortgage loans to\nassist homeowners and other\nborrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulties.

Additionally, we\nmaintain an ACL for debt\nsecurities classified as either\nAFS or HTM, other financial\nassets measured at amortized\ncost, including deposits with\nbanks, net investments in\nleases, and other off-balance\nsheet credit exposures.\n\nThe process for establishing\nthe ACL for loans takes into\nconsideration many factors,\nincluding historical and\nforecasted loss trends, loan-\nlevel credit quality ratings\nand loan grade-specific\ncharacteristics. The process\ninvolves subjective and\n\ncomplex judgments. In addition,\nwe review a variety of credit\nmetrics and trends.

We weighted the base\nscenario and the downside\nscenarios in our estimate of\nthe ACL for loans at March 31,\n2025. The base scenario assumed\nslowing inflation along with\nslowing economic growth, a\ndecline in commercial real\nestate prices, and stable to\nimproving unemployment rates.\nThe downside scenarios assumed\na more substantial economic\ncontraction due to lower\nbusiness and consumer\nconfidence, declining property\nvalues, and uncertainty related\nto trade policies.\nAdditionally, we consider\nqualitative factors that\nrepresent management\u2019s judgment\nof risks related to our\nprocesses and assumptions used\nin establishing the ACL such as\neconomic environmental factors,\nmodeling assumptions and\nperformance, process risk, and\nother subjective factors,\nincluding industry trends and\nemerging risk assessments, such\nas recent macroeconomic\nuncertainty related to trade\npolicies.

Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be\nbased on a variety of factors, including loan balance changes,\nportfolio credit quality and mix changes, and changes in general\neconomic conditions and expectations (including for unemployment\nand real GDP), among other factors. We believe the ACL for loans\nof $14.6 billion at March 31, 2025, was appropriate to cover\nexpected credit losses, including unfunded credit commitments,\nat that date. The entire allowance is available to absorb credit\nlosses from the total loan portfolio. The ACL for loans is\nsubject to change and reflects existing factors as of the date\nof determination, including economic or market conditions and\nongoing internal and external examination processes. Due to the\nsensitivity of the ACL for loans to changes in the economic and\nbusiness environment, it is possible that we will incur\nincremental credit losses not anticipated as of the balance\nsheet date. Our process for determining the ACL is discussed in\nthe \u201cCritical Accounting Policies \u2013 Allowance for\n\nCredit Losses\u201d section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2024 Form\n10-K. MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES. We sell residential and\ncommercial mortgage loans to various parties. In connection with\nour sales and securitization of residential mortgage loans, we\nhave established a mortgage repurchase liability. For\ninformation on our repurchase liability, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Credit Risk Management \u2013 Mortgage Banking\nActivities\u201d section in our 2024 Form 10-K. In addition to\nservicing loans in our portfolio, we act as servicer of\nresidential and commercial mortgage loans included in\ngovernment-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage securitizations,\nGNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of FHA-insured/VA-\nguaranteed mortgages and private label mortgage securitizations,\nas well as for unsecuritized loans owned by institutional\ninvestors. As a servicer, we are required to advance certain\ndelinquent payments of principal and interest on mortgage loans\nwe service. The amount and timing of reimbursement for advances\nof delinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable\nservicing agreements. See Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities)\nto Financial Statements in this Report for additional\ninformation about residential and commercial servicing rights,\nservicer advances and servicing fees. In accordance with\napplicable servicing guidelines, upon transfer as servicer, we\nhave the option to repurchase loans from certain loan\nsecuritizations, which generally becomes exercisable based on\ndelinquency status such as when three scheduled loan payments\nare past due. When we have the unilateral option to repurchase a\nloan, we recognize the loan and a corresponding liability on our\nbalance sheet regardless of our intent to repurchase the loan.\nWe may repurchase these loans for cash and as a result, our\ntotal consolidated assets do not change. Loans repurchased from\nGNMA securitization pools that regain current status or are\notherwise modified in accordance with applicable servicing\nguidelines may be included in future GNMA loan securitization\npools. At March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, these loans,\nwhich we have repurchased or have the unilateral option to\nrepurchase, were $7.4 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively,\nwhich included $6.9 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, in\nloans held for investment, with the remainder in loans held for\nsale. See Note 13 (Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional\ninformation about our involvement with mortgage loan\nsecuritizations.

Interest\nrate risk is the risk that\nmarket fluctuations in interest\nrates, credit spreads, or\nforeign exchange can cause a\nloss of the Company\u2019s earnings\nand capital stemming from\nmismatches in the cash flows of\nthe Company\u2019s assets and\nliabilities. We are subject to\ninterest rate risk because: \u2022\nassets and liabilities may\nmature or reprice at different\ntimes or by different amounts;\n\u2022 short-term and long-term\nmarket interest rates may\nchange independently or with\ndifferent magnitudes; \u2022 the\nremaining maturity for various\nassets or liabilities may\nshorten or lengthen as interest\nrates change; or \u2022 interest\nrates may also have a direct or\nindirect effect on loan demand,\ncollateral values, credit\nlosses, loan origination\nvolume, and the fair value of\nfinancial instruments and MSRs.\nWe measure interest rate risk\nexposure from customer-related\nlending and deposit-taking\nactivities, as well as from\ninvestments in AFS and HTM debt\nsecurities and from issuances\nof long-term debt. Interest\nrate risk is measured by\ncomparing the earnings outcomes\nfrom multiple interest rate\nscenarios relative to our base\nscenario. The base scenario is\na reference point used by the\nCompany for financial planning\npurposes. These scenarios may\ndiffer in the direction of\ninterest rate changes, the\ndegree and speed of interest\nrate changes over time, and the\nprojected shape of the yield\ncurve. They also require\nassumptions regarding drivers\nof earnings and balance sheet\ncomposition such as loan\noriginations, prepayment rates\non loans and debt securities,\ndeposit flows and mix, as well\nas pricing strategies. We\nperiodically assess and enhance\nour scenarios and assumptions.\nTable 22 presents the results\nof the estimated net interest\nincome sensitivity over the\nnext 12 months from the\nmultiple scenarios compared\nwith our base scenario. These\nhypothetical scenarios include\ninstantaneous movements across\nthe yield curve with both lower\nand higher interest rates under\na parallel shift, as well as\nsteeper and flatter non-\nparallel changes in the yield\ncurve.

For additional\ninformation on the market risk\nof financial instruments used\nin our trading activities,\nwhich are measured at fair\nvalue through earnings, see the\n\u201cRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability Management \u2013\nMarket Risk \u2013 Trading\nActivities\u201d section in this\nReport. Our scenario\nassumptions reflected the\nfollowing: \u2022 Scenarios are\ndynamic and reflect anticipated\nchanges to our assets and\nliabilities over time. \u2022\nMortgage prepayment and\norigination assumptions vary\nacross scenarios and reflect\nonly the impact of the higher\nor lower interest rates. \u2022\nOther macroeconomic variables\nthat could be correlated with\nthe changes in interest rates\nare held constant.\n\n\u2022 The funding forecast in our\nbase scenario incorporates\ndeposit mix changes and market\nfunding levels consistent with\nthe base interest rate\ntrajectory. Our hypothetical\nscenarios incorporate deposit\nmix that is the same as in the\nbase scenario. In higher\ninterest rate scenarios,\npotential customer deposit\nactivity that shifts balances\ninto higher yielding products\nand/or requires additional\nmarket funding could reduce the\nexpected benefit from higher\nrates. Conversely, in lower\ninterest rate scenarios, a\npotential shift to a funding\nmix with lower yielding\ndeposits and/or less market\nfunding could reduce the impact\nof lower rates on earning\nassets in these scenarios. \u2022\nThe interest rate sensitivity\nof deposits as market interest\nrates change, referred to as\ndeposit betas, are informed by\nhistorical behavior and\nexpectations for near-term\npricing strategies. Our actual\nexperience may differ from\nexpectations due to the lag or\nacceleration of deposit\nrepricing, changes in consumer\nbehavior, and other factors.\nTable 22: Net Interest Income\nSensitivity Over the Next 12\nMonths Using Instantaneous\nMovements\n                                                                \n  ($ in                                                         \n  billions)                 Mar 31, 2025          Dec 31, 2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Parallel                                                      \n  shift (1):                                                    \n  +100 bps                                                      \n  shift in         $   1.6                   1.3                \n  interest                                                      \n  rates                                                         \n  -100 bps                                                      \n  shift in            -1.9                  -2.2                \n  interest                                                      \n  rates                                                         \n  -200 bps                                                      \n  shift in            -4.1                  -4.4                \n  interest                                                      \n  rates                                                         \n  Steeper yield                                                 \n  curve (1):                                                    \n  +100 bps                                                      \n  shift in                                                      \n  long-term            0.4                   0.4                \n  interest                                                      \n  rates                                                         \n  -100 bps                                                      \n  shift in                                                      \n  short-term          -1.4                  -1.8                \n  interest                                                      \n  rates                                                         \n  Flatter yield                                                 \n  curve (1):                                                    \n  +100 bps                                                      \n  shift in                                                      \n  short-term           1.2                   0.9                \n  interest                                                      \n  rates                                                         \n  -100 bps                                                      \n  shift in                                                      \n  long-term           -0.4                  -0.4                \n  interest                                                      \n  rates                                                         \n                                                                \n(1) In first quarter 2025, we\nmade an update to exclude the\nnet interest income sensitivity\nfor trading-related assets and\nliabilities of our CIB Markets\ntrading business. Prior period\namounts have been revised to\nconform with the current period\npresentation. The changes in\nour interest rate sensitivity\nfrom December 31, 2024, to\nMarch 31, 2025, reflected\nupdates for our expected\nbalance sheet composition. Our\ninterest rate sensitivity\nindicates that we would expect\nto benefit from higher interest\nrates as our assets would\nreprice faster and to a greater\ndegree than our liabilities,\nwhile in the case of lower\ninterest rates, our assets\nwould reprice downward and to a\ngreater degree than our\nliabilities resulting in lower\nnet interest income. The\nrealized impact of interest\nrate changes may vary from our\nbase and hypothetical scenarios\nfor various reasons, including\nany deposit pricing lags. We\nuse interest rate derivatives\nand our debt securities\nportfolio to manage our\ninterest rate exposures. We use\nderivatives for asset/liability\nmanagement to (i) convert cash\nflows from selected assets\nand/or liabilities from\nfloating-rate payments to\nfixed-rate payments, or vice\nversa, (ii) reduce accumulated\nother comprehensive income\n(AOCI) sensitivity of our AFS\ndebt securities portfolio,\nand/or (iii) economically hedge\nour mortgage origination\npipeline, funded mortgage\nloans, and MSRs. Derivatives\nused to hedge our interest rate\nrisk exposures are presented in\nNote 11 (Derivatives) to\nFinancial Statements in this\nReport. As interest rates\nincrease, changes in the fair\nvalue of AFS debt securities\nmay negatively affect AOCI,\nwhich lowers the amount of our\nregulatory capital. AOCI also\nincludes unrealized gains or\nlosses related to the transfer\nof debt securities from AFS\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    35  \n                               \nRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability Management\n(continued)\n\nto HTM, which are subsequently\namortized into earnings over\nthe life of the security with\nno further impact from interest\nrate changes. See Note 1\n(Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) and Note 3\n(Available-for-Sale and Held-\nto-Maturity Debt Securities) to\nFinancial Statements in this\nReport for additional\ninformation on our debt\nsecurities portfolio.\n\nIn addition to the net interest\nincome sensitivity above, we\nalso measure and evaluate the\neconomic value sensitivity\n(EVS) of our balance sheet. EVS\nis the change in the present\nvalue of the life-time cash\nflows of the Company\u2019s assets\nand liabilities across a range\nof scenarios. It is based on\nthe existing balance sheet, at\na point in time, and helps\nindicate whether we are exposed\nto higher or lower interest\nrates. We manage EVS through a\nset of limits that are designed\nto align with our interest rate\nrisk appetite.\n\nInterest rate sensitive\nnoninterest income is impacted\nby changes in earnings credit\nfor noninterest-bearing\ndeposits that reduce treasury\nmanagement deposit-related\nservice fees on commercial\naccounts. Our interest rate\nsensitive noninterest income is\nalso impacted by mortgage\nbanking activities that may\nhave sensitivity impacts that\nmove in the opposite direction\nof our net interest income. See\nthe \u201cRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability Management \u2013\nMortgage Banking Interest Rate\nand Market Risk\u201d section in our\n2024 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\n\nMORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE\nAND MARKET RISK. We originate\nand service mortgage loans,\nwhich subjects us to various\nrisks, including market,\ninterest rate, credit, and\nliquidity risks that can be\nsubstantial. Based on market\nconditions and other factors,\nwe reduce credit and liquidity\nrisks by selling or\nsecuritizing mortgage loans. We\ndetermine whether mortgage\nloans will be held for\ninvestment or held for sale at\nthe time of commitment, but may\nchange our intent to hold loans\nfor investment or sale as part\nof our corporate\nasset/liability management\nactivities. We may also retain\nsecurities in our investment\nportfolio at the time we\nsecuritize mortgage loans.\n\nChanges in interest rates may\nimpact mortgage banking\nnoninterest income, including\norigination and servicing fees,\nand the fair value of our\nresidential MSRs, LHFS, and\nderivative loan commitments\n(interest rate \u201clocks\u201d)\nextended to mortgage\napplicants. Interest rate\nchanges will generally impact\nour mortgage banking\nnoninterest income on a lagging\nbasis due to the time it takes\nfor the market to reflect a\nshift in customer demand, as\nwell as the time required for\nprocessing a new application,\nproviding the commitment, and\nsecuritizing and selling the\nloan. The amount and timing of\nthe impact will depend on the\nmagnitude, speed and duration\nof the changes in interest\nrates. For additional\ninformation on mortgage\nbanking, including key\nassumptions and the sensitivity\nof the fair value of MSRs, see\nthe \u201cRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability Management \u2013\nMortgage Banking Interest Rate\nand Market Risk\u201d section in our\n2024 Form 10-K and Note 6\n(Mortgage Banking Activities)\nand Note 12 (Fair Value\nMeasurements) to Financial\nStatements in this Report.\n\nMARKET RISK. Market risk is the\nrisk of possible economic loss\nfrom adverse changes in market\nrisk factors such as interest\nrates, credit spreads, foreign\nexchange rates, equity and\ncommodity prices, and the risk\nof possible loss due to\ncounterparty exposure. This\napplies to implied volatility\nrisk, basis risk, and market\nliquidity risk. It includes\nprice risk in the trading book,\nmortgage servicing rights, the\nhedge effectiveness risk\nassociated with the mortgage\nbook held at fair value, and\nimpairment on private equity\ninvestments. For additional\ninformation on our oversight of\nmarket risk, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Asset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Market Risk\u201d\nsection in our 2024 Form 10-K.\n\nMARKET RISK \u2013 TRADING\nACTIVITIES. We engage in\ntrading activities to\naccommodate the investment and\nrisk management activities of\nour customers and to execute\neconomic hedging to manage\ncertain balance sheet risks.\nThese trading activities\npredominantly occur within our\nCIB Markets business. Debt and\nequity securities held for\ntrading, trading loans, and\ntrading derivatives are\nfinancial instruments used in\nour trading activities, and are\nmeasured at fair value through\nearnings. Income earned on the\nfinancial instruments used in\nour trading activities include\nnet interest income, changes in\nfair value, and realized gains\nand losses. Net interest income\nearned from our trading\nactivities is reflected in the\ninterest income and interest\nexpense components of our\nconsolidated statement of\nincome. Changes in fair value\nand realized gains and losses\nof the financial instruments\nused in our trading activities\nare reflected in net gains from\ntrading activities. For\nadditional information on the\nfinancial instruments used in\nour trading activities and the\nincome from these trading\nactivities, see Note 2 (Trading\nActivities) to Financial\nStatements in this Report.\n\nValue-at-risk (VaR) is a\nstatistical risk measure used\nto estimate the potential loss\nfrom adverse moves in the\nfinancial markets, and Trading\nVaR is a measure used to\nprovide insight into the market\nrisk exhibited by the Company\u2019s\ntrading positions on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. The\nCompany uses these VaR metrics\ncomplemented with sensitivity\nanalysis and stress testing in\nmeasuring and monitoring market\nrisk. The Company calculates\nTrading VaR for risk management\npurposes to establish and\nmonitor line of business and\nCompany-wide risk limits.\nTrading VaR is calculated based\non all trading positions on our\nconsolidated balance sheet.\nTable 23 shows the Company\u2019s\nTrading General VaR by risk\ncategory.

The\ndiversification benefit is not\nmeaningful for low and high\nmetrics since they may occur on\ndifferent days.\n\nMARKET RISK \u2013 EQUITY\nSECURITIES. We are directly and\nindirectly affected by changes\nin the equity markets. We make\nand manage equity investments\nin various businesses, such as\nstart-up companies and emerging\ngrowth companies, some of which\nare made by our venture capital\nbusiness. We also invest in\nfunds that make similar private\nequity investments. For\nadditional information, see the\n\u201cRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability Management \u2013\nMarket Risk \u2013 Equity\nSecurities\u201d section in our 2024\nForm 10-K.\n\nAdditionally, as part of our\nbusiness to support our\ncustomers, we trade public\nequities, listed/over-the-\ncounter equity derivatives, and\nconvertible bonds. We have\nparameters that govern these\nactivities. For additional\ninformation on our equity\nsecurities, see Note 4 (Equity\nSecurities) to Financial\nStatements in this Report.\n\nChanges in equity market prices\nmay also indirectly affect our\nnet income by (1) the value of\nthird-party assets under\nmanagement and, hence, fee\nincome, (2) borrowers whose\nability to repay principal\nand/or interest may be affected\nby the stock market, or (3)\nbrokerage activity, related\ncommission income and other\nbusiness activities. Each\nbusiness line monitors and\nmanages these indirect risks.\n\nLIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING.\nLiquidity risk is the risk\narising from the inability of\nthe Company to meet obligations\nwhen they come due, or roll\nover funds at a reasonable\ncost, without incurring\nheightened costs. In the\nordinary course of business, we\nenter into contractual\nobligations that may require\nfuture cash payments, including\nfunding for customer loan\nrequests, customer deposit\nmaturities and withdrawals,\ndebt service, leases for\npremises and equipment, and\nother cash commitments.\nLiquidity risk also considers\nthe stability of deposits,\nincluding the risk of losing\nuninsured or non-operational\ndeposits. The objective of\neffective liquidity management\nis to be able to meet our\ncontractual obligations and\nother cash commitments\nefficiently under both normal\noperating conditions and under\nperiods of Wells Fargo-specific\nand/or market stress.\n\nTo help achieve this objective,\nthe Board establishes liquidity\nguidelines that require\nsufficient liquidity to cover\npotential funding requirements\nand to avoid over-dependence on\nvolatile, less reliable funding\nmarkets. These guidelines are\nmonitored on a monthly basis by\nthe management-level Corporate\nAsset/Liability Committee and\non a quarterly basis by the\nBoard. These guidelines are\nestablished and monitored for\nboth the Company and the Parent\non a stand-alone basis so that\nthe Parent is a source of\nstrength for its banking\nsubsidiaries. For additional\ninformation on liquidity risk\nand funding management, see the\n\u201cRisk Management \u2013 Liquidity\nRisk and Funding\u201d section in\nour 2024 Form 10-K.\n\nLiquidity Standards. We are\nsubject to a rule issued by the\nFRB, OCC and FDIC that\nestablishes a quantitative\nminimum liquidity requirement,\nknown as the liquidity coverage\nratio (LCR). The rule requires\na covered banking organization\nto hold high-quality liquid\nassets (HQLA) in an amount\nequal to or greater than its\nprojected net cash outflows\nduring a 30-day stress period.\nOur HQLA under the rule mainly\nconsists of central bank\ndeposits, government debt\nsecurities, and mortgage-backed\nsecurities of federal agencies.\nThe LCR applies to the Company\nand to our insured depository\ninstitutions (IDIs) with total\nassets of $10 billion or more.\nIn addition, rules issued by\nthe FRB impose enhanced\nliquidity risk management\nstandards on large bank holding\ncompanies (BHCs), such as Wells\nFargo.\n\nWe are also subject to a rule\nissued by the FRB, OCC and FDIC\nthat establishes a stable\nfunding requirement, known as\nthe net stable funding ratio\n(NSFR), which requires a\ncovered banking organization,\nsuch as Wells Fargo, to\nmaintain a minimum amount of\nstable funding, including\ncommon equity, long-term debt\nand most types of deposits, in\nrelation to its assets,\nderivative exposures and\ncommitments over a one-year\nhorizon period. The NSFR\napplies to the Company and to\nour IDIs with total assets of\n$10 billion or more. As of\nMarch 31, 2025, we were\ncompliant with the NSFR\nrequirement.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    37  \n                               \nRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability Management\n(continued)\n\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio.

As of March\n31, 2025, the Company had\napproximately $879.0 billion of\ntotal available liquidity\nsources.

Our high-quality liquid\ndebt securities presented in\nTable 25 are substantially the\nsame in composition as HQLA\neligible securities under the\nLCR rule; however, they will\ngenerally exceed HQLA eligible\nsecurities due to the\napplicable LCR haircuts and the\nexclusion of LCR adjustments\nfor excess liquidity that is\nnot transferable from certain\nsubsidiaries.\n\nWe believe our high-quality\nliquid debt securities provide\nreliable sources of liquidity\nthrough sales or by pledging to\nobtain financing, in both\nnormal and stressed market\nconditions. High-quality liquid\ndebt securities include AFS,\nHTM, and trading debt\nsecurities, as well as debt\nsecurities received through\nsecurities financing\nactivities.\n\nAs of March 31, 2025, we had\napproximately $595.2 billion of\nborrowing capacity at the\nFederal Reserve Discount Window\nand Federal Home Loan Banks\n(FHLB).

Our objective\nis to maintain capital at an\namount commensurate with our\nrisk profile and risk tolerance\nobjectives, and to meet both\nregulatory and market\nexpectations. We primarily fund\nour capital needs through the\nretention of earnings net of\nboth dividends and share\nrepurchases, as well as through\nthe issuance of preferred stock\nand long- and short-term debt.\nFor additional information\nabout capital planning, see the\n\u201cCapital Planning and Stress\nTesting\u201d section below.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Requirements                               \n                                                                \nThe Company and each of our\nIDIs are subject to various\nregulatory capital adequacy\nrequirements administered by\nthe FRB and the OCC. Risk-based\ncapital rules establish risk-\nadjusted ratios relating\nregulatory capital to different\ncategories of assets and off-\nbalance sheet exposures as\ndiscussed below.\n\nRISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-\nWEIGHTED ASSETS. The Company is\nsubject to rules issued by\nfederal banking regulators to\nimplement Basel III capital\nrequirements for U.S. banking\norganizations. The rules\ncontain two frameworks for\ncalculating capital\nrequirements, a Standardized\nApproach and an Advanced\nApproach applicable to certain\ninstitutions, including Wells\nFargo, and we must calculate\nour risk-based capital ratios\nunder both approaches. The\nCompany is required to satisfy\nthe risk-based capital ratio\nrequirements to avoid\nrestrictions on capital\ndistributions and discretionary\nbonus payments.\n\nIn July 2023, federal banking\nregulators issued a proposed\nrule to implement the final\ncomponents of Basel III, which\nwould impact risk-based capital\nrequirements for certain banks.\nThe proposed rule would\neliminate the current Advanced\nApproach and replace it with a\nnew expanded risk-based\napproach for the\n\nmeasurement of risk-weighted\nassets, including more granular\nrisk weights for credit risk, a\nnew market risk framework, and\na new standardized approach for\nmeasuring operational risk.\nOfficials from federal banking\nregulators have since commented\nthat there may be significant\nchanges to the proposed rule.\n\nTable 29 presents the risk-\nbased capital requirements\napplicable to the Company under\nthe Standardized Approach and\nAdvanced Approach,\nrespectively, as of March 31,\n2025.\n\nIn addition to the risk-based\ncapital requirements described\nin Table 29, if the FRB\ndetermines that a period of\nexcessive credit growth is\ncontributing to an increase in\nsystemic risk, a\ncountercyclical buffer of up to\n2.50% could be added to the\nrisk-based capital ratio\nrequirements under federal\nbanking regulations. The\ncountercyclical buffer in\neffect at March 31, 2025, was\n0.00%.\n\nThe capital conservation buffer\nis applicable to certain\ninstitutions, including Wells\nFargo, under the Advanced\nApproach and is intended to\nabsorb losses during times of\neconomic or financial stress.\n\nThe stress capital buffer is\ncalculated based on the\ndecrease in a BHC\u2019s risk-based\ncapital ratios under the\nseverely adverse scenario in\nthe FRB\u2019s annual supervisory\nstress test and related\nComprehensive Capital Analysis\nand Review (CCAR), plus four\nquarters of planned common\nstock dividends. Because the\nstress capital buffer is\ncalculated annually based on\ndata that can differ over time,\nour stress capital buffer, and\nthus our risk-based capital\nratio requirements under the\nStandardized Approach, are\nsubject to change in future\nperiods. Our stress capital\nbuffer for the period October\n1, 2024, through September 30,\n2025, is 3.80%. In April 2025,\nthe FRB proposed changes to the\nsupervisory stress test\nprocess.\n\nTable 29: Risk-Based Capital\nRequirements \u2013 Standardized and\nAdvanced Approaches\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    41  \n                               \n                                                                \n  Capital Management(continued)                                 \n                                                                \nAs a global systemically\nimportant bank (G-SIB), we are\nalso subject to the FRB\u2019s rule\nimplementing an additional\ncapital surcharge between\n1.00-4.50% on the risk-based\ncapital ratio requirements of\nG-SIBs. Under the rule, we must\nannually calculate our\nsurcharge under two methods and\nuse the higher of the two\nsurcharges. The first method\n(method one) considers our\nsize, interconnectedness,\ncross-jurisdictional activity,\nsubstitutability, and\ncomplexity, consistent with the\nmethodology developed by the\nBasel Committee on Banking\nSupervision (BCBS) and the\nFinancial Stability Board\n(FSB). The second method\n(method two) uses similar\ninputs, but replaces\nsubstitutability with use of\nshort-term wholesale funding\nand will generally result in\nhigher surcharges than under\nmethod one. Because the G-SIB\ncapital surcharge is calculated\nannually based on data that can\ndiffer over time, the amount of\nthe surcharge is subject to\nchange in future years. If our\nannual calculation results in a\ndecrease to our G-SIB capital\nsurcharge, the decrease takes\neffect the next calendar year.\nIf our annual calculation\nresults in an increase to our\nG-SIB capital surcharge, the\nincrease takes\n\neffect in two calendar years.\nOur G-SIB capital surcharge\nwill continue to be 1.50% in\n2025. On July 27, 2023, the FRB\nissued a proposed rule that\nwould impact the methodology\nused to calculate the G-SIB\ncapital surcharge.\n\nUnder the risk-based capital\nrules, on-balance sheet assets\nand credit equivalent amounts\nof derivatives and off-balance\nsheet items are assigned to one\nof several broad risk\ncategories according to the\nobligor, or, if relevant, the\nguarantor or the nature of any\ncollateral. The aggregate\ndollar amount in each risk\ncategory is then multiplied by\nthe risk weight associated with\nthat category. The resulting\nweighted values from each of\nthe risk categories are\naggregated for determining\ntotal risk-weighted assets\n(RWAs).\n\nThe tables that follow provide\ninformation about our risk-\nbased capital and related\nratios as calculated under\nBasel III capital rules.

difference between\nbook and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible\nassets at period-end.\n\n(2) Differences between the approaches are driven by the\nqualifying amounts of ACL

We also\nevaluate our business based on\ncertain ratios that utilize\ntangible common equity.\nTangible common equity is a\nnon-GAAP financial measure and\nrepresents total equity less\npreferred equity,\nnoncontrolling interests,\ngoodwill, certain identifiable\nintangible assets (other than\nMSRs) and goodwill and other\nintangibles on venture capital\ninvestments in consolidated\nportfolio companies, net of\napplicable deferred taxes. The\nratios are (i) tangible book\nvalue per common share, which\nrepresents tangible common\nequity divided by common shares\noutstanding; and (ii) return on\naverage tangible common equity\n(ROTCE), which represents our\n\nannualized earnings as a\npercentage of tangible common\nequity. The methodology of\ndetermining tangible common\nequity may differ among\ncompanies.

OTHER REGULATORY\nCAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MATTERS.\nFor information regarding the\nU.S. implementation of the\nBasel III LCR and NSFR, see the\n\u201cRisk Management \u2013 Asset/\nLiability Management \u2013\nLiquidity Risk and Funding \u2013\nLiquidity Standards\u201d section in\nthis Report. Our principal U.S.\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries,\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC,\nand Wells Fargo Clearing\nServices, LLC, are subject to\nregulations to maintain minimum\nnet capital requirements. As of\nMarch 31, 2025, these broker-\ndealer subsidiaries were in\ncompliance with their\nrespective regulatory minimum\nnet capital requirements.\nCapital Planning and Stress\nTesting Our planned long-term\ncapital structure is designed\nto meet regulatory and market\nexpectations. We believe that\nour long-term targeted capital\nstructure enables us to invest\nin and grow our business,\nsatisfy our customers\u2019\nfinancial needs in varying\nenvironments, access markets,\nand maintain flexibility to\nreturn capital to our\nshareholders. Our long-term\ntargeted capital structure also\nconsiders capital levels\nsufficient to exceed capital\nrequirements, including the\nG-SIB capital surcharge and the\nstress capital buffer, as well\nas potential changes to\nregulatory requirements for our\ncapital ratios, planned capital\nactions, changes in our risk\nprofile and other factors.\nAccordingly, our long-term\ntarget capital levels are set\nabove their respective\nregulatory minimums plus\nbuffers. During first quarter\n2025, we issued $558 million of\ncommon stock, substantially all\nof which was issued in\nconnection with employee\ncompensation and benefits, and\nwe repurchased 45 million\nshares of common stock at a\ncost of $3.5 billion. We paid\n$1.6 billion of common and\npreferred stock dividends\nduring first quarter 2025. The\nFRB capital plan rule\nestablishes capital planning\nand other requirements that\ngovern capital distributions,\nincluding dividends and share\nrepurchases, by certain BHCs,\nincluding Wells Fargo. The FRB\nassesses, among other things,\nthe overall financial\ncondition, risk profile, and\ncapital adequacy of BHCs when\nevaluating their capital plans.\n                               \n  46    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nAs part of the annual CCAR, the\nFRB generates a supervisory\nstress test. The FRB reviews\nthe supervisory stress test\nresults as required under the\nDodd-Frank Act using a common\nset of capital actions for all\nlarge BHCs and also reviews the\nCompany\u2019s proposed capital\nactions.\n\nFederal banking regulators also\nrequire large BHCs and banks to\nconduct their own stress tests\nto evaluate whether the\ninstitution has sufficient\ncapital to continue to operate\nduring periods of adverse\neconomic and financial\nconditions.\n                                                                \n  Securities Repurchases                                        \n                                                                \nOn July 25, 2023, we announced\nthat the Board authorized a\ncommon stock repurchase program\nof up to $30 billion. Unless\nmodified or revoked by the\nBoard, this authorization does\nnot expire. At March 31, 2025,\nwe had remaining Board\nauthority to repurchase up to\napproximately $3.8 billion of\ncommon stock. In addition, on\nApril 29, 2025, we announced\nthat the Board authorized the\nrepurchase of up to an\nadditional $40 billion of\ncommon stock.\n\nVarious factors impact the\namount and timing of our share\nrepurchases, including the\nearnings, cash requirements and\n\nfinancial condition of the\nCompany, the impact to our\nbalance sheet of expected\ncustomer activity, our capital\nrequirements and long-term\ntargeted capital structure, the\nresults of supervisory stress\ntests, market conditions\n(including the trading price of\nour stock), and regulatory and\nlegal considerations, including\nregulatory requirements under\nthe FRB\u2019s capital plan rule.\nAlthough we announce when the\nBoard authorizes a share\nrepurchase program, we\ntypically do not give any\npublic notice before we\nrepurchase our shares. Due to\nthe various factors that may\nimpact the amount and timing of\nour share repurchases and the\nfact that we may be in the\nmarket throughout the year, our\nshare repurchases occur at\nvarious prices. We may suspend\nshare repurchase activity at\nany time.\n\nFurthermore, the Company has a\nvariety of benefit plans in\nwhich employees may own or\nobtain shares of our common\nstock. The Company may buy\nshares from these plans to\naccommodate employee\npreferences and these purchases\nare subtracted from our\nrepurchase authority.\n\nFor additional information\nabout share repurchases during\nfirst quarter 2025, see Part\nII, Item 2 in this Report.\n                              \n  Regulation and Supervision  \n                              \nThe U.S. financial services\nindustry is subject to\nsignificant regulation and\nregulatory oversight\ninitiatives. This regulation\nand oversight may continue to\nimpact how U.S. financial\nservices companies conduct\nbusiness and may continue to\nresult in increased regulatory\ncompliance costs.\n\nThe following supplements our\ndiscussion of significant\nregulations and regulatory\noversight initiatives that have\naffected or may affect our\nbusiness contained in the\n\u201cRegulation and Supervision\u201d\nand \u201cRisk Factors\u201d sections in\nour 2024 Form 10-K.\n                                                                \n  Consent Orders and Other Regulatory Actions                   \n                                                                \nThe Company is subject to a\nnumber of consent orders and\nother regulatory actions, which\nmay require the Company, among\nother things, to undertake\ncertain changes to its\nbusiness, operations, products\nand services, and risk\nmanagement practices, and\ninclude the following.\n\nFederal Reserve Board Consent\nOrder Regarding Governance\nOversight and Compliance and\nOperational Risk Management. On\nFebruary 2, 2018, the Company\nentered into a consent order\nwith the Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System\n(FRB). As required by the\nconsent order, the Company\u2019s\nBoard of Directors (Board)\nsubmitted to the FRB a plan to\nfurther enhance the Board\u2019s\ngovernance and oversight of the\nCompany, and the Company\nsubmitted to the FRB a plan to\nfurther improve the Company\u2019s\ncompliance and operational risk\nmanagement program. The Company\ncontinues to engage with the\nFRB as the Company works to\naddress the consent order\nprovisions. The consent order\nalso requires the Company,\nfollowing the FRB\u2019s acceptance\nand approval of the plans and\nthe Company\u2019s adoption and\nimplementation of the plans, to\ncomplete an initial third-party\nreview of the enhancements and\nimprovements provided for in\nthe plans. Until this third-\nparty review is complete and\nthe plans are adopted and\nimplemented to the satisfaction\nof the FRB, the Company\u2019s total\nconsolidated assets as defined\nunder the consent order will be\nlimited to the level as of\n\nDecember 31, 2017. Compliance\nwith this asset cap is measured\non a two-quarter daily average\nbasis to allow for management\nof temporary fluctuations.\nAfter removal of the asset cap,\na second third-party review\nmust also be conducted to\nassess the efficacy and\nsustainability of the\nenhancements and improvements.\n\nConsent Order with the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau\nRegarding Compliance Risk\nManagement Program. On April\n20, 2018, the Company entered\ninto a consent order with the\nConsumer Financial Protection\nBureau (CFPB) requiring the\nCompany to enhance its\ncompliance risk management\nprogram and its management of\ncustomer remediation\nactivities. On April 28, 2025,\nthe Company announced the\nconsent order had terminated.\n\nConsent Order with the Office\nof the Comptroller of the\nCurrency Regarding Loss\nMitigation Activities. On\nSeptember 9, 2021, the Company\nentered into a consent order\nwith the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency\n(OCC) requiring the Company to\nimprove the execution, risk\nmanagement, and oversight of\nloss mitigation activities in\nits Home Lending business. On\nMarch 17, 2025, the Company\nannounced the OCC had\nterminated the consent order.\n\nFormal Agreement with the OCC\nRegarding Anti-Money Laundering\nand Sanctions Risk Management\nPractices. On September 12,\n2024, the Company announced\nthat Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\nentered into a formal agreement\nwith the OCC requiring the bank\nto enhance its anti-money\nlaundering and sanctions risk\nmanagement practices.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    47  \n                               \n                                \n  Critical Accounting Policies  \n                                \nOur significant accounting\npolicies are fundamental to\nunderstanding our results of\noperations and financial\ncondition because they require\nthat we use estimates and\nassumptions that may affect the\nvalue of our assets or\nliabilities and financial\nresults. Five of these policies\nare critical because they\nrequire management to make\ndifficult, subjective and\ncomplex judgments about matters\nthat are inherently uncertain\nand because it is likely that\nmaterially different amounts\nwould be reported under\ndifferent conditions or using\ndifferent assumptions. These\npolicies govern:\n\n\u2022 the allowance for credit\nlosses;\n\n\u2022 fair value measurements;\n\n\u2022 income taxes;\n\n\u2022 liability for legal actions;\nand\n\n\u2022 goodwill impairment.\n\nManagement has discussed these\ncritical accounting policies\nand the related estimates and\njudgments with the Board\u2019s\nAudit Committee.

We provide a\ndiversified set of banking,\ninvestment and mortgage\nproducts and services, as well\nas consumer and commercial\nfinance, to individuals,\nbusinesses and institutions\nthroughout the U.S., and in\ncountries outside the U.S. When\nwe refer to \u201cWells Fargo,\u201d \u201cthe\nCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus,\u201d\nwe mean Wells Fargo & Company\nand Subsidiaries\n(consolidated). Wells Fargo &\nCompany (the Parent) is a\nfinancial holding company and a\nbank holding company. Our\naccounting and reporting\npolicies conform with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting\nprinciples (GAAP) and practices\nin the financial services\nindustry. For a discussion of\nour significant accounting\npolicies, see Note 1 (Summary\nof Significant Accounting\nPolicies) in our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024 (2024 Form\n10-K). There were no material\nchanges to these policies in\nfirst quarter 2025. To prepare\nthe financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP,\nmanagement must make estimates\nbased on assumptions about\nfuture economic and market\nconditions (for example,\nunemployment, market liquidity,\nreal estate prices, etc.) that\naffect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities at the\ndate of the financial\nstatements, income and expenses\nduring the reporting period and\nthe related disclosures.\nAlthough our estimates\ncontemplate current conditions\nand how we expect them to\nchange in the future, it is\nreasonably possible that actual\nconditions could be worse than\nanticipated in those estimates,\nwhich could materially affect\nour results of operations and\nfinancial condition. Management\nhas made significant estimates\nin several areas, including: \u2022\nallowance for credit losses\n(Note 5 (Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit Losses)\nand Note 3 (Available-for-Sale\nand Held-to-Maturity Debt\nSecurities)); \u2022 fair value\nmeasurements (Note 6 (Mortgage\nBanking Activities) and Note 12\n(Fair Value Measurements)); \u2022\nliability for legal actions\n(Note 10 (Legal Actions)); \u2022\nincome taxes; and \u2022 goodwill\nimpairment (Note 7 (Intangible\nAssets and Other Assets)).\nActual results could differ\nfrom those estimates.\n\nThese unaudited interim\nfinancial statements reflect\nall adjustments that are, in\nthe opinion of management,\nnecessary for a fair statement\nof the results for the periods\npresented. These adjustments\nare of a normal recurring\nnature, unless otherwise\ndisclosed in this Form 10-Q.\nThe results of operations in\nthe interim financial\nstatements do not necessarily\nindicate the results that may\nbe expected for the full year.\nThe interim financial\ninformation should be read in\nconjunction with our 2024 Form\n10-K.

The credit quality indicators that we most closely\nmonitor include credit ratings and delinquency status and are\nbased on information as of our financial statement date. CREDIT\nRATINGS. Credit ratings express opinions about the credit\nquality of a debt security. We determine the credit rating of a\nsecurity according to the lowest credit rating made available by\nnational recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs).\nDebt securities rated investment grade, that is those with\nratings similar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as defined by NRSROs, are\ngenerally considered by the rating agencies and market\nparticipants to be low credit risk. Conversely, debt securities\nrated below investment grade, labeled as \u201cspeculative grade\u201d by\nthe rating agencies, are considered to be distinctively higher\ncredit risk than investment grade debt securities. For debt\nsecurities not rated by NRSROs, we determine an internal credit\ngrade of the debt securities (used for credit risk management\npurposes) equivalent to the credit ratings assigned by major\ncredit agencies. Substantially all of our debt securities were\nrated by NRSROs at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024.

Debt security\nissuers that are delinquent in payment of amounts due under\ncontractual debt agreements have a higher probability of\nrecognition of credit losses. As such, as part of our monitoring\nof the credit quality of the debt security portfolio, we\nconsider whether debt securities we own are past due in payment\nof principal or interest payments and whether any securities\nhave been placed into nonaccrual status. Debt securities that\nare past due and still accruing or in nonaccrual status were\ninsignificant at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024. Net\ncharge-offs on debt securities were insignificant in the first\nquarter of both 2025 and 2024.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    63  \n                               \nNote 3: Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities\n(continued)\n\nUnrealized Losses of Available-for-Sale Debt Securities\nTable 3.5 shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of\nAFS debt securities by length of time those individual\nsecurities in each category have been in a continuous loss\nposition.

impairment. As part of\nthat assessment we evaluated and concluded that we do not intend\nto sell any of the debt securities, and that it is more likely\nthan not that we will not be required to sell, prior to recovery\nof the amortized cost basis. We evaluate, where necessary,\nwhether credit impairment exists by comparing the present value\nof the expected cash flows to the debt securities\u2019 amortized\ncost basis. Credit impairment is recorded as an ACL for debt\nsecurities. For descriptions of the factors we consider when\nanalyzing debt securities for impairment as well as methodology\nand significant inputs used to measure credit losses, see Note 1\n(Summary of

We also\noriginate multipurpose lending\ncommitments under which\ncommercial customers have the\noption to draw on the facility\nin one of several forms,\nincluding the issuance of\nletters of credit, which\nreduces the unfunded commitment\namounts of the facility. The\nmaximum credit risk for these\ncommitments will generally be\nlower than the contractual\namount because these\ncommitments may expire without\nbeing used or may be cancelled\nat the customer\u2019s request. We\nmay reduce or cancel lines of\ncredit in accordance with the\ncontracts and applicable law.\nOur credit risk monitoring\nactivities include managing the\namount of commitments, both to\nindividual customers and in\ntotal, and the size and\nmaturity structure of these\ncommitments. We do not\nrecognize an ACL for\ncommitments that are\nunconditionally cancellable at\nour discretion. We issue\ncommercial letters of credit to\nassist customers in purchasing\ngoods or services, typically\nfor international trade.

evaluation of the\nappropriateness of the ACL for loans. The following sections\nprovide the credit quality indicators we most closely monitor.\nThe credit quality indicators are generally based on information\nas of our financial statement date. COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY\nINDICATORS. We manage a consistent process for assessing\ncommercial loan credit quality. Commercial loans are generally\nsubject to individual risk assessment using our internal\nborrower and collateral quality ratings, which is our primary\ncredit quality indicator. Our ratings are aligned to regulatory\ndefinitions of pass and criticized categories with the\ncriticized segmented among special mention, substandard,\ndoubtful, and loss categories. Table 5.7 provides the\noutstanding balances of our commercial loan portfolio by risk\ncategory and credit quality information by origination year for\nterm loans. Revolving loans may convert to term loans as a\nresult of a contractual provision in the original loan agreement\nor if modified for a borrower experiencing financial difficulty.\nAt March 31, 2025, we had $ 506.1billion and $ 34.6billion of\npass and criticized commercial loans, respectively. Gross\ncharge-offs by loan class are included in the following table\nfor the quarter ended March 31, 2025, and year ended December\n31, 2024, which we monitor as part of our credit risk management\npractices; however, charge-offs are not a primary credit quality\nindicator for our loan portfolio.\n                               \n  72    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 5.7: Commercial Loan Categories by Risk Categories and\nVintage\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                               1      2      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                                                                \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                               5      \u2026      \u2014      \u2014      \u2026    \n                                                                \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2014      \u2026    \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2014      \u2026    \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2014      \u2026    \n                               2      1      \u2014      \u2014      \u2026    \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                               8      7      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                                                                \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2014      \u2026    \n                                                                \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2014      \u2026    \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2014      \u2026    \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2014      \u2026    \n                               5      3      \u2014      \u2014      \u2026    \n                               \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                \n(1) Includes charge-offs on overdrafts, which are generally\ncharged-off at 60 days past due.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    73  \n                               \nNote 5: Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses\n(continued)\nTable 5.8 provides days past due (DPD) information for\ncommercial loans, which we monitor as part of our credit risk\nmanagement practices;

We have various classes of\nconsumer loans that present unique credit risks. Loan\ndelinquency, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and\nloan-to-value (LTV) for residential mortgage loans are the\nprimary credit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in\nour evaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL for the\nconsumer loan portfolio segment. Many of our loss estimation\ntechniques used for the ACL for loans rely on delinquency-based\nmodels; therefore, delinquency is an important indicator of\ncredit quality in the establishment of our ACL for consumer\nloans. We obtain FICO scores at loan origination and the scores\nare generally updated at least quarterly, except in limited\ncircumstances, including compliance with the Fair Credit\nReporting Act (FCRA). FICO scores are not available for certain\nloan types or may not be required if we deem it unnecessary due\nto strong collateral and other borrower attributes. LTV is the\nratio of the outstanding loan balance divided by the property\ncollateral value. For junior lien mortgages, we use the total\ncombined loan balance of first and junior lien mortgages\n(including unused line of credit amounts). We obtain LTVs using\na cascade approach which first uses values provided by automated\nvaluation models (AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not\navailable, then the value is estimated using the original\nappraised value adjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI)\nfor the property location. If an HPI is not available, the\noriginal appraised value is used. The HPI value is normally the\nonly method considered for high value properties, generally with\nan original value of $ 1.5million or more, as the AVM values\nhave proven less accurate for these properties. Generally, we\nupdate LTVs on a quarterly basis. Certain loans do not have an\nLTV due to a lack of industry data availability and portfolios\nacquired from or serviced by other institutions. Gross charge-\noffs by loan class are included in the following tables for the\nquarter ended March 31, 2025, and year ended December 31, 2024,\nwhich we monitor as part of our credit risk management\npractices; however, charge-offs are not a primary credit quality\nindicator for our loan portfolio. Credit quality information is\nprovided with the year of origination for term loans. Revolving\nloans may convert to term loans as a result of a contractual\nprovision in the original loan agreement or if modified for a\nborrower experiencing financial difficulty.

Foreclosure\nprocedures and timelines vary\ndepending on whether the\nproperty address resides in a\njudicial or non-judicial state.\nJudicial states require the\nforeclosure to be processed\nthrough the state\u2019s courts\nwhile non-judicial states are\nprocessed without court\nintervention. Foreclosure\ntimelines vary according to\nstate law.\n\nLOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE\nAND STILL ACCRUING.

and\ncaution should be exercised when relying on this data. Changes\nin value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be\nextrapolated because the relationship of the change in the\nassumption to the change in value may not be linear. Also, the\neffect of a variation in a particular assumption on the value of\nthe other interests held is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumptions. In reality, changes in one\nfactor may result in changes in others, which might magnify or\ncounteract the sensitivities. We present information for our\nmanaged servicing portfolio in Table 6.3 using unpaid principal\nbalance for loans serviced and subserviced for others and\ncarrying value for owned loans serviced. As the servicer of\nloans for others, we advance certain payments of principal,\ninterest, taxes, insurance, and default-related expenses. The\ncredit risk related to these advances is limited since the\nreimbursement is generally senior to cash payments to investors\nand are generally reimbursed within a short timeframe from cash\nflows from the trust, government-sponsored enterprise (GSEs),\ninsurer, or borrower. We maintain an allowance for uncollectible\namounts for advances on loans serviced for others that may not\nbe reimbursed if the payments were not made in accordance with\napplicable servicing agreements or if the insurance or servicing\nagreements contain limitations on reimbursements. We also\nadvance payments of taxes and insurance for our owned loans\nwhich are collectible from the borrower. Servicer advances on\nowned loans are written-off when deemed uncollectible.\n\nTable 6.3: Managed Servicing Portfolio\n                                                                \n

These proceedings\nand investigations include actions brought against Wells Fargo\nand/or our subsidiaries with respect to corporate-related\nmatters and transactions in which Wells Fargo and/or our\nsubsidiaries were involved. In addition, Wells Fargo and our\nsubsidiaries may be requested to provide information to or\notherwise cooperate with government authorities in the conduct\nof investigations of other persons or industry groups. We\nestablish accruals for legal actions when potential losses\nassociated with the actions become probable and the costs can be\nreasonably estimated. For such accruals, we record the amount we\nconsider to be the best estimate within a range of potential\nlosses that are both probable and estimable; however, if we\ncannot determine a best estimate, then we record the low end of\nthe range of those potential losses. There can be no assurance\nas to the ultimate outcome of legal actions, including the\nmatters described below, and the actual costs of resolving legal\nactions may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts\naccrued for those actions. ADVISORY ACCOUNT CASH SWEEP\nLITIGATION. Putative class actions have been filed in federal\ndistrict courts alleging that the Company breached its fiduciary\nduties or agreements with regard to rates paid to investment\nadvisory clients in its cash sweep program. These actions have\nbeen consolidated in the United States District Court for the\nNorthern District of California. ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND\nECONOMIC SANCTIONS RELATED INVESTIGATIONS. Government\nauthorities are conducting inquiries or investigations regarding\nissues related to the Company\u2019s anti-money laundering and\nsanctions programs. On September 12, 2024, the Company announced\nthat Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. entered into a formal agreement with\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) related to\nthe bank\u2019s anti-money laundering and sanctions risk management\npractices. COMPANY 401(K) PLAN LITIGATION. On September 26,\n2022, participants in the Company\u2019s 401(k) plan filed a putative\nclass action in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Minnesota alleging that the Company violated the\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 in connection\nwith certain transactions associated with the Employee Stock\nOwnership Plan feature of the Company\u2019s 401(k) plan, including\nthe manner in which the 401(k) plan purchased certain securities\nused in connection with the Company\u2019s contributions to the\n401(k) plan. HIRING PRACTICES MATTERS. Government agencies,\nincluding the United States Department of Justice and the United\nStates Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have undertaken\nformal or informal inquiries or investigations regarding the\nCompany\u2019s hiring practices related to diversity. The United\nStates Department of Justice and the SEC have since closed their\ninvestigations without taking action. A putative securities\nfraud class action has also been filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California alleging\nthat the Company and certain of its executive officers made\nfalse or misleading statements about the Company\u2019s hiring\npractices related to diversity. Allegations related to the\nCompany\u2019s hiring practices related to diversity are also among\nthe subjects of a shareholder derivative lawsuit pending in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia. HOME MORTGAGE DISCRIMINATION LITIGATION. Plaintiffs\nrepresenting a class of home mortgage applicants and customers\nfiled putative class actions against Wells Fargo alleging that\nWells Fargo\u2019s mortgage lending policies and practices resulted\nin disparate treatment and disparate impact against minority\napplicants. These actions have been consolidated in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California.\nINTERCHANGE LITIGATION. Plaintiffs representing a class of\nmerchants have filed putative class actions, and individual\nmerchants have filed individual actions, alleging that Visa and\nMastercard, as well as certain payment card issuing banks\nincluding Wells Fargo, unlawfully colluded to set interchange\nrates associated with Visa and Mastercard payment card\ntransactions and that enforcement of certain Visa and Mastercard\nrules and alleged tying and bundling of services offered to\nmerchants were anticompetitive. These actions have been\nconsolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York. Wells Fargo, along with other defendants\nand entities, are parties to loss and judgment sharing\nagreements, which provide that they, along with other entities,\nwill share, based on a formula, in any losses or judgments from\nthe relevant litigation. In July 2012, Visa, Mastercard, and the\nfinancial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, agreed\nto pay a total of approximately $ 6.6billion in order to settle\nthe consolidated action. Several merchants opted out of the\nsettlement and are pursuing individual actions. In June 2016,\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nvacated the settlement agreement and reversed and remanded the\nconsolidated action to the district court for further\nproceedings. In November 2016, the district court appointed lead\nclass counsel for a damages class and an equitable relief class.\nThe parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the\ndamages class claims pursuant to which defendants agreed to pay\na total of approximately $ 6.2billion, which includes\napproximately $ 5.3billion of funds remaining in escrow from the\n2012 settlement and $ 900million in additional funding. Wells\nFargo\u2019s allocated responsibility for the additional funding is\napproximately $ 94.5million. The court granted final approval of\nthe settlement on December 13, 2019, which was affirmed by the\nSecond Circuit on March 15, 2023. On September 27, 2021, the\ndistrict court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class\ncertification in the equitable relief case. On March 26, 2024,\nVisa and Mastercard entered into a settlement agreement to\nresolve the equitable relief class claims, which was denied by\nthe district court on June 25, 2024. Some of the opt-out and\ndirect-action cases have been settled while others remain\npending. SEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION. The Seminole Tribe\nof Florida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging\nthat Wells Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection\nwith the administration of a minor\u2019s trust and failed to invest\nthe assets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later\namended to include threeindividual current and former\nbeneficiaries as plaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party\nto the case. In March 2025, a trial verdict was entered against\nWells Fargo. If post-trial motions are denied, Wells Fargo plans\nto appeal.\n                               \n  88    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nZELLE LITIGATION. On December\n20, 2024, the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau\n(CFPB) filed a complaint in the\nUnited States District Court\nfor the District of Arizona\nagainst multiple financial\nservices companies, including\nWells Fargo, regarding fund\ntransfers made through the\nZelle Network. On March 4,\n2025, the CFPB dismissed its\nlawsuit with prejudice.\nOUTLOOK. As described above,\nthe Company establishes\naccruals for legal actions when\npotential losses associated\nwith the actions become\nprobable and the costs can be\nreasonably estimated. The high\nend of the range of reasonably\npossible losses in excess of\nthe Company\u2019s accrual for\nprobable and estimable losses\nwas approximately $ 2.0billion\nas of March 31, 2025. The\noutcomes of legal actions are\nunpredictable and subject to\nsignificant uncertainties, and\nit is inherently difficult to\ndetermine whether any loss is\nprobable or even possible. It\nis also inherently difficult to\nestimate the amount of any loss\nand there may be matters for\nwhich a loss is probable or\nreasonably possible but not\ncurrently estimable.\nAccordingly, actual losses may\nbe in excess of the established\naccrual or the range of\nreasonably possible loss. Based\non information currently\navailable, advice of counsel,\navailable insurance coverage,\nand established reserves, Wells\nFargo believes that the\neventual outcome of the actions\nagainst Wells Fargo and/or its\nsubsidiaries will not,\nindividually or in the\naggregate, have a material\nadverse effect on Wells Fargo\u2019s\nconsolidated financial\ncondition. However, it is\npossible that the ultimate\nresolution of a matter, if\nunfavorable, may be material to\nWells Fargo\u2019s results of\noperations for any particular\nperiod.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    89  \n                               \n                       \n  Note 11:Derivatives  \n                       \nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including\ninterest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and\nto assist customers with their risk management objectives. We\ndesignate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in\nqualifying hedge accounting relationships (fair value or cash\nflow hedges). Our remaining derivatives consist of economic\nhedges that do not qualify for, or we have elected not to apply,\nhedge accounting and derivatives held for customer accommodation\ntrading purposes.

Derivative transactions can\nbe measured in terms of the notional amount, but this amount is\nnot recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and is not, when\nviewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of\nthe instruments. The notional amount is generally not exchanged,\nbut is used only as the basis on which derivative cash flows are\ndetermined.\nTable 11.1: Notional or Contractual Amounts and Fair Values of\nDerivatives\n                                                                \n                                    \u2026                       D\u2026  \n                                    \u2026                       3\u2026  \n                                    \u2026                       2\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n            \u2026                               \u2026                   \n            \u2026                       \u2026       \u2026               F\u2026  \n            \u2026                       \u2026       \u2026               v\u2026  \n            \u2026                               \u2026                   \n                 \u2026          \u2026               \u2026       \u2026           \n                 \u2026          \u2026               \u2026       \u2026           \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      $  \u2026             \u2026         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \n         \u2026             4         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \n         \u2026             \u2026         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \n                       \u2026         \u2026               \u2026       \u2026      \n                                                                \n         \u2026             \u2026         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \n         \u2026             \u2026         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \n         \u2026             \u2026         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \n         \u2026             \u2026         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \n         \u2026             \u2026         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \n                       \u2026         \u2026               \u2026       \u2026      \n                       \u2026         \u2026               \u2026       \u2026      \n                       \u2026         \u2026               \u2026       \u2026      \n                    $  \u2026         \u2026               \u2026       \u2026      \n                                                                \nBalance Sheet Offsetting\nWe execute substantially all of our derivative transactions\nunder master netting arrangements. When legally enforceable,\nthese master netting arrangements give the ability, in the event\nof default by the counterparty, to liquidate securities held as\ncollateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same\ncounterparty. We reflect all derivative balances and related\ncash collateral subject to legally enforceable master netting\narrangements on a net basis on our consolidated balance sheet.\nWe do not net non-cash collateral that we receive or pledge\nagainst derivative balances on our consolidated balance sheet.\nFor disclosure purposes, we present \u201cTotal derivatives, net\u201d\nwhich represents the aggregate of our net exposure to each\ncounterparty after considering the balance sheet netting\nadjustments and any non-cash collateral. We manage derivative\nexposure by monitoring the credit risk associated with each\ncounterparty using counterparty-specific credit risk limits,\nusing master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral.\nTable 11.2 provides information on the fair values of derivative\nassets and liabilities subject to legally enforceable master\nnetting arrangements with the same counterparty, the balance\nsheet netting adjustments and the resulting net fair value\namount recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as\nthe non-cash collateral associated with such arrangements. In\naddition to the netting amounts included in the table, we also\nhave balance sheet netting related to resale and repurchase\nagreements that are disclosed within Note 15 (Securities\nFinancing Activities).\n                               \n  90    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 11.2: Offsetting of Derivative Assets and Liabilities\n

These valuation adjustments were\nprimarily related to interest rate and foreign exchange\ncontracts. Table 11.7 and Table 11.8 present information related\nto derivative valuation adjustments.\n\nFair Value and Cash Flow Hedges\n\nFor fair value hedges, we use interest rate swaps to convert\ncertain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and time certificates\nof deposit to floating rates to hedge our exposure to interest\nrate risk. We also enter into cross-currency swaps, cross-\ncurrency interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our\nexposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk\nassociated with the issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated\nlong-term debt. We also enter into futures contracts, forward\ncontracts, and swap contracts to hedge our exposure to the price\nrisk of physical commodities included in other assets on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. In addition, we use interest rate\nswaps, cross-currency swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps\nand forward contracts to hedge against changes in fair value of\ncertain investments in AFS debt securities due to changes in\ninterest rates, foreign currency rates, or both. For certain\nfair value hedges of interest rate risk, we use the portfolio\nlayer method to hedge stated amounts of closed portfolios of AFS\ndebt securities. For certain fair value hedges of foreign\ncurrency risk, changes in fair value of cross-currency swaps\nattributable to changes in cross-currency basis spreads are\nexcluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded\nin other comprehensive income (OCI). See Note 21 (Other\nComprehensive Income) for the amounts recognized in other\ncomprehensive income. For cash flow hedges, we use interest rate\nswaps to hedge the variability in interest payments received on\ncertain interest-earning deposits with banks and certain\nfloating-rate commercial loans. We also use cross-currency swaps\nto hedge variability in interest payments on fixed-rate foreign\ncurrency-denominated long-term debt due to changes in foreign\nexchange rates. We estimate $ 451million pre-tax of deferred net\nlosses related to cash flow hedges in OCI at March 31, 2025,\nwill be reclassified into net interest income during the next\ntwelve months. For cash flow hedges as of March 31, 2025, we are\nhedging our interest rate and foreign currency exposure to the\nvariability of future cash flows for all forecasted transactions\nfor a maximum of approximately 7years. For additional\ninformation on our accounting hedges, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) in our 2024 Form 10-K.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    91

For additional\ninformation on other derivatives, see Note 14 (Derivatives) in\nour 2024 Form 10-K. Table 11.6 shows the net gains (losses)\nrelated to economic hedge derivatives. Gains (losses) on\ncustomer accommodation trading derivatives are excluded from\nTable 11.6.

We generally use\ncredit derivatives to assist\ncustomers with their risk\nmanagement objectives by\npurchasing and selling credit\nprotection on corporate debt\nobligations through the use of\ncredit default swaps or through\nrisk participation swaps to\nhelp manage counterparty\nexposure. We would be required\nto perform under the credit\nderivatives we sold in the\nevent of default by the\nreferenced obligors.

Table 11.10\nillustrates our exposure to OTC\nbilateral derivative contracts\nwith credit-risk contingent\nfeatures, collateral we have\nposted, and the additional\ncollateral we would be required\nto post if the credit rating of\nour debt was downgraded below\ninvestment grade.\n\nTable 11.10: Credit-Risk\nContingent Features\n                                                                \n                                      Mar 31,          Dec 31,  \n  (in billions)                       2025             2024     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Net derivative                                                \n  liabilities with           $  24.3             23.8           \n  credit-risk contingent                                        \n  features                                                      \n  Collateral posted             21.6             19.8           \n  Additional collateral                                         \n  to be posted upon                                             \n  a below investment             2.7              4.1           \n  grade credit rating                                           \n  (1)                                                           \n                                                                \n(1) Any credit rating below\ninvestment grade requires us to\npost the maximum amount of\ncollateral.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    95  \n                               \n                                   \n  Note 12:Fair Value Measurements  \n                                   \nWe use fair value measurements\nto record fair value\nadjustments to certain assets\nand liabilities and to fulfill\nfair value disclosure\nrequirements. Assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis,\nsuch as derivatives,\nresidential MSRs, and trading\nor AFS debt securities, are\npresented in Table 12.1 in this\nNote. Additionally, from time\nto time, we record fair value\nadjustments on a nonrecurring\nbasis. These nonrecurring\nadjustments typically involve\napplication of an accounting\nmethod such as lower of cost or\nfair value (LOCOM) and the\nmeasurement alternative, or\nwrite-downs of individual\nassets. Assets recorded at fair\nvalue on a nonrecurring basis\nare presented in Table 12.4 in\nthis Note. We provide in Table\n12.9 estimates of fair value\nfor financial instruments that\nare not recorded at fair value,\nsuch as loans and debt\nliabilities carried at\namortized cost. See Note 1\n(Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) in our\n2024 Form 10-K for a discussion\nof how we determine fair value.\nFor descriptions of the\nvaluation methodologies we use\nfor assets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value on a\nrecurring or nonrecurring\nbasis, see Note 15 (Fair Value\nMeasurements) in our 2024 Form\n10-K.\n\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY We\nclassify our assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair\nvalue as either Level 1, 2, or\n3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe highest priority (Level 1)\nis assigned to valuations based\non unadjusted quoted prices in\nactive markets and the lowest\npriority (Level 3) is assigned\nto valuations that include one\nor more significant\nunobservable inputs. See Note 1\n(Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) in our\n2024 Form 10-K for a detailed\ndescription of the fair value\nhierarchy. In the determination\nof the classification of\nfinancial instruments in Level\n2 or Level 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy, we consider all\navailable information,\nincluding observable market\ndata, indications of market\nliquidity and orderliness of\ntransactions, and our\nunderstanding of the valuation\ntechniques and significant\ninputs used. This determination\nis ultimately based upon the\nspecific facts and\ncircumstances of each\ninstrument or instrument\ncategory and judgments are made\nregarding the significance of\nthe unobservable inputs to the\ninstruments\u2019 fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety. If\none or more unobservable inputs\nis considered significant, the\ninstrument is classified as\nLevel 3. We do not classify\nnonmarketable equity securities\nin the fair value hierarchy if\nwe use the non-published net\nasset value (NAV) per share (or\nits equivalent) as a practical\nexpedient to measure fair\nvalue. Marketable equity\nsecurities with published NAVs\nare classified in the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\n                               \n  96    Wells Fargo & Company  \n

\n  Entities                                       \n                                                 \nInvolvement with Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various types of\non- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose\nentities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited\nliability companies or partnerships that are established for a\nlimited purpose. SPEs are often formed in connection with\nsecuritization transactions whereby financial assets are\ntransferred to an SPE. SPEs formed in connection with\nsecuritization transactions are generally considered variable\ninterest entities (VIEs). The VIE may alter the risk profile of\nthe asset by entering into derivative transactions or obtaining\ncredit support, and issues various forms of interests in those\nassets to investors. When we transfer financial assets from our\nconsolidated balance sheet to a VIE in connection with a\nsecuritization, we typically receive cash and sometimes other\ninterests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets we transfer. In\ncertain transactions with VIEs, we may retain the right to\nservice the transferred assets and repurchase the transferred\nassets if the outstanding balance of the assets falls below the\nlevel at which the cost to service the assets exceed the\nbenefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service\nloans transferred to a VIE by a third party. In connection with\nour securitization or other VIE activities, we have various\nforms of ongoing involvement with VIEs, which may include: \u2022\nunderwriting securities issued by VIEs and subsequently making\nmarkets in those securities; \u2022 providing credit enhancement on\nsecurities issued by VIEs through the use of letters of credit\nor financial guarantees; \u2022 entering into other derivative\ncontracts with VIEs; \u2022 holding senior or subordinated interests\nin VIEs; \u2022 acting as servicer or investment manager for VIEs; \u2022\nproviding administrative or trustee services to VIEs; and \u2022\nproviding seller financing to VIEs. Loan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity We periodically transfer consumer and\ncommercial loans and other types of financial assets in\nsecuritization and whole loan sale transactions. MORTGAGE LOANS\nSOLD TO GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTERPRISES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH\nGINNIE MAE. In the normal course of business we sell residential\nand commercial mortgage loans to GSEs. These loans are generally\ntransferred into securitizations sponsored by the GSEs, which\nprovide certain credit guarantees to investors and servicers. We\nalso transfer mortgage loans into securitization pools pursuant\nto Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) guidelines\nwhich are insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Mortgage\nloans eligible for securitization with the GSEs or GNMA are\nconsidered conforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA design the\nstructure of these securitizations, sponsor the involved VIEs,\nand have power over the activities most significant to the VIE.\nWe account for loans transferred in conforming mortgage loan\nsecuritization transactions as sales and do not consolidate the\nVIEs as we are not the primary beneficiary. In exchange for the\ntransfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by the\nVIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for\ninvestment purposes as HTM or AFS securities. We also retain\nservicing rights on the transferred loans. As a servicer, we\nretain the option to repurchase loans from certain loan\nsecuritizations, which becomes exercisable based on delinquency\nstatus such as when three scheduled loan payments are past due.\nWhen we have the unilateral option to repurchase a loan, we\nrecognize the loan and a corresponding liability on our balance\nsheet regardless of our intent to repurchase the loan, and the\nloans remain pledged to the securitization. At both March 31,\n2025, and December 31, 2024, we recorded assets and related\nliabilities of $ 1.5billion, where we did not exercise our\noption to repurchase eligible loans. We repurchased loans of $\n97million and $ 90million during the first quarter of 2025 and\n2024, respectively. Upon transfers of loans, we also provide\nindemnification for losses incurred due to material breaches of\ncontractual representations and warranties as well as other\nrecourse arrangements. At March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024,\nour liability for these repurchase and recourse arrangements was\n$ 189million and $ 188million, respectively, and the maximum\nexposure to loss was $ 13.5billion and $ 13.7billion at March\n31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively. Substantially all\nresidential servicing activity is related to assets transferred\nto GSE and GNMA securitizations. See Note 6 (Mortgage Banking\nActivities) for additional information about residential and\ncommercial servicing rights, advances and servicing fees.\nNONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS. In the normal\ncourse of business, we sell nonconforming mortgage loans in\nsecuritization transactions that we design and sponsor.\nNonconforming mortgage loan securitizations do not involve a\ngovernment credit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial\ninterest holders are subject to credit risk of the underlying\nassets held by the securitization VIE. We typically originate\nthe transferred loans and account for the transfers as sales. We\nalso typically retain the right to service the loans and may\nhold other beneficial interests issued by the VIE, such as debt\nsecurities held for investment purposes. We do not consolidate\nthe VIE because the most significant decisions impacting the\nperformance of the VIE are generally made by the special\nservicer or the controlling class security holder. For our\nresidential nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations\naccounted for as sales, we either do not hold variable interests\nthat we consider potentially significant or are not the primary\nservicer for a majority of the VIE assets. WHOLE LOAN SALE\nTRANSACTIONS. We may also sell whole loans to VIEs where we have\ncontinuing involvement in the form of financing. We account for\nthese transfers as sales, and do not consolidate the VIEs as we\ndo not have the power to direct the most significant activities\nof the VIEs. Table 13.1 presents information about transfers of\nassets during the periods presented for which we recorded the\ntransfers as sales and have continuing involvement with the\ntransferred assets. In connection with these transfers, we\nreceived proceeds and recorded servicing assets and securities.\nEach of these interests are initially measured at fair value.\nServicing rights are classified as Level 3 measurements, and\ngenerally securities are classified as Level 2. Transfers of\nresidential mortgage loans are transactions with the GSEs or\nGNMA and generally result in nogain or loss because the loans\nare typically measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nTransfers of commercial mortgage loans\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    103  \n                                \nNote 13: Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities\n(continued)\n\ninclude both transactions with the GSEs or GNMA and\nnonconforming transactions. These commercial mortgage loans are\ncarried at the lower of cost or market, and we recognize gains\non such transfers when the market value is greater than the\ncarrying value of the loan when it is sold.\n\nTable 13.1: Transfers with Continuing Involvement\n                                                                \n  (in                                                           \n  mi\u2026                                                           \n  Qu\u2026                          2025                       2024  \n  en\u2026                          Com\u2026                       Com\u2026  \n  Ma\u2026             Res\u2026         mor\u2026          Res\u2026         mor\u2026  \n  31,             mor\u2026         (1)           mor\u2026         (1)   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  As\u2026    $  1,8\u2026          675          1,6\u2026          1,\u2026        \n  so\u2026                                                           \n  Pr\u2026                                                           \n  fr\u2026       1,8\u2026          686          1,6\u2026          1,\u2026        \n  tr\u2026                                                           \n  (2)                                                           \n  Net                                                           \n  ga\u2026                                                           \n  (l\u2026          \u2014           11             \u2014           21        \n  on                                                            \n  sa\u2026                                                           \n  Co\u2026                                                           \n  in\u2026                                                           \n  (3\u2026                                                           \n  Se\u2026                                                           \n  ri\u2026    $    24           11            16           10        \n  re\u2026                                                           \n  Se\u2026                                                           \n  re\u2026          \u2014            \u2014             \u2014            \u2014        \n  (4)                                                           \n                                                                \n(1) In first quarter 2025, we\nsold the non-agency portion of\nour commercial mortgage third-\nparty servicing business.\n\n(2) Represents cash proceeds\nand the fair value of non-cash\nbeneficial interests recognized\nat securitization settlement.\n\n(3) Represents assets or\nliabilities recognized at\nsecuritization settlement date\nrelated to our continuing\ninvolvement in the transferred\nassets.\n\n(4) Represents debt securities\nobtained at securitization\nsettlement held for investment\npurposes that are classified as\navailable-for-sale or held-to-\nmaturity.

We may also provide\nseller financing in the form of\nloans. During the quarters\nended March 31, 2025 and 2024,\nfor VIEs with significant\ncontinuing involvement, we\nreceived cash flows of $\n6million and $ 158million,\nrespectively, related to\nprincipal and interest payments\non these securities and loans.\nThese amounts exclude cash\nflows related to trading\nactivities.\nTable 13.2 presents the key\nweighted-average assumptions we\nused to initially measure\nresidential MSRs recognized\nduring the periods presented.\nTable 13.2: Residential MSRs \u2013\nAssumptions at Securitization\nDate\n                                                               \n  Quarter ended March 31,                  2025          2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Prepayment rate (1)                14.3  %       17.3        \n  Discount rate                      10.4          10.3        \n  Cost to service ($ per loan)    $    62           265        \n                                                               \n(1) Includes a blend of\nprepayment speeds and expected\ndefaults. Prepayment speeds are\ninfluenced by mortgage interest\nrates as well as our estimation\nof drivers of borrower\nbehavior.\nSee Note 12 (Fair Value Measurements) and Note 6 (Mortgage\nBanking Activities) for additional information on key\nassumptions for residential MSRs.\n\nRESECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES. We enter into resecuritization\ntransactions as part of our trading activities to accommodate\nthe investment and risk management activities of our customers.\nIn resecuritization transactions, we transfer trading debt\nsecurities to VIEs in exchange for new beneficial interests that\nare sold to third parties at or shortly after securitization\nsettlement. This activity is performed for customers seeking a\nspecific return or risk profile. Substantially all of our\ntransactions involve the resecuritization of conforming\nmortgage-backed securities issued by the GSEs or guaranteed by\nGNMA. We do not consolidate the resecuritization VIEs as we\nshare in the decision-making power with third parties and do not\nhold significant economic interests in the VIEs other than for\nmarket-making activities. During the quarters ended March 31,\n2025 and 2024, we transferred trading debt securities of $\n4.9billion and $ 2.7billion, respectively, to resecuritization\nVIEs, and retained trading debt securities of $ 575million and $\n229million, respectively. These amounts are not included in\nTable 13.1. As of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, we held\n$ 1.1billion and $ 819million of trading debt securities,\nrespectively. Total resecuritization VIE assets, to which we\nsold assets and hold an interest, were $ 49.8billion and $\n44.1billion at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024,\nrespectively.\n                                \n  104    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nSold or Securitized Loans Serviced for Others\nTable 13.3 presents information about loans that we have\noriginated and sold or securitized in which we have ongoing\ninvolvement as servicer. For loans sold or securitized where\nservicing is our only form of continuing involvement, we\ngenerally experience a loss only if we were required to\nrepurchase a delinquent loan or foreclosed asset due to a breach\nin representations and warranties associated with our loan sale\nor servicing contracts.

Table 13.4 includes nonconforming\nmortgage loan securitizations where we originate and transfer\nthe loans to the unconsolidated securitization VIEs that we\nsponsor. For additional information about these VIEs, see the\n\u201cLoan Sales and Securitization Activity\u201d section within this\nNote. Conforming loan securitization and resecuritization\ntransactions involving the GSEs and GNMA are excluded from Table\n13.4 because we are not the sponsor or we do not have power over\nthe activities most significant to the VIEs. Additionally, due\nto the nature of the guarantees provided by the GSEs and the FHA\nand VA, our credit risk associated with these VIEs is limited.\nFor additional information about conforming mortgage loan\nsecuritizations and resecuritizations, see the \u201cLoan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity\u201d and \u201cResecuritization Activities\u201d\nsections within this Note. COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS. We may\ntransfer purchased industrial development bonds and GSE credit\nenhancements to VIEs in exchange for beneficial interests. We\nmay also acquire such beneficial interests in transactions where\nwe do not act as a transferor. We own all of the beneficial\ninterests and may also service the underlying mortgages that\nserve as collateral to the bonds. The GSEs have the power to\ndirect the servicing and workout activities of the VIE in the\nevent of a default, therefore we do not have control over the\nkey decisions of the VIEs. OTHER VIE STRUCTURES. We engage in\nvarious forms of structured finance arrangements with other\nVIEs, including asset-backed finance structures. Collateral may\ninclude rental properties and mortgage loans. We may participate\nin structuring or marketing the arrangements as well as provide\nfinancing, service one or more of the underlying assets, or\nenter into derivatives with the VIEs. We may also receive fees\nfor those services. We are not the primary beneficiary of these\nstructures because we do not have power to direct the most\nsignificant activities of the VIEs.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    105  \n                                \nNote 13: Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities\n(continued)\nTable 13.4 provides a summary of our exposure to the\nunconsolidated VIEs described above, which includes investments\nin securities, loans, guarantees, liquidity agreements,\ncommitments and certain derivatives. We exclude certain\ntransactions with unconsolidated VIEs when our continuing\ninvolvement is temporary or administrative in nature or\ninsignificant in size. In Table 13.4, \u201cTotal VIE assets\u201d\nrepresents the remaining principal balance of assets held by\nunconsolidated VIEs using the most current information\navailable. \u201cCarrying value\u201d is the amount in our consolidated\nbalance sheet related to our involvement with the unconsolidated\nVIEs. \u201cMaximum exposure to loss\u201d is determined as the carrying\nvalue of our investment in the VIEs excluding the unconditional\nrepurchase options that have not been exercised, plus the\nremaining undrawn liquidity and lending commitments, the\nnotional amount of net written derivative contracts, and\ngenerally the notional amount of, or stressed loss estimate for,\nother commitments and guarantees. Debt, guarantees and other\ncommitments include amounts related to lending arrangements,\nliquidity agreements, and certain loss sharing obligations\nassociated with loans originated, sold, and serviced under\ncertain GSE programs. \u201cMaximum exposure to loss\u201d represents\nestimated loss that would be incurred under severe, hypothetical\ncircumstances, for which we believe the possibility is extremely\nremote, such as where the value of our interests and any\nassociated collateral declines to zero, without any\nconsideration of recovery or offset from any economic hedges.\nAccordingly, this disclosure is not an indication of expected\nloss.\nTable 13.4: Unconsolidated VIEs\n                                                                \n

Additionally, we had loans to tax credit VIEs with\na carrying value of $ 2.0billion and $ 1.9billion at March 31,\n2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively. Our maximum exposure\nto loss for tax credit VIEs at March 31, 2025, and December 31,\n2024, was $ 28.5billion and $ 29.1billion, respectively. Our\nmaximum exposure to loss included total unfunded equity and\nlending commitments of $ 5.5billion at both March 31, 2025, and\nDecember 31, 2024. Under these commitments, we are required to\nprovide additional financial support during the investment\nperiod, at the discretion of project sponsors, or for certain\nrenewable energy investments, on a contingent basis based on the\namount of income tax credits earned. For equity investments\naccounted for using the proportional amortization method, a\nliability is recognized in accrued expenses and liabilities on\nour consolidated balance sheet for unfunded commitments that are\neither legally binding or contingent but probable of funding.\nThe liability recognized for these commitments at March 31,\n2025, and December 31, 2024, was $ 5.8billion and $ 6.4billion,\nrespectively. Substantially all of these commitments are\nexpected to be funded within three years.

We are\nthe primary beneficiary of the following structure types:\nCOMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASES. We previously\nsecuritized dealer floor plan loans in a revolving master trust\nentity. As servicer and holder of all beneficial interests, we\ncontrol the key decisions of the trust and consolidate the VIE.\nIn first quarter 2024, we removed the loans held by the master\ntrust entity by transferring them to another subsidiary of Wells\nFargo, which had no impact on our consolidated balance sheet. In\na separate transaction structure, we may provide the majority of\ndebt and equity financing to an SPE that engages in lending and\nleasing to specific vendors and we service the underlying\ncollateral. CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS. Beginning in first\nquarter 2024, we securitized a portion of our credit card loans\nto provide a source of funding. Credit card securitizations\ninvolve the transfer of credit card loans to a master trust that\nissues debt securities to third party investors that are\ncollateralized by the transferred credit card loans. The\nunderlying securitized credit card loans and other assets in the\nmaster trust are available only for payment of the debt\nsecurities issued by the master trust; they are not available to\npay our other obligations. In addition, the investors in the\ndebt securities do not have recourse to the general credit of\nWells Fargo. We consolidate the master trust because, as the\nservicer of the credit card loans, we have the power to direct\nthe activities that most significantly impact the economic\nperformance and hold variable interests potentially significant\nto the VIE. We hold a minimum of 5% seller\u2019s interest in the\ntransferred credit card loans and we retain subordinated\nsecurities issued by the master trust, which collectively could\nresult in exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits\nfrom the master trust. As of March 31, 2025, and December 31,\n2024, we held seller\u2019s interest of $ 6.1billion and $\n6.5billion, respectively, in the transferred credit card loans\nand subordinated securities of $ 750million (at par) in both\nperiods issued by the master trust, which are both eliminated in\nour consolidated financial statements. The transferred credit\ncard loans and debt securities issued to third parties are\nrecognized on our consolidated balance sheet, and classified as\nloans and long-term debt, respectively. Table 13.6 presents a\nsummary of financial assets and liabilities of our consolidated\nVIEs. The carrying value represents assets and liabilities\nrecognized on our consolidated balance sheet. \u201cTotal VIE assets\u201d\nincludes affiliate balances that are eliminated upon\nconsolidation, and therefore in some instances will differ from\nthe carrying value of assets. On our consolidated balance sheet,\nwe separately disclose (1) the consolidated assets of certain\nVIEs that can only be used to settle the liabilities of those\nVIEs, and (2) the consolidated liabilities of certain VIEs for\nwhich the VIE creditors do not have recourse to Wells Fargo.\n\nTable 13.6: Transactions with Consolidated VIEs\n                                                                \n  (in               Ca\u2026                                   Acc\u2026  \n  mi\u2026               va\u2026               All                 exp\u2026  \n  Ma\u2026       Tot\u2026      \u2013               ot\u2026                  and  \n  31,        VIE    as\u2026               as\u2026          Lo\u2026    oth\u2026  \n  20\u2026       ass\u2026    (l\u2026  Loa\u2026         (1)          de\u2026    lia\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Co\u2026                                                           \n  and                                                           \n  in\u2026    $  1,7\u2026    1,\u2026          170            \u2014         -130  \n  lo\u2026                                                           \n  and                                                           \n  le\u2026                                                           \n  Cr\u2026                                                           \n  ca\u2026       9,3\u2026    9,\u2026           26         -2,\u2026           -4  \n  se\u2026                                                           \n  Ot\u2026        662      \u2014          660            \u2014           -2  \n  To\u2026                                                           \n  co\u2026    $  11,\u2026    10\u2026          856         -2,\u2026         -136  \n  VI\u2026                                                           \n  De\u2026                                                           \n  31,                                                           \n  20\u2026                                                           \n  Co\u2026                                                           \n  and                                                           \n  in\u2026    $  1,7\u2026    1,\u2026          167            \u2014         -118  \n  lo\u2026                                                           \n  and                                                           \n  le\u2026                                                           \n  Cr\u2026                                                           \n  ca\u2026       9,8\u2026    9,\u2026           25         -2,\u2026           -5  \n  se\u2026                                                           \n  Ot\u2026        479      \u2014          479            \u2014           -1  \n  To\u2026                                                           \n  co\u2026    $  12,\u2026    11\u2026          671         -2,\u2026         -124  \n  VI\u2026                                                           \n                                                                \n(1) All other assets includes\nloans held for sale and other\nassets.\n\nOther Transactions In addition\nto the transactions included in\nthe previous tables, we have\nused wholly-owned trust\npreferred security VIEs to\nissue debt securities or\npreferred equity exclusively to\nthird-party investors.

Accordingly,\nthese amounts are not an indication of expected loss. We believe\nthe carrying value is more representative of our current\nexposure to loss than maximum exposure to loss. The carrying\nvalue represents the fair value of the guarantee, if any, and\nalso includes an ACL for guarantees, if applicable. In\ndetermining the ACL for guarantees, we consider the credit risk\nof the related contingent obligation. For our guarantees in\nTable 14.1, non-investment grade represents those guarantees on\nwhich we have a higher risk of performance under the terms of\nthe guarantee, which is determined based on an external rating\nor an internal credit grade that is below investment grade, if\napplicable. WRITTEN OPTIONS. We enter into written foreign\ncurrency options and over-the-counter written equity put options\nthat are derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a\nguarantee. The fair value of written options represents our view\nof the probability that we will be required to perform under the\ncontract. The fair value of these written options was a\nliability of $ 122million and $ 88million at March 31, 2025, and\nDecember 31, 2024, respectively. The fair value may be an asset\nas a result of deferred premiums on certain option trades. The\nmaximum exposure to loss represents the notional value of these\nderivative contracts. At March 31, 2025, the maximum exposure to\nloss was $ 56.4billion, with $ 53.2billion expiring in three\nyears or less compared with $ 34.3billion and $ 31.5billion,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2024. See Note 11 (Derivatives)\nfor additional information regarding written derivative\ncontracts. MERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES. We provide debit and\ncredit card transaction processing services through payment\nnetworks directly for merchants and as a sponsor for merchant\nprocessing servicers, including our joint venture with a third\nparty that is accounted for as an equity method investment. In\nour role as the merchant acquiring bank, we have a potential\nobligation in connection with payment and delivery disputes\nbetween the merchant and the cardholder that are resolved in\nfavor of the cardholder, referred to as a charge-back\ntransaction. We estimate our potential maximum exposure to be\nthe total merchant transaction volume processed in the preceding\nfour months, which is generally the lifecycle for a charge-back\ntransaction. As of March 31, 2025, our potential maximum\nexposure was approximately $ 430.5billion, and related losses,\nincluding those from our joint venture entity, were\ninsignificant. GUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES. The Parent fully and\nunconditionally guarantees the payment of principal, interest,\nand any other amounts that may be due on securities that its\n100% owned finance subsidiary, Wells Fargo Finance LLC, may\nissue.These securities are not guaranteed by any other\nsubsidiary of the Parent. The guaranteed liabilities were $\n1.3billion at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024. These\nguarantees rank on parity with all of the Parent\u2019s other\nunsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    109  \n                                \nNote 14: Guarantees and Other\nCommitments (continued)\n\nOTHER COMMITMENTS. As of March\n31, 2025, and December 31,\n2024, we had commitments to\npurchase equity securities of $\n6.8billion and $ 6.6billion,\nrespectively, which\npredominantly included Federal\nReserve Bank stock and tax\ncredit investments accounted\nfor using the equity method. We\nhave commitments to enter into\nresale and securities borrowing\nagreements as well as\nrepurchase and securities\nlending agreements with certain\ncounterparties, including\ncentral clearing organizations.\nThe amount of our unfunded\ncontractual commitments for\nresale and securities borrowing\nagreements was $ 41.7billion\nand $ 27.3billion as of March\n31, 2025, and December 31,\n2024, respectively. The amount\nof our unfunded contractual\ncommitments for repurchase and\nsecurities lending agreements\nwas $ 2.8billion and $\n2.0billion as of March 31,\n2025, and December 31, 2024,\nrespectively. Given the nature\nof these commitments, they are\nexcluded from Table 5.4\n(Unfunded Credit Commitments)\nin Note 5 (Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit Losses).\n                                \n  110    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \n                                           \n  Note 15:Securities Financing Activities  \n                                           \nWe enter into resale and repurchase agreements and securities\nborrowing and lending agreements (collectively, \u201csecurities\nfinancing activities\u201d) typically to finance trading positions\n(including securities and derivatives), acquire securities to\ncover short trading positions, accommodate customers\u2019 financing\nneeds, and settle other securities obligations. These activities\nare conducted through our broker-dealer subsidiaries and, to a\nlesser extent, through other bank entities. Our securities\nfinancing activities predominantly involve high-quality, liquid\nsecurities such as U.S. Treasury securities and government\nagency securities and, to a lesser extent, less liquid\nsecurities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and\nasset-backed securities. We account for these transactions as\ncollateralized financings in which we typically receive or\npledge securities as collateral. We believe these financing\ntransactions generally do not have material credit risk given\nthe collateral provided and the related monitoring processes.\nOFFSETTING OF SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES. Table 15.1\npresents resale and repurchase agreements subject to master\nrepurchase agreements (MRA) and securities borrowing and lending\nagreements subject to master securities lending agreements\n(MSLA). Where legally enforceable, these master netting\narrangements give the ability, in the event of default by the\ncounterparty, to liquidate securities held as collateral and to\noffset receivables and payables with the same counterparty.\nSecurities financings with the same counterparty are presented\nnet on our consolidated balance sheet, provided certain criteria\nare met that permit balance sheet netting. The majority of\ntransactions subject to these agreements do not meet those\ncriteria and thus are not eligible for balance sheet netting.\nSecurities collateral we pledge is not netted on our\nconsolidated balance sheet against the related liability.\nSecurities collateral we receive is not recognized on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. Collateral pledged or received may\nbe increased or decreased over time to maintain certain\ncontractual thresholds, as the assets underlying each\narrangement fluctuate in value. For additional information on\ncollateral pledged and received, see Note 16 (Pledged Assets and\nCollateral). Generally, these agreements require collateral to\nexceed the asset or liability recognized on the balance sheet.\nThe following table includes the amount of collateral pledged or\nreceived related to exposures subject to enforceable MRAs or\nMSLAs. While these agreements are typically over-collateralized,\nthe disclosure in this table is limited to the reported amount\nof such collateral to the amount of the related recognized asset\nor liability for each counterparty. In addition to the amounts\nincluded in Table 15.1, we also have balance sheet netting\nrelated to derivatives that is disclosed in Note 11\n(Derivatives).\nTable 15.1: Offsetting \u2013 Securities

Securities sold\nunder repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements\nare effectively short-term collateralized borrowings. In these\ntransactions, we receive cash in exchange for transferring\nsecurities as collateral and recognize an obligation to\nreacquire the securities for cash at the transaction\u2019s maturity.\nThese types of transactions create risks, including (1) the\ncounterparty may fail to return the securities at maturity, (2)\nthe fair value of the securities transferred may decline below\nthe amount of our obligation to reacquire the securities, and\ntherefore create an obligation for us to pledge additional\namounts, and (3) the counterparty may accelerate the maturity on\ndemand, requiring us to reacquire the security prior to\ncontractual maturity. We attempt to mitigate these risks in\nvarious ways. Our collateral predominantly consists of highly\nliquid securities. In addition, we underwrite and monitor the\nfinancial strength of our counterparties, monitor the fair value\nof collateral pledged relative to contractually required\nrepurchase amounts, and monitor that our collateral is properly\nreturned through the clearing and settlement process in advance\nof our cash repayment.

At\nMarch 31, 2025, and December\n31, 2024, the fair value of\nthis collateral received that\nwe have the right to sell or\nrepledge was $ 314.8billion and\n$ 288.7billion, respectively,\nof which $ 175.9billion and $\n142.2billion, respectively,\nwere sold or repledged.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    113  \n                                \n                              \n  Note 17:Operating Segments  \n                              \nOur management reporting is organized into fourreportable\noperating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; Commercial\nBanking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and\nInvestment Management. All other business activities that are\nnot included in the reportable operating segments have been\nincluded in Corporate. We define our reportable operating\nsegments by type of product and customer segment, and their\nresults are based on our management reporting process. The\nmanagement reporting process measures the performance of the\nreportable operating segments based on the Company\u2019s management\nstructure, and the results are regularly reviewed with our Chief\nExecutive Officer (CEO) and relevant senior management. Our CEO\nis the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and reviews actual\nand forecasted operating segment net income for assessing\nperformance and deciding how to allocate resources. The\nmanagement reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and includes\nspecific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for\nasset/liability management, shared revenue and expenses, and\ntaxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income\nfrom taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management to\nassess performance consistently across the operating segments.\nConsumer Banking and Lending offers diversified financial\nproducts and services for consumers and small businesses with\nannual sales generally up to $ 10million. These financial\nproducts and services include checking and savings accounts,\ncredit and debit cards as well as home, auto, personal, and\nsmall business lending. Commercial Banking provides financial\nsolutions to private, family owned and certain public companies.\nProducts and services include banking and credit products across\nmultiple industry sectors and municipalities, secured lending\nand lease products, and treasury management. Corporate and\nInvestment Banking delivers a suite of capital markets, banking,\nand financial products and services to corporate, commercial\nreal estate, government and institutional clients globally.\nProducts and services include corporate banking, investment\nbanking, treasury management, commercial real estate lending and\nservicing, equity and fixed income solutions as well as sales,\ntrading, and research capabilities. Wealth and Investment\nManagement provides personalized wealth management, brokerage,\nfinancial planning, lending, private banking, trust and\nfiduciary products and services to affluent, high-net worth and\nultra-high-net worth clients. We operate through financial\nadvisors in our brokerage and wealth offices, consumer bank\nbranches, independent offices, and digitally through WellsTrade\n\u00ae and Intuitive Investor \u00ae. Corporate includes corporate\ntreasury and enterprise functions, net of expense allocations,\nin support of the reportable operating segments (including funds\ntransfer pricing, capital, and liquidity), as well as our\ninvestment portfolio and venture capital and private equity\ninvestments. Corporate also includes certain lines of business\nthat management has determined are no longer consistent with the\nlong-term strategic goals of the Company as well as results for\npreviously divested businesses. Basis of Presentation FUNDS\nTRANSFER PRICING. Corporate treasury manages a funds transfer\npricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, liquidity\nrisk, and other product characteristics. Operating segments pay\na funding charge for their assets and receive a funding credit\nfor their deposits, both of which are included in net interest\nincome. The net impact of the funding charges or credits is\nrecognized in corporate treasury. REVENUE SHARING AND EXPENSE\nALLOCATIONS. When lines of business jointly serve customers, the\nline of business that is responsible for providing the product\nor service recognizes revenue or expense with a referral fee\npaid or an allocation of cost to the other line of business\nbased on established internal revenue-sharing agreements. When a\nline of business uses a service provided by another line of\nbusiness, expense is generally allocated based on the cost and\nuse of the service provided. Enterprise functions, such as\noperations, technology, and risk management, are included in\nCorporate with an allocation of their applicable costs to the\nreportable operating segments based on the level of support\nprovided by the enterprise function. We periodically assess and\nupdate our revenue sharing and expense allocation methodologies.\nTable 17.1 includes the allocated expenses from Corporate to the\nreportable operating segments within the relevant personnel and\nnon-personnel expense lines. Personnel expense is a significant\nexpense for our reportable operating segments. Non-personnel\nexpense includes other expense categories that are consistent\nwith those presented in our consolidated statement of income,\nsuch as technology, telecommunications and equipment expense,\noccupancy expense, and professional and outside services\nexpense. TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS. Taxable-equivalent\nadjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and\ndebt securities are included in net interest income, while\ntaxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for\naffordable housing and renewable energy investments are included\nin noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts\nto income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in\nCorporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment\nBanking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company\u2019s\nconsolidated financial results.\n

The Standardized Approach applies assigned risk\nweights to broad risk categories, while the calculation of risk-\nweighted assets (RWAs) under the Advanced Approach differs by\nrequiring applicable banks to utilize a risk-sensitive\nmethodology, which relies upon the use of internal credit\nmodels, and includes an operational risk component.\nTable 22.1: Regulatory Capital Information\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                \n                                             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                \n                                             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                \n                                             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                             \u2026             \u2026    \n                                             \u2026             \u2026    \n                                             \u2026             \u2026    \n                                                                \n                                             \u2026             \u2026    \n                                             \u2026             \u2026    \n                                                                \n* Denotes the binding ratio under the Standardized and Advanced\nApproaches at March 31, 2025.\n(1) Adjusted average assets consists of total quarterly average\nassets less goodwill and other permitted Tier 1 capital\ndeductions. The Tier 1 leverage ratio consists of Tier 1 capital\ndivided by total quarterly average assets, excluding goodwill\nand certain other items as determined under capital rule\nrequirements.\n(2) The supplementary leverage ratio consists of Tier 1 capital\ndivided by total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure\nconsists of total consolidated assets adjusted for certain off-\nbalance sheet exposures, goodwill, and other permitted Tier 1\ncapital deductions.\nAt March 31, 2025, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 and\nTotal capital ratio requirements for the Company included a\nglobal systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge of 1.50%\nand a countercyclical buffer of 0.00%. In addition, these ratios\nincluded a stress capital buffer of 3.80% under the Standardized\nApproach and a capital conservation buffer of 2.50% under the\nAdvanced Approach. The Company is required to maintain these\nrisk-based capital ratios and to maintain a supplementary\nleverage ratio (SLR) that included a supplementary leverage\nbuffer of 2.00% to avoid restrictions on capital distributions\nand discretionary bonus payments. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total\ncapital ratio requirements for the Bank included a capital\nconservation buffer of 2.50% under both the Standardized and\nAdvanced Approaches. The G-SIB surcharge and countercyclical\nbuffer are not applicable to the Bank. At March 31, 2025, the\nBank and our other insured depository institutions were\nconsidered well-capitalized under the requirements of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act. Capital Planning Requirements The\nFRB\u2019s capital plan rule establishes capital planning and other\nrequirements that govern capital distributions, including\ndividends and share repurchases, by certain large bank holding\ncompanies (BHCs), including Wells Fargo. The FRB conducts an\nannual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review exercise and\nhas also published guidance regarding its supervisory\n                                \n  122    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nexpectations for capital\nplanning, including capital\npolicies regarding the process\nrelating to common stock\ndividend and repurchase\ndecisions in the FRB\u2019s SR\nLetter 15-18. The Parent\u2019s\nability to make certain capital\ndistributions is subject to the\nrequirements of the capital\nplan rule and is also subject\nto the Parent meeting or\nexceeding certain regulatory\ncapital minimums. Loan and\nDividend Restrictions Federal\nlaw restricts the amount and\nthe terms of both credit and\nnon-credit transactions between\na bank and its nonbank\naffiliates. Additionally,\nfederal laws and regulations\nlimit, and regulators can\nimpose additional limitations\non, the dividends that a\nnational bank may pay. Our\nnonbank subsidiaries are also\nlimited by certain federal and\nstate statutory provisions and\nregulations covering the amount\nof dividends that may be paid\nin any given year. In addition,\nwe have entered into a Support\nAgreement dated June 28, 2017,\nas amended and restated on June\n26, 2019, among Wells Fargo &\nCompany, the parent holding\ncompany (Parent), WFC Holdings,\nLLC, an intermediate holding\ncompany and subsidiary of the\nParent (IHC), the Bank, Wells\nFargo Securities, LLC, Wells\nFargo Clearing Services, LLC,\nand certain other subsidiaries\nof the Parent designated from\ntime to time as material\nentities for resolution\nplanning purposes or identified\nfrom time to time as related\nsupport entities in our\nresolution plan, pursuant to\nwhich the IHC may be restricted\nfrom making dividend payments\nto the Parent if certain\nliquidity and/or capital\nmetrics fall below defined\ntriggers or if the Parent\u2019s\nboard of directors authorizes\nit to file a case under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code.
