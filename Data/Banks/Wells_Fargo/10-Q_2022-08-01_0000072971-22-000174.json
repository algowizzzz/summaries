Tangible book value per common\nshare is tangible common equity divided by\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\n(3) Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure and represents total equity\nless preferred equity, noncontrolling\ninterests, goodwill, certain identifiable\nintangible assets (other than mortgage\nservicing rights) and goodwill and other\nintangibles on investments in consolidated\nportfolio companies, net of applicable\ndeferred taxes. The methodology of determining\ntangible common equity may differ among\ncompanies. Management believes that return on\naverage tangible common equity and tangible\nbook value per common share, which utilize\ntangible common equity, are useful financial\nmeasures because they enable management,\ninvestors, and others to assess the Company\u2019s\nuse of equity.

Addressing\nthese regulatory\nactions is expected to\ntake multiple years,\nand we are likely to\nexperience issues or\ndelays along the way\nin satisfying their\nrequirements. Issues\nor delays with one\nregulatory action\ncould affect our\nprogress on others,\nand failure to satisfy\nthe requirements of a\nregulatory action on a\ntimely basis could\nresult in additional\npenalties, enforcement\nactions, and other\nnegative consequences,\nwhich could be\nsignificant.

As required by\nthe consent order, the\nCompany\u2019s Board of\nDirectors (Board)\nsubmitted to the FRB a\nplan to further\nenhance the Board\u2019s\ngovernance and\noversight of the\nCompany, and the\nCompany submitted to\nthe FRB a plan to\nfurther improve the\nCompany\u2019s compliance\nand operational risk\nmanagement program.\nThe Company continues\nto engage with the FRB\nas the Company works\nto address the consent\norder provisions. The\nconsent order also\nrequires the Company,\nfollowing the FRB\u2019s\nacceptance and\napproval of the plans\nand the Company\u2019s\nadoption and\nimplementation of the\nplans, to complete an\ninitial third-party\nreview of the\nenhancements and\nimprovements provided\nfor in the plans.\nUntil this third-party\nreview is complete\n\nand the plans are\napproved and\nimplemented to the\nsatisfaction of the\nFRB, the Company\u2019s\ntotal consolidated\nassets as defined\nunder the consent\norder will be limited\nto the level as of\nDecember 31, 2017.\nCompliance with this\nasset cap is measured\non a two-quarter daily\naverage basis to allow\nfor management of\ntemporary\nfluctuations. After\nremoval of the asset\ncap, a second third-\nparty review must also\nbe conducted to assess\nthe efficacy and\nsustainability of the\nenhancements and\nimprovements.\n\nConsent Orders with\nthe Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau and\nOffice of the\nComptroller of the\nCurrency Regarding\nCompliance Risk\nManagement Program,\nAutomobile Collateral\nProtection Insurance\nPolicies, and Mortgage\nInterest Rate Lock\nExtensions\n\nOn April 20, 2018, the\nCompany entered into\nconsent orders with\nthe Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau\n(CFPB) and the Office\nof the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (OCC) to\npay an aggregate of $1\nbillion in civil money\npenalties to resolve\nmatters regarding the\nCompany\u2019s compliance\nrisk management\nprogram and past\npractices involving\ncertain automobile\ncollateral protection\ninsurance (CPI)\npolicies and certain\nmortgage interest rate\nlock extensions. As\nrequired by the\nconsent orders, the\nCompany submitted to\nthe CFPB and OCC an\nenterprise-wide\ncompliance risk\nmanagement plan and a\nplan to enhance the\nCompany\u2019s internal\naudit program with\nrespect to federal\nconsumer financial law\nand the terms of the\nconsent orders. In\naddition, as required\nby the consent orders,\nthe Company submitted\nfor non-objection\nplans to remediate\ncustomers affected by\nthe automobile\ncollateral protection\ninsurance and mortgage\ninterest rate lock\nmatters, as well as a\nplan for the\nmanagement of\nremediation activities\nconducted by the\nCompany. The Company\ncontinues to work to\naddress the provisions\nof the consent orders.\nThe Company has not\nyet satisfied certain\naspects of the consent\norders, and as a\nresult, we believe\nregulators may impose\nadditional penalties\nor take other\nenforcement actions.\nOn September 9, 2021,\nthe OCC assessed a\n$250 million civil\nmoney penalty against\nthe Company related to\ninsufficient progress\nin addressing\nrequirements under the\nOCC\u2019s April 2018\nconsent order and loss\nmitigation activities\nin the Company\u2019s Home\nLending business.\n\nConsent Order with the\nOCC Regarding Loss\nMitigation Activities\n\nOn September 9, 2021,\nthe Company entered\ninto a consent order\nwith the OCC requiring\nthe Company to improve\nthe execution, risk\nmanagement, and\noversight of loss\nmitigation activities\nin its Home Lending\nbusiness.

On September\n8, 2021, the CFPB\nconsent order\nregarding retail sales\npractices expired.\n\nOur priority of\nrebuilding trust has\nalso included an\neffort to identify\nother areas or\ninstances where\ncustomers may have\nexperienced financial\nharm, provide\nremediation as\nappropriate, and\nimplement additional\noperational and\ncontrol procedures. We\nare working with our\nregulatory agencies in\nthis effort. We have\npreviously disclosed\nkey areas of focus as\npart of our rebuilding\ntrust efforts and are\nin the process of\nproviding remediation\nfor those matters. We\nhave accrued for the\nprobable and estimable\nremediation costs\nrelated to our\nrebuilding trust\nefforts, which amounts\nmay change based on\nadditional facts and\ninformation, as well\nas ongoing reviews and\ncommunications with\nour regulators. As our\nongoing reviews\ncontinue and as we\ncontinue to strengthen\nour risk and control\ninfrastructure, we\nhave identified and\nmay in the future\nidentify additional\nitems or areas of\npotential concern. To\nthe extent issues are\nidentified, we will\ncontinue to assess any\ncustomer harm and\nprovide remediation as\nappropriate.\n\nFor additional\ninformation regarding\nretail sales practices\nmatters and other\ncustomer remediation\nactivities, including\nrelated legal and\nregulatory risk, see\nthe \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nsection in our 2021\nForm 10-K and Note 13\n(Legal Actions) to\nFinancial Statements\nin this Report.\n                                              \n  Recent Developments                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  LIBOR Transition                            \n                                              \nThe London Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR)\nis a widely referenced\nbenchmark rate that\nseeks to estimate the\ncost at which banks\ncan borrow on an\nunsecured basis from\nother banks. On March\n5, 2021, the United\nKingdom\u2019s Financial\nConduct Authority and\nICE Benchmark\nAdministration, the\nadministrator of\nLIBOR, announced that\ncertain settings of\nLIBOR would no longer\nbe published on a\nrepresentative basis\nafter December 31,\n2021, and the most\ncommonly used U.S.\ndollar (USD) LIBOR\nsettings would no\nlonger be published on\na representative basis\nafter June 30, 2023.\nCentral banks in\nvarious jurisdictions\nconvened committees to\nidentify replacement\nrates to facilitate\nthe transition away\nfrom LIBOR. The\ncommittee convened by\nthe Federal Reserve in\nthe United States, the\nAlternative Reference\nRates Committee\n(ARRC), recommended\nthe Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (SOFR)\nas the replacement\nrate for USD LIBOR.\nAdditionally, the\nFederal Reserve, the\nOCC and the Federal\nDeposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC)\nhave issued guidance\nstrongly encouraging\nbanking organizations\nto cease using USD\nLIBOR as a reference\nrate in new contracts.\n\nIn preparation for the\ncessation of the\nvarious LIBOR\nsettings, we have\nundertaken a variety\nof activities. Among\nother things, we\nproactively\nimplemented internal\n\u201cstop-sell\u201d dates to\ndiscontinue offering\nproducts referencing\nLIBOR except pursuant\nto limited exceptions\nconsistent with\nregulatory guidance.\nAt the same time, we\nexpanded our suite of\nproduct offerings that\nare indexed to\nalternative reference\nrates.\n\nWe also continue to\ntransition our legacy\nLIBOR contracts to\nalternative reference\nrates. We transitioned\nsubstantially all of\nour legacy contracts\nwith LIBOR settings\nimpacted by the\nDecember 31, 2021,\ncessation date to\nalternative reference\nrates, and we will\ncontinue to address\ncontracts with LIBOR\nsettings that are\nimpacted by the June\n30, 2023, cessation\ndate.\n\nIn first quarter 2022,\nthe Adjustable\nInterest Rate Act (the\nLIBOR Act) was enacted\nto provide a statutory\nframework to replace\nLIBOR with a benchmark\nrate based on SOFR in\ncontracts that do not\nhave fallback\nprovisions or that\nhave fallback\nprovisions resulting\nin a replacement rate\nbased on LIBOR. We\nexpect that the LIBOR\nAct will allow for the\ntransition of certain\nof our commercial\ncredit facilities and\nother contracts that\ndo not have\nappropriate fallback\nprovisions to replace\nLIBOR.\n\nFor additional\ninformation on the\namounts of certain of\nour LIBOR-linked\ncontracts, as well as\nour transition plans\nfor these contracts,\nsee the \u201cOverview \u2013\nRecent Developments \u2013\nLIBOR Transition\u201d\nsection in our 2021\nForm 10-K.

Adjustments\nare included in\nCorporate, Commercial\nBanking, and Corporate\nand Investment Banking\nand are eliminated to\nreconcile to the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial results.\n\nAllocated Capital\nReportable operating\nsegments are allocated\ncapital under a risk-\nsensitive framework\nthat is primarily\nbased on aspects of\nour regulatory capital\nrequirements, and the\nassumptions and\nmethodologies used to\nallocate capital are\nperiodically assessed\nand revised.\nManagement believes\nthat return on\nallocated capital is a\nuseful financial\nmeasure because it\nenables management,\ninvestors, and others\nto assess a reportable\noperating segment\u2019s\nuse of capital.\n\nSelected Metrics We\npresent certain\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial metrics\nthat management uses\nwhen evaluating\nreportable operating\nsegment results.\nManagement believes\nthat these metrics are\nuseful to investors\nand others to assess\nthe performance,\ncustomer growth, and\ntrends of reportable\noperating segments or\nlines of business.\n                                              \n   Table 4:                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n   Management Reporting Structure             \n                                              \n                                              \n  W\u2026                                          \n  F\u2026                                          \n  &                                           \n  C\u2026                                          \n        Co\u2026           Co\u2026    W\u2026               \n        Ba\u2026    Co\u2026    and    a\u2026    Co\u2026        \n        and    Ba\u2026    In\u2026    I\u2026               \n        Le\u2026           Ba\u2026    M\u2026               \n                                          \u2022   \n        \u2022                                 C\u2026  \n        Co\u2026                               T\u2026  \n        and                               \u2022   \n        Sm\u2026                               E\u2026  \n        Bu\u2026    \u2022                          F\u2026  \n        Ba\u2026    Mi\u2026    \u2022      \u2022            \u2022   \n        \u2022      Ma\u2026    Ba\u2026    W\u2026           I\u2026  \n        Ho\u2026    Ba\u2026    \u2022      F\u2026           P\u2026  \n        Le\u2026    \u2022      Co\u2026    A\u2026           \u2022   \n        \u2022      As\u2026    Re\u2026    \u2022            A\u2026  \n        Cr\u2026    Le\u2026    Es\u2026    T\u2026           v\u2026  \n        Ca\u2026    and    \u2022      P\u2026           c\u2026  \n        \u2022      Le\u2026    Ma\u2026    B\u2026           a\u2026  \n        Au\u2026                               p\u2026  \n        \u2022                                 e\u2026  \n        Pe\u2026                               b\u2026  \n        Le\u2026                               \u2022   \n                                          N\u2026  \n                                          b\u2026  \n                                              \n                               \n  12    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 5 and the\nfollowing discussion\npresent our results by\nreportable operating\nsegment.

Credit Risk\nManagement We define\ncredit risk as the\nrisk of loss\nassociated with a\nborrower or\ncounterparty default\n(failure to meet\nobligations in\naccordance with agreed\nupon terms). Credit\nrisk exists with many\nof the Company\u2019s\nassets and exposures\nsuch as loans, debt\nsecurities, and\ncertain derivatives.\nThe Board\u2019s Risk\nCommittee has primary\noversight\nresponsibility for\ncredit risk. A Credit\nSubcommittee of the\nRisk Committee assists\nthe Risk Committee in\nproviding oversight of\ncredit risk. At the\nmanagement level,\nCredit Risk, which is\npart of Independent\nRisk Management, has\noversight\nresponsibility for\ncredit risk. Credit\nRisk reports to the\nChief Risk Officer and\nsupports periodic\nreports related to\ncredit risk provided\nto the Board\u2019s Risk\nCommittee or its\nCredit Subcommittee.\nLoan Portfolio Our\nloan portfolios\nrepresent the largest\ncomponent of assets on\nour consolidated\nbalance sheet for\nwhich we have credit\nrisk.

Our credit\nrisk management oversight process is governed\ncentrally, but provides for direct management\nand accountability by our lines of business.\nOur overall credit process includes\ncomprehensive credit policies, disciplined\ncredit underwriting, frequent and detailed\nrisk measurement and modeling, extensive\ncredit training programs, and a continual loan\nreview and audit process. A key to our credit\nrisk management is adherence to a well-\ncontrolled underwriting process, which we\nbelieve is appropriate for the needs of our\ncustomers as well as investors who purchase\nthe loans or securities collateralized by the\nloans. Credit Quality Overview Credit quality\nin second quarter 2022 reflected: \u2022 Nonaccrual\nloans were $6.0 billion at June 30, 2022,\ncompared with $7.2 billion at December 31,\n2021. Commercial nonaccrual loans decreased to\n$1.7 billion at June 30, 2022, compared with\n$2.4 billion at December 31, 2021, and\nconsumer nonaccrual loans decreased to $4.3\nbillion at June 30, 2022, compared with $4.8\nbillion at December 31, 2021. Nonaccrual loans\nrepresented 0.64% of total loans at June 30,\n2022, compared with 0.81% at December 31,\n2021. \u2022 Net loan charge-offs (recoveries) as a\npercentage of our average commercial and\nconsumer loan portfolios were 0.02% and 0.33%\nin the second quarter and 0.00% and 0.34% in\nthe first half of 2022, respectively, compared\nwith 0.07% and 0.32% in the second quarter and\n0.10% and 0.35%, respectively, in the first\nhalf of 2021. \u2022 Loans that are not government\ninsured/guaranteed and 90 days or more past\ndue and still accruing were $579 million and\n$412 million in our commercial and consumer\nportfolios, respectively, at June 30, 2022,\ncompared with $235 million and $424 million at\nDecember 31, 2021. \u2022 Our provision for credit\nlosses for loans was $578 million and $(197)\nmillion in the second quarter and first half\nof 2022, respectively, compared with $(1.2)\nbillion and $(2.4) billion for the same\nperiods a year ago. \u2022 The ACL for loans\ndecreased to $12.9 billion, or 1.37% of total\nloans, at June 30, 2022, compared with $13.8\nbillion, or 1.54%, at December 31, 2021.\nAdditional information on our loan portfolios\nand our credit quality trends follows.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    29  \n                               \nRisk Management \u2013\nCredit Risk Management\n(continued)\n\nSignificant Loan\nPortfolio Reviews\nMeasuring and\nmonitoring our credit\nrisk is an ongoing\nprocess that tracks\ndelinquencies,\ncollateral values,\nFair Isaac Corporation\n(FICO) scores,\neconomic trends by\ngeographic areas,\nloan-level risk\ngrading for certain\nportfolios (typically\ncommercial) and other\nindications of credit\nrisk.

In\naddition, we review a\nvariety of credit\nmetrics and trends.\nThese credit metrics\nand trends, however,\ndo not solely\ndetermine the amount\nof the allowance as we\nuse several analytical\ntools. For additional\ninformation on our\nACL, see the \u201cCritical\nAccounting Policies \u2013\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses\u201d section and\nNote 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial\nStatements in our 2021\nForm 10-K.

The ACL\nfor loans decreased\n$904 million, or 7%,\nfrom December 31,\n2021, reflecting\nreduced uncertainty\naround the economic\nimpact of the COVID-19\npandemic on our loan\nportfolio. This\ndecrease was partially\noffset by increased\nuncertainty related to\nthe risks of high\ninflation, as well as\nloan growth. The\ndetail of the changes\nin the ACL for loans\nby portfolio segment\n(including charge-offs\nand recoveries by loan\nclass) is included in\nNote 4 (Loans and\nRelated Allowance for\nCredit Losses) to\nFinancial Statements\nin this Report. We\nconsider multiple\neconomic scenarios to\ndevelop our estimate\nof the ACL for loans,\nwhich generally\ninclude a base\nscenario, along with\nan optimistic (upside)\nand one or more\npessimistic (downside)\nscenarios. In our\nestimate of the ACL\nfor loans at June 30,\n2022, we weighted the\nbase scenario and the\ndownside scenarios to\nreflect our economic\noutlook. The base\nscenario assumed\nmoderate economic\ngrowth with elevated\ninflation in the near\nterm. The downside\nscenarios assumed\neconomic contractions\ndue to high inflation\nand rising interest\nrates. Additionally,\nwe consider\nqualitative factors\nthat represent risks\ninherent in our\nprocesses and\nassumptions such as\neconomic environmental\nfactors, modeling\nassumptions and\nperformance, and other\nsubjective factors,\nincluding industry\ntrends and emerging\nrisk assessments.

We believe\nthe ACL for loans of\n$12.9 billion at June\n30, 2022, was\nappropriate to cover\nexpected credit\nlosses, including\nunfunded credit\ncommitments, at that\ndate. The entire\nallowance is available\nto absorb credit\nlosses from the total\nloan portfolio. The\nACL for loans is\nsubject to change and\nreflects existing\nfactors as of the date\nof determination,\nincluding economic or\nmarket conditions and\nongoing internal and\nexternal examination\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    41  \n                               \nprocesses. Due to the\nsensitivity of the ACL\nfor loans to changes\nin the economic and\nbusiness environment,\nit is possible that we\nwill incur incremental\ncredit losses not\nanticipated as of the\nbalance sheet date.\nOur process for\ndetermining the ACL is\ndiscussed in the\n\u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies \u2013 Allowance\nfor Credit Losses\u201d\nsection and Note 1\n(Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial\nStatements in our 2021\nForm 10-K.\n\nMORTGAGE BANKING\nACTIVITIES We sell\nresidential and\ncommercial mortgage\nloans to various\nparties. In connection\nwith our sales and\nsecuritization of\nresidential mortgage\nloans, we have\nestablished a mortgage\nrepurchase liability.\nFor information on our\nrepurchase liability,\nsee the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Credit\nRisk Management \u2013\nMortgage Banking\nActivities\u201d section in\nour 2021 Form 10-K.\n\nIn addition to\nservicing loans in our\nportfolio, we act as\nservicer and/or master\nservicer of\nresidential and\ncommercial mortgage\nloans included in\ngovernment sponsored\nentity\n(GSE)-guaranteed\nmortgage\nsecuritizations, GNMA-\nguaranteed mortgage\nsecuritizations of\nFHA-insured/VA-\nguaranteed mortgages\nand private label\nmortgage\nsecuritizations, as\nwell as for\nunsecuritized loans\nowned by institutional\ninvestors.\n\nAs a servicer, we are\nrequired to advance\ncertain delinquent\npayments of principal\nand interest on\nmortgage loans we\nservice. The amount\nand timing of\nreimbursement for\nadvances of delinquent\npayments vary by\ninvestor and the\napplicable servicing\nagreements. See Note 9\n(Mortgage Banking\nActivities) to\nFinancial Statements\nin this Report for\nadditional information\nabout residential and\ncommercial servicing\nrights, servicer\nadvances and servicing\nfees.\n\nIn accordance with\napplicable servicing\nguidelines,\ndelinquency status\ncontinues to advance\nfor loans with COVID-\nrelated payment\ndeferrals, which has\nresulted in an\nincrease in delinquent\nloans serviced for\nothers and a\ncorresponding increase\nin loans eligible for\nrepurchase from GNMA\nloan securitization\npools. Upon transfer\nas servicer, we retain\nthe option to\nrepurchase loans from\nGNMA loan\nsecuritization pools,\nwhich generally\nbecomes exercisable\nwhen three scheduled\nloan payments remain\nunpaid by the\nborrower. We generally\nrepurchase these loans\nfor cash and as a\nresult, our total\nconsolidated assets do\nnot change. These\nrepurchased loan\nbalances were $10.9\nbillion and $17.3\nbillion at June 30,\n2022 and December 31,\n2021, respectively,\nwhich included $8.4\nbillion and $12.9\nbillion, respectively,\nin our held for\ninvestment loan\nportfolio, with the\nremainder in loans\nheld for sale.\n\nRepurchased loans that\nregain current status\nor are otherwise\nmodified in accordance\nwith applicable\nservicing guidelines\nmay be included in\nfuture GNMA loan\nsecuritization pools.\nHowever, in accordance\nwith guidance issued\nby GNMA, certain loans\nrepurchased after June\n30, 2020, are\nineligible for\ninclusion in future\nGNMA loan\nsecuritization pools\nuntil the borrower has\ntimely made six\nconsecutive payments.\nThis requirement may\ndelay our ability to\nresell loans into the\nsecuritization market.\nSee Note 8\n(Securitizations and\nVariable Interest\nEntities) to Financial\nStatements in this\nReport for additional\ninformation about our\ninvolvement with\nmortgage loan\nsecuritizations.\n\nFor additional\ninformation about the\nrisks related to our\nservicing activities,\nsee the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Credit\nRisk Management \u2013\nMortgage Banking\nActivities\u201d section in\nour 2021 Form 10-K.\nFor additional\ninformation on\nmortgage banking\nactivities, see Note 9\n(Mortgage Banking\nActivities) to\nFinancial Statements\nin this Report.\n                                              \n  Asset/Liability Management                  \n                                              \nAsset/liability\nmanagement involves\nevaluating, monitoring\nand managing interest\nrate risk, market\nrisk, liquidity and\nfunding. For\ninformation on our\noversight of\nasset/liability risks,\nsee the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement\u201d section in\nour 2021 Form 10-K.\n\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nInterest rate risk is\ncreated in our role as\na financial\nintermediary for\ncustomers based on\ninvestments such as\nloans and other\nextensions of credit\nand debt securities.\nInterest rate risk can\nhave a significant\nimpact to our\nearnings. We are\nsubject to interest\nrate risk because:\n\n\u2022 assets and\nliabilities may mature\nor reprice at\ndifferent times. If\nassets reprice faster\nthan liabilities and\ninterest rates are\ngenerally rising,\nearnings will\ninitially increase;\n\n\u2022 assets and\nliabilities may\nreprice at the same\ntime but by different\namounts;\n\n\u2022 short-term and long-\nterm market interest\nrates may change by\ndifferent amounts. For\nexample, the shape of\nthe yield curve may\naffect yield for new\nloans and funding\ncosts differently;\n\n\u2022 the remaining\nmaturity for various\nassets or liabilities\nmay shorten or\nlengthen as interest\nrates change. For\nexample, if long-term\nmortgage interest\nrates increase\nsharply, MBS held in\nthe debt securities\nportfolio may pay down\nat a slower rate than\nanticipated, which\ncould impact portfolio\nincome; or\n\n\u2022 interest rates may\nhave a direct or\nindirect effect on\nloan demand,\ncollateral values,\ncredit losses,\nmortgage origination\nvolume, and the fair\nvalue of MSRs and\nother financial\ninstruments.\n\nWe assess interest\nrate risk by comparing\noutcomes under various\nnet interest income\nsimulations using many\ninterest rate\nscenarios that differ\nin the direction of\ninterest rate changes,\nthe degree of change\nover time, the speed\nof change and the\nprojected shape of the\nyield curve. These\nsimulations require\nassumptions regarding\ndrivers of earnings\nand balance sheet\ncomposition such as\nloan originations,\nprepayment rates on\nloans and debt\nsecurities, deposit\nflows and mix, as well\nas pricing strategies.\n\nOur most recent\nsimulations, as\npresented in Table 24,\nestimate net interest\nincome sensitivity\nover the next 12\nmonths using\ninstantaneous\nmovements across the\nyield curve with both\nlower and higher\ninterest rates\nrelative to our base\nscenario. Steeper and\nflatter scenarios\nmeasure non-parallel\nchanges in the yield\ncurve, with long-term\ninterest rates defined\nas all tenors three\nyears and longer and\nshort-term interest\nrates defined as all\ntenors less than three\nyears. Where\napplicable, U.S.\ndollar interest rates\nare floored at 0.00%.\nThe following\ndescribes the\nsimulation assumptions\nfor the scenarios\npresented in Table 24:\n\n\u2022 Simulations are\ndynamic and reflect\nanticipated changes to\nour assets and\nliabilities.\n\n\u2022 Other macroeconomic\nvariables that could\nbe correlated with the\nchanges in interest\nrates are held\nconstant.\n\n\u2022 Mortgage prepayment\nand origination\nassumptions vary\nacross scenarios and\nreflect only the\nimpact of the higher\nor lower interest\nrates.\n\n\u2022 Our base scenario\ndeposit forecast\nincorporates mix\nchanges consistent\nwith the base interest\nrate trajectory.\nDeposit mix is modeled\nto be the same as in\nthe base scenario\nacross the alternative\nscenarios. In higher\ninterest rate\nscenarios, customer\ndeposit activity that\nshifts balances into\nhigher-yielding\nproducts could impact\nexpected net interest\nincome.\n                               \n  42    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \n\u2022 The interest rate\nsensitivity of\ndeposits is modeled\nusing the historical\nbehavior of our\ndeposits portfolio and\nreflects the\nexpectations of\ndeposit products\nrepricing as market\ninterest rates change\n(referred to as\ndeposit betas) as well\nas shifts in the mix\nof our deposit\nproducts.

Our interest\nrate sensitivity indicates that we would\nexpect to benefit from higher interest rates\nas our assets would reprice faster and to a\ngreater degree than our liabilities, while in\nthe case of lower interest rates, our assets\nwould reprice downward and to a greater degree\nthan our liabilities resulting in lower net\ninterest income. For the December 31, 2021\nsimulations with downward shifts in interest\nrates, the 0.00% interest rate floor limited\nthe amount of the decline in net interest\nincome. We may have a larger decline in net\ninterest income when interest rates increase\nfor the base scenario relative to the interest\nrate floor. The sensitivity results above do\nnot capture noninterest income or expense\nimpacts. Our interest rate sensitive\nnoninterest income and expense are primarily\ndriven by mortgage banking activities, and may\nmove in the opposite direction of our net\ninterest income. See the \u201cRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability Management \u2013 Mortgage Banking\nInterest Rate and Market Risk\u201d section in our\n2021 Form 10-K for additional information.\nInterest rate sensitive noninterest income is\nalso impacted by changes in earnings credit\nfor noninterest-bearing deposits that reduce\ntreasury management deposit service fees, and\ntrading assets, which are generally less\nsensitive to changes in interest rates than\nthe related funding liabilities. In addition,\nthe impact to net interest income does not\ninclude the fair value changes of trading\nsecurities, which are recorded in noninterest\nincome. For additional information on our\ntrading assets and liabilities, see Note 2\n(Trading Activities) to Financial Statements\nin this Report. We use the debt securities\nportfolio and exchange-traded and over-the-\ncounter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to\nmanage our interest rate exposures. As\ninterest rates increase, changes in the fair\nvalue of AFS debt securities may negatively\naffect accumulated other comprehensive income\n(AOCI), which lowers the amount of our risk-\nbased capital. AOCI also includes unrealized\ngains or losses related to the transfer of\ndebt securities from AFS to HTM, which are\nsubsequently amortized into earnings over the\nlife of the security with no further impact\n\nfrom interest rate changes. See Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies)\nand Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\nMaturity Debt Securities) to Financial\nStatements in this Report for additional\ninformation on the debt securities portfolios.\nWe use derivatives for asset/liability\nmanagement in two main ways: \u2022 to convert the\ncash flows from selected asset and/or\nliability instruments/portfolios including\ninvestments, commercial loans and long-term\ndebt, from floating-rate payments to fixed-\nrate payments, or vice versa; and \u2022 to\neconomically hedge our mortgage origination\npipeline, funded mortgage loans, and MSRs. In\nthe first half of 2022, we entered into\ninterest rate swap hedges to reduce AOCI\nsensitivity of our AFS debt securities\nportfolio. Additionally, we entered into\ninterest rate swaps to convert the interest\ncash flows of some floating-rate assets, such\nas commercial loans, to a fixed-rate.\nDerivatives used to hedge our interest rate\nrisk exposures are presented in Note 14\n(Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this\nReport. MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND\nMARKET RISK We originate, fund and service\nmortgage loans, which subjects us to various\nrisks, including credit, liquidity and\ninterest rate risks. For additional\ninformation on mortgage banking interest rate\nand market risk, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking\nActivities) to Financial Statements in this\nReport and the \u201cRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability Management \u2013 Mortgage Banking\nInterest Rate and Market Risk\u201d section in our\n2021 Form 10-K. Hedging the various sources of\ninterest rate risk in mortgage banking is a\ncomplex process that requires sophisticated\nmodeling and constant monitoring. There are\nseveral potential risks to earnings from\nmortgage banking related to origination\nvolumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and\nassociated hedging results, the relationship\nand degree of volatility between short-term\nand long-term interest rates, and changes in\nservicing and foreclosures costs. While we\nattempt to balance our mortgage banking\ninterest rate and market risks, the financial\ninstruments we use may not perfectly correlate\nwith the values and income being hedged.\nMARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of\npossible economic loss from adverse changes in\nmarket risk factors such as interest rates,\ncredit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity\nand commodity prices, and the risk of possible\nloss due to counterparty exposure. This\napplies to implied volatility risk, basis\nrisk, and market liquidity risk. It also\nincludes price risk in the trading book,\nmortgage servicing rights and the hedge\neffectiveness risk associated with the\nmortgage book, and impairment of private\nequity investments. For information on our\noversight of market risk, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Asset/Liability Management \u2013\nMarket Risk\u201d section in our 2021 Form 10-K.\nMARKET RISK \u2013 TRADING ACTIVITIES We engage in\ntrading activities to accommodate the\ninvestment and risk management activities of\nour customers and to execute economic hedging\nto manage certain balance sheet risks. These\ntrading activities predominantly occur within\nour CIB businesses and to a lesser extent\nother businesses of the Company. Debt\nsecurities held for trading, equity securities\nheld for trading, trading loans and trading\nderivatives are financial instruments used in\nour trading activities, and all are carried at\nfair value. Income earned on the financial\ninstruments used in our trading activities\ninclude net interest income, changes in fair\nvalue and realized gains and losses. Net\ninterest income earned from our trading\nactivities is\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    43  \n                               \nRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement (continued)\n\nreflected in the\ninterest income and\ninterest expense\ncomponents of our\nconsolidated statement\nof income. Changes in\nfair value of the\nfinancial instruments\nused in our trading\nactivities are\nreflected in net gains\nfrom trading\nactivities. For\nadditional information\non the financial\ninstruments used in\nour trading activities\nand the income from\nthese trading\nactivities, see Note 2\n(Trading Activities)\nto Financial\nStatements in this\nReport.\n\nValue-at-risk (VaR) is\na statistical risk\nmeasure used to\nestimate the potential\nloss from adverse\nmoves in the financial\nmarkets. The Company\nuses VaR metrics\ncomplemented with\nsensitivity analysis\nand stress testing in\nmeasuring and\nmonitoring market\nrisk. For additional\ninformation on our\nmonitoring activities,\nsensitivity analysis\nand stress testing,\nsee the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Market\nRisk \u2013 Trading\nActivities\u201d section in\nour 2021 Form 10-K.\n\nTrading VaR is the\nmeasure used to\nprovide insight into\nthe market risk\nexhibited by the\nCompany\u2019s trading\npositions. The Company\ncalculates Trading VaR\nfor risk management\npurposes to establish\nline of business and\nCompany-wide risk\nlimits. Trading VaR is\ncalculated based on\nall trading positions\non our consolidated\nbalance sheet.\n\nTable 25 shows the\nCompany\u2019s Trading\nGeneral VaR by risk\ncategory. The decrease\nin average Company\nTrading General VaR\nfor the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2022,\ncompared with the same\nperiod a year ago, was\ndriven by reduced\nmarket volatility in\nthe lookback window\nused to calculate\naverage Company\nTrading General VaR\nfor the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2022. Market\nvolatility present in\naverage Company\nTrading General VaR\nfor the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2021, was\ndriven by the impact\nof the COVID-19\npandemic, primarily\nresulting in changes\nin interest rate\ncurves and a\nsignificant widening\nof credit spreads.\n\nTable 25: Trading\n1-Day 99% General VaR\nby Risk Category\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) The period-end VaR\nwas less than the sum\nof the VaR components\ndescribed above, which\nis due to portfolio\ndiversification. The\ndiversification effect\narises because the\nrisks are not\nperfectly correlated\ncausing a portfolio of\npositions to usually\nbe less risky than the\nsum of the risks of\nthe positions alone.\nThe diversification\nbenefit is not\nmeaningful for low and\nhigh metrics since\nthey may occur on\ndifferent days.\n\nMARKET RISK \u2013 EQUITY\nSECURITIES We are\ndirectly and\nindirectly affected by\nchanges in the equity\nmarkets. We make and\nmanage direct\ninvestments in start-\nup businesses,\nemerging growth\ncompanies, management\nbuy-outs, acquisitions\nand corporate\nrecapitalizations. We\nalso invest in non-\naffiliated funds that\nmake similar private\nequity investments.\nFor additional\ninformation, see the\n\u201cRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Market\nRisk \u2013 Equity\nSecurities\u201d section in\nour 2021 Form 10-K.\n\nWe also have\nmarketable equity\nsecurities that\ninclude investments\nrelating to our\nventure capital\nactivities. The fair\nvalue changes in these\nmarketable equity\nsecurities are\nrecognized in net\nincome. For additional\ninformation, see Note\n6 (Equity Securities)\nto Financial\nStatements in this\nReport.\n\nChanges in equity\nmarket prices may also\nindirectly affect our\nnet income by (1) the\nvalue of third-party\nassets under\nmanagement and, hence,\nfee income, (2)\nborrowers whose\nability to repay\nprincipal and/or\ninterest may be\naffected by the stock\nmarket, or (3)\nbrokerage activity,\nrelated commission\nincome and other\nbusiness activities.\nEach business line\nmonitors and manages\nthese indirect risks.\n\nLIQUIDITY RISK AND\nFUNDING In the\nordinary course of\nbusiness, we enter\ninto contractual\nobligations that may\nrequire future cash\npayments, including\nfunding for customer\nloan requests,\ncustomer deposit\nmaturities and\nwithdrawals, debt\nservice, leases for\npremises and\nequipment, and other\ncash commitments. The\nobjective of effective\nliquidity management\nis to ensure that we\ncan meet our\ncontractual\nobligations and other\n\ncash commitments\nefficiently under both\nnormal operating\nconditions and under\nperiods of Wells\nFargo-specific and/or\nmarket stress. To help\nachieve this\nobjective, we monitor\nboth the consolidated\ncompany and the Parent\non a stand-alone basis\nto ensure that the\nParent is a source of\nstrength for its\nregulated, deposit-\ntaking banking\nsubsidiaries. The\nParent acts as a\nsource of funding for\nthe Company through\nthe issuance of long-\nterm debt and equity,\nand WFC Holdings, LLC,\nan intermediate\nholding company and\nsubsidiary of the\nParent (the \u201cIHC\u201d),\nprovides funding\nsupport for the\nongoing operational\nrequirements of the\nParent and certain of\nits direct and\nindirect subsidiaries.\nFor additional\ninformation on\nliquidity risk and\nfunding management,\nsee the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Liquidity\nRisk and Funding\u201d\nsection in our 2021\nForm 10-K.

The rule\nrequires a covered\nbanking organization\nto hold high-quality\nliquid assets (HQLA)\nin an amount equal to\nor greater than its\nprojected net cash\noutflows during a\n30-day stress period.\nOur HQLA under the\nrule predominantly\nconsists of central\nbank deposits,\ngovernment debt\nsecurities, and\nmortgage-backed\nsecurities of federal\nagencies. The LCR\napplies to the Company\non a consolidated\nbasis and to our\ninsured depository\ninstitutions (IDIs)\nwith total assets of\n$10 billion or\n                               \n  44    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nmore. In addition,\nrules issued by the\nFRB impose enhanced\nliquidity risk\nmanagement standards\non large bank holding\ncompanies (BHCs), such\nas Wells Fargo.\n\nThe FRB, OCC and FDIC\nhave also issued a\nrule implementing a\nstable funding\nrequirement, known as\nthe net stable funding\nratio (NSFR), which\nrequires a covered\nbanking organization,\nsuch as Wells Fargo,\nto maintain a minimum\namount of stable\nfunding, including\ncommon equity, long-\nterm debt and most\ntypes of deposits, in\nrelation to its\nassets, derivative\nexposures and\ncommitments over a\none-year horizon\nperiod.

We are a\nmember of the FHLBs\nbased in Dallas, Des\nMoines and San\nFrancisco. FHLB\nmembers are required\nto maintain a minimum\ninvestment in capital\nstock of the\napplicable FHLB. The\nboard of directors of\neach FHLB can increase\nthe minimum investment\nrequirements in the\nevent it has concluded\nthat additional\ncapital is required to\nallow it to meet its\nown regulatory capital\nrequirements. Any\nincrease in the\nminimum investment\nrequirements outside\nof specified ranges\nrequires the approval\nof the Federal Housing\nFinance Agency.\nBecause the extent of\nany obligation to\nincrease our\ninvestment in any of\nthe FHLBs depends\nentirely upon the\noccurrence of a future\nevent, the amount of\nany future investment\nin the capital stock\nof the FHLBs is not\ndeterminable.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    47  \n                               \n                      \n  Capital Management  \n                      \nWe have an active\nprogram for managing\ncapital through a\ncomprehensive process\nfor assessing the\nCompany\u2019s overall\ncapital adequacy. Our\nobjective is to\nmaintain capital at an\namount commensurate\nwith our risk profile\nand risk tolerance\nobjectives, and to\nmeet both regulatory\nand market\nexpectations. We\nprimarily fund our\ncapital needs through\nthe retention of\nearnings net of both\ndividends and share\nrepurchases, as well\nas through the\nissuance of preferred\nstock and long- and\nshort-term debt.\nRetained earnings at\nJune 30, 2022,\nincreased $4.2 billion\nfrom December 31,\n2021, predominantly as\na result of $6.8\nbillion of Wells Fargo\nnet income, partially\noffset by $2.5 billion\nof common and\npreferred stock\ndividends. During the\nfirst half of 2022, we\nissued $716 million of\ncommon stock,\nsubstantially all of\nwhich was issued in\nconnection with\nemployee compensation\nand benefits. In the\nfirst half of 2022, we\nrepurchased 110\nmillion shares of\ncommon stock at a cost\nof $6 billion. In the\nfirst half of 2022,\nour AOCI decreased\n$8.9 billion,\npredominantly due to\nnet unrealized losses\non AFS debt\nsecurities. As\ninterest rates\nincrease, changes in\nthe fair value of AFS\ndebt securities may\nnegatively affect\nAOCI, which lowers the\namount of our risk-\nbased capital.

Risk-\nbased capital rules\nestablish risk-\nadjusted ratios\nrelating regulatory\ncapital to different\ncategories of assets\nand off-balance sheet\nexposures as discussed\nbelow.\n\nRISK-BASED CAPITAL AND\nRISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS\nThe Company is subject\nto rules issued by\nfederal banking\nregulators to\nimplement Basel III\ncapital requirements\nfor U.S. banking\norganizations. The\nrules contain two\nframeworks for\ncalculating capital\nrequirements, a\nStandardized Approach\nand an Advanced\nApproach applicable to\ncertain institutions,\nincluding Wells Fargo,\nand we must calculate\nour risk-based capital\nratios under both\napproaches. The\nCompany is required to\nsatisfy the risk-based\ncapital ratio\nrequirements to avoid\nrestrictions on\ncapital distributions\nand discretionary\nbonus payments. Table\n31 and Table 32\npresent the risk-based\ncapital requirements\napplicable to the\nCompany under the\nStandardized Approach\nand Advanced Approach,\nrespectively, as of\nJune 30, 2022.\n\nTable 31: Risk-Based\nCapital Requirements \u2013\nStandardized Approach\nas of June 30, 2022\n\nTable 32: Risk-Based\nCapital Requirements \u2013\nAdvanced Approach as\nof June 30, 2022\n\nIn addition to the\nrisk-based capital\nrequirements described\nin Table 31 and Table\n32, if the FRB\ndetermines that a\nperiod of excessive\ncredit growth is\ncontributing to an\nincrease in systemic\nrisk, a\ncountercyclical buffer\nof up to 2.50% could\nbe added to the risk-\nbased capital ratio\nrequirements under\nfederal banking\nregulations. The\ncountercyclical buffer\nin effect at June 30,\n2022, was 0.00%.\n\nThe capital\nconservation buffer is\napplicable to certain\ninstitutions,\nincluding Wells Fargo,\nunder the Advanced\nApproach and is\nintended to absorb\nlosses during times of\neconomic or financial\nstress.\n                               \n  48    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nThe stress capital\nbuffer is calculated\nbased on the decrease\nin a BHC\u2019s risk-based\ncapital ratios under\nthe severely adverse\nscenario in the FRB\u2019s\nannual supervisory\nstress test and\nrelated Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and\nReview (CCAR), plus\nfour quarters of\nplanned common stock\ndividends. Because the\nstress capital buffer\nis calculated annually\nbased on data that can\ndiffer over time, our\nstress capital buffer,\nand thus our risk-\nbased capital ratio\nrequirements under the\nStandardized Approach,\nare subject to change\nin future periods. Our\nstress capital buffer\nfor the period October\n1, 2021, through\nSeptember 30, 2022, is\n3.10%. We expect our\nstress capital buffer\nfor the period October\n1, 2022, through\nSeptember 30, 2023, to\nbe 3.20%. The FRB has\nindicated that it will\npublish the final\nstress capital buffer\nfor the period October\n1, 2022, through\nSeptember 30, 2023,\nfor each BHC by August\n31, 2022.\n\nAs a global\nsystemically important\nbank (G-SIB), we are\nalso subject to the\nFRB\u2019s rule\nimplementing an\nadditional capital\nsurcharge of between\n1.00-4.50% on the\nrisk-based capital\nratio requirements of\nG-SIBs. Under the\nrule, we must annually\ncalculate our\nsurcharge under two\nmethods and use the\nhigher of the two\nsurcharges. The first\nmethod (method one)\nconsiders our size,\ninterconnectedness,\ncross-jurisdictional\nactivity,\nsubstitutability, and\ncomplexity, consistent\nwith the methodology\ndeveloped by the BCBS\nand the Financial\nStability Board (FSB).\nThe second method\n(method two) uses\nsimilar\n\ninputs, but replaces\nsubstitutability with\nuse of short-term\nwholesale funding and\nwill generally result\nin higher surcharges\nthan under method one.\nBecause the G-SIB\ncapital surcharge is\ncalculated annually\nbased on data that can\ndiffer over time, the\namount of the\nsurcharge is subject\nto change in future\nyears. If our annual\ncalculation results in\na decrease to our\nG-SIB capital\nsurcharge, the\ndecrease takes effect\nthe next calendar\nyear. If our annual\ncalculation results in\nan increase to our\nG-SIB capital\nsurcharge, the\nincrease takes effect\nin two calendar years.\nFor 2022, our G-SIB\ncapital surcharge is\n1.50%.\n\nUnder the risk-based\ncapital rules, on-\nbalance sheet assets\nand credit equivalent\namounts of derivatives\nand off-balance sheet\nitems are assigned to\none of several broad\nrisk categories\naccording to the\nobligor, or, if\nrelevant, the\nguarantor or the\nnature of any\ncollateral. The\naggregate dollar\namount in each risk\ncategory is then\nmultiplied by the risk\nweight associated with\nthat category. The\nresulting weighted\nvalues from each of\nthe risk categories\nare aggregated for\ndetermining total\nrisk-weighted assets\n(RWAs).\n\nThe tables that follow\nprovide information\nabout our risk-based\ncapital and related\nratios as calculated\nunder Basel III\ncapital rules.

end.\n\n(2) In second quarter\n2020, the Company\nelected to apply a\nmodified transition\nprovision issued by\nfederal banking\nregulators related to\nthe impact of the\ncurrent expected\ncredit loss accounting\nstandard (CECL) on\nregulatory capital.\nThe rule permits\ncertain banking\norganizations to\nexclude from\nregulatory capital the\ninitial adoption\nimpact of CECL, plus\n25% of the cumulative\nchanges in the\nallowance for credit\nlosses (ACL) under\nCECL for each period\nuntil December 31,\n2021, followed by a\nthree-year phase-out\nperiod in which the\nbenefit is reduced

Capital\nPlanning and Stress\nTesting Our planned\nlong-term capital\nstructure is designed\nto meet regulatory and\nmarket expectations.\nWe believe that our\nlong-term targeted\ncapital structure\nenables us to invest\nin and grow our\nbusiness, satisfy our\ncustomers\u2019 financial\nneeds in varying\nenvironments, access\nmarkets, and maintain\nflexibility to return\ncapital to our\nshareholders. Our\nlong-term targeted\ncapital structure also\nconsiders capital\nlevels sufficient to\nexceed capital\nrequirements including\nthe G-SIB capital\nsurcharge.\nAccordingly, we\ncurrently target a\nlong-term CET1 capital\nratio that is 100\nbasis points above the\nregulatory minimum and\nbuffers, plus an\nincremental internal\nbuffer of up to 25\nbasis points. Our\ncapital targets are\nsubject to change\nbased on various\nfactors, including\nchanges to the\nregulatory\nrequirements for our\ncapital ratios,\nplanned capital\nactions, changes in\nour risk profile and\nother factors. The FRB\ncapital plan rule\nestablishes capital\nplanning and other\nrequirements that\ngovern capital\ndistributions,\nincluding dividends\nand share repurchases,\nby certain BHCs,\nincluding Wells Fargo.\nThe FRB assesses,\namong other things,\nthe overall financial\ncondition, risk\nprofile, and capital\nadequacy of BHCs when\nevaluating their\ncapital plans. As part\nof the annual\nComprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review,\nthe FRB generates a\nsupervisory stress\ntest. The FRB reviews\nthe supervisory stress\ntest results as\nrequired under the\nDodd-Frank Act using a\ncommon set of capital\nactions for all large\nBHCs and also reviews\nthe Compan y\u2019s p\nroposed capital\nactions . The FRB\npublished its\nsupervisory stress\ntest results on June\n23, 2022. On July 26,\n2022, the Board\napproved an increase\nto the Company\u2019s third\nquarter 2022 common\nstock dividend to\n$0.30 per share.\nFederal banking\nregulators also\nrequire large BHCs and\nbanks to conduct their\nown stress tests to\nevaluate whether the\ninstitution has\nsufficient capital to\ncontinue to operate\nduring periods of\nadverse economic and\nfinancial conditions.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    53  \n                               \n                                              \n  Capital Management(continued)               \n                                              \n                                              \n  Securities Repurchases                      \n                                              \nFrom time to time the\nBoard authorizes the\nCompany to repurchase\nshares of our common\nstock. Although we\nannounce when the\nBoard authorizes share\nrepurchases, we\ntypically do not give\nany public notice\nbefore we repurchase\nour shares. Various\nfactors determine the\namount of our share\nrepurchases, including\nour capital\nrequirements, the\nnumber of shares we\nexpect to issue for\nemployee benefit plans\nand acquisitions,\nmarket conditions\n(including the trading\nprice of our stock),\nand regulatory and\nlegal considerations,\nincluding under the\nFRB\u2019s capital plan\nrule. Due to the\nvarious factors that\nmay impact the\n\namount of our share\nrepurchases and the\nfact that we tend to\nbe in the market\nregularly to satisfy\nrepurchase\nconsiderations under\nour capital plan, our\nshare repurchases\noccur at various price\nlevels. We may suspend\nshare repurchase\nactivity at any time.\n\nAt June 30, 2022, we\nhad remaining Board\nauthority to\nrepurchase\napproximately 251\nmillion shares,\nsubject to regulatory\nand legal conditions.\nFor additional\ninformation about\nshare repurchases\nduring second quarter\n2022, see Part II,\nItem 2 in this Report.\n                      \n  Regulatory Matters  \n                      \nThe U.S. financial\nservices industry is\nsubject to significant\nregulation and\nregulatory oversight\ninitiatives.

Six\nof these policies are\ncritical because they\nrequire management to\nmake difficult,\nsubjective and complex\njudgments about\nmatters that are\ninherently uncertain\nand because it is\nlikely that materially\ndifferent amounts\nwould be reported\nunder different\nconditions or using\ndifferent assumptions.\nThese policies govern:\n\n\u2022 the allowance for\ncredit losses;\n\n\u2022 the valuation of\nresidential MSRs;\n\n\u2022 the fair value of\nfinancial instruments;\n\n\u2022 income taxes;\n\n\u2022 liability for\ncontingent litigation\nlosses; and\n\n\u2022 goodwill impairment.\n\nManagement has\ndiscussed these\ncritical accounting\npolicies and the\nrelated estimates and\njudgments with the\nBoard\u2019s Audit\nCommittee.

We provide\nbanking, investment and mortgage products and\nservices, as well as consumer and commercial\nfinance, through banking locations and\noffices, the internet and other distribution\nchannels to individuals, businesses and\ninstitutions in all 50 states, the District of\nColumbia, and in countries outside the U.S.\nWhen we refer to \u201cWells Fargo,\u201d \u201cthe Company,\u201d\n\u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus,\u201d we mean Wells Fargo &\nCompany and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells\nFargo & Company (the Parent) is a financial\nholding company and a bank holding company. We\nalso hold a majority interest in a real estate\ninvestment trust, which has publicly traded\npreferred stock outstanding. Our accounting\nand reporting policies conform with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP) and practices in the financial services\nindustry. For discussion of our significant\naccounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 (2021 Form 10-K). There were\nno material changes to these policies in the\nfirst half of 2022. To prepare the financial\nstatements in conformity with GAAP, management\nmust make estimates based on assumptions about\nfuture economic and market conditions (for\nexample, unemployment, market liquidity, real\nestate prices, etc.) that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities at the date\nof the financial statements, income and\nexpenses during the reporting period and the\nrelated disclosures. Although our estimates\ncontemplate current conditions and how we\nexpect them to change in the future, it is\nreasonably possible that actual conditions\ncould be worse than anticipated in those\nestimates, which could materially affect our\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nManagement has made significant estimates in\nseveral areas, including: \u2022 allowance for\ncredit losses (Note 4 (Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit Losses)); \u2022 valuations of\nresidential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)\n(Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities) and Note 9 (Mortgage Banking\nActivities)); \u2022 valuations of financial\ninstruments (Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets\nand Liabilities)); \u2022 liabilities for\ncontingent litigation losses (Note 13 (Legal\nActions)); \u2022 income taxes; and \u2022 goodwill\nimpairment (Note 10 (Intangible Assets)).\nActual results could differ from those\nestimates. These unaudited interim financial\nstatements reflect all adjustments that are,\nin the opinion of management, necessary for a\nfair statement of the results for the periods\npresented. These adjustments are of a normal\nrecurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed\nin this Form 10-Q. The results of operations\nin the interim financial statements do not\nnecessarily indicate the results that may be\nexpected for the full year. The interim\nfinancial information should be read in\nconjunction with our 2021 Form 10-K.\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2022 In 2022,\nwe adopted the following new accounting\nguidance: \u2022 Accounting Standards Update (ASU\nor Update) 2020-06 \u2013 Debt \u2013 Debt with\nConversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20)\nand Derivatives and Hedging \u2013 Contracts in\nEntity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40):\nAccounting for Convertible Instruments and\nContracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity \u2022 ASU\n2021-05 \u2013 Leases (Topic 842): Lessors \u2013\nCertain Leases with Variable Lease Payments\nASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for\nconvertible financial instruments that embody\ncharacteristics of debt and equity by (1)\neliminating accounting models for convertible\nfinancial instruments with cash conversion and\nbeneficial conversion features within\nAccounting Standards Codification (ASC)\n470-20, (2) removing three equity\nclassification requirements for a contract in\nan entity's own equity to qualify for the\nderivative scope exception in ASC Subtopic\n815-40, and (3) prescribing the method used\nfor computing earnings per share. We adopted\nthis Update prospectively in first quarter\n2022. This Update did not have a material\nimpact to our consolidated financial\nstatements. ASU 2021-05 amends ASC 842 Topic \u2013\nLeases and provides specific guidance for\nlessors whose leases include variable lease\npayments that are not dependent on a reference\nindex or rate and otherwise would have\nresulted in the recognition of a loss at lease\ncommencement (a day 1 loss). Prior to ASU\n2016-02, variable lease payments were excluded\nfrom the definition of lease payments for\nlessors measuring their net investment loss in\na sales-type lease or direct financing lease.\nThis often resulted in a day 1 loss, even if\nthe lessor expected the arrangement to be\nprofitable overall. We adopted this Update\nprospectively in first quarter 2022. This\nUpdate did not have a material impact to our\nconsolidated financial statements.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    67  \n                               \nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies (continued)\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information Significant\nnoncash activities are presented in Table 1.1.\nTable 1.1: Supplemental Cash Flow Information\n                                              \n                                      Six     \n                                      months  \n                                      ended   \n                                      June    \n  (in                                 30,     \n  mill\u2026               2022            2021    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Avai\u2026                                       \n  debt                                        \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  purc\u2026                                       \n  from     $   1,506               \u2014          \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  LHFS                                        \n  (1)                                         \n  Held\u2026                                       \n  debt                                        \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  purc\u2026                                       \n  from           693          16,462          \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  LHFS                                        \n  (1)                                         \n  Tran\u2026                                       \n  from                                        \n  loans        4,970          11,551          \n  to                                          \n  LHFS                                        \n  Tran\u2026                                       \n  from                                        \n  avai\u2026                                       \n  debt                                        \n  secu\u2026       43,041          41,298          \n  to                                          \n  held\u2026                                       \n  debt                                        \n  secu\u2026                                       \n                                              \n(1) Predominantly represents agency mortgage-\nbacked securities purchased upon settlement of\nthe sale and securitization of our conforming\nresidential mortgage loans.

The credit quality\nindicators that we most closely monitor\ninclude credit ratings and delinquency status\nand are based on information as of our\nfinancial statement date. CREDIT RATINGS\nCredit ratings express opinions about the\ncredit quality of a debt security. We\ndetermine the credit rating of a security\naccording to the lowest credit rating made\navailable by national recognized statistical\nrating organizations (NRSROs). Debt securities\nrated investment grade, that is those with\nratings similar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as\ndefined by NRSROs, are generally considered by\nthe rating agencies and market participants to\nbe low credit risk. Conversely, debt\nsecurities rated below investment grade,\nlabeled as \u201cspeculative grade\u201d by the rating\nagencies, are considered to be distinctively\nhigher credit risk than investment grade debt\nsecurities. For debt securities not rated by\nNRSROs, we determine an internal credit grade\nof the debt securities (used for credit risk\nmanagement purposes) equivalent to the credit\nratings assigned by major credit agencies.\nSubstantially all of our debt securities were\nrated by NRSROs at June 30, 2022, and December\n31, 2021.

The maximum\ncredit risk for these\ncommitments will\ngenerally be lower\nthan the contractual\namount because these\ncommitments may expire\nwithout being used or\nmay be cancelled at\nthe customer\u2019s\nrequest. We may reduce\nor cancel lines of\ncredit in accordance\nwith the contracts and\napplicable law.\nCertain commitments\neither provide us with\nfunding discretion or\nare subject to loan\nagreements with\ncovenants regarding\nthe financial\nperformance of the\ncustomer or borrowing\nbase formulas that\nmust be met before we\nare required to fund\nthe commitment. Our\ncredit risk monitoring\nactivities include\nmanaging the amount of\ncommitments, both to\nindividual customers\nand in total, and the\nsize and maturity\nstructure of these\ncommitments. We do not\nrecognize an ACL for\ncommitments that are\nunconditionally\ncancellable at our\ndiscretion. We issue\ncommercial letters of\ncredit to assist\ncustomers in\npurchasing goods or\nservices, typically\nfor international\ntrade. At June 30,\n2022, and December 31,\n2021, we had $\n2.2billion and $\n1.5billion,\nrespectively, of\noutstanding issued\ncommercial letters of\ncredit. See Note 11\n(Guarantees and Other\nCommitments) for\nadditional information\non issued standby\nletters of credit.\n\nWe may be a fronting\nbank, whereby we act\nas a representative\nfor other lenders, and\nadvance funds or\nprovide for the\nissuance of letters of\ncredit under\nsyndicated loan or\nletter of credit\nagreements. Any\nadvances are generally\nrepaid in less than a\nweek and would\nnormally require\ndefault of both the\ncustomer and another\nlender to expose us to\nloss. The unfunded\namount of these\nfronting arrangements\ntotaled approximately\n$ 87.6billion at June\n30, 2022.\nThe contractual amount\nof our unfunded credit\ncommitments, including\nunissued letters of\ncredit, is summarized\nin Table 4.4.

The\nfollowing sections provide the credit quality\nindicators we most closely monitor. The credit\nquality indicators are generally based on\ninformation as of our financial statement\ndate. COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS We\nmanage a consistent process for assessing\ncommercial loan credit quality. Commercial\nloans are generally subject to individual risk\nassessment using our internal borrower and\ncollateral quality ratings, which is our\nprimary credit quality indicator. Our ratings\nare aligned to regulatory definitions of pass\nand criticized categories with the criticized\nsegmented among special mention, substandard,\ndoubtful and loss categories.

Loan delinquency, FICO\ncredit scores and loan-to-value (LTV) for\nresidential mortgage loans are the primary\ncredit quality indicators that we monitor and\nutilize in our evaluation of the\nappropriateness of the ACL for the consumer\nloan portfolio segment. Many of our loss\nestimation techniques used for the ACL for\nloans rely on delinquency-based models;\ntherefore, delinquency is an important\nindicator of credit quality in the\nestablishment of our ACL for consumer loans.\nTable 4.9 provides the outstanding balances of\nour consumer loan portfolio by delinquency\nstatus. Credit quality information is provided\nwith the year of origination for term loans.\nRevolving loans may convert to term loans as a\nresult of a contractual provision in the\noriginal loan agreement or if modified in a\nTDR. The revolving loans converted to term\nloans in the credit card loan category\nrepresent credit card loans with modified\nterms that require payment over a specific\nterm. Payment deferral activities in the\nresidential mortgage portfolio instituted in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic could\ncontinue to delay the recognition of\ndelinquencies for residential mortgage\ncustomers who otherwise would have moved into\npast due status.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    81  \n                               \nNote 4: Loans and Related

principal balance to the property\u2019s\ncollateral value. Combined LTV (CLTV) refers\nto the combination of first lien mortgage and\njunior lien mortgage (including unused line\namounts for credit line products) ratios. We\nobtain LTVs and CLTVs using a cascade approach\nwhich first uses values provided by automated\nvaluation models (AVMs) for the property. If\nan AVM is not available, then the value is\nestimated using the original appraised value\nadjusted by the change in Home Price Index\n(HPI) for the property location. If an HPI is\nnot available, the original appraised value is\nused. The HPI value is normally the only\nmethod considered for high value properties,\ngenerally with an original value of $ 1million\nor more, as the AVM values have proven less\naccurate for these properties. Generally, we\nobtain available LTVs\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    85  \n                               \nNote 4: Loans and Related Allowance for Credit\nLosses (continued)\n\nand CLTVs on a quarterly basis.

Under the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau guidelines, we do\nnot commence the foreclosure process on\nresidential mortgage loans until after the\nloan is 120 days delinquent. Foreclosure\nprocedures and timelines vary depending on\nwhether the property address resides in a\njudicial or non-judicial state. Judicial\nstates require the foreclosure to be processed\nthrough the state\u2019s courts while non-judicial\nstates are processed without court\nintervention. Foreclosure timelines vary\naccording to state law.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    87  \n                               \nNote 4: Loans and\nRelated Allowance for\nCredit Losses\n(continued)\n\nLOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE\nPAST DUE AND STILL\nACCRUING Certain loans\n90 days or more past\ndue are still\naccruing, because they\nare (1) well-secured\nand in the process of\ncollection or (2)\nresidential mortgage\nor consumer loans\nexempt under\nregulatory rules from\nbeing classified as\nnonaccrual until later\ndelinquency, usually\n120 days past due.\nTable 4.13 shows loans\n90 days or more past\ndue and still accruing\nby class for loans not\ngovernment\ninsured/guaranteed.\nTable 4.13: Loans 90\nDays or More Past Due\nand Still Accruing\n                                              \n                     Jun              Dec     \n  ($ in              30,              31,     \n  mill\u2026              2022             2021    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Tota\u2026    $  3,653            5,358          \n  Less:                                       \n  FHA                                         \n  insu\u2026       2,662            4,699          \n  guar\u2026                                       \n  (1)                                         \n  Tota\u2026                                       \n  not      $    991              659          \n  gove\u2026                                       \n  insu\u2026                                       \n  By                                          \n  segm\u2026                                       \n  and                                         \n  clas\u2026                                       \n  not                                         \n  gove\u2026                                       \n  insu\u2026                                       \n                                              \n  Comm\u2026                                       \n  Comm\u2026                                       \n  and      $    495              206          \n  indu\u2026                                       \n  Real                                        \n  esta\u2026          84               29          \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  Real                                        \n  esta\u2026           \u2014                \u2014          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  Total         579              235          \n  comm\u2026                                       \n  Cons\u2026                                       \n  Resi\u2026                                       \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  \u2013              17               37          \n  first                                       \n  lien                                        \n  Resi\u2026                                       \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  \u2013               5               12          \n  juni\u2026                                       \n  lien                                        \n  Cred\u2026         294              269          \n  card                                        \n  Auto           79               88          \n  Other          17               18          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  Total         412              424          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  Tota\u2026                                       \n  not      $    991              659          \n  gove\u2026                                       \n  insu\u2026                                       \n                                              \n(1) Represents loans\nwhose repayments are\npredominantly insured\nby the FHA or\nguaranteed by the VA.\nTROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs) When, for\neconomic or legal reasons related to a\nborrower\u2019s financial difficulties, we grant a\nconcession for other than an insignificant\nperiod of time to a borrower that we would not\notherwise consider, the related loan is\nclassified as a TDR, the balance of which\ntotaled $ 9.4billion and $ 10.2billion at June\n30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\nWe do not consider loan resolutions such as\nforeclosure or short sale to be a TDR. In\naddition, COVID-related modifications are\ngenerally not classified as TDRs due to the\nrelief under the CARES Act and the Interagency\nStatement. For additional information on the\nTDR relief, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) in our 2021 Form 10-K. We\nmay require some consumer borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty to make\ntrial payments generally for a period of three\nto four months, according to the terms of a\nplanned permanent modification, to determine\nif they can perform according to those terms.\nThese arrangements represent trial\nmodifications, which we classify and account\nfor as TDRs. While loans are in trial payment\nprograms, their original terms are not\nconsidered modified and they continue to\nadvance through delinquency status and accrue\ninterest according to their original terms.\nCommitments to lend additional funds on loans\nwhose terms have been modified in a TDR\namounted to $ 411million and $ 431million at\nJune 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively.

In\naddition, there may be cases where we have a\ncharge-off/down with no legal principal\nmodification.\n\n(4) Recorded investment related to interest\nrate reduction reflects the effect of reduced\ninterest rates on loans with an interest rate\nconcession as one of their concession types,\nwhich includes loans reported as a principal\nprimary modification type that also have an\ninterest rate concession.\n\n(5) Trial modifications are granted a delay in\npayments due under the original terms during\nthe trial payment period. However, these loans\ncontinue to advance through delinquency status\nand accrue interest according to their\noriginal terms. Any subsequent permanent\nmodification generally includes interest rate\nrelated concessions; however, the exact\nconcession type and resulting financial effect\nare usually not known until the loan is\npermanently modified. Trial modifications for\nthe period are presented net of previously\nreported trial modifications that became\npermanent in the current period.\n                               \n  90    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 4.15 summarizes permanent modification\nTDRs that have defaulted in the current period\nwithin 12 months of their permanent\nmodification date.

various types of on- and off-\nbalance sheet transactions with special\npurpose entities (SPEs), which are\ncorporations, trusts, limited liability\ncompanies or partnerships that are established\nfor a limited purpose. SPEs are often formed\nin connection with securitization transactions\nwhereby financial assets are transferred to an\nSPE. SPEs formed in connection with\nsecuritization transactions are generally\nconsidered variable interest entities (VIEs).\nThe VIE may alter the risk profile of the\nasset by entering into derivative transactions\nor obtaining credit support, and issues\nvarious forms of interests in those assets to\ninvestors. When we transfer financial assets\nfrom our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE\nin connection with a securitization, we\ntypically receive cash and sometimes other\ninterests in the VIE as proceeds for the\nassets we transfer. In certain transactions\nwith VIEs, we may retain the right to service\nthe transferred assets and repurchase the\ntransferred assets if the outstanding balance\nof the assets falls below the level at which\nthe cost to service the assets exceed the\nbenefits. In addition, we may purchase the\nright to service loans transferred to a VIE by\na third party. In connection with our\nsecuritization or other VIE activities, we\nhave various forms of ongoing involvement with\nVIEs, which may include: \u2022 underwriting\nsecurities issued by VIEs and subsequently\nmaking markets in those securities; \u2022\nproviding credit enhancement on securities\nissued by VIEs through the use of letters of\ncredit or financial guarantees; \u2022 entering\ninto other derivative contracts with VIEs; \u2022\nholding senior or subordinated interests in\nVIEs; \u2022 acting as servicer or investment\nmanager for VIEs; \u2022 providing administrative\nor trustee services to VIEs; and \u2022 providing\nseller financing to VIEs. Loan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity We periodically\ntransfer consumer and commercial loans and\nother types of financial assets in\nsecuritization and whole loan sale\ntransactions. MORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S.\nGOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS\nWITH GINNIE MAE In the normal course of\nbusiness we sell originated and purchased\nresidential and commercial mortgage loans to\ngovernment-sponsored entities (GSEs). These\nloans are generally transferred into\nsecuritizations sponsored by the GSEs, which\nprovide certain credit guarantees to investors\nand servicers. We also transfer mortgage loans\ninto securitizations pursuant to Government\nNational Mortgage Association (GNMA)\nguidelines which are insured by the Federal\nHousing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\nMortgage loans eligible for securitization\nwith the GSEs or GNMA are considered\nconforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA design the\nstructure of these securitizations, sponsor\nthe involved VIEs, and have power over the\nactivities most significant to the VIE. We\naccount for loans transferred in conforming\nmortgage loan securitization transactions as\nsales and do not consolidate the VIEs as we\nare not the primary beneficiary. In exchange\nfor the transfer of loans, we typically\nreceive securities issued by the VIEs which we\nsell to third parties for cash or hold for\ninvestment purposes as HTM or AFS securities.\nWe also retain servicing rights on the\ntransferred loans. As a servicer, we retain\nthe option to repurchase loans from GNMA loan\nsecuritization pools, which becomes\nexercisable when three scheduled loan payments\nremain unpaid by the borrower. We repurchased\nloans of $ 564million and $ 1.5billion, during\nthe second quarter and first half of 2022,\nrespectively, and $ 1.0billion and $\n2.9billion during the second quarter and first\nhalf of 2021, respectively, which\npredominantly represented repurchases of\ngovernment insured loans. We recorded assets\nand related liabilities of $ 216million and $\n107million at June 30, 2022, and December 31,\n2021, respectively, where we did not exercise\nour option to repurchase eligible loans. Upon\ntransfers of loans, we also provide\nindemnification for losses incurred due to\nmaterial breaches of contractual\nrepresentations and warranties, as well as\nother recourse arrangements. At June 30, 2022,\nand December 31, 2021, our liability for these\nrepurchase and recourse arrangements was $\n160million and $ 173million, respectively, and\nthe maximum exposure to loss was $ 13.4billion\nand $ 13.3billion at June 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, respectively. Loans\nserviced for others presented in Table 8.3 are\npredominantly loans securitized by the GSEs\nand GNMA. See Note 9 (Mortgage Banking\nActivities) for additional information about\nresidential and commercial servicing rights,\nadvances and servicing fees. Substantially all\nresidential servicing activity is related to\nassets transferred to GSE and GNMA\nsecuritizations. NONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN\nSECURITIZATIONS In the normal course of\nbusiness, we sell nonconforming residential\nand commercial mortgage loans in\nsecuritization transactions that we design and\nsponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan\nsecuritizations do not involve a government\ncredit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial\ninterest holders are subject to credit risk of\nthe underlying assets held by the\nsecuritization VIE. We typically originate the\ntransferred loans, account for the transfers\nas sales and do not consolidate the VIE. We\nalso typically retain the right to service the\nloans and may hold other beneficial interests\nissued by the VIEs, such as debt securities\nheld for investment purposes. Our servicing\nrole related to nonconforming commercial\nmortgage loan securitizations is limited to\nprimary or master servicer and the most\nsignificant decisions impacting the\nperformance of the VIE are generally made by\nthe special servicer or the controlling class\nsecurity holder. For our residential\nnonconforming mortgage loan securitizations\naccounted for as sales, we either do not hold\nvariable interests that we consider\npotentially significant or are not the primary\nservicer for a majority of the VIE assets.\nWHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We also sell\nwhole loans to VIEs where we have continuing\ninvolvement in the form of financing. We\naccount for these transfers as sales, and do\nnot consolidate the VIEs as we do not have the\npower to direct the most significant\nactivities of the VIEs. Table 8.1 presents\ninformation about transfers of assets during\nthe periods presented for which we recorded\nthe transfers as sales and have continuing\ninvolvement with the transferred assets. In\nconnection with these transfers, we received\nproceeds and recorded servicing assets,\nsecurities, and loans. Each of these interests\nare initially measured at fair value.\nServicing rights are classified as Level 3\nmeasurements, and generally securities are\nclassified as Level 2. Substantially all\ntransfers were related to residential mortgage\nsecuritizations with the GSEs or GNMA and\nresulted in nogain or loss because the loans\nare measured at fair\n                               \n  96    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nvalue on a recurring basis.

In resecuritization\ntransactions, we transfer trading debt\nsecurities to VIEs in exchange for new\nbeneficial interests that are sold to third\nparties at or shortly after securitization\nsettlement. This activity is performed for\ncustomers seeking a specific return or risk\nprofile. Substantially all of our transactions\ninvolve the resecuritization of conforming\nmortgage-backed securities issued by the GSEs\nor GNMA. We do not consolidate the\nresecuritization VIEs as we share in the\ndecision-making power with third parties and\ndo not hold significant economic interests in\nthe VIEs other than for market-making\nactivities. We transferred $ 12.6billion and $\n25.3billion of securities to re-securitization\nVIEs during the six months ended June 30, 2022\nand 2021, respectively. These amounts are not\nincluded in Table 8.1. Related total VIE\nassets were $ 117.2billion and $ 117.7billion\nat June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively. As of June 30, 2022 and December\n31, 2021 we held $ 951million and $ 817million\nof securities, respectively. $ 525million and\n$ 915million of these securities related to\nresecuritizations transacted during the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    97  \n                               \nNote 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities (continued)\n\nLoans Serviced for Others Table 8.3 presents\ninformation about loans that we sold or\nsecuritized in which we have ongoing\ninvolvement as servicer. These are primarily\nresidential mortgage loans sold to the GSEs or\nGNMA. Delinquent loans include loans 90 days\nor more past due and loans in bankruptcy,\nregardless of delinquency status. For loans\nsold or securitized where servicing is our\nonly form of continuing involvement, we\ngenerally experience a loss only if we were\nrequired to repurchase a delinquent loan or\nforeclosed asset due to a breach in\nrepresentations and warranties associated with\nour loan sale or servicing contracts.\n\nTable 8.3: Loans Serviced for Others\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      7      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) Includes $ 370million and $ 403million of\ncommercial foreclosed assets and $ 133million\nand $ 129million of residential foreclosed\nassets at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively.\n\n(2) Net charge-offs exclude loans sold to\nFederal National Mortgage Association (FNMA),\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC)\nand GNMA as we do not service or manage the\nunderlying real estate upon foreclosure and,\nas such, do not have access to net charge-off\ninformation.\n\n(3) At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nthe table includes total loans of $\n719.4billion and $ 736.8billion, delinquent\nloans of $ 6.1billion and $ 10.2billion, and\nforeclosed assets of $ 104million and $\n100million, respectively, for FNMA, FHLMC and\nGNMA.\n\nTransactions with Unconsolidated VIEs MORTGAGE\nLOAN SECURITIZATIONS Table 8.4 includes\nnonconforming mortgage loan securitizations\nwhere we originate and transfer the loans to\nthe unconsolidated securitization VIEs that we\nsponsor. For additional information about\nthese VIEs, see the \u201cLoan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity\u201d section within this\nNote. Nonconforming mortgage loan\nsecuritizations also include commercial\nmortgage loan securitizations sponsored by\nthird parties where we did not originate or\ntransfer the loans but serve as master\nservicer and invest in securities that could\nbe potentially significant to the VIE.\nConforming loan securitization and\nresecuritization transactions involving the\nGSEs and GNMA are excluded from Table 8.4\nbecause we are not the sponsor or we do not\nhave power over the activities most\nsignificant to the VIEs. Additionally, due to\nthe nature of the guarantees provided by the\nGSEs and the FHA and VA, our credit risk\nassociated with these VIEs is limited. For\nadditional information about conforming\nmortgage loan securitizations and\nresecuritizations, see the \u201cLoan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity\u201d and \u201cResecuritization\nActivities\u201d sections within this Note. TAX\nCREDIT STRUCTURES We co-sponsor and make\ninvestments in affordable housing projects\nthat are designed to generate a return\nprimarily through the realization of federal\ntax credits. The projects are typically\nmanaged by project sponsors who have the power\nover the VIE\u2019s assets. In some instances, our\ninvestments in these structures may require\nthat we fund future capital commitments at the\ndiscretion of the project sponsors. COMMERCIAL\nREAL ESTATE LOANS We may transfer purchased\nindustrial development bonds and GSE credit\nenhancements to VIEs in exchange for\nbeneficial interests. We may also acquire such\nbeneficial interests in transactions where we\ndo not act as a transferor. We own all of the\nbeneficial interests and may also service the\nunderlying mortgages that serve as collateral\nto the bonds. OTHER VIE STRUCTURES We engage\nin various forms of structured finance\narrangements with other VIEs, including asset-\nbacked finance structures and other\nsecuritizations collateralized by asset\nclasses other than mortgages. Collateral may\ninclude rental properties, asset-backed\nsecurities, student loans and mortgage loans.\nWe may participate in structuring or marketing\nthe arrangements, as well as provide\nfinancing, service one or more of the\nunderlying assets, or enter into derivatives\nwith the VIEs. We may also receive fees for\nthose services. We are not the primary\nbeneficiary of these structures because we do\nnot have power to direct the most significant\nactivities of the VIEs.\n                               \n  98    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 8.4 provides a summary of our exposure\nto the unconsolidated VIEs described above,\nwhich includes investments in securities,\nloans, guarantees, liquidity agreements,\ncommitments and certain derivatives. We\nexclude certain transactions with\nunconsolidated VIEs when our continuing\ninvolvement is temporary or administrative in\nnature or insignificant in size. In Table 8.4,\n\u201cTotal VIE assets\u201d represents the remaining\nprincipal balance of assets held by\nunconsolidated VIEs using the most current\ninformation available. \u201cCarrying value\u201d is the\namount in our consolidated balance sheet\nrelated to our involvement with the\nunconsolidated VIEs. \u201cMaximum exposure to\nloss\u201d is determined as the carrying value of\nour investment in the VIEs excluding the\nunconditional repurchase options that have not\nbeen exercised, plus the remaining undrawn\nliquidity and lending commitments, the\nnotional amount of net written derivative\ncontracts, and generally the notional amount\nof, or stressed loss estimate for, other\ncommitments and guarantees. Debt, guarantees\nand other commitments include amounts related\nto loans sold that we may be required to\nrepurchase, or otherwise indemnify or\nreimburse the investor or insurer for losses\nincurred, due to material breach of\ncontractual representations and warranties as\nwell as other retained recourse arrangements.\nThe maximum exposure to loss for material\nbreach of contractual representations and\nwarranties represents a stressed case estimate\nwe utilize for determining stressed case\nregulatory capital needs and is considered to\nbe a remote scenario. \u201cMaximum exposure to\nloss\u201d represents estimated loss that would be\nincurred under severe, hypothetical\ncircumstances, for which we believe the\npossibility is extremely remote, such as where\nthe value of our interests and any associated\ncollateral declines to zero, without any\nconsideration of recovery or offset from any\neconomic hedges. Accordingly, this disclosure\nis not an indication of expected loss.\nTable 8.4: Unconsolidated VIEs\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Includes $ 196million and $ 352million of\nsecurities classified as trading at June 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\n(2) All other assets includes mortgage\nservicing rights, derivative assets, and other\nassets (predominantly servicing advances).\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    99  \n                               \nNote 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities (continued)\n\nConsolidated VIEs We consolidate VIEs where we\nare the primary beneficiary. We are the\nprimary beneficiary of the following structure\ntypes: COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND\nLEASES We securitize dealer floor plan loans\nand leases in a revolving master trust entity\nand hold the subordinated notes and residual\nequity interests. As servicer and residual\ninterest holder, we control the key decisions\nof the trust and consolidate the entity. The\ntotal VIE assets held by the master trust\nrepresent a majority of the total VIE assets\npresented for this category in Table 8.5. In a\nseparate transaction structure, we also\nprovide the majority of debt and equity\nfinancing to an SPE that engages in lending\nand leasing to specific vendors and service\nthe underlying collateral. OTHER VIE\nSTRUCTURES Other VIEs are primarily related to\nmunicipal tender option bond (MTOB)\ntransactions. MTOBs are vehicles to finance\nthe purchase of municipal bonds through the\nissuance of short-term debt to investors. Our\ninvolvement with MTOBs includes serving as the\nresidual interest holder, which provides\ncontrol over the key decisions of the VIE, as\nwell as the remarketing agent or liquidity\nprovider related to the debt issued to\ninvestors. We may also securitize\nnonconforming mortgage loans, in which our\ninvolvement includes servicer of the\nunderlying assets and holder of subordinate or\nsenior securities issued by the VIE. During\nsecond quarter 2022, we purchased the\noutstanding mortgage loans from the VIEs and\nextinguished the related debt associated with\nsuch securitizations. Table 8.5 presents a\nsummary of financial assets and liabilities of\nour consolidated VIEs. The carrying value\nrepresents assets and liabilities recorded on\nour consolidated balance sheet. Carrying\nvalues of assets are presented using GAAP\nmeasurement methods, which may include fair\nvalue, credit impairment or other adjustments,\nand therefore in some instances will differ\nfrom \u201cTotal VIE assets.\u201d On our consolidated\nbalance sheet, we separately disclose (1) the\nconsolidated assets of certain VIEs that can\nonly be used to settle the liabilities of\nthose VIEs, and (2) the consolidated\nliabilities of certain VIEs for which the VIE\ncreditors do not have recourse to Wells Fargo.\n\nTable 8.5: Transactions with Consolidated VIEs\n                                              \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2013                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n             \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n             \u2014      \u2026      1      \u2014      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      3      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) All other assets includes cash and due\nfrom banks, interest-earning deposits with\nbanks, derivative assets, equity securities,\nand other assets.\n\n(2) All other liabilities includes short-term\nborrowings, derivative liabilities, and\naccrued expenses and other liabilities.\n                                              \n  Other Transactions                          \n                                              \nIn addition to the\ntransactions included\nin the previous\ntables, we have used\nwholly-owned trust\npreferred security\nVIEs to issue debt\nsecurities or\npreferred equity\nexclusively to third-\nparty investors.

The credit risk related to these\nadvances is limited since the reimbursement is\ngenerally senior to cash payments to\ninvestors. We also advance payments of taxes\nand insurance for our owned loans which are\ncollectible from the borrower. We maintain an\nallowance for uncollectible amounts for\nadvances on loans serviced for others that may\nnot be reimbursed if the payments were not\nmade in accordance with applicable servicing\nagreements or if the insurance or servicing\nagreements contain limitations on\nreimbursements. Servicing advances on owned\nloans are charged-off when deemed\nuncollectible.

Carrying value net asset\nposition is a result of certain deferred\npremium option trades.\n(3) Represents recourse provided,\npredominantly to the GSEs, on loans sold under\nvarious programs and arrangements.\n(4) Includes indemnifications provided to\ncertain third-party clearing agents. Estimated\nmaximum exposure to loss was $ 162million and\n$ 216million with related collateral of $\n1.1billion and $ 2.3billion as of June 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\nMaximum exposure to loss represents the\nestimated loss that would be incurred under an\nassumed hypothetical circumstance, despite\nwhat we believe is a remote possibility, where\nthe value of our interests and any associated\ncollateral declines to zero. Maximum exposure\nto loss estimates in Table 11.1 do not reflect\neconomic hedges or collateral we could use to\noffset or recover losses we may incur under\nour guarantee agreements. Accordingly, these\namounts are not an indication of expected\nloss. We believe the carrying value is more\nrepresentative of our current exposure to loss\nthan maximum exposure to loss. The carrying\nvalue represents the fair value of the\nguarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL\nfor guarantees, if applicable. In determining\nthe ACL for guarantees, we consider the credit\nrisk of the related contingent obligation. For\nour guarantees other than written options,\nnon-investment grade represents those\nguarantees on which we have a higher risk of\nperformance under the terms of the guarantee,\nwhich is determined based on an external\nrating or an internal credit grade that is\nbelow investment grade. For written options,\nnon-investment grade represents those\nguarantees where the current intrinsic values\nwould require us to perform under the\ncontract. MERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES We\nprovide debit and credit card transaction\nprocessing services through payment networks\ndirectly for merchants and as a sponsor for\nmerchant processing servicers, including our\njoint venture with a third party that is\naccounted for as an equity method investment.\nIn our role as the merchant acquiring bank, we\nhave a potential obligation in connection with\npayment and delivery disputes between the\nmerchant and the cardholder that are resolved\nin favor of the cardholder, referred to as a\ncharge-back transaction. We estimate our\npotential maximum exposure to be the total\nmerchant transaction volume processed in the\npreceding four months, which is generally the\nlifecycle for a charge-back transaction. As of\nJune 30, 2022, our potential maximum exposure\nwas approximately $ 764.5billion, and related\nlosses, including those from our joint venture\nentity, were insignificant. GUARANTEES OF\nSUBSIDIARIES The Parent fully and\nunconditionally guarantees the payment of\nprincipal, interest, and any other amounts\nthat may be due on securities that its 100%\nowned finance subsidiary, Wells Fargo Finance\nLLC, may issue.These securities are not\nguaranteed by any other subsidiary of the\nParent. The guaranteed liabilities were $\n1.0billion and $ 1.2billion at June 30, 2022\nand December 31, 2021, respectively. These\nguarantees rank on parity with all of the\nParent\u2019s other unsecured and unsubordinated\nindebtedness.\n                                \n  104    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nOTHER COMMITMENTS To\nmeet the financing\nneeds of our\ncustomers, we may\nenter into commitments\nto purchase debt and\nequity securities to\nprovide capital for\ntheir funding,\nliquidity or other\nfuture needs. As of\nboth June 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, we\nhad commitments to\npurchase debt\nsecurities of $\n18million and\ncommitments to\npurchase equity\nsecurities of $\n2.5billion and $\n2.4billion,\nrespectively. As part\nof maintaining our\nmemberships in certain\nclearing\norganizations, we are\nrequired to stand\nready to provide\nliquidity to sustain\nmarket clearing\nactivity in the event\nunforeseen events\noccur or are deemed\nlikely to occur.\nCertain of these\nobligations are\nguarantees of other\nmembers\u2019 performance\nand accordingly are\nincluded in Table 11.1\nin Other guarantees\nand indemnifications.\nAlso, we have\ncommitments to\npurchase loans and\nsecurities under\nresale agreements from\ncertain\ncounterparties,\nincluding central\nclearing\norganizations. The\namount of our unfunded\ncontractual\ncommitments was $\n10.4billion and $\n11.0billion as of June\n30, 2022 and December\n31, 2021,\nrespectively. Given\nthe nature of these\ncommitments, they are\nexcluded from Table\n4.4 (Unfunded Credit\nCommitments) in Note 4\n(Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses).\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    105  \n                                \n                                         \n  Note 12:Pledged Assets and Collateral  \n                                         \nPledged Assets Table 12.1 provides the\ncarrying amount of on-balance sheet pledged\nassets and the fair value of other pledged\ncollateral. Other pledged collateral is\ncollateral we have received from third\nparties, have the right to repledge, have\nrepledged and is not recognized on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. TRADING RELATED\nACTIVITY Our trading businesses may pledge\ndebt and equity securities in connection with\nsecurities sold under agreements to repurchase\n(repurchase agreements) and securities lending\narrangements. The collateral that we pledge\nrelated to our trading activities may include\nour own collateral as well as collateral that\nwe have received from third parties and have\nthe right to repledge. All of the collateral\nwe pledge related to trading activity is\neligible to be repledged or sold by the\nsecured party. NON-TRADING RELATED ACTIVITY As\npart of our liquidity management strategy, we\nmay pledge loans, debt securities, and other\nfinancial assets to secure trust and public\ndeposits, borrowings and letters of credit\nfrom Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (FRB) and for other purposes as\nrequired or permitted by law or insurance\nstatutory requirements. Substantially all of\nthe non-trading activity pledged collateral is\nnot eligible to be repledged or sold by the\nsecured party. VIE RELATED We pledge assets in\nconnection with various types of transactions\nentered into with VIEs. These pledged assets\ncan only be used to settle the liabilities of\nthose entities. We also have loans recorded on\nour consolidated balance sheet which represent\ncertain delinquent loans that are eligible for\nrepurchase from GNMA loan securitizations. See\nNote 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities) for additional information on\nconsolidated VIE assets.\nTable 12.1: Pledged Assets\n                                              \n                     Jun              Dec     \n  (in                30,              31,     \n  mill\u2026              2022             2021    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Rela\u2026                                       \n  to                                          \n  trad\u2026                                       \n  acti\u2026                                       \n  Repl\u2026                                       \n  thir\u2026                                       \n  owned                                       \n  debt     $  34,5\u2026            31,0\u2026          \n  and                                         \n  equi\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Trad\u2026                                       \n  debt                                        \n  secu\u2026       22,7\u2026            14,2\u2026          \n  and                                         \n  other                                       \n  Equi\u2026       1,766              984          \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  pled\u2026                                       \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  rela\u2026       59,0\u2026            46,2\u2026          \n  to                                          \n  trad\u2026                                       \n  acti\u2026                                       \n  Rela\u2026                                       \n  to                                          \n  non-\u2026                                       \n  acti\u2026                                       \n  Loans       299,\u2026            288,\u2026          \n  Debt                                        \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Avai\u2026       64,0\u2026            65,1\u2026          \n  Held\u2026       11,0\u2026            13,8\u2026          \n  Other                                       \n  fina\u2026          42            1,600          \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  pled\u2026                                       \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  rela\u2026       374,\u2026            369,\u2026          \n  to                                          \n  non-\u2026                                       \n  acti\u2026                                       \n  Rela\u2026                                       \n  to                                          \n  VIEs:                                       \n  Cons\u2026                                       \n  VIE         4,709            4,781          \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Loans                                       \n  elig\u2026                                       \n  for                                         \n  repu\u2026         217              109          \n  from                                        \n  GNMA                                        \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  pled\u2026                                       \n  asse\u2026       4,926            4,890          \n  rela\u2026                                       \n  to                                          \n  VIEs                                        \n  Total                                       \n  pled\u2026    $  438,\u2026            420,\u2026          \n  asse\u2026                                       \n                                              \nSecurities Financing Activities We enter into\nresale and repurchase agreements and\nsecurities borrowing and lending agreements\n(collectively, \u201csecurities financing\nactivities\u201d) typically to finance trading\npositions (including securities and\nderivatives), acquire securities to cover\nshort trading positions, accommodate\ncustomers\u2019 financing needs, and settle other\nsecurities obligations. These activities are\nconducted through our broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, through\nother bank entities. Our securities financing\nactivities primarily involve high-quality,\nliquid securities such as U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and government agency securities\nand, to a lesser extent, less liquid\nsecurities, including equity securities,\ncorporate bonds and asset-backed securities.\nWe account for these transactions as\ncollateralized financings in which we\ntypically receive or pledge securities as\ncollateral. We believe these financing\ntransactions generally do not have material\ncredit risk given the collateral provided and\nthe related monitoring processes. OFFSETTING\nOF SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES Table 12.2\npresents resale and repurchase agreements\nsubject to master repurchase agreements (MRA)\nand securities borrowing and lending\nagreements subject to master securities\nlending agreements (MSLA). Collateralized\nfinancings, and those with a single\ncounterparty, are presented net on our\nconsolidated balance sheet, provided certain\ncriteria are met that permit balance sheet\nnetting. The majority of transactions subject\nto these agreements do not meet those criteria\nand thus are not eligible for balance sheet\nnetting. Collateral we pledged consists of\nnon-cash instruments, such as securities or\nloans, and is not netted on the consolidated\nbalance sheet against the related liability.\nCollateral we received includes securities or\nloans and is not recognized on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. Collateral pledged\nor received may be increased or decreased over\ntime to maintain certain contractual\nthresholds, as the assets underlying each\narrangement fluctuate in value. Generally,\nthese agreements require collateral to exceed\nthe asset or liability recognized on\n                                \n  106    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nthe balance sheet. The following table\nincludes the amount of collateral pledged or\nreceived related to exposures subject to\nenforceable MRAs or MSLAs. While these\nagreements are typically over-collateralized,\nU.S. GAAP requires disclosure in this table to\nlimit the reported amount of such collateral\nto the amount of the related recognized asset\nor liability for each counterparty. In\naddition to the amounts included in Table\n12.2, we also have balance sheet netting\nrelated to derivatives that is disclosed in\nNote 14 (Derivatives).\n\nTable 12.2: Offsetting \u2013 Securities Financing\nActivities\n                                              \n                     Jun              Dec     \n  (in                30,              31,     \n  mill\u2026              2022             2021    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Asse\u2026                                       \n  Resa\u2026                                       \n  and                                         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  borr\u2026                                       \n  agre\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026    $  103,\u2026            103,\u2026          \n  reco\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  offs\u2026                                       \n  in          -22,\u2026            -14,\u2026          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (1)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  in                                          \n  cons\u2026       80,7\u2026            89,0\u2026          \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (2)                                         \n  Coll\u2026                                       \n  not                                         \n  reco\u2026                                       \n  in          -80,\u2026            -88,\u2026          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (3)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026    $    634              736          \n  (4)                                         \n  Liab\u2026                                       \n  Repu\u2026                                       \n  and                                         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  lend\u2026                                       \n  agre\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026    $  46,6\u2026            35,0\u2026          \n  reco\u2026                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  offs\u2026                                       \n  in          -22,\u2026            -14,\u2026          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (1)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  in                                          \n  cons\u2026       23,6\u2026            20,9\u2026          \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (5)                                         \n  Coll\u2026                                       \n  pled\u2026                                       \n  but                                         \n  not                                         \n  nett\u2026       -23,\u2026            -20,\u2026          \n  in                                          \n  cons\u2026                                       \n  bala\u2026                                       \n  sheet                                       \n  (6)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amou\u2026    $    224              149          \n  (4)                                         \n                                              \n(1) Represents recognized amount of resale and\nrepurchase agreements with counterparties\nsubject to enforceable MRAs that have been\noffset in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n(2) Includes $ 55.5billion and $ 66.2billion\nclassified on our consolidated balance sheet\nin federal funds sold and securities purchased\nunder resale agreements at June 30, 2022, and\nDecember 31, 2021, respectively.

At June 30, 2022, and December\n31, 2021, we have received total collateral\nwith a fair value of $ 127.7billion and $\n124.4billion, respectively, all of which we\nhave the right to sell or repledge. These\namounts include securities we have sold or\nrepledged to others with a fair value of $\n33.2billion and $ 28.8billion at June 30,\n2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively.\n\n(4) Represents the amount of our exposure\n(assets) or obligation (liabilities) that is\nnot collateralized and/or is not subject to an\nenforceable MRA or MSLA.\n\n(5) Amount is classified in short-term\nborrowings on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n(6) Represents the fair value of collateral we\nhave pledged, related to enforceable MRAs or\nMSLAs, limited in the table above to the\namount of the recognized liability owed to\neach counterparty. At June 30, 2022, and\nDecember 31, 2021, we have pledged total\ncollateral with a fair value of $ 48.0billion\nand $ 35.9billion, respectively, substantially\nall of which may be sold or repledged by the\ncounterparty.\n\nREPURCHASE AND SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements\nand securities lending arrangements are\neffectively short-term collateralized\nborrowings. In these transactions, we receive\ncash in exchange for transferring securities\nas collateral and recognize an obligation to\nreacquire the securities for cash at the\ntransaction\u2019s maturity. These types of\ntransactions create risks, including (1) the\ncounterparty may fail to return the securities\nat maturity, (2) the fair value of the\nsecurities transferred may decline below the\namount of our obligation to reacquire the\nsecurities, and therefore create an obligation\nfor us to pledge additional amounts, and (3)\nthe counterparty may accelerate the maturity\non demand, requiring us to reacquire the\nsecurity prior to contractual maturity. We\nattempt to mitigate these risks in various\nways. Our collateral primarily consists of\nhighly liquid securities. In addition, we\nunderwrite and monitor the financial strength\nof our counterparties, monitor the fair value\nof collateral pledged relative to\ncontractually required repurchase amounts, and\nmonitor that our collateral is properly\nreturned through the clearing and settlement\nprocess in advance of our cash repayment.\nTable 12.3 provides the gross amounts\nrecognized on the consolidated balance sheet\n(before the effects of offsetting) of our\nliabilities for repurchase and securities\nlending agreements disaggregated by underlying\ncollateral type.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    107  \n                                \nNote 12: Pledged Assets and Collateral\n(continued)\n\nTable 12.3: Gross Obligations by Underlying\nCollateral Type\n                                              \n                      Jun              Dec    \n  (in                 30,              31,    \n  mill\u2026               2022             2021   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Repu\u2026                                       \n  agre\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  U.S.                                        \n  Trea\u2026    $  24,460           14,956         \n  and                                         \n  fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  U.S.                                        \n  Stat\u2026           60                1         \n  and                                         \n  poli\u2026                                       \n  subd\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026        4,755            3,432         \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Non-\u2026                                       \n  mort\u2026        1,056              809         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Corp\u2026                                       \n  debt         7,129            8,899         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Asse\u2026          532              358         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Equi\u2026          564              919         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Other          854              409         \n  Total       39,410           29,783         \n  repu\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  lend\u2026                                       \n  arra\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  U.S.                                        \n  Trea\u2026          232               33         \n  and                                         \n  fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026           28               17         \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Corp\u2026                                       \n  debt           149               80         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Equi\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026        6,715            5,050         \n  (1)                                         \n  Other           78               80         \n  Total                                       \n  secu\u2026        7,202            5,260         \n  lend\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  repu\u2026                                       \n  and      $  46,612           35,043         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  lend\u2026                                       \n                                              \n(1) Equity securities are generally exchange\ntraded and represent collateral received from\nthird parties that has been repledged.

These proceedings and\ninvestigations include actions brought against\nWells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries with\nrespect to corporate-related matters and\ntransactions in which Wells Fargo and/or our\nsubsidiaries were involved. In addition, Wells\nFargo and our subsidiaries may be requested to\nprovide information to or otherwise cooperate\nwith government authorities in the conduct of\ninvestigations of other persons or industry\ngroups. We establish accruals for legal\nactions when potential losses associated with\nthe actions become probable and the costs can\nbe reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we\nrecord the amount we consider to be the best\nestimate within a range of potential losses\nthat are both probable and estimable; however,\nif we cannot determine a best estimate, then\nwe record the low end of the range of those\npotential losses. There can be no assurance as\nto the ultimate outcome of legal actions,\nincluding the matters described below, and the\nactual costs of resolving legal actions may be\nsubstantially higher or lower than the amounts\naccrued for those actions. ATM ACCESS FEE\nLITIGATION In October 2011, plaintiffs filed a\nputative class action, Mackmin, et al. v.\nVisa, Inc. et al. , against Wells Fargo &\nCompany, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Visa,\nMasterCard, and several other banks in the\nUnited States District Court for the District\nof Columbia. Plaintiffs allege that the Visa\nand MasterCard requirement that if an ATM\noperator charges an access fee on Visa and\nMasterCard transactions, then that fee cannot\nbe greater than the access fee charged for\ntransactions on other networks, violates\nantitrust rules. Plaintiffs seek treble\ndamages, restitution, injunctive relief, and\nattorneys\u2019 fees where available under federal\nand state law. Two other antitrust cases that\nmake similar allegations were filed in the\nsame court, but these cases did not name Wells\nFargo as a defendant. On February 13, 2013,\nthe district court granted defendants\u2019 motions\nto dismiss the threeactions. Plaintiffs\nappealed the dismissals and, on August 4,\n2015, the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe District of Columbia Circuit vacated the\ndistrict court\u2019s decisions and remanded the\nthreecases to the district court for further\nproceedings. On June 28, 2016, the United\nStates Supreme Court granted defendants\u2019\npetitions for writ of certiorari to review the\ndecisions of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia. On\nNovember 17, 2016, the United States Supreme\nCourt dismissed the petitions as improvidently\ngranted, and the threecases returned to the\ndistrict court for further proceedings. In\nNovember 2021, the district court granted\npreliminary approval of an agreement pursuant\nto which the Company will pay $ 20.8million in\norder to resolve the cases. AUTOMOBILE LENDING\nMATTERS On April 20, 2018, the Company entered\ninto consent orders with the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to\nresolve, among other things, investigations by\nthe agencies into the Company\u2019s compliance\nrisk management program and its past practices\ninvolving certain automobile collateral\nprotection insurance (CPI) policies and\ncertain mortgage interest rate lock\nextensions. The consent orders require\nremediation to customers and the payment of a\ntotal of $ 1.0billion in civil money penalties\nto the agencies. In July 2017, the Company\nannounced a plan to remediate customers who\nmay have been financially harmed due to issues\nrelated to automobile CPI policies purchased\nthrough a third-party vendor on their behalf.\nMultiple putative class actions alleging,\namong other things, unfair and deceptive\npractices relating to these CPI policies, were\nfiled against the Company and consolidated\ninto onemulti-district litigation in the\nUnited States District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California. As previously\ndisclosed, the Company entered into a\nsettlement to resolve the multi-district\nlitigation. Shareholders also filed a putative\nsecurities fraud class action against the\nCompany and its executive officers alleging\nmaterial misstatements and omissions of CPI-\nrelated information in the Company\u2019s public\ndisclosures. In January 2020, the court\ndismissed this action as to all defendants\nexcept the Company and a former executive\nofficer and limited the action to two alleged\nmisstatements. In addition, the Company was\nsubject to a class action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Central District of\nCalifornia alleging that customers were\nentitled to refunds related to the unused\nportion of guaranteed automobile protection\n(GAP) waiver or insurance agreements between\nthe customer and dealer and, by assignment,\nthe lender. As previously disclosed, the\nCompany entered into a settlement to resolve\nthe class action. Allegations related to the\nCPI and GAP programs were among the subjects\nof a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California, which has been\ndismissed. In addition, federal and state\ngovernment agencies, including the CFPB, have\nundertaken formal or informal inquiries,\ninvestigations, or examinations regarding\nthese and other issues related to the\norigination, servicing, and collection of\nconsumer auto loans, including related\ninsurance products. As previously disclosed,\nthe Company entered into an agreement to\nresolve investigations by state attorneys\ngeneral. COMMERCIAL LENDING SHAREHOLDER\nLITIGATION In October and November 2020,\nplaintiffs filed two putative securities fraud\nclass actions, which were consolidated into\nonelawsuit pending in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia alleging that the Company and\ncertain of its current and former officers\nmade false and misleading statements or\nomissions regarding, among other things, the\nCompany\u2019s commercial lending underwriting\npractices, the credit quality of its\ncommercial credit portfolios, and the value of\nits commercial loans, collateralized loan\nobligations and commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities. On May 6, 2022, the district court\ngranted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the\nlawsuit. COMPANY 401(K) PLAN REGULATORY\nINVESTIGATIONS Federal government agencies,\nincluding the United States Department of\nLabor, are reviewing certain transactions\nassociated with the Employee Stock Ownership\nPlan feature of the Company\u2019s 401(k) plan,\nincluding the manner in which the 401(k) plan\npurchased certain securities used in\nconnection with the Company\u2019s contributions to\nthe 401(k) plan. The Company is in resolution\ndiscussions with the Department of Labor,\nalthough there can be no assurance as to the\noutcome of these discussions. CONSENT ORDER\nDISCLOSURE LITIGATION Wells Fargo shareholders\nhave brought a putative securities fraud class\naction\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    109  \n                                \n                                              \n  Note 13:Legal Actions(continued)            \n                                              \nin the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York alleging that\nthe Company and certain of its current and\nformer executive officers and directors made\nfalse or misleading statements regarding the\nCompany\u2019s efforts to comply with the February\n2018 consent order with the Federal Reserve\nBoard and the April 2018 consent orders with\nthe CFPB and OCC. Allegations related to the\nCompany\u2019s efforts to comply with these three\nconsent orders were also among the subjects of\na shareholder derivative lawsuit filed in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California. On February 4, 2022,\nthe district court granted the Company's\nmotion to dismiss the shareholder derivative\nlawsuit. On April 19, 2022, shareholders filed\na new derivative lawsuit in California state\ncourt making similar allegations. CONSUMER\nDEPOSIT ACCOUNT RELATED REGULATORY\nINVESTIGATIONS The CFPB is conducting an\ninvestigation into whether customers were\nunduly harmed by the Company\u2019s historical\npractices associated with the freezing (and,\nin many cases, closing) of consumer deposit\naccounts after the Company detected suspected\nfraudulent activity (by third parties or\naccount holders) that affected those accounts.\nThe CFPB is also investigating certain of the\nCompany\u2019s past disclosures to customers\nregarding the minimum qualifying debit card\nusage required for customers to receive a\nwaiver of monthly service fees on certain\nconsumer deposit accounts. HIRING PRACTICES\nMATTERS Government agencies, including the\nUnited States Department of Justice, have\nundertaken formal or informal inquiries or\ninvestigations regarding the Company\u2019s hiring\npractices related to diversity. A putative\nsecurities fraud class action has also been\nfiled in the United States District Court for\nthe Northern District of California alleging\nthat the Company and certain of its executive\nofficers made false or misleading statements\nabout the Company\u2019s hiring practices related\nto diversity. INTERCHANGE LITIGATION\nPlaintiffs representing a class of merchants\nhave filed putative class actions, and\nindividual merchants have filed individual\nactions, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells\nFargo & Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and\nWachovia Corporation regarding the interchange\nfees associated with Visa and MasterCard\npayment card transactions. Visa, MasterCard,\nand several other banks and bank holding\ncompanies are also named as defendants in\nthese actions. These actions have been\nconsolidated in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of New York.\nThe amended and consolidated complaint asserts\nclaims against defendants based on alleged\nviolations of federal and state antitrust laws\nand seeks damages, as well as injunctive\nrelief. Plaintiff merchants allege that Visa,\nMasterCard, and payment card issuing banks\nunlawfully colluded to set interchange rates.\nPlaintiffs also allege that enforcement of\ncertain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged\ntying and bundling of services offered to\nmerchants are anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and\nWachovia, along with other defendants and\nentities, are parties to Loss and Judgment\nSharing Agreements, which provide that they,\nalong with other entities, will share, based\non a formula, in any losses from the\nInterchange Litigation. On July 13, 2012,\nVisa, MasterCard, and the financial\ninstitution defendants, including Wells Fargo,\nsigned a memorandum of understanding with\nplaintiff merchants to resolve the\nconsolidated class action and reached a\nseparate settlement in principle of the\nconsolidated individual actions. The\nsettlement payments to be made by all\ndefendants in the consolidated class and\nindividual actions totaled approximately $\n6.6billion before reductions applicable to\ncertain merchants opting out of the\nsettlement. The class settlement also provided\nfor the distribution to class merchants of 10\nbasis points of default interchange across all\ncredit rate categories for a period of eight\nconsecutive months. The district court granted\nfinal approval of the settlement, which was\nappealed to the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit by settlement objector\nmerchants. Other merchants opted out of the\nsettlement and are pursuing several individual\nactions. On June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit\nvacated the settlement agreement and reversed\nand remanded the consolidated action to the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York for further proceedings.\nOn November 23, 2016, prior class counsel\nfiled a petition to the United States Supreme\nCourt, seeking review of the reversal of the\nsettlement by the Second Circuit, and the\nSupreme Court denied the petition on March 27,\n2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court\nappointed lead class counsel for a damages\nclass and an equitable relief class. The\nparties have entered into a settlement\nagreement to resolve the money damages class\nclaims pursuant to which defendants will pay a\ntotal of approximately $ 6.2billion, which\nincludes approximately $ 5.3billion of funds\nremaining from the 2012 settlement and $\n900million in additional funding. The\nCompany\u2019s allocated responsibility for the\nadditional funding is approximately $\n94.5million. The court granted final approval\nof the settlement on December 13, 2019, which\nwas appealed to the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit by settlement\nobjector merchants. On September 27, 2021, the\ndistrict court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion\nfor class certification in the equitable\nrelief case. Several of the opt-out and direct\naction litigations have been settled while\nothers remain pending. MORTGAGE LENDING\nMATTERS Plaintiffs representing a class of\nmortgage borrowers filed separate putative\nclass actions alleging that Wells Fargo\nimproperly denied mortgage loan modifications\nor repayment plans to customers in the\nforeclosure process due to the overstatement\nof foreclosure attorneys\u2019 fees that were\nincluded for purposes of determining whether a\ncustomer in the foreclosure process qualified\nfor a mortgage loan modification or repayment\nplan. As previously disclosed, the Company\nentered into settlements to resolve the class\nactions, while the others were voluntarily\ndismissed. In addition, federal and state\ngovernment agencies, including the CFPB, have\nundertaken formal or informal inquiries or\ninvestigations regarding these and other\nmortgage servicing matters. On September 9,\n2021, the OCC assessed a $ 250million civil\nmoney penalty against the Company regarding\nloss mitigation activities in the Company\u2019s\nHome Lending business and insufficient\nprogress in addressing requirements under the\nOCC\u2019s April 2018 consent order. In addition,\non September 9, 2021, the Company entered into\na consent order with the OCC requiring the\nCompany to improve the execution, risk\nmanagement, and oversight of loss mitigation\nactivities in its Home Lending business.\nNOMURA/NATIXIS MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION In\nAugust 2014 and August 2015, Nomura Credit &\nCapital Inc. (Nomura) and Natixis Real Estate\nHoldings, LLC (Natixis) filed a total of\nseventhird-party complaints against Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A., in New York state court. In\nthe underlying first-party actions, Nomura and\nNatixis have been sued for alleged breaches of\nrepresentations and warranties made in\nconnection with residential mortgage-backed\nsecurities sponsored by them. In the third-\nparty actions, Nomura and Natixis allege that\nWells Fargo, as master servicer, primary\nservicer or securities administrator, failed\nto notify Nomura and Natixis of their own\n                                \n  110    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nbreaches, failed to\nproperly oversee the\nprimary servicers, and\nfailed to adhere to\naccepted servicing\npractices. Natixis\nadditionally alleges\nthat Wells Fargo\nfailed to perform\ndefault oversight\nduties. In March 2022,\nWells Fargo entered\ninto an agreement to\nsettle the sixactions\nfiled by Nomura, and\nthe actions have been\nvoluntarily dismissed.\nIn the remaining\naction filed by\nNatixis, Wells Fargo\nhas asserted\ncounterclaims alleging\nthat Natixis failed to\nprovide Wells Fargo\nnotice of its\nrepresentation and\nwarranty breaches.\nOFAC RELATED\nINVESTIGATION The\nCompany has self-\nidentified an issue\nwhereby certain\nforeign banks utilized\na Wells Fargo\nsoftware-based\nsolution to conduct\nimport/export trade-\nrelated financing\ntransactions with\ncountries and entities\nprohibited by the\nOffice of Foreign\nAssets Control (OFAC)\nof the United States\nDepartment of the\nTreasury. We do not\nbelieve any funds\nrelated to these\ntransactions flowed\nthrough accounts at\nWells Fargo as a\nresult of the\naforementioned\nconduct. The Company\nhas made voluntary\nself-disclosures to\nOFAC and has been\ncooperating with\ninvestigations or\ninquiries arising out\nof this matter by\nfederal government\nagencies. The Company\nis in resolution\ndiscussions with\ncertain of these\nagencies, although\nthere can be no\nassurance as to the\noutcome of these\ndiscussions. RETAIL\nSALES PRACTICES\nMATTERS Federal and\nstate government\nagencies, including\nthe United States\nDepartment of Justice\n(Department of\nJustice) and the\nUnited States\nSecurities and\nExchange Commission\n(SEC), have undertaken\nformal or informal\ninquiries or\ninvestigations arising\nout of certain retail\nsales practices of the\nCompany that were the\nsubject of settlements\nwith the CFPB, the\nOCC, and the Office of\nthe Los Angeles City\nAttorney announced by\nthe Company on\nSeptember 8, 2016. On\nFebruary 21, 2020, the\nCompany entered into\nan agreement with the\nDepartment of Justice\nto resolve the\nDepartment of\nJustice\u2019s criminal\ninvestigation into the\nCompany\u2019s retail sales\npractices, as well as\na separate agreement\nto resolve the\nDepartment of\nJustice\u2019s civil\ninvestigation. As part\nof the Department of\nJustice criminal\nsettlement, no charges\nwill be filed against\nthe Company provided\nthe Company abides by\nall the terms of the\nagreement. The\nDepartment of Justice\ncriminal settlement\nalso includes the\nCompany\u2019s agreement\nthat the facts set\nforth in the\nsettlement document\nconstitute sufficient\nfacts for the finding\nof criminal violations\nof statutes regarding\nbank records and\npersonal\ninformation.On\nFebruary 21, 2020, the\nCompany also entered\ninto an order to\nresolve the SEC\u2019s\ninvestigation arising\nout of the Company\u2019s\nretail sales\npractices. The SEC\norder contains a\nfinding, to which the\nCompany consented,\nthat the facts set\nforth include\nviolations of Section\n10(b) of the\nSecurities Exchange\nAct of 1934 and Rule\n10b-5 thereunder.As\npart of the resolution\nof the Department of\nJustice and SEC\ninvestigations, the\nCompany made payments\ntotaling $ 3.0billion.\nThe Company has also\nentered into\nagreements to resolve\nother government\nagency investigations,\nincluding\ninvestigations by the\nstate attorneys\ngeneral. In addition,\na number of lawsuits\nwere filed by non-\ngovernmental parties\nseeking damages or\nother remedies related\nto these retail sales\npractices. As\npreviously disclosed,\nthe Company entered\ninto various\nsettlements to resolve\nthese lawsuits.\n\nRMBS TRUSTEE\nLITIGATION In December\n2014, Phoenix Light SF\nLimited (Phoenix\nLight) and certain\nrelated entities filed\na complaint in the\nUnited States District\nCourt for the Southern\nDistrict of New York\nalleging claims\nagainst Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A., in its\ncapacity as trustee\nfor a number of\nresidential mortgage-\nbacked securities\n(RMBS) trusts.\nComplaints raising\nsimilar allegations\nhave been filed by\nCommerzbank AG in the\nSouthern District of\nNew York and by IKB\nInternational and IKB\nDeutsche Industriebank\nin New York state\ncourt. In each case,\nthe plaintiffs allege\nthat Wells Fargo Bank,\nN.A., as trustee,\ncaused losses to\ninvestors, and\nplaintiffs assert\ncauses of action based\nupon, among other\nthings, the trustee\u2019s\nalleged failure to\nnotify and enforce\nrepurchase obligations\nof mortgage loan\nsellers for purported\nbreaches of\nrepresentations and\nwarranties, notify\ninvestors of alleged\nevents of default, and\nabide by appropriate\nstandards of care\nfollowing alleged\nevents of default. On\nJuly 12, 2022, the\ndistrict court\ndismissed Phoenix\nLight\u2019s claims and\nentered judgment in\nfavor of Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A. The\ndistrict court also\ndismissed certain of\nthe claims asserted by\nCommerzbank AG. The\nCompany previously\nsettled twoclass\nactions filed by\ninstitutional\ninvestors and an\naction filed by the\nNational Credit Union\nAdministration with\nsimilar allegations.\nIn addition, Park\nRoyal I LLC and Park\nRoyal II LLC have\nfiled complaints that\nwere consolidated in\nNew York state court\nalleging Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A., as\ntrustee, failed to\ntake appropriate\nactions upon learning\nof defective mortgage\nloan documentation.\nSEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE\nLITIGATION The\nSeminole Tribe of\nFlorida filed a\ncomplaint in Florida\nstate court alleging\nthat Wells Fargo, as\ntrustee, charged\nexcess fees in\nconnection with the\nadministration of a\nminor\u2019s trust and\nfailed to invest the\nassets of the trust\nprudently. The\ncomplaint was later\namended to include\nthreeindividual\ncurrent and former\nbeneficiaries as\nplaintiffs and to\nremove the Tribe as a\nparty to the case.\nWells Fargo filed a\npetition to remove the\ncase to federal court.\nOUTLOOK As described\nabove, the Company\nestablishes accruals\nfor legal actions when\npotential losses\nassociated with the\nactions become\nprobable and the costs\ncan be reasonably\nestimated. The high\nend of the range of\nreasonably possible\npotential losses in\nexcess of the\nCompany\u2019s accrual for\nprobable and estimable\nlosses was\napproximately $\n3.2billion as of June\n30, 2022. The outcomes\nof legal actions are\nunpredictable and\nsubject to significant\nuncertainties, and it\nis inherently\ndifficult to determine\nwhether any loss is\nprobable or even\npossible. It is also\ninherently difficult\nto estimate the amount\nof any loss and there\nmay be matters for\nwhich a loss is\nprobable or reasonably\npossible but not\ncurrently estimable.\nAccordingly, actual\nlosses may be in\nexcess of the\nestablished accrual or\nthe range of\nreasonably possible\nloss. Based on\ninformation currently\navailable, advice of\ncounsel, available\ninsurance coverage,\nand established\nreserves, Wells Fargo\nbelieves that the\neventual outcome of\nthe actions against\nWells Fargo and/or its\nsubsidiaries will not,\nindividually or in the\naggregate, have a\nmaterial adverse\neffect on Wells\nFargo\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial condition.\nHowever, it is\npossible that the\nultimate resolution of\na matter, if\nunfavorable, may be\nmaterial to Wells\nFargo\u2019s results of\noperations for any\nparticular period.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    111  \n                                \n                       \n  Note 14:Derivatives  \n                       \nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to\nmarket risk, including interest rate risk,\ncredit risk and foreign currency risk, and to\nassist customers with their risk management\nobjectives. We designate certain derivatives\nas hedging instruments in qualifying hedge\naccounting relationships (fair value or cash\nflow hedges). Our remaining derivatives\nconsist of economic hedges that do not qualify\nfor hedge accounting and derivatives held for\ncustomer accommodation trading or other\npurposes.

Table\n14.1 presents the total notional or\ncontractual amounts and fair values for our\nderivatives. Derivative transactions can be\nmeasured in terms of the notional amount, but\nthis amount is not recorded on our\nconsolidated balance sheet and is not, when\nviewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of\nthe risk profile of the instruments.

We also\nenter into futures contracts, forward\ncontracts, and swap contracts to hedge our\nexposure to the price risk of physical\ncommodities included in Other Assets. In\naddition, we use interest rate swaps, cross-\ncurrency swaps, cross-currency interest rate\nswaps and forward contracts to hedge against\nchanges in fair value of certain investments\nin available-for-sale debt securities due to\nchanges in interest rates, foreign currency\nrates, or both. For certain fair value hedges\nof foreign currency risk, changes in fair\nvalue of cross-currency swaps attributable to\nchanges in cross-currency basis spreads are\nexcluded from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and recorded in other\ncomprehensive income (OCI). See Note 21 (Other\nComprehensive Income) for the amounts\nrecognized in other comprehensive income. For\ncash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps\nto hedge the variability in interest payments\nreceived on certain interest-earning deposits\nwith banks and certain floating-rate\ncommercial loans, and interest paid on certain\nfloating-rate debt due to changes in the\ncontractually specified interest rate. We also\nuse cross-currency swaps to hedge variability\nin interest payments on fixed-rate foreign\ncurrency-denominated long-term debt due to\nchanges in foreign exchange rates. We estimate\n$ 107million pre-tax of deferred net losses\nrelated to cash flow hedges in OCI at June 30,\n2022, will be reclassified into net interest\nincome during the next twelve months. For cash\nflow hedges as of June 30, 2022, we are\nhedging our interest rate and foreign currency\nexposure to the variability of future cash\nflows for all forecasted transactions for a\nmaximum of 10years.

The Cash Balance Plan was frozen on\nJuly 1, 2009, and nonew benefits accrue after\nthat date. For additional information on our\npension and postretirement plans, including\nplan assumptions, investment strategy and\nasset allocation, projected benefit payments,\nand valuation methodologies used for assets\nmeasured at fair value, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) and Note 21\n(Employee Benefits and Other Expenses) in our\n2021 Form 10-K. We recognize settlement losses\nfor our Cash Balance Plan based on an\nassessment of whether lump sum benefit\npayments will, in aggregate for the year,\nexceed the sum of its annual service and\ninterest cost (threshold). Settlement losses\nof $ 56million and $ 103million were\nrecognized during the second quarter and first\nhalf of 2022, respectively, compared with $\n62million for both the second quarter and\nfirst half of 2021, representing the pro rata\nportion of the net loss in AOCI based on the\npercentage reduction in the Cash Balance\nPlan\u2019s projected benefit obligation\nattributable to lump sum benefit payments\nduring the first half of both 2022 and 2021.\nAs a result of the settlement losses, we\nremeasured the Cash Balance Plan obligation\nand plan assets as of both June 30, 2022 and\n2021, and used a discount rate of 4.71% and\n2.80%, respectively. In the second quarter and\nfirst half of 2022, respectively, the result\nof the settlement losses and remeasurements\nwas: \u2022 a decrease of $ 120million and $\n110million in the Cash Balance Plan asset; and\n\u2022 a decrease of $ 64million and $ 7million in\nOCI (pre-tax). In both the second quarter and\nfirst half of 2021, the result of the\nsettlement losses and remeasurement was: \u2022 an\nincrease of $ 347million in the Cash Balance\nPlan asset; and \u2022 an increase of $ 409million\nin OCI (pre-tax). Table 18.1 presents the\ncomponents of net periodic benefit cost. The\nexpected long-term rate of return on plan\nassets and interest cost discount rate in\ndetermining net periodic benefit cost for\nsecond quarter 2022 were 5.00% and 3.44%,\nrespectively.

All other business\nactivities that are not included in the\nreportable operating segments have been\nincluded in Corporate. We define our\nreportable operating segments by type of\nproduct and customer segment, and their\nresults are based on our management reporting\nprocess. The management reporting process\nmeasures the performance of the reportable\noperating segments based on the Company\u2019s\nmanagement structure, and the results are\nregularly reviewed by our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Operating Committee. The\nmanagement reporting process is based on U.S.\nGAAP and includes specific adjustments, such\nas funds transfer pricing for asset/liability\nmanagement, shared revenues and expenses, and\ntaxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently\nreflect income from taxable and tax-exempt\nsources, which allows management to assess\nperformance consistently across the operating\nsegments. Consumer Banking and Lending offers\ndiversified financial products and services\nfor consumers and small businesses with annual\nsales generally up to $ 10million. These\nfinancial products and services include\nchecking and savings accounts, credit and\ndebit cards, as well as home, auto, personal,\nand small business lending. Commercial Banking\nprovides financial solutions to private,\nfamily owned and certain public companies.\nProducts and services include banking and\ncredit products across multiple industry\nsectors and municipalities, secured lending\nand lease products, and treasury management.\nCorporate and Investment Banking delivers a\nsuite of capital markets, banking, and\nfinancial products and services to corporate,\ncommercial real estate, government and\ninstitutional clients globally. Products and\nservices include corporate banking, investment\nbanking, treasury management, commercial real\nestate lending and servicing, equity and fixed\nincome solutions, as well as sales, trading,\nand research capabilities. Wealth and\nInvestment Management provides personalized\nwealth management, brokerage, financial\nplanning, lending, private banking, trust and\nfiduciary products and services to affluent,\nhigh-net worth and ultra-high-net worth\nclients. We operate through financial advisors\nin our brokerage and wealth offices, consumer\nbank branches, independent offices, and\ndigitally through WellsTrade \u00ae and Intuitive\nInvestor \u00ae . Corporate includes corporate\ntreasury and enterprise functions, net of\nallocations (including funds transfer pricing,\ncapital, liquidity and certain expenses), in\nsupport of the reportable operating segments,\nas well as our investment portfolio and\naffiliated venture capital and private equity\nbusinesses. In addition, Corporate includes\nall restructuring charges related to our\nefficiency initiatives. See Note 19\n(Restructuring Charges) for additional\ninformation on restructuring charges.\nCorporate also includes certain lines of\nbusiness that management has determined are no\nlonger consistent with the long-term strategic\ngoals of the Company, as well as results for\npreviously divested businesses. Basis of\nPresentation FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING Corporate\ntreasury manages a funds transfer pricing\nmethodology that considers interest rate risk,\nliquidity risk, and other product\ncharacteristics. Operating segments pay a\nfunding charge for their assets and receive a\nfunding credit for their deposits, both of\nwhich are included in net interest income. The\nnet impact of the funding charges or credits\nis recognized in corporate treasury. REVENUE\nAND EXPENSE SHARING When lines of business\njointly serve customers, the line of business\nthat is responsible for providing the product\nor service recognizes revenue or expense with\na referral fee paid or an allocation of cost\nto the other line of business based on\nestablished internal revenue-sharing\nagreements. When a line of business uses a\nservice provided by another line of business\nor enterprise function (included in\nCorporate), expense is generally allocated\nbased on the cost and use of the service\nprovided. TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS\nTaxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-\nexempt income on certain loans and debt\nsecurities are included in net interest\nincome, while taxable-equivalent adjustments\nrelated to income tax credits for low-income\nhousing and renewable energy investments are\nincluded in noninterest income, in each case\nwith corresponding impacts to income tax\nexpense (benefit).

At\nJune 30, 2022, the Bank and our other insured\ndepository institutions were considered well-\ncapitalized under the requirements of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act.\nTable 23.1: Regulatory Capital Information\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n* Denotes the binding ratio under the\nStandardized and Advanced Approaches at June\n30, 2022.\n(1) The SLR consists of tier 1 capital divided\nby total leverage exposure. Total leverage\nexposure consists of total average assets,\nless goodwill and other permitted tier 1\ncapital deductions (net of deferred tax\nliabilities), plus certain off-balance sheet\nexposures.\n(2) The tier 1 leverage ratio consists of tier\n1 capital divided by total average assets,\nexcluding goodwill and certain other items as\ndetermined under the rule.\nAt June 30, 2022, the Common Equity Tier 1\n(CET1), tier 1 and total capital ratio\nrequirements for the Company included a global\nsystemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge\nof 1.50%. The G-SIB surcharge is not\napplicable to the Bank. In addition, the CET1,\ntier 1 and total capital ratio requirements\nfor the Company included a stress capital\nbuffer of 3.10% under the Standardized\nApproach and a capital conservation buffer of\n2.50% under the Advanced Approach. The capital\nratio requirements for the Bank included a\ncapital conservation buffer of 2.50% under\nboth the Standardized and Advanced Approaches.\nThe Company is required to maintain these\nrisk-based capital ratios and to maintain an\nSLR of at least 5.00% (composed of a 3.00%\nminimum requirement plus a supplementary\nleverage buffer of 2.00%) to avoid\nrestrictions on capital distributions and\ndiscretionary bonus payments. The Bank is\nrequired to maintain an SLR of at least 6.00%\nto be considered well-capitalized under\napplicable regulatory capital adequacy rules.\nCapital Planning Requirements The FRB\u2019s c\napital plan rule establishes capital planning\nand other requirements that govern capital\ndistributions, including dividends and share\nrepurchases, by certain large bank holding\ncompanies (BHCs), including Wells Fargo. The\nFRB conducts an annual Comprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review exercise and has also\npublished guidance regarding its supervisory\nexpectations for capital planning, including\ncapital policies regarding the process\nrelating to common stock dividend and\nrepurchase decisions in the FRB\u2019s SR Letter\n15-18. The Parent\u2019s ability to make certain\ncapital distributions is subject to the\nrequirements of the capital plan rule and is\nalso subject to the Parent meeting or\nexceeding certain regulatory capital minimums.\n                                \n  140    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nLoan and Dividend\nRestrictions Federal\nlaw restricts the\namount and the terms\nof both credit and\nnon-credit\ntransactions between a\nbank and its nonbank\naffiliates.\nAdditionally, federal\nlaws and regulations\nlimit the dividends\nthat a national bank\nmay pay. Our nonbank\nsubsidiaries are also\nlimited by certain\nfederal and state\nstatutory provisions\nand regulations\ncovering the amount of\ndividends that may be\npaid in any given\nyear. In addition,\nunder a Support\nAgreement dated June\n28, 2017, as amended\nand restated on June\n26, 2019, among Wells\nFargo & Company, the\nparent holding company\n(the \u201cParent\u201d), WFC\nHoldings, LLC, an\nintermediate holding\ncompany and subsidiary\nof the Parent (the\n\u201cIHC\u201d), Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A., Wells\nFargo Securities, LLC,\nWells Fargo Clearing\nServices, LLC, and\ncertain other\nsubsidiaries of the\nParent designated from\ntime to time as\nmaterial entities for\nresolution planning\npurposes or identified\nfrom time to time as\nrelated support\nentities in our\nresolution plan, the\nIHC may be restricted\nfrom making dividend\npayments to the Parent\nif certain liquidity\nand/or capital metrics\nfall below defined\ntriggers or if the\nParent\u2019s board of\ndirectors authorizes\nit to file a case\nunder the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code.
