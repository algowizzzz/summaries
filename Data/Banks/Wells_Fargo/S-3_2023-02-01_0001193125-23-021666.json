Each time we sell\nsecurities, we will provide a prospectus\nsupplement that will contain specific\ninformation about the terms of that\noffering. Such prospectus supplement may also\nadd, update or change information contained in\nthis prospectus. You should read this\nprospectus and the applicable prospectus\nsupplement together with the additional\ninformation described under the\nsection entitled \u0093Where You Can Find More\nInformation.\u0094 We may also prepare free writing\nprospectuses that describe particular\nsecurities. Any free writing prospectus should\nalso be read in connection with this\nprospectus and with any\nprospectus supplement referred to therein. For\npurposes of this prospectus, any reference to\nan applicable prospectus supplement may also\nrefer to a free writing prospectus, unless the\ncontext otherwise requires.\n\nWhen we refer to \u0093,\u0094 \u0093,\u0094 \u0093,\u0094 \u0093\u0094 and\n\u0093\u0094 in this prospectus under the section\nentitled \u0093The Company,\u0094 we mean Wells Fargo &\nCompany and its subsidiaries unless the\ncontext indicates otherwise. When such terms\nare used elsewhere in this prospectus,\nwe refer only to Wells Fargo & Company unless\nthe context indicates otherwise.\n\nThe registration statement that contains this\nprospectus, including the exhibits to the\nregistration statement, contains additional\ninformation about us and the securities\noffered under this prospectus. That\nregistration statement can be read at the SEC\nwebsite mentioned under the section\nentitled \u0093Where You Can Find More\nInformation.\u0094\n\nThe distribution of this prospectus and the\napplicable prospectus supplement\nand the offering of the securities in certain\njurisdictions may be restricted by law.\nPersons into whose possession this prospectus\nand the applicable prospectus supplement come\nshould inform themselves about and observe any\nsuch restrictions. This\nprospectus and the applicable prospectus\nsupplement do not constitute, and may not be\nused in connection with, an offer or\nsolicitation by anyone in any jurisdiction in\nwhich such offer or solicitation is not\nauthorized or in which the person making\nsuch offer or solicitation is not qualified to\ndo so or to any person to whom it is unlawful\nto make such offer or solicitation.\n\n1\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nYour investment in our securities involves\nrisks. This prospectus does not describe all\nof those risks. Before purchasing any\nsecurities, you\nshould carefully consider the following risk\nfactors, in addition to the other information\ncontained or incorporated by reference in this\nprospectus, including the risk factors\ncontained in our annual and quarterly reports.\nAdditional risks specific to particular\nsecurities will be detailed in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. You should consult your\nfinancial, legal, tax and other professional\nadvisors as to the risks associated with an\ninvestment in our securities and the\nsuitability of the investment for you.\n\nRisks Relating To Our Securities Generally\n\nThe Securities Are Subject To The Credit Risk\nOf Wells Fargo.\n\nAny securities that we may issue are our\nobligations and are not, either directly or\nindirectly, an obligation of any third party.\nAny\namounts payable under any securities are\nsubject to our creditworthiness. As a result,\nour actual and perceived creditworthiness may\naffect the value of our securities and, in the\nevent we were to default on our obligations,\nyou may not receive any\namounts owed to you under the terms of such\nsecurities.\n\nThe Securities May Not Be Listed On Any\nSecurities Exchange And An Active Trading\nMarket For The Securities May Not Develop.\n\nAny securities that we issue will constitute a\nnew issue of securities with no\nestablished trading market. The securities may\nnot be listed or displayed on any securities\nexchange or any automated quotation system.\nEven if the securities are listed on a\nsecurities exchange or automated quotation\nsystem, such listing does not\nguarantee that a trading market will develop.\nAlthough underwriters, dealers or agents, as\napplicable, may purchase our securities from\nyou, they are not obligated to do so and are\nnot required to make a market for our\nsecurities. As such, there can\nbe no assurance that a secondary market will\ndevelop. Because we do not expect that any\nmarket makers will participate in a secondary\nmarket for our securities, the price at which\nyou may be able to sell your securities is\nlikely to depend on the\nprice, if any, at which an underwriter, dealer\nor agent, as applicable, is willing to buy\nyour securities. If a secondary market does\nexist, it may be limited. Accordingly, there\nmay be a limited number of buyers if you\ndecide to sell your\nsecurities, and no assurance can be given as\nto the liquidity of any trading market for the\nsecurities or the price you receive upon a\nsale of your securities.\n\nOne Of Our Affiliates May Act As The\nCalculation Agent With Respect To Our\nSecurities And, As A Result, Potential\nConflicts Of Interest Could Arise.\n\nOne of our affiliates may act as the\ncalculation agent with respect to our\nsecurities. Although any affiliate will\nexercise its judgment in good faith when\nperforming its functions, potential conflicts\nof interest may exist between such affiliate\nand you.\n\nIf The Securities We Issue May Be Redeemed At\nOur Option, You May Not Be Able To Reinvest\nThe Redemption Price You Receive In A Similar\nSecurity.\n\nThe terms of our securities may permit us to\nredeem the securities, subject to any required\nregulatory approval. Any such\nredemption may occur at a time when prevailing\ninterest rates are relatively low. As a\nresult, if we redeem our securities, you may\nnot be able to reinvest the redemption price\nyou receive in a similar security.\n\n2\n\nRisks Relating To Our Debt Securities\nGenerally\n\nOur Ability To Service Our Debt, Including Our\nDebt Securities, May Be Limited By The Results\nOf Operations Of Our Subsidiaries And Certain\nContractual Arrangements.\n\nWe conduct substantially all of our activities\nand operations through our subsidiaries and\nare a\nseparate and distinct legal entity from those\nsubsidiaries. We receive substantially all of\nour funding and liquidity from dividends,\nloans and other distributions from our\nsubsidiaries. We generally use these funds,\namong other sources, to satisfy\nour financial obligations, including principal\nand interest on our debt. In addition to\nlimitations under laws and regulations\napplicable to us and our subsidiaries (as\ndiscussed below), funds available to us from\nour subsidiaries will be contingent\nupon the financial performance and condition\nof those subsidiaries. Adverse business or\neconomic conditions, such as changes in\ninterest rates and financial market values,\ncould affect the businesses and the results of\noperations of our subsidiaries\nand, therefore, adversely affect the sources\nof funds available to us.\n\nIn addition, our right to participate in a\ndistribution of assets\nupon a subsidiary\u0092s liquidation or\nreorganization, and thus the ability of a\nholder of our debt securities to benefit\nindirectly from such distributions, is subject\nto the prior claims of the subsidiary\u0092s\ncreditors. This subordination of\ncreditors of a parent company to prior claims\nof creditors of its subsidiaries is commonly\nreferred to as structural subordination.\nFurthermore, our rights as a creditor of our\nsubsidiaries may be subordinate to any\nsecurity interest in the assets\nof those subsidiaries and any obligations of\nthose subsidiaries senior to those held by us.\n\nAs discussed further below, federal banking\nregulators require measures to facilitate the\ncontinued operation of operating subsidiaries\nnotwithstanding the failure of their parent\ncompanies, and our ability to receive funds\nfrom our subsidiaries may be limited by the\nSupport Agreement\ndiscussed in the following risk factors.\nFurther, dividend payments to us from our\nsubsidiaries may also be restricted if\nspecified liquidity and/or capital metrics\nfall below defined triggers or if our board of\ndirectors authorizes us to file a\ncase under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n\nThe Resolution Of Wells Fargo Under The\nOrderly Liquidation Authority Could Result In\nGreater Losses For Holders Of Our Debt\nSecurities, Particularly If A Single-Point-Of-\nEntry StrategyIs Used.\n\nYour ability to recover the full amount that\nwould otherwise be payable on our debt\nsecurities in a proceeding under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code\nmay be impaired by the exercise by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (the \u0093\u0094) of its\npowers under the \u0093orderly liquidation\nauthority\u0094 under Title II of the Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection\nAct (the \u0093\u0094). In particular, the single point\nof entry strategy described below is intended\nto impose losses at the top-tier holding\ncompany level in the resolution of\na Global Systemically Important Bank (\u0093\u0094) such\nas Wells Fargo.\n\nTitle II of\nthe Dodd-Frank Act created a new resolution\nregime known as the \u0093orderly liquidation\nauthority\u0094 to which financial companies,\nincluding bank holding companies such as Wells\nFargo, can be subjected. Under the orderly\nliquidation authority,\nthe FDIC may be appointed as receiver for a\nfinancial company for purposes of liquidating\nthe entity if, upon the recommendation of the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (the \u0093\u0094) and the FDIC, the United\nStates\nSecretary of the Treasury determines, among\nother things, that the entity is in severe\nfinancial distress, that the entity\u0092s failure\nwould have serious adverse effects on the U.S.\nfinancial system and that resolution under the\norderly\nliquidation authority would avoid or mitigate\nthose effects. Absent such determinations,\nWells Fargo, as a bank holding company, would\nremain subject to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n\nIf the FDIC is appointed as receiver under the\norderly liquidation authority, then the\norderly liquidation authority, rather than the\nU.S.\nBankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of\nthe receiver and the\n\n3\n\nrights and obligations of creditors and other\nparties who have transacted with Wells Fargo.\nThere are substantial differences between the\nrights available to creditors in the orderly\nliquidation\nauthority and under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,\nincluding the right of the FDIC under the\norderly liquidation authority to disregard the\nstrict priority of creditor claims in some\ncircumstances (which would otherwise be\nrespected by a bankruptcy\ncourt) and the use of an administrative claims\nprocedure to determine creditors\u0092 claims (as\nopposed to the judicial procedure utilized in\nbankruptcy proceedings). In certain\ncircumstances under the orderly liquidation\nauthority, the FDIC could\nelevate the priority of claims if it\ndetermines that doing so is necessary to\nfacilitate an orderly liquidation without the\nneed to obtain the consent of other creditors\nor prior court review. In addition, under the\norderly liquidation authority,\nthe FDIC has the right to transfer assets or\nliabilities of the failed company to a third\nparty or \u0093bridge\u0094 entity.\n\nThe FDIC\nhas indicated that a \u0093single point of entry\u0094\nstrategy may be a desirable strategy to\nresolve a large financial institution such as\nWells Fargo in a manner that would, among\nother things, impose losses on shareholders,\nunsecured debt\nholders (including, in our case, holders of\nour debt securities) and other creditors of\nthe top-tier holding company (in our case,\nWells Fargo), while permitting the holding\ncompany\u0092s\nsubsidiaries to continue to operate. In\naddition, in December 2016, the FRB finalized\nrules requiring U.S. G-SIBs, including Wells\nFargo, to maintain minimum amounts of long-\nterm debt and total loss\nabsorbing capacity (TLAC). It is possible that\nthe application of the single point of entry\nstrategy\u0097in which Wells Fargo would be the\nonly legal entity to enter resolution\nproceedings\u0097could result in greater losses to\nholders of our debt\nsecurities than the losses that would result\nfrom a different resolution strategy for Wells\nFargo. Assuming Wells Fargo entered resolution\nproceedings and that support from Wells Fargo\nto its subsidiaries was sufficient to enable\nthe subsidiaries to\nremain solvent, losses at the subsidiary level\ncould be transferred to Wells Fargo and\nultimately borne by Wells Fargo\u0092s security\nholders (including holders of our unsecured\ndebt securities), with the result that third-\nparty creditors of Wells\nFargo\u0092s subsidiaries would receive full\nrecoveries on their claims, while Wells\nFargo\u0092s security holders (including holders of\nour debt securities) and other unsecured\ncreditors could face significant losses. In\naddition, holders of our\ndebt securities could face losses ahead of our\nother similarly situated creditors in a\nresolution under the orderly liquidation\nauthority if the FDIC exercised its right,\ndescribed above, to disregard the strict\npriority of creditor claims.\n\nThe orderly liquidation authority also\nrequires that creditors and shareholders of\nthe financial company in receivership must\nbear all losses\nbefore taxpayers are exposed to any losses,\nand amounts owed by the financial company or\nthe receivership to the U.S. government would\ngenerally receive a statutory payment priority\nover the claims of private creditors,\nincluding senior creditors\nsuch as claims in respect of our debt\nsecurities. In addition, under the orderly\nliquidation authority, claims of creditors\n(including holders of our debt securities)\ncould be satisfied through the issuance of\nequity or other securities in a bridge\nentity to which Wells Fargo\u0092s assets are\ntransferred. If securities were to be\ndelivered in satisfaction of claims, there can\nbe no assurance that the value of the\nsecurities of the bridge entity would be\nsufficient to repay all or any part of\nthe creditor claims for which the securities\nwere exchanged.\n\nWhile the FDIC has issued regulations to\nimplement the orderly liquidation\nauthority, not all aspects of how the FDIC\nmight exercise this authority are known and\nadditional rulemaking is possible.\n\nThe Resolution Of Wells Fargo In A Bankruptcy\nProceeding Could Also Result in Greater Losses\nFor Holders Of Our Debt Securities.\n\nAs\nrequired by the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations\nissued by the FRB and the FDIC, we are\nrequired to periodically provide to the FRB\nand the FDIC a plan for our rapid and orderly\nresolution in the event of material financial\ndistress affecting Wells\nFargo or the failure of Wells Fargo. The\nstrategy described in our resolution plan is a\nsingle point of entry strategy, in which Wells\nFargo would be resolved under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code using a strategy in which only\nWells Fargo itself enters\nbankruptcy proceedings while some or all of\nits operating subsidiaries are maintained as\ngoing concerns. In this case, the effects on\ncreditors of Wells Fargo would likely be\nsimilar to those arising under the orderly\nliquidation authority, as\ndescribed above. We are\n\n4\n\nnot obligated to maintain a single point of\nentry strategy, and the strategy reflected in\nour resolution plan submission is not binding\nin the event of an actual resolution of Wells\nFargo,\nwhether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode or by the FDIC under the orderly\nliquidation authority. To carry out a single\npoint of entry strategy, Wells Fargo may seek\nto recapitalize its subsidiaries or provide\nthem with liquidity in order to\npreserve them as going concerns prior to the\ncommencement of Wells Fargo\u0092s bankruptcy\nproceeding. Moreover, Wells Fargo could seek\nto elevate the priority of its guarantee\nobligations relating to its major\nsubsidiaries\u0092 derivatives\ncontracts over its other obligations, so that\ncross-default and early termination rights\nunder derivatives contracts at its\nsubsidiaries would be stayed under the ISDA\nResolution Stay Protocol. This elevation would\nresult in holders of our debt\nsecurities incurring losses ahead of the\nbeneficiaries of those guarantee obligations.\nIt is also possible that holders of our debt\nsecurities could incur losses ahead of other\nsimilarly situated creditors.\n\nIn response to the regulators\u0092 guidance and to\nfacilitate the orderly resolution of Wells\nFargo, we entered into an intercompany support\nagreement with WFC Holdings, LLC, an\nintermediate holding company and subsidiary of\nWells Fargo (the \u0093\u0094), Wells Fargo Bank,\nNational Association (\u0093\u0094), Wells Fargo\nSecurities, LLC (\u0093\u0094),\nWells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC (\u0093\u0094) and\ncertain of our other subsidiaries (the \u0093\u0094).\nPursuant to the Support Agreement, Wells Fargo\ntransferred a significant amount of its\nassets, including\namong other things, cash and liquid\nsecurities, to the IHC and will continue to\ntransfer such assets to the IHC from time to\ntime. In the event of Wells Fargo\u0092s material\nfinancial distress or failure, the IHC will be\nobligated to use the\ntransferred assets to provide capital and/or\nliquidity to certain key subsidiaries in order\nto help ensure their continued operations.\nWells Fargo and the IHC\u0092s respective\nobligations under the Support Agreement are\nsecured pursuant to a\nrelated security agreement. In the ordinary\ncourse, the IHC will provide Wells Fargo with\nfunding under the Support Agreement through\nsubordinated notes and a committed line of\ncredit, which, together with dividend\npayments, is expected to provide\nWells Fargo, during business as usual\noperating conditions, with the same access to\ncash necessary to service its debts, pay\ndividends, repurchase its shares and perform\nits other obligations as it would have if it\nhad not entered into these\narrangements and transferred any assets. If\ncertain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall\nbelow triggers specified in the Support\nAgreement, the subordinated notes would be\nforgiven and the committed line of credit\nwould be terminated. Dividend\npayments to us from our subsidiaries may also\nbe restricted if specified liquidity and/or\ncapital metrics fall below defined triggers or\nif our board of directors authorizes us to\nfile a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nThe forgiveness of\nsubordinated notes, termination of the\ncommitted line of credit or restrictions on\ndividend payments to us from our subsidiaries\ncould materially and adversely affect our\nability to satisfy our obligations, including\nany payments to holders of our\ndebt securities, and could result in the\ncommencement of bankruptcy proceedings by\nWells Fargo at an earlier time than might have\notherwise occurred if the Support Agreement\nwere not implemented. If the single point of\nentry strategy\u0097the\npreferred strategy for our rapid and orderly\nresolution\u0097proves to be unsuccessful,\nmultiple, competing resolution proceedings\ncould ensue and holders of our debt securities\nmay as a consequence be in a worse position\nthan if the strategy had\nnot been effectuated. In all cases, any\npayments to holders of our debt securities are\ndependent on our ability to make such payments\nand are therefore subject to our credit risk.\n\nHolders Of Our Senior Debt Securities Have\nLimited Rights Of Acceleration.\n\nPayment of principal on our senior debt\nsecurities may be accelerated only in the case\nof payment defaults that continue for a period\nof\n30 days or certain events of bankruptcy or\ninsolvency, whether voluntary or involuntary.\nIf you purchase a series of senior debt\nsecurities, you will have no right to\naccelerate the payment of principal on that\nseries of senior debt securities\nif we fail in the performance of any of our\nobligations under that series of senior debt\nsecurities, other than the obligations to pay\nprincipal and interest on that series of\nsenior debt securities. See \u0093Description of\nDebt\nSecurities\u0097Events of Default and Covenant\nBreaches.\u0094\n\n5\n\nHolders Of Our Subordinated Debt Securities\nHave Even More Limited Rights Of Acceleration.\n\nPayment of principal on our subordinated debt\nsecurities may be accelerated only in the case\nof certain events of\nbankruptcy or insolvency, whether voluntary or\ninvoluntary. If you purchase a series of\nsubordinated debt securities, you will have no\nright to accelerate the payment of principal\non that series of subordinated debt securities\nif we fail to pay\nprincipal or interest on that series of\nsubordinated debt securities or if we fail in\nthe performance of any of our other\nobligations under that series of subordinated\ndebt securities. Further, if certain payment\ndefaults occur, holders of senior\ndebt securities may be able to accelerate\ntheir debt securities so that such debt\nsecurities become immediately due and payable\nwhile holders of subordinated debt securities\nwill be unable to do so. In such an event, our\nobligation to repay the\naccelerated senior debt securities in full\ncould adversely affect our ability to make\ntimely payments on subordinated debt\nsecurities thereafter. See \u0093Description of\nDebt Securities\u0097Subordination.\u0094\n\nIf We Become Insolvent, Holders Of Our Senior\nDebt Securities May Receive More Than Holders\nOf Our Subordinated Debt Securities.\n\nAny subordinated debt securities we may issue\npursuant to this prospectus and any prospectus\nsupplement are unsecured and rank junior to\nour\nSenior Debt, as defined herein under\n\u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities\u0097Subordination.\u0094 If certain events\nin bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization\noccur, we will first pay all Senior Debt,\nincluding any interest accrued after the\nevents occur, in full before we make any\npayment or distribution on account of\nprincipal of or interest on any subordinated\ndebt securities, and there is no limitation on\nour ability to incur additional debt senior to\nor on parity with any\nsubordinated debt securities. If we become\ninsolvent, holders of the Senior Debt may\nreceive more, ratably, and holders of the\nsubordinated debt securities having a claim\npursuant to those debt securities may receive\nless, ratably, than our other\ncreditors. In addition, holders of our debt\nsecurities may be fully subordinated to\ninterests held by the U.S. government in the\nevent that we enter into a receivership,\ninsolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding.\n\nHolders Of Our Debt Securities Could Be At\nGreater Risk For Being Structurally\nSubordinated If We Convey, Transfer Or Lease\nAll Or Substantially All Of Our Assets To One\nOr More Of Our Subsidiaries.\n\nUnder our indentures, we may convey, transfer\nor lease all or\nsubstantially all of our assets to one or more\nof our subsidiaries. In that event, third-\nparty creditors of our subsidiaries would have\nadditional assets from which to recover on\ntheir claims while holders of our debt\nsecurities would be\nstructurally subordinated to creditors of our\nsubsidiaries with respect to such assets. See\n\u0093Description of Debt Securities\u0097Consolidation,\nMerger or Sale.\u0094\n\nRisks Relating To SOFR, Compounded SOFR And A\nBenchmark Replacement\n\nThe following risk factors apply to debt\nsecurities for which the base rate is\nCompounded SOFR (referred to as \u0093\u0094).\nReferences to \u0093our designee\u0094 in this\nprospectus shall mean the calculation agent.\nCapitalized terms used under this section\n\u0093\u0097Risks Relating To SOFR, Compounded SOFR And\nA Benchmark Replacement\u0094 are defined\nunder \u0093Description of Debt Securities\u0097Floating\nRate Debt Securities\u0097Base Rates\u0097Compounded\nSOFR Notes.\u0094\n\nSOFR Has A Limited History; The Future\nPerformance of SOFR Cannot Be Predicted Based\nOn Historical Performance.\n\nThe publication of the\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (\u0093\u0094) began on\nApril 3, 2018, and it therefore has a limited\nhistory. In addition, the future performance\nof SOFR cannot be predicted based on the\nlimited historical performance. The level of\nSOFR, which will be used to calculate\nCompounded SOFR, may\n\n6\n\nbear little or no relation to the historical\nlevel of SOFR. Prior observed patterns, if\nany, in the behavior of market variables, such\nas correlations, may change in the future.\nWhile pre-publication indicative historical\ndata has been released by the Federal Reserve\nBank of New York, such analysis inherently\ninvolves assumptions, estimates and\napproximations. The future performance of SOFR\nis\nimpossible to predict and therefore no future\nperformance of SOFR or Compounded SOFR notes\nmay be inferred from any of the historical\nsimulations or historical performance.\nHypothetical or historical performance data\nare not indicative of, and have\nno bearing on, the potential performance of\nSOFR or Compounded SOFR notes.\n\nAny Failure Of SOFR To Maintain Market\nAcceptance Could Adversely Affect Compounded\nSOFR Notes.\n\nSOFR is a relatively new rate and may fail to\nmaintain market acceptance. SOFR was developed\nfor use in certain U.S. Dollar derivatives and\nother financial contracts as an alternative to\nU.S. Dollar LIBOR in part because it is\nconsidered a good representation of general\nfunding conditions in the overnight Treasury\nrepo market.\nHowever, as a rate based on transactions\nsecured by U.S. Treasury securities, it does\nnot measure bank-specific credit risk and, as\na result, is less likely to correlate with the\nunsecured short-term funding costs of banks.\nThis may mean that market\nparticipants would not consider SOFR a\nsuitable substitute or successor for all of\nthe purposes for which LIBOR historically has\nbeen used (including, without limitation, as a\nrepresentation of the unsecured short-term\nfunding costs of banks), which\nmay, in turn, lessen market acceptance of\nSOFR. Any failure of SOFR to gain market\nacceptance could adversely affect the value of\nand the return on Compounded SOFR notes and\nthe price at which you can sell Compounded\nSOFR notes.\n\nThe Interest Rate On Compounded SOFR Notes Is\nBased On A Daily Compounded SOFR Rate, Which\nIs Relatively New In The Marketplace.\n\nFor each interest period for which the debt\nsecurities bear interest at a floating rate\nbased on Compounded SOFR, the interest rate on\nCompounded SOFR notes is based on a daily\ncompounded SOFR rate calculated using the\nspecific formula described in this prospectus,\nnot the SOFR rate published on or in respect\nof a particular date during the related\nobservation period, an average of\nSOFR rates during such period or the SOFR\nIndex. For this and other reasons, the\ninterest rate on Compounded SOFR notes during\nany observation period will not be the same as\nthe interest rate on other SOFR-linked\ninvestments that use an alternative\nbasis to determine the applicable interest\nrate. Further, if the SOFR rate in respect of\na particular date during an observation period\nis negative, the inclusion of such SOFR rate\nto determine Compounded SOFR for the related\ninterest period will\nreduce the interest rate payable on such\nCompounded SOFR notes on the related interest\npayment date; provided that in no event will\nthe interest payable for any interest period\nfor which any debt securities bear interest at\na floating rate based on\nCompounded SOFR be less than zero.\n\nIn addition, the method for calculating an\ninterest rate based on Compounded SOFR in\nmarket precedent\nvaries. Variation in the market based on\npayment delays, observation periods, lookbacks\nand/or lockout/suspension periods could\nadversely affect the return on, value of and\nmarket for Compounded SOFR notes.\n\nThe Amount Of Interest Payable With Respect To\nEach Interest Period Will Be Determined Near\nThe End Of The Interest Period.\n\nThe level of the base rate applicable to each\ninterest period for which the debt securities\nbear interest at a floating rate based on\nCompounded SOFR and, therefore, the amount of\ninterest payable with respect to such interest\nperiod will be determined near the end of such\ninterest period. Therefore, you will not know\nthe amount of interest payable with respect to\neach such\ninterest period until shortly prior to the\nrelated interest payment date and it may be\ndifficult for you to reliably estimate the\namount of interest that will be payable on\neach such interest payment date. This\ninability to estimate the amount of\ninterest payable on an interest payment date\nmay cause some investors to be unwilling or\nunable to trade in Compounded SOFR notes,\nwhich could\n\n7\n\nadversely impact the liquidity and value of\nCompounded SOFR notes. In addition, with\nrespect to the final interest period, holders\nof Compounded SOFR notes will not benefit from\nany increase in\nthe level of SOFR that occurs between the\nfinal day of the observation period related to\nsuch interest period and the maturity date.\n\nThe Composition And Characteristics of SOFR\nAre Not The Same As Those Of LIBOR.\n\nIn June 2017, the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork\u0092s Alternative Reference Rates Committee\nannounced SOFR as its recommended alternative\nto U.S. Dollar LIBOR. However, the composition\nand characteristics of SOFR are not the same\nas those of LIBOR. SOFR is a broad Treasury\nrepo financing rate that represents overnight\nsecured funding transactions. This means that\nSOFR differs\nfrom LIBOR (or any other alternative reference\nrate to LIBOR) in key respects. For example,\nSOFR is a secured overnight rate that does not\nembed a credit risk premium, while LIBOR is an\nunsecured rate that includes an interbank\nfunding premium. In\naddition, because SOFR is a transaction-based\nrate, it is backward-looking and Compounded\nSOFR is the compounded average of daily SOFRs\ncalculated in arrears while LIBOR is a\nforward-looking rate that is published with\ndifferent maturities that\nrepresents interbank funding over different\nmaturities. As a result, there can be no\nassurance that SOFR will perform in the same\nway as LIBOR would have at any time,\nincluding, without limitation, as a result of\nchanges in interest and yield rates\nin the market, market volatility or global or\nregional economic, financial, political,\nregulatory, judicial or other events. For\nexample, since publication of SOFR began on\nApril 3, 2018, daily changes in SOFR have, on\noccasion, been more\nvolatile than daily changes in comparable\nbenchmark or other market rates. Uncertainty\nsurrounding the establishment of market\nconventions related to the calculation of\nCompounded SOFR and whether it is a suitable\nsubstitute or successor for LIBOR\nmay adversely affect the value of and the\nreturn on Compounded SOFR notes.\n\nThe SOFR Administrator May Make Changes That\nCould Change The Value of SOFR Or Discontinue\nSOFR And Has No Obligation To Consider Your\nInterests In Doing So.\n\nSOFR, which will be used to\ncalculate Compounded SOFR, is a relatively new\nrate, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\n(or a successor), as administrator of SOFR,\nmay make methodological or other changes that\ncould change the value of SOFR, including\nchanges related to the\nmethod by which SOFR is calculated,\neligibility criteria applicable to the\ntransactions used to calculate SOFR, or timing\nrelated to the publication of SOFR. In\naddition, the administrator may alter,\ndiscontinue or suspend calculation or\ndissemination of SOFR (in which case an\nalternative rate referenced in the definition\nof \u0093Benchmark Replacement\u0094 under the section\nentitled \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities\u0097Floating Rate Debt Securities\u0097Base\nRates\u0097Compounded SOFR Notes\u0094 will apply). The\nadministrator has no obligation to consider\nyour interests in calculating, adjusting,\nconverting, revising or discontinuing SOFR.\nFor each interest period for which any debt\nsecurities bear\ninterest at a floating rate based on\nCompounded SOFR, SOFR (as referenced in the\nformula to determine Compounded SOFR) in\nrespect of a particular date will not be\nadjusted for any modifications, corrections or\namendments to SOFR data that the\nadministrator of SOFR may publish after SOFR\nfor such day has been determined as described\nherein.\n\nIf A Benchmark Transition Event And Its\nRelated Benchmark Replacement Date Occur With\nRespect To Compounded SOFR (Including Daily\nSOFR), The Interest Rate For Any Applicable\nInterest Period Will No Longer Be Determined\nBy Reference To Compounded SOFR.\n\nIf a Benchmark Transition Event and its\nrelated Benchmark Replacement Date occur with\nrespect to Compounded SOFR (including daily\nSOFR), then\nthe interest rate on Compounded SOFR notes for\nany applicable interest period will no longer\nbe determined by reference to Compounded SOFR,\nbut instead will be determined by us or our\ndesignee by reference to another rate, as\ndescribed herein under\nthe section entitled \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities\u0097Floating Rate Debt Securities\u0097Base\nRates\u0097Compounded SOFR Notes.\u0094 The composition\nand characteristics of any Benchmark\nReplacement may not be the same as Compounded\nSOFR\n(including daily SOFR) and there can be no\nguarantee that any Benchmark Replacement will\nbe a comparable substitute for Compounded SOFR\n(including daily SOFR). The occurrence of a\nBenchmark Transition Event and\n\n8\n\nits related Benchmark Replacement Date and the\nimplementation of a Benchmark Replacement may\nadversely affect the value of and the return\non Compounded SOFR notes.\n\nThe Benchmark Replacement Is Uncertain.\n\nCompounded SOFR notes provide that the\nfloating rate of interest on the debt\nsecurities for each applicable interest period\nwill be\ndetermined by reference to Compounded SOFR or\nanother rate pursuant to the definition of\n\u0093Benchmark Replacement\u0094 set forth herein under\nthe section entitled \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities\u0097Floating Rate Debt Securities\u0097Base\nRates\u0097Compounded SOFR Notes.\u0094 If each\nalternative rate referenced in the definition\nof \u0093Benchmark Replacement\u0094 is unavailable or\nindeterminable, we or our designee will\ndetermine the Benchmark Replacement that will\napply to\nCompounded SOFR notes. The substitution of a\nBenchmark Replacement for Compounded SOFR may\nadversely affect the value of and the return\non Compounded SOFR notes.\n\nWe Or Our Designee Will Have Authority To Make\nDeterminations, Elections, Calculations And\nAdjustments That Could Affect The Value Of And\nThe Return On Compounded SOFR Notes.\n\nWe or our designee will make determinations,\ndecisions, elections, calculations and\nadjustments\nas set forth under the section entitled\n\u0093Description of Debt Securities\u0097Floating Rate\nDebt Securities\u0097Base Rates\u0097Compounded SOFR\nNotes\u0094 herein that may adversely affect the\nvalue of and the return on Compounded SOFR\nnotes.\nIn particular, we or our designee will\ndetermine the Benchmark Replacement and the\nBenchmark Replacement Adjustment and can apply\nany Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes\ndeemed reasonably necessary to adopt the\nBenchmark Replacement. Although\nwe or our designee will exercise judgment in\ngood faith when performing such functions,\npotential conflicts of interest may exist\nbetween us, our designee and you. All\ndeterminations, decisions, elections,\ncalculations and adjustments by us or our\ndesignee in our or its sole discretion will be\nconclusive for all purposes and binding on us\nand holders of Compounded SOFR notes absent\nmanifest error. In making the determinations,\ndecisions, elections, calculations and\nadjustments noted under the\nsection entitled \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities\u0097Floating Rate Debt Securities\u0097Base\nRates\u0097Compounded SOFR Notes\u0094 herein, we or our\ndesignee may have economic interests that are\nadverse to your interests, and such\ndeterminations, decisions, elections,\ncalculations and adjustments may adversely\naffect the value of and the return on\nCompounded SOFR notes. Because the Benchmark\nReplacement is uncertain, we or our designee\nare likely to exercise more discretion\nin respect of calculating interest payable on\nCompounded SOFR notes than would be the case\nin the absence of a Benchmark Transition Event\nand its related Benchmark Replacement Date.\n\nResearch Reports By Us Or Our Affiliates May\nBe Inconsistent With An Investment In\nCompounded SOFR Notes.\n\nWe or our affiliates may, at present or in the\nfuture, publish research reports on Compounded\nSOFR, SOFR and any Benchmark Replacement. This\nresearch is modified from time to time without\nnotice and may, at present or in the future,\nexpress opinions or provide recommendations\nthat are inconsistent with purchasing or\nholding Compounded SOFR notes. Any such\nresearch reports could adversely\naffect the value of and the return on\nCompounded SOFR notes.\n\nThe Secondary Trading Market For Debt\nSecurities Linked To Compounded SOFR May Be\nLimited.\n\nSince Compounded SOFR is a relatively new\nbenchmark rate, Compounded SOFR notes may have\nno established trading\nmarket when issued and an established trading\nmarket may never develop or may not be very\nliquid. Market terms for debt securities\nlinked to Compounded SOFR (such as Compounded\nSOFR notes) such as the spread may evolve over\ntime and, as a result,\ntrading prices of Compounded SOFR notes may be\nlower than those of later-issued debt\nsecurities that are linked to Compounded SOFR.\nSimilarly, if Compounded SOFR does not prove\nto be widely used in debt securities similar\nto the Compounded SOFR\nnotes, the trading\n\n9\n\nprice of Compounded SOFR notes may be lower\nthan that of comparable debt securities linked\nto rates that are more widely used. Investors\nin Compounded SOFR notes may not be able to\nsell such\nnotes at all or may not be able to sell such\nnotes at prices that will provide them with a\nyield comparable to similar investments that\nhave a developed secondary market. Further,\ninvestors wishing to sell Compounded SOFR\nnotes in the secondary\nmarket will have to make assumptions as to the\nfuture performance of Compounded SOFR during\nthe interest period in which they intend the\nsale to take place. As a result, investors may\nsuffer from increased pricing volatility and\nmarket risk.\n\nRisks Relating to Securities Denominated In A\nForeign Currency\n\nYou should consult your financial and legal\nadvisors as to any specific risks entailed by\nan investment in securities that are\ndenominated or\npayable in a currency other than the currency\nof the country in which you are resident or in\nwhich you conduct your business, which we\nrefer to as your \u0093.\u0094 These securities are not\nappropriate investments for investors\nwho are not sophisticated in foreign currency\ntransactions. We disclaim any responsibility\nto advise prospective purchasers who are\nresidents of countries other than the United\nStates of any matters arising under\nnon-U.S. law that may affect the purchase of\nor holding of, or the receipt of payments on,\nthese securities. These persons should consult\ntheir own legal and financial advisors\nconcerning these matters.\n\nExchange Rates And Exchange Controls May\nAffect Securities\u0092 Value Or Return\n\nGeneral Exchange Rate And Exchange Control\nRisks. An investment in a security that is\ndenominated or payable in currencies other\nthan\nyour home currency entails significant risks.\nThese risks include the possibility of\nsignificant changes in rates of exchange\nbetween your home currency and the relevant\nforeign currencies and the possibility of the\nimposition or modification of\nexchange controls by the relevant governmental\nentities. These risks generally depend on\neconomic and political events over which we\nhave no control.\n\nExchange Rates Will Affect Your Investment. In\nrecent years, rates of exchange between some\ncurrencies have been highly volatile and\nthis volatility may continue in the future.\nFluctuations in any particular exchange rate\nthat have occurred in the past are not\nnecessarily indicative, however, of\nfluctuations that may occur during the term of\nany security. Depreciation of the\ncurrency in which a security is payable\nagainst your home currency would result in a\ndecrease in the effective yield of the\nsecurity below its coupon rate or in the\npayout of the security and could result in an\noverall loss to you on a home currency\nbasis.\n\nThere May Be Specific Exchange Rate Risks\nApplicable To Warrants And Purchase Contracts.\nFluctuations in the rates of\nexchange between your home currency and other\ncurrency (i) in which the exercise price of a\nwarrant or the purchase price of a purchase\ncontract is payable, (ii) in which the value\nof the property underlying a warrant or\npurchase contract\nis quoted or (iii) to be purchased or sold by\nexercise of a warrant or pursuant to a\npurchase contract or in the rates of exchange\namong any of these currencies may change the\nvalue of a warrant, a purchase contract or a\nunit that includes a\nwarrant or purchase contract. You could lose\nmoney on your investment as a result of these\nfluctuations, even if the spot price of the\nproperty underlying the warrant or purchase\ncontract were such that the warrant or\npurchase contract appeared to\nbe \u0093in the money.\u0094\n\nWe Have No Control Over Exchange Rates.\nCurrency exchange rates can either float or be\nfixed by\nsovereign governments. Exchange rates of most\neconomically developed nations are permitted\nto fluctuate in value relative to each other.\nHowever, from time to time governments may use\na variety of techniques, such as intervention\nby a country\u0092s\ncentral bank, the imposition of regulatory\ncontrols or taxes or changes in interest rates\nto influence the exchange rates of their\ncurrencies. Governments may also issue a new\ncurrency to replace an existing currency or\nalter the exchange rate or\nrelative exchange characteristics by a\ndevaluation or revaluation of a currency.\nThese governmental actions could change or\ninterfere with currency valuations and\ncurrency fluctuations that would otherwise\noccur in response to economic forces, as\nwell as in response to the movement of\ncurrencies across borders.\n\n10\n\nAs a consequence, these government actions\ncould adversely affect yields or payouts in\nyour\nhome currency for (i) securities denominated\nor payable in currencies other than your home\ncurrency, (ii) warrants or purchase contracts\nwhere the exercise price or the purchase price\nis denominated in a currency differing from\nyour home\ncurrency or where the value of the property\nunderlying the warrants or purchase contracts\nis quoted in a currency other than your home\ncurrency and (iii) warrants or purchase\ncontracts to purchase or sell foreign\ncurrency.\n\nWe will not make any adjustment or change in\nthe terms of the securities in the event that\nexchange rates should become fixed, or in the\nevent of any devaluation or revaluation or\nimposition of exchange or other regulatory\ncontrols or taxes, or in the event of other\ndevelopments affecting your home currency or\nany specified foreign currency. You will bear\nthose risks.\n\nSome Foreign Currencies May Become\nUnavailable.Governments have imposed from time\nto time, and may in the future impose,\nexchange\ncontrols that could also affect the\navailability of a specified currency. Even if\nthere are no actual exchange controls, it is\npossible that the specified currency for any\nsecurity would not be available when payments\non that security are due.\n\nAlternative Payment Currency Used If Payment\nCurrency Becomes Unavailable.Unless otherwise\nspecified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, if a payment currency is\nunavailable, we will make required payments in\nU.S. dollars on the basis of the market\nexchange rate. However, if the specified\ncurrency for any security is not available\nbecause the euro has been substituted for\nthat currency, we will make the payments in\neuros. The mechanisms for making payments in\nthese alternative currencies are explained in\n\u0093Description of Debt Securities\u0097Interest and\nPrincipal Payments\u0094 below.\n\nCurrency Conversions May Affect Payments On\nSome Securities\n\nThe applicable prospectus supplement may\nprovide for (i) payments on a non-U.S. dollar\ndenominated security to be made in U.S.\ndollars or (ii) payments on a U.S. dollar\ndenominated security to be made in a currency\nother than U.S. dollars. In these cases, the\nexchange agent identified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement will\nconvert the currencies. You will bear the\ncosts of conversion through deductions from\nthose payments.\n\nExchange Rates May Affect the Value Of A New\nYork Judgment Involving Non-U.S.Dollar\nDenominated Securities\n\nIf the\nsecurities are governed by and construed in\naccordance with the laws of the State of New\nYork and a New York court were to enter a\njudgment in an action on any securities\ndenominated in a foreign currency, such court\nwould either enter a judgment in\nU.S. dollars based on the prevailing rate of\nexchange between the foreign currency and the\nU.S. dollar on the date such judgment is\nentered or enter judgment in the foreign\ncurrency and convert the judgment or decree\ninto U.S. dollars at the\nprevailing rate of exchange on the date such\njudgment or decree is entered.\n\n11\n\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION We file\nannual, quarterly and special reports, proxy\nstatements and other information with the SEC.\nOur SEC filings are available to the public\nover the internet at the SEC\u0092s website at\nhttp://www.sec.gov.

A\nsignificant source of funds to pay dividends\non our\ncommon and preferred stock and debt service on\nour debt is dividends from our subsidiaries.\nVarious federal and state statutes and\nregulations limit the amount of dividends that\nour banking and other subsidiaries may pay to\nus without regulatory\napproval.\n\n14\n\nUSE OF PROCEEDS Unless the applicable\nprospectus supplement states otherwise, the\nnet proceeds from the sale of the offered\nsecurities will be added to our general funds\nand will be available for general corporate\npurposes, including, but not limited to, the\nfollowing:\n                                              \n  \u25cf    investments in or advances to our      \n       existing or future subsidiaries;       \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25cf    repayment of obligations that have     \n       matured;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n       the repurchase or redemption of our    \n       outstanding securities, including,     \n  \u25cf    but not limited to, debt securities    \n       and                                    \n       preferred stock and related            \n       depositary shares, as applicable; and  \n                                              \n                                       \n  \u25cf    reducing our outstanding debt.  \n                                       \nUntil the net proceeds have been used, they\nwill be invested in short-term securities. 15\n\nDESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES\n\nThis section describes the general terms and\nprovisions of our debt securities, which could\nbe senior debt securities or subordinated debt\nsecurities. The prospectus supplement will\ndescribe the specific terms of the debt\nsecurities offered through that prospectus\nsupplement and any general terms outlined in\nthis section that will not apply to those debt\nsecurities.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, the senior debt\nsecurities will be issued under an indenture\ndated as of\nFebruary 21, 2017 between us and Citibank,\nN.A., as senior trustee, referred to herein as\nthe \u0093,\u0094 and the subordinated debt securities\nwill be issued under an indenture dated as of\nFebruary 23, 2017 between\nus and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust\nCompany, National Association, as subordinated\ntrustee, referred to herein as the \u0093.\u0094\n\nWe have summarized the material terms and\nprovisions of the senior and subordinated\nindentures in this section. We have also filed\neach of\nthese indentures as exhibits to the\nregistration statement of which this\nprospectus is a part. You should read the\napplicable indenture for additional\ninformation before you buy any debt\nsecurities. The summary that follows includes\nreferences to\nsection numbers of these indentures so that\nyou can more easily locate these provisions.\n\nA prospectus supplement to this prospectus may\nrelate to a series of medium-term notes,\nestablished as a series of debt securities\nunder an indenture. In that event, references\nherein to terms and conditions of debt\nsecurities being provided in the \u0093applicable\nprospectus supplement\u0094\nmay be provided in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement and/or applicable pricing\nsupplement for such debt securities.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe debt securities will be our direct\nunsecured obligations. Neither of the\nindentures limits the amount of debt\nsecurities that we may\nissue. Both indentures permit us to issue debt\nsecurities from time to time and debt\nsecurities issued under an indenture will be\nissued as part of a series that has been\nestablished by us under such indenture.\n(Section 301)\n\nThe senior debt securities will be unsecured\nand will rank equally with all of our other\nunsecured unsubordinated debt. The\nsubordinated debt\nsecurities will be unsecured and will rank\nequally with all of our other subordinated\ndebt securities and, together with such other\nsubordinated debt securities, will be\nsubordinated to all of our existing and future\nSenior Debt. See\n\u0093\u0097Subordination\u0094 below. Holders of our debt\nsecurities may be fully subordinated to\ninterests held by the U.S. government in the\nevent that we enter into a receivership,\ninsolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding.\n\nThe debt securities are our unsecured senior\nor subordinated debt securities, as the case\nmay be, but our assets consist primarily of\nequity\nin our subsidiaries. We are a separate and\ndistinct legal entity from our subsidiaries.\nAs a result, our ability to make payments on\nour debt securities depends on our receipt of\ndividends, loan payments and other funds from\nour subsidiaries.\nVarious federal and state statutes and\nregulations limit the amount of dividends that\nour banking and other subsidiaries may pay us\nwithout regulatory approval. In addition, if\nany of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent, the\ndirect creditors of that\nsubsidiary will have a prior claim on its\nassets. Our rights and the rights of our\ncreditors, including your rights as an owner\nof our debt securities, will be subject to\nthat prior claim, unless we are also a direct\ncreditor of that subsidiary.\nThis subordination of creditors of a parent\ncompany to prior claims of creditors of its\nsubsidiaries is commonly referred to as\nstructural subordination.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, we may, without the\nconsent of the holders of a series of debt\nsecurities, issue additional debt securities\nof that series having the same ranking and the\nsame interest rate, maturity date and other\nterms (other than the original issue date, the\ndate, if any, that\n\n16\n\ninterest begins to accrue and the issue price,\nwhich may vary) as such debt securities. Any\nsuch additional debt securities, together with\nthe initial debt securities, will constitute a\nsingle series of debt securities under the\napplicable indenture. No additional debt\nsecurities of a series may be issued if an\nevent of default under the applicable\nindenture has occurred and is continuing with\nrespect to that series of debt securities. A\nprospectus supplement relating to a series of\ndebt securities being offered will include\nspecific terms relating to the offering.\n(Section 301) These terms will include some or\nall of the following:\n                                              \n  \u25cf    the title and type of the debt         \n       securities;

      \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25cf    the date from which interest will      \n       accrue;                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25cf    the record and interest payment dates  \n       for the debt securities;

(Section 101) A \u0093 global\nsecurity\u0094 is a debt security that we issue in\naccordance with the applicable indenture to\nrepresent all or part of a series of debt\nsecurities. Exchange and Transfer Any debt\nsecurities of a series can be exchanged for\nother debt securities of that series so long\nas the other debt securities are denominated\nin authorized denominations and have the same\naggregate principal 18\n\namount and same terms as the debt securities\nthat were surrendered for exchange. The debt\nsecurities may be presented for registration\nof transfer, duly endorsed or accompanied by a\nsatisfactory written instrument of transfer,\nat the office or agency maintained by us for\nthat purpose in Minneapolis, Minnesota (or any\nother place of payment). However, holders of\nglobal securities may transfer and exchange\nglobal securities only in the manner and to\nthe extent set forth under \u0093\u0097Book-Entry,\nDelivery and Form\u0094 below. There will be no\nservice charge for any registration of\ntransfer or exchange of the debt securities,\nbut we may require holders to pay any tax or\nother governmental charge payable in\nconnection with a transfer or exchange of the\ndebt securities. (Sections 305, 1002) If the\napplicable prospectus supplement refers to any\noffice or agency, in addition to the security\nregistrar initially designated by us, where\nholders can surrender the debt securities for\nregistration of transfer or exchange, we may\nat any time rescind the designation of any\nsuch office or agency or approve a change in\nthe location. However, we will be required to\nmaintain an office or agency in each place of\npayment for that series. (Section 1002) We\nwill not be required to:\n                                              \n       register the transfer of or exchange   \n       debt securities to be redeemed for a   \n  \u25cf    period of 15\u00a0calendar days             \n       preceding the mailing of the relevant  \n       notice of redemption; or               \n                                              \n                                              \n       register the transfer of or exchange   \n       any registered debt security selected  \n       for redemption, in whole or in part,   \n  \u25cf    except the unredeemed or unpaid        \n       portion of that registered debt        \n       security being redeemed in part.       \n       (Section 305)                          \n                                              \nInterest and Principal Payments\nPayments.Holders may present debt securities\nfor payment of principal, premium, if any, and\ninterest, if any, register the transfer of the\ndebt securities and exchange the debt\nsecurities at the agency in Minneapolis,\nMinnesota (or any other place of payment)\nmaintained by us for that purpose. On the date\nof this prospectus, the paying agent for the\ndebt securities issued under the indentures is\nComputershare, as agent and attorney-in-\nfactfor Wells Fargo Bank, acting through its\noffice at 600 S. 4 thStreet, 7 thFloor, MAC\nN9300-070,Minneapolis, MN 55415, Attn: CTS-\nWellsFargo Administrator (or at such other\nplace or places as may be designated from time\nto time). We refer to Computershare, as agent\nand attorney-in-factfor Wells Fargo Bank, or\nany successor identified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, acting in this capacity\nfor the debt securities, as the \u0093 paying\nagent.\u0094 Wells Fargo Bank is one of our\naffiliates. Any money that we pay to the\npaying agent for the purpose of making\npayments on the debt securities and that\nremains unclaimed two years after the payments\nwere due will, at our request, be returned to\nus and after that time any holder of a debt\nsecurity can only look to us for the payments\non the debt security. (Section 1003) Although\nwe anticipate making payments of principal,\npremium, if any, and interest, if any, on most\ndebt securities in U.S. dollars, some debt\nsecurities may be payable in foreign\ncurrencies as specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. Currently, few\nfacilities exist in the United States to\nconvert U.S. dollars into foreign currencies\nand vice versa. In addition, most U.S. banks\ndo not offer non-U.S.dollar denominated\nchecking or savings account facilities.\nAccordingly, unless alternative arrangements\nare made, we will pay principal, premium, if\nany, and interest, if any, on debt securities\nthat are payable in a foreign currency to an\naccount at a bank outside the United States,\nwhich, in the case of a debt security payable\nin euros, will be made by credit or transfer\nto a euro account specified by the payee in a\ncountry for which the euro is the lawful\ncurrency. Recipients of Payments.The paying\nagent will pay interest, if any, to the person\nin whose name the debt security is registered\nat the close of business on the applicable\nrecord date. Unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, the \u0093 record\ndate\u0094 for any interest payment date is the\ndate 15 calendar days 19\n\nprior to that interest payment date, whether\nor not that day is a business day. However,\nupon maturity, redemption or repayment, the\npaying agent will pay any interest due to the\nperson to whom it pays the principal of the\ndebt security. The paying agent will make the\npayment on the date of maturity, redemption or\nrepayment, whether or not that date is an\ninterest payment date. Unless otherwise\nspecified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, the paying agent will make the\ninitial interest payment on a debt security on\nthe first interest payment date falling after\nthe date of issuance, unless the date of\nissuance is less than 15 calendar days before\nan interest payment date. In that case, the\npaying agent will pay interest or, in the case\nof an amortizing debt security, principal and\ninterest, on the next succeeding interest\npayment date to the holder of record on the\nrecord date corresponding to the succeeding\ninterest payment date. An \u0093 interest payment\ndate\u0094 for any debt security means a date on\nwhich, under the terms of that debt security,\nregularly scheduled interest is payable. Book-\nEntry Debt Securities.The paying agent will\nmake payments of principal, premium, if any,\nand interest, if any, to the account of The\nDepository Trust Company, referred to herein\nas \u0093 DTC,\u0094 or other depositary specified in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement, as\nholder of book-entry debt securities, by wire\ntransfer of immediately available funds. We\nexpect that the depositary, upon receipt of\nany payment, will immediately credit its\nparticipants\u0092 accounts in amounts\nproportionate to their respective beneficial\ninterests in the book-entry debt securities as\nshown on the records of the depositary. We\nalso expect that payments by the depositary\u0092s\nparticipants to owners of beneficial interests\nin the book-entry debt securities will be\ngoverned by standing customer instructions and\ncustomary practices and will be the\nresponsibility of those participants.\nCertificated Debt Securities.Except as\nindicated below for payments of interest at\nmaturity, redemption or repayment, the paying\nagent will make U.S. dollar payments of\ninterest either:\n                                              \n       by check mailed to the address of the  \n  \u25cf    person entitled to payment as shown    \n       on the security register; or           \n                                              \n                                              \n       by wire transfer to an account         \n       designated by a holder, if the holder  \n  \u25cf    has given written notice not later     \n       than 10                                \n       calendar days prior to the applicable  \n       interest payment date. (Section 307)   \n                                              \nU.S. dollar payments of principal, premium, if\nany, and interest, if any, upon maturity,\nredemption or repayment on a debt security\nwill be made in immediately available funds\nagainst presentation and surrender of the debt\nsecurity at the office of the paying agent.\nUnavailability of Foreign Currency. The\nrelevant specified currency may not be\navailable to us for making payments of\nprincipal of, premium, if any, or interest, if\nany, on any debt security. This could occur\ndue to the imposition of exchange controls or\nother circumstances beyond our control or if\nthe specified currency is no longer used by\nthe government of the country issuing that\ncurrency or by public institutions within the\ninternational banking community for the\nsettlement of transactions. If the specified\ncurrency is unavailable, we may satisfy our\nobligations to holders of the debt securities\nby making those payments on the date of\npayment in U.S. dollars on the basis of the\nnoon dollar buying rate in New York, New York\nfor cable transfers of the currency or\ncurrencies in which a payment on any debt\nsecurity was to be made, published by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York (the \u0093\nFRBNY\u0094), which we refer to as the \u0093 market\nexchange rate.\u0094 If that rate of exchange is\nnot then available or is not published for a\nparticular payment currency, the market\nexchange rate will be based on the highest bid\nquotation in New York, New York received by\nthe exchange rate agent at approximately 11:00\na.m., New York City time, on the second\nbusiness day preceding the applicable payment\ndate from three recognized foreign exchange\ndealers for the purchase by the quoting\ndealer:\n                                              \n       of the specified currency for U.S.     \n  \u25cf    dollars for settlement on the payment  \n       date;                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       in the aggregate amount of the         \n  \u25cf    specified currency payable to those    \n       holders or beneficial owners of debt   \n       securities; and                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25cf    at which the applicable dealer         \n       commits to execute a contract.         \n                                              \n20\n\nOne of the dealers providing quotations may be\nthe exchange rate agent appointed by us unless\nthe exchange rate agent is our affiliate. If\nthose bid quotations are not available, the\nexchange rate agent will determine the market\nexchange rate at its sole discretion. These\nprovisions do not apply if a specified\ncurrency is unavailable because it has been\nreplaced by the euro. Unless otherwise\nspecified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, if the euro has been substituted\nfor a specified currency, the debt securities\nwill be redenominated in euros on a date\ndetermined by us, with a principal amount for\neach debt security equal to the principal\namount of that debt security in the specified\ncurrency, converted into euros at the\nestablished rate (as defined below); provided\nthat, if we determine after consultation with\nthe paying agent that the then-current market\npractice in respect of redenomination into\neuros of internationally offered securities is\ndifferent from the provisions specified above,\nsuch provisions will be deemed to be amended\nso as to comply with such market practice and\nwe will promptly notify the applicable trustee\nand the paying agent of such deemed amendment.\nThe \u0093 established rate\u0094 means the rate for the\nconversion of the specified currency\n(including compliance with rules relating to\nrounding in accordance with applicable\nEuropean Union regulations) into euros\nestablished by the Council of European Union\npursuant to the Treaty establishing the\nEuropean Communities, as amended by the Treaty\non European Union. We will give 30 days\u0092\nnotice of the redenomination date to the\npaying agent and the applicable trustee. Any\npayment made in U.S. dollars or in euros as\ndescribed above where the required payment is\nin an unavailable specified currency will not\nconstitute an event of default under the\napplicable indenture. Discount Debt\nSecurities.Some debt securities may be\nconsidered to be issued with original issue\ndiscount, which in most cases must be included\nin income for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nat a constant yield regardless of the\naccounting method of the holder. We refer to\nthese debt securities in this prospectus as \u0093\ndiscount notes.\u0094 See the discussion under\n\u0093United States Federal Income Tax\nConsiderations\u0094 below. In the event of a\nredemption or repayment of any discount note\nor if the principal of any debt security that\nis considered to be issued with original issue\ndiscount is declared to be due and payable\nimmediately as described under \u0093\u0097Events of\nDefault and Covenant Breaches\u0094 below, the\namount of principal due and payable on that\ndebt security will be limited to:\n                                              \n       the aggregate principal amount of the  \n  \u25cf    debt security multiplied by the sum    \n       of                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       its issue price, expressed as a        \n  \u25cf    percentage of the aggregate principal  \n       amount, plus                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       the original issue discount amortized  \n       from the date of issue to the date of  \n  \u25cf    declaration, expressed as a            \n       percentage of the aggregate principal  \n       amount.                                \n                                              \nFor purposes of determining the amount of\noriginal issue discount that has accrued as of\nany date on which a redemption, repayment or\nacceleration of maturity occurs for a discount\nnote, original issue discount will be accrued\nusing a constant yield method. The constant\nyield will be calculated using a 30-daymonth,\n360-dayyear convention, a compounding period\nthat, except for the initial period (as\ndefined below), corresponds to the shortest\nperiod between interest payment dates for the\napplicable discount note (with ratable\naccruals within a compounding period), and an\nassumption that the maturity of a discount\nnote will not be accelerated. If the period\nfrom the date of issue to the first interest\npayment date for a discount note (the \u0093\ninitial period\u0094) is shorter than the\ncompounding period for the discount note, a\nproportionate amount of the yield for an\nentire compounding period will be accrued. If\nthe initial period is longer than the\ncompounding period, then the period will be\ndivided into a regular compounding period and\na short period with the short period being\ntreated as provided in the preceding sentence.\nThe accrual of the applicable original issue\ndiscount discussed above may differ from the\naccrual of original issue discount for\npurposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,\nas amended (the \u0093 Code\u0094), certain discount\nnotes may not be treated as having original\nissue discount within the meaning of the Code,\nand debt securities other than discount notes\nmay be treated as issued with original issue\ndiscount for federal income tax purposes. See\nthe discussion under \u0093United States Federal\nIncome Tax Considerations\u0094 below. In addition,\nsee the applicable prospectus supplement for\nany additional considerations applicable to\nthese debt securities. 21\n\nCertain Definitions.

References in\nthis prospectus to \u0093\u0094 and \u0093\u0094 are to the single\ncurrency introduced at the commencement of the\nthird stage of the European Economic and\nMonetary Union pursuant to\nthe Treaty establishing the European\nCommunity, as amended. References in this\nprospectus to \u0093,\u0094 \u0093\u0094 or \u0093\u0094 are to the currency\nof the United Kingdom.\n\nFixed Rate Debt Securities\n\nWe may\nissue debt securities that bear interest at a\nfixed rate (\u0093\u0094). Each fixed rate debt security\nwill bear interest from, and including, the\ndate of issuance at the annual rate specified\nin the applicable\nprospectus supplement until the principal is\npaid or made available for payment. Unless\notherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, the following\nprovisions will apply to fixed rate debt\nsecurities offered pursuant to this\nprospectus.\n\nHow Interest Is Calculated. Interest on fixed\nrate debt securities will be computed on the\nbasis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day\nmonths.\n\nHow Interest Accrues. Interest on fixed rate\ndebt securities will accrue from, and\nincluding, the most recent interest payment\ndate to which interest has been paid or duly\nprovided for or, if no interest has been paid\nor duly provided for, from, and\nincluding, the issue date or any other date\nspecified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement on which interest begins to accrue.\nInterest will accrue to, but excluding, the\nnext interest payment date or, if earlier, the\ndate on which the principal\nhas been paid or duly made available for\npayment, except as described below under \u0093\u0097If\nA Payment Date Is Not A Business Day.\u0094\n\nWhen Interest Is Paid. Payments of interest on\nfixed rate debt securities will be made on the\ninterest payment dates specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. However,\nunless otherwise specified in the\n\n22\n\napplicable prospectus supplement, if the first\ninterest payment date is less than 15 calendar\ndays after the issue date, interest will not\nbe paid on the first interest payment date,\nbut will be paid on the second interest\npayment date. Amount Of Interest\nPayable.Interest payments for fixed rate debt\nsecurities will include accrued interest from,\nand including, the issue date or from, and\nincluding, the last interest payment date in\nrespect of which interest has been paid or\nprovided for, as the case may be, to, but\nexcluding, the relevant interest payment date\nor date of maturity or earlier redemption or\nrepayment, as the case may be. If A Payment\nDate Is Not A Business Day.If any scheduled\ninterest payment date is not a business day,\nwe will pay interest on the next business day,\nbut interest on that payment will not accrue\nduring the period from and after the scheduled\ninterest payment date. If the scheduled\nmaturity date or date of redemption or\nrepayment is not a business day, we may pay\ninterest, if any, and principal and premium,\nif any, on the next business day, but interest\non that payment will not accrue during the\nperiod from and after the scheduled maturity\ndate or date of redemption or repayment.\nAmortizing Debt Securities.A fixed rate debt\nsecurity may pay a level amount in respect of\nboth interest and principal amortized over the\nlife of the debt security. Payments of\nprincipal and interest on amortizing debt\nsecurities will be made on the interest\npayment dates specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, and at maturity or upon\nany earlier redemption or repayment. Payments\non amortizing debt securities will be applied\nfirst to interest due and payable and then to\nthe reduction of the unpaid principal amount.\nWe will provide to the original purchaser, and\nwill furnish to subsequent holders upon\nrequest to us, a table setting forth repayment\ninformation for each amortizing debt security.\nFloating Rate Debt Securities We may issue\ndebt securities that bear interest at a\nfloating rate as discussed herein (\u0093 floating\nrate debt securities\u0094). Unless otherwise\nspecified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, the following provisions will\napply to floating rate debt securities offered\npursuant to this prospectus. Each floating\nrate debt security will mature on the date\nspecified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. Each floating rate debt security\nwill bear interest at a floating rate\ndetermined by reference to an interest rate or\ninterest rate formula, which we refer to as\nthe \u0093 base rate.\u0094 The base rate may be one or\nmore of the following:\n                                              \n       Compounded SOFR (floating rate debt    \n       securities with a base rate of         \n  \u25cf    Compounded SOFR are referred to        \n       herein as                              \n       \u0093Compounded SOFR notes\u0094);                \n                                              \n                 \n  \u25cf    EURIBOR;  \n                 \n                                            \n  \u25cf    the federal funds (effective) rate;  \n                                            \n                        \n  \u25cf    the prime rate;  \n                        \n                           \n  \u25cf    the Treasury rate;  \n                           \n                         \n  \u25cf    the CMT rate; or  \n                         \n                                              \n       any other rate or interest rate        \n  \u25cf    formula specified in the applicable    \n       prospectus supplement.                 \n                                              \n23\n\nFormula For Interest Rates. The interest rate\non each floating rate debt security will be\ncalculated by reference to:\n                                              \n  \u25cf    the specified base rate based on the   \n       index maturity, if applicable;         \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25cf    plus or minus the spread, if any;      \n       and/or                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25cf    multiplied by the spread multiplier,   \n       if any.                                \n                                              \nFor any floating rate debt security, if\napplicable, \u0093 index maturity\u0094 means the period\nof maturity of the instrument or obligation\nfrom which the base rate is calculated and\nwill be specified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. The \u0093 spread\u0094 is the number of\nbasis points (one one-hundredthof a percentage\npoint) specified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement to be added to or subtracted from\nthe base rate for a floating rate debt\nsecurity. The \u0093 spread multiplier\u0094 is the\npercentage that may be specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement to be applied\nto the base rate for a floating rate debt\nsecurity. The interest rate on any inverse\nfloating rate debt security will also be\ncalculated by reference to a fixed rate.\nLimitations On Interest Rate.A floating rate\ndebt security may also have either or both of\nthe following limitations on the interest\nrate:\n                                              \n       a maximum limitation, or ceiling, on   \n       the rate of interest which may accrue  \n  \u25cf    during any interest period, which we   \n       refer to as the \u0093maximum interest       \n       rate\u0094; and/or                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       a minimum limitation, or floor, on     \n       the rate of interest that may accrue   \n  \u25cf    during any interest period, which we   \n       refer to as the \u0093minimum interest       \n       rate.\u0094                                  \n                                              \nAny applicable maximum interest rate or\nminimum interest rate will be set forth in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. New York\nState law governs the indentures under which\nthe debt securities will be issued. New York\nhas usury laws that limit the amount of\ninterest that can be charged and paid on\nloans, which includes floating rate debt\nsecurities. Under present New York usury law,\nthe maximum permissible rate of interest,\nsubject to some exceptions, is 16% per annum\non a simple interest basis for debt securities\nin which less than $250,000 has been invested\nand 25% per annum on a simple interest basis\nfor debt securities in which $250,000 or more\nhas been invested. This limit may not apply to\nfloating rate debt securities in which\n$2,500,000 or more has been invested. How\nCertain Floating Interest Rates Are Reset. The\nterms and provisions set forth in this section\n\u0093\u0097How Certain Floating Interest Rates Are\nReset\u0094 will only apply to any floating rate\ndebt securities for which the specified base\nrate is EURIBOR, the federal funds (effective)\nrate, the prime rate, the Treasury rate, the\nCMT rate or any other base rate specified in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement that\nspecifically references this section \u0093\u0097How\nCertain Floating Interest Rates Are Reset\u0094\n(each, an \u0093 in advance base rate\u0094). For\navoidance of doubt, this section \u0093\u0097How Certain\nFloating Interest Rates Are Reset\u0094 shall not\napply to Compounded SOFR notes. The interest\nrate in effect from the issue date to the\nfirst interest reset date for a floating rate\ndebt security governed by this section \u0093\u0097How\nCertain Floating Interest Rates Are Reset\u0094\nwill be the initial interest rate specified in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement. We refer\nto this rate as the \u0093 initial interest rate.\u0094\nThe interest rate on each floating rate debt\nsecurity governed by this section \u0093\u0097How\nCertain Floating Interest Rates Are Reset\u0094 may\nbe reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly,\nsemiannually or annually. This period is the \u0093\ninterest reset period\u0094 and the first day of\neach interest reset period is the \u0093 interest\nreset date.\u0094 The \u0093 interest determination\ndate\u0094 for any interest reset date is the day\nthe calculation agent will refer to when\ndetermining the new interest 24\n\nrate at which a floating rate governed by this\nsection \u0093\u0097How Certain Floating Interest Rates\nAre Reset\u0094 will reset, and, unless otherwise\nspecified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, is applicable as follows:\n                                              \n       for federal funds (effective) rate     \n       debt securities and prime rate debt    \n  \u25cf    securities, the interest               \n       determination                          \n       date will be on the business day       \n       prior to the interest reset date;      \n                                              \n                                              \n       for CMT rate debt securities, the      \n  \u25cf    interest determination date will be    \n       the second business day prior to the   \n       interest reset date;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       for EURIBOR debt securities, the       \n       interest determination date will be    \n  \u25cf    the second TARGET Settlement Day       \n       prior to                               \n       the interest reset date;               \n                                              \n                                              \n       for Treasury rate debt securities,     \n       the interest determination date will   \n       be the day of the week in which the    \n       interest reset date falls on which     \n       Treasury bills would normally be       \n       auctioned. Treasury bills are          \n       normally sold at auction on Monday of  \n       each week, unless that day is a legal  \n       holiday, in which case the auction is  \n       normally held on the following         \n  \u25cf    Tuesday, except that the auction may   \n       be held on the preceding Friday;       \n       provided, however, that if an auction  \n       is held on the Friday of the week      \n       preceding the interest reset date,     \n       the interest determination date will   \n       be that preceding Friday; and          \n       provided, further, that if Treasury    \n       bills are sold at an auction that      \n       falls on a day that is an interest     \n       reset date, that interest reset date   \n       will be the following business day;    \n                                              \n                                              \n       for debt securities with two or more   \n       base rates, the interest               \n       determination date will be the latest  \n  \u25cf    business day                           \n       that is at least two business days     \n       before the applicable interest reset   \n       date on which each base rate is        \n       determinable; and                      \n                                              \n                                              \n       for any other in advance base rate,    \n  \u25cf    the interest determination date, if    \n       applicable, will be specified in the   \n       applicable prospectus supplement.      \n                                              \nThe interest reset dates will be specified in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement. If an\ninterest reset date for any floating rate debt\nsecurity governed by this section \u0093\u0097How\nCertain Floating Interest Rates Are Reset\u0094\nfalls on a day that is not business day, it\nwill be postponed to the following business\nday, except that, in the case of a EURIBOR\ndebt security, if that business day is in the\nnext calendar month, the interest reset date\nwill be the immediately preceding business day\nunless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. How Interest Is\nCalculated. Interest on floating rate debt\nsecurities will accrue from, and including,\nthe most recent interest payment date to which\ninterest has been paid or duly provided for\nor, if no interest has been paid or duly\nprovided for, from, and including, the issue\ndate or any other date specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement on which\ninterest begins to accrue to, but excluding,\nthe next interest payment date or, if earlier,\nthe date on which the principal has been paid\nor duly made available for payment, except as\ndescribed below under \u0093\u0097If A Payment Date Is\nNot A Business Day\u0094 (each such period, an \u0093\ninterest period\u0094). The calculation agent for\nany issue of floating rate debt securities\nwill be specified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement and may be one of our affiliates.\nWe may appoint a successor to any calculation\nagent with the written consent of the paying\nagent, which consent shall not be unreasonably\nwithheld. Upon the request of the holder of\nany floating rate debt security for which the\nbase rate is an in advance base rate, the\ncalculation agent will provide the interest\nrate then in effect and, if determined, the\ninterest rate that will become effective on\nthe next interest reset date for such floating\nrate debt security. Upon the request of the\nholder of any Compounded SOFR note, the\ncalculation agent will provide Compounded\nSOFR, the interest rate and the amount of\ninterest accrued with respect to any interest\nperiod for such Compounded SOFR note, after\nCompounded SOFR and such interest rate and\naccrued interest have been determined. The\ncalculation agent will notify the paying agent\nof each determination of the interest rate\napplicable to any floating rate debt security\npromptly after the determination is made. 25\n\nThe amount of accrued interest on a floating\nrate debt security for an interest period is\ncalculated by multiplying the principal amount\nof such floating rate debt security by an\naccrued interest factor. This accrued interest\nfactor will be determined by multiplying the\nper annum floating interest rate determined by\nreference to the applicable base rate, as\ndetermined for the applicable interest period,\nby a factor resulting from the day count\nconvention that applies with respect to such\ndetermination. The factor resulting from the\nday count convention will be, if so specified\nin the applicable prospectus supplement, one\nof the following, or may be any other\nconvention set forth in the applicable\nprospectus supplement:\n                                              \n       a factor based on a 360-day year of    \n       twelve                                 \n  \u25cf    30-day months if the day count         \n       convention specified in the            \n       applicable prospectus supplement is    \n       \u009330/360\u0094;                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       a factor equal to the actual number    \n       of days in the relevant period         \n  \u25cf    divided by 360 if the day count        \n       convention                             \n       specified in the applicable            \n       prospectus supplement is \u0093Actual/360\u0094;   \n                                              \n                                              \n       a factor equal to the actual number    \n       of days in the relevant period         \n       divided by 365, or if any portion of   \n       that                                   \n       relevant period falls in a leap year,  \n       the sum of (A)\u00a0the actual number of    \n       days in that portion of the relevant   \n  \u25cf    period falling in a leap year divided  \n       by 366 and (B)\u00a0the actual number of    \n       days in that portion of the relevant   \n       period falling in                      \n       a non-leap year divided by 365, if     \n       the day count convention specified in  \n       the applicable prospectus supplement   \n       is \u0093Actual/Actual\u0094; or                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       a factor equal to the actual number    \n       of days in the relevant period         \n       divided by 365, if the day count       \n  \u25cf    convention                             \n       specified in the applicable            \n       prospectus supplement is \u0093Actual/365    \n       (Fixed).\u0094                               \n                                              \nIf no day count convention is specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, the factor\nresulting from the day count convention will\nbe:\n                                              \n       Actual/360, in the case of Compounded  \n       SOFR notes, EURIBOR debt securities,   \n  \u25cf    federal funds (effective) rate debt    \n       securities and prime rate debt         \n       securities; and                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Actual/Actual in the case of Treasury  \n  \u25cf    rate debt securities and CMT rate      \n       debt securities.                       \n                                              \nOn or before the relevant \u0093 calculation date,\u0094\nthe calculation agent will calculate the\namount of interest that has accrued during\neach interest period.

See\n\u0093\u0097Base Rates\u0097Compounded SOFR Notes\u0094 for\nadditional information regarding the\ndetermination of Compounded SOFR. For any\nfloating rate debt securities for which the\nspecified base rate is an in advance base\nrate, the calculation date pertaining to an\ninterest payment date will be the earlier of:\n                                              \n       the tenth calendar day after the       \n       applicable interest determination      \n       date for the interest period to which  \n  \u25cf    such                                   \n       interest payment date relates or, if   \n       that day is not a business day, the    \n       next succeeding business day; or       \n                                              \n                                              \n       the business day immediately           \n       preceding such interest payment date   \n  \u25cf    or maturity date or, for any           \n       principal amount                       \n       to be redeemed or repaid, any          \n       redemption or repayment date.          \n                                              \nUnless otherwise indicated in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, all percentages used in\nor resulting from any calculation of the rate\nof interest on a floating rate debt security\nwill be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest\none hundred-thousandth of a percentage point,\nwith 0.000005% rounded up to 0.00001%, and all\n26\n\nU.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from\nthese calculations on floating rate debt\nsecurities will be rounded to the nearest\ncent, with one-half cent\nrounded upward.

All amounts denominated\nin any other currency used in or resulting\nfrom these calculations\nwill be rounded to the nearest two decimal\nplaces in that currency, with 0.005 rounded up\nto 0.01.\n\nWhen Interest Is Paid. We will\npay interest on floating rate debt securities\non the interest payment dates specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. However,\nunless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, if the first interest\npayment date is less\nthan 15 calendar days after the issue date,\ninterest will not be paid on the first\ninterest payment date, but will be paid on the\nsecond interest payment date.\n\nIf A Payment Date Is Not A Business Day.If any\ninterest payment date, other than the maturity\ndate or any earlier redemption or\nrepayment date, for any floating rate debt\nsecurity falls on a day that is not a business\nday, it will be postponed to the following\nbusiness day, except that, in the case of a\nCompounded SOFR note or a EURIBOR debt\nsecurity, if that business day\nwould fall in the next calendar month, the\ninterest payment date will be the immediately\npreceding business day unless otherwise\nspecified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. If the maturity date or any\nearlier redemption or repayment date of a\nfloating rate debt security falls on a day\nthat is not a business day, the payment of\nprincipal, premium, if any, and interest, if\nany, will be made on the next business day,\nbut interest on that payment will not accrue\nduring the period from and\nafter the maturity, redemption or repayment\ndate, as the case may be.\n\nBase Rates.\n\n.\n\nThe rate of interest on Compounded SOFR notes\nwill be based on a compounded average of the\ndaily Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\u0093\u0094), and any spread and/or spread multiplier\nand will be subject to the minimum interest\nrate and the maximum interest rate, if any.\n\nReferences to \u0093\u0094 in this section \u0093\u0097Compounded\nSOFR Notes\u0094 and under \u0093Risk Factors\u0097Risks\nRelating To SOFR, Compounded SOFR And A\nBenchmark Replacement\u0094 shall mean the\ncalculation agent named in the applicable\nprospectus supplement.\n\nThe calculation agent will determine\nCompounded SOFR, the interest rate and the\namount of interest payable for each interest\nperiod in\narrears as soon as reasonably practicable on\nor after the last day of the applicable\nobservation period (as defined below), and in\nany event on or prior to the business day\nimmediately preceding the relevant interest\npayment date, and will notify us\nof Compounded SOFR and such interest rate and\nthe amount of interest payable for each\ninterest period as soon as reasonably\npracticable after such determination, but in\nany event by the business day immediately\nprior to the interest payment date.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, the \u0093\u0094 in respect of\neach\ninterest period for Compounded SOFR notes will\nbe the period from, and including, the date\nthat is two U.S. Government Securities\nBusiness Days preceding the first date in such\ninterest period to, but excluding, the date\nthat is two U.S. Government\nSecurities Business Days preceding the\ninterest payment date for such interest\nperiod.\n\nWith respect to\nthe observation period corresponding to any\ninterest period, \u0093\u0094 will be a compounded\naverage of daily SOFR over such observation\nperiod, calculated in accordance with the\n\n27\n\nformula set forth below, with the resulting\npercentage being rounded, if necessary, to the\nnearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage\npoint (0.000005 being rounded upwards to\n0.00001): where for purposes of applying the\nabove formula to the terms of the Compounded\nSOFR notes: \u0093 d 0\u0094, for any observation\nperiod, is the number of U.S. Government\nSecurities Business Days in the relevant\nobservation period; \u0093 i\u0094 is a series of whole\nnumbers from one to d 0, each representing the\nrelevant U.S. Government Securities Business\nDays in chronological order from, and\nincluding, the first U.S. Government\nSecurities Business Day in the relevant\nobservation period; \u0093 SOFR i\u0094, for any U.S.\nGovernment Securities Business Day \u0093 i\u0094 in the\nrelevant observation period, is equal to SOFR\n(as defined below) in respect of that day; \u0093 n\ni\u0094, for any U.S. Government Securities\nBusiness Day \u0093 i\u0094 in the relevant observation\nperiod, is the number of calendar days from,\nand including, such U.S. Government Securities\nBusiness Day \u0093 i\u0094 to, but excluding, the\nfollowing U.S. Government Securities Business\nDay (\u0093 i+1\u0094); and \u0093 d\u0094 is the number of\ncalendar days in the relevant observation\nperiod.

The term \u0093 ISDA Fallback\nAdjustment\u0094 means the spread adjustment (which\nmay be a positive or negative value or zero)\nthat would apply for derivatives transactions\nreferencing the ISDA Definitions to be\ndetermined upon the occurrence of an index\ncessation event with respect to the Benchmark\nfor the applicable tenor. The term \u0093 ISDA\nFallback Rate\u0094 means the rate that would apply\nfor derivatives transactions referencing the\nISDA Definitions to be effective upon the\noccurrence of an index cessation date with\nrespect to the Benchmark for the applicable\ntenor excluding the applicable ISDA Fallback\nAdjustment. The term \u0093 Reference Time\u0094 with\nrespect to any determination of the Benchmark\nmeans (1) if the Benchmark is Compounded SOFR,\nthe SOFR Determination Time, and (2) if the\nBenchmark is not Compounded SOFR, the time\ndetermined by us or our designee in accordance\nwith the Benchmark Replacement Conforming\nChanges. The term \u0093 Relevant Governmental\nBody\u0094 means the FRB and/or the FRBNY, or a\ncommittee officially endorsed or convened by\nthe FRB and/or the FRBNY or any successor\nthereto. The term \u0093 Unadjusted Benchmark\nReplacement\u0094 means the Benchmark Replacement\nexcluding the Benchmark Replacement\nAdjustment. Additional Information About SOFR\nSOFR is published by the FRBNY and is intended\nto be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing\ncash overnight collateralized by Treasury\nsecurities. The FRBNY reports that SOFR\nincludes all trades in the Broad General\nCollateral Rate plus bilateral Treasury\nrepurchase agreement (repo) transactions\ncleared through the delivery-versus-payment\nservice offered by the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation (the \u0093 FICC\u0094), a subsidiary of the\nDepository Trust and Clearing Corporation (\u0093\nDTCC\u0094), and SOFR is filtered by the FRBNY to\nremove a portion of the foregoing transactions\nconsidered to be \u0093specials.\u0094 According to the\nFRBNY, \u0093specials\u0094 are repos for specific-issue\ncollateral, which take place at cash-lending\nrates below those for general collateral repos\nbecause cash providers are willing to accept a\nlesser return on their cash in order to obtain\na particular security. The FRBNY reports that\nSOFR is calculated as a volume-weighted median\nof transaction-level tri-partyrepo data\ncollected from The Bank of New York Mellon as\nwell as General Collateral Finance Repo\ntransaction data and data on bilateral\nTreasury repo transactions cleared through the\nFICC\u0092s delivery-versus-payment service. The\nFRBNY also notes that it obtains information\nfrom DTCC Solutions LLC, an affiliate of DTCC.\nIf data for a given market segment were\nunavailable for any day, then the most\nrecently available data for that segment would\nbe utilized, with the rates on each\ntransaction from that day adjusted to account\nfor any change in the level of market rates in\nthat segment over the intervening period. SOFR\nwould be calculated from this adjusted prior\nday\u0092s data for segments where current data\nwere unavailable, and unadjusted data for any\n31\n\nsegments where data were available. To\ndetermine the change in the level of market\nrates over the intervening period for the\nmissing market segment, the FRBNY would use\ninformation collected through a daily survey\nconducted by its Trading Desk of primary\ndealers\u0092 repo borrowing activity. Such daily\nsurvey would include information reported by\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, our wholly owned\nsubsidiary, as a primary dealer. If data other\nthan those provided by The Bank of New York\nMellon or DTCC Solutions LLC are used in the\ncalculation of SOFR, the change in source will\nbe noted by the SOFR Administrator when the\nrate is published. The FRBNY notes on its\npublication page for SOFR that use of SOFR is\nsubject to important limitations,\nindemnification obligations and disclaimers,\nincluding that the FRBNY may alter the methods\nof calculation, publication schedule, rate\nrevision practices or availability of SOFR at\nany time without notice. On each U.S.\nGovernment Securities Business Day, the SOFR\nAdministrator publishes SOFR on its website at\napproximately 8:00 a.m., New York City time\nfor trades made on the immediately preceding\nU.S. Government Securities Business Day. If\nerrors are discovered in the transaction data\nprovided by The Bank of New York Mellon or\nDTCC Solutions LLC, or in the calculation\nprocess, subsequent to the initial publication\nof SOFR but on that same day, SOFR and the\naccompanying summary statistics may be\nrepublished at approximately 2:30 p.m., New\nYork City time. Additionally, if transaction\ndata from The Bank of New York Mellon or DTCC\nSolutions LLC had previously not been\navailable in time for publication, but became\navailable later in the day, the affected rate\nor rates may be republished at around this\ntime. Rate revisions will only be effected on\nthe same day as initial publication and will\nonly be republished if the change in the rate\nexceeds one basis point (0.01%). Any time a\nrate is revised, a footnote to the FRBNY\u0092s\npublication would indicate the revision. This\nrevision threshold will be reviewed\nperiodically by the FRBNY and may be changed\nbased on market conditions. Because SOFR is\npublished by the SOFR Administrator based on\ndata received from other sources, we have no\ncontrol over its determination, calculation or\npublication.

In determining the Treasury\nRate, we shall select, as applicable: (1) the\nyield for the Treasury constant maturity on\nH.15 exactly equal to the\nperiod from the redemption date to the First\nPar Call Date (the \u0093\u0094); or (2) if there is no\nsuch Treasury constant maturity on H.15\nexactly equal to the Remaining Life, the two\nyields\u0097one yield corresponding\nto the Treasury constant maturity on H.15\nimmediately shorter than and one yield\ncorresponding to the Treasury constant\nmaturity on H.15 immediately longer than the\nRemaining Life\u0097and shall interpolate to the\nFirst Par Call Date on a\nstraight-line basis (using the actual number\nof days) using such yields and rounding the\nresult to three decimal places; or (3) if\nthere is no such Treasury constant maturity on\nH.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining\nLife, the yield for\nthe single Treasury constant maturity on H.15\nclosest to the Remaining Life. For purposes of\nthis paragraph, the applicable Treasury\nconstant maturity or maturities on H.15 shall\nbe deemed to have a maturity date equal to the\nrelevant number of\nmonths or years, as applicable, of such\nTreasury constant maturity from the redemption\ndate.\n\nIf on the third business day preceding the\nredemption date H.15 TCM (or any successor\ndesignation or publication) is no longer\npublished, we shall calculate the Treasury\nRate based on the rate per annum equal to the\nsemi-annual equivalent yield to maturity at\n11:00 a.m., New York City time,\non the second business day preceding such\nredemption date of the United States Treasury\nsecurity maturing on, or with a maturity that\nis closest to, the First Par Call Date, as\napplicable. If there is no United States\nTreasury security maturing on\nthe First Par Call Date but there are two or\nmore United States Treasury securities with a\nmaturity date equally distant from the First\nPar Call Date, one with a maturity date\npreceding the First Par Call Date and one with\na maturity date following\nthe First Par Call Date, we shall select the\nUnited States Treasury security with a\nmaturity date preceding the First Par Call\nDate. If there are two or more United States\nTreasury securities maturing on the First Par\nCall Date or two or more United\nStates Treasury securities meeting the\ncriteria of the preceding sentence, we shall\nselect from among these two or more United\nStates Treasury securities the United States\nTreasury security that is trading closest to\npar based upon the average of\nthe bid and asked prices for such United\nStates Treasury securities at 11:00 a.m., New\nYork City time. In determining the Treasury\nRate in accordance with the terms of this\nparagraph, the semi-annual yield to maturity\nof the applicable United States\nTreasury security shall be based upon the\naverage of the bid and asked prices (expressed\nas a percentage of principal amount) at 11:00\na.m., New York City time, of such United\nStates Treasury security, and rounded to three\ndecimal places.\n\nOur actions and determinations in determining\nthe redemption price shall be conclusive and\nbinding for all purposes, absent manifest\nerror.\n\nAny redemption price will be expressed as a\npercentage of principal amount and rounded to\nthree decimal places.\n\nRepayment At Option Of Holder. If applicable,\nthe prospectus supplement relating to a series\nof debt securities will indicate that the\nholder has the option to have us repay the\ndebt security on a date or dates\n\n41\n\nspecified prior to its stated maturity date.\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, the repayment price\nwill be equal to 100% of the principal amount\nof the debt security, together with accrued\ninterest, if any, to the date of repayment.\nFor debt securities issued with original issue\ndiscount, the applicable prospectus supplement\nwill specify the amount payable upon\nrepayment. For us to repay a debt security,\nthe paying agent must receive at least 30 days\nbut not more than 45 days prior to the\nrepayment date:\n                                              \n       the debt security with the form        \n  \u25cf    entitled \u0093Option to Elect Repayment\u0094 on  \n       the reverse of debt security           \n       duly completed; or                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       a telegram, telex, facsimile           \n       transmission or a letter from a        \n       member of a national securities        \n       exchange, or the                       \n       Financial Industry Regulatory          \n       Authority, Inc. (\u0093FINRA\u0094) or a           \n       commercial bank or trust company in    \n       the United States setting forth the    \n       name of the holder of the debt         \n       security, the principal amount of the  \n       debt security, the principal           \n       amount of the debt security to be      \n       repaid, the certificate number or a    \n       description of the tenor and terms of  \n       the debt security, a statement that    \n       the option to elect repayment is       \n       being exercised and a guarantee that   \n  \u25cf    the debt security to be repaid,        \n       together with the duly completed form  \n       entitled \u0093Option to Elect Repayment\u0094 on  \n       the reverse of the debt security,      \n       will be received by the paying agent   \n       not later than the fifth business day  \n       after the date of the telegram,        \n       telex, facsimile                       \n       transmission or letter. However, the   \n       telegram, telex, facsimile             \n       transmission or letter will only be    \n       effective if that debt security and    \n       form duly completed are received by    \n       the paying agent by the fifth          \n       business day after the date of that    \n       telegram,                              \n       telex, facsimile transmission or       \n       letter.                                \n                                              \nExercise of the repayment option by the holder\nof a debt security will be irrevocable. The\nholder may exercise the repayment option for\nless than the entire principal amount of the\ndebt security but, in that event, the\nprincipal amount of the debt security\nremaining outstanding after repayment must be\nan authorized denomination. If a debt security\nis represented by a global security, the\ndepositary or the depositary\u0092s nominee will be\nthe holder of the debt security and therefore\nwill be the only entity that can exercise a\nright to repayment. In order to ensure that\nthe depositary\u0092s nominee will timely exercise\na right to repayment of a particular debt\nsecurity, the beneficial owner of the debt\nsecurity must instruct the broker or other\ndirect or indirect participant through which\nit holds an interest in the debt security to\nnotify the depositary of its desire to\nexercise a right to repayment. Different firms\nhave different cut-offtimes for accepting\ninstructions from their customers and,\naccordingly, each beneficial owner should\nconsult the broker or other direct or indirect\nparticipant through which it holds an interest\nin a debt security in order to ascertain the\ncut-offtime by which an instruction must be\ngiven in order for timely notice to be\ndelivered to the depositary. We may purchase\ndebt securities at any price in the open\nmarket or otherwise. Debt securities so\npurchased by us may, at our discretion, be\nheld or resold or surrendered to the\napplicable trustee for cancellation.\nDenominations Unless we state otherwise in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, the debt\nsecurities will be issued only in registered\nform, without coupons, in denominations of\n$1,000 each and integral multiples of $1,000\nin excess thereof. Bearer Debt Securities If\nwe ever issue bearer debt securities, the\napplicable prospectus supplement will describe\nall of the special terms and provisions of\ndebt securities in bearer form, and the extent\nto which those special terms and 42\n\nprovisions are different from the terms and\nprovisions which are described in this\nprospectus, which generally apply to debt\nsecurities in registered form, and will\nsummarize provisions of the applicable\nindenture that relate specifically to bearer\ndebt securities. Original Issue Discount Debt\nsecurities may be issued under the indentures\nas original issue discount securities and sold\nat a substantial discount below their stated\nprincipal amount. If a debt security is an\noriginal issue discount security, that means\nthat an amount less than the principal amount\nof the debt security will be due and payable\nupon a declaration of acceleration of the\nmaturity of the debt security under the\napplicable indenture.

The subordinated\nindenture does not contain the provision\ndescribed in the preceding paragraph. Each of\nthe indentures requires us to file an\nofficers\u0092 certificate with the applicable\ntrustee each year that states, to the\nknowledge of the certifying officer, whether\nor not any defaults exist under the terms of\nthe applicable indenture.

The trustee may\nwithhold notice to the holders of debt\nsecurities of any default, except defaults in\nthe payment of principal, premium, interest or\nany sinking fund installment, if it considers\nthe withholding of notice to be in the 47\n\nbest interests of the holders.

Notwithstanding the\nsubordination provisions discussed in this\nparagraph, holders of subordinated debt\nsecurities will not be required to pay, or\ntransfer payments or distributions to, holders\nof Senior Debt so long as:\n                                              \n       the payments or distributions consist  \n  \u25cf    of securities issued by us or another  \n       company in connection with a plan of   \n       reorganization or readjustment; and    \n                                              \n                                              \n       payment on those securities is         \n       subordinate to outstanding Senior      \n       Debt and any securities issued with    \n       respect to                             \n       Senior Debt under such plan of         \n  \u25cf    reorganization or readjustment at      \n       least to the same extent provided in   \n       the subordination provisions of those  \n       subordinated debt securities.          \n       (Section 1801 of the subordinated      \n       indenture)                             \n                                              \nBecause of the subordination, if we become\ninsolvent, holders of Senior Debt may receive\nmore, ratably, and holders of the subordinated\ndebt securities having a claim pursuant to\nthose securities may receive less, ratably,\nthan our other creditors. Holders of our\nsubordinated debt securities may also be fully\nsubordinated to interests held by the U.S.\ngovernment in the event that we enter into a\nreceivership, insolvency, liquidation or\nsimilar proceeding. We may modify or amend the\nsubordinated indenture as provided under\n\u0093\u0097Modification and Waiver\u0094 above. However, the\nmodification or amendment may not, without the\nconsent of the holders of all Senior Debt\noutstanding, modify any of the provisions of\nthe applicable indenture relating to the\nsubordination of the subordinated debt\nsecurities in a manner that would adversely\naffect the holders of Senior Debt. (Section\n902 of the subordinated indenture) Payment of\nAdditional Amounts Unless we specify otherwise\nin the applicable prospectus supplement, we\nwill not pay any additional amounts on the\ndebt securities offered thereby to compensate\nany beneficial owner for any United States tax\nwithheld from payments on such debt\nsecurities. If we specify that we will pay\nadditional amounts in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, we will, subject to the\nexemptions and limitations set forth below,\npay additional amounts on the debt securities\nwith respect to any beneficial owner of the\ndebt securities that is a Non-U.S.Holder to\nensure that each net payment to that\nNon-U.S.Holder on debt securities that it\nbeneficially owns will not be less, due to the\npayment of United States withholding tax, than\nthe amount then otherwise due and payable. In\nno event will we be obligated to pay 51\n\nadditional amounts that exceed the amount\nrequired to do so. For this purpose, a \u0093 net\npayment\u0094 on a debt security means a payment by\nus, or any paying agent, including payment of\nprincipal and interest, after deduction for\nany present or future tax, assessment, or\nother governmental charge of the United\nStates. If paid, these additional amounts will\nconstitute additional interest on the debt\nsecurities. See \u0093United States Federal Income\nTax Considerations\u0094 for the definition of\n\u0093Non-U.S.Holder.\u0094 \u0093 United States\u0094 means the\nUnited States of America, including each state\nof the United States and the District of\nColumbia, its territories, its possessions,\nand other areas within its jurisdiction. For\nthis purpose, United States withholding tax\nmeans a withholding tax of the United States,\nother than a territory or possession. Even if\nwe specify that we will pay additional amounts\nin the applicable prospectus supplement, we\nwill not be required to pay additional amounts\nto a Non-U.S.Holder in any of the\ncircumstances described in items (1) through\n(14) below. (1) Additional amounts will not be\npayable if a payment on the debt securities is\nreduced as a result of any tax, assessment, or\nother governmental charge that is imposed or\nwithheld solely by reason of the beneficial\nowner:\n                                              \n       having a relationship with the United  \n  \u25cf    States as a citizen, resident, or      \n       otherwise having a present connection  \n       with the United States;                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25cf    having had such a relationship in the  \n       past; or                               \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25cf    being considered as having had such a  \n       relationship.                          \n                                              \n(2) Additional amounts will not be payable if\na payment on the debt securities is reduced as\na result of any tax, assessment, or other\ngovernmental charge that is imposed or\nwithheld solely by reason of the beneficial\nowner:\n                                              \n       being treated as present in or         \n  \u25cf    engaged in a trade or business in the  \n       United States;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       being treated as having been present   \n  \u25cf    in or engaged in a trade or business   \n       in the United States in the past;      \n                                              \n                                              \n       having or having had a permanent       \n  \u25cf    establishment in the United States;    \n       or                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       having or having had a qualified       \n  \u25cf    business unit which has the U.S.       \n       dollar as its functional currency.     \n                                              \n(3) Additional amounts will not be payable if\na payment on the debt securities is reduced as\na result of any tax, assessment, or other\ngovernmental charge that is imposed or\nwithheld solely by reason of the beneficial\nowner being or having been a (as each term is\ndefined in the Code):\n                                  \n  \u25cf    personal holding company;  \n                                  \n                                          \n  \u25cf    foreign personal holding company;  \n                                          \n                                              \n  \u25cf    foreign private foundation or other    \n       foreign exempt organization;           \n                                              \n                                            \n  \u25cf    passive foreign investment company;  \n                                            \n                                           \n  \u25cf    controlled foreign corporation; or  \n                                           \n                                              \n       corporation which has accumulated      \n  \u25cf    taxable income to avoid U.S. federal   \n       income tax.                            \n                                              \n52\n\n(4) Additional amounts will not be payable if\na payment on the debt securities is reduced as\na result of any tax, assessment, or other\ngovernmental charge that is imposed or\nwithheld solely by reason of the beneficial\nowner owning or having owned, actually or\nconstructively, 10% or more of the total\ncombined voting power of all classes of our\nstock entitled to vote.

The definitive\nsecurities will be registered in the names of\nthe owners of the beneficial interests in the\nglobal security as directed by DTC. 55\n\nWe will make principal and interest payments\non all debt securities represented by a global\nsecurity to the paying agent which in turn\nwill make payment to DTC or its nominee, as\nthe case may be, as the sole registered owner\nand the sole holder of the debt securities\nrepresented by a global security for all\npurposes under the applicable indenture.\nAccordingly, we, the applicable trustee and\nany paying agent will have no responsibility\nor liability for:\n                                              \n       any aspect of DTC\u0092s records relating    \n       to, or payments made on account of,    \n  \u25cf    beneficial ownership interests in a    \n       debt security represented by a global  \n       security;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       any other aspect of the relationship   \n       between DTC and its participants or    \n       the relationship between those         \n  \u25cf    participants and the owners of         \n       beneficial interests in a global       \n       security held through those            \n       participants; or                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       the maintenance, supervision or        \n       review of any of DTC\u0092s records          \n  \u25cf    relating to those beneficial           \n       ownership                              \n       interests.                             \n                                              \nDTC\u0092s current practice is to credit direct\nparticipants\u0092 accounts on each payment date\nwith payments in amounts proportionate to\ntheir respective beneficial interests in the\nprincipal amount of such global security as\nshown on DTC\u0092s records, upon DTC\u0092s receipt of\nfunds and corresponding detail information.\nThe underwriters or agents for the debt\nsecurities represented by a global security\nwill initially designate the accounts to be\ncredited. Payments by participants to owners\nof beneficial interests in a global security\nwill be governed by standing instructions and\ncustomary practices, as is the case with\nsecurities held for customer accounts\nregistered in \u0093street name,\u0094 and will be the\nsole responsibility of those participants, and\nnot of DTC or its nominee, the applicable\ntrustee, any agent of ours, or us, subject to\nany statutory or regulatory requirements.\nBook-entry notes may be more difficult to\npledge because of the lack of a physical note.\nDTC So long as DTC or its nominee is the\nregistered owner of a global security, DTC or\nits nominee, as the case may be, will be\nconsidered the sole owner and holder of the\ndebt securities represented by that global\nsecurity for all purposes of the debt\nsecurities. Owners of beneficial interests in\nthe debt securities will not be entitled to\nhave debt securities registered in their\nnames, will not receive or be entitled to\nreceive physical delivery of the debt\nsecurities in definitive form and will not be\nconsidered owners or holders of debt\nsecurities under the applicable indenture.\nAccordingly, each person owning a beneficial\ninterest in a global security must rely on the\nprocedures of DTC and, if that person is not a\nDTC participant, on the procedures of the\nparticipant through which that person owns its\ninterest, to exercise any rights of a holder\nof debt securities. The laws of some\njurisdictions may require that certain\npurchasers of securities take physical\ndelivery of the securities in certificated\nform. These laws may impair the ability to\ntransfer beneficial interests in a global\nsecurity. Beneficial owners may experience\ndelays in receiving distributions on their\ndebt securities since distributions will\ninitially be made to DTC and must then be\ntransferred through the chain of\nintermediaries to the beneficial owner\u0092s\naccount. We understand that, under existing\nindustry practices, if we request holders to\ntake any action, or if an owner of a\nbeneficial interest in a global security\ndesires to take any action which a holder is\nentitled to take under the applicable\nindenture, then DTC would authorize the\nparticipants holding the relevant beneficial\ninterests to take that action and those\nparticipants would authorize the beneficial\nowners owning through such participants to\ntake that action or would otherwise act upon\nthe instructions of beneficial owners owning\nthrough them. Beneficial interests in a global\nsecurity will be shown on, and transfers of\nthose ownership interests will be effected\nonly through, records maintained by DTC and\nits participants for that global security. The\nconveyance of notices and other communications\nby DTC to its participants and by its\nparticipants to owners of beneficial interests\nin the debt securities will be governed by\narrangements among them, subject to any\nstatutory or regulatory requirements in\neffect. 56\n\nDTC is a limited-purpose trust company\norganized under the New York banking law, a\n\u0093banking organization\u0094 within the meaning of\nthe New York Banking Law, a member of the\nFederal Reserve System, a \u0093clearing\ncorporation\u0094 within the meaning of the New\nYork Uniform Commercial Code and a \u0093clearing\nagency\u0094\nregistered under the Exchange Act. DTC is a\nwholly owned subsidiary of The Depository\nTrust & Clearing Corporation (\u0093\u0094). DTCC is the\nholding company for DTC, National Securities\nClearing Corporation and Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation, all of which are\nregistered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by\nthe users of its regulated subsidiaries.\n\nDTC holds\nthe securities of its participants and\nfacilitates the clearance and settlement of\nsecurities transactions among its participants\nin such securities through electronic book-\nentry changes in accounts of its participants.\nThe electronic book-entry\nsystem eliminates the need for physical\ncertificates. DTC\u0092s participants include\nsecurities brokers and dealers, including\nunderwriters, banks, trust companies, clearing\ncorporations and certain other organizations,\nsome of which, and/or their\nrepresentatives, own DTCC. Banks, brokers,\ndealers, trust companies and others that clear\nthrough or maintain a custodial relationship\nwith a participant, either directly or\nindirectly, also have access to DTC\u0092s book-\nentry system. The rules\napplicable to DTC and its participants are on\nfile with the SEC.\n\nDTC has indicated that the above information\nwith respect to DTC has\nbeen provided to its participants and other\nmembers of the financial community for\ninformational purposes only and is not\nintended to serve as a representation,\nwarranty or contract modification of any kind.\n\nClearstream\n\nClearstream is incorporated under the laws of\nLuxembourg as an international clearing\nsystem. Clearstream holds securities for its\nparticipating organizations, or \u0093,\u0094 and\nfacilitates the clearance and settlement of\nsecurities transactions between Clearstream\nParticipants through electronic book-entry\nchanges in accounts of Clearstream\nParticipants, thereby eliminating the need for\nphysical movement of certificates. Clearstream\nprovides to Clearstream Participants, among\nother things, services for safekeeping,\nadministration, clearance and settlement of\ninternationally traded\nsecurities and securities lending and\nborrowing. Clearstream interfaces with\ndomestic securities markets in several\ncountries. As a professional depositary,\nClearstream is subject to regulation by the\nLuxembourg Commission for the Supervision of\nthe\nFinancial Sector (Commission de Surveillance\ndu Secteur Financier). Clearstream\nParticipants are recognized financial\ninstitutions around the world, including\nunderwriters, securities brokers and dealers,\nbanks, trust companies, clearing\ncorporations and certain other organizations.\nClearstream\u0092s U.S. Participants are limited to\nsecurities brokers and dealers and banks.\nIndirect access to Clearstream is also\navailable to others, such as banks, brokers,\ndealers and trust\ncompanies that clear through or maintain a\ncustodial relationship with a Clearstream\nParticipant either directly or indirectly.\n\nDistributions with respect to debt securities\nheld beneficially through Clearstream will be\ncredited to cash accounts of Clearstream\nParticipants in accordance with its rules and\nprocedures, to the extent received by the U.S.\nDepositary for Clearstream.\n\nEuroclear\n\nEuroclear was created in 1968 to hold\nsecurities for participants of Euroclear, or\n\u0093,\u0094\nand to clear and settle transactions between\nEuroclear Participants through simultaneous\nelectronic book-entry delivery against\npayment, thereby eliminating the need for\nphysical movement of certificates and any risk\nfrom lack of simultaneous\ntransfers of securities and cash. Euroclear\nperforms various other services, including\nsecurities lending and borrowing and interacts\nwith domestic markets in several countries.\nEuroclear is operated by Euroclear Bank\nS.A./N.V., or the\n\u0093,\u0094 under contract with Euroclear plc, a U.K.\ncorporation. All operations are conducted by\nthe Euroclear Operator, and all Euroclear\nsecurities clearance accounts and Euroclear\ncash accounts are accounts with the\nEuroclear Operator, not Euroclear plc.\nEuroclear plc\n\n57\n\nestablishes policy for Euroclear on behalf of\nEuroclear Participants. Euroclear Participants\ninclude banks, including central banks,\nsecurities brokers and dealers and other\nprofessional\nfinancial intermediaries. Indirect access to\nEuroclear is also available to other firms\nthat clear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a Euroclear Participant,\neither directly or indirectly. Euroclear is an\nindirect participant in DTC.\n\nThe Euroclear Operator is a Belgian bank. As\nsuch it is regulated by the Belgian Banking\nand Finance Commission and the National Bank\nof\nBelgium.\n\nSecurities clearance accounts and cash\naccounts with the Euroclear Operator are\ngoverned by the Terms and Conditions Governing\nUse of Euroclear and the related Operating\nProcedures of the Euroclear System, and\napplicable Belgian law, which we will refer to\nherein as the \u0093.\u0094 The Terms and Conditions\ngovern transfers of securities and cash\nwithin Euroclear, withdrawals of securities\nand cash from Euroclear, and receipts of\npayments with respect to securities in\nEuroclear. All securities in Euroclear are\nheld on a fungible basis without attribution\nof specific certificates to specific\nsecurities clearance accounts. The Euroclear\nOperator acts under the Terms and Conditions\nonly on behalf of Euroclear Participants, and\nhas no record of or relationship with persons\nholding through Euroclear Participants.\n\nDistributions with respect to debt securities\nheld beneficially through Euroclear will be\ncredited to the cash accounts of Euroclear\nParticipants in accordance with the Terms and\nConditions, to the extent received by the\nEuroclear Operator.\n\nInvestors that acquire, hold\nand transfer interests in the debt securities\nby book-entry through accounts with the\nEuroclear Operator or any other securities\nintermediary are subject to the laws and\ncontractual provisions governing their\nrelationship with such intermediary, as\nwell as the laws and contractual provisions\ngoverning the relationship between such an\nintermediary and each other intermediary, if\nany, standing between themselves and the\nglobal securities.\n\nGlobal Clearance and Settlement Procedures\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, initial settlement for\nthe debt securities will be made in\nimmediately\navailable funds. Secondary market trading\nbetween DTC participants will occur in the\nordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and\nwill be settled in immediately available funds\nusing DTC\u0092s Same-Day Funds\nSettlement System. Secondary market trading\nbetween Clearstream Participants and/or\nEuroclear Participants will occur in the\nordinary way in accordance with the applicable\nrules and operating procedures of Clearstream\nand Euroclear and will be\nsettled using the procedures applicable to\nconventional eurobonds in immediately\navailable funds.\n\nCross-market transfers between persons\nholding directly or indirectly through DTC, on\nthe one hand, and directly or indirectly\nthrough Clearstream Participants or Euroclear\nParticipants, on the other, will be effected\nthrough DTC in accordance with DTC rules on\nbehalf of the relevant\nEuropean international clearing system by its\nU.S. Depositary; however, such cross-market\ntransactions will require delivery of\ninstructions to the relevant European\ninternational clearing system by the\ncounterparty in such system in accordance with\nits rules and procedures and within its\nestablished deadlines (European time). The\nrelevant European international clearing\nsystem will, if the transaction meets its\nsettlement requirements, deliver instructions\nto its U.S. Depositary to take action\nto effect final settlement on its behalf by\ndelivering or receiving debt securities\nthrough DTC, and making or receiving payment\nin accordance with normal procedures for same-\nday funds settlement applicable to\nDTC. Clearstream Participants and Euroclear\nParticipants may not deliver instructions\ndirectly to their respective U.S.\nDepositaries.\n\nBecause of time-zone differences, credits of\ndebt securities received through Clearstream\nor Euroclear as a result of a transaction with\na\nDTC participant will be made during subsequent\nsecurities settlement processing and dated the\nbusiness day following the DTC settlement\ndate. Such credits or any transactions in\n\n58\n\nsuch debt securities settled during such\nprocessing will be reported to the relevant\nEuroclear Participants or Clearstream\nParticipants on such business day. Cash\nreceived in Clearstream or\nEuroclear as a result of sales of debt\nsecurities by or through a Clearstream\nParticipant or a Euroclear Participant to a\nDTC participant will be received with value on\nthe DTC settlement date but will be available\nin the relevant Clearstream or\nEuroclear cash account only as of the business\nday following settlement in DTC.\n\nIf the debt securities are cleared only\nthrough\nEuroclear and Clearstream (and not DTC), you\nwill be able to make and receive through\nEuroclear and Clearstream payments,\ndeliveries, transfers, exchanges, notices, and\nother transactions involving any securities\nheld through those systems only on\ndays when those systems are open for business.\nThose systems may not be open for business on\ndays when banks, brokers, and other\ninstitutions are open for business in the\nUnited States. In addition, because of time-\nzone differences, U.S. investors\nwho hold their interests in the securities\nthrough these systems and wish to transfer\ntheir interests, or to receive or make a\npayment or delivery or exercise any other\nright with respect to their interests, on a\nparticular day may find that the\ntransaction will not be effected until the\nnext business day in Luxembourg or Brussels,\nas applicable. Thus, U.S. investors who wish\nto exercise rights that expire on a particular\nday may need to act before the expiration\ndate.\n\nAlthough DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have\nagreed to the foregoing procedures in order to\nfacilitate transfers of debt securities among\nparticipants of DTC, Clearstream and\nEuroclear, they are under no obligation to\nperform or continue to perform such procedures\nand such procedures may be modified or\ndiscontinued at any time. Neither we nor any\npaying agent will have any\nresponsibility for the performance by DTC,\nEuroclear or Clearstream or their respective\ndirect or indirect participants of their\nobligations under the rules and procedures\ngoverning their operations.\n\nConversion and Exchange\n\nIf any offered\ndebt securities are convertible into preferred\nstock, depositary shares or common stock at\nthe option of the holders or exchangeable for\npreferred stock, depositary shares or common\nstock at our option, the prospectus supplement\nrelating to those\ndebt securities will include the terms and\nconditions governing any conversions and\nexchanges.\n\nThe Trustees\n\nFrom time to time, Wells Fargo and certain of\nits subsidiaries maintain deposit accounts and\nconduct other banking transactions, including\nlending transactions, with the senior trustee\nand an affiliate of the subordinated trustee\nin the ordinary course of business.\n\nNotices\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, any notices required to\nbe given to the holders of the debt securities\nin\nglobal form will be given to the depositary.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe indentures are, and the debt securities\nwill be, governed by and will be construed in\naccordance with New York law.\n\n59\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK This section\ndescribes the general terms and provisions of\nour preferred stock and preference stock that\nmay be offered by this prospectus. Unless we\nspecifically note otherwise, we will generally\nrefer to our preferred stock and preference\nstock collectively in this prospectus as \u0093\npreferred stock.\u0094 The prospectus supplement\nwill describe the specific terms of the series\nof the preferred stock offered through that\nprospectus supplement and any general terms\noutlined in this section that will not apply\nto that series of preferred stock. We have\nsummarized the material terms and provisions\nof the preferred stock in this section.

As described under\n\u0093Description of Depositary Shares\u0094 below, we\nmay elect to offer depositary shares\nrepresented by depositary receipts. If we so\nelect, each depositary share will represent a\nfractional interest, to be specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, in a share\nof preferred stock. If we issue depositary\nshares representing interests in preferred\nstock, those shares of preferred stock will be\ndeposited with a depositary. 60\n\nUnder regulations of the FRB, our preferred\nstock may be deemed a \u0093class of voting\nsecurities\u0094 for purposes of the Bank Holding\nCompany Act because the holders of our\npreferred stock are entitled to vote for the\nelection of directors if we do not pay\npreferred stock dividends. Any holder of more\nthan 25% of a class of our voting securities,\nor less than 25% if the holder otherwise\nexercises a \u0093controlling influence\u0094 over us,\nwould be regulated as a bank holding company\nunder the Bank Holding Company Act. In\naddition, an existing bank holding company\nwould need to obtain the FRB\u0092s approval before\nacquiring more than 5% of any class of our\nvoting securities. Separately, under the\nChange in Bank Control Act of 1978, any\n\u0093person,\u0094 including an individual or company\nother than a bank holding company, may need to\nobtain the FRB\u0092s approval before acquiring 10%\nor more of any class of our voting securities.\nAll series of our preferred stock are\nconsidered a single \u0093class of voting shares\u0094\nunder the Bank Holding Company Act because\nthey generally vote together on all matters as\ndescribed below under \u0093\u0097Voting Rights.\u0094 The\npreferred stock will have the dividend,\nliquidation, redemption, voting and conversion\nrights described in this section unless the\napplicable prospectus supplement provides\notherwise.

The applicable\nprospectus supplement relating to a particular\nseries of preferred stock will describe the\ndividend rates and dates on which dividends\nwill be payable. The rates may be fixed or\nvariable or both. If the dividend rate is\nvariable, the applicable prospectus supplement\nwill describe the formula used to determine\nthe dividend rate for each dividend period. We\nwill pay dividends to the holders of record as\nthey appear on our stock books on the record\ndates fixed by our board of directors or its\nduly authorized committee. We are incorporated\nin Delaware and are governed by the General\nCorporation Law of the State of Delaware.\nDelaware law allows a corporation to pay\ndividends only out of surplus, as determined\nunder Delaware law, or, if there is no\nsurplus, out of net profits for the fiscal\nyear in which the dividend was declared and\nfor the preceding fiscal year. However, under\nDelaware law, we cannot pay dividends out of\nnet profits if, after we pay the dividend, our\ncapital would be less than the capital\nrepresented by the outstanding stock of all\nclasses having a preference upon the\ndistribution of our assets. The applicable\nprospectus supplement will also state whether\nthe dividends on any series of the preferred\nstock are cumulative or non-cumulative.If our\nboard of directors does not declare a dividend\npayable on a dividend payment date on any non-\ncumulativeseries of preferred stock, then the\nholders of that series will not be entitled to\nreceive a dividend for that dividend period\nand we will not be obligated to pay the\ndividend for that dividend period even if our\nboard declares a dividend on that series\npayable in the future. Our board will not\ndeclare and pay a dividend on any of our stock\nranking, as to dividends, equal with or junior\nto the preferred stock unless full dividends\non the preferred stock have been declared and\npaid, or declared and sufficient money is set\naside for payment. Until full dividends are\npaid, or declared and payment is set aside, on\nall preferred stock ranking equal as to\ndividends, then:\n                                              \n       we will declare any dividends pro      \n       rata among the shares of preferred     \n       stock of each series offered under     \n       this                                   \n       prospectus and any other series of     \n       preferred stock ranking equal to such  \n       series of preferred stock offered      \n  \u25cf    under this prospectus as to            \n       dividends, which means that the        \n       dividends we declare per share on      \n       each series of such preferred stock    \n       will bear                              \n       the same relationship to each other    \n       that the full accrued dividends per    \n       share on each such series of the       \n       preferred stock bear to each other;    \n                                              \n                                              \n       other than the above-described pro     \n       rata dividends, we will not declare    \n       or pay any dividends or declare or     \n       make                                   \n       any distributions upon any security    \n       ranking junior to or equal with the    \n  \u25cf    preferred stock offered under this     \n       prospectus as to dividends or upon     \n       liquidation, except dividends or       \n       distributions paid for with            \n       securities ranking junior to the       \n       preferred                              \n       stock as to dividends and upon         \n       liquidation; and                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       we will not redeem, purchase or        \n       otherwise acquire, or set aside money  \n       for a sinking fund for, any            \n       securities                             \n       ranking junior to or equal with the    \n  \u25cf    preferred stock offered under this     \n       prospectus as to dividends or upon     \n       liquidation, except by conversion      \n       into or exchange for stock junior to   \n       the preferred stock as to dividends    \n       and upon liquidation.                  \n                                              \nWe will not owe any interest, or any money in\nlieu of interest, on any dividend payment(s)\non any series of the preferred stock which may\nbe past due. Redemption Subject to receipt of\nprior approval by the FRB, if required, we may\nredeem all or part of a series of the\npreferred stock and that series may be subject\nto mandatory redemption under a sinking fund\nor otherwise, 62\n\nas described in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. Redeemed shares of preferred stock\nwill become authorized but unissued shares of\npreferred stock or preference stock, as the\ncase may be, that we may issue in the future.\nIf a series of the preferred stock is subject\nto mandatory redemption, the applicable\nprospectus supplement will specify the number\nof shares that we will redeem each year and\nthe redemption price. If shares of preferred\nstock are redeemed, we will pay all accrued\nand unpaid dividends on those shares to, but\nexcluding, the redemption date. The applicable\nprospectus supplement will also specify\nwhether the redemption price will be paid in\ncash or other property. If we are only\npermitted to pay the redemption price for a\nseries of preferred stock from the proceeds of\na capital stock issuance, and the proceeds\nfrom the issuance are insufficient or no such\nissuance has occurred, then the terms of that\nseries may provide that the preferred stock\nwill automatically and mandatorily be\nconverted into that capital stock. If fewer\nthan all of the outstanding shares of any\nseries of the preferred stock are to be\nredeemed, our board of directors will\ndetermine the number of shares to be redeemed.\nWe will redeem the shares pro rata from the\nholders of record in proportion to the number\nof shares held by them, with adjustments to\navoid redemption of fractional shares. Even\nthough the terms of a series of preferred\nstock may permit redemption of all or a part\nof the preferred stock, if any dividends,\nincluding accumulated dividends, on that\nseries are past due:\n                                              \n       we will not redeem any preferred       \n       stock of that series unless we         \n  \u25cf    simultaneously redeem all outstanding  \n       preferred                              \n       stock of that series; and              \n                                              \n                                              \n       we will not purchase or otherwise      \n  \u25cf    acquire any preferred stock of that    \n       series.                                \n                                              \nThe prohibition discussed in the prior\nsentence will not prohibit us from purchasing\nor acquiring preferred stock of that series\nunder a purchase or exchange offer if we make\nthe offer on the same terms to all holders of\nthat series. Unless the applicable prospectus\nsupplement specifies otherwise, we will give\nnotice of a redemption by mailing a notice to\neach record holder of the shares to be\nredeemed, between 30 to 60 days prior to the\ndate fixed for redemption, unless we issue\ndepositary shares representing interests in\nshares of preferred stock, in which case we\nwill send a notice to the depositary between\n40 to 70 days prior to the date fixed for\nredemption. We will mail the notices to the\nholders\u0092 addresses as they appear on our stock\nrecords. Each notice will state:\n                             \n  \u25cf    the redemption date;  \n                             \n                                              \n       the number of shares and the series    \n  \u25cf    of the preferred stock to be           \n       redeemed;                              \n                                              \n                              \n  \u25cf    the redemption price;  \n                              \n                                              \n       the place or places where holders can  \n  \u25cf    surrender the certificates for the     \n       preferred stock for payment of the     \n       redemption price;                      \n                                              \n                                              \n       that dividends on the shares to be     \n  \u25cf    redeemed will cease to accrue on the   \n       redemption date; and                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25cf    the date when the holders\u0092 conversion   \n       rights, if any, will terminate.        \n                                              \nIf we redeem fewer than all shares of any\nseries of the preferred stock held by any\nholder, we will also specify the number of\nshares to be redeemed from the holder in the\nnotice. 63\n\nIf we have given notice of the redemption and\nhave provided the funds for the payment of the\nredemption price, then beginning on the\nredemption date:\n                                              \n       the dividends on the preferred stock   \n  \u25cf    called for redemption will no longer   \n       accrue;                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25cf    those shares will no longer be         \n       considered outstanding; and            \n                                              \n                                              \n       the holders will no longer have any    \n  \u25cf    rights as stockholders except to       \n       receive the redemption price.          \n                                              \nWhen the holder properly surrenders the\nredeemed shares, the redemption price will be\npaid out of the funds provided by us.

Conversion or Exchange The applicable\nprospectus supplement relating to a series of\nconvertible preferred stock will describe the\nterms on which shares of that series are\nconvertible into shares of common stock or a\ndifferent series of preferred stock or\nexchangeable for debt securities. Rights Upon\nLiquidation Unless the applicable prospectus\nsupplement states otherwise, if we voluntarily\nor involuntarily liquidate, dissolve or wind\nup our business, the holders of shares of each\nseries of the preferred stock offered under\nthis prospectus and any preferred stock\nranking equal to the preferred stock offered\nunder this prospectus will be entitled to\nreceive:\n                                              \n       liquidation distributions in the       \n  \u25cf    amount stated in the applicable        \n       prospectus supplement; and             \n                                              \n                                              \n       all accrued and unpaid dividends,      \n  \u25cf    without accumulation of any            \n       undeclared dividends.                  \n                                              \nWe will pay these amounts to the holders of\nshares of each series of the preferred stock,\nand all amounts owing on any preferred stock\nranking equally with such series of preferred\nstock as to distributions upon liquidation,\nout of our assets available for distribution\nto stockholders before any distribution is\nmade to holders of any securities ranking\njunior to the series of preferred stock upon\nliquidation. Shares of our preferred stock may\nbe fully subordinated to interests held by the\nU.S. government in the event of a\nreceivership, insolvency, liquidation or\nsimilar proceeding under the \u0093orderly\nliquidation authority\u0094 of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe sale of all or substantially all of our\nproperty and assets, our merger into or\nconsolidation with any other corporation or\nthe merger of any other corporation into us\nwill not be considered a dissolution,\nliquidation or winding up of our business. We\nwill make pro rata distributions to the\nholders of a series of preferred stock and any\nother shares of our stock ranking equal to\nthat series of preferred stock as to\ndistributions upon dissolution, liquidation or\nwinding up of our business if\n                                              \n       we voluntarily or involuntarily        \n  \u25cf    liquidate, dissolve or wind up our     \n       business, and                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       we do not have enough assets           \n       available for distribution to the      \n       holders of such series of preferred    \n  \u25cf    stock and any                          \n       other shares of our stock ranking      \n       equal with such series as to any such  \n       distribution to pay all amounts to     \n       which the holders are entitled.        \n                                              \n64\n\nThis means the distributions we pay to the\nholders of all shares ranking equal as to\ndistributions upon dissolution, liquidation or\nwinding up of our business will bear the same\nrelationship to each other that the full\ndistributable amounts for which those holders\nare respectively entitled upon dissolution,\nliquidation or winding up of our business bear\nto each other. After we pay the full amount of\nthe liquidation distribution to which the\nholders of a series of the preferred stock are\nentitled, those holders will have no right or\nclaim to any of our remaining assets. Voting\nRights Except as described in this section or\nin the applicable prospectus supplement, or\nexcept as expressly required by applicable\nlaw, the holders of the preferred stock will\nnot be entitled to vote. If the holders of a\nseries of preferred stock are entitled to vote\nand the applicable prospectus supplement does\nnot state otherwise, then each share of\npreferred stock will have one vote; provided,\nhowever, that under no circumstances will the\nholders of preference stock have more than one\nvote per share. As more fully described under\n\u0093Description of Depositary Shares\u0094 below, if\nwe issue depositary shares representing\nfractional interests in a share of preferred\nstock, the holders of each depositary share\nwill be entitled to a fraction of a vote. For\nany series of preferred stock having one vote\nper share, the voting power of the series, on\nmatters on which holders of that series and\nholders of any other series of preferred stock\nare entitled to vote as a single class, will\nsolely depend on the total number of shares in\nthat series and not the aggregate liquidation\npreference or initial offering price. Unless\nthe applicable prospectus supplement states\notherwise, if we have not declared and paid\ndividends on any series of preferred stock\noffered under this prospectus for more than\nsix quarterly periods or their equivalent, the\nholders of that series, together with the\nholders of outstanding shares of all other\nseries of preferred stock ranking equally to\nthat series as to distribution upon\nliquidation and having similar voting rights\nwhich are then exercisable, will be entitled\nto vote for the election of two additional\ndirectors at the next annual meeting of our\nstockholders. If the holders of a series of\npreferred stock are entitled to elect two\nadditional directors, then each share of\npreferred stock will have the number of votes\nspecified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. In such case, the size of our\nboard of directors will increase by two\ndirectors. After we pay the full amount of\ndividends to which the holders of the series\nof preferred stock are entitled, those holders\nwill no longer have a vote for the election of\ntwo additional directors. Unless we receive\nthe consent of the holders of an outstanding\nseries of preferred stock and the outstanding\nshares of all other series of preferred stock\nwhich\n                                              \n       rank equal with that series either as  \n       to dividends or the distribution of    \n  \u25cf    assets upon liquidation, dissolution   \n       or                                     \n       winding up of our business, and        \n                                              \n                                              \n       have voting rights that are            \n  \u25cf    exercisable and that are similar to    \n       those of that series, we will not:     \n                                              \n                                              \n       authorize, create or issue, or         \n       increase the authorized or issued      \n       amount of, any class or series of      \n       stock ranking                          \n  \u25cf    prior to that outstanding preferred    \n       stock with respect to payment of       \n       dividends or the distribution of       \n       assets upon liquidation, dissolution   \n       or winding up of our business; or      \n                                              \n                                              \n       amend, alter or repeal, whether by     \n       merger, consolidation or otherwise,    \n       the provisions of our restated         \n       certificate                            \n       of incorporation, as amended, or of    \n  \u25cf    the resolutions contained in a         \n       certificate of designation creating    \n       that series of the preferred stock in  \n       a way that materially and adversely    \n       affects any right, preference,         \n       privilege or voting power of that      \n       outstanding preferred stock.           \n                                              \n65\n\nThis consent must be given by the holders of\nat least 66 2/ 3% of all outstanding preferred\nstock described in the preceding sentence,\nvoting together as a single class.

If and when issued, our\ndepositary shares will be validly issued,\nfully paid, and non-assessable.The holders of\nthe Series G preferred stock will have no\npreemptive rights with respect to any shares\nof our capital stock or any of our other\nsecurities convertible into or carrying rights\nor options to purchase any such capital stock.\nThe Series G preferred stock will be perpetual\nand will not be convertible into shares of our\ncommon stock or any other class or series of\nour capital stock, and will not be subject to\nany sinking fund or other obligation for their\nrepurchase or retirement. The Series G\npreferred stock would rank senior to our\ncommon stock and to any other securities which\nwe may issue in the future that are\nsubordinate to the Series G preferred stock.\nWe may authorize and issue additional shares\nof preferred stock that may rank junior to, on\nparity with or senior to the Series G\npreferred stock as to dividend rights and\nrights upon liquidation, winding up, or\ndissolution without the consent of the holders\nof the Series G preferred stock. Holders of\nthe Series G preferred stock will be entitled\nto receive, if, when, and as declared by our\nboard of directors out of legally available\nassets, non-cumulativecash dividends at the\nrate of 7.25% per annum of the liquidation\npreference, which will be $15,000.00 per share\nof the Series G preferred stock. Holders of\ndepositary shares will receive one six-\nhundredthof any such dividend and one six-\nhundredthof any such liquidation preference.\nIf authorized and declared, dividends on the\nSeries G preferred stock will be payable 68\n\nquarterly in arrears on March 31, June 30,\nSeptember 30, and December 31 of each year or,\nif any such day is not a business day, on the\nnext business day without interest,\nunless the next business day falls in a\ndifferent calendar year, in which case the\ndividend will be paid on the preceding\nbusiness day. We refer to each such quarter of\na calendar year as a \u0093\u0094. Dividends in each\nquarterly period will accrue from the first\nday of such period. The record date for\npayment of dividends on the Series G preferred\nstock and related depositary shares will be\nthe 15th calendar day of the last calendar\nmonth of the\napplicable dividend period. No interest will\nbe paid on any dividend payment of depositary\nshares representing the Series G preferred\nstock.\n\nThe right of holders of the Series G preferred\nstock to receive dividends will be\nnon-cumulative. If our board of directors does\nnot declare a dividend on the Series G\npreferred stock or declares less than a full\ndividend in respect of any dividend period,\nthe holders of the\nSeries G preferred stock will have no right to\nreceive any dividend or a full dividend, as\nthe case may be, for that dividend period, and\nwe will have no obligation to pay a dividend\nor to pay full dividends for that dividend\nperiod, whether or\nnot dividends are declared and paid for any\nfuture dividend period with respect to the\nSeries G preferred stock or our common stock\nor any other class or series of our preferred\nstock.\n\nUnless full dividend payments on the Series G\npreferred stock have been declared and paid\nfor the immediately preceding dividend period:\nno cash dividend or distribution may be paid\nby us on stock junior to the Series G\npreferred stock, other than distributions or\ndividends payable in such junior stock, no\nsuch junior stock may be redeemed by us for\nany consideration, and no\nmonies shall be paid by us or made available\nfor a sinking fund for the redemption of such\njunior stock.\n\nExcept for certain limited\ncircumstances described below, the Series G\npreferred stock will not be redeemable prior\nto December 31, 2022. On or after such date,\nwe may redeem the Series G preferred stock for\ncash, in whole or in part, at any time and\nfrom time\nto time at its option at the redemption price\nof $15,000.00 per share, plus authorized,\ndeclared and unpaid dividends for the current\ndividend period, if any, to the date of\nredemption. Prior to December 31, 2022, the\nSeries G preferred\nstock may be redeemed in whole, but not in\npart, at the redemption price of $15,000.00\nper share, plus authorized, declared and\nunpaid dividends for the current dividend\nperiod, if any, to the date of redemption, at\nour discretion in the event that\nwe receive a letter or opinion of counsel\nwhich states that there is a significant risk\nthat the Series G preferred stock will no\nlonger constitute Tier 1 capital for purposes\nof the capital adequacy guidelines or policies\nof the Federal\nReserve as a result of any changes in\napplicable laws, related regulations, official\ninterpretations or policies, any official\nadministrative pronouncement or judicial\ndecision interpreting or applying such laws or\nregulations. For redemptions after\nDecember 31, 2022, if our board of directors\ndetermines that we should redeem fewer than\nall of the outstanding Series G preferred\nstock, the securities to be redeemed will be\ndetermined by lot, pro rata, or by such other\nmethod as our\nboard of directors in its sole discretion\ndetermines to be equitable.\n\nDividends will cease to accrue on the Series G\npreferred\nstock called for redemption on and as of the\ndate fixed for redemption and such Series G\npreferred stock will be deemed to cease to be\noutstanding, provided, that the redemption\nprice, including any authorized and declared\nbut unpaid dividends\nfor the current dividend period, if any, to\nthe date fixed for redemption, has been duly\npaid or provision has been made for such\npayment. Notice of any redemption will be\nmailed at least 30 days, but not more than 60\ndays, prior to any\nredemption date to each holder of the Series G\npreferred stock to be redeemed at such\nholder\u0092s registered address.\n\nIn the\nevent we voluntarily or involuntarily\nliquidate, dissolve, or wind up, the holders\nof the Series G preferred stock at the time\noutstanding will be entitled to receive\nliquidating distributions in the amount of\n$15,000.00 per share, or $25.00\nper depositary share representing a one-six\nhundredth interest in the Series G preferred\nstock, plus any authorized, declared, and\nunpaid dividends for the then-current dividend\nperiod to the date of\nliquidation, out of our assets legally\navailable for distribution to our\nshareholders, before any distribution of\nassets is made to holders of our common stock\nor any securities ranking junior to the Series\nG preferred stock and subject to the\nrights of the holders of any class or series\nof securities ranking senior to or on a parity\nwith the Series G preferred stock upon\nliquidation and the rights of our depositors\nand our series of securities ranking\n\n69\n\nsenior to or on a parity with the Series G\npreferred stock upon liquidation and the\nrights of our depositors and creditors. After\npayment of the full amount of the liquidating\ndistributions\nto which they are entitled, the holders of the\nSeries G preferred stock will have no right or\nclaim to any of our remaining assets. In the\nevent that, upon any such voluntary or\ninvoluntary liquidation, dissolution, or\nwinding up, our available\nassets are insufficient to pay the amount of\nthe liquidation distributions on all\noutstanding shares of Series G preferred stock\nand the corresponding amounts payable on any\nother securities of equal ranking, then the\nholders of the\nSeries G preferred stock and any other\nsecurities of equal ranking will share ratably\nin any such distribution of assets in\nproportion to the full liquidating\ndistributions to which they would otherwise be\nrespectively entitled.\n\nFor such purposes, our consolidation or merger\nwith or into any other entity, the\nconsolidation or merger of any other entity\nwith or into\nus, or the sale of all or substantially all of\nour property or business, will not be deemed\nto constitute our liquidation, dissolution, or\nwinding up.\n\nHolders of our Series G preferred stock will\nnot have any voting rights, except as required\nby law, and will not be entitled to elect\nany directors.\n\nSeriesG Depositary Shares. Each Series G\ndepositary share issued by\nus, which we refer to as our \u0093,\u0094 will\nrepresent a one six-hundredth interest in one\nshare of our Series G preferred stock. The\nSeries G\ndepositary shares will be evidenced by\ndepositary receipts. The shares of our Series\nG preferred stock underlying the depositary\nshares will, upon issuance, be deposited with\nEquiniti Trust Company, as depositary, under a\ndeposit agreement\nbetween us, the depositary and all holders\nfrom time to time of depositary receipts\nissued by the depositary thereunder. We do not\nintend to list or quote the Series G\ndepositary shares or the Series G preferred\nstock on any national securities\nexchange or national quotation system.\nAccordingly, there will be no public trading\nmarket for the depositary shares or the Series\nG preferred stock.\n\nSubject to the terms of the deposit agreement,\neach owner of the Series G depositary shares\nwill be entitled, through the depositary, to\nall\nthe rights, preferences and privileges of a\nfractional share of the Series G preferred\nstock.\n\nThe depositary will act as transfer\nagent and registrar and paying agent with\nrespect to the Series G depositary shares.\n\nThe depositary\u0092s office at which the\ndepositary receipts will be administered is\nlocated at Equiniti Trust Company, 1110 Centre\nPointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota Heights, MN\n55120.\n\nThe Series G depositary shares may be held\neither directly or indirectly through a broker\nor other financial institution. If the Series\nG\ndepositary shares are held directly, by having\nsuch Series G depositary shares registered in\nsuch holder\u0092s name on the books of the\ndepositary, such holder will be a depositary\nreceipt holder. If the Series G depositary\nshares are held\nthrough a broker or financial institution\nnominee, the beneficial holder must rely on\nthe procedures of such broker or financial\ninstitution to assert the rights of a\ndepositary receipt holder described in this\nsection.\n\nThe depositary will distribute all cash\ndividends, dividends paid in Series G\ndepositary shares representing fully paid and\nnon-assessable shares of our Series G\npreferred stock or other cash distributions\nreceived in respect of the Series G preferred\nstock to the record holders of the Series G\ndepositary shares representing\nsuch Series G preferred stock in proportion to\nthe number of such Series G depositary shares\nowned by such holders on the relevant record\ndate. In the event of a distribution other\nthan in cash, the depositary will distribute\nproperty received\nby it to the record holders of the Series G\ndepositary shares entitled thereto, unless the\ndepositary determines that it is not feasible\nto make such distribution, in which case the\ndepositary may, after consultation with us,\nsell such property and\ndistribute the net proceeds from such sale to\nsuch holders.\n\nIf the Series G preferred stock underlying the\ndepositary shares are\nredeemed, the Series G depositary shares will\nbe redeemed with the proceeds received by the\ndepositary resulting from the redemption,\n\n70\n\nin whole or in part, of such Series G\npreferred stock held by the depositary. The\nredemption price per Series G depositary share\nwill be equal to the applicable fraction of\nthe redemption\nprice per share payable with respect to such\nSeries G preferred stock. If less than all the\nSeries G depositary shares are to be redeemed,\nthe Series G depositary shares to be redeemed\nwill be selected by lot or pro rata, in our\nsole\ndiscretion.\n\nAfter the date fixed for redemption (which\nwill be the same date as the redemption date,\nif any, for the Series G\npreferred stock), the Series G depositary\nshares so called for redemption will no longer\nbe deemed to be outstanding and all rights of\nthe holders of the Series G depositary shares\nwill cease, except the right to receive the\nmoney payable upon such\nredemption and any money or other property to\nwhich the holders of such Series G depositary\nshares were entitled upon such redemption upon\nsurrender to the depositary of the depositary\nreceipts evidencing such Series G depositary\nshares.\n\nSeries L Preferred Stock. Our Series L\npreferred ranks senior to our common stock and\nto any other securities that we may\nissue in the future that are subordinate to\nthe Series L preferred stock.\n\nDividends on shares of our Series L preferred\nstock\nare not cumulative. Holders of the Series L\npreferred stock are entitled to receive, if,\nas and when declared by our board of directors\nout of legally available assets, non-\ncumulative cash dividends on\nthe Liquidation Preference, which is $1,000\nper share of our Series L preferred stock.\nThese dividends are payable at a rate per\nannum equal to 7.50%, quarterly in arrears on\neach March 15, June 15, September 15 and\nDecember 15, each a \u0093\u0094, from and including the\ndate of issuance. The right of holders of our\nSeries L preferred stock to receive dividends\nis non-cumulative.\n\nWhen dividends are not paid in full upon the\nSeries L preferred stock and any parity stock,\nall dividends upon shares of the\nSeries L preferred stock and such parity stock\nwill be declared on a proportional basis,\nbased upon the ratio of the amount of\ndividends declared on each series to the\namount that if declared would be full\ndividends (including accrued and\nunpaid dividends as to any parity stock that\nbears dividends on a cumulative basis) through\nthe next succeeding applicable dividend\npayment date.\n\nOur Series L preferred stock is not redeemable\nand is not subject to any sinking fund or\nother obligation to redeem, repurchase or\nretire the Series L preferred stock.\n\nEach share of our Series L preferred stock may\nbe converted at any time, at the option of\nthe holder, into 6.3814 shares of our common\nstock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares,\nsubject to anti-dilution adjustments (such\nrate or adjusted rate, the \u0093\u0094).\n\nOn or after March 15, 2013, we may, at our\noption, at any time or from time to time cause\nsome or all of the Series L preferred\nstock to be converted into shares of our\ncommon stock at the then applicable conversion\nrate if, for 20 trading days within any period\nof 30 consecutive trading days, including the\nlast trading day of such period, the closing\nprice of our common\nstock exceeds 130% of the then applicable\nconversion price of the Series L preferred\nstock. We will provide notice of our decision\nto exercise our right to cause the mandatory\nconversion within three trading days of the\nend of the 30\nconsecutive trading day period. The applicable\nconversion price at any given time will be\ncomputed by dividing $1,000 by the applicable\nconversion rate at such time.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, no holder of\nour Series L preferred stock will be entitled\nto receive shares of our common stock upon\nconversion to the extent (but only to the\nextent) that such receipt would cause such\nconverting holder to become, directly or\nindirectly, a \u0093beneficial owner\u0094 (within the\nmeaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act\nand the rules and\nregulations promulgated thereunder) of more\nthan 9.9% of the shares of our common stock\noutstanding at such time. Any purported\ndelivery of shares of our common stock upon\nconversion of the Series L preferred stock\nshall be void and have no\neffect to the extent, but only to the extent,\nthat such delivery would result in the\nconverting holder becoming the beneficial\nowner of more than 9.9% of the shares of our\ncommon stock outstanding at such time. If any\ndelivery of shares of our\ncommon stock owed\n\n71\n\nto a holder upon conversion of the Series L\npreferred stock is not made, in whole or in\npart, as a result of this limitation, our\nobligation to make such delivery shall not be\nextinguished and we shall deliver such shares\nas promptly as practicable after any such\nconverting holder gives notice to us that such\ndelivery would not result in it being the\nbeneficial owner of more than 9.9% of the\nshares of our common stock outstanding at such\ntime. This limitation on beneficial ownership\nshall not constrain in any event our ability\nto exercise our right to cause the Series L\npreferred stock to convert mandatorily. The\nfollowing provisions will apply if, prior to\nthe conversion date, one of the following\nevents occur prior to the conversion date for\nshares of our Series L preferred stock:\n                                              \n       a \u0093person\u0094 or \u0093group\u0094 within the meaning   \n       of Section\u00a013(d) of the Exchange Act   \n       files a                                \n       Schedule TO or any schedule, form or   \n       report under the Exchange Act          \n       disclosing that such person or group   \n  \u25cf    has become the direct or indirect      \n       ultimate \u0093beneficial owner,\u0094 as defined  \n       in Rule 13d-3 under                    \n       the Exchange Act, of our common        \n       equity representing more than 50% of   \n       the voting power of our common stock;  \n       or                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       consummation of any consolidation or   \n       merger or similar transaction or any   \n       sale, lease or other transfer in one   \n       transaction or a series of             \n       transactions of all or substantially   \n       all of the consolidated assets of us   \n       and our subsidiaries, taken as a       \n       whole, to any person other than one    \n       of our subsidiaries, in each case      \n       pursuant to which our shares of        \n       common stock                           \n       will be converted into cash,           \n       securities or other property, other    \n  \u25cf    than pursuant to a transaction in      \n       which the persons that \u0093beneficially    \n       owned\u0094 (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under  \n       the Exchange Act),                     \n       directly or indirectly, voting shares  \n       immediately prior to such transaction  \n       beneficially own, directly or          \n       indirectly, voting shares              \n       representing a majority of the total   \n       voting power of all outstanding        \n       classes of voting shares of the        \n       continuing or                          \n       surviving person immediately after     \n       the transaction.                       \n                                              \nThese transactions are referred to as \u0093make-\nwhole acquisitions.\u0094 However, a make-whole\nacquisition will not be deemed to have\noccurred if at least 90% of the consideration\n(as determined by our board of directors)\nreceived by holders of our common stock in the\ntransaction or transactions consists of shares\nof common stock or American depositary\nreceipts in respect of common stock that are\ntraded on a U.S. national securities exchange\nor a securities exchange in the European\nEconomic Area or that will be traded on a U.S.\nnational securities exchange or on securities\nexchanges in the European Economic Area when\nissued or exchanged in connection with a make-\nwhole acquisition. The phrase \u0093all or\nsubstantially all\u0094 of our assets is likely to\nbe interpreted by reference to applicable\nstate law at the relevant time, and will be\ndependent on the facts and circumstances\nexisting at such time. As a result, there may\nbe a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining\nwhether a sale or transfer is of \u0093all or\nsubstantially all\u0094 of our assets. Upon a make-\nwhole acquisition, we will, under certain\ncircumstances, increase the conversion rate in\nrespect of any conversions of the Series L\npreferred stock that occur during the period\n(make-whole acquisition conversion period)\nbeginning on the effective date of the make-\nwhole acquisition (effective date) and ending\non the date that is 30 days after the\neffective date, by a number of additional\nshares of our common stock (make-whole shares)\nas described below. We will notify holders, at\nleast 20 days prior to the anticipated\neffective date of such make-whole acquisition,\nor within two business days of becoming aware\nof a make-whole acquisition described in the\nfirst bullet of the definition of \u0093make-whole\nacquisition,\u0094 of the anticipated effective\ndate of such transaction. The notice will\nspecify the anticipated effective date of the\nmake-whole acquisition and the date by which\neach holder\u0092s make-whole acquisition\nconversion right must be exercised, which\nshall be 30 days after the effective date of\nthe make-whole acquisition. We will also\nnotify holders on the effective date of such\nmake-whole 72\n\nacquisition, or as soon as practicable\nthereafter, specifying, among other things,\nthe date that is 30 days after the effective\ndate, the number of make-whole shares and the\namount of the cash, securities and other\nconsideration receivable by the holder upon\nconversion. To exercise the make-whole\nacquisition conversion right, a holder must\ndeliver to the conversion agent, on or before\nthe close of business on the date specified in\nthe notice, the certificate evidencing such\nholder\u0092s shares of the Series L preferred\nstock, if the Series L preferred stock is held\nin certificated form. If a holder\u0092s interest\nis a beneficial interest in a global\ncertificate representing our Series L\npreferred stock, in order to convert a holder\nmust comply with certain conversion procedures\nand comply with the depositary\u0092s procedures\nfor converting a beneficial interest in a\nglobal security. The date that the holder\ncomplies with these requirements is referred\nto as the \u0093make-whole conversion date\u0094. If a\nholder does not elect to exercise the make-\nwhole acquisition conversion right within the\nspecified period, such holder\u0092s shares of the\nSeries L preferred stock will remain\noutstanding until otherwise converted but will\nnot be eligible to receive make-whole shares.\nThe following table sets forth the number of\nmake-whole shares per share of our Series L\npreferred stock for each stock price and\neffective date set forth below:\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nThe number of make-whole shares will be\ndetermined by reference to the table above and\nis based on the effective date and the price\n(\u0093 stock price\u0094) paid per share of our common\nstock in such transaction. If the holders our\nof common stock receive only cash (in a single\nper-shareamount, other than with respect to\nappraisal and similar rights) in the make-\nwhole acquisition, the stock price shall be\nthe cash amount paid per share. For purposes\nof the preceding sentence as applied to a\nmake-whole acquisition described in the first\nbullet of the definition of that term, a\nsingle price per share shall be deemed to have\nbeen paid only if the transaction or\ntransactions that caused the person or group\nto become direct or indirect ultimate\nbeneficial owners of our common equity\nrepresenting more than 50% of the voting power\nof our common stock was a tender offer for\nmore than 50% of our outstanding common stock.\nOtherwise, the stock price shall be the\naverage of the closing price per share of our\ncommon stock on the 10 trading days up to but\nnot including the effective date. The stock\nprices set forth in the first row of the table\n(the column headers) will be adjusted as of\nany date on which the conversion rate of the\nSeries L preferred stock is adjusted. The\nadjusted stock prices will equal the stock\nprices applicable immediately prior to such\nadjustment multiplied by a fraction, the\nnumerator of which is the conversion rate\nimmediately prior to the adjustment giving\nrise to the stock price adjustment and the\ndenominator of which is the conversion rate as\nso adjusted. Each of the number of make-whole\nshares in the table will be subject to\nadjustment in the same manner as the\nconversion rate as set forth below in our\ndescription of anti-dilution rate adjustments.\nIn lieu of receiving the make-whole shares, if\nthe reference price (as defined below) in\nconnection with a make-whole acquisition is\nless than $120.54 (a fundamental change), a\nholder may elect to convert each share of our\nSeries L preferred stock during the period\nbeginning on the effective date of the\nfundamental change and ending on the date that\nis 30 days after the effective date of the\nfundamental change at an adjusted conversion\nprice equal to the greater of (1) the\nreference price and (2) $60.27 (base price).\nThe base price will be adjusted as of any date\nthat the conversion rate of the Series L\npreferred stock is adjusted. The adjusted base\nprice will equal the base price applicable\nimmediately prior to such adjustment\nmultiplied by a fraction, the 73\n\nnumerator of which is the conversion rate\nimmediately prior to the adjustment giving\nrise to the conversion rate adjustment and the\ndenominator of which is the conversion rate as\nso adjusted. If\nthe reference price is less than the base\nprice, holders will receive a maximum of\n16.5916 shares of our common stock per share\nof our Series L preferred stock, subject to\nadjustment, which may result in a holder\nreceiving value that is\nless than the liquidation preference of the\nSeries L preferred stock. In lieu of issuing\nour common stock upon conversion in the event\nof a fundamental change, we may at our option,\nand if we obtain any necessary regulatory\napproval, make a\ncash payment equal to the reference price for\neach share of our common stock otherwise\nissuable upon conversion. The \u0093reference\nprice\u0094 is the \u0093stock price\u0094 as defined above.\n\nTo exercise the fundamental change conversion\nright, a holder must comply with certain\nconversion procedures on or before the date\nthat is\n30 days following the effectiveness of the\nfundamental change and indicate that it is\nexercising the fundamental change conversion\nright. If a holder does not elect to exercise\nthe fundamental change conversion right, such\nholder will not be\neligible to convert such holder\u0092s shares at\nthe base price and such holder\u0092s shares of the\nSeries L preferred stock will remain\noutstanding until otherwise converted.\n\nWe will notify holders, at least 20 days prior\nto the anticipated effective date of a\nfundamental change, or within two business\ndays of\nbecoming aware of a make-whole acquisition\ndescribed in the first bullet of the\ndefinition of \u0093make-whole acquisition,\u0094 of the\nanticipated effective date of such\ntransaction. The notice will specify the\nanticipated effective date of the\nfundamental change and the date by which each\nholder\u0092s fundamental change conversion right\nmust be exercised. We will also provide notice\nto holders on the effective date of a\nfundamental change, or as soon as practicable\nthereafter,\nspecifying, among other things, the date that\nis 30 days after the effective date, the\nadjusted conversion price following the\nfundamental change and the amount of the cash,\nsecurities and other consideration receivable\nby the holder upon\nconversion. To exercise the fundamental change\nconversion right, a holder must comply with\ncertain conversion procedures on or before the\ndate that is 30 days following the\neffectiveness of the fundamental change and\nindicate that it is\nexercising the fundamental change conversion\nright. If a holder does not elect to exercise\nthe fundamental change conversion right within\nsuch period, such holder will not be eligible\nto convert such holder\u0092s shares at the base\nprice and such\nholder\u0092s shares of Series L preferred stock\nwill remain outstanding (subject to the holder\nelecting to convert such holder\u0092s shares).\n\nIn the event of:\n\n(1) our\nconsolidation or merger with or into another\nperson in each case pursuant to which our\ncommon stock will be converted into cash,\nsecurities or other of our property or another\nperson;\n\n(2) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to\nanother person of all or substantially all of\nthe consolidated assets of us and our\nsubsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case\npursuant to which our common stock will be\nconverted into cash, securities or other\nproperty;\n\n(3) any reclassification of our common stock\ninto securities, including securities other\nthan our common stock; or\n\n(4) any statutory exchange of our securities\nwith another person (other than in connection\nwith a merger or acquisition)\n\neach of which is referred to as a \u0093,\u0094 each\nshare of our Series L preferred stock\noutstanding immediately prior to\nsuch reorganization event will, without the\nconsent of the holders of the Series L\npreferred stock, become convertible into the\ntypes and amounts of securities, cash and\nother property receivable in such\nreorganization event by a holder of the\nshares of our common stock that was not the\ncounterparty to the reorganization event or an\naffiliate of such other party (such\nsecurities, cash and other property, the \u0093\u0094).\nIn the event that holders of our common\nstock have the opportunity to elect the form\nof consideration\n\n74\n\nto be received in such transaction, the\nconsideration that the holders of the Series L\npreferred stock entitled to receive will be\ndeemed to be the types and amounts of\nconsideration received by the majority of the\nholders of the shares of our common stock that\naffirmatively make an election. Holders have\nthe right to convert their shares of our\nSeries L preferred stock in the event of\ncertain acquisitions. In connection with\ncertain reorganization events, holders of the\nSeries L preferred stock may have the right to\nvote as a class. The conversion rate will be\nadjusted, without duplication, if certain\nevents occur: (1) the issuance of our common\nstock as a dividend or distribution to all\nholders of our common stock, or a subdivision\nor combination of our common stock (other than\nin connection with a transaction constituting\na reorganization event), in which event the\nconversion rate will be adjusted based on

In the event of our voluntary or\ninvoluntary dissolution, winding up and\nliquidation, the holders of the Series L\npreferred stock are entitled to receive a\nliquidating distribution in the amount of the\nliquidation preference of $1,000 per share,\nplus any authorized, declared and unpaid\ndividends for the then-current dividend period\nto the date of liquidation, out of our assets\nlegally available for distribution to our\nstockholders, before any distribution is made\nto holders of our common stock or any\nsecurities ranking junior to the Series L\npreferred stock and subject to the rights of\nthe holders of any class or series of\nsecurities ranking senior to or on parity with\nthe Series L preferred stock upon liquidation\nand the rights of our creditors. If the\namounts available for distribution upon our\ndissolution, winding up and liquidation are\nnot sufficient to satisfy the full liquidation\nrights of all the outstanding Series L\npreferred stock and all stock ranking equal to\nthe Series L preferred stock, then the holders\nof each series of our Series L preferred stock\nwill share ratably in any distribution of\nassets in proportion to the full respective\npreferential amount to which they are\nentitled.

Holders of our\nSeries L preferred stock do not have any\nvoting rights and are not entitled to elect\nany directors, except as required by law and\nexcept for the special voting rights provided\nfor below. If we fail to pay, or declare and\nset aside for payment, full dividends on the\nSeries L preferred stock or any other class or\nseries of voting parity stock for six dividend\nperiods or their equivalent (whether or not\nconsecutive), the authorized number of\ndirectors serving on our board of directors\nwill be increased by two.

When\ndividends have been paid in full on the Series\nL preferred stock and any and all voting\nparity stock for at least four consecutive\ndividend periods or their equivalent, then the\nright of the holders of our Series L preferred\nstock to elect directors shall cease (but\nsubject always to revesting of such voting\nrights in the case of any future nonpayment of\ndividends), and, if and when all rights of\nholders of our Series L preferred stock and\nvoting parity stock to elect directors shall\nhave ceased, the terms of office of all the\ndirectors elected by preferred stock holders\nunder this provision shall forthwith terminate\nand the number of directors constituting the\nboard of directors shall automatically be\nreduced accordingly. 78\n\nSo long as any shares of our Series L\npreferred stock are outstanding, the vote or\nconsent of the holders of at least 66 2/ 3% of\nthe shares of our Series L preferred stock at\nthe time outstanding, voting as a class with\nall other series of preferred stock ranking\nequally with the Series L preferred stock and\nentitled to vote thereon, given in person or\nby proxy, either in writing without a meeting\nor by vote at any meeting called for the\npurpose, will be necessary for effecting or\nvalidating any of the following actions,\nwhether or not such approval is required by\nDelaware law:\n                                              \n       any amendment, alteration or repeal    \n       of any provision of our restated       \n       certificate of incorporation, as       \n       amended                                \n       (including the certificates of         \n  \u25cf    designations creating the Series\u00a0L     \n       preferred stock) or our by-laws that   \n       would alter or change the voting       \n       powers, preferences or special rights  \n       of the holders of the Series L         \n       preferred stock so as to affect them   \n       adversely;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       any amendment or alteration of our     \n       restated certificate of                \n       incorporation, as amended, to          \n       authorize or create, or                \n       increase the authorized amount of, or  \n       any issuance of any shares of, or any  \n  \u25cf    securities convertible into shares     \n       of, any class or series of our         \n       capital stock ranking prior to the     \n       Series L preferred stock in the        \n       payment of dividends or in the         \n       distribution of assets on our          \n       liquidation, dissolution or winding    \n       up; or                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       the consummation of a binding share    \n       exchange or reclassification           \n       involving the Series L preferred       \n       stock or a                             \n       merger or consolidation with another   \n       entity, except holders of our Series   \n       L preferred stock will have no right   \n       to vote under this provision or        \n       otherwise under Delaware law if, in    \n       each case, (i)\u00a0the Series L preferred  \n       stock remains outstanding              \n       or, in the case of any such merger or  \n       consolidation with respect to which    \n       we are not the surviving or resulting  \n  \u25cf    entity, is converted into or           \n       exchanged for preference securities    \n       of the surviving or resulting entity   \n       or its ultimate parent, and            \n       (ii)\u00a0such Series L preferred stock     \n       remaining outstanding or such          \n       preference securities, as the case     \n       may be, has such rights, preferences,  \n       privileges and voting powers, taken    \n       as a whole, as are not materially      \n       less favorable to the holders          \n       thereof than the rights, preferences,  \n       privileges and voting powers of the    \n       Series L preferred stock, taken as a   \n       whole;                                 \n                                              \nexcept that any authorization, creation or\nincrease in the authorized amount of or\nissuance of our Series L preferred stock or\nany class or series of parity stock or junior\nstock or any securities convertible into any\nclass or series of parity stock (whether\ndividends payable in respect of such parity\nstock are cumulative or non-cumulative)or\njunior stock will be deemed not to adversely\naffect the rights, preferences, privileges or\nvoting powers of the holders of the Series L\npreferred stock, and, notwithstanding any\nprovision of Delaware law, holders of the\nSeries L preferred stock shall have no right\nto vote thereon. Series Q Preferred Stock.Our\n5.85% Fixed-to-FloatingRate Non-\nCumulativePerpetual Class A Preferred Stock,\nSeries Q, which we refer to as our \u0093 Series Q\npreferred stock,\u0094 with no par value, ranks\nsenior to our common stock and to any other\nsecurities that we may issue in the future\nthat are expressly made junior to our Series Q\npreferred stock, as to payment of dividends\nand/or distribution of assets upon our\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up. The\nSeries Q preferred stock ranks equally with\nour Parity Stock (as such term is defined in\nthe certificate of designation for the Series\nQ preferred stock) as to payment of dividends\nand distribution of assets upon our\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up.\nDividends on shares of our Series Q preferred\nstock are not mandatory.

These dividends are payable\nquarterly in arrears on each March 15, June\n15, September 15 and December 15. The right\nof holders of our Series Q preferred stock to\nreceive dividends is non-cumulative. The\nSeries Q preferred stock was issued on July\n22, 2013, and the first dividend payment date\nwas\nSeptember 15, 2013.\n\nTo the extent we declare dividends on the\nSeries Q preferred stock and on any other\nParity Stock but\ncannot make full payment of those declared\ndividends, we will allocate the dividend\npayments on a proportional basis among the\nholders of shares of Series Q preferred stock\nand the holders of any Parity Stock then\noutstanding where the terms of\nsuch Parity Stock provide similar dividend\nrights. No interest will be payable in respect\nof any dividend payment that may be in\narrears.\n\nWe cannot pay dividends on our common stock or\nother securities ranking junior to the Series\nQ preferred stock or repurchase, redeem or\notherwise acquire for consideration shares of\nour common stock, other securities ranking\njunior to the Series Q preferred stock or\nParity Stock, subject to certain exceptions,\nunless the full dividends for the then-current\nperiod on all\noutstanding shares of Series Q preferred stock\nhave been declared and paid or declared and a\nsum sufficient for the payment of those\ndividends has been set aside.\n\nWe, at the option of our board of directors or\nany duly authorized committee of our board of\ndirectors, may redeem, subject to the prior\napproval of the FRB, the Series Q preferred\nstock, in whole or in part, on any dividend\npayment date on or after September 15, 2023.\nIn addition, within 90 days of our good faith\ndetermination that a Regulatory Capital\nTreatment Event (as\nsuch term is defined in the certificate of\ndesignation for the Series Q preferred stock),\nwe, at the option of our board of directors or\nany duly authorized committee of the board of\ndirectors, may, subject to approval of the\nappropriate\nfederal banking agency, redeem in whole, but\nnot in part, the shares of Series Q preferred\nstock at the time outstanding prior to\nSeptember 15, 2023.

Upon the vesting of such right of such\nholders, the maximum authorized number of\nmembers of our board of directors shall\nautomatically be increased by two and the two\nvacancies so created shall be\nfilled by vote of the holders of the\noutstanding Series Q preferred stock (together\nwith the holders of shares of any one or more\nother series of Voting Parity Stock). At\nelections for such directors, each holder of\nSeries Q preferred\nstock shall be entitled to 25 votes for each\nshare held (the holders of shares of any other\nseries of\n\n80\n\nVoting Parity Stock being entitled to such\nnumber of votes, if any, for each share of\nsuch stock as may be granted to them). The\nright of the holders of the Series Q preferred\nstock (voting together as a class with the\nholders of shares of any one or more other\nseries of Voting Parity Stock) to elect such\ndirectors shall continue until such time as we\nhave paid in full dividends for the equivalent\nof at least four quarterly dividend periods or\ntheir equivalent, at which time such right\nwith respect to the Series Q preferred stock\nshall terminate, except as provided by law,\nand subject to revesting in the event of each\nand every subsequent nonpayment of dividends.\nUpon any termination of the right of the\nholders of all shares of Series Q preferred\nstock and Voting Parity Stock to vote for\ndirectors, the term of office of all such\ndirectors then in office elected by only those\nholders voting as a class shall terminate\nimmediately. Whenever the term of office of\nthe directors elected by such holders voting\nas a class shall end and the special voting\npowers vested in such holders shall have\nexpired, the number of directors shall be such\nnumber as may be provided for in our by-laws.\nIn addition to any other vote required by law\nor our restated certificate of incorporation,\nas amended, so long as any shares of our\nSeries Q preferred stock are outstanding, the\nvote or consent of the holders of the\noutstanding shares of our Series Q preferred\nstock and outstanding shares of all other\nseries of Voting Parity Stock entitled to vote\non the matter, by a vote of at least 66 2/ 3%\nin voting power of all such outstanding Series\nQ preferred stock and such Voting Parity\nStock, voting together as a class, given in\nperson or by proxy, either in writing without\na meeting or at any meeting called for the\npurpose, will be necessary to permit, effect\nor validate any one or more of the following\nactions, whether or not such approval is\nrequired by Delaware law:\n                                              \n       the issuance of any series of          \n       preferred stock or preference stock    \n       ranking senior to the Series Q         \n       preferred stock                        \n  \u25cf    with respect to either the payment of  \n       dividends or the distribution of       \n       assets in the event of any voluntary   \n       or involuntary liquidation,            \n       dissolution or winding up;

Each Series Q\ndepositary share issued by us represents a\n1/1,000th interest in one share of our Series\nQ preferred stock. The shares of our Series Q\npreferred stock are deposited with Equiniti\nTrust Company, as\ndepositary. Pursuant to the deposit agreement,\nthe depositary issued Series Q depositary\nshares, which are evidenced by depositary\nreceipts.\n\nEquiniti Trust Company acts as transfer agent\nand registrar and paying agent with respect to\nthe Series Q depositary shares.\n\nThe depositary\u0092s office at which the\ndepositary receipts are administered is\nlocated at Equiniti Trust Company, 1110 Centre\nPointe\nCurve, Suite 101, Mendota Heights, MN 55120.\n\nThe Series Q depositary shares were issued in\nbook-entry form through DTC. This means\nthat actual depositary receipts will not be\nissued, except in limited circumstances. This\nmeans that the Series Q depositary shares will\nbe in the form of a single global depositary\nreceipt deposited with a DTC nominee. Each\nbeneficial holder\nmust rely on the procedures of DTC and if the\nSeries Q depositary shares are held through a\nbroker or financial institution nominee, the\nbeneficial holder must rely on the procedures\nof such broker or financial institution to\nassert the rights\nof a depositary receipt holder described in\nthis section.\n\nThe depositary will distribute all cash\ndividends or other cash distributions\nreceived on the Series Q preferred stock to\nthe holders of record of Series Q depositary\nshares in proportion to the numbers of such\ndepositary shares owned by each holder. In the\nevent of a distribution other than in cash,\nthe depositary\nwill distribute property received by it to the\nholders of record of the Series Q depositary\nshares in proportion to the number of Series Q\ndepositary shares held by each holder, unless\nthe depositary determines that it is not\nfeasible to\nmake such distribution, in which case the\ndepositary may, with our approval, adopt a\nmethod of distribution that it deems\npracticable, including the sale of such\nproperty and distribution of the net proceeds\nfrom such sale to such holders.\n\nRecord dates for the payment of dividends and\nother matters relating to the Series Q\ndepositary shares are the same as the\ncorresponding\nrecord dates for the Series Q preferred stock.\n\nThe amounts distributed to holders of the\nSeries Q depositary shares will be\nreduced by any amounts required to be withheld\nby the depositary or by us on account of taxes\nor other governmental charges.\n\nIf the\nSeries Q preferred stock underlying the Series\nQ depositary shares is redeemed (i) after\nSeptember 15, 2023, in whole or in part, or\n(ii) prior to September 15, 2023 in whole, but\nnot in part, due to the occurrence of a\nRegulatory Capital Treatment Event, Series Q\ndepositary shares will be redeemed with the\nproceeds received by the depositary from the\nredemption of the Series Q preferred stock\nheld by the depositary.\n\n82\n\nThe redemption price per Series Q depositary\nshare will be equal to 1/1,000th of the\napplicable redemption price per share payable\nwith respect to such Series Q preferred stock\n(or\n$25 per Series Q depositary share), plus an\namount equal to any declared and unpaid\ndividends, without accumulation of any\nundeclared dividends. If less than all the\nSeries Q preferred stock is redeemed after\nSeptember 15, 2023, the\nSeries Q depositary shares to be redeemed will\nbe selected pro rata, or in any other manner\ndetermined by the depositary to be fair and\nequitable.\n\nWhen the depositary receives notice of any\nmeeting at which the holders of the Series Q\npreferred stock are entitled to vote, the\ndepositary will mail, or otherwise transmit by\nan authorized method, the information\ncontained in the notice and any accompanying\nproxy material to the record holders of the\nSeries Q depositary shares relating to the\nSeries Q preferred\nstock. Each record holder of the Series Q\ndepositary shares on the record date, which\nwill be the same date as the record date for\nthe Series Q preferred stock, may instruct the\ndepositary to vote the amount of the Series Q\npreferred\nstock represented by the holder\u0092s Series Q\ndepositary shares. To the extent possible, the\ndepositary will vote the amount of the Series\nQ preferred stock represented by the Series Q\ndepositary shares in accordance with the\ninstructions it receives. We will agree to\ntake all reasonable actions that the\ndepositary determines are necessary to enable\nthe depositary to vote as instructed. If the\ndepositary does not receive specific\ninstructions from the holders of any\nSeries Q depositary shares representing the\nSeries Q preferred stock, it will not vote the\namount of Series Q preferred stock represented\nby such Series Q depositary shares.\n\nSeriesR Preferred Stock.Our 6.625% Fixed-to-\nFloating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Class A\nPreferred Stock, Series R, which we refer to\nas our \u0093,\u0094 with no par value, ranks senior to\nour common stock and to any other securities\nthat we may issue in the future that are\nexpressly made junior to our Series R\npreferred stock, as to payment of dividends\nand/or distribution of\nassets upon our liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding up. The Series R preferred stock ranks\nequally with our Parity Stock (as such term is\ndefined in the certificate of designation for\nthe Series R preferred stock) as to payment of\ndividends and distribution of assets upon our\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up.\n\nDividends on shares of our Series R preferred\nstock are not mandatory. Holders of our Series\nR preferred stock are entitled to receive,\nwhen, as and if declared by our board of\ndirectors or any duly authorized committee of\nour board of directors out of legally\navailable assets, non-cumulative cash\ndividends on the liquidation preference\namount, which is $25,000 per share of Series R\npreferred stock. From December 18, 2013 to,\nbut excluding, March 15, 2024 (the \u0093\u0094), these\ndividends will accrue at a fixed rate per\nannum equal to 6.625%, and from, and\nincluding, March 15, 2024 (the \u0093\u0094), dividends\nwill accrue at a rate per annum equal to\nthree-month\nLIBOR plus 3.69%. These dividends are payable\nquarterly in arrears on each March 15, June\n15, September 15 and December 15. The right of\nholders of our Series R preferred stock to\nreceive dividends is non-cumulative. The\nSeries R preferred stock was issued on\nDecember 18, 2013, and the first dividend\npayment date was March 15, 2014.\n\nTo the extent we declare dividends on the\nSeries R preferred stock and on any other\nParity Stock but cannot make full payment of\nthose\ndeclared dividends, we will allocate the\ndividend payments on a proportional basis\namong the holders of shares of Series R\npreferred stock and the holders of any Parity\nStock then outstanding where the terms of such\nParity Stock provide similar\ndividend rights. No interest will be payable\nin respect of any dividend payment that may be\nin arrears.\n\nWe cannot pay dividends on our\ncommon stock or other securities ranking\njunior to the Series R preferred stock or\nrepurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for\nconsideration shares of our common stock,\nother securities ranking junior to the Series\nR preferred stock or\nParity Stock, subject to certain exceptions,\nunless the full dividends for the then-current\nperiod on all outstanding shares of Series R\npreferred stock have been declared and paid or\ndeclared and a sum sufficient for the payment\nof those\ndividends has been set aside.\n\nWe, at the option of our board of directors or\nany duly authorized committee of our board of\ndirectors,\nmay redeem, subject to the prior approval of\nthe FRB, the Series R preferred stock, in\nwhole or in part, on any dividend payment date\non or after March 15, 2024. In addition,\nwithin 90 days of our good faith determination\nthat a Regulatory\nCapital Treatment Event (as such term is\ndefined in the certificate of designation\n\n83\n\nfor the Series R preferred stock), we, at the\noption of our board of directors or any duly\nauthorized committee of the board of\ndirectors, may, subject to approval of the\nappropriate federal banking agency, redeem in\nwhole, but not in part, the shares of Series R\npreferred stock at the time outstanding prior\nto March 15, 2024. Any redemption shall be at\nthe redemption price of $25,000 per share plus\nan amount equal to any dividends that have\nbeen declared but not paid to the redemption\ndate without accumulation of any undeclared\ndividends. In the event of our voluntary or\ninvoluntary liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding up, the holders of our Series R\npreferred stock are entitled to receive a\nliquidating distribution in the amount of\n$25,000 per share, plus an amount equal to any\ndividends that have been declared but not yet\npaid, without accumulation of any undeclared\ndividends, to the date of liquidation, out of\nour assets legally available for distribution\nto our stockholders, before any distribution\nis made to holders of our common stock or any\nsecurities ranking junior to the Series R\npreferred stock and subject to the rights of\nthe holders of Parity Stock or any of our\nstock ranking senior to the Series R preferred\nstock as to such distribution and the rights\nof our depositors and other creditors. Holders\nof our Series R preferred stock do not have\nany voting rights and are not entitled to\nelect any directors, except as required by law\nand except for the voting rights provided for\nbelow. Whenever dividends payable on any\nshares of Series R preferred stock or any\nclass or series of Voting Parity Stock (as\nsuch term is defined in the certificate of\ndesignation for the Series R preferred stock)\nhave not been declared and paid in an\naggregate amount equal to, as to any class or\nseries, at least six quarterly dividend\nperiods or their equivalent, whether or not\nfor consecutive dividend periods, the holders\nof our Series R preferred stock, voting\ntogether as a class with holders of Voting\nParity Stock whose voting rights are\nexercisable, will be entitled to vote for the\nelection of two additional directors of our\nboard of directors at our next annual meeting\nof stockholders and at each subsequent meeting\nof stockholders, by a plurality of votes cast\n; providedthat our board of directors shall at\nno time include more than two such directors\nand including, for purposes of this\nlimitation, all directors that the holders of\nany series of Voting Parity Stock are entitled\nto elect pursuant to like voting rights. Upon\nthe vesting of such right of such holders, the\nmaximum authorized number of members of our\nboard of directors shall automatically be\nincreased by two and the two vacancies so\ncreated shall be filled by vote of the holders\nof the outstanding Series R preferred stock\n(together with the holders of shares of any\none or more other series of Voting Parity\nStock). At elections for such directors, each\nholder of Series R preferred stock shall be\nentitled to 25 votes for each share held (the\nholders of shares of any other series of\nVoting Parity Stock being entitled to such\nnumber of votes, if any, for each share of\nsuch stock as may be granted to them). The\nright of the holders of the Series R preferred\nstock (voting together as a class with the\nholders of shares of any one or more other\nseries of Voting Parity Stock) to elect such\ndirectors shall continue until such time as we\nhave paid in full dividends for the equivalent\nof at least four quarterly dividend periods or\ntheir equivalent, at which time such right\nwith respect to the Series R preferred stock\nshall terminate, except as provided by law,\nand subject to revesting in the event of each\nand every subsequent nonpayment of dividends.\nUpon any termination of the right of the\nholders of all shares of Series R preferred\nstock and Voting Parity Stock to vote for\ndirectors, the term of office of all such\ndirectors then in office elected by only those\nholders voting as a class shall terminate\nimmediately. Whenever the term of office of\nthe directors elected by such holders voting\nas a class shall end and the special voting\npowers vested in such holders shall have\nexpired, the number of directors shall be such\nnumber as may be provided for in our by-laws.\nIn addition to any other vote required by law\nor our restated certificate of incorporation,\nas amended, so long as any shares of our\nSeries R preferred stock are outstanding, the\nvote or consent of the holders of the\noutstanding shares of our Series R preferred\nstock and outstanding shares of all other\nseries of Voting Parity Stock entitled to vote\non the matter, by a vote of at least 66 2/ 3%\nin voting power of all such outstanding Series\nR preferred stock and such Voting Parity\nStock, voting together as a class, given in\nperson or by proxy, either in writing without\na meeting or at any meeting called for the\npurpose, will be necessary to permit, effect\nor validate any one or more of the following\nactions, whether or not such approval is\nrequired by Delaware law:\n                                              \n       the issuance of any series of          \n       preferred stock or preference stock    \n       ranking senior to the Series R         \n       preferred stock                        \n  \u25cf    with respect to either the payment of  \n       dividends or the distribution of       \n       assets in the event of any voluntary   \n       or involuntary liquidation,            \n       dissolution or winding up;

The Series S preferred stock ranks\nequally with our Parity Stock (as such term is\ndefined in the certificate of designation for\nthe Series S preferred stock) as to payment of\ndividends and distribution of assets upon our\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up.\n\n86\n\nDividends on shares of our Series S preferred\nstock are not mandatory. Holders of our\nSeries S preferred stock are entitled to\nreceive, when, as and if declared by our board\nof directors or any duly authorized committee\nof our board of directors out of legally\navailable assets,\nnon-cumulative cash dividends on the\nliquidation preference amount, which is\n$25,000 per share of Series S preferred stock.\nFrom April 22, 2014 to, but excluding, June\n15, 2024 (the\n\u0093\u0094), these dividends will accrue at a fixed\nrate per annum equal to 5.90%, and from, and\nincluding, June 15, 2024 (the \u0093\u0094), dividends\nwill accrue at a rate per annum equal\nto three-month LIBOR plus 3.11%. Dividends are\npayable semi-annually in arrears on each June\n15 and December 15, commencing December 15,\n2014 and ending June 15, 2024, and quarterly\nin arrears on each March 15, June 15,\nSeptember 15 and December 15, commencing\nSeptember 15, 2024. The right of holders of\nour Series S preferred stock to receive\ndividends is non-cumulative. The Series S\npreferred stock\nwas issued on April 22, 2014, and the first\ndividend payment date was December 15, 2014.\n\nTo the extent we declare dividends on\nthe Series S preferred stock and on any other\nParity Stock but cannot make full payment of\nthose declared dividends, we will allocate the\ndividend payments on a proportional basis\namong the holders of shares of Series S\npreferred stock and\nthe holders of any Parity Stock then\noutstanding where the terms of such Parity\nStock provide similar dividend rights.

Series S Depositary\nShares.Each Series S depositary share issued\nby us represents a 1/25th interest in one\nshare of our Series S preferred stock. The\nshares of our Series S preferred stock are\ndeposited with Equiniti Trust Company, as\ndepositary. Pursuant to the deposit agreement,\nthe depositary issued Series S depositary\nshares, which are evidenced by depositary\nreceipts. Equiniti Trust Company acts as\ntransfer agent and registrar and paying agent\nwith respect to the Series S depositary\nshares. The depositary\u0092s office at which the\ndepositary receipts are administered is\nlocated at Equiniti Trust Company, 1110 Centre\nPointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota Heights, MN\n55120. The Series S depositary shares were\nissued in book-entry form through DTC. This\nmeans that actual depositary receipts will not\nbe issued, except in limited circumstances.\nThis means that the Series S depositary shares\nwill be in the form of a single global\ndepositary receipt deposited with a DTC\nnominee. Each beneficial holder must rely on\nthe procedures of DTC and if the Series S\ndepositary shares are held through a broker or\nfinancial institution nominee, the beneficial\nholder must rely on the procedures of such\nbroker or financial institution to assert the\nrights of a depositary receipt holder\ndescribed in this section. The depositary will\ndistribute all cash dividends or other cash\ndistributions received on the Series S\npreferred stock to the holders of record of\nSeries S depositary shares in proportion to\nthe numbers of such depositary shares owned by\neach holder. In the event of a distribution\nother than in cash, the depositary will\ndistribute property received by it to the\nholders of record of the Series S depositary\nshares in proportion to the number of Series S\ndepositary shares held by each holder, unless\nthe depositary determines that it is not\nfeasible to make such distribution, in which\ncase the depositary may, with our approval,\nadopt a method of distribution that it deems\npracticable, including the sale of such\nproperty and distribution of the net proceeds\nfrom such sale to such holders. Record dates\nfor the payment of dividends and other matters\nrelating to the Series S depositary shares are\nthe same as the corresponding record dates for\nthe Series S preferred stock. 89\n\nThe amounts distributed to holders of the\nSeries S depositary shares will be reduced\nby any amounts required to be withheld by the\ndepositary or by us on account of taxes or\nother governmental charges.\n\nIf the\nSeries S preferred stock underlying the Series\nS depositary shares is redeemed (i) after June\n15, 2024, in whole or in part, or (ii) prior\nto June 15, 2024 in whole, but not in part,\ndue to the occurrence of a\nRegulatory Capital Treatment Event, Series S\ndepositary shares will be redeemed with the\nproceeds received by the depositary from the\nredemption of the Series S preferred stock\nheld by the depositary. The redemption price\nper Series S\ndepositary share will be equal to 1/25th of\nthe applicable redemption price per share\npayable with respect to such Series S\npreferred stock (or $1,000 per Series S\ndepositary share), plus an amount equal to any\ndeclared and unpaid\ndividends, without accumulation of any\nundeclared dividends. If less than all the\nSeries S preferred stock is redeemed after\nJune 15, 2024, the Series S depositary shares\nto be redeemed will be selected pro rata, or\nin any other\nmanner determined by the depositary to be fair\nand equitable.\n\nWhen the depositary receives notice of any\nmeeting at which the holders of\nthe Series S preferred stock are entitled to\nvote, the depositary will mail, or otherwise\ntransmit by an authorized method, the\ninformation contained in the notice and any\naccompanying proxy material to the record\nholders of the Series S\ndepositary shares relating to the Series S\npreferred stock. Each record holder of the\nSeries S depositary shares on the record date,\nwhich will be the same date as the record date\nfor the Series S preferred stock, may instruct\nthe\ndepositary to vote the amount of the Series S\npreferred stock represented by the holder\u0092s\nSeries S depositary shares. To the extent\npossible, the depositary will vote the amount\nof the Series S preferred stock represented by\nthe\nSeries S depositary shares in accordance with\nthe instructions it receives. We will agree to\ntake all reasonable actions that the\ndepositary determines are necessary to enable\nthe depositary to vote as instructed. If the\ndepositary does not\nreceive specific instructions from the holders\nof any Series S depositary shares representing\nthe Series S preferred stock, it will not vote\nthe amount of Series S preferred stock\nrepresented by such Series S depositary\nshares.\n\nSeries U Preferred Stock.Our 5.875%\nFixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative\nPerpetual Class A Preferred Stock, Series U,\nwhich we refer to as our\n\u0093,\u0094 with no par value, ranks senior to our\ncommon stock and to any other securities that\nwe may issue in the future that are expressly\nmade junior to our Series U preferred stock,\nas to payment of dividends\nand/or distribution of assets upon our\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up.

Each holder of the Series U preferred\nstock will have 25 votes per share on any\nmatter on which holders of the Series U\npreferred stock are entitled to vote, whether\nseparately or together with any other series\nof our stock (the holders of any shares of any\nother series of stock being entitled to such\nnumber of votes, if any, for each share of\nstock as may be granted to them), pursuant to\nDelaware law or otherwise, including by\nwritten consent. 92\n\nSeries U Depositary Shares. Each Series U\ndepositary share issued by us\nrepresents a 1/25th interest in one share of\nour Series U preferred stock. The shares of\nour Series U preferred stock are deposited\nwith Equiniti Trust Company, as depositary.\nPursuant to the deposit agreement, the\ndepositary issued Series U\ndepositary shares, which are evidenced by\ndepositary receipts.\n\nEquiniti Trust Company acts as transfer agent\nand registrar and paying\nagent with respect to the Series U depositary\nshares.\n\nThe depositary\u0092s office at which the\ndepositary receipts are\nadministered is located at Equiniti Trust\nCompany, 1110 Centre Pointe Curve, Suite 101,\nMendota Heights, MN 55120.\n\nThe Series U\ndepositary shares were issued in book-entry\nform through DTC. This means that actual\ndepositary receipts will not be issued, except\nin limited circumstances. This means that the\nSeries U depositary shares will be in the form\nof a single global\ndepositary receipt deposited with a DTC\nnominee. Each beneficial holder must rely on\nthe procedures of DTC and if the Series U\ndepositary shares are held through a broker or\nfinancial institution nominee, the beneficial\nholder must rely on the\nprocedures of such broker or financial\ninstitution to assert the rights of a\ndepositary receipt holder described in this\nsection.\n\nThe\ndepositary will distribute all cash dividends\nor other cash distributions received on the\nSeries U preferred stock to the holders of\nrecord of Series U depositary shares in\nproportion to the numbers of such depositary\nshares owned by each\nholder. In the event of a distribution other\nthan in cash, the depositary will distribute\nproperty received by it to the holders of\nrecord of the Series U depositary shares in\nproportion to the number of Series U\ndepositary shares held by each\nholder, unless the depositary determines that\nit is not feasible to make such distribution,\nin which case the depositary may, with our\napproval, adopt a method of distribution that\nit deems practicable, including the sale of\nsuch property and\ndistribution of the net proceeds from such\nsale to such holders.\n\nRecord dates for the payment of dividends and\nother matters relating to\nthe Series U depositary shares are the same as\nthe corresponding record dates for the Series\nU preferred stock.\n\nThe amounts distributed\nto holders of the Series U depositary shares\nwill be reduced by any amounts required to be\nwithheld by the depositary or by us on account\nof taxes or other governmental charges.\n\nIf the Series U preferred stock underlying the\nSeries U depositary shares is redeemed (i)\nafter June 15, 2025, in whole or in part,\nor (ii) prior to June 15, 2025 in whole, but\nnot in part, due to the occurrence of a\nRegulatory Capital Treatment Event, Series U\ndepositary shares will be redeemed with the\nproceeds received by the depositary from the\nredemption of the\nSeries U preferred stock held by the\ndepositary. The redemption price per Series U\ndepositary share will be equal to 1/25th of\nthe applicable redemption price per share\npayable with respect to such Series U\npreferred stock (or $1,000 per Series\nU depositary share), plus an amount equal to\nany declared and unpaid dividends, without\naccumulation of any undeclared dividends. If\nless than all the Series U preferred stock is\nredeemed after June 15, 2025, the Series U\ndepositary shares\nto be redeemed will be selected pro rata, or\nin any other manner determined by the\ndepositary to be fair and equitable.\n\nWhen the\ndepositary receives notice of any meeting at\nwhich the holders of the Series U preferred\nstock are entitled to vote, the depositary\nwill mail, or otherwise transmit by an\nauthorized method, the information contained\nin the notice and any\naccompanying proxy material to the record\nholders of the Series U depositary shares\nrelating to the Series U preferred stock. Each\nrecord holder of the Series U depositary\nshares on the record date, which will be the\nsame date as the record date for\nthe Series U preferred stock, may instruct the\ndepositary to vote the amount of the Series U\npreferred stock represented by the holder\u0092s\nSeries U depositary shares. To the extent\npossible, the depositary will vote the amount\nof the Series U\npreferred stock represented by the Series U\ndepositary shares in accordance with the\ninstructions it receives. We will agree to\ntake all reasonable actions that the\ndepositary determines are necessary to enable\nthe depositary to vote as instructed.\nIf the\n\n93\n\ndepositary does not receive specific\ninstructions from the holders of any Series U\ndepositary shares representing the Series U\npreferred stock, it will not vote the amount\nof Series U preferred\nstock represented by such Series U depositary\nshares.\n\nSeries Y Preferred Stock.Our\nNon-Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred\nStock, Series Y, which we refer to as our \u0093,\u0094\nwith no par value, ranks senior to our common\nstock and to any other\nsecurities that we may issue in the future\nthat are expressly made junior to our Series Y\npreferred stock, as to payment of dividends\nand/or distribution of assets upon our\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up. The\nSeries Y preferred stock ranks\nequally with our Parity Stock (as such term is\ndefined in the certificate of designation for\nthe Series Y preferred stock) as to payment of\ndividends and distribution of assets upon our\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up.\n\nDividends on shares of our Series Y preferred\nstock are not mandatory. Holders of our Series\nY preferred stock are entitled to receive,\nwhen,\nas and if declared by our board of directors\nor any duly authorized committee of our board\nof directors out of legally available assets,\nnon-cumulative cash dividends on the\nliquidation preference amount,\nwhich is $25,000 per share of Series Y\npreferred stock. These dividends accrue at a\nrate per annum equal to 5.625%, payable\nquarterly in arrears on each March 15, June\n15, September 15 and December 15. The right of\nholders of our\nSeries Y preferred stock to receive dividends\nis non-cumulative. The Series Y preferred\nstock was issued on April 24, 2017, and the\nfirst dividend payment date was June 15, 2017.\n\nTo the extent we declare dividends on the\nSeries Y preferred stock and on any other\nParity Stock but cannot make full payment of\nthose\ndeclared dividends, we will allocate the\ndividend payments on a proportional basis\namong the holders of shares of Series Y\npreferred stock and the holders of any Parity\nStock then outstanding where the terms of such\nParity Stock provide similar\ndividend rights. No interest will be payable\nin respect of any dividend payment that may be\nin arrears.\n\nWe cannot pay dividends on our\ncommon stock or other securities ranking\njunior to the Series Y preferred stock or\nrepurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for\nconsideration shares of our common stock,\nother securities ranking junior to the Series\nY preferred stock or Parity Stock,\nsubject to certain exceptions, unless the full\ndividends for the then-current period on all\noutstanding shares of Series Y preferred stock\nhave been declared and paid or declared and a\nsum sufficient for the payment of those\ndividends has been set\naside.\n\nWe, at the option of our board of directors or\nany duly authorized committee of our board of\ndirectors, may redeem, subject to\nthe prior approval of the FRB, the Series Y\npreferred stock, in whole or in part, on any\ndividend payment date on or after June 15,\n2022. In addition, within 90 days of our good\nfaith determination that a Regulatory Capital\nTreatment Event\n(as such term is defined in the certificate of\ndesignation for the Series Y preferred stock),\nwe, at the option of our board of directors or\nany duly authorized committee of the board of\ndirectors, may, subject to approval of the\nappropriate\nfederal banking agency, redeem in whole, but\nnot in part, the shares of Series Y preferred\nstock at the time outstanding prior to June\n15, 2022. Any redemption shall be at the\nredemption price of $25,000 per share plus an\namount equal to any\ndividends that have been declared but not paid\nto the redemption date without accumulation of\nany undeclared dividends.\n\nIn the event of\nour voluntary or involuntary liquidation,\ndissolution or winding up, the holders of our\nSeries Y preferred stock are entitled to\nreceive a liquidating distribution in the\namount of $25,000 per share, plus an amount\nequal to any dividends that\nhave been declared but not yet paid, without\naccumulation of any undeclared dividends, to\nthe date of liquidation, out of our assets\nlegally available for distribution to our\nstockholders, before any distribution is made\nto holders of our common\nstock or any securities ranking junior to the\nSeries Y preferred stock and subject to the\nrights of the holders of Parity Stock or any\nof our stock ranking senior to the Series Y\npreferred stock as to such distribution and\nthe rights of our\ndepositors and other creditors.\n\nHolders of our Series Y preferred stock do not\nhave any voting rights and are not entitled to\nelect any\ndirectors, except as required by law and\nexcept for the voting rights provided for\nbelow.\n\n94\n\nWhenever dividends payable on any shares of\nSeries Y preferred stock or any class or\nseries of Voting Parity Stock (as such term is\ndefined in the certificate of designation for\nthe Series Y preferred stock) have not been\ndeclared and paid in an aggregate amount equal\nto, as to any class or series, at least six\nquarterly dividend periods or their\nequivalent, whether or not for consecutive\ndividend periods, the holders of our Series Y\npreferred stock, voting together as a class\nwith holders of Voting Parity Stock whose\nvoting rights are exercisable, will be\nentitled to vote for the election of two\nadditional directors of our board of directors\nat our next annual meeting of stockholders and\nat each subsequent meeting of stockholders, by\na plurality of votes cast ; providedthat our\nboard of directors shall at no time include\nmore than two such directors and including,\nfor purposes of this limitation, all directors\nthat the holders of any series of Voting\nParity Stock are entitled to elect pursuant to\nlike voting rights. Upon the vesting of such\nright of such holders, the maximum authorized\nnumber of members of our board of directors\nshall automatically be increased by two and\nthe two vacancies so created shall be filled\nby vote of the holders of the outstanding\nSeries Y preferred stock (together with the\nholders of shares of any one or more other\nseries of Voting Parity Stock). At elections\nfor such directors, each holder of Series Y\npreferred stock shall be entitled to 25 votes\nfor each share held (the holders of shares of\nany other series of Voting Parity Stock being\nentitled to such number of votes, if any, for\neach share of such stock as may be granted to\nthem). The right of the holders of the Series\nY preferred stock (voting together as a class\nwith the holders of shares of any one or more\nother series of Voting Parity Stock) to elect\nsuch directors shall continue until such time\nas we have paid in full dividends for the\nequivalent of at least four quarterly dividend\nperiods or their equivalent, at which time\nsuch right with respect to the Series Y\npreferred stock shall terminate, except as\nprovided by law, and subject to revesting in\nthe event of each and every subsequent\nnonpayment of dividends. Upon any termination\nof the right of the holders of all shares of\nSeries Y preferred stock and Voting Parity\nStock to vote for directors, the term of\noffice of all such directors then in office\nelected by only those holders voting as a\nclass shall terminate immediately. Whenever\nthe term of office of the directors elected by\nsuch holders voting as a class shall end and\nthe special voting powers vested in such\nholders shall have expired, the number of\ndirectors shall be such number as may be\nprovided for in our by-laws. In addition to\nany other vote required by law or our restated\ncertificate of incorporation, as amended, so\nlong as any shares of our Series Y preferred\nstock are outstanding, the vote or consent of\nthe holders of the outstanding shares of our\nSeries Y preferred stock and outstanding\nshares of all other series of Voting Parity\nStock entitled to vote on the matter, by a\nvote of at least 66 2/ 3% in voting power of\nall such outstanding Series Y preferred stock\nand such Voting Parity Stock, voting together\nas a class, given in person or by proxy,\neither in writing without a meeting or at any\nmeeting called for the purpose, will be\nnecessary to permit, effect or validate any\none or more of the following actions, whether\nor not such approval is required by Delaware\nlaw:\n                                              \n       the issuance of any series of          \n       preferred stock or preference stock    \n       ranking senior to the Series Y         \n       preferred stock                        \n  \u25cf    with respect to either the payment of  \n       dividends or the distribution of       \n       assets in the event of any voluntary   \n       or involuntary liquidation,            \n       dissolution or winding up;             \n                                              \n                                              \n       any amendment, alteration or repeal    \n       of any provision of our restated       \n       certificate of incorporation, as       \n       amended                                \n       (including the certificate of          \n  \u25cf    designation relating to the Series\u00a0Y   \n       preferred stock) or our by-laws that   \n       would adversely affect the rights,     \n       preferences, privileges or voting      \n       powers of the Series Y                 \n       preferred stock;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       any amendment or alteration of our     \n       restated certificate of                \n       incorporation, as amended, or by-laws  \n       to authorize, create or increase the   \n       authorized amount of, any shares of,   \n       or any securities convertible into     \n  \u25cf    shares of, any class or series of our  \n       capital stock ranking senior to the    \n       Series Y preferred stock               \n       with respect to either payment of      \n       dividends or the distribution of       \n       assets in the event of any voluntary   \n       or involuntary liquidation,            \n       dissolution or winding up; or          \n                                              \n                                              \n       the consummation of a                  \n       reclassification involving the Series  \n  \u25cf    Y preferred stock or a merger or       \n       consolidation with                     \n       another corporation or other entity,   \n       except holders of the                  \n                                              \n95\n                                              \n  Series Y preferred stock will have no       \n  right to vote under this provision if in    \n  each case (i)\u00a0the shares of Series Y        \n  preferred stock remain outstanding or, in   \n  the case of any such merger or              \n  consolidation with respect to which we are  \n  not the surviving or resulting entity, are  \n  converted into or exchanged for preference  \n  securities of the surviving or resulting    \n  entity or its ultimate parent, and (ii)\u00a0    \n  such shares of Series Y preferred           \n  stock remaining outstanding or such         \n  preference securities, as the case may be,  \n  have such rights, preferences, privileges   \n  and voting powers, taken as a whole, as     \n  are not materially less favorable to the    \n  holders thereof than the rights,            \n  preferences,                                \n  privileges and voting powers of the Series  \n  Y preferred stock, taken as a whole;        \n                                              \nprovided, however, that any authorization,\ncreation or increase in the authorized amount\nof or issuance of our Series Y preferred stock\nor any class or series of Parity Stock or\nsecurities ranking junior to the Series Y\npreferred stock or any securities convertible\ninto any class or series of Parity Stock\n(whether dividends payable in respect of such\nParity Stock are cumulative or non-\ncumulative)or securities ranking junior to the\nSeries Y preferred stock will be deemed not to\nadversely affect the rights, preferences,\nprivileges or voting powers of the Series Y\npreferred stock, and holders of the Series Y\npreferred stock shall have no right to vote\nthereon.

Each beneficial holder must rely on\nthe procedures of DTC and if the Series Y\ndepositary shares are held through a broker or\nfinancial institution nominee, the beneficial\nholder must rely on the procedures of such\nbroker or financial institution to assert the\nrights of a depositary receipt holder\ndescribed in this section. The depositary will\ndistribute all cash dividends or other cash\ndistributions received on the Series Y\npreferred stock to the holders of record of\nSeries Y depositary shares in proportion to\nthe numbers of such depositary shares owned by\neach holder. In the event of a distribution\nother than in cash, the depositary will\ndistribute property received by it to the\nholders of record of the Series Y depositary\nshares in proportion to the number of Series Y\ndepositary shares held by each holder, unless\nthe depositary determines that it is not\nfeasible to make such distribution, in which\ncase the depositary may, with our approval,\nadopt a method of distribution that it deems\npracticable, including the sale of such\nproperty and distribution of the net proceeds\nfrom such sale to such holders. 96\n\nRecord dates for the payment of dividends and\nother matters relating to the Series Y\ndepositary shares are the same as the\ncorresponding record dates for the Series Y\npreferred stock.\n\nThe amounts distributed to holders of\nthe Series Y depositary shares will be reduced\nby any amounts required to be withheld by the\ndepositary or by us on account of taxes or\nother governmental charges.\n\nIf the Series Y preferred stock underlying the\nSeries Y depositary shares is redeemed (i)\nafter June 15, 2022, in whole or in part,\nor (ii) prior to June 15, 2022, in whole, but\nnot in part, due to the occurrence of a\nRegulatory Capital Treatment Event, Series Y\ndepositary shares will be redeemed with the\nproceeds received by the depositary from the\nredemption of\nthe Series Y preferred stock held by the\ndepositary. The redemption price per Series Y\ndepositary share will be equal to 1/1,000th of\nthe applicable redemption price per share\npayable with respect to such Series Y\npreferred stock (or $25 per\nSeries Y depositary share), plus an amount\nequal to any declared and unpaid dividends,\nwithout accumulation of any undeclared\ndividends. If less than all the Series Y\npreferred stock is redeemed after June 15,\n2022, the Series Y depositary\nshares to be redeemed will be selected pro\nrata, or in any other manner consistent with\nthe rules and policies of the NYSE as the\ndepositary may determine to be fair and\nequitable.\n\nWhen the depositary receives notice of any\nmeeting at which the holders of the Series Y\npreferred stock are entitled to vote, the\ndepositary\nwill mail, or otherwise transmit by an\nauthorized method, the information contained\nin the notice and any accompanying proxy\nmaterial to the record holders of the Series Y\ndepositary shares relating to the Series Y\npreferred stock. Each record\nholder of the Series Y depositary shares on\nthe record date, which will be the same date\nas the record date for the Series Y preferred\nstock, may instruct the depositary to vote the\namount of the Series Y preferred stock\nrepresented by the\nholder\u0092s Series Y depositary shares. To the\nextent possible, the depositary will vote the\namount of the Series Y preferred stock\nrepresented by the Series Y depositary shares\nin accordance with the instructions it\nreceives. We will agree\nto take all reasonable actions that the\ndepositary determines are necessary to enable\nthe depositary to vote as instructed. If the\ndepositary does not receive specific\ninstructions from the holders of any Series Y\ndepositary shares representing the\nSeries Y preferred stock, it will not vote the\namount of Series Y preferred stock represented\nby such Series Y depositary shares.\n\nSeries Z Preferred Stock.Our Non-Cumulative\nPerpetual Class A Preferred Stock,\nSeries Z, which we refer to as our \u0093,\u0094 with no\npar value, ranks senior to our common stock\nand to any other securities that we may issue\nin the future that are expressly made junior\nto our Series Z preferred\nstock, as to payment of dividends and/or\ndistribution of assets upon our liquidation,\ndissolution or winding up. The Series Z\npreferred stock ranks equally with our Parity\nStock (as such term is defined in the\ncertificate of designation for the\nSeries Z preferred stock) as to payment of\ndividends and distribution of assets upon our\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up.\n\nDividends on shares of our Series Z preferred\nstock are not mandatory. Holders of our Series\nZ preferred stock are entitled to receive,\nwhen,\nas and if declared by our board of directors\nor any duly authorized committee of our board\nof directors out of legally available assets,\nnon-cumulative cash dividends on the\nliquidation preference amount,\nwhich is $25,000 per share of Series Z\npreferred stock. These dividends accrue at a\nrate per annum equal to 4.75%, payable\nquarterly in arrears on each March 15, June\n15, September 15 and December 15. The right of\nholders of our\nSeries Z preferred stock to receive dividends\nis non-cumulative. The Series Z preferred\nstock was issued on January 27, 2020, and the\nfirst dividend payment date was March 15,\n2020.\n\nTo the extent we declare dividends on the\nSeries Z preferred stock and on any other\nParity Stock but cannot make full payment of\nthose\ndeclared dividends, we will allocate the\ndividend payments on a proportional basis\namong the holders of shares of Series Z\npreferred stock and the holders of any Parity\nStock then outstanding where the terms of such\nParity Stock provide similar\ndividend rights. No interest will be payable\nin respect of any dividend payment that may be\nin arrears.\n\n97\n\nWe cannot pay dividends on our common stock or\nother securities ranking junior to the\nSeries Z preferred stock or repurchase, redeem\nor otherwise acquire for consideration shares\nof our common stock, other securities ranking\njunior to the Series Z preferred stock or\nParity Stock, subject to certain exceptions,\nunless the full\ndividends for the then-current period on all\noutstanding shares of Series Z preferred stock\nhave been declared and paid or declared and a\nsum sufficient for the payment of those\ndividends has been set aside.\n\nWe, at the option of our board of directors or\nany duly authorized committee of our board of\ndirectors, may redeem, subject to the prior\napproval of the FRB, the Series Z preferred\nstock, in whole or in part, on any dividend\npayment date on or after March 15, 2025. In\naddition, within 90 days of our good faith\ndetermination that a Regulatory Capital\nTreatment Event (as such\nterm is defined in the certificate of\ndesignation for the Series Z preferred stock),\nwe, at the option of our board of directors or\nany duly authorized committee of the board of\ndirectors, may, subject to approval of the\nappropriate federal\nbanking agency, redeem in whole, but not in\npart, the shares of Series Z preferred stock\nat the time outstanding prior to March 15,\n2025. Any redemption shall be at the\nredemption price of $25,000 per share plus an\namount equal to any dividends\nthat have been declared but not paid to the\nredemption date without accumulation of any\nundeclared dividends.\n\nIn the event of our\nvoluntary or involuntary liquidation,\ndissolution or winding up, the holders of our\nSeries Z preferred stock are entitled to\nreceive a liquidating distribution in the\namount of $25,000 per share, plus an amount\nequal to any dividends that have\nbeen declared but not yet paid, without\naccumulation of any undeclared dividends, to\nthe date of liquidation, out of our assets\nlegally available for distribution to our\nstockholders, before any distribution is made\nto holders of our common stock or\nany securities ranking junior to the Series Z\npreferred stock and subject to the rights of\nthe holders of Parity Stock or any of our\nstock ranking senior to the Series Z preferred\nstock as to such distribution and the rights\nof our depositors\nand other creditors.\n\nHolders of our Series Z preferred stock do not\nhave any voting rights and are not entitled to\nelect any directors,\nexcept as required by law and except for the\nvoting rights provided for below.\n\nWhenever dividends payable on any shares of\nSeries Z\npreferred stock or any class or series of\nVoting Parity Stock (as such term is defined\nin the certificate of designation for the\nSeries Z preferred stock) have not been\ndeclared and paid in an aggregate amount equal\nto, as to any class or series, at\nleast six quarterly dividend periods or their\nequivalent, whether or not for consecutive\ndividend periods, the holders of our Series Z\npreferred stock, voting together as a class\nwith holders of Voting Parity Stock whose\nvoting rights are\nexercisable, will be entitled to vote for the\nelection of two additional directors of our\nboard of directors at our next annual meeting\nof stockholders and at each subsequent meeting\nof stockholders, by a plurality of votes cast;\nprovidedthat our board of directors shall at\nno time include more than two such directors\nand including, for purposes of this\nlimitation, all directors that the holders of\nany series of Voting Parity Stock are entitled\nto elect pursuant to like voting\nrights.

At\nelections for such directors, each holder of\nSeries Z preferred stock shall be entitled to\n25 votes for each share\nheld (the holders of shares of any other\nseries of Voting Parity Stock being entitled\nto such number of votes, if any, for each\nshare of such stock as may be granted to\nthem). The right of the holders of the Series\nZ preferred stock (voting\ntogether as a class with the holders of shares\nof any one or more other series of Voting\nParity Stock) to elect such directors shall\ncontinue until such time as we have paid in\nfull dividends for the equivalent of at least\nfour quarterly dividend\nperiods or their equivalent, at which time\nsuch right with respect to the Series Z\npreferred stock shall terminate, except as\nprovided by law, and subject to revesting in\nthe event of each and every subsequent\nnonpayment of dividends. Upon any\ntermination of the right of the holders of all\nshares of Series Z preferred stock and Voting\nParity Stock to vote for directors, the term\nof office of all such directors then in office\nelected by only those holders voting as a\nclass shall\nterminate immediately.

At elections for such directors, each\nholder of Series AA preferred stock shall be\nentitled to 25 votes for each share held (the\nholders of shares of any other series of\nVoting Parity Stock being entitled to such\nnumber of votes, if any, for each share of\nsuch stock as may be granted to them). The\nright of the holders of the Series AA\npreferred stock (voting together as a class\nwith the holders of shares of any one or more\nother series of Voting Parity Stock) to elect\nsuch directors shall continue until such time\nas we have paid in full dividends for the\nequivalent of at least four quarterly dividend\nperiods or their equivalent, at which time\nsuch right with respect to the Series AA\npreferred stock shall terminate, except as\nprovided by law, and subject to revesting in\nthe event of each and every subsequent\nnonpayment of dividends.

If an amendment, alteration, repeal,\nreclassification, merger or consolidation\ndescribed above would adversely affect one or\nmore but not all series of voting preferred\nstock (including the Series AA preferred stock\nfor this purpose), then only those series\naffected and entitled to vote shall vote as a\nclass in lieu of all such series of preferred\nstock. Each holder of the Series AA preferred\nstock will have 25 votes per share on any\nmatter on which holders of the Series AA\npreferred stock are entitled to vote, whether\nseparately or together with any other series\nof our stock (the holders of any shares of any\nother series of stock being entitled to such\nnumber of votes, if any, for each share of\nstock as may be granted to them), pursuant to\nDelaware law or otherwise, including by\nwritten consent. Series AA Depositary\nShares.Each Series AA depositary share issued\nby us represents a 1/1,000th interest in one\nshare of our Series AA preferred stock. The\nshares of our Series AA preferred stock are\ndeposited with Equiniti Trust Company, as\ndepositary. Pursuant to the deposit agreement,\nthe depositary issued Series AA depositary\nshares, which are evidenced by depositary\nreceipts. Equiniti Trust Company acts as\ntransfer agent and registrar and paying agent\nwith respect to the Series AA depositary\nshares. The depositary\u0092s office at which the\ndepositary receipts are administered is\nlocated at Equiniti Trust Company, 1110 Centre\nPointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota Heights, MN\n55120. The Series AA depositary shares were\nissued in book-entry form through DTC. This\nmeans that actual depositary receipts will not\nbe issued, except in limited circumstances.\nThis means that the Series AA depositary\nshares will be in the form of a single global\ndepositary receipt deposited with a DTC\nnominee. Each beneficial holder must rely on\nthe procedures of DTC and if the Series AA\ndepositary shares are held through a broker or\nfinancial institution nominee, the beneficial\nholder must rely on the procedures of such\nbroker or financial institution to assert the\nrights of a depositary receipt holder\ndescribed in this section. The depositary will\ndistribute all cash dividends or other cash\ndistributions received on the Series AA\npreferred stock to the holders of record of\nSeries AA depositary shares in proportion to\nthe numbers of such 103\n\ndepositary shares owned by each holder. In the\nevent of a distribution other than in cash,\nthe depositary will distribute property\nreceived by it to the holders of record of the\nSeries AA\ndepositary shares in proportion to the number\nof Series AA depositary shares held by each\nholder, unless the depositary determines that\nit is not feasible to make such distribution,\nin which case the depositary may, with our\napproval, adopt a method\nof distribution that it deems practicable,\nincluding the sale of such property and\ndistribution of the net proceeds from such\nsale to such holders.\n\nRecord dates for the payment of dividends and\nother matters relating to the Series AA\ndepositary shares are the same as the\ncorresponding\nrecord dates for the Series AA preferred\nstock.\n\nThe amounts distributed to holders of the\nSeries AA depositary shares will be reduced by\nany amounts required to be withheld by the\ndepositary or by us on account of taxes or\nother governmental charges.\n\nIf the Series AA\npreferred stock underlying the Series AA\ndepositary shares is redeemed (i) after\nDecember 15, 2025, in whole or in part, or\n(ii) prior to December 15, 2025, in whole, but\nnot in part, due to the occurrence of a\nRegulatory Capital\nTreatment Event, Series AA depositary shares\nwill be redeemed with the proceeds received by\nthe depositary from the redemption of the\nSeries AA preferred stock held by the\ndepositary. The redemption price per Series AA\ndepositary share will be equal\nto 1/1,000th of the applicable redemption\nprice per share payable with respect to such\nSeries AA preferred stock (or $25 per Series\nAA depositary share), plus an amount equal to\nany declared and unpaid dividends, without\naccumulation of any\nundeclared dividends. If less than all the\nSeries AA preferred stock is redeemed after\nDecember 15, 2025, the Series AA depositary\nshares to be redeemed will be selected pro\nrata, or in any other manner consistent with\nthe rules and policies of\nthe NYSE as the depositary may determine to be\nfair and equitable.\n\nWhen the depositary receives notice of any\nmeeting at which the\nholders of the Series AA preferred stock are\nentitled to vote, the depositary will mail, or\notherwise transmit by an authorized method,\nthe information contained in the notice and\nany accompanying proxy material to the record\nholders of the Series\nAA depositary shares relating to the Series AA\npreferred stock. Each record holder of the\nSeries AA depositary shares on the record\ndate, which will be the same date as the\nrecord date for the Series AA preferred stock,\nmay instruct the depositary\nto vote the amount of the Series AA preferred\nstock represented by the holder\u0092s Series AA\ndepositary shares. To the extent possible, the\ndepositary will vote the amount of the Series\nAA preferred stock represented by the Series\nAA depositary\nshares in accordance with the instructions it\nreceives. We will agree to take all reasonable\nactions that the depositary determines are\nnecessary to enable the depositary to vote as\ninstructed. If the depositary does not receive\nspecific\ninstructions from the holders of any Series AA\ndepositary shares representing the Series AA\npreferred stock, it will not vote the amount\nof Series AA preferred stock represented by\nsuch Series AA depositary shares.\n\nSeries BB Preferred Stock.Our Non-Cumulative\nPerpetual Class A Preferred Stock,\nSeries BB, which we refer to as our \u0093,\u0094 with\nno par value, ranks senior to our common stock\nand to any other securities that we may issue\nin the future that are expressly made junior\nto our Series BB\npreferred stock, as to payment of dividends\nand/or distribution of assets upon our\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up. The\nSeries BB preferred stock ranks equally with\nour Parity Stock (as such term is defined in\nthe certificate of designation\nfor the Series BB preferred stock) as to\npayment of dividends and distribution of\nassets upon our liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding up.\n\nDividends on shares of our Series BB preferred\nstock are not mandatory. Holders of our Series\nBB preferred stock are entitled to receive,\nwhen, as and if declared by our board of\ndirectors or any duly authorized committee of\nour board of directors out of legally\navailable assets, non-cumulative cash\ndividends on the liquidation preference\namount, which is $25,000 per share of Series\nBB preferred stock. These dividends accrue (i)\nat a rate per annum equal to 3.90% from, and\nincluding, January 26, 2021 to, but excluding,\nMarch 15, 2026 (the \u0093\u0094) and (ii) the five-year\ntreasury rate as of the most recent reset\ndividend determination date plus 3.453% for\neach reset period, from, and including, the\nfirst reset date, commencing June 15, 2026 (as\neach\n\n104\n\nterm is defined in the certificate of\ndesignation for the Series BB preferred\nstock). Dividends will be payable quarterly in\narrears on each March 15, June 15, September\n15 and\nDecember 15. The right of holders of our\nSeries BB preferred stock to receive dividends\nis non-cumulative. The Series BB preferred\nstock was issued on January 26, 2021, and the\nfirst dividend payment\ndate was March 15, 2021. The calculation agent\nfor the Series BB preferred stock will be\nappointed prior to the first reset dividend\ndetermination date.\n\nTo the extent we declare dividends on the\nSeries BB preferred stock and on any other\nParity Stock but cannot make full payment of\nthose\ndeclared dividends, we will allocate the\ndividend payments on a proportional basis\namong the holders of shares of Series BB\npreferred stock and the holders of any Parity\nStock then outstanding where the terms of such\nParity Stock provide similar\ndividend rights. No interest will be payable\nin respect of any dividend payment that may be\nin arrears.\n\nWe cannot pay dividends on our\ncommon stock or other securities ranking\njunior to the Series BB preferred stock or\nrepurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for\nconsideration shares of our common stock,\nother securities ranking junior to the Series\nBB preferred stock or Parity\nStock, subject to certain exceptions, unless\nthe full dividends for the then-current period\non all outstanding shares of Series BB\npreferred stock have been declared and paid or\ndeclared and a sum sufficient for the payment\nof those dividends has\nbeen set aside.\n\nWe, at the option of our board of directors or\nany duly authorized committee of our board of\ndirectors, may redeem,\nsubject to the prior approval of the FRB, the\nSeries BB preferred stock, in whole or in\npart, on any dividend payment date on or after\nMarch 15, 2026. In addition, within 90 days of\nour good faith determination that a Regulatory\nCapital\nTreatment Event (as such term is defined in\nthe certificate of designation for the Series\nBB preferred stock), we, at the option of our\nboard of directors or any duly authorized\ncommittee of the board of directors, may,\nsubject to approval of the\nappropriate federal banking agency, redeem in\nwhole, but not in part, the shares of Series\nBB preferred stock at the time outstanding\nprior to March 15, 2026. Any redemption shall\nbe at the redemption price of $25,000 per\nshare plus an amount\nequal to any dividends that have been declared\nbut not paid to the redemption date without\naccumulation of any undeclared dividends.\n\nIn\nthe event of our voluntary or involuntary\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up, the\nholders of our Series BB preferred stock are\nentitled to receive a liquidating distribution\nin the amount of $25,000 per share, plus an\namount equal to any\ndividends that have been declared but not yet\npaid, without accumulation of any undeclared\ndividends, to the date of liquidation, out of\nour assets legally available for distribution\nto our stockholders, before any distribution\nis made to holders of\nour common stock or any securities ranking\njunior to the Series BB preferred stock and\nsubject to the rights of the holders of Parity\nStock or any of our stock ranking senior to\nthe Series BB preferred stock as to such\ndistribution and the rights of\nour depositors and other creditors.\n\nHolders of our Series BB preferred stock do\nnot have any voting rights and are not\nentitled to elect\nany directors, except as required by law and\nexcept for the voting rights provided for\nbelow.\n\nWhenever dividends payable on any shares\nof Series BB preferred stock or any class or\nseries of Voting Parity Stock (as such term is\ndefined in the certificate of designation for\nthe Series BB preferred stock) have not been\ndeclared and paid in an aggregate amount equal\nto, as to any class\nor series, at least six quarterly dividend\nperiods or their equivalent, whether or not\nfor consecutive dividend periods, the holders\nof our Series BB preferred stock, voting\ntogether as a class with holders of Voting\nParity Stock whose voting\nrights are exercisable, will be entitled to\nvote for the election of two additional\ndirectors of our board of directors at our\nnext annual meeting of stockholders and at\neach subsequent meeting of stockholders, by a\nplurality of votes cast; providedthat our\nboard of directors shall at no time include\nmore than two such directors and including,\nfor purposes of this limitation, all directors\nthat the holders of any series of Voting\nParity Stock are entitled to elect pursuant to\nlike\nvoting rights. Upon the vesting of such right\nof such holders, the maximum authorized number\nof members of our board of directors shall\nautomatically be increased by two and the two\nvacancies so created shall be filled by vote\nof the holders of the\noutstanding Series BB preferred stock\n(together with the holders of shares of any\none or more other series of Voting Parity\nStock). At elections for such directors, each\nholder of Series BB\n\n105\n\npreferred stock shall be entitled to 25 votes\nfor each share held (the holders of shares of\nany other series of Voting Parity Stock being\nentitled to such number of votes, if any, for\neach share of such stock as may be granted to\nthem). The right of the holders of the Series\nBB preferred stock (voting together as a class\nwith the holders of shares of any one or more\nother series of Voting Parity Stock) to elect\nsuch directors shall continue until such time\nas we have paid in full dividends for the\nequivalent of at least four quarterly dividend\nperiods or their equivalent, at which time\nsuch right with respect to the Series BB\npreferred stock shall terminate, except as\nprovided by law, and subject to revesting in\nthe event of each and every subsequent\nnonpayment of dividends. Upon any termination\nof the right of the holders of all shares of\nSeries BB preferred stock and Voting Parity\nStock to vote for directors, the term of\noffice of all such directors then in office\nelected by only those holders voting as a\nclass shall terminate immediately. Whenever\nthe term of office of the directors elected by\nsuch holders voting as a class shall end and\nthe special voting powers vested in such\nholders shall have expired, the number of\ndirectors shall be such number as may be\nprovided for in our by-laws. In addition to\nany other vote required by law or our restated\ncertificate of incorporation, as amended, so\nlong as any shares of our Series BB preferred\nstock are outstanding, the vote or consent of\nthe holders of the outstanding shares of our\nSeries BB preferred stock and outstanding\nshares of all other series of Voting Parity\nStock entitled to vote on the matter, by a\nvote of at least 66 2/ 3% in voting power of\nall such outstanding Series BB preferred stock\nand such Voting Parity Stock, voting together\nas a class, given in person or by proxy,\neither in writing without a meeting or at any\nmeeting called for the purpose, will be\nnecessary to permit, effect or validate any\none or more of the following actions, whether\nor not such approval is required by Delaware\nlaw:\n                                              \n       the issuance of any series of          \n       preferred stock or preference stock    \n       ranking senior to the Series BB        \n       preferred stock                        \n  \u25cf    with respect to either the payment of  \n       dividends or the distribution of       \n       assets in the event of any voluntary   \n       or involuntary liquidation,            \n       dissolution or winding up;

This means that\nactual depositary receipts will not be issued,\nexcept in limited circumstances. This means\nthat the Series BB depositary shares will be\nin the form of a single global depositary\nreceipt deposited with a DTC nominee. Each\nbeneficial holder must rely\non the procedures of DTC and if the Series BB\ndepositary shares are held through a broker or\nfinancial institution nominee, the beneficial\nholder must rely on the procedures of such\nbroker or financial institution to assert the\nrights of a\ndepositary receipt holder described in this\nsection.\n\nThe depositary will distribute all cash\ndividends or other cash distributions\nreceived on the Series BB preferred stock to\nthe holders of record of Series BB depositary\nshares in proportion to the numbers of such\ndepositary shares owned by each holder. In the\nevent of a distribution other than in cash,\nthe depositary\nwill distribute property received by it to the\nholders of record of the Series BB depositary\nshares in proportion to the number of Series\nBB depositary shares held by each holder,\nunless the depositary determines that it is\nnot feasible to make such\ndistribution, in which case the depositary\nmay, with our approval, adopt a method of\ndistribution that it deems practicable,\nincluding the sale of such property and\ndistribution of the net proceeds from such\nsale to such holders.\n\nRecord dates for the payment of dividends and\nother matters relating to the Series BB\ndepositary shares are the same as the\ncorresponding\nrecord dates for the Series BB preferred\nstock.\n\nThe amounts distributed to holders of the\nSeries BB depositary shares will be reduced by\nany amounts required to be withheld by the\ndepositary or by us on account of taxes or\nother governmental charges.\n\nIf the Series BB\npreferred stock underlying the Series BB\ndepositary shares is redeemed (i) after March\n15, 2026, in whole or in part, or (ii) prior\nto March 15, 2026, in whole, but not in part,\ndue to the occurrence of a Regulatory Capital\nTreatment Event, Series BB depositary shares\nwill be redeemed with the\n\n107\n\nproceeds received by the depositary from the\nredemption of the Series BB preferred stock\nheld by the depositary. The redemption price\nper Series BB depositary share will be equal\nto\n1/25th of the applicable redemption price per\nshare payable with respect to such Series BB\npreferred stock (or $1,000 per Series BB\ndepositary share), plus an amount equal to any\ndeclared and unpaid dividends, without\naccumulation of any\nundeclared dividends. If less than all the\nSeries BB preferred stock is redeemed after\nMarch 15, 2026, the Series BB depositary\nshares to be redeemed will be selected pro\nrata, or in any other manner consistent with\nthe rules and policies of\nthe NYSE as the depositary may determine to be\nfair and equitable.\n\nWhen the depositary receives notice of any\nmeeting at which the\nholders of the Series BB preferred stock are\nentitled to vote, the depositary will mail, or\notherwise transmit by an authorized method,\nthe information contained in the notice and\nany accompanying proxy material to the record\nholders of the Series\nBB depositary shares relating to the Series BB\npreferred stock.

To the extent possible, the\ndepositary will vote the amount of the Series\nBB preferred stock represented by the Series\nBB depositary\nshares in accordance with the instructions it\nreceives.

The\nSeries CC preferred stock ranks equally with\nour Parity Stock (as such term is defined in\nthe certificate of designation\nfor the Series CC preferred stock) as to\npayment of dividends and distribution of\nassets upon our liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding up.\n\nDividends on shares of our Series CC preferred\nstock are not mandatory. Holders of our Series\nCC preferred stock are entitled to receive,\nwhen, as and if declared by our board of\ndirectors or any duly authorized committee of\nour board of directors out of legally\navailable assets, non-cumulative cash\ndividends on the liquidation preference\namount, which is $25,000 per share of Series\nCC preferred stock. These dividends accrue at\na rate per annum equal to 4.375%, payable\nquarterly in arrears on each March 15, June\n15, September 15 and December 15. The right of\nholders of our Series CC preferred stock to\nreceive dividends is non-cumulative. The\nSeries CC preferred stock was originally\nissued on February 1, 2021. On February 9,\n2021, an additional issuance\nof Series CC preferred stock occurred due to\nthe partial exercise of an over-allotment\noption granted to the underwriters. The first\ndividend payment date was March 15, 2021.\n\nTo the extent we declare dividends on the\nSeries CC preferred stock and on any other\nParity Stock but cannot make full payment of\nthose\ndeclared dividends, we will allocate the\ndividend payments on a proportional basis\namong the holders of shares of Series CC\npreferred stock and the holders of any Parity\nStock then outstanding where the terms of such\nParity Stock provide similar\ndividend rights. No interest will be payable\nin respect of any dividend payment that may be\nin arrears.\n\nWe cannot pay dividends on our\ncommon stock or other securities ranking\njunior to the Series CC preferred stock or\nrepurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for\nconsideration shares of our common stock,\nother securities ranking junior to the Series\nCC preferred stock or Parity\nStock, subject to certain exceptions, unless\nthe full dividends for the then-current period\non all outstanding shares of Series CC\npreferred stock have been declared and paid or\ndeclared and a sum sufficient for the payment\nof those dividends has\nbeen set aside.\n\n108\n\nWe, at the option of our board of directors or\nany duly authorized committee of our board\nof directors, may redeem, subject to the prior\napproval of the FRB, the Series CC preferred\nstock, in whole or in part, on any dividend\npayment date on or after March 15, 2026. In\naddition, within 90 days of our good faith\ndetermination that a\nRegulatory Capital Treatment Event (as such\nterm is defined in the certificate of\ndesignation for the Series CC preferred\nstock), we, at the option of our board of\ndirectors or any duly authorized committee of\nthe board of directors, may, subject to\napproval of the appropriate federal banking\nagency, redeem in whole, but not in part, the\nshares of Series CC preferred stock at the\ntime outstanding prior to March 15, 2026. Any\nredemption shall be at the redemption price of\n$25,000 per share\nplus an amount equal to any dividends that\nhave been declared but not paid to the\nredemption date without accumulation of any\nundeclared dividends.\n\nIn the event of our voluntary or involuntary\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up, the\nholders of our Series CC preferred stock are\nentitled to receive a liquidating distribution\nin the amount of $25,000 per share, plus an\namount equal to any dividends that have been\ndeclared but not yet paid, without\naccumulation of any undeclared dividends, to\nthe date of liquidation, out of\nour assets legally available for distribution\nto our stockholders, before any distribution\nis made to holders of our common stock or any\nsecurities ranking junior to the Series CC\npreferred stock and subject to the rights of\nthe holders of Parity\nStock or any of our stock ranking senior to\nthe Series CC preferred stock as to such\ndistribution and the rights of our depositors\nand other creditors.\n\nHolders of our Series CC preferred stock do\nnot have any voting rights and are not\nentitled to elect any directors, except as\nrequired by law\nand except for the voting rights provided for\nbelow.\n\nWhenever dividends payable on any shares of\nSeries CC preferred stock or any class\nor series of Voting Parity Stock (as such term\nis defined in the certificate of designation\nfor the Series CC preferred stock) have not\nbeen declared and paid in an aggregate amount\nequal to, as to any class or series, at least\nsix quarterly\ndividend periods or their equivalent, whether\nor not for consecutive dividend periods, the\nholders of our Series CC preferred stock,\nvoting together as a class with holders of\nVoting Parity Stock whose voting rights are\nexercisable, will be\nentitled to vote for the election of two\nadditional directors of our board of directors\nat our next annual meeting of stockholders and\nat each subsequent meeting of stockholders, by\na plurality of votes cast; providedthat our\nboard of\ndirectors shall at no time include more than\ntwo such directors and including, for purposes\nof this limitation, all directors that the\nholders of any series of Voting Parity Stock\nare entitled to elect pursuant to like voting\nrights. Upon the\nvesting of such right of such holders, the\nmaximum authorized number of members of our\nboard of directors shall automatically be\nincreased by two and the two vacancies so\ncreated shall be filled by vote of the holders\nof the outstanding Series CC\npreferred stock (together with the holders of\nshares of any one or more other series of\nVoting Parity Stock). At elections for such\ndirectors, each holder of Series CC preferred\nstock shall be entitled to 25 votes for each\nshare held (the holders of\nshares of any other series of Voting Parity\nStock being entitled to such number of votes,\nif any, for each share of such stock as may be\ngranted to them). The right of the holders of\nthe Series CC preferred stock (voting together\nas a class with the\nholders of shares of any one or more other\nseries of Voting Parity Stock) to elect such\ndirectors shall continue until such time as we\nhave paid in full dividends for the equivalent\nof at least four quarterly dividend periods or\ntheir equivalent, at\nwhich time such right with respect to the\nSeries CC preferred stock shall terminate,\nexcept as provided by law, and subject to\nrevesting in the event of each and every\nsubsequent nonpayment of dividends. Upon any\ntermination of the right of the\nholders of all shares of Series CC preferred\nstock and Voting Parity Stock to vote for\ndirectors, the term of office of all such\ndirectors then in office elected by only those\nholders voting as a class shall terminate\nimmediately. Whenever the term\nof office of the directors elected by such\nholders voting as a class shall end and the\nspecial voting powers vested in such holders\nshall have expired, the number of directors\nshall be such number as may be provided for in\nour by-laws.\n\nIn addition to any other vote required by law\nor our restated certificate of incorporation,\nas amended, so long as any shares of our\nSeries CC preferred stock are outstanding, the\nvote or consent of the holders of the\noutstanding shares of our Series CC preferred\nstock and outstanding shares of all other\nseries of Voting Parity Stock\nentitled to vote on the matter, by a vote of\nat least 66/% in voting power of all such\noutstanding Series CC preferred stock and\nsuch Voting Parity Stock, voting together as a\nclass, given in person or\n\n109\n\nby proxy, either in writing without a meeting\nor at any meeting called for the purpose, will\nbe necessary to permit, effect or validate any\none or more of the following actions, whether\nor not such approval is required by Delaware\nlaw:\n                                              \n       the issuance of any series of          \n       preferred stock or preference stock    \n       ranking senior to the Series CC        \n       preferred stock                        \n  \u25cf    with respect to either the payment of  \n       dividends or the distribution of       \n       assets in the event of any voluntary   \n       or involuntary liquidation,            \n       dissolution or winding up;

The\nright of holders of our Series DD preferred\nstock to receive dividends is non-cumulative.\nThe Series DD preferred stock was issued on\nJuly 27, 2021 and the first dividend payment\ndate was\nSeptember 15, 2021.\n\nTo the extent we declare dividends on the\nSeries DD preferred stock and on any other\nParity Stock but cannot\nmake full payment of those declared dividends,\nwe will allocate the dividend payments on a\nproportional basis among the holders of shares\nof Series DD preferred stock and the holders\nof any Parity Stock then outstanding where the\nterms of such\nParity Stock provide similar dividend rights.\nNo interest will be payable in respect of any\ndividend payment that may be in arrears.\n\nWe\ncannot pay dividends on our common stock or\nother securities ranking junior to the Series\nDD preferred stock or repurchase, redeem or\notherwise acquire for consideration shares of\nour common stock, other securities ranking\njunior to the Series DD\npreferred stock or Parity Stock, subject to\ncertain exceptions, unless the full dividends\nfor the then-current period on all outstanding\nshares of Series DD preferred stock have been\ndeclared and paid or declared and a sum\nsufficient for the payment\nof those dividends has been set aside.\n\nWe, at the option of our board of directors or\nany duly authorized committee of our board of\ndirectors, may redeem, subject to the prior\napproval of the FRB, the Series DD preferred\nstock, in whole or in part, on any dividend\npayment date on or after September 15, 2026.\nIn addition, within 90 days of our good faith\ndetermination that a\nRegulatory Capital Treatment Event (as such\nterm is defined in the certificate of\ndesignation for the Series DD preferred\nstock), we, at the option of our board of\ndirectors or any duly authorized committee of\nthe board of directors, may, subject to\napproval of the appropriate federal banking\nagency, redeem in whole, but not in part, the\nshares of Series DD preferred stock at the\ntime outstanding prior to September 15, 2026.\nAny redemption shall be at the redemption\nprice of $25,000 per\nshare plus an amount equal to any dividends\nthat have been declared but not paid to the\nredemption date without accumulation of any\nundeclared dividends.\n\nIn the event of our voluntary or involuntary\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up, the\nholders of our Series DD preferred stock are\nentitled to receive a liquidating distribution\nin the amount of $25,000 per share, plus an\namount equal to any dividends that have been\ndeclared but not yet paid, without\naccumulation of any undeclared dividends, to\nthe date of liquidation, out of\nour assets legally available for distribution\nto our stockholders, before any distribution\nis made to holders of our common stock or any\nsecurities ranking junior to the Series DD\npreferred stock and subject to the rights of\nthe holders of Parity\nStock or any of our stock ranking senior to\nthe Series DD preferred stock as to such\ndistribution and the rights of our depositors\nand other creditors.\n\nHolders of our Series DD preferred stock do\nnot have any voting rights and are not\nentitled to elect any directors, except as\nrequired by law\nand except for the voting rights provided for\nbelow.\n\n112\n\nWhenever dividends payable on any shares of\nSeries DD preferred stock or any class or\nseries of Voting Parity Stock (as such term is\ndefined in the certificate of designation for\nthe Series DD preferred stock) have not been\ndeclared and paid in an aggregate amount equal\nto, as to any class or series, at least six\nquarterly dividend periods or their\nequivalent, whether or not for consecutive\ndividend periods, the holders of our Series DD\npreferred stock, voting together as a class\nwith holders of Voting Parity Stock whose\nvoting rights are exercisable, will be\nentitled to vote for the election of two\nadditional directors of our board of directors\nat our next annual meeting of stockholders and\nat each subsequent meeting of stockholders, by\na plurality of votes cast ; providedthat our\nboard of directors shall at no time include\nmore than two such directors and including,\nfor purposes of this limitation, all directors\nthat the holders of any series of Voting\nParity Stock are entitled to elect pursuant to\nlike voting rights. Upon the vesting of such\nright of such holders, the maximum authorized\nnumber of members of our board of directors\nshall automatically be increased by two and\nthe two vacancies so created shall be filled\nby vote of the holders of the outstanding\nSeries DD preferred stock (together with the\nholders of shares of any one or more other\nseries of Voting Parity Stock). At elections\nfor such directors, each holder of Series DD\npreferred stock shall be entitled to 25 votes\nfor each share held (the holders of shares of\nany other series of Voting Parity Stock being\nentitled to such number of votes, if any, for\neach share of such stock as may be granted to\nthem). The right of the holders of the Series\nDD preferred stock (voting together as a class\nwith the holders of shares of any one or more\nother series of Voting Parity Stock) to elect\nsuch directors shall continue until such time\nas we have paid in full dividends for the\nequivalent of at least four quarterly dividend\nperiods or their equivalent, at which time\nsuch right with respect to the Series DD\npreferred stock shall terminate, except as\nprovided by law, and subject to revesting in\nthe event of each and every subsequent\nnonpayment of dividends. Upon any termination\nof the right of the holders of all shares of\nSeries DD preferred stock and Voting Parity\nStock to vote for directors, the term of\noffice of all such directors then in office\nelected by only those holders voting as a\nclass shall terminate immediately. Whenever\nthe term of office of the directors elected by\nsuch holders voting as a class shall end and\nthe special voting powers vested in such\nholders shall have expired, the number of\ndirectors shall be such number as may be\nprovided for in our by-laws. In addition to\nany other vote required by law or our restated\ncertificate of incorporation, as amended, so\nlong as any shares of our Series DD preferred\nstock are outstanding, the vote or consent of\nthe holders of the outstanding shares of our\nSeries DD preferred stock and outstanding\nshares of all other series of Voting Parity\nStock entitled to vote on the matter, by a\nvote of at least 66 2/ 3% in voting power of\nall such outstanding Series DD preferred stock\nand such Voting Parity Stock, voting together\nas a class, given in person or by proxy,\neither in writing without a meeting or at any\nmeeting called for the purpose, will be\nnecessary to permit, effect or validate any\none or more of the following actions, whether\nor not such approval is required by Delaware\nlaw:\n                                              \n       the issuance of any series of          \n       preferred stock or preference stock    \n       ranking senior to the Series DD        \n       preferred stock                        \n  \u25cf    with respect to either the payment of  \n       dividends or the distribution of       \n       assets in the event of any voluntary   \n       or involuntary liquidation,            \n       dissolution or winding up;             \n                                              \n                                              \n       any amendment, alteration or repeal    \n       of any provision of our restated       \n       certificate of incorporation, as       \n       amended                                \n       (including the certificate of          \n  \u25cf    designation relating to the Series\u00a0DD  \n       preferred stock) or our by-laws that   \n       would adversely affect the rights,     \n       preferences, privileges or voting      \n       powers of the Series DD                \n       preferred stock;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       any amendment or alteration of our     \n       restated certificate of                \n       incorporation, as amended, or by-laws  \n       to authorize, create or increase the   \n       authorized amount of, any shares of,   \n       or any securities convertible into     \n  \u25cf    shares of, any class or series of our  \n       capital stock ranking senior to the    \n       Series DD preferred                    \n       stock with respect to either payment   \n       of dividends or the distribution of    \n       assets in the event of any voluntary   \n       or involuntary liquidation,            \n       dissolution or winding up; or          \n                                              \n113\n                                              \n       the consummation of a                  \n       reclassification involving the Series  \n       DD preferred stock or a merger or      \n       consolidation with                     \n       another corporation or other entity,   \n       except holders of the Series DD        \n       preferred stock will have no right to  \n       vote under this provision if in each   \n       case (i)\u00a0the shares of Series DD       \n       preferred stock remain outstanding     \n       or, in the case of any such            \n       merger or consolidation with respect   \n       to which we are not the surviving or   \n       resulting entity, are converted into   \n  \u25cf    or exchanged for preference            \n       securities of the surviving or         \n       resulting entity or its ultimate       \n       parent, and (ii)\u00a0such shares of        \n       Series DD                              \n       preferred stock remaining outstanding  \n       or such preference securities, as the  \n       case may be, have such rights,         \n       preferences, privileges and voting     \n       powers, taken as a whole, as are not   \n       materially less favorable to the       \n       holders thereof than the rights,       \n       preferences, privileges and voting     \n       powers of the Series DD preferred      \n       stock, taken as a whole;               \n                                              \nprovided, however, that any authorization,\ncreation or increase in the authorized amount\nof or issuance of our Series DD preferred\nstock or any class or series of Parity Stock\nor securities ranking junior to the Series DD\npreferred stock or any securities convertible\ninto any class or series of Parity Stock\n(whether dividends payable in respect of such\nParity Stock are cumulative or non-\ncumulative)or securities ranking junior to the\nSeries DD preferred stock will be deemed not\nto adversely affect the rights, preferences,\nprivileges or voting powers of the Series DD\npreferred stock, and holders of the Series DD\npreferred stock shall have no right to vote\nthereon. If an amendment, alteration, repeal,\nreclassification, merger or consolidation\ndescribed above would adversely affect one or\nmore but not all series of voting preferred\nstock (including the Series DD preferred stock\nfor this purpose), then only those series\naffected and entitled to vote shall vote as a\nclass in lieu of all such series of preferred\nstock. Each holder of the Series DD preferred\nstock will have 25 votes per share on any\nmatter on which holders of the Series DD\npreferred stock are entitled to vote, whether\nseparately or together with any other series\nof our stock (the holders of any shares of any\nother series of stock being entitled to such\nnumber of votes, if any, for each share of\nstock as may be granted to them), pursuant to\nDelaware law or otherwise, including by\nwritten consent. Series DD Depositary\nShares.Each Series DD depositary share issued\nby us represents a 1/1,000th interest in one\nshare of our Series DD preferred stock. The\nshares of our Series DD preferred stock are\ndeposited with Equiniti Trust Company, as\ndepositary. Pursuant to the deposit agreement,\nthe depositary issued Series DD depositary\nshares, which are evidenced by depositary\nreceipts. Equiniti Trust Company acts as\ntransfer agent and registrar and paying agent\nwith respect to the Series DD depositary\nshares. The depositary\u0092s office at which the\ndepositary receipts are administered is\nlocated at Equiniti Trust Company, 1110 Centre\nPointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota Heights, MN\n55120. The Series DD depositary shares were\nissued in book-entry form through DTC. This\nmeans that actual depositary receipts will not\nbe issued, except in limited circumstances.\nThis means that the Series DD depositary\nshares will be in the form of a single global\ndepositary receipt deposited with a DTC\nnominee. Each beneficial holder must rely on\nthe procedures of DTC and if the Series DD\ndepositary shares are held through a broker or\nfinancial institution nominee, the beneficial\nholder must rely on the procedures of such\nbroker or financial institution to assert the\nrights of a depositary receipt holder\ndescribed in this section. The depositary will\ndistribute all cash dividends or other cash\ndistributions received on the Series DD\npreferred stock to the holders of record of\nSeries DD depositary shares in proportion to\nthe numbers of such depositary shares owned by\neach holder. In the event of a distribution\nother than in cash, the depositary will\ndistribute property received by it to the\nholders of record of the Series DD depositary\nshares in proportion to the 114\n\nnumber of Series DD depositary shares held by\neach holder, unless the depositary determines\nthat it is not feasible to make such\ndistribution, in which case the depositary\nmay, with our approval,\nadopt a method of distribution that it deems\npracticable, including the sale of such\nproperty and distribution of the net proceeds\nfrom such sale to such holders.\n\nRecord dates for the payment of dividends and\nother matters relating to the Series DD\ndepositary shares are the same as the\ncorresponding\nrecord dates for the Series DD preferred\nstock.\n\nThe amounts distributed to holders of the\nSeries DD depositary shares will be reduced by\nany amounts required to be withheld by the\ndepositary or by us on account of taxes or\nother governmental charges.\n\nIf the Series DD\npreferred stock underlying the Series DD\ndepositary shares is redeemed (i) after\nSeptember 15, 2026, in whole or in part, or\n(ii) prior to September 15, 2026, in whole,\nbut not in part, due to the occurrence of a\nRegulatory\nCapital Treatment Event, Series DD depositary\nshares will be redeemed with the proceeds\nreceived by the depositary from the redemption\nof the Series DD preferred stock held by the\ndepositary. The redemption price per Series DD\ndepositary share will\nbe equal to 1/1,000th of the applicable\nredemption price per share payable with\nrespect to such Series DD preferred stock (or\n$25 per Series DD depositary share), plus an\namount equal to any declared and unpaid\ndividends, without accumulation\nof any undeclared dividends. If less than all\nthe Series DD preferred stock is redeemed\nafter September 15, 2026, the Series DD\ndepositary shares to be redeemed will be\nselected pro rata, or in any other manner\nconsistent with the rules and\npolicies of the NYSE as the depositary may\ndetermine to be fair and equitable.\n\nWhen the depositary receives notice of any\nmeeting at\nwhich the holders of the Series DD preferred\nstock are entitled to vote, the depositary\nwill mail, or otherwise transmit by an\nauthorized method, the information contained\nin the notice and any accompanying proxy\nmaterial to the record holders of\nthe Series DD depositary shares relating to\nthe Series DD preferred stock. Each record\nholder of the Series DD depositary shares on\nthe record date, which will be the same date\nas the record date for the Series DD preferred\nstock, may instruct the\ndepositary to vote the amount of the Series DD\npreferred stock represented by the holder\u0092s\nSeries DD depositary shares. To the extent\npossible, the depositary will vote the amount\nof the Series DD preferred stock represented\nby the Series DD\ndepositary shares in accordance with the\ninstructions it receives. We will agree to\ntake all reasonable actions that the\ndepositary determines are necessary to enable\nthe depositary to vote as instructed. If the\ndepositary does not receive specific\ninstructions from the holders of any Series DD\ndepositary shares representing the Series DD\npreferred stock, it will not vote the amount\nof Series DD preferred stock represented by\nsuch Series DD depositary shares.\n\n115\n\nDESCRIPTION OF DEPOSITARY SHARES\n\nThis section describes the general terms and\nprovisions of the depositary shares. The\nprospectus supplement will describe the\nspecific terms\nof the depositary shares offered through that\nprospectus supplement and any general terms\noutlined in this section that will not apply\nto those depositary shares.\n\nWe have summarized the material terms and\nprovisions of the deposit agreement, the\ndepositary shares and the depositary receipts\nin this\nsection. We have also filed the form of\ndeposit agreement, including the form of\ndepositary receipt, as an exhibit to the\nregistration statement of which this\nprospectus is a part. You should read the\nforms of deposit agreement and depositary\nreceipt relating to a series of preferred\nstock for additional information before you\nbuy any depositary shares that represent\npreferred stock of that series.\n\nGeneral\n\nWe may offer fractional\ninterests in preferred stock, rather than full\nshares of preferred stock. If we do, we will\nprovide for the issuance by a depositary to\nthe public of receipts for depositary shares,\neach of which will represent a fractional\ninterest in a share of a\nparticular series of preferred stock.\n\nThe shares of any series of preferred stock\nunderlying the depositary shares will be\ndeposited\nunder a separate deposit agreement between us\nand a bank or trust company having its\nprincipal office in the United States and\nhaving a combined capital and surplus of at\nleast $50 million, which we refer to in this\nsection as the\n\u0093.\u0094 We will name the depositary in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. Subject to\nthe terms of the deposit agreement, each owner\nof a depositary share will have a fractional\ninterest in all the rights and preferences of\nthe preferred stock underlying the depositary\nshare. Those rights include any dividend,\nvoting, redemption, conversion and liquidation\nrights.\n\nThe depositary shares will be evidenced by\ndepositary receipts issued under the deposit\nagreement. If you purchase fractional\ninterests in\nshares of the related series of preferred\nstock, you will receive depositary receipts as\ndescribed in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. While the final depositary\nreceipts are being prepared, we may order the\ndepositary to issue temporary\ndepositary receipts substantially identical to\nthe final depositary receipts although not in\nfinal form. The holders of the temporary\ndepositary receipts will be entitled to the\nsame rights as if they held the depositary\nreceipts in final form.\nHolders of the temporary depositary receipts\ncan exchange them for the final depositary\nreceipts at our expense.\n\nUnless we specify\notherwise in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, you will not be entitled to\nreceive the whole shares of preferred stock\nunderlying the depositary shares.\n\nDividends and Other Distributions\n\nThe\ndepositary will distribute all cash dividends\nor other cash distributions received with\nrespect to the preferred stock to the record\nholders of depositary shares representing the\nshares of preferred stock in proportion to the\nnumbers of depositary\nshares owned by the holders on the relevant\nrecord date. The depositary will not\ndistribute amounts less than one cent. The\ndepositary will distribute any balance with\nthe next sum received for distribution to\nrecord holders of depositary shares.\n\nIf there is a distribution other than in cash,\nthe depositary will distribute property to the\nholders of depositary shares, unless the\ndepositary determines that it is not feasible\nto make the distribution. If this occurs, the\ndepositary may, with our approval, sell the\nproperty and distribute the net proceeds from\nthe sale to the holders of depositary shares.\n\nThe deposit agreement will also contain\nprovisions relating to how any subscription or\nsimilar rights offered by us to holders of the\npreferred stock will be made available to the\nholders of depositary shares.\n\n116\n\nConversion and Exchange If any series of\npreferred stock underlying the depositary\nshares is subject to conversion or exchange,\nthe applicable prospectus supplement will\ndescribe the rights or obligations of each\nrecord holder of depositary receipts to\nconvert or exchange the depositary shares.\nRedemption of Depositary Shares If the series\nof the preferred stock underlying the\ndepositary shares is subject to redemption,\nall or a part of the depositary shares will be\nredeemed from the redemption proceeds of that\nseries of the preferred stock held by the\ndepositary. The depositary will mail notice of\nredemption between 30 to 60 days prior to the\ndate fixed for redemption to the record\nholders of the depositary shares to be\nredeemed at their addresses appearing in the\ndepositary\u0092s records. The redemption price per\ndepositary share will bear the same\nrelationship to the redemption price per share\nof preferred stock that the depositary share\nbears to the underlying preferred stock.\nWhenever we redeem preferred stock held by the\ndepositary, the depositary will redeem, as of\nthe same redemption date, the number of\ndepositary shares representing the preferred\nstock redeemed. If less than all the\ndepositary shares are to be redeemed, the\ndepositary shares to be redeemed will be\nselected by lottery or pro rata as determined\nby the depositary. After the date fixed for\nredemption, the depositary shares called for\nredemption will no longer be outstanding. When\nthe depositary shares are no longer\noutstanding, all rights of the holders will\ncease, except the right to receive money or\nother property that the holders of the\ndepositary shares were entitled to receive\nupon the redemption. Payments will be made\nwhen holders surrender their depositary\nreceipts to the depositary. Voting the\nPreferred Stock When the depositary receives\nnotice of any meeting at which the holders of\nthe preferred stock may vote, the depositary\nwill mail information about the meeting\ncontained in the notice, and any accompanying\nproxy materials, to the record holders of the\ndepositary shares relating to the preferred\nstock. Each record holder of such depositary\nshares on the record date, which will be the\nsame date as the record date for the preferred\nstock, will be entitled to instruct the\ndepositary as to how the preferred stock\nunderlying the holder\u0092s depositary shares\nshould be voted. The depositary will try, if\npractical, to vote the number of shares of\npreferred stock underlying the depositary\nshares according to the instructions received.\nWe will agree to take all action requested by\nand deemed necessary by the depositary in\norder to enable the depositary to vote the\npreferred stock in that manner. The depositary\nwill not vote any preferred stock for which it\ndoes not receive specific instructions from\nthe holders of the depositary shares relating\nto such preferred stock. Taxation Owners of\ndepositary shares will be treated for federal\nincome tax purposes as if they were owners of\nthe preferred stock represented by the\ndepositary shares.

A deposit agreement\nmay be terminated by us or the depositary only\nif:\n                                              \n       all outstanding depositary shares      \n  \u25cf    relating to the deposit agreement      \n       have been redeemed; or                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       there has been a final distribution    \n       on the preferred stock of the          \n       relevant series in connection with     \n       our                                    \n  \u25cf    liquidation, dissolution or winding    \n       up of our business and the             \n       distribution has been distributed to   \n       the holders of the related depositary  \n       shares.                                \n                                              \nCharges of Depositary We will pay all transfer\nand other taxes and governmental charges\narising solely from the existence of the\ndepositary arrangements. We will pay\nassociated charges of the depositary for the\ninitial deposit of the preferred stock and any\nredemption of the preferred stock. Holders of\ndepositary shares will pay transfer and other\ntaxes and governmental charges and any other\ncharges that are stated to be their\nresponsibility in the deposit agreement.\nMiscellaneous We will forward to the\ndepositary, for distribution to the holders of\ndepositary shares, all reports and\ncommunications that we must furnish to the\nholders of the preferred stock. Neither the\ndepositary nor we will be liable if the\ndepositary is prevented or delayed by law or\nany circumstance beyond its control in\nperforming its obligations under the deposit\nagreement. Our obligations and the\ndepositary\u0092s obligations under the deposit\nagreement will be limited to performance in\ngood faith of duties set forth in the deposit\nagreement. Neither the depositary nor we will\nbe obligated to prosecute or defend any legal\nproceeding connected with any depositary\nshares or preferred stock unless satisfactory\nindemnity is furnished to us and/or the\ndepositary. We and the depositary may rely\nupon written advice of counsel or accountants,\nor information provided by persons presenting\npreferred stock for deposit, holders of\ndepositary shares or other persons believed to\nbe competent and on documents believed to be\ngenuine. Resignation and Removal of Depositary\nThe depositary may resign at any time by\ndelivering notice to us. We may also remove\nthe depositary at any time. Resignations or\nremovals will take effect when a successor\ndepositary is appointed and it accepts the\nappointment.

If applicable, a\nprospectus supplement will describe the\nspecific terms of the common stock\noffered in connection with the conversion,\nexchange or exercise of debt securities,\npreferred stock, depositary shares or\nsecurities warrants and any general terms\noutlined in this section that will not apply\nto that common stock.\n\nWe have summarized the material terms and\nprovisions of the common stock in this\nsection. We have also filed our restated\ncertificate of\nincorporation, as amended, and our by-laws, as\namended, as exhibits to the registration\nstatement of which this prospectus is a part.\nYou should read our restated certificate of\nincorporation, as amended, and\nour by-laws, as amended, for additional\ninformation before you buy any securities\nwhich may be exercised or exchangeable for or\nconverted into common stock.\n\nGeneral\n\nShares Outstanding. As of September 30, 2022,\nour authorized common stock was 9,000,000,000\nshares. From these authorized shares, we had\nissued 5,481,811,474 shares, of which\n3,795,439,467 shares were outstanding and\n1,686,372,007\nshares were held as treasury shares.\n\nListing. Our common stock is listed on the New\nYork Stock Exchange under the\nsymbol \u0093WFC.\u0094 Equiniti Trust Company serves as\nthe transfer agent and registrar for the\ncommon stock.\n\nDividends. Holders of common stock may receive\ndividends if, when and as declared by our\nboard of directors out of our\nfunds that we can legally use to pay\ndividends. We may pay dividends in cash, stock\nor other property. In certain cases, holders\nof common stock may not receive dividends\nuntil we have satisfied our obligations to any\nholders of outstanding\npreferred stock. Other restrictions on our\nability to pay dividends are described below\nunder \u0093\u0097Restrictions on Payments of Dividends\u0094\nand above under \u0093Description of Preferred\nStock\u0097Outstanding Preferred Stock.\u0094\n\nVoting Rights. Holders of common stock have\nthe exclusive power to vote on all matters\npresented to our stockholders\nunless Delaware law or the certificate of\ndesignation for an outstanding series of\npreferred stock gives the holders of that\npreferred stock the right to vote on certain\nmatters. Each holder of common stock is\nentitled to one vote per share. Holders\nof common stock have no cumulative voting\nrights for the election of directors. This\nmeans a holder of a single share of common\nstock cannot cast more than one vote for each\nposition to be filled on our board of\ndirectors.\n\nOther Rights. If we voluntarily or\ninvoluntarily liquidate, dissolve or wind up\nour business, holders of common stock\nwill receive pro rata, according to shares\nheld by them, any of our remaining assets\navailable for distribution to stockholders\nafter we have provided for payment of all\ndebts and other liabilities, including any\nliquidation preference for\noutstanding shares of preferred stock. When we\nissue securities in the future, holders of\ncommon stock have no preemptive rights. This\nmeans the holders of common stock have no\nright, as holders of common stock, to buy any\nportion of those issued\nsecurities. Holders of our common stock have\nno rights to have their shares of common stock\nredeemed by us or to convert their shares of\ncommon stock into shares of any other class of\nour capital stock.\n\nFully Paid. The outstanding shares of common\nstock are fully paid and\nnon-assessable. This means the full purchase\nprice for the outstanding shares of common\nstock has been paid and the holders of such\nshares will not be assessed any additional\namounts for such shares. Any\nadditional common stock that we may issue in\nthe future upon the conversion or exercise of\nother securities offered under this prospectus\nwill also be fully paid and non-assessable.\n\n119\n\nRestrictions on Payment of Dividends\n\nWe are incorporated in Delaware and are\ngoverned by the General Corporation Law of the\nState of Delaware law allows a corporation to\npay\ndividends only out of surplus, as determined\nunder Delaware law, or, if there is no\nsurplus, out of net profits for the fiscal\nyear in which the dividend was declared and\nfor the preceding fiscal year. However, under\nDelaware law, we cannot pay\ndividends out of net profits if, after we pay\nthe dividend, our capital would be less than\nthe capital represented by the outstanding\nstock of all classes having a preference upon\nthe distribution of our assets.\n\nAs a bank holding company, our ability to pay\ndividends is affected by the ability of our\nbank and\nnon-bank subsidiaries to pay dividends to us.\nVarious federal laws limit the amount of\ndividends our national bank subsidiaries can\npay to us without regulatory approval. State-\nchartered banks are subject to\nstate regulations that limit dividends.\n\nThe terms of our outstanding junior\nsubordinated debt securities prohibit us from\ndeclaring or\npaying any dividends or distributions on our\ncapital stock, including our common stock, or\npurchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation\npayment on such stock, if an event of default\nhas occurred and is continuing under the\napplicable indenture, we\nare in default with respect to a guarantee\npayment under the guarantee of the related\ntrust preferred securities or we have given\nnotice of our election to defer interest\npayments but the related deferral period has\nnot yet commenced or a deferral\nperiod is continuing. In addition, the terms\nof each of our outstanding series of preferred\nstock prohibit us from declaring or paying any\ndividends or distributions on our common stock\nunless all accrued and unpaid dividends for\nall completed\ndividend periods with respect to that\npreferred stock have been paid.\n\nAnti-takeover Provisions Contained in the\nCertificate of Incorporation and By-laws\n\nCertain provisions of Delaware law could make\nit more difficult for a third party to\nacquire control of us or have the effect of\ndiscouraging a third party from attempting to\nacquire control of us. For example, we are\nsubject to Section 203 of the General\nCorporation Law of the State of Delaware,\nwhich would make it more\ndifficult for another party to acquire us\nwithout the approval of our board of\ndirectors. Certain provisions of our restated\ncertificate of incorporation, as amended, may\nmake it less likely that our management would\nbe changed or someone would\nacquire voting control of our company without\nour board\u0092s consent. These provisions may\ndelay, deter or prevent tender offers or\ntakeover attempts that stockholders may\nbelieve are in their best interests, including\ntender offers or attempts\nthat might allow stockholders to receive\npremiums over the market price of their common\nstock.\n\nPreferred Stock. Our\nboard of directors can at any time, under our\nrestated certificate of incorporation, as\namended, and without stockholder approval,\nissue one or more new series of preferred\nstock. In some cases, the issuance of\npreferred stock without stockholder\napproval could discourage or make more\ndifficult attempts to take control of our\ncompany through a merger, tender offer, proxy\ncontest or otherwise. Preferred stock with\nspecial voting rights or other features issued\nto persons favoring our\nmanagement could stop a takeover by preventing\nthe person trying to take control of our\ncompany from acquiring enough voting shares\nnecessary to take control.\n\nNomination Procedures. In addition to our\nboard of directors, stockholders can nominate\ncandidates for election to our\nboard of directors. However, a stockholder\nmust follow the advance notice procedures\ndescribed in Section 3.11 of our by-laws, as\namended. In general, a stockholder must\ndeliver a written notice of the\nnomination to our chief executive officer and\nour corporate secretary at least 90 days but\nnot more than 120 days prior to the first\nanniversary of the preceding year\u0092s annual\nmeeting for consideration at an annual meeting\nor, for consideration\nat a special meeting, at least 90 days but not\nmore than 120 days prior to the date of such\nmeeting or, if our first public announcement\nof the date of such special meeting is less\nthan 100 days prior to the date of such\nspecial meeting, then during\nthe 10 days following our public announcement.\nSubject to all of\n\n120\n\nthe terms and conditions specified in the by-\nlaws, an eligible stockholder (or a group of\nup to 20 eligible stockholders) who has\ncontinuously owned for\nthree years at least three percent of our\noutstanding shares may also nominate and\ninclude in our proxy materials nominees\nconstituting up to the greater of two\ndirectors and 20 percent of the board of\ndirectors. A stockholder must deliver\nwritten notice of the proxy access nomination\nto our corporate secretary at least 120 days\nprior to the first anniversary of the filing\ndate of our definitive proxy statement for the\npreceding year\u0092s annual meeting and no earlier\nthan 150 days\nprior to such date.\n\nProposal Procedures. Stockholders can propose\nthat business other than nominations to our\nboard of\ndirectors be considered at an annual meeting\nof stockholders only if a stockholder follows\nthe advance notice procedures described in our\nby-laws, as amended. In general, a stockholder\nmust submit a written\nnotice of the proposal and the stockholder\u0092s\ninterest in the proposal to our chief\nexecutive officer and our corporate secretary\nat least 90 days but not more than 120 days\nprior to the first anniversary of the\npreceding year\u0092s annual\nmeeting. Stockholders seeking to have a\nstockholder proposal considered for inclusion\nin our annual proxy statement must comply with\nthe requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the federal\nproxy rules.\n\nStockholder Requested Special Meetings. Our\nby-laws provide procedures pursuant to\nwhich record holders of not less than 20\npercent of the voting power of issued and\noutstanding shares of our common stock may\nrequest that the board of directors call a\nspecial meeting of stockholders. Our\nby-laws impose certain informational and\nprocedural requirements on stockholders\nrequesting such a meeting (including the\nprovision of the same information required by\nthe advance notice procedures described\nin Section 3.11 of our by-laws), as well as\nprovisions designed to avoid the calling of a\nspecial meeting to conduct the same or similar\nbusiness that was recently addressed or soon\nwill be addressed at\nanother stockholder meeting or that would be\nheld close in time to our annual meeting.\n\nAmendment of By-laws. Under our by-laws and\nrestated certificate of incorporation, as\namended, our board of directors can adopt,\namend or repeal the by-laws, subject to\nlimitations under the General Corporation Law\nof the State of Delaware or in the by-laws, as\namended. Under the General Corporation Law of\nthe State of\nDelaware, our stockholders also have the power\nto change or repeal our by-laws.\n\n121\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PURCHASE CONTRACTS This section\ndescribes the general terms and provisions of\nthe purchase contracts.

The unit\nagent will not so apply the principal payments\nif the holder has delivered cash to meet its\nobligations under the purchase contract. To\nsettle the purchase contract and receive the\npurchase contract property, the holder must\npresent and surrender the unit certificates at\nthe office of the unit agent. If a holder\nsettles its obligations under a purchase\ncontract that is part of a unit in cash rather\nthan by delivering the debt security that is\npart of the unit, that debt security will\nremain outstanding if the maturity extends\nbeyond the relevant settlement date and, as\nmore fully described in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, the holder will receive\nthat debt security or an interest in the\nrelevant global debt security. Pledge by\nPurchase Contract Holders to Secure\nPerformance.To secure the obligations of the\npurchase contract holders contained in the\nunit agreement and in the purchase contracts,\nthe holders, acting through the unit agent, as\ntheir attorney-in-fact,will grant, sell,\nconvey, assign, transfer and pledge the items\nin the following sentence, which we refer to\nas the \u0093 pledge,\u0094 to the collateral agent for\nour benefit. The pledge is a security interest\nin and to, and a lien upon and right of set-\noffagainst, all of the holders\u0092 right, title\nand interest in and to:\n                                              \n       any debt securities that are part of   \n       units that include the purchase        \n       contracts, or other property as may    \n  \u25cf    be                                     \n       specified in the applicable            \n       prospectus supplement, which we refer  \n       to as the \u0093pledged items\u0094;               \n                                              \n                                              \n       all additions to and substitutions     \n       for the pledged items as may be        \n  \u25cf    permissible, if so specified in the    \n       applicable                             \n       prospectus supplement;                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       all income, proceeds and collections   \n       received or to be received, or         \n       derived or to be derived, at any time  \n  \u25cf    from or                                \n       in connection with the pledged items   \n       described in the two clauses above;    \n       and                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n       all powers and rights owned or         \n  \u25cf    thereafter acquired under or with      \n       respect to the pledged items.          \n                                              \nThe pledge constitutes collateral security for\nthe performance when due by each holder of its\nobligations under the unit agreement and the\napplicable purchase contract. The collateral\nagent will forward all payments from the\npledged items to us, unless the payments have\nbeen released from the pledge in accordance\nwith the unit agreement. We will use the\npayments received from the pledged items to\nsatisfy the obligations of the holder of the\nunit under the related purchase contract.\nProperty Held in Trust by Unit Agent.If a\nholder fails to settle in cash its obligations\nunder a purchase contract that is part of a\nunit and fails to present and surrender its\nunit certificate to the unit agent when\nrequired, that holder will not receive the\npurchase contract property. Instead, the unit\nagent will hold that holder\u0092s purchase\ncontract property, together with any\ndistributions, as the registered owner in\ntrust for the benefit of the 123\n\nholder until the holder presents and\nsurrenders the certificate or provides\nsatisfactory evidence that the certificate has\nbeen destroyed, lost or stolen. We or the unit\nagent may require an indemnity from the holder\nfor liabilities related to any destroyed, lost\nor stolen certificate. If the holder does not\npresent the unit certificate, or provide the\nnecessary evidence of destruction or loss and\nindemnity, on or before the second anniversary\nof the settlement date of the related purchase\ncontract, the unit agent will pay to us the\namounts it received in trust for that holder.\nThereafter, the holder may recover those\namounts only from us and not the unit agent.\nThe unit agent will have no obligation to\ninvest or to pay interest on any amounts it\nholds in trust pending distribution. General\nTerms of Units We will issue the units under\none or more unit agreements, each referred to\nas a \u0093 unit agreement,\u0094 to be entered into\nbetween us and a bank or trust company, as\nunit agent.

A\nholder of securities warrant certificates may\nexchange them for new certificates of\ndifferent denominations, present them for\nregistration of transfer, and exercise them at\nthe corporate trust office of the securities\nwarrant agent or any other office indicated in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement. Until\nany securities warrants to purchase debt\nsecurities are exercised, the holder of such\nsecurities warrants will not have any of the\nrights of holders of the debt securities that\ncan be purchased upon exercise, including any\nright to receive payments of principal,\npremium or interest on the underlying debt\nsecurities or to enforce covenants in the\napplicable indenture. Until any securities\nwarrants to purchase preferred 129\n\nstock, depositary shares or common stock are\nexercised, holders of such securities warrants\nwill not have any rights of holders of the\nunderlying preferred stock, depositary shares\nor common stock, including any right to\nreceive dividends or to exercise any voting\nrights. Exercise of Securities Warrants Each\nholder of a securities warrant is entitled to\npurchase the principal amount of debt\nsecurities or number of shares of preferred\nstock, depositary shares or shares of common\nstock, as the case may be, at the exercise\nprice described in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. After the close of business on the\nday when the right to exercise terminates, or\na later date if we extend the time for\nexercise, unexercised securities warrants will\nbecome void. A holder of securities warrants\nmay exercise them by following the general\nprocedure outlined below:\n                                              \n       delivering to the securities warrant   \n  \u25cf    agent the payment required by the      \n       applicable prospectus supplement to    \n       purchase the underlying security;      \n                                              \n                                              \n       properly completing and signing the    \n  \u25cf    reverse side of the securities         \n       warrant certificate representing the   \n       securities warrants; and               \n                                              \n                                              \n       delivering the securities warrant      \n       certificate representing the           \n       securities warrants to the securities  \n       warrant                                \n  \u25cf    agent, or other office indicated in    \n       the applicable prospectus supplement,  \n       within five business days of the       \n       securities warrant agent receiving     \n       payment of the exercise price.         \n                                              \nIf you comply with the procedures described\nabove, your securities warrants will be\nconsidered to have been exercised when the\nsecurities warrant agent receives payment of\nthe exercise price. After you have completed\nthose procedures, we will, as soon as\npracticable, issue and deliver to you the debt\nsecurities, preferred stock, depositary shares\nor common stock that you purchased upon\nexercise. If you exercise fewer than all of\nthe securities warrants represented by a\nsecurities warrant certificate, the securities\nwarrant agent will issue to you a new\nsecurities warrant certificate for the\nunexercised amount of securities warrants.\nHolders of securities warrants will be\nrequired to pay any tax or governmental charge\nthat may be imposed in connection with\ntransferring the underlying securities in\nconnection with the exercise of the securities\nwarrants. Amendments and Supplements to\nSecurities Warrant Agreements We may amend or\nsupplement a securities warrant agreement\nwithout the consent of the holders of the\napplicable securities warrants if the changes\nare not inconsistent with the provisions of\nthe securities warrants and do not materially\nadversely affect the interests of the holders\nof the securities warrants. We, along with the\nsecurities warrant agent, may also modify or\namend a securities warrant agreement and the\nterms of the securities warrants if a majority\nof the then-outstanding unexercised securities\nwarrants affected by the modification or\namendment consent. However, no modification or\namendment that accelerates the expiration\ndate, increases the exercise price, reduces\nthe majority consent requirement for any such\nmodification or amendment, or otherwise\nmaterially adversely affects the rights of the\nholders of the securities warrants may be made\nwithout the consent of each holder affected by\nthe modification or amendment. Common Stock\nWarrant Adjustments Unless the applicable\nprospectus supplement states otherwise, the\nexercise price of, and the number of shares of\ncommon stock covered by, a warrant for common\nstock will be adjusted in the manner set forth\nin the applicable prospectus supplement if\ncertain events occur, including:\n                                              \n       if we issue capital stock as a         \n  \u25cf    dividend or distribution on the        \n       common stock;                          \n                                              \n130\n                                              \n  \u25cf    if we subdivide, reclassify or         \n       combine the common stock;              \n                                              \n                                              \n       if we issue rights or warrants to all  \n       holders of common stock entitling      \n       them, for a period expiring 45 days    \n       after                                  \n       the date fixed for determining the     \n  \u25cf    stockholders entitled to receive such  \n       rights or warrants, to purchase        \n       common stock at less than the current  \n       market price, as defined in the        \n       warrant agreement for such series of   \n       common stock warrants; or              \n                                              \n                                              \n       if we distribute to all holders of     \n       common stock evidences of our          \n       indebtedness or our assets, excluding  \n       certain                                \n  \u25cf    cash dividends and distributions, or   \n       if we distribute to all holders of     \n       common stock rights or warrants,       \n       excluding those referred to in the     \n       bullet point above.                    \n                                              \nExcept as stated above, the exercise price and\nnumber of shares of common stock covered by a\ncommon stock warrant will not be adjusted if\nwe issue common stock or any securities\nconvertible into or exchangeable for common\nstock, or securities carrying the right to\npurchase common stock or securities\nconvertible into or exchangeable for common\nstock. Holders of common stock warrants may\nhave additional rights under the following\ncircumstances:\n                                              \n  \u25cf    a reclassification or change of the    \n       common stock;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25cf    a consolidation or merger involving    \n       our company; or                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       a sale or conveyance to another        \n  \u25cf    corporation of all or substantially    \n       all of our property and assets.        \n                                              \nIf one of the above transactions occurs and\nholders of our common stock are entitled to\nreceive stock, securities, other property or\nassets, including cash, with respect to or in\nexchange for common stock, the holders of the\ncommon stock warrants then outstanding will be\nentitled to receive upon exercise of their\ncommon stock warrants the kind and amount of\nshares of stock and other securities or\nproperty that they would have received upon\nthe reclassification, change, consolidation,\nmerger, sale or conveyance if they had\nexercised their common stock warrants\nimmediately before the transaction. 131\n\nBENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR CONSIDERATIONS Each\nfiduciary of a pension, profit-sharing or\nother employee benefit plan to which Title I\nof the Employee Retirement Income Security Act\nof 1974, as amended (\u0093 ERISA\u0094), applies (a \u0093\nplan\u0094) should consider the fiduciary standards\nof ERISA in the context of the plan\u0092s\nparticular circumstances before authorizing an\ninvestment in the offered securities.\nAccordingly, among other factors, the\nfiduciary should consider whether the\ninvestment would satisfy the prudence and\ndiversification requirements of ERISA and\nwould be consistent with the documents and\ninstruments governing the plan. When we use\nthe term \u0093 holder\u0094 in this section, we are\nreferring to a beneficial owner of the offered\nsecurities and not the record holder. Section\n406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code\nprohibit plans, as well as individual\nretirement accounts and Keogh plans to which\nSection 4975 of the Code applies (also \u0093\nplans\u0094), from engaging in specified\ntransactions involving \u0093plan assets\u0094 with\npersons who are \u0093parties in interest\u0094 under\nERISA or \u0093disqualified persons\u0094 under the Code\n(collectively, \u0093 parties in interest\u0094) with\nrespect to such plan. A violation of those\n\u0093prohibited transaction\u0094 rules may result in\nan excise tax or other liabilities under ERISA\nand/or Section 4975 of the Code for such\npersons, unless statutory or administrative\nexemptive relief is available. Therefore, a\nfiduciary of a plan should also consider\nwhether an investment in the offered\nsecurities might constitute or give rise to a\nprohibited transaction under ERISA and the\nCode. Employee benefit plans that are\ngovernmental plans, as defined in Section\n3(32) of ERISA, certain church plans, as\ndefined in Section 3(33) of ERISA, and\nnon-U.S.plans, as described in Section 4(b)(4)\nof ERISA, are not subject to the requirements\nof ERISA, or Section 4975 of the Code, but may\nbe subject to other legal restrictions (\u0093\nsimilar laws\u0094). Because of our business, we\nand our affiliates may each be considered a\nparty in interest with respect to many plans.\nSpecial caution should be exercised,\ntherefore, before the offered securities are\npurchased by a plan. In particular, the\nfiduciary of the plan should consider whether\nstatutory or administrative exemptive relief\nis available under an applicable statutory or\nadministrative exemption. The U.S. Department\nof Labor has issued five prohibited\ntransaction class exemptions (\u0093 PTCEs\u0094) that\nmay provide exemptive relief for direct or\nindirect prohibited transactions resulting\nfrom the purchase or holding of the offered\nsecurities. Those class exemptions are:\n                                              \n       PTCE 96-23, for specified              \n  \u25cf    transactions determined by in-house    \n       asset managers;                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       PTCE 95-60, for specified              \n  \u25cf    transactions involving insurance       \n       company                                \n       general accounts;                      \n                                              \n                                              \n       PTCE 91-38, for specified              \n  \u25cf    transactions involving bank            \n       collective                             \n       investment funds;                      \n                                              \n                                              \n       PTCE 90-1, for specified transactions  \n  \u25cf    involving insurance company            \n       separate accounts; and                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       PTCE 84-14, for specified              \n       transactions determined by             \n  \u25cf    independent                            \n       qualified professional asset           \n       managers.                              \n                                              \nIn addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and\nSection 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide an\nexemption for transactions between a plan and\na person who is a party in interest (other\nthan a fiduciary who has or exercises any\ndiscretionary authority or control with\nrespect to investment of the plan assets\ninvolved in the transaction or renders\ninvestment advice with respect thereto) solely\nby reason of providing services to the plan\n(or by reason of a relationship to such a\nservice provider), if in connection with the\ntransaction the plan receives no less and pays\nno more, than \u0093adequate consideration\u0094 (within\nthe meaning of Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA).\nThere can be no assurance that any of these\nstatutory or class exemptions will be\navailable with respect to transactions\ninvolving the notes. 132\n\nThe foregoing list of exemptions is not\nexhaustive.

When we use the\nterm \u0093 holder\u0094 in this section, we are\nreferring to a beneficial holder of the debt\nsecurities, common stock or preferred stock.\nAs used herein, a \u0093 U.S. Holder\u0094 is a\nbeneficial owner of debt securities or shares\nof common or preferred stock, as the case may\nbe, that is, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, (i) an individual citizen or\nresident of the United States, (ii) a\ncorporation (or any other entity treated as a\ncorporation for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes) created or organized in or under the\nlaws of the United States, any state thereof\nor the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate\nwhose income is subject to U.S. federal income\ntax regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust\nif (A) a United States court has the authority\nto exercise primary supervision over the\nadministration of the trust and one or more\nU.S. persons (as defined under the Code) are\nauthorized to control all substantial\ndecisions of the trust or (B) it has a valid\nelection in place to be treated as a U.S.\nperson. An individual who is neither a U.S.\ncitizen nor a U.S. permanent resident may,\nsubject to certain exceptions, be deemed to be\na resident of the United States by reason of\nbeing present in the United States for at\nleast 31 days in the calendar year and for an\naggregate of at least 183 days during a three-\nyear period ending in the current calendar\nyear (counting for such purposes all of the\ndays present in the current year, one-thirdof\nthe days present in the immediately preceding\nyear and one-sixthof the days present in the\nsecond preceding year). A \u0093 Non-U.S.Holder\u0094 is\nany beneficial owner of a debt security or\nshares of common or preferred stock, as the\ncase may be, that, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, is not a U.S. Holder and that is not\na partnership (or other entity treated as a\npartnership for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes). If a partnership (or other entity\ntreated as a partnership for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes) holds debt securities or\nshares of common or preferred stock, the U.S.\nfederal income tax treatment of a partner will\ngenerally depend on the status of the partner\nand the activities of the partnership. A\npartnership holding debt securities or shares\nof common or preferred stock, and partners in\nsuch a partnership, should consult their own\ntax advisors with regard to the U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences of the purchase,\nownership and disposition of the debt\nsecurities or shares of common or preferred\nstock by the partnership. THE DISCUSSION OF\nTHE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX\nCONSIDERATIONS OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND\nDISPOSITION OF THE DEBT SECURITIES, COMMON\nSTOCK AND PREFERRED STOCK IS NOT INTENDED TO\nBE, NOR SHOULD IT BE CONSTRUED TO BE, LEGAL OR\nTAX ADVICE TO ANY PARTICULAR PERSON.\nACCORDINGLY, ALL PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE\nURGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH\nRESPECT TO THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL\nAND NON-U.S.TAX CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE\nPURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE\nDEBT SECURITIES, COMMON STOCK OR PREFERRED\nSTOCK BASED ON THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.\nU.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders\nThe following is a summary of the material\nU.S. federal income tax considerations that\nwill apply to U.S. Holders. 135\n\nDebt Securities\n\nPayments of Interest. Except as set forth\nbelow, interest on debt securities generally\nwill be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary\ninterest income from domestic sources at the\ntime that such interest is paid or accrued in\naccordance with the U.S. Holder\u0092s regular\nmethod of accounting for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes.\n\nOriginal Issue Discount. Special tax\naccounting rules apply to debt securities\nissued with \u0093original issue discount\u0094\n(\u0093\u0094) for U.S. federal income tax purposes\n(\u0093\u0094). In general, debt securities will be\ntreated as issued with OID if the \u0093issue\nprice\u0094 of the debt securities is less than\ntheir\n\u0093stated redemption price at maturity\u0094 unless\nthe amount of such difference is de minimis\n(less than 0.25% of the stated redemption\nprice at maturity multiplied by the number of\ncomplete years to maturity). Regardless of the\nregular\nmethod of accounting used by a U.S. Holder for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes, OID\ngenerally must be accrued into gross income on\na constant yield basis, in advance of the\nreceipt of some or all of the cash\nattributable to such OID.\n\nThe \u0093\u0094 of debt securities will be the initial\noffering price to the public at which a\nsubstantial amount of the\ndebt securities is sold for cash (ignoring\nsales to bond houses, brokers or similar\npersons or organizations acting in the\ncapacity of underwriters, placement agents or\nwholesalers). The \u0093\u0094 of debt\nsecurities is the sum of all payments to be\nmade on the debt securities other than\n\u0093qualified stated interest\u0094 payments. A \u0093\u0094\npayment is stated interest that is\nunconditionally payable at least\nannually at a single fixed rate (appropriately\ntaking into account the length of the interval\nbetween payments).\n\nFor OID debt securities\nhaving a term of more than one year, the\namount of OID includible in gross income by a\nU.S. Holder of the OID debt securities is the\nsum of the \u0093daily portions\u0094 of OID with\nrespect to the OID debt securities for each\nday during the taxable\nyear in which such U.S. Holder held the OID\ndebt securities. The daily portion is\ndetermined by allocating to each day in any\n\u0093accrual period\u0094 a pro rata portion of the OID\nallocable to such accrual period.\n\nThe amount of OID allocable to any accrual\nperiod is generally equal to the excess (if\nany) of (i) the product of the \u0093adjusted\nissue price\u0094 of the OID debt securities at the\nbeginning of such accrual period and the yield\nto maturity of the OID debt securities, as\ndetermined on the basis of compounding at the\nclose of each accrual period and properly\nadjusted for the\nlength of the accrual period, over (ii) the\nsum of any qualified stated interest payments\nallocable to the accrual period. For this\npurpose, accrual periods may be of any length\nand may vary in length over the term of the\nOID debt securities\nprovided that each accrual period is no longer\nthan one year and each scheduled payment of\nprincipal or interest occurs at the beginning\nor the end of an accrual period.\n\nThe adjusted issue price of OID debt\nsecurities at the start of any accrual period\nis generally equal to the issue price,\nincreased by the\naccrued OID for each prior accrual period, and\nreduced by certain prior payments with respect\nto the OID debt securities that were not\nqualified stated interest payments.\n\nUnder the constant yield method for accruing\nOID, a U.S. Holder generally will have to\ninclude in gross income increasingly greater\namounts\nof OID in successive accrual periods.\n\nDebt securities may contain provisions\nallowing the debt securities to be redeemed\nprior to their\nstated maturity date at our option or at the\noption of holders. For purposes of determining\nyield and maturity, debt securities that may\nbe redeemed prior to their stated maturity\ndate at the option of the issuer generally\nwill be treated from the\ntime of issuance as having a maturity date for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes on such\nredemption date if such redemption would\nresult in a lower yield to maturity.\nConversely, debt securities that may be\nredeemed prior to their stated maturity\ndate at the option of the holder generally\nwill be treated from the time of issuance as\nhaving a maturity date for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes on such redemption date if such\n\n136\n\nredemption would result in a higher yield to\nmaturity. If the exercise of such an option\ndoes not occur, contrary to the assumptions\nmade as of the issue date, then solely for\npurposes of the\naccrual of OID, the debt securities will be\ntreated as reissued on the date of the change\nin circumstances for an amount equal to their\nadjusted issue price.\n\nWe are required to report to the IRS the\namount of OID accrued in respect of OID debt\nsecurities held by persons other than exempt\nholders.\n\nShort-Term Debt Securities. In the case of\ndebt securities that have a fixed maturity of\none year or less (\u0093\u0094), all payments, including\nall payments of stated interest, will be\nincluded in the stated redemption price at\nmaturity. The short-term debt securities will\nbe treated for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes as having been\nissued with OID in the amount of the\ndifference between their issue price and\nstated redemption price at maturity. In\ngeneral, U.S. Holders that use the accrual\nmethod of accounting for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes and certain other U.S. Holders\nare required to accrue OID in respect of\nshort-term debt securities into gross income\neither on a ratable basis or, if a U.S. Holder\nso elects, on a constant yield basis using\ndaily compounding. U.S. Holders that are\nindividuals and certain other\nU.S. Holders that use the cash method of\naccounting for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes are not required to accrue OID on\nshort-term debt securities in advance of the\nreceipt of payment unless they elect to do so.\nIf such a U.S. Holder does not\nelect to accrue OID on short-term debt\nsecurities into gross income, then gain\nsubsequently recognized upon the sale,\nretirement or other disposition of the short-\nterm debt securities generally will be treated\nas ordinary interest income to the\nextent of the OID that has accrued through the\ndate of such disposition. Furthermore, a non-\nelecting U.S. Holder of short-term debt\nsecurities may be required to defer deductions\nfor a portion of the U.S.\nHolder\u0092s interest expense with respect to any\nindebtedness incurred or maintained to\npurchase or carry the short-term debt\nsecurities.\n\nVariable Rate Debt Securities. Treasury\nregulations prescribe special rules for\n\u0093variable rate debt instruments\u0094 that\nprovide for the payment of interest based on\ncertain floating or objective rates. In\ngeneral, debt securities will qualify as\nvariable rate debt instruments (\u0093\u0094) if (i) the\nissue price of the debt\nsecurities does not exceed the total non-\ncontingent principal payments due in respect\nof the debt securities by more than an amount\nequal to the lesser of (A) 0.015 multiplied by\nthe product of the total non-contingent\nprincipal payments and the number of complete\nyears to maturity from the issue date or (B)\n15% of the total non-contingent principal\npayments, and\n(ii) the debt securities provide for stated\ninterest, paid or compounded at least\nannually, at \u0093current values\u0094 of (A) one or\nmore \u0093qualified floating rates,\u0094 (B) a single\nfixed rate and one or more qualified\nfloating rates, (C) a single \u0093objective rate,\u0094\nor (D) a single fixed rate and a single\nobjective rate that is a \u0093qualified inverse\nfloating rate.\u0094 A current value of a rate is\nthe value of the rate on any date that is\nno earlier than three months prior to the\nfirst day on which that value is in effect and\nno later than one year following that first\nday.\n\nA \u0093\u0094 is any variable rate where variations in\nthe value of such rate can reasonably be\nexpected to\nmeasure contemporaneous variations in the cost\nof newly borrowed funds in the currency in\nwhich the variable rate debt securities are\ndenominated. Although a multiple of a\nqualified floating rate generally will not\nitself constitute a qualified\nfloating rate, a variable rate equal to the\nproduct of a qualified floating rate and a\nfixed multiple that is greater than 0.65 but\nnot more than 1.35 can constitute a qualified\nfloating rate. A variable rate equal to the\nproduct of a qualified\nfloating rate and a fixed multiple that is\ngreater than 0.65 but not more than 1.35,\nincreased or decreased by a fixed rate, will\nalso constitute a qualified floating rate. In\naddition, two or more qualified floating rates\nthat can reasonably be\nexpected to have approximately the same values\nthroughout the term of the variable rate debt\nsecurities (e.g., two or more qualified\nfloating rates with values within 25 basis\npoints of each other as determined on the\nissue date) will be\ntreated as a single qualified floating rate.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a variable rate\nthat would otherwise constitute a qualified\nfloating rate but which is subject to one or\nmore restrictions such as a maximum stated\ninterest rate\n(i.e., a cap), a minimum stated interest rate\n(i.e., a floor) or a restriction on the amount\nof increase or decrease in the stated interest\n(i.e., a governor) may, under certain\ncircumstances, fail to be treated as a\nqualified\nfloating rate unless\n\n137\n\nsuch restrictions are fixed throughout the\nterm of the variable rate debt securities or\nare reasonably expected to not have a\nsignificant effect on the yield of the\nvariable rate debt securities.\n\nAn \u0093\u0094 is a rate that is not itself a qualified\nfloating rate but which is determined using a\nsingle fixed\nformula and that is based on objective\nfinancial or economic information. A rate will\nnot qualify as an objective rate if it is\nbased on information that is within the\ncontrol of the issuer (or a related party) or\nthat is unique to the circumstances\nof the issuer (or a related party), such as\ndividends, profits, or the value of the\nissuer\u0092s stock (although a rate does not fail\nto be an objective rate merely because it is\nbased on the credit quality of the issuer). An\nobjective rate is a\n\u0093qualified inverse floating rate\u0094 if the rate\nis equal to a fixed rate minus a qualified\nfloating rate, as long as variations in the\nrate can reasonably be expected to inversely\nreflect contemporaneous variations in the\nqualified floating\nrate. If debt securities provide for stated\ninterest at a fixed rate for an initial period\nof one year or less followed by a variable\nrate that is either a qualified floating rate\nor an objective rate and if the variable rate\non the issue date is\nintended to approximate the fixed rate (e.g.,\nthe value of the variable rate on the issue\ndate does not differ from the value of the\nfixed rate by more than 0.25%), then the fixed\nrate and the variable rate together will\nconstitute either a\nsingle qualified floating rate or objective\nrate, as the case may be.\n\nIf variable rate debt securities provide for\nstated interest at\neither a single qualified floating rate or a\nsingle objective rate throughout their term,\nand such interest is unconditionally payable\nin cash or property (other than debt\ninstruments of the issuer) at least annually,\nthen all stated interest on\nsuch variable rate debt securities will\nconstitute qualified stated interest that is\nincluded in gross income by U.S. Holders as\nreceived or accrued in accordance with their\nregular methods of accounting for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. Thus,\nsuch variable rate debt securities generally\nwill not be treated as having been issued with\nOID unless the variable rate securities are\nsold at a discount from their stated principal\namount, subject to a de minimis exception. In\ngeneral, the\namount of qualified stated interest and OID,\nif any, that accrues during an accrual period\non such variable rate debt securities is\ndetermined under the rules described above by\nassuming that the variable rate is a fixed\nrate equal to (i) in\nthe case of a qualified floating rate or\nqualified inverse floating rate, the value as\nof the issue date of the qualified floating\nrate or qualified inverse floating rate, or\n(ii) in the case of an objective rate (other\nthan a qualified inverse\nfloating rate), a fixed rate that reflects the\nyield that is reasonably expected for the\nvariable rate debt securities. The qualified\nstated interest allocable to an accrual period\nis increased (or decreased) if the interest\nactually paid during an\naccrual period exceeds (or is less than) the\ninterest that was accrued under the foregoing\napproach.\n\nFor other variable rate debt\nsecurities, the timing and amount of OID and\nqualified stated interest will be determined\nby converting the variable rate debt\nsecurities into \u0093equivalent fixed rate debt\ninstruments.\u0094 The conversion of the variable\nrate debt securities\ninto equivalent fixed rate debt instruments\ngenerally involves substituting for any\nqualified floating rate or qualified inverse\nfloating rate a fixed rate equal to the value\nof the qualified floating rate or qualified\ninverse floating rate, as the\ncase may be, as of the issue date, or\nsubstituting for any objective rate (other\nthan a qualified inverse floating rate) a\nfixed rate that reflects the yield that is\nreasonably expected for the variable rate debt\nsecurities. In the case of variable\nrate debt securities that provide for stated\ninterest at a fixed rate in addition to either\none or more qualified floating rates or a\nqualified inverse floating rate, the fixed\nrate is initially converted into a qualified\nfloating rate (or a\nqualified inverse floating rate, if the\nvariable rate debt securities provide for a\nqualified inverse floating rate). Under such\ncircumstances, the qualified floating rate or\nqualified inverse floating rate that replaces\nthe fixed rate must be such\nthat the fair market value of the variable\nrate debt securities as of their issue date is\napproximately the same as the fair market\nvalue of an otherwise identical debt\ninstrument that provides for either the\nqualified floating rate or qualified\ninverse floating rate rather than the fixed\nrate. Subsequent to converting the fixed rate\ninto either a qualified floating rate or a\nqualified inverse rate, the variable rate debt\nsecurities are then converted into equivalent\nfixed rate debt\ninstruments in the manner described above.\n\nOnce the variable rate debt securities are\nconverted into equivalent fixed rate debt\ninstruments pursuant to the foregoing rules,\nthe timing and amount of OID and qualified\nstated interest, if any, are determined\n\n138\n\nfor the equivalent fixed rate debt instruments\nby applying the general OID rules to the\nequivalent fixed rate debt instruments. A U.S.\nHolder of such variable rate debt securities\nwill account\nfor OID and qualified stated interest as if\nthe U.S. Holder held the equivalent fixed rate\ndebt instruments. For each accrual period,\nappropriate adjustments will be made to the\namount of qualified stated interest or OID\nassumed to have been accrued\nor paid with respect to the equivalent fixed\nrate debt instruments in the event that such\namounts differ from the actual amount of\ninterest accrued or paid on the variable rate\ndebt securities during the accrual period.\n\nA modification, under applicable Treasury\nRegulations, means any alteration, including\nany deletion or addition, in whole or in part,\nof a\nlegal right or obligation of the issuer or a\nholder of a debt instrument, whether the\nalteration is evidenced by an express\nagreement (oral or written), conduct of the\nparties, or otherwise. The designation of a\nBenchmark Replacement or Non-USD Benchmark\nReplacement, as applicable, could result in a\n\u0093significant modification\u0094 of variable rate\ndebt securities. Under applicable Treasury\nregulations, the modification of a debt\ninstrument is\na \u0093significant\u0094 modification (i.e., a\nmodification upon which gain or loss is\nrealized) if, based on all the facts and\ncircumstances and taking into account all\nmodifications of the debt instrument\ncollectively (other than certain\nenumerated types of modifications), the legal\nrights or obligations that are altered and the\ndegree to which they are altered are\n\u0093economically significant.\u0094\n\nA significant modification would generally\nresult in the variable rate debt securities\nbeing treated as terminated and reissued for\nU.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. Such a deemed\nexchange could at the time be considered a\nrecapitalization for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, in which case a holder generally\nwould not recognize any gain or loss (except\nto the extent that new debt\nsecurities are deemed issued in exchange for\naccrued and unpaid interest). If such a deemed\nexchange was not considered a recapitalization\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes, a holder\nmight be required to recognize gain or loss\nwith respect to the\nvariable rate debt securities and income in\nrespect of accrued and unpaid interest, and\nthe holding period in the hands of the holder\nfor the variable rate debt securities could be\naffected. Any amount attributable to accrued\nand unpaid interest\nwould be taxed as ordinary interest income to\nthe extent not previously included in income\nby the holder. Depending on the facts at the\ntime of a Benchmark Replacement or Non-USD\nBenchmark Replacement, as\napplicable, resulting in the significant\nmodification, the reissued variable rate debt\nsecurities could be characterized for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes in a manner\ndifferent from their original treatment, which\ncould have a significant and\npotentially adverse effect on the timing and\ncharacter of income with respect to the\nvariable rate debt securities.\n\nYou should consult\nyour tax adviser regarding the tax\nconsequences of the designation of a Benchmark\nReplacement or Non-USD Benchmark Replacement,\nas applicable.\n\nContingent Payment Debt Securities.If debt\nsecurities provide for variable rates of\ninterest or other contingent payments but fail\nto\nqualify as variable rate debt securities under\nthe rules described above, then the debt\nsecurities may become subject to the Treasury\nregulations governing \u0093contingent payment debt\ninstruments\u0094 (\u0093\u0094). Under these Treasury\nregulations, a U.S. Holder of contingent\npayment debt securities generally would be\nrequired to accrue interest income each\ntaxable year based upon a \u0093comparable yield\u0094\nfor a hypothetical fixed\nrate debt instrument with no contingent\npayments but with terms and conditions\notherwise similar to the contingent payment\ndebt securities, but in any event not less\nthan the applicable Federal rate (based on the\noverall maturity of the debt\nsecurities). We would be required to determine\nthe comparable yield and prepare, solely for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes, a projected\npayment schedule that includes all non-\ncontingent payments and\nestimates of the amount and timing of all\ncontingent payments on the debt securities.\n\nIf the actual contingent payments made on the\ncontingent payment debt securities in a\ntaxable year differ from the projected\ncontingent payments set forth on the projected\npayment schedule, adjustments will be made for\nsuch differences. A net positive adjustment\nfor the amount by which actual\ncontingent payments during the taxable year\nexceed the projected contingent payments for\nsuch taxable year will be treated as\nadditional interest income. A net negative\nadjustment for the amount by which actual\ncontingent payments during the\n\n139\n\ntaxable year are less than the projected\ncontingent payments for such taxable year (i)\nfirst, will reduce the amount of interest\nrequired to be accrued in the current taxable\nyear,\n(ii) second, any negative adjustments that\nexceed the amount of interest accrued in the\ncurrent year will be treated as ordinary loss\nto the extent that the total interest\ninclusions previously accrued in respect of\nthe contingent payment debt\nsecurities exceed the total amount of net\nnegative adjustments treated as ordinary loss\nin prior taxable years, and (iii) third, any\nexcess adjustments will be treated as a\nregular negative adjustment in the succeeding\ntaxable year.\n\nUpon the sale, retirement or other disposition\nof contingent payment debt securities, any\ngain recognized by a U.S. Holder would be\ntreated\nas ordinary income. Any loss arising in such a\ndisposition would be treated as an ordinary\nloss to the extent that the holder\u0092s total\ninterest inclusions exceed the total amount of\nnet negative adjustments treated as ordinary\nloss. The balance\nof such loss generally would constitute a\ncapital loss.\n\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of any\ndebt securities that will be\ntreated as contingent payment debt securities\nsubject to these Treasury regulations will be\nmore fully described in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. The rules regarding\ncontingent payment debt securities are\ncomplex. U.S. Holders should\ncarefully examine the applicable prospectus\nsupplement for any such debt securities and\nshould consult their own tax advisors\nregarding the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences of the ownership and disposition\nof such debt securities before deciding\nto purchase such debt securities.\n\nMarket Discount.If a U.S. Holder purchases\ndebt securities (other than debt securities\npurchased at original issue at or above the\nissue price and other than short-term debt\nsecurities) for an amount that is less than\ntheir stated redemption price at maturity or,\nin the case of OID debt securities, their\nrevised issue price, the\namount of the difference will be treated as\n\u0093market discount\u0094 for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, unless that difference is less than\na specified de minimis amount. Under the\nmarket discount rules, a U.S. Holder generally\nwill be\nrequired to treat any payments received in\nrespect of the debt securities, other than\npayments of qualified stated interest, and any\ngain derived from the sale, retirement or\nother disposition of the debt securities, as\nordinary income to the extent\nof the market discount that has accrued on the\ndebt securities (on a ratable basis or, at the\nelection of the U.S. Holder, a constant yield\nbasis) but has not previously been included in\ngross income by the U.S. Holder. In addition,\na U.S. Holder\nmay be required to defer until the maturity of\nthe debt securities, or their earlier\ndisposition in a taxable transaction, the\ndeduction of all or a portion of any interest\nexpense incurred on indebtedness incurred to\npurchase or carry such debt\nsecurities.\n\nA U.S. Holder may elect to currently include\nmarket discount in gross income as it accrues,\nunder either a ratable or\nconstant yield method, in which case the rules\ndescribed above regarding characterization of\npayments and gain as ordinary income and the\ndeferral of interest deductions will not\napply. An election to currently include market\ndiscount in gross\nincome, once made, applies to all market\ndiscount obligations acquired by the U.S.\nHolder on or after the first taxable year to\nwhich the election applies and may not be\nrevoked without the consent of the IRS.\nProspective investors should consult\ntheir own tax advisors before making this\nelection.\n\nAcquisition Premium. If a U.S. Holder acquires\nOID debt securities for an\namount greater than their adjusted issue price\nbut less than the sum of all amounts (other\nthan qualified stated interest) payable with\nrespect to the OID debt securities after the\ndate of acquisition, the excess is an\n\u0093acquisition\npremium.\u0094 For OID debt securities acquired\nwith acquisition premium, the amount of OID\nthat the U.S. Holder must include in gross\nincome with respect to the OID debt securities\nfor any taxable year will be reduced by the\nportion of acquisition\npremium properly allocable to such taxable\nyear. The amount of acquisition premium\nallocated to each period is determined by\nmultiplying the OID that otherwise would have\nbeen included in income by a fraction, the\nnumerator of which is the excess of\nthe cost of the OID debt security over the\nadjusted issue price of the OID debt security\nand the denominator of which is the excess of\nthe OID debt security\u0092s stated redemption\nprice at maturity over its adjusted issue\nprice.\n\nAmortizable Bond Premium. If a U.S. Holder\npurchases debt securities for an amount in\nexcess of the sum of all amounts payable on\nthe\ndebt securities after the purchase date other\nthan payments of qualified\n\n140\n\nstated interest, the U.S. Holder will be\nconsidered to have purchased the debt\nsecurities at a \u0093premium\u0094 for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. In such case, the U.S.\nHolder generally\nmay elect to amortize the premium over the\nremaining term of the debt securities, on a\nconstant yield method, as an offset to\ninterest includible in gross income with\nrespect to the debt securities, and the U.S.\nHolder would not be required to\ninclude OID, if any, in gross income in\nrespect of the debt securities. In the case of\ndebt securities that provide for alternative\npayment schedules, the amount of premium\ngenerally is determined by assuming that a\nholder will exercise or not\nexercise options in a manner that maximizes\nthe holder\u0092s yield, and that the issuer will\nexercise or not exercise options in a manner\nthat minimizes the holder\u0092s yield. Any\nelection to amortize premium would apply to\nall debt securities\n(other than debt securities the interest on\nwhich is excludable from gross income) held or\nsubsequently acquired by a U.S. Holder on or\nafter the first day of the first taxable year\nto which the election applies and is\nirrevocable without the\nconsent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder that elects\nto amortize bond premium will be required to\nreduce its tax basis in the debt securities by\nthe amount of the premium amortized during its\nholding period. If a U.S. Holder does not\nelect to amortize bond\npremium, the amount of bond premium will be\nincluded in its tax basis in the debt\nsecurities. As such, if no election is made\nand the U.S. Holder holds the debt security to\nmaturity, the premium generally will be\ntreated as capital loss when the\ndebt security matures. Prospective investors\nshould consult their own tax advisors before\nmaking this election.\n\nElection to Treat All Interest as OID. U.S.\nHolders may elect to treat all interest in\nrespect of debt securities as OID and to\ncalculate the amount includible in gross\nincome for any taxable year under the constant\nyield method described above. For purposes of\nthis\nelection, interest includes stated interest,\nacquisition discount (the difference between\nan instrument\u0092s stated redemption price at\nmaturity and a holder\u0092s basis), OID, de\nminimis OID, market discount, de minimis\nmarket\ndiscount, and unstated interest, as adjusted\nby any amortizable bond premium or acquisition\npremium. If a U.S. Holder makes this election\nfor debt securities with amortizable bond\npremium, the election is treated as an\nelection under the amortizable\nbond premium rules described above and the\nelecting U.S. Holder will be required to\namortize bond premium for all other debt\ninstruments with amortizable bond premium held\nor subsequently acquired by the U.S. Holder.\nSimilar to an election to\namortize premium, the election to treat all\ninterest as OID must be made for the taxable\nyear in which the U.S. Holder acquires the\ndebt securities, and the election may not be\nrevoked without the consent of the IRS.\nProspective investors should\nconsult their own tax advisors before making\nthis election.\n\nSale, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition\nof Debt Securities.\nUpon the sale, retirement or other taxable\ndisposition of debt securities, a U.S. Holder\ngenerally will recognize U.S. source gain or\nloss equal to the difference between the\namount realized upon the sale, retirement or\nother taxable disposition\n(other than amounts representing accrued and\nunpaid qualified stated interest, which will\nbe taxable as ordinary interest income to the\nextent not previously included in gross\nincome) and the U.S. Holder\u0092s adjusted tax\nbasis of the debt\nsecurities. In general, the U.S. Holder\u0092s\nadjusted tax basis of the debt securities will\nequal the U.S. Holder\u0092s cost for the debt\nsecurities, increased by all accrued OID or\nmarket discount previously included in gross\nincome and reduced\nby any amortized premium and certain cash\npayments previously received in respect of the\ndebt securities other than qualified stated\ninterest payments. Except as described above\nwith respect to certain short-term debt\nsecurities, contingent payment\ndebt securities and debt securities acquired\nat a market discount, and except with respect\nto gain or loss attributable to changes in\nexchange rates (as discussed below), such gain\nor loss generally will be capital gain or loss\nand will be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if at the time of sale,\nretirement or other taxable disposition the\ndebt securities have been held for more than\none year. Under current U.S. federal income\ntax law, certain non-corporate\nU.S. Holders, including individuals, are\neligible for preferential rates of U.S.\nfederal income taxation in respect of long-\nterm capital gains. The deductibility of\ncapital losses is subject to limitations under\nthe Code.\n\nForeign Currency Debt Securities.In the case\nof debt securities denominated in a foreign\ncurrency (\u0093\u0094), U.S. Holders will need to\ncalculate and convert income into U.S. dollar\nvalues, and may be required to account for\ngain or loss in respect of exchange rate\nfluctuations, in accordance with special\nrules. In general, if an\ninterest payment is made in a foreign currency\nto a cash-method U.S. Holder, the U.S. Holder\nwill be required to include in gross income\nthe U.S. dollar value of the interest payment,\n\n141\n\ndetermined by translating the interest payment\nat the \u0093spot rate\u0094 in effect for the foreign\ncurrency on the date that payment is received,\nregardless of whether the payment in fact is\nconverted into U.S. dollars at that time. The\nU.S. dollar value will be the U.S. Holder\u0092s\ntax basis in the foreign currency received.\nThe U.S. Holder will not recognize any\nexchange gain or loss with respect to the\nreceipt of the interest\npayment.\n\nAn accrual-method U.S. Holder will be required\nto include in gross income for each taxable\nyear the U.S. dollar value of the\ninterest that has accrued during such year,\ndetermined by translating interest at the\naverage rate of exchange for the period or\nperiods during which interest accrued. Upon\nreceipt of an interest payment on the foreign\ncurrency debt securities (or\nthe receipt of payment of sale or other\ndisposition proceeds attributable to unpaid\ninterest that was previously accrued into\ngross income), such a U.S. Holder will\nrecognize exchange gain or loss in an amount\nequal to the difference between the\nU.S. dollar value of the payment, determined\nby translating the foreign currency received\nat the spot rate in effect of such foreign\ncurrency on the date received, and the U.S.\ndollar value of the interest income that the\nU.S. Holder has previously\nincluded in gross income with respect to the\npayment. Any exchange gain or loss generally\nwill be treated as ordinary income or loss,\nbut will not be treated as interest income or\nexpense, except to the extent provided in the\nTreasury regulations or\nadministrative pronouncements of the IRS.\n\nFor purposes of translating interest accruals\nunder the foregoing rules, the average rate of\nexchange for an interest accrual period\ngenerally is the simple average of the\nexchange rates in effect for each business day\nof the application period (or another average\nthat is reasonably derived and consistently\napplied by the U.S. Holder). A\nU.S. Holder may elect, however, to translate\ninterest accruals at the spot rate in effect\non the last day of the accrual period (or last\nday of the taxable year in the case of an\naccrual period that straddles the U.S.\nHolder\u0092s taxable year), or\non the date that the interest payment is\nreceived if that date is within five business\ndays of the end of the accrual period. The\nelection would apply to all foreign currency\ndebt securities held or subsequently acquired\nby the U.S. Holder on or\nafter the first day of the first taxable year\nto which the election applies and is\nirrevocable without the consent of the IRS.\n\nThe\namount of OID on foreign currency debt\nsecurities will be determined for any accrual\nperiod in the applicable foreign currency and\nthen translated into U.S. dollars in the same\nmanner as interest income accrued by a U.S.\nHolder using the accrual\nmethod of accounting for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes, as described above (regardless\nof such holder\u0092s regular method of tax\naccounting). Likewise, a U.S. Holder will\nrecognize foreign currency exchange gain or\nloss when payments\nattributable to the OID are made (including,\nupon the sale of such debt security, the\nreceipt of proceeds which include amounts\nattributable to OID previously included in\nincome) to the extent of the difference\nbetween the U.S. dollar value of the\naccrued OID (determined in the same manner as\nfor accrued interest) and the U.S. dollar\nvalue of the payment (determined by\ntranslating any foreign currency received at\nthe spot rate for the foreign currency on the\ndate of payment). For this\npurpose, all receipts on foreign currency debt\nsecurities will be viewed (i) first, as the\nreceipt of any periodic interest payments\nprovided under the terms of the foreign\ncurrency debt securities, (ii) second, as the\nreceipt of\npreviously accrued OID (to the extent of such\nOID), with payments considered made beginning\nwith the earliest accrual periods, and (iii)\nthereafter, as the receipt of principal.\n\nIf a U.S. Holder purchases foreign currency\ndebt securities with previously-owned foreign\ncurrency, the initial tax basis of the foreign\ncurrency debt securities will be the U.S.\ndollar value of the foreign currency paid,\ndetermined at the time of purchase. In the\ncase of foreign currency debt securities that\nare traded on an established securities\nmarket, a cash-method U.S. Holder\n(or an accrual-method U.S. Holder that so\nelects) will determine the U.S. dollar value\nof the cost of the foreign currency debt\nsecurities by translating the amount paid at\nthe spot rate in effect on the settlement date\nof the purchase. A U.S.\nHolder who purchases foreign currency debt\nsecurities with previously owned foreign\ncurrency will recognize exchange gain or loss\nat the time of purchase attributable to the\ndifference at the time of purchase, if any,\nbetween the U.S. Holder\u0092s\nadjusted tax basis in the foreign currency and\nthe fair market value of the foreign currency\ndebt securities, in U.S. dollars, on the date\nof purchase. The exchange gain or loss will be\nordinary income or loss.\n\n142\n\nWhen determining the amount of any gain or\nloss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale,\nretirement or other taxable disposition of\nforeign currency debt securities, the amount\nrealized will be the U.S. dollar value of the\namount realized in the foreign currency (other\nthan amounts attributable to accrued but\nunpaid interest, which\ngenerally will be treated as a payment of\ninterest), determined at the time of the sale,\nretirement or other taxable disposition and in\naccordance with the U.S. Holder\u0092s applicable\nmethod of accounting for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. In\nthe case of foreign currency debt securities\nthat are denominated in a foreign currency and\ntraded on an established securities market, a\ncash basis U.S. Holder (or an accrual basis\nU.S. Holder that so elects) will determine the\nU.S. dollar value of\nthe amount realized by translating at the spot\nrate in effect on the settlement date of the\nsale. A U.S. Holder will recognize exchange\ngain or loss attributable to the movement in\nexchange rates between the time of purchase\nand disposition of\nforeign currency debt securities. Such gain or\nloss generally will be treated as ordinary\nincome or loss from U.S. sources. The amount\nof exchange gain or loss will be limited to\nthe amount of overall gain or loss realized on\nthe sale, retirement or\nother taxable disposition of the foreign\ncurrency debt securities.\n\nA U.S. Holder\u0092s tax basis in foreign currency\nreceived as\ninterest on foreign currency debt securities\nwill be the U.S. dollar value of the interest\npayment at the spot rate in effect on the date\nthat the foreign currency is received. The tax\nbasis in foreign currency received on the\nsale, retirement or\nother taxable disposition of foreign currency\ndebt securities will be equal to the U.S.\ndollar value of the foreign currency,\ndetermined at the time of the sale, retirement\nor other taxable disposition in the manner\ndescribed above. Any gain or loss\nrecognized by a U.S. Holder on a taxable\ndisposition of the foreign currency will be\nordinary income or loss, but will not be\ntreated as interest income or expense, except\nto the extent provided in the Treasury\nregulations or administrative\npronouncements of the IRS.\n\nSpecial rules apply to foreign currency debt\nsecurities that are denominated in one of\ncertain\nhyperinflationary currencies, denominated in\nmultiple currencies, and contingent payment\ndebt securities denominated in a foreign\ncurrency. Prospective investors should\ncarefully examine the applicable prospectus\nsupplement for any such debt\nsecurities and should consult their own tax\nadvisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences of the ownership and disposition\nof such debt securities before deciding to\npurchase such debt securities.\n\nReportable Transactions.Applicable Treasury\nregulations require taxpayers that participate\nin \u0093reportable transactions\u0094 to\ndisclose their participation to the IRS by\nattaching Form 8886 to their U.S. federal tax\nreturns and to retain a copy of all documents\nand records related to the transaction. In\naddition, \u0093material advisors\u0094 with respect to\nsuch a\ntransaction are required to file returns and\nmaintain records, including lists identifying\ninvestors in the transactions, and to furnish\nthose records to the IRS upon demand. A\ntransaction may be a \u0093reportable transaction\u0094\nbased on any of\nseveral criteria, one or more of which may be\npresent with respect to an investment in the\ndebt securities. Whether an investment in the\ndebt securities constitutes a \u0093reportable\ntransaction\u0094 for any investor depends on that\ninvestor\u0092s particular circumstances. The\nTreasury regulations provide that, in addition\nto certain other transactions, a \u0093loss\ntransaction\u0094 constitutes a \u0093reportable\ntransaction.\u0094 A \u0093loss transaction\u0094 is any\ntransaction resulting in the taxpayer claiming\na loss under Section 165 of the Code in an\namount equal to or in excess of certain\nthreshold amounts. The Treasury regulations\nspecifically provide that a loss resulting\nfrom a\n\u0093Section 988 transaction\u0094 (which includes a\ntransaction payable in a foreign currency)\nwill constitute a Section 165 loss, and\ncertain exceptions will not be available if\nthe loss from sale or exchange is treated as\nordinary\nunder Section 988 of the Code. Therefore,\nlosses realized with respect to foreign\ncurrency debt securities may constitute a\nSection 988 transaction, and a holder of such\ndebt securities that recognizes exchange loss\nin an amount that\nexceeds the loss threshold amount applicable\nto that holder may be required to file Form\n8886. U.S. Holders should consult their own\ntax advisors concerning any possible\ndisclosure obligation they may have with\nrespect to their investment in foreign\ncurrency debt securities and should be aware\nthat, should any \u0093material advisor\u0094 determine\nthat the return filing or investor list\nmaintenance requirements apply to an offering\nof such debt securities, they would be\nrequired to comply with\nthese requirements.\n\n143\n\nCommon Stock and Preferred Stock\n\nDistributions. A distribution paid to a U.S.\nHolder by us in respect of common or preferred\nstock will constitute a dividend for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes to the extent the\ndistribution is paid out of our current or\naccumulated earnings and profits, as\ndetermined under U.S. federal income tax\nprinciples. The gross amount of any such\ndividend to a U.S. Holder will be\nincluded in the gross income of the U.S.\nHolder, as ordinary dividend income from U.S.\nsources. In general, distributions in excess\nof our current or accumulated earnings and\nprofits will not be taxable to a U.S. Holder\nto the extent that such\ndistributions to the U.S. Holder do not exceed\nthe U.S. Holder\u0092s adjusted tax basis in the\nshares of common or preferred stock with\nrespect to which the distribution is paid, but\nrather will reduce the U.S. Holder\u0092s adjusted\ntax basis in\nsuch common or preferred stock (but not below\nzero). To the extent that distributions exceed\nour current and accumulated earnings and\nprofits as well as the U.S. Holder\u0092s adjusted\ntax basis in the common or preferred stock,\nsuch distributions\ngenerally will be taxable as capital gain\nrealized in respect of the common or preferred\nstock.\n\nUnder current U.S. federal income tax\nlaw, dividends paid to certain non-corporate\nU.S. Holders, including individuals, generally\nwill constitute qualified dividend income\neligible for preferential rates of U.S.\nfederal income tax, provided\ncertain conditions and requirements are\nsatisfied, such as minimum holding period\nrequirements. U.S. Holders that are\ncorporations may be eligible for a partial\ndividends-received deduction with respect to\ndividend distributions that are paid in\nrespect of common or preferred stock, subject\nto certain conditions and requirements, such\nas minimum holding period requirements. There\ncan be no assurance that we will have\nsufficient current or accumulated earnings and\nprofits for distributions\nin respect of common or preferred stock to\nqualify as dividends for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes.\n\nU.S. Holders should be aware that\ndividends exceeding certain thresholds in\nrelation to such U.S. Holders\u0092 tax basis in\nthe common or preferred stock could be\ncharacterized as \u0093extraordinary dividends\u0094 (as\ndefined in Section 1059 of the Code).\nGenerally, a\ncorporate U.S. Holder that receives an\nextraordinary dividend is required to reduce\nits tax basis in the common or preferred stock\nby the portion of such dividend that is not\ntaxed because of the dividends received\ndeduction, and is required to\nrecognize taxable gain to the extent such\nportion of the dividend exceeds the U.S.\nHolder\u0092s tax basis in the common or preferred\nstock. U.S. Holders who are individuals and\nwho receive an \u0093extraordinary dividend\u0094 would\nbe required to\ntreat any losses on the sale of the common or\npreferred stock as long-term capital losses to\nthe extent that the dividends received by them\nqualified for the reduced tax rate on\nqualified dividend income, as described above.\n\nIn determining whether a dividend paid on\ncommon or preferred stock is an extraordinary\ndividend, a corporate U.S. Holder may elect to\nsubstitute the fair market value of the common\nor preferred stock for its tax basis for\npurposes of applying these tests if the fair\nmarket value as of the day before the ex-\ndividend date is established to the\nsatisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury.\nAn extraordinary dividend also includes any\namount treated as a dividend in the case of a\nredemption that is either non-pro rata as to\nall stockholders or in\npartial liquidation of the corporation,\nregardless of the stockholder\u0092s holding period\nand regardless of the size of the dividend.\nProspective investors in common or preferred\nstock should consult their own tax advisors\nwith respect to the\npotential application of the \u0093extraordinary\ndividend\u0094 rules to an investment in the common\nor preferred stock.\n\nSale or Other Taxable Dispositions of Common\nor Preferred Stock. In general, a U.S. Holder\nwill recognize capital gain or loss upon the\nsale or other taxable disposition of common or\npreferred stock in an amount equal to the\ndifference between the sum\nof the fair market value of any property\nreceived and the amount of cash received in\nsuch disposition and such U.S. Holder\u0092s\nadjusted tax basis in the common or preferred\nstock at the time of the disposition. A U.S.\nHolder\u0092s tax basis in\nthe common or preferred stock generally will\nbe equal to the cost of the common or\npreferred stock to such U.S. Holder, which may\nbe adjusted for certain subsequent events (for\nexample, if the U.S. Holder receives a\nnondividend distribution). Any\nsuch capital gain will be long-term capital\ngain if the common or preferred stock has been\nheld by the U.S. Holder for more than one\nyear. Under current U.S. federal income tax\nlaw, certain non-corporate U.S.\nHolders (including individuals) are\n\n144\n\neligible for preferential rates of U.S.\nfederal income tax on long-term capital gains.\nThe ability to utilize capital losses is\nsubject to limitations under the Code.\nRedemptions of Common Stock or Preferred\nStock.A redemption of shares of common or\npreferred stock generally will be treated\nunder Section 302 of the Code as a\ndistribution unless the redemption satisfies\none of the tests set forth in Section 302(b)\nof the Code and, therefore, treated as a sale\nor exchange of the common or preferred stock\nthat is redeemed. If a redemption of shares of\ncommon or preferred stock is treated as a sale\nor exchange, the redemption will be taxable as\ndescribed under \u0093\u0097Sale or Other Taxable\nDispositions of Common or Preferred Stock\u0094\nabove, except that an amount received in\nrespect of declared but unpaid dividends\ngenerally will be taxable as a dividend if we\nhave sufficient current or accumulated\nearnings and profits, as described above under\n\u0093\u0097Distributions.\u0094 A redemption will be treated\nas a sale or exchange if it:\n                                              \n  \u25cf    results in a complete termination of   \n       a U.S. Holder\u0092s interest in us,         \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25cf    is \u0093substantially disproportionate\u0094      \n       with respect to a U.S. Holder, or      \n                                              \n                                              \n       is not \u0093essentially equivalent to a     \n       dividend\u0094 with respect to a U.S.        \n  \u25cf    Holder, all within the meaning of      \n       Section\u00a0302(b) of the Code and         \n       applicable Treasury regulations.       \n                                              \nIn determining whether any of these tests has\nbeen met, shares of common or preferred stock\ndeemed owned by a U.S. Holder by reason of\ncertain constructive ownership rules under the\nCode, as well as shares actually owned by such\nU.S. Holder, must be taken into consideration.\nA redemption of shares of common and preferred\nstock held by a U.S. Holder generally will\nqualify for sale or exchange treatment if the\nU.S. Holder does not own (actually or\nconstructively) any shares of any classes of\nour common or preferred stock following the\nredemption; or if the U.S. Holder owns\n(actually or constructively) only an\ninsubstantial percentage of our common or\npreferred stock, such the redemption has the\neffect of decreasing such ownership\npercentage; and the U.S. Holder does not\nparticipate in our control or management.\nHowever, the determination as to whether any\nof the tests under Section 302(b) of the Code\nwill be satisfied with respect to any\nparticular U.S. Holder depends upon the facts\nand circumstances at the time of the\nredemption. If a redemption of shares of\ncommon or preferred stock is treated as a\ndistribution, the entire amount received will\nbe taxable as described under the caption\n\u0093\u0097Distributions\u0094 above. U.S. Holders should\nconsult their tax advisors regarding the\neffect of such transaction on the tax basis of\nany remaining shares of common or preferred\nstock held by such holders immediately after\nthe redemption. Prospective investors should\nconsult their own tax advisors for purposes of\ndetermining the tax consequences resulting\nfrom redemption of shares of common or\npreferred stock in their particular\ncircumstances. Terms of Preferred Stock.The\nU.S. federal income tax consequences of the\npurchase, ownership or disposition of\npreferred stock will depend on a number of\nfactors, including the specific terms of the\npreferred stock (such as any put or call\noption or redemption provisions, any\nconversion or exchange features and the price\nat which the preferred stock is sold).\nProspective investors should carefully examine\nthe applicable prospectus supplement and\nshould consult their own tax advisors,\nregarding the material U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences, if any, of the ownership and\ndisposition of preferred stock based upon\ntheir particular circumstances and the terms\nof the preferred stock. Medicare Tax A U. S.\nHolder that is an individual or estate, or a\ntrust that does not fall into a special class\nof trusts that is exempt from such tax, will\nbe subject to a 3.8% tax (the \u0093 Medicare\nTax\u0094). For individual U.S. Holders, the\nMedicare Tax applies on the lesser of (1) the\nU.S. Holder\u0092s \u0093net investment income\u0094 for the\nrelevant 145\n\ntaxable year and (2) the excess of the U.S.\nHolder\u0092s modified adjusted gross income for\nthe taxable year over a certain threshold. A\nU.S. Holder\u0092s net investment income will\ngenerally include its interest and dividend\nincome and net gain from the disposition of\nthe debt securities and common and preferred\nstock, unless such income and net gain is\nderived in the ordinary course of the conduct\nof a trade or business (other than a trade or\nbusiness that consists of certain passive or\ntrading activities). Net investment income\nmay, however, be reduced by properly allocable\ndeductions to such income. U.S. Holders that\nare individuals, estates or trusts are urged\nto consult their tax advisors regarding the\napplicability of the Medicare tax to their\nincome and gains from the debt securities,\ncommon stock and preferred stock. U.S. Federal\nIncome Taxation of Non-U.S.Holders Debt\nSecurities Payments of Interest( including\nOID). Subject to the discussion below\nconcerning backup withholding and the Foreign\nAccount Tax Compliance Act (\u0093 FATCA\u0094), any\npayment of principal (premium, if any) and\ninterest (including OID, if any) on the debt\nsecurities by us or our paying agent to any\nNon-U.S.Holder will be exempt from U.S.\nfederal income tax (including withholding\ntax), provided that:\n                                              \n       the Non-U.S. Holder does not own,      \n       actually or constructively, 10% or     \n  \u25cf    more                                   \n       of the total combined voting power of  \n       all classes of our stock entitled to   \n       vote;                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       the Non-U.S. Holder is not a           \n       controlled foreign corporation         \n       related,                               \n  \u25cf    directly or indirectly, to us through  \n       stock ownership or a bank receiving    \n       interest described in Section\u00a0         \n       881(c)(3)(A) of the Code;              \n                                              \n                                              \n       the interest is not effectively        \n       connected with the conduct by the      \n       Non-U.S. Holder to a trade or          \n       business within the United States      \n  \u25cf    (or, if an income tax treaty applies,  \n       is not attributable to a permanent     \n       establishment maintained by the        \n       Non-U.S. Holder in the United          \n       States);                               \n                                              \n                                              \n       the interest is not considered         \n       contingent interest under Section\u00a0     \n  \u25cf    871(h)(4)(A) of the Code and the       \n       Treasury                               \n       regulations thereunder; and            \n                                              \n                                              \n       the certification requirement has      \n  \u25cf    been fulfilled with respect to the     \n       beneficial owner, as discussed below.  \n                                              \nThe certification requirement referred to\nabove will be fulfilled if (i) the beneficial\nowner of the debt securities certifies on IRS\nForm W-8BENor W-8BEN-Eor other successor form,\nunder penalties of perjury, that such\nbeneficial owner is not a U.S. person and\nprovides its name and address, or (ii) in the\ncase of debt securities held on behalf of the\nbeneficial owner by a securities clearing\norganization, bank, or other financial\ninstitution holding customers\u0092 securities in\nthe ordinary course of its trade or business,\nsuch financial institution files with the\npaying agent a statement that it or another\nfinancial institution has received the IRS\nForm W-8BENor W-8BEN-Eor other successor form\nfrom the beneficial owner and furnishes the\npaying agent with a copy of such form. With\nrespect to debt securities held by a foreign\npartnership, unless the foreign partnership\nhas entered into a withholding agreement with\nthe IRS, the foreign partnership generally\nwill be required to provide an IRS Form\nW-8IMYor other successor form and to associate\nwith such form an appropriate certification or\nother appropriate documentation from each\npartner. Prospective investors, including\nforeign partnerships and their partners,\nshould consult their tax advisors regarding\nadditional reporting possible requirements. If\nthe certification requirement set forth above\nare not satisfied, a 30% withholding tax will\napply to the gross amount of interest\n(including OID, if any) on the debt securities\nthat is paid to a Non-U.S.Holder, unless\neither: (a) an applicable income tax treaty\nreduces or eliminates such tax, and the\nNon-U.S.Holder claims 146\n\nthe benefit of that treaty by providing us or\nour paying agent a properly completed and duly\nexecuted IRS Form W-8BENor W-8BEN-Eor other\nsuccessor form establishing qualification for\nbenefits under the treaty, or (b) interest\n(including OID, if any) on the debt securities\nis effectively connected with the\nNon-U.S.Holder\u0092s conduct of a trade or\nbusiness in the United States and the\nNon-U.S.Holder provides an appropriate\nstatement to us or the paying agent to that\neffect on a properly completed and duly\nexecuted IRS Form W-8ECI(or other applicable\nform), or other successor form. If a\nNon-U.S.Holder of debt securities is engaged\nin the conduct of a trade or business in the\nUnited States, and interest (including OID, if\nany) on the debt securities is effectively\nconnected with the conduct of such trade or\nbusiness (and, if required by an applicable\nincome tax treaty, is attributable to a\npermanent establishment maintained by the\nNon-U.S.Holder in the United States), the\nNon-U.S.Holder, although exempt from the\nwithholding tax discussed in the preceding\nsentence, will be subject to regular U.S.\nfederal income tax on its effectively\nconnected income, generally in the same manner\nas a U.S. Holder (or in a manner specified by\nan applicable income tax treaty). See \u0093\u0097U.S.\nFederal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders\u0094\nabove. A Non-U.S.Holder will need to obtain a\ntaxpayer identification number and certify as\nto its eligibility under the appropriate\ntreaty\u0092s limitations on benefits article to\nclaim benefits under an income tax treaty. In\naddition, special rules may apply to claims\nfor treaty benefits made by Non-U.S.Holders\nthat are entities rather than individuals. To\nobtain a refund of any excess amounts\nwithheld, a Non-U.S.Holder that is eligible\nfor a reduced rate of U.S. federal withholding\ntax pursuant to an income tax treaty may do so\nby filing an appropriate claim for refund with\nthe IRS. In addition, a Non-U.S.Holder that is\na foreign corporation may be subject to a 30%\nbranch profits tax (unless reduced or\neliminated by an applicable income tax treaty)\non its earnings and profits for the taxable\nyear attributable to its effectively connected\nincome, subject to certain adjustments. Sale,\nRetirement, or Other Taxable Disposition of\nDebt Securities. A Non-U.S.Holder generally\nwill not be subject to U.S. federal income tax\non gain realized on the sale, retirement or\nother taxable disposition of the debt\nsecurities, unless:\n                                              \n       the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual   \n       who is present in the U.S. for 183     \n  \u25cf    days or more in the taxable year of    \n       the disposition and certain other      \n       conditions are met; or                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       the gain is effectively connected      \n       with the Non-U.S. Holder\u0092s conduct      \n       of a trade or business in the United   \n       States (and, if required by an         \n  \u25cf    applicable income tax treaty, is       \n       attributable to a permanent            \n       establishment maintained by the        \n       Non-U.S. Holder in the United          \n       States).                               \n                                              \nIf the first exception applies, the\nNon-U.S.Holder generally will be subject to\nU.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% on\nthe amount by which its U.S.-source capital\ngains exceed its U.S.-source capital losses.\nIf the second exception applies, the\nnon-U.S.holder will generally be subject to\nU.S. federal income tax on the net gain\nderived from the sale or other disposition of\nthe debt securities in the same manner as a\nU.S. Holder. See \u0093\u0097U.S. Federal Income\nTaxation of U.S. Holders\u0094 above for a\ndescription of the U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations of acquiring, owning, and\ndisposing of debt securities. In addition, a\nNon-U.S.Holder that is a foreign corporation\nmay be subject to a 30% branch profits tax\n(unless reduced or eliminated by an applicable\nincome tax treaty) on its earnings and profits\nfor the taxable year attributable to its\neffectively connected income, subject to\ncertain adjustments. Common Stock and\nPreferred Stock Distributions. Except as\ndescribed below, a distribution paid to a\nNon-U.S.Holder by us in respect of common or\npreferred stock that are treated as dividends\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes, as\ndescribed under \u0093\u0097U.S. Federal Income Taxation\nof U.S. Holders\u0097Common Stock and Preferred\nStock\u0094 above, generally will be subject to\nU.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate, or\nsuch lower rate as may be specified by an 147\n\napplicable income tax treaty unless such\ndistributions are effectively connected with a\nNon-U.S. Holder\u0092s trade or business within the\nUnited States,\nor a permanent establishment maintained in the\nUnited States if certain tax treaties apply.\nIn order to claim the benefits of an\napplicable income tax treaty, a Non-U.S.\nHolder will be required to satisfy\napplicable certification (e.g., IRS Form\nW-8BEN or W-8BEN-E or other applicable or\nsuccessor form) and other requirements prior\nto the distribution date. Additionally,\nspecial rules may apply to claims for treaty\nbenefits made by Non-U.S. Holders that are\nentities rather than individuals. To obtain a\nrefund of any excess amounts\nwithheld, a Non-U.S. Holder that is eligible\nfor a reduced rate of U.S. federal withholding\ntax pursuant to an income tax treaty may do so\nby filing an appropriate claim for refund with\nthe IRS. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their\nown tax advisors regarding their entitlement\nto benefits under an applicable income tax\ntreaty and the requirements for claiming any\nsuch benefits.\n\nDividends paid to a Non-U.S. Holder that are\neffectively connected with its conduct of a\ntrade or\nbusiness within the United States (and, if\nrequired by an applicable income tax treaty,\nare attributable to a permanent establishment\nmaintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the\nUnited States) generally are\nexempt from the 30% U.S. federal withholding\ntax. Instead, any such dividends generally\nwill be subject to U.S. federal income tax in\nthe same manner as if the Non-U.S. Holder were\na U.S. Holder, as described\nabove. See \u0093\u0097U.S. Federal Income Taxation of\nU.S. Holders\u0094 above. Non-U.S. Holders will be\nrequired to comply with certification (e.g.,\nIRS Form\nW-8ECI or other applicable or successor form)\nand other requirements in order for\neffectively connected income to be exempt from\nthe 30% U.S. federal withholding tax. A\ncorporate\nNon-U.S. Holder also may be subject to an\nadditional \u0093branch profits tax\u0094 at a 30% rate\n(or such lower rate as may be specified by an\napplicable income tax treaty) with respect to\nany effectively\nconnected dividends, subject to certain\nadjustments.\n\nSale or Other Taxable Disposition of Common or\nPreferred Stock. Subject to\nthe discussions below concerning backup\nwithholding and FATCA, a Non-U.S. Holder\ngenerally will be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax on gain recognized on a sale or\nother taxable disposition of common or\npreferred stock under the same principles\ndiscussed in \u0093\u0097Sale, Retirement, or Other\nTaxable Disposition of Debt Securities\u0094 above\nand as long as we are not and have not been a\nUnited States real property holding\ncorporation for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes at any time during\nthe five year period (or shorter period in\nsome situations) ending on the date of the\ndisposition. We have not been, are not and do\nnot anticipate becoming a United States real\nproperty holding\ncorporation for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes.\n\nAs discussed above under \u0093\u0097U.S. Federal Income\nTaxation of U.S.\nHolders\u0097Common Stock and Preferred\nStock\u0097Redemptions of Common Stock or Preferred\nStock,\u0094 the proceeds received from a\nredemption of shares of common or preferred\nstock may be treated as a distribution in\ncertain circumstances, in\nwhich case, the discussion above under\n\u0093\u0097Distributions\u0094 would be applicable.\n\nTerms of Preferred Stock. The U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences of the\npurchase, ownership or disposition of\npreferred stock will depend on a number of\nfactors, including the specific terms of the\npreferred stock (such as any put or call\noption or redemption provisions, any\nconversion or exchange features and the price\nat which the preferred stock is sold).\nProspective investors should carefully examine\nthe applicable prospectus supplement and\nshould consult their own tax advisors,\nregarding the material U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences, if any, of the\nownership and disposition of preferred stock\nbased upon their particular circumstances and\nthe terms of the preferred stock.\n\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\n\nU.S. Holders.In general, a U.S. Holder (other\nthan exempt holders) will be subject to\ninformation reporting requirements with\nrespect\nto (i) payments of principal, premium (if\nany), and interest (including OID) paid in\nrespect of, and the proceeds from a sale,\nredemption or other disposition of the debt\nsecurities, and (ii) dividends and other\ntaxable distributions paid\nin respect of, and the proceeds from a sale,\nredemption or other disposition of, the common\nor preferred stock. In addition, such a U.S.\nHolder may be subject to backup withholding on\nsuch payments if the U.S. Holder (i) fails to\nprovide an\naccurate taxpayer identification number\n\n148\n\nto the payor; (ii) has been notified by the\nIRS of a failure to report all interest or\ndividends required to be shown on its U.S.\nfederal income tax returns; or (iii) in\ncertain\ncircumstances, fails to comply with applicable\ncertification requirements.\n\nAny amounts withheld under the backup\nwithholding rules will\nbe allowed as a refund or a credit against a\nU.S. Holder\u0092s U.S. federal income tax\nliability provided the required information is\nfurnished to the IRS on a timely basis. U.S.\nHolders should consult their tax advisors\nregarding the application\nof information reporting and backup\nwithholding rules in their particular\nsituations, the availability of an exemption\ntherefrom, and the procedure for obtaining\nsuch an exemption, if applicable.\n\nNon-U.S.Holders. In general, we or our paying\nagent must report to the IRS and to a Non-U.S.\nHolder the amount of interest (including OID,\nif any) on the debt securities, and dividends\non the common or preferred stock, paid to the\nNon-U.S. Holder and the\namount of U.S. federal withholding tax, if\nany, deducted from those payments. Copies of\nthe information returns reporting such\ninterest and dividend payments and any\nassociated U.S. federal withholding tax also\nmay be made available to the tax\nauthorities in the country in which the\nNon-U.S. Holder resides under the provisions\nof an applicable income tax treaty. A Non-U.S.\nHolder generally will not be subject\nto backup withholding with respect to payments\nthat we make on the debt securities or shares\nof common or preferred stock provided that we\nor our paying agent does not have actual\nknowledge or reason to know that the\nNon-U.S. Holder is a U.S. person (as defined\nunder the Code), and we or our paying agent\nhas received from the Non-U.S. Holder an\nappropriate completed certification of\nnon-U.S. status (i.e., IRS Form W-8BEN or\nW-8BEN-E or other applicable or successor IRS\nForm W-8). Information reporting and,\ndepending on the circumstances, backup\nwithholding will apply to the payment of the\nproceeds of a sale of debt securities or\nshares of common or preferred stock, as the\ncase may be, that is effected within the\nUnited States or effected outside the United\nStates through certain U.S.-related financial\nintermediaries, unless the Non-U.S. Holder\ncertifies under penalty of perjury\nas to its non-U.S. status, and the payor does\nnot have actual knowledge or reason to know\nthat the beneficial owner is a U.S. person, or\nthe Non-U.S. Holder otherwise\nestablishes an exemption.\n\nAny amounts withheld under the backup\nwithholding rules will be allowed as a refund\nor a credit against a Non-U.S. Holder\u0092s U.S.\nfederal income tax liability provided the\nrequired information is furnished to the IRS\non a timely basis. Non-U.S. Holders of debt\nsecurities\nshould consult their tax advisors regarding\nthe application of information reporting and\nbackup withholding rules in their particular\nsituations, the availability of an exemption\ntherefrom, and the procedure for obtaining an\nexemption, if\napplicable.\n\nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act\n\nFATCA, contained in Sections 1471 through 1474\nof the Code, imposes a 30% U.S. withholding\ntax on withholdable payments (as defined\nbelow)\nmade to a foreign financial institution,\nunless such institution enters into an\nagreement with the Treasury to, among other\nthings, collect and provide to it substantial\ninformation regarding such institution\u0092s\nUnited States financial account\nholders, including certain account holders\nthat are foreign entities with United States\nowners. The legislation also generally imposes\na 30% withholding tax on withholdable payments\nto a non-financial foreign\nentity unless such entity provides the paying\nagent with a certification that it does not\nhave any substantial United States owners or a\ncertification identifying the direct and\nindirect substantial United States owners of\nthe entity.\n\u0093Withholdable payments\u0094 include payments of\ninterest (including OID) with respect to debt\nsecurities and distributions in respect of\ncommon or preferred stock from sources within\nthe United States, unless the payments of\ninterest or\ndistributions are effectively connected with\nthe conduct of a United States trade or\nbusiness and taxed as such. An\nintergovernmental agreement between the United\nStates and an applicable foreign country, or\nfuture Treasury regulations, may modify\nthese requirements.\n\n149\n\nThese withholding and reporting requirements\ngenerally apply to U.S. source interest and\ndividends and to payments of gross proceeds\nfrom a sale or redemption. However, under\nproposed Treasury regulations (the preamble to\nwhich specifies that taxpayers are permitted\nto rely on them pending finalization), no\nwithholding under FATCA will\napply to payments of gross proceeds from a\nsale or redemption of any property of a type\nwhich can produce interest or dividends from\nsources within the United States. If we (or an\napplicable withholding agent) determine\nwithholding under FATCA is\nappropriate, we (or such agent) will withhold\ntax at the applicable statutory rate, without\nbeing required to pay any additional amounts\nas described in \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities\u0097Payment of Additional Amounts\u0094 in\nrespect of such\nwithholding. Investors are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors regarding the\napplication of the legislation and Treasury\nregulations to the debt securities.\n\n150\n\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)\nWe may sell the securities offered under this\nprospectus through agents, through\nunderwriters or dealers or directly to one or\nmore purchasers. Underwriters, dealers and\nagents that participate in the distribution of\nthe securities offered under this prospectus\nmay be underwriters as defined in the\nSecurities Act of 1933 and any discounts or\ncommissions received by them from us and any\nprofit on the resale of the offered securities\nby them may be treated as underwriting\ndiscounts and commissions under the Securities\nAct. Any underwriters or agents will be\nidentified and their compensation, including\nany underwriting discount or commission, will\nbe described in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. The applicable prospectus\nsupplement will also describe other terms of\nthe offering, including the initial public\noffering price, any discounts or concessions\nallowed or reallowed or paid to underwriters,\ndealers or agents and any securities exchanges\non which the offered securities may be listed.\nThe maximum discount or commission that may be\nreceived by any member of FINRA for sales of\nsecurities pursuant to this prospectus,\ntogether with the reimbursement of any counsel\nfees by us, will not exceed 8.00% of the\ninitial gross proceeds from the sale of any\nsecurities being sold. Any agreements that we\nenter into with underwriters, dealers and\nagents will contain, to the extent required,\ncontractual provisions required to comply with\nthe \u0093Restrictions on Qualified Financial\nContracts of Systemically Important U.S.\nBanking Organizations and the U.S. Operations\nof Systemically Important Foreign Banking\nOrganizations; Revisions to the Definition of\nQualifying Master Netting Agreement and\nRelated Definitions\u0094 as issued by the FRB, the\nFDIC and the OCC and other applicable law. The\ndistribution of the securities offered under\nthis prospectus may occur from time to time in\none or more transactions at a fixed price or\nprices, which may be changed, at market prices\nprevailing at the time of sale, at prices\nrelated to the prevailing market prices or at\nnegotiated prices. We may determine the price\nor other terms of the securities offered under\nthis prospectus by use of an electronic\nauction. We will describe in the applicable\nprospectus supplement how any auction will be\nconducted to determine the price or any other\nterms of the securities, how potential\ninvestors may participate in the auction and,\nwhere applicable, the nature of the\nunderwriters\u0092 obligations with respect to the\nauction. If the applicable prospectus\nsupplement indicates, we will authorize\ndealers or our agents to solicit offers by\ninstitutions to purchase offered securities\nfrom us under contracts that provide for\npayment and delivery on a future date. We must\napprove all institutions, but they may\ninclude, among others:\n                                      \n  \u25cf    commercial and savings banks;  \n                                      \n                             \n  \u25cf    insurance companies;  \n                             \n                       \n  \u25cf    pension funds;  \n                       \n                                  \n  \u25cf    investment companies; and  \n                                  \n                                              \n  \u25cf    educational and charitable             \n       institutions.                          \n                                              \nThe institutional purchaser\u0092s obligations\nunder the contract are only subject to the\ncondition that the purchase of the offered\nsecurities at the time of delivery is allowed\nby the laws that govern the purchaser. The\ndealers and our agents will not be responsible\nfor the validity or performance of the\ncontracts. One or more of our indirectly,\nwholly-owned subsidiaries, including, but not\nlimited to, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and\nWells Fargo Advisors (the trade name of the\nretail brokerage business of Wells Fargo\nClearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo\nAdvisors Financial Network, LLC), may help\nplace some of the 151\n\nsecurities offered under this prospectus. If\nthis occurs, the placement will comply with\nRule 5121 of FINRA. The underwriters, agents\nand dealers participating in the sale of\nsecurities\noffered by this prospectus will not confirm\nsales to accounts over which they exercise\ndiscretionary authority without the prior\nspecific written approval of the customer in\naccordance with Rule 5121 of FINRA.\n\nThis prospectus, together with any applicable\nprospectus supplement, may also be used by our\naffiliates, including, but not limited to,\nWells\nFargo Securities, LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors\n(the trade name of the retail brokerage\nbusiness of Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC\nand Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network,\nLLC), in connection with offers and sales of\nthe offered securities in\nmarket-making transactions at negotiated\nprices related to prevailing market prices at\nthe time of sale. Such affiliates may act as\nprincipals or agents in such transactions.\nNone of our affiliates have any obligation to\nmake a market in any of the\noffered securities and each may discontinue\nany market-making activities at any time\nwithout notice, at its sole discretion.\n\nThe\naggregate initial offering price specified on\nthe cover of the applicable supplement will\nrelate to an initial offering of securities,\nand will not relate to any securities to be\nsold in market-making transactions.\nInformation about the trade and\nsettlement dates, as well as the purchase\nprice, for a market-making transaction will be\nprovided to the purchaser in a separate\nconfirmation of sale. The securities to be\nsold in market-making transactions include\nsecurities issued after the date\nof this prospectus.\n\nWe may have agreements with the underwriters,\ndealers and agents, including our subsidiaries\nmentioned above, to\nindemnify them against certain civil\nliabilities, including liabilities under the\nSecurities Act, or to contribute with respect\nto payments which the underwriters, dealers or\nagents may be required to make as a result of\nthose certain civil\nliabilities.\n\nIn connection with any offering of the\nsecurities offered under this prospectus,\nunderwriters may engage in transactions\nthat stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect\nthe price of such securities or any other\nsecurities the prices of which may be used to\ndetermine payments on such securities. These\ntransactions may include short sales,\nstabilizing transactions and\npurchases to cover positions created by short\nsales. Short sales involve the sale by\nunderwriters of a greater number of securities\nthan the underwriters are required to purchase\nin the offering. Stabilizing transactions\nconsist of certain bids or\npurchases made for the purpose of preventing\nor retarding a decline in the market price of\nthe securities while the offering is in\nprogress.\n\nUnderwriters may also impose a penalty bid in\nany offering of securities offered under this\nprospectus through a syndicate of\nunderwriters.\nThis occurs when a particular underwriter\nrepays to the underwriters a portion of the\nunderwriting discount received by it because\nthe other underwriters have repurchased\nsecurities sold by or for the account of such\nunderwriter in stabilizing or\nshort covering transactions.\n\nThese activities by underwriters may\nstabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the\nmarket price of the\nsecurities offered under this prospectus. As a\nresult, the price of such securities may be\nhigher than the price that otherwise might\nexist in the open market. If these activities\nare commenced, they may be discontinued by\nunderwriters at any time.\nThese transactions may be effected in the\nover-the-counter market or otherwise.\n\nWhen we issue the securities offered by this\nprospectus, except for shares of common stock\nor debt securities issued upon a reopening of\nan\nexisting series of debt securities, they may\nbe new securities without an established\ntrading market. If we sell a security offered\nby this prospectus to an underwriter for\npublic offering and sale, the underwriter may\nmake a market for that\nsecurity, but the underwriter will not be\nobligated to do so and could discontinue any\nmarket making without notice at any time.\nTherefore, we cannot give any assurances to\nyou concerning the liquidity of any security\noffered by this prospectus.\n\nUnderwriters and agents and their affiliates\nmay engage in various activities which may\ninclude securities trading, commercial and\ninvestment banking, financial advisory,\ninvestment management, investment\n\n152\n\nresearch, principal investment, hedging,\nfinancing and brokerage activities.\nUnderwriters and agents and their affiliates\nmay be customers of, engage in transactions\nwith, or perform services for\nus or our subsidiaries in the ordinary course\nof their businesses. In addition, in the\nordinary course of their various business\nactivities, the underwriters and agents and\ntheir affiliates may make or hold a broad\narray of investments and actively\ntrade debt and equity securities (or related\nderivative securities) and financial\ninstruments (including bank loans) for their\nown account and for the accounts of their\ncustomers, and such investment and securities\nactivities may involve securities\nand instruments of ours or our affiliates.\nCertain of the underwriters and agents and\ntheir affiliates may have a lending\nrelationship with us and hedge their credit\nexposure to us consistent with their customary\nrisk management policies. Typically,\nsuch underwriters, agents or their affiliates\nwould hedge such exposure by entering into\ntransactions which consist of either the\npurchase of credit default swaps or the\ncreation of short positions in our securities,\nincluding potentially the\nsecurities offered hereby. Any such short\npositions could adversely affect future\ntrading prices of the securities offered\nhereby. In addition, in connection with the\ndistribution of the securities offered under\nthis prospectus, we may enter\ninto swap or other hedging transactions with,\nor arranged by, underwriters or agents or\ntheir affiliates. These underwriters or agents\nor their affiliates may receive compensation,\ntrading gain or other benefits from these\ntransactions. The\nunderwriters and agents and their affiliates\nmay also make investment recommendations\nand/or publish or express independent research\nviews in respect of such securities or\nfinancial instruments and may hold, or\nrecommend to clients that they\nacquire, long and/or short positions in such\nsecurities and instruments. The underwriters\nand agents and their affiliates may also make\ninvestment recommendations and/or publish or\nexpress independent research views in respect\nof such securities or\nfinancial instruments and may at any time\nhold, or recommend to clients that they\nacquire, long or short positions in such\nsecurities and instruments.\n\nDelivery of the securities will be made\nagainst payment therefor on or about the issue\ndate specified in a supplement to this\nprospectus.\nUnder Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades\nin the secondary market generally are required\nto settle in two business days after the date\nthe securities are priced, unless the parties\nto any such trade\nexpressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, if the\napplicable supplement to this prospectus\nspecifies that the issue date is more than two\nbusiness days after the date on which the\nsecurities are priced, purchasers who wish to\ntrade such securities at\nany time prior to the second business day\npreceding the issue date will be required, by\nvirtue of the fact that the securities will\nnot settle in T+2, to specify an alternative\nsettlement cycle at the time of any such trade\nto prevent a failed\nsettlement; such purchasers should also\nconsult their own advisors in this regard.\n\nSales Restrictions\n\nGeneral\n\nEach\nunderwriter will agree that it will, to the\nbest of its knowledge and belief, comply with\nall applicable securities laws and regulations\nin force in any jurisdiction in which it\npurchases, offers, sells or delivers our\nsecurities or possesses or\ndistributes this prospectus or the applicable\nprospectus supplement or any other offering\nmaterial and will obtain any required consent,\napproval or permission for its purchase,\noffer, sale or delivery of such securities\nunder the laws and\nregulations in force in any jurisdiction to\nwhich it is subject or in which it makes\npurchases, offers, sales or deliveries. We\nwill not have any responsibility for an\nunderwriter\u0092s compliance with applicable\nsecurities laws.\n\nNotice to Prospective Investors in Canada\n\nThe securities may be sold only to purchasers\npurchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as\nprincipal that are accredited investors, as\ndefined\nin National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus\nExemptionsor subsection 73.3(1) of the\nSecurities Act(Ontario), and are permitted\nclients, as defined in National Instrument\n31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions\nand Ongoing Registrant Obligations.

The\npurchaser should refer to any applicable\nprovisions of the securities legislation of\nthe purchaser\u0092s province or territory for\nparticulars of these rights or consult with a\nlegal advisor. Pursuant to section 3A.3 of\nNational Instrument 33-105 Underwriting\nConflicts(\u0093 NI 33-105\u0094), the underwriters are\nnot required to comply with the disclosure\nrequirements of NI 33-105regarding underwriter\nconflicts of interest in connection with this\noffering.
