In particular, forward-looking statements include, but are\nnot limited to, statements we make about our expectations for our operations\nand business and our corporate responsibility progress, plans, and goals\n(including environmental and human capital matters). Forward-looking\nstatements are not based on historical facts, but instead represent our\ncurrent expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy, and\nother future conditions. The inclusion of such statements is not an\nindication that these contents are necessarily material to investors or\nrequired to be disclosed in the Company\u2019s filings with the Securities and\nExchange Commission. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future,\nthey are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks, and changes in\ncircumstances that are difficult to predict. Actual results may differ\nmaterially from our forward-looking statements due to several factors.\nFactors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our\nforward-looking statements are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023. We caution you, therefore, against\nrelying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither\nstatements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future\nperformance. Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the\ndate on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual\nresults to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us\nto predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any\nforward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future\ndevelopments, or otherwise, and notwithstanding any historical practice of\ndoing so, except as may be required by law. In addition, historical, current,\nand forward-looking sustainability-related statements may be based on\nstandards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls\nand processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to\nchange in the future.\n\nReferences throughout this document to websites and our reports, including\nAnnual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2023, are\nprovided for convenience only, and the content on the referenced websites or\nreports is not incorporated by reference into this document.

We also recognize the\nCompany\u2019s progress in building its business in 2023, beyond this critical\nwork \u2013 for instance, growing credit cards, de-risking its Home Lending\nbusiness, better integrating technology into Consumer, Small and Business\nBanking, and achieving significant strategic wins in Corporate and Investment\nBanking. All of this occurred while the company continued to invest in its\ncommunities, in its employees, and in technology.\n\nAs part of our ongoing and intentional Board refreshment process, we are\npleased to put forth a new independent director nominee, Fabian T. Garcia,\nfor election at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

The REA also reviewed whether our   \n  policies and procedures are well designed to:                              \n  \u2022support our efforts to build and sustain an inclusive workplace; and      \n  \u2022identify and address allegations involving harassment and                 \n  discrimination.                                                            \n  Shareholder Feedback                                                       \n  Following our release of the REA, we conducted outreach with some of our   \n  largest shareholders and other shareholders who had expressed an interest  \n  in discussing the REA, representing approximately 29% of outstanding       \n  shares, and ultimately engaged with shareholders representing              \n  approximately 17% of outstanding shares. Through those engagements, we     \n  received positive feedback regarding the depth and breadth of the          \n  assessment. Shareholders expressed interest in understanding the           \n  Company\u2019s next steps for reviewing and addressing the recommendations      \n  included in the REA.                                                       \n  Our Next Steps                                                             \n  While we are still evaluating the recommendations in the REA, we have      \n  prioritized the review of the three recommendations related to the         \n  prevention of harassment and discrimination and in response are making     \n  consequential changes to our policies and practices. Accordingly, our      \n  2024 updates to our harassment and discrimination policies and procedures  \n  will implement a majority of these recommendations. In 2024, we will be    \n  updating our Harassment and Discrimination policies and procedures to      \n  affirm Wells Fargo\u2019s commitment to racial equity. We will also take        \n  regular steps to assess employee awareness of and comfort with the         \n  Company\u2019s anti-harassment and equal employment opportunity (EEO) policies  \n  and reporting channels.

This work includes engaging with a wide range of\nstakeholders outside Wells Fargo, whose efforts are needed to help us achieve\nour goals.\n\nAs part of Wells Fargo\u2019s overall corporate sustainability strategy, we have\nestablished a framework to prioritize the impact we aim to achieve through\nour activities. Our focused impact areas are categorized around both Climate\nAction and Community Impact, with a critical area of overlap.

We provide eligible full- and part-\ntime employees (and their eligible dependents, as applicable) with a\ncomprehensive set of benefits designed to protect their physical, emotional,\nand financial health to help them make the most of their well-being. We are\ndedicated to recruitment and career development practices that support our\nemployees and promote diversity throughout our workforce, including\nleadership positions.\n\nTalent and Culture\n\nWe are committed to a culture that attracts and retains the best people. Our\nculture is guided by a customer-centric focus informed by employee engagement\nand feedback and reinforced by clear employee expectations. Our employee\nexpectations are designed to be transparent and straightforward, to drive the\nhighest standards of integrity and operational excellence, and to provide\nguidance for doing what\u2019s right and doing it well.\n\nEmployee Expectations\n                                                              \n  Embrace candor    Do what\u2019s right    Be great at execution  \n                                                              \n                                                                             \n                    Champion                     Build high-performing       \n  Learn and grow    diversity, equity and        teams (for managers)        \n                    inclusion                                                \n                                                                             \nRisk-Focused Culture\n\nOur Board is responsible for holding senior management accountable for\ndefining and maintaining a culture designed to effectively manage risk. One\nof our Company\u2019s top priorities remains building a risk and control\ninfrastructure appropriate for our size and complexity. We expect our\nemployees to speak up when they see something that could cause harm to our\ncustomers, communities, employees, shareholders, or reputation. Because we\nbelieve risk management is everyone\u2019s responsibility, our employees are\nempowered and expected to challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to\nescalate their concerns. Employees are also required to complete annual risk\ntraining, and top leaders participate in Leadership Forum (Risk Mindset), an\nin-person training designed to help equip leaders to drive a strong risk\nculture.\n\nPerformance management is a key facet of how we align our culture and Company\nexpectations for our employees. The Board plays an important role in\noverseeing the Company\u2019s performance management and incentive compensation\nprograms through its HRC. The HRC\u2019s expansive responsibilities allow it to\nfocus on the alignment of our performance management and incentive\ncompensation programs with the Company\u2019s culture and employee conduct.\n\nEmployee Feedback\n\nWe believe in listening to and learning from our employees. We leverage\nemployee feedback to enhance the employee experience and drive improvements\nto our culture and processes. Employees are invited to share their thoughts\nthrough surveys, town halls, direct engagement between managers and\nemployees, and leader-led sessions. Employees also submit ideas through our\nemployee feedback platform called Loudspeaker, and some of these ideas have\nbeen implemented in recent years, leading to efficiencies, innovation, and\ngreater employee engagement. We conduct various surveys throughout the year,\nincluding our quarterly pulse surveys, exit surveys, and annual Global\nEmployee Survey. The surveys are a way for employees to share their candid\nthoughts and feedback. Senior leadership and our directors analyze employee\nfeedback, as shared in the survey results, to help the Company improve\nemployee experience, workplace engagement, and the way we do business.\n\nCustomer Focus\n\nWe believe that meeting the increasingly diverse needs of our customer base\nis critical to our Company\u2019s long-term growth and success. We invest in\nemployee learning and development and believe that when our employees are\nproperly supported, engaged, and confident in their skills, they are more\neffective leaders and can provide a better customer experience. We remain\nfocused on customer experience and customer fairness.\n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement7                                                      \n                                                                             \nTable of Contents\n\nSustainability, Human Capital Management, and DE&I\n\nEmployee-Centric Support, Policies & Programs 1\n                                                                             \n  Talent Development & Recognition                                           \n  Programs                                                                   \n  Annually invest in employee and                                            \n  manager development                                                        \n  \u2022Approximately $200 million                                                \n  invested in a variety of employee                                          \n  learning and development programs,                                         \n  including functional training,                                             \n  regulatory compliance, leadership                                          \n  and professional development, and     Global recognition program           \n  early talent development programs.    \u2022Recognizing performance, personal   \n  \u2022Our employees engaged in 9.3         and professional achievements, and   \n  million hours of training in          supporting peer-to-peer recognition  \n  support of their development.         and appreciation via e-Cards.        \n  \u2022Academies designed to support        Employee recognition with a $1,000   \n  skill building in strategic areas     one-time cash payment                \n  such as Technology and Product.       \u2022In recognition of employees\u2019        \n  \u2022Manager Development programs         performance for great customer       \n  offer management essential skill      service in 2023, a one-time cash     \n  development and on-demand             payment of $1,000 was announced for  \n  solutions.

We\nhave conducted an annual pay equity review through engagement with a third-\nparty consultant for a number of years. The pay equity review compares the\ncompensation of women to men globally and U.S. minorities versus U.S. non-\nminorities taking into account factors such as role, level, tenure, and\ngeography. We may make adjustments to compensation in the event the review\nidentifies gaps. The year-end 2023 review showed that women at Wells Fargo\ncontinue to earn more than 99 cents for every $1 earned by their male peers,\nand U.S. employees who are racially/ethnically diverse earn more than 99\ncents for every $1 earned by their Caucasian/white peers.\n\nWhere to Find Additional Information\n\nFor more information on our human capital management and DE&I practices,\nplease see our disclosures available on the Corporate Responsibility Goals\nand Reporting page of our website at\nhttps://www.wellsfargo.com/about/corporate-responsibility/goals-and-\nreporting/ .

Board believe that it is essential that the composition of\nour Board reflects the diversity of the communities we serve. As described in\nthe Corporate Governance Guidelines and the GNC\u2019s charter, the GNC will\nconsider, in identifying or evaluating first-time candidates or nominees for\ndirector, the current composition of our Board and the interplay of the\ncandidate\u2019s or nominee\u2019s experience, education, skills, background, gender,\nrace, ethnicity, and other qualities and attributes with those of the other\nBoard members.\n\nThe GNC believes that it has been successful in its efforts over the years to\npromote gender, race, and ethnic diversity on our Board. Our Board believes\nthat our director nominees for election at our 2024 Annual Meeting bring to\nour Board a variety of different backgrounds, skills, professional and\nindustry experience, and other personal qualities, attributes, and\nperspectives that contribute to the overall diversity of our Board. The Board\nexpects to maintain its focus on Board diversity as well as on other desired\nqualifications and experience identified by the Board in future director\nrecruitment efforts.\n\nThe GNC and our Board will continue to monitor the effectiveness of their\npractices in any new director search efforts and in their annual self-\nevaluation process.\n\nDirector Nominee Diversity Highlights\n                                                                             \n  54%                                   50%                                  \n  director nominees                     Board committee chairs               \n  are gender and/or                     are gender and/or                    \n  racially/ethnically diverse           racially/ethnically diverse          \n  38%                                   31%                                  \n  director nominees                     director nominees                    \n  are women                             are racially/ethnically diverse      \n                                        <65 years\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   65-70 years\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0       \n  65 years                              >70 years                            \n  average age of                        6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    2                    \n  independent director nominees         age range of independent director    \n                                        nominees                             \n                                                                             \nDiversity Among Our Director Nominees\n                                                                             \n       S\u2026    \u2026    C\u2026    \u2026    R\u2026    \u2026    W\u2026    \u2026    M\u2026    \u2026    R\u2026    \u2026    S\u2026  \n       D.    \u2026    A.    \u2026    K.    \u2026    M.    \u2026    R.    \u2026    L.    \u2026    M.  \n       B\u2026    \u2026    C\u2026    \u2026    D\u2026    \u2026    H\u2026    \u2026    M\u2026    \u2026    S\u2026    \u2026    V\u2026  \n                        \u2026                                                    \n  \u2026    M     M    W     M    M     M    M     W    W     W    M     M    W   \n  \u2026               \u2b24                \u2b24    \u2b24                \u2b24                   \n  \u2026                                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  16Wells Fargo & Co.                                                        \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Board and Governance Matters                                               \n                                                                             \nOther Policies and Practices\n\nDirector Tenure and Retirement Age Policies\n\nThe Board\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines reflect the Board\u2019s recognition\nof the importance of periodic Board refreshment and maintaining an\nappropriate balance of tenure, experience, and perspectives on the Board.\n\nThe Board values the contributions of both newer directors and directors who\nhave developed extensive experience and insight into the Company. The Board\nbelieves that directors should not have an expectation of being renominated\nannually and that the Board\u2019s annual self-evaluation is a key component of\nits director nomination process.\n\nAs set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board has\nestablished a retirement policy, pursuant to which non-management directors\nwill not be nominated for a term beginning after their 75th birthday. The\nBoard may, however, approve the nomination of a non-management director after\nthe age of 75 if, due to special or unique circumstances, the Board\ndetermines that it is in the best interest of our Company and shareholders\nfor the individual to be nominated for election.

Given the significant\nresponsibilities of directors, each director must be ready, willing, and able\nto devote sufficient time to carrying out their Board responsibilities\neffectively.\n\nIn accordance with the Corporate Governance Guidelines, unless the GNC\ndetermines that such other board service would not impair the director\u2019s\nservice to the Company, directors may not serve as a director on the board of\ndirectors of more than four public companies, including the Company, and a\ndirector who serves as the CEO of a public company may not serve as a\ndirector on the board of directors of more than three public companies,\nincluding the boards of the Company and the company of which such director\nserves as CEO. All of our directors are in compliance with this policy.\n\n1. Based on completed years of service from the date first elected to the\nBoard.

Each year, our Board affirmatively determines the independence of\neach director and each nominee for election as a director. Under New York\nStock Exchange ( NYSE ) rules, in order for a director to be considered\nindependent, our Board must determine that the director has no material\nrelationship with our Company (either directly or as a partner, shareholder,\nor officer of an organization that has a relationship with our Company). To\nassist our Board in making its independence determinations, our Board adopted\nthe Director Independence Standards appended to our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines. These Director Independence Standards consist of the NYSE\u2019s\n\u201cbright line\u201d standards of independence, as well as additional standards,\nknown as categorical standards of independence, adopted by our Board. The\nDirector Independence Standards are available as an appendix to our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines on our website at:\nhttps://www.wellsfargo.com/about/corporate/governance .\n\nBased on the Director Independence Standards, our Board considered\ninformation in early 2024 regarding banking and financial services,\ncommercial, charitable, familial, and other relationships between each\ndirector and director nominee, his or her respective immediate family\nmembers, and/or certain entities affiliated with such directors, director\nnominees, and immediate family members, on the one hand, and our Company, on\nthe other, to determine the director\u2019s or director nominee\u2019s independence.\nAfter reviewing the information presented to it and considering the\nrecommendation of the GNC, our Board determined that, except for Charles W.\nScharf, who is a Wells Fargo employee, all other current directors and\ndirector nominees are independent under the Director Independence Standards :\nSteven D.

In reviewing and considering\nany changes to this structure, the Board, including the GNC, would consider\nthe structure that best serves the interests of our shareholders, taking into\naccount any feedback heard during investor and other stakeholder engagement.\n\nAdditionally, 12 of the 13 director nominees are independent under the\nDirector Independence Standards adopted by our Board, which include the\nNYSE\u2019s corporate governance rules, and all members of our standing Board\nCommittees are independent.\n\nThe Board has adopted, and annually reviews and approves, well-defined\nauthority and responsibilities of the independent Chair, as reflected in the\nchart below.\n\nKey Areas of Authority/Responsibility of Independent Board Chair\n                                                                             \n                                       \u2022Provide input on the composition of  \n                                       the Board and its committees, and     \n                                       selection of Committee Chairs, so     \n                                       they have the diversity of skills     \n  Board Composition and Committee      and experiences necessary to oversee  \n  Membership                           our risks.                            \n                                       \u2022Evaluate potential Board candidates  \n                                       along with the Chair of the GNC, and  \n                                       make director candidate               \n                                       recommendations to the GNC.           \n  Board Effectiveness                  \u2022Promote the Board\u2019s efficient and    \n                                       effective functioning.                \n                                       \u2022Serve as the principal liaison       \n                                       among the independent directors and   \n                                       between the independent directors     \n                                       and the CEO and other members of      \n                                       senior\u00a0management.                    \n                                       \u2022Facilitate effective communication   \n  Board Communications and External    between the Board and shareholders.   \n  Stakeholders                         \u2022Facilitate the Board\u2019s review and    \n                                       consideration of shareholder          \n                                       proposals.                            \n                                       \u2022Serve as an additional point of      \n                                       contact for the Company\u2019s primary\u00a0    \n                                       regulators.                           \n                                       \u2022Preside over each annual meeting of  \n                                       shareholders.                         \n  Advisory Role                        \u2022Serve as an advisor to the CEO.      \n                                       \u2022Participate, along with other        \n  CEO Performance Evaluation           directors, in the performance         \n                                       evaluation of the\u00a0CEO.                \n                                       \u2022Set the ethical tone for the Board   \n  Ethics and Culture                   and reinforce a strong ethical        \n                                       culture.                              \n                                       \u2022Lead the Board\u2019s review of the       \n                                       Company\u2019s strategic initiatives and   \n  Company Strategy                     plans and discuss the implementation  \n                                       of those initiatives and plans with   \n                                       the CEO.                              \n                                                                             \nAnnual Independent Chair Selection\n\nOur Board\u2019s GNC is responsible for periodically evaluating our Board\u2019s\nleadership structure, and based on the GNC\u2019s recommendation, our Board\nselects the independent Chair annually.

In 2023 there\nwas one subcommittee of the Risk Committee: the Credit Subcommittee.\n\nFrom time to time, the Board may form special purpose committees to which the\nBoard may delegate responsibility for oversight of particular matters.\n\nCommittee Composition\n\nThe Board appoints the members and chair of each committee based on the\nrecommendation of the GNC.\n\nAs part of this process, the GNC annually reviews the committee structure,\ncommittee assignments, and chair positions and recommends to the Board the\nassignment of Board members to various committees. The GNC may recommend\nchanges to committee membership based on committee needs, director experience\nand interest, and to provide for a succession plan for a committee chair.\nAlso annually, the GNC reviews whether rotation of each committee chair is\ndesirable due to the length of a director\u2019s service as chair, best practices\nwith respect to committee refreshment or committee chair rotation, or other\nreasons.\n\nThe GNC also reviews each director nominee\u2019s qualifications and experience as\nit evaluates the composition of each committee in light of the particular\ncommittee\u2019s oversight responsibilities. The collective qualifications and\nexperience of the nominees who sit on each committee are noted below under\nBoard Committee Members and Oversight Responsibilities .\n\nEach of our Board\u2019s six standing committees is composed entirely of\nindependent directors. Each member of these committees in 2023 was\nindependent and fulfilled the requirements applicable to each committee on\nwhich he or she served.\n\nCommittee Charters\n\nEach Board committee\u2019s charter is available on our website at:\nhttps://www.wellsfargo.com/about/corporate/governance/ .\n\nAs required by its charter, each of our committees annually reviews and\nassesses its charter\u2019s adequacy, reviews its performance, and is responsible\nfor overseeing reputation risk related to its responsibilities.\n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement35                                                     \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Board and Governance Matters                                               \n                                                                             \nBoard Committee Members and Oversight Responsibilities\n\nOur Board committees and their primary responsibilities are described below.\nFor more information on how our Board and its committees oversee strategy,\nrisk management, and other key areas of oversight, see The Board\u2019s Role and\nResponsibilities .\n                                                                             \n  Audit Committee                                                            \n  Key Skills and                                     Number of Meetings in   \n  Experiences                                        2023                    \n  Represented                                                                \n                                                     12meetings              \n                                                     (includes 1 joint       \n  Accounting, Financial                              meeting with the Risk   \n  Reporting                Risk Management           Committee and 3 joint   \n                                                     meetings with the\u00a0Risk  \n                                                     Committee\u2019s Credit      \n                                                     Subcommittee)           \n                           Primary                                           \n                           Responsibilities                                  \n                           \u2022Oversees the                                     \n                           integrity of our                                  \n                           financial statements                              \n                           and the adequacy and                              \n                           reliability of                                    \n                           disclosures, including                            \n                           our internal controls                             \n                           over financial                                    \n                           reporting.                                        \n                           \u2022Selects and evaluates                            \n                           our independent                                   \n                           auditor, including its                            \n                           qualifications and                                \n                           independence.                                     \n                           \u2022Approves the                                     \n                           appointment and                                   \n                           compensation of our                               \n                           Chief Auditor and                                 \n                           oversees the                                      \n                           performance and                                   \n                           independence of the                               \n                           Chief Auditor and the                             \n                           Internal Audit                                    \n                           function.                                         \n                           \u2022Assists the Board and                            \n                           the Risk Committee in                             \n                           the oversight of                                  \n  Members                  compliance with                                   \n  Theodore F.

As described\nunder the Related Person Transactions section of this Proxy Statement, in\n2023, some HRC members had banking or financial services transactions in the\nordinary course of business with our banking and other subsidiaries.\n\n1.

All of\nour current directors attended our Company\u2019s 2023 annual shareholder meeting.\n\nOur Board held eight regular meetings and one special meeting, as well as\nadditional update and informational sessions between Board meetings, during\n2023. Attendance by our Board\u2019s current directors at meetings of our Board\nand its committees (including subcommittees) averaged more than 95% during\n2023.\n\nOur Board met in executive session without management present during nearly\nall of its 2023 regular board meetings. As described in the Strong\nIndependent Board Leadership section of this Proxy Statement, the independent\nChair of our Board, Steven D. Black, chairs executive sessions of the non-\nmanagement and independent directors. Committee meetings include executive\nsessions led by the respective independent committee chair.\n\nDirector Engagement Beyond the Boardroom\n\nIn addition to preparing for and participating in frequent Board and\ncommittee meetings, our directors engage with key internal and external\nstakeholders. Through these interactions, they gain valuable insights and\nshare perspectives relevant to our business and the oversight of our strategy\nand risks.\n                                                                             \n  Director Engagements Outside of                                            \n  Board and Committee Meetings                                               \n  Our independent Chair of the Board                                         \n  and the chairs of our standing                                             \n  committees participated in                                                 \n  numerous stakeholder meetings in                                           \n  2023 on behalf of the Board,                                               \n  outside of formal Board or                                                 \n  committee meetings.                                                        \n                                        These meetings include:              \n                                        \u2022Engagement with Management: Our     \n                                        independent Chair and committee      \n                                        chairs meet with key members of      \n                                        management, including our Chief      \n                                        Risk Officer and Chief Auditor.      \n                                        \u2022Engagement with Regulators: Our     \n  Key Stakeholders Engaged              independent Chair, members of our    \n                                        Risk Committee and other certain     \n                                        directors meet with our primary      \n                                        bank regulators.                     \n                                        \u2022Engagement with Shareholders: Our   \n                                        independent Chair participates in    \n                                        select engagements with key          \n                                        shareholders.                        \n  Operating Committee members                                                \n  Senior leadership                                                          \n  Internal audit                                                             \n  Other employees                                                            \n  Shareholders                                                               \n  Regulators                                                                 \n  Independent auditor                                                        \n  Independent compensation                                                   \n  consultants                                                                \n  Third-party search firms                                                   \n  Other stakeholders                                                         \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement41                                                     \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Board and Governance Matters                                               \n                                                                             \nDirector Orientation, Training, and Education\n\nDirectors receive a comprehensive orientation to the Company when they join\nthe Board, and continue to receive ongoing education and training relevant to\nour business and industry. From time to time, directors are also offered the\nopportunity to learn more about specific risk and regulatory matters by way\nof informal sessions with relevant executives and are empowered to seek\naccess to management and independent advisors to obtain any additional\ninformation needed.\n\nDirectors of our Board are offered training and education opportunities that\nadvance their understanding and experience with risk management in key and\nemerging areas. For example, two directors (Mr. Craver and Ms. Morken) have\ndeveloped information security, cybersecurity, and technology experience by\nobtaining a CERT Certificate in Cybersecurity Oversight from the National\nAssociation of Corporate Directors.\n\nDirector Education Opportunities\n                                                                             \n                                 All new directors receive an orientation    \n                                 to the Company.

Our Board\u2019s\nannual self-evaluation also is a key component of its director nomination\nprocess and succession planning.\n\nDesigning the Evaluation Process\n\nThe GNC, in consultation with our independent Chair, reviews and determines\nthe overall process, scope, and content of our Board\u2019s annual self-evaluation\nprocess. The GNC has continued to enhance the Board\u2019s self-evaluation process\nbased on director feedback, best practices, experience, and regulatory\nexpectations.\n\nThird-Party Assistance\n\nWe engaged a third party to facilitate the Board's self-evaluation in each of\nthe past four years.\n\nEach year, the GNC considers whether to engage a third party to assist the\nBoard in conducting its self-evaluation. The process for 2023 included\nindividual interviews with each of the directors by the third-party\nfacilitator, individual conversations with our independent Chair, and\ndiscussions of the results of the Board and Committee self-evaluations with\nboth the GNC and the Board.\n\nBoard Self-Evaluation Process\n\nThe following chart reflects the key components of the Board\u2019s annual self-\nevaluation process.

management. The Board\u2019s role in this regard is to assess management\u2019s\nperformance, provide credible challenge, hold senior management accountable\nfor maintaining an effective risk management program and adhering to risk\nmanagement expectations, and provide effective reporting to the Board.\nSpecifically, the Board\u2019s risk-related oversight responsibilities include\nreviewing, monitoring and, where appropriate, approving:\n\n\u2022 Our strategic plan, risk appetite, risk management framework, and financial\nperformance.\n\n\u2022 Our significant policies, programs, and plans, including whether they are\nconsistent with our strategic plan, risk appetite, and risk management.\n\n\u2022 Accountability of senior management for implementing the Company\u2019s\nstrategic plan, including risk appetite, and maintaining the Company\u2019s risk\nmanagement and control framework.\n\n\u2022 Board composition, governance structure, and practices that support the\nCompany\u2019s risk profile, risk appetite, and strategic plan, including having\ndirectors with diverse skills, knowledge, experience, and perspectives.\n\n\u2022 Our independent risk management (including compliance), legal, and internal\naudit functions.\n\n\u2022 Our culture of ethics, compliance, and risk management, and the processes\nadopted by senior management for maintaining the integrity and reputation of\nthe Company.\n\nWhen reviewing risks, the Board evaluates the materiality and control\neffectiveness of risks and may modify the frequency or manner of its\noversight to match the impacts of risks facing the Company.\n\nThe Board\u2019s Focus on Risk Oversight and Regulatory Matters\n\nThe Board\u2019s oversight of risk and regulatory matters is a primary focus at\nour Board and Board committee meetings, in order to provide for effective\nchallenge to management when necessary. In support of this:\n\n\u2022 At each of the nine regularly scheduled Board meetings in 2023, the meeting\nincluded a discussion of significant risk and regulatory matters with senior\nexecutives, including our CEO, CFO, CRO, COO, Chief Auditor, and General\nCounsel.\n\n\u2022 The Board, either directly or through its committees, periodically receives\nupdates from line of business CEOs and enterprise function heads, which\ninclude significant risks and issues relevant to the business group or\nenterprise function. The Board also receives reports from its standing\ncommittees at each regular Board meeting.\n\n\u2022 The Board receives Independent Risk Management\u2019s evaluation of risks that\nmay be associated with the Company\u2019s strategic plan when the Board reviews\nand approves the Company\u2019s strategic plan.\n\n\u2022 The Board meets annually with its primary bank regulators, and the\nindependent Chair of our Board and the chairs of certain of its committees,\nas well as the chair of the Bank Board, meet individually with our bank\nregulators.\n\n\u2022 Our independent Board Chair Steven D. Black has extensive risk management\nexperience. He engages with our regulators, shareholders, and other\nstakeholders, seeks to incorporate risk and regulatory topics in regular\ndiscussions between the Board and management, and provides input on the\ncomposition of the Board and its committees so that each has the diversity of\nskills and experiences necessary to oversee our risks.\n\nRole of Board Committees\n\nThe Board also carries out its risk oversight responsibilities through its\ncommittees. Each Board committee is responsible for overseeing risks within\nits purview. All six standing Board committees, which are comprised solely of\nindependent directors, report to the Board about their activities, including\nrisk oversight-related matters. Each Board committee has defined authority\nand responsibilities for primary oversight of specific risks, as outlined in\nits respective charter, and works closely with management to understand and\noversee our Company\u2019s key risks. Each Board committee may delegate certain of\nits oversight responsibilities to a subcommittee to assist in its duties.\n\nIn addition to the risk oversight structure at the parent level, the board of\ndirectors of the Company\u2019s principal banking subsidiary, WFBNA, has\nestablished the Regulatory Compliance Oversight Committee ( RCOC ). The RCOC\noversees compliance with certain regulatory consent orders and other\nenforcement actions for which oversight has been delegated by either the\nBoard or the Bank Board.\n

For example, the Board reviews the results of our  \n  annual Global Employee Survey with management, has reviewed management     \n  reports on Wells Fargo\u2019s culture, and reviewed the REA with the            \n  third-party law firm that conducted it. Our Board periodically reviews     \n  with management special topics relating to human capital matters, such as  \n  labor relations and DE&I.                                                  \n  As part of its review and approval of our overall three-year strategic     \n  plan, our Board annually engages with our Head of Human Resources          \n  regarding the strategy for the Human Resources department and reviews our  \n  Independent Risk Management team\u2019s assessment of that strategy.            \n  Human Resources Committee                                                  \n  \u2022The HRC oversees performance management, talent management, DE&I, pay     \n  equity, and succession planning for the CEO and other senior executives    \n  as determined by the HRC.                                                  \n  \u2022The HRC periodically reviews the Code of Conduct as well as management\u2019s  \n  efforts to foster responsible conduct and ethical behavior and             \n  decision-making throughout Wells Fargo.                                    \n  \u2022The HRC regularly engages with and reviews reports from our Head of       \n  Human Resources and our senior executive who oversees conduct management,  \n  including:                                                                 \n  \u2013Culture reports and metrics, including the results of our annual Global   \n  Employee Survey;                                                           \n  \u2013Conduct management reports, metrics and trends, including harassment and  \n  discrimination metrics and whistleblower retaliation matters;              \n  \u2013Human capital risk reports and metrics, emerging trends such as labor     \n  relations, and monitoring of human capital risks such as staffing and      \n  attrition; related risk appetite measures and key risk indicators; and     \n  the results of internal audit reviews of Human Resources; and              \n  \u2013Regulatory matters relating to the Human Resources function.              \n                                                                             \nRisk is Managed by Everyone\n\nEvery employee, in the course of their daily activities, creates risk and is\nresponsible for managing risk. Every employee has a role to play in risk\nmanagement, including establishing and maintaining the Company\u2019s control\nenvironment. Every employee must comply with applicable laws, regulations,\nand Company policies.\n\nOne of our Company\u2019s top priorities remains building a risk and control\ninfrastructure appropriate for our size and complexity. We expect our\nemployees to speak up when they see something that could cause harm to our\ncustomers, communities, employees, shareholders, or reputation. Because we\nbelieve risk management is everyone\u2019s responsibility, our employees are\nempowered and expected to challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to\nescalate their concerns. Employees are also required to complete annual risk\ntraining, and top leaders participate in Leadership Forum (Risk Mindset), an\nin-person training designed to help equip leaders to drive a strong risk\nculture.\n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement49                                                     \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Board and Governance Matters                                               \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n   Compensation Risk Management                                              \n                                                                             \nThe Board plays an important role in overseeing the Company\u2019s performance\nmanagement and incentive compensation programs through its HRC. The HRC\u2019s\nexpansive responsibilities allow it to focus on the alignment of our\nperformance management and incentive compensation programs with the Company\u2019s\nculture and employee conduct.\n\nKey Highlights in Compensation Risk Management\n\n\u2022 The HRC considers risk as a key input into its compensation decisions for\nthe CEO and Operating Committee.\n\n\u2022 An enhanced risk assessment process applies to Covered Employees in\nManagement ( CEMs ), which include the CEO, members of the Operating\nCommittee, individual leaders who run the Company\u2019s major lines of business,\nand certain other senior leaders whose responsibilities and actions may\nexpose the Company to material risk or who have roles that are subject to\nspecific regulatory requirements.\n\n\u2022 The CEO\u2019s performance review of members of the Operating Committee (except\nfor the CRO and Chief Auditor, for whom the risk review is conducted by the\nChairs of the Risk Committee and Audit Committee, respectively) is informed\nby a risk review conducted by the CRO (with input from risk leaders), and\nfeedback from Internal Audit.\n\n\u2022 The HRC conducts the risk review for the CEO, as described in our\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis .\n\n\u2022 A risk overlay rating is part of each employee\u2019s performance review.\n\n\u2022 For all other CEMs, the results of the risk assessment, informed by\nfeedback from leaders in Risk and Internal Audit, are a key input into\nvariable incentive compensation decisions. The results of these risk\nassessments, and associated compensation recommendations, are reviewed by a\nmanagement governance committee reporting to the HRC, and supporting steering\ncommittees, as described below. Final variable incentive compensation\ndecisions are shared with the HRC, along with the risk assessment results, as\npart of the HRC\u2019s oversight of the Company\u2019s Incentive Compensation Risk\nManagement policy and programs.\n                                                                             \n                                        The IPC is a management governance   \n                                        committee reporting to the HRC.

Over the past few\nyears the HRC made several significant enhancements to our executive\ncompensation program based on feedback from shareholders, including pay\nstructure (e.g., increased the percentage of CEO pay delivered as Performance\nShare Awards ( PSAs ); reintroduced relative Return on Tangible Common Equity\n( ROTCE ) performance) and disclosure (e.g., the performance assessment\nprocess used by the HRC, including their pay determination process), which\nhave resulted in increased support for the Company\u2019s pay program.\n                                                      \n  Select members of our Board and management engage   \n  in direct conversations with our largest            \n  institutional investors throughout the year, and    \n  we rely on these engagement sessions to understand  \n  shareholder perspectives and respond to their       \n  questions regarding the design and administration   \n  of our executive compensation program. We value     \n  shareholder feedback, and key themes are shared     \n  with the Board. Shareholder feedback served as the  \n  catalyst for the significant number of changes the  \n  HRC implemented since 2021, and is reflected in     \n  our 2023 executive compensation program. For more   \n  information, see2023 Say on Pay Vote and            \n  Shareholder Engagement.                             \n  2023 \u201cSay on Pay\u201d Proposal Vote                     \n  92% support                                         \n  shareholder support increased from                  \n  57% in 2021 and 73% in 2022                         \n  The HRC views the increased level of support we     \n  received on our 2023 \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal as       \n  confirmation that our executive compensation        \n  program is effective in addressing shareholder      \n  expectations and priorities at this point in time.  \n                                                      \nWells Fargo continues to make progress on our multi-year transformation\njourney. We remain focused on our top priority of building a risk and control\ninfrastructure appropriate for a company of our size and complexity. The\nscale and volume of the work is complex, and we are proud of the continued\nprogress that we have made over the past few years.\n\nSuccess requires that we pay for performance, promote effective risk\nmanagement, and attract and retain talent. The HRC accomplishes these\nobjectives by overseeing an executive compensation program and the underlying\nvariable compensation strategies that are strongly grounded in and reflective\nof shareholder feedback and our Labor Market Peer Group practices.

The majority of our\nexecutives\u2019 total compensation is delivered in the form of long-term equity,\nconsisting of PSAs and restricted share rights ( RSRs ), as detailed within\nthe CD&A. Our executive compensation program holds our executives accountable\nfor all aspects of the Company\u2019s performance, including making progress\ntowards the risk and control work which is the top strategic priority for\nWells Fargo, while continuing to deliver strong financial returns for our\nshareholders and supporting our customers and clients.\n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement55                                                     \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Executive Compensation                                                     \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  What We Do                            What We Avoid                        \n  Incentive compensation is variable                                         \n  and                                   No cash dividends on unearned RSRs   \n  \u201cat-risk\u201d and equity compensation     and PSAs                             \n  covers                                                                     \n  multi-year vesting periods                                                 \n                                        No pledging of Company securities    \n  Focus on risk management and risk     by directors or executive officers   \n  outcomes                              under the Board\u2019s Corporate          \n                                        Governance Guidelines                \n  Overall performance evaluated                                              \n  through a                             No executive employment agreements   \n  rigorous performance assessment                                            \n  framework                                                                  \n  Engage independent compensation       No tax gross-ups for NEOs            \n  consultant                                                                 \n                                        No additional retirement benefits    \n  Strong and independent Board          or additional years of\u00a0credited      \n  oversight                             service other than investment or     \n  through the Board\u2019s HRC               interest credits\u00a0provided under      \n                                        applicable pension plans since July  \n                                        1, 2009                              \n  Recoupment policies provide for                                            \n  clawback                                                                   \n  and forfeiture of compensation in     No repricing of stock options        \n  appropriate circumstances,            without shareholder\u00a0approval         \n  including                                                                  \n  misconduct and risk management                                             \n  failure                                                                    \n  Stock Ownership Policy includes                                            \n  minimum                                                                    \n  ownership requirements, a             No hedging of Company securities by  \n  compliance                            directors, executive officers, or    \n  period to reach requirement, and      other employees under our Code of    \n  additional holding requirements       Conduct                              \n  that                                                                       \n  extend one year after retirement.                                          \n  Year-round engagement with                                                 \n  shareholders                          No excessive perquisites for         \n  on executive compensation and         executive officers                   \n  governance                                                                 \n  issues                                                                     \n                                                                             \n2023 Performance Highlights\n\nDuring 2023, the Company delivered solid performance despite industry\nchallenges. Our solid financial performance and balance sheet enabled Wells\nFargo to be a source of strength during the regional banking crisis. We had\nstrong revenue growth including both higher net interest income and\nnoninterest income, benefiting from the impact of higher interest rates and\nthe investments we have been making in our businesses. We continued to reduce\nexpenses with lower operating losses and a continued focus on our efficiency\ninitiatives. Our capital position remained strong and we increased our\ncapital return to shareholders.\n\nWe also made progress on our risk and control work in 2023, and continued to\nadvance our business strategy, including making investments in our\nbusinesses. We are starting to see improved growth and increased market share\nin parts of the Company that we believe will drive higher returns over time.\nFor example, our new credit card products have driven an increase in consumer\nspend at a rate significantly better than the industry average, and we have\nalso been investing in Corporate and Investment Banking where revenue grew\n26% from a year ago and our investment banking and trading market shares\nincreased. The positive results in both areas were accomplished while\nmaintaining our existing risk appetite. In addition, we continued to\nstreamline and right-size the Company. This included continued execution of\nour more focused home lending strategy, actions to streamline several\nenterprise risk management programs allowing for improved integration into\nbusiness processes, and enhanced discipline to advance work on legacy issues\nand timely deliverables against regulatory commitments. Finally, we continued\nto develop innovative solutions and products for our customers, which\nincluded the full rollout of Fargo TM , our AI-powered virtual assistant that\nincludes a Spanish-language capability, launching LifeSync\u00ae, our personalized\ndigital approach to aligning customers' goals with their money, to all\nconsumer customers, launching two co-branded credit cards, and expanding the\ncapabilities of Vantage SM , our digital banking platform, to all Commercial\nBanking and Corporate and Investment Banking clients.\n\nPlease refer to 2 023 Company Performanc e for more details about the\nCompany\u2019s financial performance and how it was considered in the HRC\u2019s 2023\ncompensation decisions for the NEOs.\n                                                                             \n  56Wells Fargo & Co.                                                        \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Executive Compensation                                                     \n                                                                             \nPerformance and Compensation Determination Process\n\nConsistent with prior years, the HRC followed a systematic approach to set\ngoals, to evaluate Company, individual, and as applicable, line of business\nperformance, and to determine executive compensation. Company performance is\ndiscussed under 2023 Company Performance . Performance and compensation\nsummaries for our CEO and other NEOs begin under 2023 Named Executive Officer\nCompensation .

In referencing market data, the HRC does not target a specific\npercentile, but, instead, uses data as a reference point. Appropriate target\ncompensation levels allow the HRC to provide compensation opportunities to\nattract, motivate, and retain the most qualified senior executive leadership\nteam. In January 2023, the HRC increased target total compensation for Mr.\nSommers, reflecting the HRC\u2019s evaluation of market pay levels and a review of\nhis performance and responsibilities. Total target compensation remained\nunchanged from 2022 for the CEO and other NEOs.\n\nPay Mix\n\nAll members of the Operating Committee, including NEOs other than the CEO,\nhave a consistent variable compensation pay mix, with 70% of variable\ncompensation delivered as long-term equity. The CEO has a higher percentage,\nwith a minimum of 75% of his variable compensation delivered as long-term\nequity.\n\nPay-for-Performance Outcomes\n\nThroughout 2023, the HRC periodically assessed the Company\u2019s performance.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023 and January 2024, the HRC completed in-\ndepth reviews of all aspects of the Company\u2019s financial and non-financial\nperformance, and individual NEO performance.\n\nIn January 2024, the Board and the HRC approved the following 2023\ncompensation outcomes after assessing performance for our CEO and other NEOs,\nrespectively. Refer to 2023 Named Executive Officer Compensation for\nadditional detail on the Board\u2019s (for CEO) and HRC\u2019s evaluation of\nperformance, its actions, and the resulting pay decisions.\n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement57                                                     \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Executive Compensation                                                     \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n               2023                                                          \n  NEO          Pay\u2026                                                          \n               Out\u2026                                                          \n               Ann\u2026                                Tot\u2026    Ta\u2026               \n       Sal\u2026    Cash          PSAs          RSRs    Com\u2026    To\u2026               \n               Bon\u2026                                        Co\u2026               \n  Ch\u2026                                                                        \n  W.           $2,\u2026    $6,\u2026          $12\u2026          $6,\u2026         $29\u2026    $2\u2026  \n  Sc\u2026                                                                        \n  Mi\u2026                                                                        \n  P.           $1,\u2026    $3,\u2026          $3,\u2026          $3,\u2026         $12\u2026    $1\u2026  \n  Sa\u2026                                                                        \n  Jo\u2026                                                                        \n  G.           $1,\u2026    $3,\u2026          $4,\u2026          $4,\u2026         $14\u2026    $1\u2026  \n  We\u2026                                                                        \n  Sc\u2026                                                                        \n  E.           $1,\u2026    $2,\u2026          $3,\u2026          $3,\u2026         $11\u2026    $1\u2026  \n  Po\u2026                                                                        \n  Ba\u2026          $1,\u2026    $2,\u2026          $2,\u2026          $2,\u2026         $10\u2026    $1\u2026  \n  So\u2026                                                                        \n                                                                             \nInformation on Table Above:\n\nThe table above is not a substitute for, and should be read together with,\nthe 2023 Summary Compensation Table in this Proxy Statement.

No changes to our executive compensation program were\nmade directly as a result of our 2023 Say on Pay vote. In 2023, in response\nto shareholder feedback, the HRC completed an in-depth review of our\nFinancial Performance Peer Group, as detailed later in Peer Groups . In\naddition, the HRC continued to increase the target performance goal required\nfor three-year average absolute ROTCE performance to achieve target payout or\nabove (refer to 2024 PSA Program for details).\n\nSince our 2023 annual shareholder meeting, we engaged with institutional\ninvestors representing approximately 51% of outstanding shares.

It is embedded in the design and oversight of our\nexecutive compensation program, specifically:\n                                                                             \n                                        Providing a compelling total         \n                                        compensation opportunity consisting  \n  Providing a Competitive               of fixed and variable compensation   \n  Opportunity                           strongly tied to our long-term       \n                                        success in order to attract,         \n                                        motivate, and retain talent.         \n                                        Structuring total variable           \n                                        compensation opportunities that are  \n  Balancing Short-and Long-Term         determined annually based on our     \n  Performance                           performance, emphasizing long-term   \n                                        equity awards with future values     \n                                        that will be determined by our       \n                                        success.                             \n                                        Relying on Labor Market Peer Group   \n                                        compensation policies and practices  \n                                        as inputs in our planning processes  \n  Understanding the Market              without benchmarking any single      \n                                        compensation element or total        \n                                        compensation to a specific target    \n                                        peer percentile or pay rank.         \n                                        Being transparent to our             \n  Being Transparent to our\u00a0             shareholders in the design,          \n  Shareholders                          administration, and oversight of     \n                                        our executive compensation program,  \n                                        as appropriate.                      \n                                        Requiring our NEOs to hold a         \n                                        meaningful equity stake in the       \n                                        Company, aligning their interests    \n  Requiring Stock Ownership             with long-term shareholder           \n                                        interests and providing long-term    \n                                        accountability for effectively       \n                                        managing risk.                       \n                                        Limiting perquisites to only those   \n                                        necessary to support our NEOs in     \n  Limiting Executive Perquisites        the safe and effective discharge of  \n                                        their duties and responsibilities    \n                                        on behalf of the Company.            \n                                        Emphasizing risk balancing features  \n  Emphasizing Risk Balancing\u00a0           embedded throughout our executive    \n  Features                              compensation program, including but  \n                                        not limited to theClawback           \n                                        Policies,as applicable.              \n                                        Exercising good governance           \n                                        practices to guide the Board and     \n  Exercising Good Governance\u00a0           the HRC in their oversight of all    \n  Practices                             matters pertaining to our executive  \n                                        compensation program for our CEO     \n                                        and other NEOs, respectively.        \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement59                                                     \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Executive Compensation                                                     \n                                                                             \nPeer Groups\n\nThe HRC relies on two peer groups, the Labor Market Peer Group and the\nFinancial Performance Peer Group, in its oversight of our executive\ncompensation program. While several companies are included in both peer\ngroups, each peer group serves a separate and distinct purpose.\n\n\u2022 The Labor Market Peer Group includes our most direct competitors for\nexecutive talent, a proxy for industry compensation policies and practices,\nand an input for setting quantum of pay and pay mix. The HRC relies on this\ngroup, and guidance from Meridian, the independent compensation consultant,\nto develop an understanding of market compensation pay levels for executives\nin comparable roles, in addition to executive pay practices including program\ndesign and pay mixes. The HRC assesses peer pay levels in connection with its\nannual review of NEO compensation.\n\n\u2022 The Financial Performance Peer Group includes companies that most closely\nalign with our size, complexity, capital requirements, and degree of\nregulatory oversight (all are Global Systemically Important Banks). The HRC\u2019s\napproach in evaluating and selecting this peer group constituents reflects\nits desire to create a fair and balanced relative performance standard. It is\ncharacterized by a wide range of performance outcomes that drive pay-for-\nperformance without leading to excessive risk taking that overly aggressive\ngoals otherwise might create and reducing or eliminating the perceived value\nof PSAs, which we rely on to help us attract and retain our executives. The\nHRC relies on this group to assess our relative performance for assessing\nCompany financial performance in connection with its annual variable\ncompensation decisions and in calculating formulaic PSA payouts.\n\nThe HRC assesses the appropriateness of the peer groups each year, with input\nfrom Meridian. For 2023, this included an in-depth review of the Financial\nPerformance Peer Group in response to certain shareholders, who questioned\nthe inclusion of European banks within the Financial Performance Peer Group\nrather than US regional banks. The review considered several factors such as\nbusiness model, risk profiles and regulatory framework, including the impact\non capital and liquidity across the banks. The HRC determined to keep the\nFinancial Performance Peer Group consistent until it is able to obtain more\nclarity around Final Basel III rules, which may increase the financial\ncomparability of US regional banks and Wells Fargo. The HRC also confirmed\nthat the Labor Market peer constituents continue to represent the financial\nservices organizations with whom we compete most directly for executive\ntalent, and therefore, did not change the Labor Market Peer Group for 2024.\n\nA comparison of peer groups, sorted high to low by asset size as of December\n31, 2023, is included in the table below.\n                                                                             \n               Labor     Financial        Assets      Revenue    Market Cap  \n  Company      Market    Performa\u2026         ($ in        ($ in         ($ in  \n                                       millions)    millions)     millions)  \n  JPMorgan     \u2b24         \u2b24            $3,875,393     $158,104      $491,761  \n  Chase*                                                                     \n  Bank of      \u2b24         \u2b24            $3,179,876      $98,581      $266,455  \n  America*                                                                   \n  HSBC                                                                       \n  Holdings               \u2b24            $3,038,677      $66,058      $153,686  \n  plc*                                                                       \n  BNP                                                                        \n  Paribas                \u2b24            $2,860,756      $50,640       $79,415  \n  S.A.*                                                                      \n  Citigroup    \u2b24         \u2b24            $2,405,306      $78,462       $98,450  \n  Inc.*                                                                      \n  Banco                                                                      \n  Santande\u2026              \u2b24            $1,983,777      $63,389       $66,353  \n  S.A.*                                                                      \n  Wells                               $1,932,468      $82,597      $178,749  \n  Fargo*                                                                     \n  Barclays               \u2b24            $1,883,369      $32,349       $29,632  \n  PLC*                                                                       \n  UBS Group              \u2b24            $1,717,569      $40,834      $100,216  \n  AG*1                                                                       \n  Goldman      \u2b24         \u2b24            $1,642,000      $46,254      $132,489  \n  Sachs*                                                                     \n  Royal                                                                      \n  Bank of                \u2b24            $1,514,573      $42,400      $142,715  \n  Canada*2                                                                   \n  Morgan       \u2b24         \u2b24            $1,193,693      $54,143      $153,052  \n  Stanley*                                                                   \n  US           \u2b24                        $663,491      $28,144       $67,387  \n  Bancorp                                                                    \n  PNC          \u2b24                        $561,580      $21,490       $61,683  \n  BNY          \u2b24                        $409,953      $17,502       $40,030  \n  Mellon*                                                                    \n  State        \u2b24                        $297,258      $11,945       $23,903  \n  Street*                                                                    \n  American     \u2b24                        $261,000      $60,515      $136,523  \n  Express                                                                    \n                                                                             \n* Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs).\n\n1.

Assessment and Variable Compensation Determination Process\n\n2023 Process\n\nThe HRC assesses NEO performance through evaluation against pre-established\nfinancial and non-financial goals. This includes consideration of financial\nresults and progress against strategic priorities, providing the flexibility\nto assess both quantitative and qualitative results. This process aligns\nvariable compensation determinations with performance against the Company\u2019s\nlong-term value drivers and prudent risk oversight, and provides the HRC with\nthe ability to reduce an individual NEO\u2019s performance achievement level for\nmaterial failures in risk management, including but not limited to\nmisconduct. The HRC believes that using a single formula to evaluate\nperformance and determine compensation is not practical and may not fully\nreflect the scope and complexity of our business and the regulatory risks and\nother non-financial outcomes that impact our Company success. This rigorous\nprocess enables the HRC to evaluate Company, CEO, and each of our other NEO\u2019s\noverall performance, which serves as the basis for compensation decisions, as\ndescribed in more detail below.\n\n1 Set Goals\n\nOur Board sets our strategic direction and risk appetite, including approval\nof our strategic plan annually which includes our five strategic pillars. The\nfive strategic pillars are used to frame the goals the HRC uses to assess\nCompany, individual, and, as applicable, line of business performance. Three\nof the strategic pillars \u2013 Risk and Control Culture, Operational Excellence,\nand Customer-Centric Culture and Conduct \u2013 focus on advancing our risk and\ncontrol culture, supported by Technology and Innovation (4th pillar), to\ncollectively drive our top priority of building a risk and control\ninfrastructure appropriate for our size and complexity, and Financial\nStrength (5th pillar).\n\nAt the beginning of each year, individual NEO goals are set tailored to their\narea of responsibility with a focus on supporting broader Company goals. For\n2023, consistent with 2022, the strategic pillars, Company, and individual\nNEO goals are broadly categorized below:\n                                                                             \n  Strategic Pillars        Company Goals             Individual/Line of      \n                                                     Business* Goals         \n                           \u2022Risk, Regulatory, &                              \n                           Control                                           \n  \u2022Risk & Control          \u2022Financial                \u2022Risk, Regulatory, &    \n  Culture                  \u2022Operational              Control                 \n  \u2022Operational             Excellence                \u2022Financial              \n  Excellence               \u2022Customer-Centric         \u2022Strategy, Technology,  \n  \u2022Customer-Centric        Culture &\u00a0Conduct         &\u00a0innovation            \n  Culture &\u00a0Conduct        \u2022Technology &             \u2022Talent, Leadership, &  \n  \u2022Technology &            Innovation                Culture (including      \n  Innovation               \u2022ESG (including DE&I      DE&I)                   \n  \u2022Financial Strength      and Community                                     \n                           Engagement)                                       \n                           \u2022Talent & Leadership                              \n                                                                             \n* Line of Business Goals are included for CEOs of each business line.\n\n2 Evaluate Performance\n\nThe HRC assesses performance holistically and regularly monitors and reviews\nCompany performance throughout the year. At the end of the year, the HRC (and\nthe Board for the CEO) assesses Company and individual NEO performance\nagainst the financial and non-financial goals set at the beginning of the\nyear, in addition to risk performance informed by the Chief Risk Officer (\nCRO ) (see Independent Risk Assessment below for details). The outcome of the\nperformance evaluation is directly used to determine NEO variable\ncompensation.\n                                                                             \n  62Wells Fargo & Co.                                                        \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Executive Compensation                                                     \n                                                                             \nSimilar to last year, the HRC focused on our NEOs\u2019 progress in: strengthening\nour risk and control infrastructure, which includes addressing open\nhistorical and emerging issues; and advancing our business through technology\nand innovation to increase internal operational efficiency so we can deploy\nresources to better serve our customers and communities. We anticipate that\nthe HRC\u2019s focus on these two areas will continue for the foreseeable future\nto help drive the Company\u2019s transformation.\n\nHRC\u2019s Evaluation Process:\n                                                                             \n  CEO                                                                        \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n                                                     The HRC approves CEO    \n  The CEO completes a      The HRC assesses the      compensation with a     \n  self-assessment of       CEO's performance in      recommendation to the   \n  his performance which    an executive session      Board.

During this process, the CRO assesses the extent of each NEO\u2019s\n(other than the CEO) involvement in and accountability (if any) related to\nrisk events that took place, or were identified, during the year. For the\nCEO, the HRC conducts a risk assessment with input from the Risk Committee\nChair (who is also a member of the HRC), as well as the CRO. Further, each\nNEO is assessed on driving measurable progress towards advancing the\nCompany\u2019s risk and control environment, which includes resolving outstanding\nregulatory matters and commitments. The risk assessments are incorporated\ninto each NEO\u2019s overall performance assessment, and the HRC may reduce or\neliminate an NEO\u2019s variable compensation for the applicable performance year\ndue to risk failures, as well as take other actions under the Company\u2019s\nClawback Policies depending on the nature and impact of adverse risk\noutcomes.\n\n3 Determine Variable Compensation\n\nThe HRC utilizes a structured approach to determine each NEO\u2019s variable\ncompensation. Under this approach, Company and individual NEO achievement\nlevels, including line of business performance (as applicable), and risk\nconsiderations are evaluated by the HRC to determine total performance\nachievement. CEO and other NEO variable compensation is then determined using\neach NEO\u2019s target variable compensation and total achievement level, with\npotential adjustments for the other NEOs based on progress on diverse\nrepresentation and inclusion across specific groups of NEO senior leadership\nteams. The total variable compensation process is illustrated below.\n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement63                                                     \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Executive Compensation                                                     \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Total Performance                                                          \n  Achievement %           X    Target                   =    Total Variable  \n  (see weightings              VariableCompensation          Compensation    \n  below)                                                                     \n                                                                             \nTotal Performance Achievement % Weightings:\n                                                                             \n                        Company %    Individual %    Business Line %(as      \n                                                     applicable)             \n  CEO                   65%          35%             N/A                     \n  Functional NEOs       50%          50%             N/A                     \n  Business Line CEOs    30%          50%             20%                     \n                                                                             \nOnce the total variable compensation is determined, it is delivered through a\npre-set pay mix.

The HRC believed it was\nuseful to consider adjustments for notable items that occurred during 2023\nand 2022 to better assess the Company\u2019s underlying financial performance for\n2023, including as compared with 2022.\n\nNotable items included the following: (i) the FDIC special assessment of $1.9\nbillion (pre-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2023, and (ii) operating losses\nrelated to litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters related\nto a variety of historical matters of $2.0 billion (pre-tax) and $3.3 billion\n(pre-tax) in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, respectively. The\nlitigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters in the third and\nfourth quarters of 2022 included amounts related to the December 2022 CFPB\nconsent order and the further refinement of the scope of customer remediation\nfor historical mortgage lending, automobile lending, and consumer deposit\naccounts matters.

Despite the improved performance of the Company and the\nsignificant progress made, Mr. Scharf continues to believe negative\ndiscretion is appropriate to emphasize that more work remains ahead.\n\nThe HRC agreed and recommended to the Board total compensation of $29\nmillion, which is lower than the $30.3 million that would have otherwise been\ndelivered under the executive compensation program.

In addition, the HRC\nrecognized Mr. Weiss\u2019 leadership across several strategic priorities, which\nincluded: refining and executing against CIB\u2019s long-term business plan,\nincluding demonstrating an appropriate balance between risk and return during\nuse of company balance sheet; filling key leadership roles to position CIB\nfor growth; driving action and accountability to advance the risk and control\nenvironment, including aligning appropriate resources and support to\nexecution of regulatory deliverables; and advancing DE&I and ESG priorities.\n                                                                             \n  2023 Total Variable Compensation                                           \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  \u2026               B\u2026               I\u2026               T\u2026         \u2026         T\u2026  \n  \u2026               P\u2026               P\u2026               P\u2026         \u2026         V\u2026  \n                                                    A\u2026         \u2026         C\u2026  \n  \u2026    A\u2026         W\u2026    A\u2026         W\u2026    A\u2026                                  \n  \u2026               2\u2026               5\u2026                                        \n  x          +    x           +    x           =    1\u2026    x    \u2026    =    $\u2026  \n  \u2026               1\u2026               1\u2026                                        \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  74Wells Fargo & Co.                                                        \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Executive Compensation                                                     \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Scott E.

2023, compared to prior year target total\ncompensation of $9 million. The HRC, in determining Mr. Sommers\u2019 individual\nperformance achievement level of 100%, and business performance achievement\nof 100%, evaluated WIM\u2019s financial performance and Mr. Sommers\u2019 non-financial\nperformance. In particular, the HRC considered WIM\u2019s growth in client assets,\nimproved return on allocated capital, and increase in noninterest expense due\nto higher revenue-related compensation, severance expense and operating\ncosts, partially offset by the impact of efficiency initiatives. In addition,\nthe HRC recognized Mr. Sommers\u2019 leadership across several strategic\npriorities, which included: driving change for a simplified WIM operating\nmodel to create a more streamlined and client focused organization, with\nimprovements in advisor and client experience; focus on attracting financial\nadvisor talent; continuing to drive focus on risk and regulatory environment\nto execute against top priorities; and continuing to advance the Company\u2019s\nDE&I priorities.\n                                                                             \n  2023 Total Variable Compensation                                           \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  \u2026               B\u2026               I\u2026               T\u2026         \u2026         T\u2026  \n  \u2026               P\u2026               P\u2026               P\u2026         \u2026         V\u2026  \n                                                    A\u2026         \u2026         C\u2026  \n  \u2026    A\u2026         W\u2026    A\u2026         W\u2026    A\u2026                                  \n  \u2026               2\u2026               5\u2026                                        \n  x          +    x           +    x           =    1\u2026    x    \u2026    =    $\u2026  \n  \u2026               1\u2026               1\u2026                                        \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  78Wells Fargo & Co.                                                        \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Executive Compensation                                                     \n                                                                             \nLong-Term Equity Compensation\n\nLong-Term Equity\n\nSimilar to the annual cash bonus determination, long-term equity awards are\ndetermined as a percentage of total variable compensation. The HRC grants\nPSAs and RSRs to promote long-term performance and risk accountability. These\nobjectives are achieved by subjecting long-term equity awards to our Clawback\nPolicies , as applicable. The value ultimately realized from any long-term\nequity grant is also a function of the number of shares that vest and our\nstock price at the time of vesting and settlement. Finally, PSAs carry\nadditional performance requirements tied to our absolute and relative ROTCE\nand a TSR modifier based on our performance relative to our Financial\nPerformance Peer Group over a three-year performance period.\n\nConsistent with last year, absolute and relative ROTCE are the primary\nperformance conditions in our PSAs. Effective for PSAs granted in 2024 for\n2023 performance, the HRC again increased the absolute ROTCE performance\nrequired to achieve the target and maximum payout levels. Finally, the HRC\ncontinued to apply an award payout modifier of +/-20% based on our relative\nTSR over the three-year performance period. The TSR modifier has been\nincluded in PSAs granted since 2022 and supports management accountability\nfor our relative stock price performance at the end of the performance period\nfor which an award is earned.\n\n2024 PSA Program\n\nOur PSA program appropriately balances the importance of absolute and\nrelative performance while maintaining rigorous performance targets. The key\nfeatures of our 2024 PSA program, for the awards granted in 2024 for 2023\nperformance, include:\n                                                                             \n

Adjustments were\nmade in accordance with the Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan and\napplicable award agreement. For 2021, Company performance was adjusted for\nreversals of credit loss reserves taken in 2020. For 2022, Company\nperformance was adjusted for operating losses in the third and fourth\nquarters of 2022. For 2023, Company performance was adjusted for the FDIC\nspecial assessment. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the offer letter,\nthe ROTCE results for PSAs awarded to Mr. Scharf were also adjusted to\nexclude the impact of any penalties or other charges related to litigation,\ninvestigations, or examinations arising out of retail sales practices of the\nCompany, or arising out of other material regulatory matters related to the\nconduct of the Company, in each case during periods prior to Mr. Scharf\u2019s\ncommencement of employment with Wells Fargo. Based on this analysis, the HRC\ncertified payout at 137% of target for each of our NEOs.\n                                                                             \n  80Wells Fargo & Co.                                                        \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Executive Compensation                                                     \n                                                                             \nCompensation Policies and Practices\n                                                                             \n   Risk Management and Accountability                                        \n                                                                             \nOur executive compensation program reinforces effective risk management\nthrough risk-balancing features that discourage and mitigate excessive risk-\ntaking and an accountability framework that, under defined conditions,\nenables the reduction, forfeiture, or clawback of compensation in the event\nNEOs\u2019 actions, or inactions, result in specified negative outcomes for our\nCompany.\n\nTo discourage imprudent risk-taking, the Company has embedded risk-balancing\nfeatures throughout our executive compensation program.

and\n\n\u2022 Create meaningful accountability for effective risk management since vested\nand unvested long-term stock awards are subject to forfeiture or clawback.\n                                                                             \n                                        Retention                            \n                                        Requirement                          \n  Executive          Minimum            Until minimum       After minimum    \n  officer            ownership level    level is\u00a0met        level is met     \n  CEO                6x base salary     75% of net          50% of net       \n                                        vested shares       vested shares    \n  Other NEOs         3x base salary     75% of net          50% of net       \n                                        vested shares       vested shares    \n                                                                             \nShares counted toward ownership include shares owned outright, as well as\nshares (and share equivalents) held in the Company 401(k) Plan, Supplemental\n401(k) Plan, Deferred Compensation Plan, Direct Purchase and Dividend\nReinvestment Plan, and shares owned by an executive officer\u2019s spouse. In\naddition, 50% of unvested RSRs and target PSAs count toward ownership, which\nwe believe supports a comprehensive assessment of our long-term equity\nstrategy against the previously identified principles.\n\nTo further enhance the effectiveness of the Stock Ownership Policy, the HRC\nadded a five-year compliance period. NEOs must attain their minimum ownership\nlevel within five full calendar years from the later of the effective date of\nthe policy or appointment to an executive officer role. Compliance with these\nstock ownership requirements is calculated annually and reported to the HRC.\n\nThe retention requirement applies to each of the NEOs for the duration of\ntheir time as an executive officer and for one year after retirement. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, all NEOs were in compliance with the Stock Ownership\nPolicy.\n\nClawback Policies\n\nThe Company\u2019s Clawback and Forfeiture Policy ( Policy ) is designed to\nencourage the creation of long-term, sustainable performance and to\ndiscourage our NEOs from taking unnecessary or inappropriate risks that would\nnegatively impact our Company or harm our customers. The Policy enables the\nHRC and the Board to hold NEOs accountable:\n\n\u2022 During and immediately prior to vesting when risk-based performance and\nother considerations can reduce or eliminate the number of shares ultimately\nearned.\n\n\u2022 Subsequent to vesting when shares earned remain subject to clawback.\n\nA summary of the compensation-related actions the Company can take under the\nPolicy is set forth below:\n                                                                             \n  Trigger          Description        Compensation      Clawback    Forfeit  \n

payment(s) have taken place within five\nyears from when the HRC approves a clawback.\n\nIn 2023, the HRC approved the Mandatory Clawback Policy, as required under\nRule 10D-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The policy provides for\nthe recoupment of erroneously awarded excess incentive-based compensation in\nthe event of certain accounting restatements and applies to both current and\nformer Section 16 officers.\n\nDeferred Compensation and Other Benefits\n\nNEOs are eligible to participate in the same benefit programs generally\navailable to all employees, including health, disability, and other benefits,\nand our Company 401(k) plan. Our Company matched up to 6% of eligible 401(k)\nPlan participants\u2019 certified compensation (subject to Internal Revenue\nService ( IRS ) limits) during 2023.\n\nNEOs and certain other highly compensated team members are also eligible to\nparticipate in our Deferred Compensation Plan. This plan provides for\nsupplemental Company matching contributions for any compensation deferred\ninto the plan in excess of the IRS limits that apply to the 401(k) Plan by\nparticipants, that otherwise would have been eligible for a matching\ncontribution under our Company\u2019s 401(k) Plan.\n\nThe HRC believes these programs are similar to, and competitive with, those\noffered by our Labor Market Peer Group. We provide information about the\nbenefits under these plans in the Summary Compensation and Non-Qualified\nDeferred Compensation tables and related narrative.\n\nPerquisites\n\nThe HRC has intentionally limited perquisites for our NEOs. The HRC may\napprove security measures, including residential physical and cyber security\nsystems and services, if determined to be in the business interests of our\nCompany for the safety and security of our executives and our Company\u2019s\ninformation. The Company determined that, for security purposes, Mr. Scharf,\nour CEO, should implement and maintain residential physical and cyber\nsecurity and the Company has agreed to pay for such security. The Company has\nalso provided each other NEO a $50,000 one-time allowance for purposes of\nassessing and implementing residential physical and cyber security\nimprovements and $5,000 annually for ongoing maintenance of residential\nphysical and cyber security systems. Based upon a security assessment\nconducted in 2022 by an independent security consultant with respect to the\nCEO, the Company also determined that, for security purposes, Mr. Scharf, our\nCEO, should avoid traveling by commercial ground transport or aircraft. We\nprovide a car and driver to Mr. Scharf for business travel, commuting, and\npersonal use. Mr. Scharf has agreed to reimburse us for the incremental cost\nof any use of the car and driver other than for business travel and\ncommuting. In addition, the HRC has approved Mr. Scharf\u2019s use of the\ncorporate aircraft for personal flights in an amount of incremental cost not\nto exceed $200,000 annually. Mr. Scharf has agreed to reimburse us for the\nincremental cost of his personal use of the corporate aircraft which exceeds\nthis $200,000 annual limit. We may pay the cost for a NEO\u2019s spouse to\naccompany the NEO on business-related travel, typically to attend a Wells\nFargo business-related event where spousal attendance is expected or\ncustomary.\n\nOther Compensation\n\nAs part of our efforts to build out the senior management team and to attract\nand retain top executive talent, we may provide sign-on bonuses and buy-out\nequity awards for new hires. New hire sign-on bonuses and buy-out equity\nawards are an effective means of making up for compensation opportunities\nexecutives forfeit when they leave a former employer to join the Company. We\ntypically require executives to return all or a portion of their sign-on\nbonus if, within a certain period after joining us, they voluntarily leave\nthe Company or are involuntarily terminated by the Company for cause. New\nhire equity awards are used to incentivize executives to join without\nunnecessarily increasing annual compensation levels. These awards are\ngenerally subject to a time-based vesting period and such other terms and\nconditions as the HRC determines to be appropriate.\n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement83                                                     \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Executive Compensation                                                     \n                                                                             \nCompensation Governance Oversight\n\nThe HRC believes that strong governance and oversight of our executive\ncompensation program is essential to the Company\u2019s long-term success. To\nachieve this, the HRC is comprised of independent directors with human\ncapital risk and human capital management experience and qualifications. They\nare informed by an independent compensation consultant, to make compensation\ndecisions based on NEO performance and comparison of Labor Market Peer Group\nexecutive pay levels and pay practices, based on discussions throughout the\nyear (in both regularly scheduled meetings and special meetings, as\nappropriate). Refer to the Human Resources Committee, within Board Committee\nMembers and Oversight Responsibilities , for a list of key HRC oversight\nresponsibilities and number of meetings each year.\n\nDefining

management or Board\napproval. For 2023, the HRC retained an independent compensation consultant,\nMeridian, to provide independent advice on executive compensation matters and\nadvise on the design and disclosure of the compensation elements.\n\nOn an annual basis, the HRC reviews the services performed by, and the fees\npaid to Meridian. Upon conducting this review, the HRC determined that\nMeridian does no other work for our Company or management other than to\nprovide consulting services to the GNC, HRC, and Board that are directly\nrelated to employee and non-employee director compensation. To help maintain\nthe independence of any consultant retained by the HRC, the HRC is required\nunder its charter to pre-approve all services performed for our Company by\nMeridian, other than the services performed for the GNC with respect to non-\nemployee director compensation. The HRC assessed Meridian\u2019s independence\nconsidering the NYSE listing standards and SEC rules and concluded that no\nconflict of interest or independence concerns exist.\n\nCompensation Committee Report\n\nIn its capacity as the compensation committee of our Board, the HRC has\nreviewed and discussed with management the CD&A that immediately precedes\nthis report. Based on this review and these discussions, the HRC has\nrecommended to our Board that the CD&A be included in this Proxy Statement\nand incorporated by reference in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023, for filing with the SEC.\n                                                                             \n  Members of the Human Resources Committee                                   \n                                                                             \nRonald L.

Under the applicable Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )\nAccounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 718 rules, the amount\nincluded in column (e) above for 2023 represents the fair value of the 2023\nPSA or RSR award on its \u201cgrant date\u201d (i.e., the date the HRC approved each\naward), based (i) for a PSA upon the then-probable outcome of the ROTCE\nperformance condition (i.e., the target value of the award), and (ii) for an\nRSR award upon the full number of shares subject to the award. See Notes 1\nand 12 to our 2023 financial statements included in Exhibit 13 to our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 regarding\nassumptions underlying the valuation of these awards.\n\nAccordingly, the amount shown for 2023 in column (e) for 2023 PSAs is the\nfair value of the named executive\u2019s award on the date of grant, calculated by\nmultiplying the target number of shares subject to the award by the NYSE\nclosing price per share on that date. The amount shown for 2023 in column (e)\nfor RSRs was calculated by multiplying the number of shares subject to the\nawards by the NYSE closing price per share on the date of grant.\n\n2. The PSAs included in column (e) for 2023 and discussed above are (i)\nsubject to adjustment for each named executive upward (to a maximum of 150%\nof the target award) or downward (to zero), depending upon the achievement of\ncertain absolute and relative performance conditions based on the average of\nour ROTCE for the three fiscal years ending on December 31, 2023, 2024, and\n2025, (ii) modified by +/- 20% if the Company\u2019s relative TSR for the\nperformance period is in the top quartile or bottom quartile, respectively,\n(iii) subject to further downward adjustment by 1/3 in the event our Company\nincurs a NOL for any year in the three-year performance period, and (iv)\nsubject to forfeiture of the awards.\n\nAssuming (1) that our Company\u2019s performance during the measurement period for\nthe 2023 PSAs results in the maximum number of PSAs vesting, and (2) the HRC\ndoes not exercise discretion to cause the forfeiture of the PSAs, the NEOs\nwould be entitled to receive the number of PSAs having the related fair value\nshown after his or her name: Mr Scharf - 364,866 PSAs, $16,218,294; Mr.\nSantomassimo - 124,002 PSAs, $5,511,889; Mr. Weiss - 150,618 PSAs,\n$6,694,970; Mr. Powell - 97,515 PSAs, $4,334,542; Mr. Sommers - 99,844 PSAs,\n$4,438,066.\n\nAdditional information about the PSAs and other awards appears in our CD&A\nand in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table, footnotes, and related\nnarrative.\n\n3. Amounts shown in column (f) for 2023 reflect annual incentive non-equity\nawards made to each NEO in February 2024 based on 2023 performance.\n\n4. As of December 31, 2023, Mr. Weiss was the only NEO to experience an\nincrease in the actuarial present value of his pension benefit under our Cash\nBalance Plan from December 31, 2022. The actuarial present value of Mr.\nWeiss\u2019s pension benefit under our Cash Balance Plan increased by $12,801. All\nbenefits under this plan were frozen in July 2009, and no additional\nretirement benefit has accrued to any named executive since that date. We are\nrequired by SEC rules to show the change in the amount included in column (g)\ngenerally using the same actuarial method and assumptions we use for\nfinancial accounting purposes to calculate the current value of a future\npension benefit payout as described in footnote (2) to the 2023 Pension\nBenefits table below.

Effective July 1, 2009, we froze the Wells Fargo Cash Balance Plan ( Cash\nBalance Plan ) and also merged the Wachovia Corporation Pension Plan (\nWachovia Pension Plan ), in which Mr. Weiss participated, into the Cash\nBalance Plan. Mr. Weiss\u2019 years of service after 2009 are not counted as\ncredited service under the Cash Balance Plan.\n\n2. The amounts shown in column (d) are determined as of December 31, 2023 and\nrepresent the present value of Mr. Weiss\u2019s accrued retirement benefits under\nthe Cash Balance Plan as of December 31, 2023, discounted to that date using\nthe same assumptions and accounting policies (ASC 715) that we used to\ncompute our benefit obligations under the plan in our financial statements,\nexcept that we made no assumption for death or termination of employment of\nNEOs prior to normal retirement age (age 65). Additional information about\nMr. Weiss\u2019s pension benefit is provided below under Description of Pension\nPlans .\n\n3. A description of the accounting policies, actuarial, and other assumptions\nwe used to compute these benefits, except as noted above and for the use of\nage 65 as the \u201cnormal retirement age,\u201d can be found under Notes 1 and 22 to\nour 2023 financial statements included in Exhibit 13 to our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

On July 1, 2009, the Cash Balance Plan\nwas frozen. As a result of the merger and this freeze, no additional\nretirement benefits or additional years of credited service have accrued\nsince this date. The NEO\u2019s benefit will be paid to him from the Cash Balance\nPlan upon retirement.

The\nDeferred Compensation Plan also provides for supplemental Company-matching\ncontributions related to any compensation deferred by a plan participant,\nincluding named executives, that would have been eligible (up to certain IRS\nlimits) but for this deferral, for a matching contribution under the 401(k)\nPlan. As of December 31, 2023, none of our NEOs were participating in the\nDeferred Compensation Plan.\n\nWachovia Elective Deferral Plan and Wachovia Savings Restoration Plan\n\nAs a former Wachovia executive, Mr. Weiss participated in the Wachovia\nElective Deferral Plan and the Wachovia Savings Restoration Plan.\nParticipation in these plans was frozen and contributions ceased for the\nWachovia Elective Deferral Plan, effective December 31, 2008, and for the\nWachovia Savings Restoration Plan, effective December 31, 2007.\n\nThe Wachovia Elective Deferral Plan is a frozen, unfunded, nonqualified\ndeferred compensation plan that allowed certain highly compensated employees\nto defer base salary and/or incentive payments on a pre-tax basis until a\nfuture date (generally retirement, death, or separation from service). The\nterms of the plan required participants to irrevocably elect the form of\npayment (either in installments or in a lump sum) and permitted early\nwithdrawal of account balances in the case of an unforeseeable emergency\nresulting in severe financial hardship. In addition, participant salary\ndeferral amounts were subject to a Company match in certain circumstances.\n\nThe Wachovia Savings Restoration Plan is a frozen, unfunded, nonqualified\ndeferred compensation plan that previously provided for pre-tax deferral\ncontributions to restore Wachovia 401(k) Plan contributions beyond the IRS\nqualified plan contribution limitations. Employees with an annual base salary\ngreater than Internal Revenue Code annual covered compensation limits were\neligible to participate and could elect to contribute up to 30% of base\nsalary. Wachovia matched participants\u2019 contributions on a dollar-for-dollar\nbasis up to 6% of base salary. Participants elected, at the time they joined\nthe plan, the timing of the payment of their account balances (on or after\nfive years of participation, or upon separation or retirement), as well as\nthe form and term of payment of their accounts (lump sum or 10 annual\ninstallments), and may petition for, and receive an early distribution of,\ntheir account balances in the event of an unforeseeable emergency causing\nsevere financial hardship.\n\nParticipants are entitled to invest all or a portion of their deferral\naccounts in one or more investment options available under the plans, which\ngenerally mirror those offered in the Wachovia 401(k) Plan, and to receive\nthe earnings on the deferred amounts based on those investment elections upon\ndistribution of the deferral accounts, subject to income tax withholding.\n                                                                             \n  92Wells Fargo & Co.                                                        \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Executive Compensation                                                     \n                                                                             \nPotential Post-Employment Payments\n\nWe do not have employment or other severance agreements with our NEOs. The\ntable below shows estimated post-employment payments for our NEOs, assuming\nthey had terminated employment on December 31, 2023. To estimate the payment\namounts for each NEO, we used the closing price of our common stock on\nDecember 29, 2023 of $49.22.\n\nThe following items are not included in the table or description below:\n\n\u2022 Retirement benefits under our Cash Balance Plan, which are described above\nunder 2023 Pension Benefits .\n\n\u2022 Distributions of balances under our deferred compensation plans, which\nbalances are shown in the 2023 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table\nabove.\n\n\u2022 Payments and benefits provided on a nondiscriminatory basis to employees\nupon termination of employment. These include accrued salary and accrued but\nunused paid time off, severance payments under our Severance Plan,\ndistributions of plan balances under our 401(k) Plan, and welfare benefits\nprovided to all retirees, including access to unsubsidized retiree medical\ninsurance. If eligible under the Severance Plan, employees receive post-\ntermination severance payments based on no more than $350,000 annual salary\nfor 8 to 52 weeks depending on the number of completed years of service. If\nterminated as described below under Estimated Post-Employment Payments and\neligible for the Severance Plan, our NEOs would receive the following\naggregate amount under the Severance Plan, as of December 31, 2023: Mr.\nScharf - $53,846; Mr. Santomassimo - $53,846; Mr. Weiss - $242,308; Mr.\nPowell - $53,846; Mr. Sommers - $53,846.\n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement93                                                     \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Executive Compensation                                                     \n                                                                             \nEstimated Post-Employment Payments 1\n                                                                             \n                                   Type of                                   \n                               Terminatio\u2026                                   \n                                                                 Disabilit\u2026  \n                                                                 Involunta\u2026  \n                                                                 Due to      \n                                                                 Displacem\u2026  \n                                                                 Divestitu\u2026  \n  Name          Type of                     Death                or          \n                Payment                     ($)                  Affiliate   \n                                                                 Change in   \n                                                                 Control;    \n                                                                 or          \n                                                                 Retirement  \n                                                                 ($)         \n  Charles W.

The values shown in the table for the RSRs include the value of the 2021\nPSAs, for which the performance period was completed on December 31, 2023.\nFor the 2022 and 2023 PSAs, (i) for death, awards are valued at target\npursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreements; and (ii) for\ndisability, certain involuntary terminations, or voluntary retirement, awards\nare valued at the maximum level of performance achievement as of December 31,\n2023. However, because the applicable performance period for each of these\nawards has not yet been completed, the actual number of 2022 and 2023 PSAs\nearned will depend on our Company\u2019s level of ROTCE performance and TSR\nperformance over the performance period for each award including reduction\nfor NOL, forfeiture provisions, and compliance with covenants.

Under the LTICP, certain involuntary terminations include terminations due\nto displacement and receipt of a lump sum severance benefit, placement on a\nleave that results in receipt of severance benefits, or termination\nassociated with an affiliate change in control. Under the LTICP, retirement\ngenerally occurs when an NEO has reached the earliest of (a) age 55 with 10\ncompleted years of service, (b) 80 points (with one point credited for each\ncompleted age year and one point credited for each completed year of\nservice); or (c) age 65. As of December 31, 2023, none of our NEOs, other\nthan Mr. Weiss met this definition of retirement. For Mr. Scharf, retirement\nmeans the termination of employment (i) after reaching age 55 with five\ncompleted years of service or (ii) based on such more favorable treatment as\nmay apply under the practices of the Company in effect from time to time. As\nof December 31, 2023, Mr. Scharf did not meet this definition of retirement.\n\n5. Under the LTIP, effective April 2022, certain involuntary terminations\ninclude terminations due to displacement and receipt of a lump sum severance\nbenefit, placement on a leave that results in receipt of severance benefits,\nor a termination associated with an affiliate change in control. Under the\nLTIP, retirement generally occurs when a named executive has reached the\nearliest of (a) age 55 with 5 completed years of service or (b) 80 points\n(with one point credited for each completed age year and one point credited\nfor each completed year of service). As of December 31, 2023, none of our\nNEOs, other than Mr. Weiss met this definition of retirement.\n\nUnder our Chair/CEO Post-Retirement Policy, Mr. Scharf is entitled to\nreceive, for two years following his retirement, subject to approval of our\nBoard and HRC, office space, administrative assistance, and a part-time\ndriver, provided he remains available for management consultation and\ncontinues to represent us with our customers, community, and employees during\nthis period. The value of benefits provided under this policy would depend on\nMr. Scharf\u2019s use of the same.\n\nWe are currently required to receive regulatory non-objection before we agree\nto or make a post-employment payment to certain named executives unless an\nexception applies. Accordingly, if a covered NEO terminates employment when\nthis requirement is in place, then any of the post-employment payments\ndescribed above will require regulatory non-objection unless an exception\napplies.\n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement95                                                     \n                                                                             \nTable of Contents\n\nCEO Pay Ratio and Median Employee Annual Total Compensation\n\nCEO Pay Ratio\n\nFor 2023, the annual total compensation of Mr. Scharf, our CEO, was\n$25,966,198, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table. The estimated\nannual total compensation of the median Wells Fargo employee (other than our\nCEO) was $80,012. As such, our CEO\u2019s total annual compensation was\napproximately 325 times that of the estimated annual total compensation of\nthe median Wells Fargo employee in 20 23.\n                                                                          \n  CEO annual total compensation                       $25,966,198         \n  Median Employee estimated annual total                  $80,012         \n  compensation                                                            \n  Ratio of CEO annual total compensation to Median                 325:1  \n  Employee estimated annual total compensation                            \n                                                                          \nMedian Employee Total Annual Compensation Methodology\n\nTo identify the estimated total annual compensation of the median Wells Fargo\nemployee other than our CEO:\n\n\u2022 We prepared a database including the total gross amount of salary, wages,\nand other non-equity compensation (which depending on the individual could\ninclude items such as holiday and other paid time off, overtime pay, shift\ndifferentials), as reflected in our payroll records for 2023, for our global\nworkforce (other than our CEO) as of December 31, 2023. As needed, amounts\nwere converted from local currency to U.S. dollars.\n\n\u2022 We annualized the compensation of all permanent employees who were newly\nhired during 2023.\n\n\u2022 We calculated the median gross pay (as described in the first bullet above)\nand selected the employee that made up the median. In addition to the\nemployee that made up the median, we selected four employees immediately\nabove and four employees immediately below to further analyze.\n\n\u2022 For the nine employees, we combined all of the elements of each employee\u2019s\ncompensation for 2023 to calculate total compensation with the same\nmethodology used to calculate the \u201cTotal\u201d column of the 2023 Summary\nCompensation Table in accordance with SEC rules and regulations.\n\nThe pay ratio reported above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner\nconsistent with SEC rules based on our internal records and the methodology\ndescribed above. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated\nemployee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee\u2019s total annual\ncompensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply\ncertain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that\nreflect their employee populations and compensation practices. Therefore, the\npay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio\nreported above, as other companies have different employee populations and\ncompensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions,\nestimates, and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.\n                                                                             \n  96Wells Fargo & Co.                                                        \n                                                                             \nTable of Contents Pay Versus Performance As required by Section 953(a) of the\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(v) of\nRegulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the\nrelationship between executive \u201ccompensation actually paid\u201d and certain\nfinancial performance of the Company.

Cumulative TSR is calculated by dividing the sum of the cumulative amount\nof dividends for the measurement period, assuming dividend reinvestment, and\nthe difference between the Company\u2019s share price at the end of each fiscal\nyear shown and the beginning of the measurement period by the Company\u2019s share\nprice at the beginning of the measurement period. The beginning of the\nmeasurement period for each year in the table is the closing price on\nDecember 31, 2019. 6. The peer group used for this purpose is the KBW Nasdaq\nBank Index. In the 2023 proxy statement, TSR for 2020, 2021, and 2022 was\ncalculated based on the underlying companies that make up the KBW Nasdaq Bank\nIndex. TSR has been updated for 2020, 2021, 2022, and calculated for 2023\nusing the actual KBW Nasdaq Bank Index. The calculation produces deminimis\nchanges for 2020, 2021, and 2022 as compared with last year and is consistent\nwith the methodology used in the Stock Performance graph incorporated into\nthe Annual Report on Form 10-K for those years. 7.

While the Company utilizes\nseveral performance measures to align executive compensation with Company\nperformance, all of those Company measures are not presented in the Pay\nVersus Performance table. Moreover, the Company generally seeks to\nincentivize long-term performance, and therefore does not specifically align\nthe Company\u2019s performance measures with \u201ccompensation actually paid.\u201d The\nmost important financial performance measures used by the Company to link\nexecutive compensation actually paid to the Company\u2019s NEOs, for the most\nrecently completed fiscal year, to the Company\u2019s performance are: (1) ROTCE;\n(2) Total Revenue; and (3) Efficiency Ratio. Each of these performance\nmeasures is included in the evaluation of Company performance as part of the\nvariable compensation program, and PSAs carry performance requirements tied\nto relative and/or absolute ROTCE.

The dollar value of each equity award was converted to a\nnumber of RSRs using the closing price on the grant date, rounded up to the\nnearest whole share unit. We require deferral of these RSRs until a director\nleaves the Board or later, at the election of the director.\n\nThe Board\u2019s independent Chair also receives a $250,000 annual retainer in\nlieu of any committee chair fee the independent Chair might otherwise\nreceive. This annual retainer is paid entirely in Company common stock and\nmust be deferred until the Chair leaves the Board or later, if elected.\n\nDeferral Program\n\nFor 2023, non-employee directors were able to defer all or part of their cash\ncompensation and equity awards. Cash compensation could be deferred into\neither an interest-bearing account or common stock units with dividends\nreinvested. The interest rate paid in 2023 on interest-bearing accounts was\n2.95%. Equity awards are mandatorily deferred RSRs with dividends reinvested.\nDeferred amounts are paid either in a lump sum or installments, as elected by\nthe director.\n\nDirector Compensation Limit\n\nAs approved by our shareholders at the Company\u2019s 2022 annual meeting of\nshareholders, our equity incentive plan contains an upper limit of the total\ncompensation that a non-employee director may receive annually. Specifically,\nthe total annual compensation paid to any non-employee director, inclusive of\ncash compensation and amounts awarded under the Company\u2019s 2022 Long-Term\nIncentive Plan, shall not exceed $750,000, except that in the case of the\nChair of the Board or any Independent Lead Director, such limit is instead\n$1,500,000.\n                                                                             \n  100Wells Fargo & Co.                                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Director Compensation                                                      \n                                                                             \nDirector Stock Ownership Policy\n\nAfter five years on the Board, each non-management director must own Wells\nFargo common stock having a value equal to five times the annual cash\nretainer, and must maintain at least that ownership level while a member of\nour Board and for one year after service as a director ends. Holding deferred\nshares counts towards a non-employee director\u2019s ownership level, regardless\nof whether the award(s) underlying the deferred shares have vested.\nCompliance with these stock ownership requirements is calculated annually and\nreported to the GNC. Each director who has been on our Board for five years\nor more exceeded this ownership level as of December 31, 2023, and each\ndirector who has served less than five years is on track to meet this\nownership level within five years of becoming a director.\n\nGNC Use of Compensation Consultant\n\nThe GNC annually reviews our director compensation program and periodically\nrecommends changes to the program for our Board to approve. The GNC\u2019s review\nand recommendation, if any, considers our director pay philosophy, relevant\nmarket practices, and consultation with Meridian, the GNC\u2019s independent\ncompensation consultant. The GNC\u2019s review did not result in any new changes\nto our director compensation program for 2024.\n\nDirector Compensation\n\nThe table below provides information on 2023 compensation for our non-\nemployee directors.

The Audit Committee or a designee must pre-approve      \n       changes in the scope of recurring services if they will result in     \n       fee increases in excess of a relatively small amount established by   \n       the Audit Committee prior to such additional services being provided  \n       by KPMG. Changes in the scope of pre-approved services with           \n       estimated costs less than that amount may be approved by the Chief    \n       Accounting O\ufb03cer and Controller.                                      \n       For a particular calendar year, speci\ufb01c types of audit,               \n       audit-related, advisory, consulting, or tax services that could       \n       arise with respect to that calendar year that were not already        \n  2    pre-approved as recurring services, subject to a fee cap for each     \n       category for that year. The Audit Committee also provided the Chief   \n       Accounting O\ufb03cer with 2024 pre-approval authority for audit,          \n       audit-related, tax, and other services subject to annual fee caps     \n       for each category.                                                    \n       From time to time during the year, services that have neither been    \n  3    pre-approved as recurring services nor pre-approved pursuant to the   \n       categorical pre-approval described above.                             \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  106Wells Fargo & Co.                                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Audit Matters                                                              \n                                                                             \nIn determining whether to pre-approve the provision by KPMG of a permissible\nnon-audit service, the Audit Committee considers the facts and circumstances\nof the engagement, including other non-audit services provided by KPMG and\nthe fees for those services, and whether the provision of the non-audit\nservice by KPMG could impair the independence of KPMG with respect to Wells\nFargo. The Audit Committee also considers whether KPMG is best positioned to\nprovide the service because of its familiarity with our business, culture,\naccounting systems, risk pro\ufb01le, and other factors, and whether there are\nalternatives reasonably available to us and the cost of those alternatives.\nThe Audit Committee requires competitive bidding for services that are\neligible for categorical pre-approval and services subject to individual pre-\napproval unless it is not warranted because of the facts and circumstances of\nthe proposed engagement.\n\nDelegation of Pre-Approval Authority\n\nThe Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority to designated Audit\nCommittee members. Pre-approval by a designated Audit Committee member is\nused for time sensitive engagements. Pre-approval decisions by a designated\nAudit Committee member are reported to the full Audit Committee at a future\nmeeting.\n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement107                                                    \n                                                                             \nTable of Contents\n                                                                             \n   Other Management Proposals                                                \n                                                                             \n                                                      \n  Items 4 and 5                                       \n  Amendments to Remove Supermajority Voting           \n  Standards                                           \n  Our Board recommends that you voteFOReach of the    \n  proposed amendments to remove supermajority voting  \n  standards.                                          \n                                                      \nAfter careful consideration, the Board has declared advisable and approved,\nand recommends that shareholders approve:\n\n\u2022 Item 4 : An amendment to the Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of\nIncorporation (the Certificate ) to expressly opt out of Delaware General\nCorporation Law Section 203 ( DGCL Section 203 ), including, without\nlimitation, the default supermajority voting standard required, under certain\ncircumstances, to approve a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested\nstockholder\u201d (as those terms are defined in DGCL Section 203); and\n\n\u2022 Item 5 : An amendment to remove the supermajority vote requirement in the\nlocal director provision in Section 6.7 of the By-Laws.\n\nThese amendments are described in Items 4 and 5 below (together, the Proposed\nAmendments ). The following descriptions are a summary of the Proposed\nAmendments only and are quali\ufb01ed in their entirety by reference to the\nProposed Amendments set forth in Item 4 and Item 5. Approval of either of\nthese proposals is not conditioned upon approval of the other proposal.\n                                                                             \n  108Wells Fargo & Co.                                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Other Management Proposals                                                 \n                                                                             \nWhy the Board Supports the Proposed Amendments\n\nThe Board is committed to reviewing and evolving the Company\u2019s corporate\ngovernance practices in the best interests of its shareholders, in light of\nbest practices, and in response to shareholder feedback. Last year,\nshareholders supported a shareholder proposal requesting that the Company\nreplace voting requirements in the Certi\ufb01cate and By-Laws that call for a\ngreater than simple majority vote with a majority of the votes cast standard.\nCurrently, there are only two provisions that apply to the Company\u2019s common\nstock and require a supermajority voting standard.\n                                                                             \n  DGCL Section 203                                                           \n  As a Delaware company, we are subject by default to DGCL Section 203,      \n  which, under certain circumstances requires supermajority approval of      \n  certain \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d with \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d (as those   \n  terms are de\ufb01ned in DGCL Section 203). DGCL Section 203 is intended to     \n  bene\ufb01t shareholders by limiting hostile takeovers, and to ensure that      \n  there is signi\ufb01cant support before a business combination with an          \n  interested stockholder is approved. The Proposed Amendments would amend    \n  the Certi\ufb01cate so that the Company will expressly elect not to be          \n  governed by DGCL Section 203, in order to eliminate the supermajority      \n  approval of certain business combinations with interested\u00a0stockholders.    \n  Local Director Provision                                                   \n  Section 6.7 of the By-Laws, related to the election of local directors,    \n  currently requires the a\ufb03rmative vote or written consent of eighty         \n  percent (80%) of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock to be amended.     \n  The Proposed Amendment would amend the By-Laws so that future amendments   \n  to Section 6.7 could be approved by either the Board or the shareholders   \n  by the voting standard set forth in the By-Laws.                           \n                                                                             \nThe Board has reviewed these provisions against the results of last year\u2019s\nshareholder proposal and current corporate governance standards. Many\nshareholders and investor associations have begun to view supermajority\nprovisions as limiting the Board\u2019s accountability to shareholders and\ncon\ufb02icting with principles of good corporate governance. For example, the\nCouncil of Institutional Investors has taken the position that\n\u201c[s]upermajority votes should not be required,\u201d and that \u201c[a] majority vote\nof common shares outstanding should be su\ufb03cient to amend company bylaws or\ntake other action that requires or receives a shareowner vote.\u201d 1\n\nBased on this review, the Board believes that approval of the Proposed\nAmendments is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. If\nthe Proposed Amendments are approved and become e\ufb00ective, they will have the\ne\ufb00ect of removing any supermajority voting provisions applicable to votes of\nthe Company\u2019s common stockholders. Speci\ufb01cally, a business combination with\nan interested stockholder subject to a shareholder vote will no longer\nrequire a supermajority vote under DGCL Section 203. Instead, such business\ncombination, if subject to a shareholder vote, will only require the typical\nvote necessary for a business combination under the DGCL (currently a\nmajority of shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the\nmeeting), or the Company\u2019s governing documents. Additionally, future\namendments to the local director provision in Section 6.7 of the By-Laws will\nrequire the approval of either the Board or the shareholders by the a\ufb03rmative\nvote of a majority in voting power of shares issued and outstanding at the\nmeeting. Therefore, the Board has declared advisable and approved, and\nrecommends that shareholders also approve, the Proposed Amendments.\n\n1.

Local Directors . In the event that this Company shall own in excess of\n\ufb01fty percent (50%) of the capital stock of any \ufb01nancial or moneyed\ncorporation or association and if in the acquisition of such stock this\nCompany shall have agreed that as to the voting of such stock for the\nelection of directors this By-Law or an agreement substantially in accord\ntherewith shall be binding on the Company, then and in each such event the\nstock so acquired shall, at all meetings for the election of a board of\ndirectors of any such association or corporation, be voted in favor of the\nelection to such board of a su\ufb03cient number of residents of the city where\nthe principal o\ufb03ce of such corporation or association is located so that, if\nthe candidate so voted for shall be elected, at least seventy-\ufb01ve percent of\nthe members of said board shall be residents of said city.\n\nThis Section 6.7 of this Article VI shall be amended only upon the\naffirmative vote of eighty percent (80%) in amount of the Common Stock of the\nCompany outstanding at the time of such amendment or by the Board after\nreceipt of the written consent of the holders of at least eighty percent\n(80%) of the Common Stock of the Company.\n\nApproval Standard\n\nTo be approved, Item 5 requires the affirmative vote of 80% of the common\nstock outstanding at the time of the amendment. Abstentions and broker non-\nvotes will count as votes \u201cagainst\u201d this proposal.\n\nImplementation\n\nIf Item 5 is approved, such amendment to the By-Laws will be effective\nimmediately. If Item 5 is not approved, it will not be implemented and the\nlocal directors provision in Section 6.7 of the By-Laws will continue to\nrequire the approval or written consent of eighty percent (80%) of the common\nstock outstanding of the Company.\n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement111                                                    \n                                                                             \nTable of Contents\n\nShareholder Proposals\n                                                  \n  Items 6 through 13                              \n  Shareholder Proposals                           \n  Our Board recommends that you voteAGAINSTeach   \n  shareholder proposal for the reasons set forth  \n  below each proposal.                            \n                                                  \nShareholders will vote on the following shareholder proposals (Items 6\nthrough 13), if they are properly presented at our Annual Meeting and not\npreviously withdrawn or otherwise excluded.

In its discretion, the Board may\nwish to consider including disclosures such as:\n\n\u2022 the total number and aggregate dollar amount of disputes settled by the\ncompany related to abuse, harassment or discrimination in the previous three\nyears;\n\n\u2022 the total number of pending harassment or discrimination complaints the\ncompany is seeking to resolve through internal processes, arbitration or\nlitigation;\n\n\u2022 the aggregate dollar amount associated with the enforcement of arbitration\nclauses;\n\n\u2022 the number of enforceable contracts which include concealment clauses that\nrestrict discussions of harassment or discrimination, and\n\n\u2022 the aggregate dollar amount associated with agreements which contain\nconcealment clauses.\n\nConcealment clauses are defined as any employment or post-employment\nagreement, such as arbitration, non-disclosure or non-disparagement\nagreements, that the Company asks employees to sign which would limit their\nability to discuss unlawful acts in the workplace, including harassment and\ndiscrimination.\n\nThis report should not include the names of accusers or details of their\nsettlements without their consent and should be prepared at a reasonable cost\nand omit any information that is proprietary, privileged, or violative of\ncontractual obligations\n                                                                             \n  Supporting Statement                                                       \n                                                                             \nPersistent controversies have surrounded Wells Fargo\u2019s workforce management,\nso it is not a surprise that at last year's shareholder meeting well over\nhalf of the votes cast were FOR this resolution. Wells Fargo's hiring\npractices came under scrutiny when it was reported that the Company conducted\ninterviews of diverse candidates for positions that had already been filled,\nand subsequently retaliated against employees that complained about the sham\ninterviews. It has also been reported that the United States Attorney in the\nSouthern District of New York\u2019s criminal division is investigating possible\nviolations of federal laws based on this reporting.\n\nThe Securities Exchange Commission has shown increased attention to human\ncapital management issues, as demonstrated by its 2020 rulemaking and the\nChairman\u2019s public comments about future, more proscriptive disclosure\nrulemaking. There have been several high-profile derivative suits settled\nrecently, including at Twentieth Century Fox, Wynn Resorts, and Alphabet,\nalleging boards breached their duties by failing to protect employees from\ndiscrimination and harassment, injuring the companies and their shareholders.\n\nA public report such as the one requested would assist shareholders in\nassessing whether the Company is improving its workforce management. Civil\nrights violations within the workplace can result in substantial costs to\ncompanies, including fines and penalties, legal costs, costs related to\nabsenteeism, and reduced productivity. A company\u2019s failure to properly manage\nits workforce can have significant ramifications, making it more difficult to\nretain and recruit employees, and jeopardize relationships with customers and\nother partners.\n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement113                                                    \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Proposals                                                      \n                                                                             \nOur Statement in Opposition:\n\nAnnual Report on Prevention of Workplace Harassment and Discrimination\n\nOur Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal, identified as Item 6 on\nthe proxy card.\n\n\u2022 Since the 2023 annual shareholder meeting, at which the same proposal\nreceived majority support, we have taken the following actions:\n\n\u2013 Engaged with many of our shareholders to understand their views and share\nour perspectives. These engagements helped inform our response to the\nproposal.\n\n\u2013 Published the results of a third-party Racial Equity Assessment, which,\namong other things, assessed our efforts to prevent harassment and\ndiscrimination and disclosed their conclusions and recommendations. In\nresponse, we are making substantive changes to our policies and practices, as\ndescribed below.\n\n\u2013 Included information in the Human Capital Management section of this Proxy\nStatement relating to our policies, procedures, and programs to prevent\nharassment and discrimination, including our Board\u2019s oversight and where\ncertain public information can be found.\n\n\u2022 Our Board and the HRC oversee human capital risk and human capital\nmanagement, in addition to culture and ethics. The HRC regularly engages with\nmanagement regarding our culture, conduct management, and human capital risk,\nand reviews metrics relating to those topics.\n\n\u2022 We have a well-developed framework designed to prevent and address\nharassment and discrimination, including policies and procedures, annual\ntraining, various reporting avenues, and investigation processes for conduct-\nrelated allegations. Our policies include the Code of Conduct, the Anti-\nHarassment and Discrimination Policy, the Affirmative Action, Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Policy, and the Speak Up and Nonretaliation Policy. We\nbelieve these policies and procedures reflect our commitment to prevent and\naddress harassment and discrimination.\n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Engagement                                                     \n                                                                             \nWe first received the proposal for inclusion in our 2023 Proxy Statement (the\n2023 Proposal ), and discussed it with our top shareholders ahead of the 2023\nannual shareholder meeting. After that meeting, at which a majority of our\nshareholders supported the 2023 Proposal, we engaged with shareholders\nrepresenting approximately 51% of our outstanding shares, with select\nparticipation from our Board Chair. During those engagements, we discussed\nthe 2023 Proposal and potential responsive actions under consideration by\nWells Fargo, including our desire to evaluate the REA, given its potential\noverlap or alignment with the topics raised in the 2023 Proposal. Through\nthose engagements, we learned that our shareholders\u2019 overarching focus was on\nour culture, including our Board\u2019s oversight of our culture. We also learned\nthat certain of our shareholders:\n\n\u2022 Agreed with our proposed approach to evaluate the REA after its publication\nas we considered actions in response to the 2023 Proposal, including some\nshareholders who noted that they voted against the 2023 Proposal because the\nREA was underway.\n\n\u2022 Wished to see more disclosure regarding our Board\u2019s role in overseeing\nhuman capital management, including human capital risks.\n\n\u2022 Encouraged us to consider enhancing our disclosures regarding harassment\nand discrimination.\n\nThe proponents submitted the proposal again for inclusion in the 2024 proxy\nseason. We have engaged with the proponents on several occasions with respect\nto both the proposal and the 2023 Proposal.\n\nFollowing our receipt of the proposal in October 2023 and the voluntary\nrelease of the full third-party REA in December 2023, we again engaged with\nthe proponents and conducted outreach to shareholders representing\napproximately 29% of outstanding shares and engaged with shareholders\nrepresenting approximately 17% of outstanding shares. During this round of\nengagement, our shareholders continued to focus on our Board\u2019s oversight of\nhuman capital management.\n\nShareholder feedback received through the engagements described above\ninformed our responsive approach described in this Statement in Opposition,\nwas shared with the HRC and the GNC, and was made available to our Board.\n                                                                             \n  114Wells Fargo & Co.                                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Proposals                                                      \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Board and Committee Oversight                                              \n                                                                             \nOur Board, directly and through the HRC, oversees human capital risk and\nhuman capital management, in addition to our culture and ethics. For certain\nmatters, our Board provides oversight directly, rather than through its\ncommittees. For example:\n\n\u2022 Our Board reviews the results of our annual Global Employee Survey with\nmanagement, has reviewed management reports on Wells Fargo\u2019s culture, and\nreviewed the REA with the third-party law firm that conducted it.\n\n\u2022 Our Board periodically reviews with management special topics relating to\nhuman capital matters, such as labor relations and DE&I.\n\n\u2022 As part of its review and approval of our overall strategic plan, our Board\nannually engages with our Head of Human Resources regarding the strategy for\nthe Human Resources department and reviews our Independent Risk Management\nteam\u2019s assessment of that strategy.\n\nWe believe our Board is adequately equipped to oversee workforce matters,\nwith a substantial majority of our directors having human capital management\nexperience gained through senior management roles in the financial services,\ninsurance, and retail sectors, among others.\n\nFor certain other human capital matters, our Board delegates authority to the\nHRC, which is comprised entirely of members with human capital management\nskills and expertise. The HRC:\n\n\u2022 oversees performance management, talent management, DE&I, and pay equity;\n\n\u2022 periodically reviews the Code of Conduct and management\u2019s efforts to foster\nresponsible conduct and ethical behavior and decision\u2011making throughout Wells\nFargo; and\n\n\u2022 regularly engages with and reviews reports from our Head of Human Resources\nand our senior executive who oversees conduct management, including:\n\n\u2013 culture reports and metrics, including the results of our annual Global\nEmployee Survey;\n\n\u2013 conduct management reports, metrics, and trends, including harassment and\ndiscrimination metrics and whistleblower retaliation matters;\n\n\u2013 human capital risk reports and metrics, emerging trends such as labor\nrelations, and monitoring of human capital risks such as staffing and\nattrition; related risk appetite measures and key risk indicators; and the\nresults of internal audit reviews of Human Resources; and\n\n\u2013 regulatory matters relating to the Human Resources function.\n\nAdditionally, the HRC engages with management regarding shareholder proposals\nrelated to human resources, including vote results and investor feedback\nregarding those proposals, and discusses potential responsive actions with\nmanagement. Specifically, the HRC reviewed the proposal and the 2023\nProposal, vote results, and investor feedback, and discussed potential\nresponsive actions.\n                                                                             \n  Racial Equity Assessment                                                   \n                                                                             \nThe Company commissioned the REA and engaged the third-party law firm in\nSeptember 2022. The REA was underway in April 2023 when the 2023 Proposal\nreceived majority support at our 2023 annual shareholder meeting. As we\ncontinued to evaluate potential responsive actions, we considered it prudent\nto review the results of the REA, which became available in December 2023 and\nincluded an assessment of our framework on harassment and discrimination as\npart of its workforce review (including our policies and procedures), as well\nas conclusions and recommendations.\n\nThe proposal requests a report describing and quantifying the effectiveness\nand outcomes of our efforts to prevent harassment and discrimination against\nour protected classes of employees. While the REA was focused on Wells\nFargo\u2019s efforts in the United States to promote racial equity, serve\ncustomers in historically underserved communities, and promote an inclusive\nworkplace that values diversity, there are some areas of overlap between the\nREA and the proposal. Notably, both the proposal and the REA focus on some of\nthe same protected classes and on Wells Fargo\u2019s employees and workplace\nenvironment.\n\nThe REA, which contains the third party\u2019s conclusions and recommendations,\nincludes an Anti-Discrimination and Harassment Policies and Investigation\nProcedures section, which assesses our policies and procedures. Those\npolicies and procedures assessed in the REA apply to all protected classes.\nWhile we are still evaluating the recommendations in the REA, we have\nprioritized the review of the three recommendations related to the prevention\nof harassment and\n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement115                                                    \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Proposals                                                      \n                                                                             \ndiscrimination, and in response are making consequential changes to our\npolicies and practices, as described below. Accordingly, our 2024 updates to\nour harassment and discrimination policies and procedures will implement a\nmajority of these recommendations.\n\nOur Harassment and Discrimination Framework and Disclosures\n\nThe Human Capital Management section of this Proxy Statement includes\ninformation on, among other things, our policies and practices to prevent and\naddress harassment and discrimination. These policies specifically prohibit\nharassment and discrimination on the basis of race, color, gender, national\norigin, religion, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender\nexpression, genetic information, physical or mental disability, pregnancy,\nmarital status, hairstyle or hair texture, status as a protected veteran, or\nany other status protected by federal, state, or local law. These policies\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 our Code of Conduct, which is publicly available on our website and\nprovides that any such harassment or discrimination will not be tolerated and\nrequires employees to promptly report any such harassment or discrimination;\n                                                                             \n  \u2022                                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  our Anti-Harassment & Discrimination Policy;                               \n                                                                             \n\u2022 our Affirmative Action, Equal Employment Opportunity Policy; and\n                                                                             \n  \u2022                                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  our Speak Up and Nonretaliation Policy.                                    \n                                                                             \nIn an effort to facilitate reporting, we provide multiple avenues for\nemployees to raise concerns (including on an anonymous basis) and our\npolicies prohibit retaliation of any kind against anyone for providing\ninformation in good faith or otherwise in accordance with applicable\ncountry\u2011specific laws.\n\nOur commitments in this area are communicated and reinforced through employee\ntraining programs. U.S. employees are required to complete anti-harassment\nand anti-discrimination training annually. This training covers expectations\nfor workplace conduct, helps employees recognize situations that may involve\nharassment or discrimination, and describes the ways in which employees can\nreport harassment and discrimination matters without fear of retaliation.\n\nWhile our goal is prevention, when an allegation of discrimination or\nharassment is made, our policies require us to thoroughly and objectively\ninvestigate it and take appropriate action, up to and including termination\nof any employee found to have engaged in inappropriate conduct. Our Employee\nInvestigations team typically surveys the parties involved in an\ninvestigation to solicit feedback on the investigation process.\n\nThe proposal also claims that clauses such as arbitration, non-disclosure or\nnon-disparagement, could limit employees\u2019 abilities to discuss unlawful acts\nin the workplace. We believe arbitration is a more efficient, flexible, and\ncost-effective venue for employee claims to be heard. For employees hired on\nor after December 11, 2015, our policies also provide that unresolved\nemployment disputes will be addressed through arbitration. In 2020, however,\nand before the law required it, we eliminated mandatory arbitration for\nemployees in connection with sexual harassment claims. We also do not impose\na non-disclosure or confidentiality requirement on employees who participate\nin arbitration, nor does arbitration restrict an employee from filing a claim\nwith the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or appropriate state agency.\n\nFurthermore, in 2023, we eliminated confidentiality and non-disparagement\nprovisions from severance agreements for non-supervisory employees. In the\nlimited circumstances when we may use confidentiality clauses, such as when\nresolving claims through a settlement agreement, the clauses do not prevent\nan employee from reporting concerns about allegedly inappropriate workplace\nconduct to appropriate law enforcement bodies or regulators.\n\nIn 2024, we will be updating our Harassment and Discrimination policies and\nprocedures to affirm Wells Fargo\u2019s commitment to racial equity. We will also\ntake regular steps to assess employee awareness of and comfort with our anti-\nharassment and EEO policies and reporting channels.\n\nMore specifically we will:\n\n\u2022 update our Anti-Discrimination and Harassment Policy to enhance language\nprohibiting behavior that denigrates persons on the basis of a protected\ncharacteristic;\n\n\u2022 enhance training materials and content to provide more examples and\nscenarios on prohibited behaviors; and\n\n\u2022 continue to assess employee awareness of, and comfort with, our\nanti\u2011harassment and EEO policies and reporting channels through mandatory\nannual training and supplementing that assessment with periodic surveys.\n                                                                             \n  116Wells Fargo & Co.                                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Proposals                                                      \n                                                                             \nWe believe that the proposed metrics for the annual reporting requested by\nthe proposal could subject Wells Fargo to increased litigation and\nreputational risk without providing value to Wells Fargo or our shareholders,\ngiven that comparable metrics are not commonly disclosed by our peers or the\nbroader market.\n\nWe believe the proposal is unnecessary because our actions, which include\ndisclosures in this Proxy Statement of our current framework of comprehensive\npolicies, procedures and programs related to preventing and addressing\nharassment and discrimination and related Board oversight, our voluntary\nrelease of the third-party\u2019s REA, our anticipated actions in 2024 described\nabove, and our Board\u2019s ongoing oversight of human capital risk and human\ncapital management described in this Statement in Opposition and in this\nProxy Statement, are responsive to the requests of the proposal.\n                                                                             \n  Item\u00a06 \u2013 Shareholder Proposal \u2013 Annual Report on Prevention of Workplace   \n  Harassment and Discrimination                                              \n  Our Board recommends that you voteAGAINSTthis proposal.                    \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement117                                                    \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Proposals                                                      \n                                                                             \n                                                     \n  Item 7                                             \n  Shareholder Proposal \u2013 Third-Party Assessment of   \n  Respect for Freedom of Association and Collective  \n  Bargaining                                         \n  Our Board recommends that you voteAGAINSTthis      \n  proposal.                                          \n                                                     \nSegal Marco Advisors on behalf of the AFL-CIO Equity Index Funds, 550 W.\nWashington Blvd, Suite 900, Chicago, IL 60661, the holder of 1,195.506 shares\nof common stock, and two co-filers have advised us that they intend to\nintroduce the following resolution at the 2024 Annual Meeting:\n\nResolution and Supporting Statement\n\nRESOLVED: Shareholders urge the Board of Directors of Wells Fargo & Company\n(\u201cWells Fargo\u201d) to commission and oversee an independent, third-party\nassessment of Wells Fargo\u2019s respect for the internationally recognized human\nrights of freedom of association and collective bargaining. The assessment\nshould evaluate management interference when employees seek to form or join\ntrade unions as well as recommend steps to remedy any practices that are\ninconsistent with Wells Fargo\u2019s international human rights obligations. The\nassessment, prepared at reasonable cost and omitting legally privileged,\nconfidential, or proprietary information, should be publicly disclosed on\nWells Fargo\u2019s website.\n                                                                             \n   SUPPORTING STATEMENT                                                      \n                                                                             \nFreedom of association and collective bargaining are internationally\nrecognized human rights according to the International Labour Organization\u2019s\nDeclaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the United\nNations\u2019 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, Wells Fargo\u2019s Human\nRights Statement, Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, and Supplier Code of\nConduct are silent on Wells Fargo\u2019s obligations to respect these\ninternationally recognized human rights.\n\nIn February 2022, Wells Fargo published \u201cPriority Recommendations of the\nWells Fargo Human Rights Impact Assessment and Actions in Response\u201d that\nsummarized a human rights impact assessment performed by a third party law\nfirm. The recommendations stated \u201cWells Fargo should consider prioritizing\nthe issuance of a comprehensive human rights policy and providing training to\nthe bank\u2019s leadership and senior management regarding the [United Nations\nGuiding Principles on Business and Human Rights].\u201d\n\nIn 2022, Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf told Congress that Wells Fargo would\nnot commit to remain neutral if Wells Fargo\u2019s employees seek to unionize. 1\nIn 2023, various unfair labor practice charges were pending before the\nNational Labor Relations Board alleging that Wells Fargo had violated its\nemployees\u2019 rights. 2 Wells Fargo has agreed to settle one of these unfair\nlabor practice charges. 3 Meanwhile, a Wells Fargo internal presentation\nrevealed that management has been tracking employees\u2019 union organizing\nefforts. 4\n\nThis resolution may help address human rights risks at Wells Fargo\u2019s\noperations in other countries.

While the legislation may spell out certain rights, workers have\neffectively no access to these rights and are therefore exposed to autocratic\nregimes and unfair labour practices.\u201d 5\n\n1. \u201cWells Fargo to Beef Up Labor Relations Staff Amid Union Campaign,\u201d\nBloomberg Law, June 26, 2023, https://news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-\nlaw/wells-fargo-to-beef-up-labor-relations-staff-amid-union-campaign.\n\n2. \u201cWells Fargo Illegally Restricted Union Activism, US Labor Board Officials\nAllege,\u201d Bloomberg, August 10, 2023,\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-10/wells-fargo-bank-\nillegally-restricted-union-activism-nlrb-officials-allege.\n\n3. \u201cWells Fargo Reaches Settlement in Union Retaliation Case,\u201d Bloomberg Law,\nMay 3, 2023, https://news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-law/wells-fargo-reaches-\nsettlement-in-union-retaliation-case.\n\n4. \u201cWells Fargo Privately Worries Union \u201cResurgence\u201d Could Reach Its Workers\nNext,\u201d Bloomberg, April 17, 2023,\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-17/wells-fargo-privately-\nworries-union-resurgence-could-reach-its-workers-next.\n\n5. 2023 ITUC Global Rights Index, International Trade Union Confederation,\n2023, https://www.ituc-csi.org/ituc-global-rights-index-2023.\n                                                                             \n  118Wells Fargo & Co.                                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Proposals                                                      \n                                                                             \nOur Statement in Opposition\n\nThird-Party Assessment of Respect for Freedom of Association and Collective\nBargaining\n\nOur Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal, identified as Item 7 on\nthe proxy card.\n\n\u2022 Following the submission of a similar proposal at the 2023 annual\nshareholder meeting, which did not receive majority support, we engaged with\nmany of our shareholders to understand their views and share our perspective.\n\n\u2022 Our Board and the HRC provide oversight of, and are engaged in, matters\nrelated to human capital risk and human capital management, including\nemployees\u2019 rights relating to freedom of association and collective\nbargaining. In 2023, our Board and the HRC received updates from management\non labor relations. Our Board and the HRC have considered the topic and\nrelated shareholder feedback in connection with its evaluation of the\nproposal and this Statement in Opposition.\n\n\u2022 We respect our employees\u2019 freedom of association and are committed to\nbargaining in good faith with the certified bargaining representative of our\nemployees where one has been designated by election. At the same time, we\ncontinue to believe our employees are best served by working directly with\nWells Fargo and our leadership.\n\n\u2022 We have implemented, and are committed to maintaining, policies and\npractices which are consistent with applicable law regarding employees\u2019\nrights to freedom of association and collective bargaining.\n\n\u2022 As labor relations continue to evolve, we continue to review and evaluate\nour framework and practices, which include the following actions taken since\nthe 2023 annual shareholder meeting: (i) engaging third\u2011party subject matter\nexperts who have advised us on the development and application of policies\nand practices, which are designed to respect employees\u2019 rights to freedom of\nassociation and collective bargaining, as well as the design and\nimplementation of training programs to educate managers on these topics; (ii)\ndeveloping and implementing additional training designed to continue\neducating managers; and (iii) supplementing management\u2019s expertise on this\ntopic.\n\n\u2022 We have included disclosures relating to our policies, practices, and\nstance on freedom of association and the right to collectively bargain in the\nHuman Capital Management section of this Proxy Statement.\n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Engagement                                                     \n                                                                             \nUpon receipt of a proposal requesting the adoption of a policy related to\nfreedom of association and collective bargaining for inclusion at the 2023\nannual shareholder meeting (the 2023 Policy Proposal ), we engaged with the\nproponent and discussed the 2023 Policy Proposal with our top shareholders\nrepresenting approximately 45% of outstanding shares. At the 2023 annual\nshareholder meeting, the 2023 Policy Proposal did not receive majority\nsupport. After the 2023 annual shareholder meeting, we again engaged with our\ntop shareholders, holding discussions with shareholders representing\napproximately 51% of our outstanding shares, with select participation from\nour Board Chair. Shareholder feedback was shared with the HRC and the GNC and\nmade available to the Board. Following receipt of the current proposal, we\nagain engaged with the proponents.\n                                                                             \n  Board and Committee Oversight                                              \n                                                                             \nOur Board, directly and through the HRC, oversees human capital risk and\nhuman capital management, in addition to our culture and ethics. For certain\nmatters, the Board provides oversight directly, rather than through its\ncommittees. For example:\n\n\u2022 The Board reviews the results of our annual Global Employee Survey with\nmanagement, has reviewed management reports on Wells Fargo\u2019s culture, and\nreviewed the results of a third\u2011party REA, which included an assessment of\nour workforce, with the law firm that conducted it. The REA is publicly\navailable on our website.\n\n\u2022 Our Board periodically reviews with management special topics relating to\nhuman capital matters, such as labor relations and DE&I. Given the\ndevelopments in labor relations matters in 2023, our Board and the HRC\nreceived updates from management on that topic.\n\n\u2022 As part of its review and approval of our overall strategic plan, our Board\nannually engages with our Head of Human Resources regarding the strategy for\nthe Human Resources department and reviews our Independent Risk Management\nteam\u2019s assessment of that strategy.\n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement119                                                    \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Proposals                                                      \n                                                                             \nWe believe our Board is adequately equipped to oversee workforce matters,\nwith a substantial majority of our directors having human capital management\nexperience gained through senior management roles in the financial services,\ninsurance, and retail sectors, among others.\n\nFor certain other human capital matters, our Board delegates authority to the\nHRC, which is comprised entirely of members with human capital management\nskills and expertise. The HRC:\n\n\u2022 oversees performance management, talent management, DE&I, and pay equity;\n\n\u2022 periodically reviews the Code of Conduct and management\u2019s efforts to foster\nresponsible conduct and ethical behavior and decision-making throughout Wells\nFargo; and\n\n\u2022 regularly engages with and reviews reports from our Head of Human Resources\nand our senior executive who oversees conduct management, including:\n\n\u2013 culture reports and metrics, including the results of our annual Global\nEmployee Survey;\n\n\u2013 conduct management reports, metrics, and trends, including harassment and\ndiscrimination metrics and whistleblower retaliation matters;\n\n\u2013 human capital risk reports and metrics, emerging trends such as labor\nrelations, and monitoring of human capital risks such as staffing and\nattrition; related risk appetite measures and key risk indicators; and the\nresults of internal audit reviews of Human Resources; and\n\n\u2013 regulatory matters relating to the Human Resources function.\n\nAdditionally, the HRC engages with management regarding shareholder proposals\nrelated to human resources, including vote results and investor feedback\nregarding those proposals, and if relevant, discusses potential responsive\nactions with management. Specifically, the HRC reviewed the proposal and\nconsidered investor feedback, which informed our response in this Statement\nin Opposition.\n\nOur Framework for Respecting Employees\u2019 Rights to Freedom of Association and\nCollective Bargaining\n\nWe respect employees\u2019 rights under applicable laws related to freedom of\nassociation and collective bargaining and we support the legal right of every\nemployee to make a free and informed choice about whether they want union\nrepresentation. Because we feel strongly that employees should have all the\nfacts about unions and union representation before they decide whether to\nform or join a union, we exercise our right, in accordance with applicable\nlaw, to communicate with them about the important topic of unions and union\nrepresentation.\n\nWe are also committed to collective bargaining in good faith with our\nemployees who are represented by a labor union certified as their bargaining\nrepresentative and believe our employees are positioned to make the best\ndecision on whether to be represented by a labor union for themselves when\nthey have full information.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s recent responses to the efforts of employees to seek union\nrepresentation in the U.S. demonstrate our commitment to respecting\nemployees\u2019 rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining. As of\nJanuary 31, 2024, six union representation petitions have been filed with the\nNLRB. Upon the filing of each petition, we engaged directly with the NLRB to\nnegotiate stipulated election agreements. Each stipulated election agreement\nallowed appropriate groups of employees to quickly vote in NLRB\u2011run secret\nballot elections, where employees were able to freely make an informed,\npersonal choice about whether they preferred to be represented by a union.\nMoreover, during these election processes, we followed NLRB rules and\nregulations and encouraged employees to exercise their right to vote.\n\nAs of January 31, 2024, we have 16 unionized employees at two bank branches.\nFollowing employees\u2019 exercise of their freedom of association, Wells Fargo\nrespected this choice and has begun a dialogue with union representatives\nabout represented employees\u2019 terms and conditions of employment, respecting\nthe union representatives\u2019 status as employees\u2019 certified representatives for\npurposes of collective bargaining.\n\nWhile we support and respect our employees\u2019 right to make their own\ndecisions, we prefer to hear employees\u2019 concerns and work with them directly,\nwhich allows us to best determine how we can work together to improve our\nworkplace. Employees are encouraged to raise concerns and feedback. We\nprovide a number of forums for employees to share their voices and insights\nin a public or private manner, including:\n                                                                             \n  120Wells Fargo & Co.                                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Proposals                                                      \n                                                                             \n\u2022 directly to their managers or any manager with whom they feel comfortable;\n\n\u2022 through our confidential EthicsLine, which employees can access by phone or\nonline at any time to anonymously report complaints, violations, and other\nconcerns;\n\n\u2022 through Employee Relations, a team within Human Resources that specializes\nin helping employees and managers resolve workplace conflicts;\n\n\u2022 at town halls conducted by our CEO and other senior leaders, which often\ninclude a question\u2011and\u2011answer period;\n\n\u2022 through an annual global employee survey, which offers employees the\nopportunity to share valuable feedback to help us improve workplace\nengagement, the results of which are shared with the HRC and our Board;\n\n\u2022 through a quarterly survey to a randomized sample of employees; and\n\n\u2022 through Loudspeaker, a company-wide employee feedback platform where\nemployees can provide feedback and ideas on, among other things, improving\nthe customer and employee experience.\n\nOur reporting channels and policies are designed to allow employees to raise\nconcerns without fear of retaliation or reprisal and commit us to managing\nallegations in an objective, thorough, consistent, and timely manner. Our\npolicies do not prohibit employees from forming or joining labor\norganizations or from collective bargaining, nor do they prohibit employees\nfrom discussing wages, benefits, and terms of employment. Our Speak Up and\nNonretaliation Policy also prohibits retaliation against employees who\nexercise their rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining.\n\nOur Continued Efforts to Address the Evolving Labor Market\n\nWe have taken extensive steps to increase awareness and understanding of\nemployees\u2019 freedom of association and collective bargaining rights and how to\ncomply with applicable law. These steps include:\n\n\u2022 Engaging third-party subject matter experts who (i) advised us on labor\nrelations matters, including the development and application of policies and\npractices designed to respect employees\u2019 rights to freedom of association and\ncollective bargaining, as well as the design and implementation of training\nprograms to educate managers on these topics, and (ii) presented to the HRC\non labor relations in 2024.\n\n\u2022 Developing and implementing online engagement and labor training for U.S.\nmanagers. This online training is in addition to the existing in-person\ntraining available to managers and HR business partners. These efforts\nresulted in a completion rate of over 99% of training on freedom of\nassociation and collective bargaining for U.S.-based managers assigned to the\ntraining as of January 31, 2024.\n\n\u2022 In 2024, we will amend our Human Rights Statement to affirm our commitment\nto adhering to applicable local laws regarding the freedom of association and\ncollective employee action. Our Human Rights Statement is publicly available\non our website.\n\n\u2022 Supplementing management\u2019s expertise with additional relevant talent and\nexperience.\n                                                                             \n  Our Disclosures                                                            \n                                                                             \nIn addition to the information in this Statement in Opposition, the Human\nCapital Management section of this Proxy Statement includes information on,\namong other things, our policies and practices, which we believe are\nconsistent with applicable law and provide shareholders adequate information\nregarding our framework on freedom of association and collective bargaining.\n\nWe believe that our Board\u2019s oversight of labor relations matters, our\npolicies and practices described above, and our increased efforts related to\neducation for managers, provide shareholders with appropriately responsive\ninformation about our respect for employees\u2019 rights to freedom of association\nand collective bargaining.

Similarly, the Equator Principles Wells Fargo adheres to have been\ndescribed by Indigenous experts as \u201ccritically weak\u201d and limited in scope. 12\nWells Fargo\u2019s recent Native investment initiative 13 does not shield the\ncompany from material risk connected to insufficient due diligence on\nIndigenous rights. Effective policies that protect Indigenous rights are\ncritical to meeting Wells Fargo\u2019s own commitments and mitigating material\nrisk to shareholders.\n\n1. https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/declaration-on-the-\nrights-of-indigenous-peoples.html\nhttps://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUM\nENT_ID:312314\n\n2. https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/sites/default/files/attached-\nfiles/social_cost_and_material_loss_0.pdf ;\nhttps://amazonwatch.org/news/2022/0622-the-business-case-for-indigenous-\nrights\n\n3. https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/08/514133514/two-cities-\nvote-to-pull-more-than-3-billion-from-wells-fargo-over-dakota-pipelin\n\n4. https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/RAN-Briefing_Line3_KXL.pdf\n\n5. https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/sites/default/files/attached-\nfiles/cerd_request_line_3_pipeline.pdf\n\n6. https://www.stopline3.org/news/women-leaders-line5\n\n7. https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20515906551-1.pdf\n\n8. https://www.michigan.gov/whitmer/news/press-releases/2020/11/13/governor-\nwhitmer-takes-action-to-shut-down-the-line-5-dual-pipelines-through-the-\nstraits-of-mackina\n\n9. https://indiancountrytoday.com/news/enbridge-takes-the-gloves-off-in-\nline-5-battle ; https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/judge-gives-\nenbridge-3-years-to-close-oil-pipeline-on-tribal-land-in-wisconsin-4/\n\n10. https://amazonwatch.org/news/2022/0622-the-business-case-for-indigenous-\nrights\n\n11. https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/publication/blk-\ncommentary-engagement-on-human-rights.pdf\n\n12. https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/2019/11/19/first-peoples-response-\nep4-critically-weak-equator-principles-puts-global-development\n\n13. https://newsroom.wf.com/English/news-releases/news-release-\ndetails/2023/Wells-Fargo-Launches-20-Million-Invest-Native-Initiative-for-\nNative-American-Communities/default.aspx\n                                                                             \n  122Wells Fargo & Co.                                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Proposals                                                      \n                                                                             \nOur Statement in Opposition\n\nReport on Respecting Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights\n\nOur Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal, identified as Item 8 on\nthe proxy card.\n\n\u2022 Our Board and the CRC provide oversight of social and public responsibility\nmatters, including issues impacting Indigenous communities, and have\nconsidered the topic and related shareholder feedback in connection with this\nproposal.\n\n\u2022 We seek to respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples, including their right\nto determine their own way of life on their own lands. We strive to take\nthose rights into account when conducting our business activities.\n\n\u2022 We have existing policies and procedures that underscore the importance of\nrespecting Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights and assessing potential risks to\nIndigenous communities. We periodically review and evaluate those policies\nand procedures consistent with our standard policy management process and our\nenterprise\u2011wide risk and control framework.\n\n\u2022 We have served Indigenous Peoples\u2019 communities in the United States for\nmore than 60 years, and we seek to help these communities achieve financial\nsustainability and prosperity.\n                                                                             \n  Board and Committee Oversight                                              \n                                                                             \nOur Board, through the CRC, oversees our significant strategies, policies,\nand programs on social and public responsibility matters, including human\nrights and Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights. In furtherance of its oversight\nresponsibilities, the CRC reviews our Human Rights Statement and Indigenous\nPeoples Statement. All of the members of the CRC have experience in both\nenvironmental and social matters as well as public policy matters. The Risk\nCommittee oversees our risk management framework, including among other\nthings, our risk management program and governance structures used by\nmanagement to execute our risk management program. We have established risk\nmanagement policies, practices, and procedures, including our Environmental\nand Social Impact Management ( ESIM ) Policy and related ESIM Framework, to\nhelp us identify, evaluate, and manage complex environmental and social\nissues in our financing and investment businesses. All of the members of the\nRisk Committee have risk management experience.\n\nAt our 2022 annual shareholder meeting, shareholders voted on substantially\nthe same proposal (the 2022 Proposal ), which was also submitted by the\nproponent. We engaged with the proponent regarding the 2022 Proposal and\nagain after we received this year\u2019s proposal. While the 2022 Proposal did not\nreceive majority support from our shareholders, we continue to engage with\nour shareholders and are interested in their perspectives on issues impacting\nIndigenous communities.\n\nOur Framework Regarding Respect for Indigenous Peoples\n\nWe believe that the identities and cultures of Indigenous Peoples are\ninextricably linked to the lands on which they live, and we respect their\nrights to determine their own way of life on their own lands, according to\ntheir time-honored cultures, traditions, and beliefs. In acknowledgement of\nthese rights, we adopted and published our Indigenous Peoples Statement (the\nStatement ) in March 2017. The Statement is available on our Corporate\nResponsibility Goals and Reporting webpage.\n\nThe Statement articulates Wells Fargo\u2019s commitment to treating all Indigenous\nPeoples with dignity and respect, as well as our approach to responsible\nfinancing. We encourage our customers to collaborate in a meaningful way to\nmanage the impacts and risks of their activities on Indigenous communities.\nAdditionally, through our Human Rights Statement, which is available on our\nCorporate Responsibility webpage and which was updated in September 2022, we\narticulate our commitment to respecting human rights throughout our\noperations, products, and services, including our expectation for clients to\nrespect the rights of Indigenous Peoples.\n\nWe have existing policies and procedures to evaluate potential risks to\nIndigenous communities and we periodically review and evaluate those policies\nand procedures, consistent with our standard policy management process and\nour enterprise\u2011wide risk and control framework. To help us identify,\nevaluate, and manage complex environmental and social issues in our financing\nand investment businesses, we have established risk management policies,\npractices, and procedures, including our ESIM Policy and related ESIM\nFramework.\n\nUnder our ESIM Policy, when our business groups identify in\u2011scope clients or\ntransactions with actual or potential adverse environmental and social\nimpacts related to Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights, they are required to engage\nthe ESIM team for additional due diligence and assistance in evaluating the\nclients or issues as appropriate. The ESIM team may determine\n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement123                                                    \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Proposals                                                      \n                                                                             \nthat escalated reviews are appropriate. In those cases, the transaction or\nclient would be subject to a review by the applicable business\u2011aligned\ncorporate risk teams, and potentially a management\u2011level governance committee\nthat reviews applicable elevated risk factors of the client or\ntransaction\u2014and, if appropriate, the Risk Committee. The related due\ndiligence is informed by globally recognized standards and best practices,\nsuch as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights\nand the International Finance Corporation Performance Standards on\nEnvironmental and Social Sustainability. As appropriate, Wells Fargo\u2019s\nSustainability team joins relationship managers in client engagements to\nbetter understand clients\u2019 approach to stakeholder engagement with Indigenous\ncommunities throughout the lending life cycle. Through productive engagement\nand diligence with these clients, we have learned about enhancements our\nclients have made over time with respect to their engagement with Indigenous\ncommunities. These practices are designed to encourage clients to continue\nenhancing their practices and help us determine whether our financing\nactivities are adequately reviewed and assessed for, among other things,\nenvironmental and social considerations, including potential impacts to\nIndigenous communities.\n\nFor more than 60 years, Wells Fargo has been a proud supporter of Indigenous\ncommunities, and we continue our commitment to provide capital and financial\nservices to tribes and tribal-owned enterprises. Wells Fargo has banking\nrelationships with 1 out of 3 federally recognized tribes in the United\nStates. We have committed over $3 billion in credit and hold approximately $4\nbillion in deposits for tribal governments and tribally owned enterprises\nnationally, banking more than 300 Native American and Alaska Native tribal\nentities in 25 states. We are dedicated to serving Indigenous communities\nwith products, services, and financial health programs tailored to help\ntribal clients, tribal governments, tribal enterprises, and tribal members\nsucceed financially. We have dedicated employees focused on serving\nIndigenous communities.\n\nAdditionally, Wells Fargo has been a leading philanthropist supporting\ninitiatives focused on Indigenous communities. Between 2017 and 2022, we\ndonated more than $50 million to nonprofit organizations serving American\nIndian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian communities, and in January 2023,\nwe launched Invest Native, committing an additional $20 million in\nphilanthropy to advance economic opportunities in Native American communities\nthrough work with Native\u2011led organizations. For over 10 years, we have\nprovided strategic philanthropic investments to Native Forward, an\norganization serving Native scholars.\n\nWe believe that we are addressing the risks to Indigenous communities\ndescribed in the proposal through our Board oversight, our existing policies\nand procedures to evaluate and mitigate potential risks, and our principled\nand increasing commitment to Indigenous communities.

We also believe that the impact of climate change may\naffect certain communities more than others. To help us identify, evaluate,\nand manage complex environmental and social issues in our financing and\ninvestment businesses, we have established risk management practices and\nprocedures, including our ESIM Framework. Under our ESIM Policy, when our\nbusiness groups identify in\u2011scope clients or transactions with actual or\npotential adverse environmental and social impacts, they are required to\nengage the ESIM team for additional due diligence and assistance in\nevaluating the clients or issues as appropriate.\n\n12. www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/corporate-\nresponsibility/sustainability-and-governance-report.pdf\n\n13. https://sdgs.un.org/goals\n                                                                             \n  126Wells Fargo & Co.                                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Proposals                                                      \n                                                                             \nIn our climate\u2011related philanthropic giving, we maintain a focus on\nvulnerable communities\u2019 access to the opportunities associated with the\ntransition to a low\u2011carbon economy. We have provided grants to promote and\naccelerate efforts to support the flow of capital for mitigation and\nresilience initiatives, with a focus on sustainable affordable housing. We\nbelieve that these efforts can help improve community and individual\nhousehold resilience in the face of volatility brought on by climate change,\nextreme weather events, and increases in utility costs. As part of our\nphilanthropic contributions in support of an equitable implementation of the\nInflation Reduction Act, we have provided over $4 million in grants to\nfinancial intermediaries, including community development financial\ninstitutions and green banks. These grants support community development\nfinancial institutions and green banks in their applications to the\nGreenhouse Gas Reduction Fund designed to strengthen capital availability in\nmarginalized communities that have historically been left behind. Wells Fargo\nhas provided $5 million in grants to support decarbonization and resilience\nin affordable housing, including a collaboration with the National Housing\nTrust to offer training for approximately 30 affordable housing developers\nand state housing finance agencies on advancing decarbonization and\nresilience strategies.\n                                                                             \n   Scope of Business Operations                                              \n                                                                             \nThe proposal requests an audit of the impact of our climate transition\npolicies on \u201cemerging nations.\u201d Our business operations are primarily within\nthe United States, with a relatively limited presence in emerging markets.\nMore than 90% of our revenues come from U.S. clients or activities of\nnon-U.S. clients in the U.S., and our businesses outside the U.S. primarily\nsupport our U.S. customer base.\n\nGiven our current disclosures and limited exposure to emerging markets, we\nbelieve that the audit requested by the proposal would require us to devote\nmeaningful time and resources that could be better utilized to advance key\npriorities.

WFC has committed to\nadvocating for policies that enable client transitions to net zero emissions.\n5 However, WFC\u2019s positions on and details of engagement with policymakers are\nunclear. 6\n\nCorporate lobbying that is inconsistent with the Paris Agreement poses\nescalating material risks to companies and investors. 7 Trade associations\nand other policy organizations that speak for businesses like WFC often\npresent major obstacles to addressing the climate crisis. WFC is a member of\nfinancial industry associations, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business\nRoundtable, American Bankers Association, and the Bank Policy Institute, 8\nwhich are opposing emerging sustainable finance policy, including recently\nobjecting to California\u2019s greenhouse gas disclosure bill, SB 253. 9\n\nWFC\u2019s current disclosures do not adequately inform investors if or how WFC\nensures its direct and indirect lobbying activities align with its net zero\ngoal and the Paris Agreement. WFC states when it disagrees with its trade\nassociations that it is \u201ccommitted to sharing our perspective in a\nconstructive manner 10 ,\u201d but this does not represent a comprehensive, public\nreview of WFC\u2019s memberships and climate policy positions, including how WFC\naddresses any policy misalignment with its net zero ambitions, nor an\nescalation plan for non-alignment.\n\nRESOLVED: WFC Shareholders request that the Board of Directors analyze and\nreport annually (at reasonable cost, omitting confidential and proprietary\ninformation) on whether and how it is aligning its lobbying and policy\ninfluence activities and positions, both direct and indirect (through trade\nassociations, coalitions, alliances, and other organizations), with its\npublic commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050--including the\nactivities and positions analyzed, the criteria used to assess alignment, and\ninvolvement of stakeholders, if any, in the analytical process.\n\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT: In evaluating the degree of alignment between its\nemissions goals and its lobbying, WFC should disclose its direct and indirect\npolicy positions and lobbying actions with regard to climate provisions of\nkey international, federal and state legislation and regulation. WFC should\nconsider investor expectations described in the Global Standard on\nResponsible Climate Lobbying 11 as a useful resource for implementation.\n\n1. https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/chapter/19/#key-message-1\n\n2. https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0426\n\n3. https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/corporate-\nresponsibility/climate-disclosure.pdf\n\n4. https://newsroom.wf.com/English/news-releases/news-release-\ndetails/2021/Wells-Fargo-Joins-Net-Zero-Banking-Alliance/default.aspx\n\n5. https://newsroom.wf.com/English/news-releases/news-release-\ndetails/2021/Wells-Fargo-Sets-Goal-to-Achieve-Net-Zero-Greenhouse-Gas-\nEmissions-by-2050/default.aspx\n\n6. https://www.ceres.org/accelerator/responsible-policy-\nengagement/database/wells-fargo\n\n7. https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/speeches/2021/pub-\nspeech-2021-116.pdf?source=email\n\n8. https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/corporate-responsibility/government-\nrelations/\n\n9. https://www.ceres.org/sites/default/files/reports/2023-\n08/Responsible%20Policy%20Engagement%20Benchmarking%20for%20Banks.pdf\n\n10. https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/corporate-responsibility/government-\nrelations/\n\n11. https://climate-lobbying.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022_global-\nstandard-responsibleclimate-lobbying_APPENDIX.pdf\n                                                                             \n  128Wells Fargo & Co.                                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Proposals                                                      \n                                                                             \nOur Statement in Opposition\n\nAnnual Climate Lobbying Congruency Report\n\nOur Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal, identified as Item 10 on\nthe proxy card.\n\n\u2022 Our Board and the CRC oversee government relations strategies, policies,\nand programs as well as environmental sustainability matters. This oversight\nincludes climate change and climate\u2011related lobbying matters.\n\n\u2022 We disclose detailed information regarding our political and public policy\ncontributions related to climate, and we plan to enhance those disclosures in\n2024.\n\n\u2022 We engage in public policy advocacy on issues that impact our business at\nthe local, state, and federal levels, including through membership in\nfinancial services industry trade associations. Participation in these groups\ncomes with the understanding that we may not always agree with every position\ntaken. When we identify significant misalignment between our positions and\nthose of the organizations we support and sponsor, we aim to share our\nperspective in a constructive manner.\n                                                                             \n  Board and Committee Oversight                                              \n                                                                             \nOur Board provides oversight of sustainability and social responsibility\nmatters directly and through its committees. The CRC oversees our significant\nstrategies, policies, and programs on social and public responsibility\nmatters, including environmental sustainability and climate change. The CRC\nalso oversees our significant government relations strategies, policies, and\nprograms. All of the members of the CRC have experience in environmental and\nsocial matters as well as government and public policy matters. The CRC\nreviewed and discussed a substantially similar proposal submitted by the same\nproponent for a vote at the 2023 annual shareholder meeting (the 2023\nProposal ). The 2023 Proposal did not receive majority support. After the\n2023 annual meeting, the CRC reviewed the vote results, shareholder feedback,\nand this year\u2019s proposal. We engaged with the proponent in connection with\nthe 2023 Proposal as well as this year\u2019s proposal.\n\nThe CRC is engaged in discussing the subject matter of this proposal on a\nregular basis. At least annually, the CRC reviews political transparency\nmatters, including our political activities and contributions, significant\nlobbying priorities, and principal trade association memberships. Our\nGovernment Relations and Public Policy ( GRPP ) team is responsible for\nmanaging the development and execution of strategies that advance our public\npolicy priorities. The CRC also receives reporting on climate-related\ndisclosures and other environmental sustainability and climate change\nmatters.\n                                                                             \n  Enhanced Disclosures                                                       \n                                                                             \nWe already have extensive disclosures related to climate as well as lobbying\nand political engagement. In July 2023, we published our TCFD Report, which\nincludes information on governance for climate\u2011related risks and\nopportunities as well as our engagement with various stakeholders regarding\nclimate\u2011related policy advocacy. Also in July 2023, we published our\nSustainability & Governance Report, which included information on Board and\ncommittee oversight of ESG issues and we disclose our public policy lobbying\nand corporate Political Action Committee ( PAC ) spending for the past three\ncompleted fiscal years.\n\nWe regularly review our public disclosures, taking into account factors such\nas regulatory and legal developments, market practice, other external\ndevelopments, and engagement with our shareholders and other stakeholders. By\nthe end of 2024, we plan to further enhance the disclosures in our regular\nreporting regarding our political and public policy contributions related to\nclimate by:\n\n\u2022 adding information regarding our climate\u2011related advocacy engagement at\nprincipal trade organizations, including our membership in climate\u2011focused\nworking groups;\n\n\u2022 adding information about our business and philanthropic investments and\nactivities that support and utilize our climate policies; and\n\n\u2022 updating information regarding our engagement with climate\u2011related\nnon\u2011governmental organizations and other groups focused on renewable energy.\n\nOur GRPP webpage already includes significant disclosures related to\npolitical and public policy contributions, including:\n\n\u2022 a summary of the most recent campaign contributions of Wells Fargo\u2019s\nemployee\u2011funded PACs;\n\n\u2022 a link to the government website that houses our quarterly lobbying\nfilings, which disclose to Congress our lobbyists\u2019 federal lobbying\nexpenditures and the issues on which they have lobbied;\n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement129                                                    \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Proposals                                                      \n                                                                             \n\u2022 payments made to political organizations organized under section 527 of the\nInternal Revenue Code ( 527 Organizations );\n\n\u2022 ballot initiative contributions in amounts exceeding $25,000; and\n\n\u2022 the principal financial services industry trade associations that receive\nmembership dues from Wells Fargo.\n\nIn 2023, we enhanced our disclosures regarding Board oversight, adding\ninformation about our decision-making approaches for political engagement.\nAnd by the end of 2024, we will further enhance the disclosures on our GRPP\nwebpage, including relating to:\n\n\u2022 the approval process for trade association membership, which includes\ninitial and annual approval by the Head of GRPP and the CRC\u2019s oversight role,\nand for each of our principal trade associations, the percentage of dues paid\nthat is attributable to lobbying;\n\n\u2022 a statement that Wells Fargo does not engage in direct grassroots lobbying;\n\n\u2022 information about Wells Fargo\u2019s established criteria guiding our decision-\nmaking for supporting candidates through the Wells Fargo PACs, which includes\nsupporting candidates who:\n\n\u2013 represent the communities where we have a large presence;\n\n\u2013 understand the important role the financial services industry plays in the\neconomy;\n\n\u2013 are in legislative or political leadership roles; or\n\n\u2013 serve on important committees that have jurisdiction over issues that\nimpact the financial services sector;\n\n\u2022 information about the attestation letters that we obtain from 527\nOrganizations, which affirm that our donations will only be used for\noperational and administrative purposes and not to support or oppose\ncandidates for public office or ballot initiatives, and that donations are\nnot transferred to PACs; and\n\n\u2022 additional disclosures about advocacy and lobbying in the state and local\njurisdictions where we are registered to lobby, by providing hyperlinks to\nthe websites where our state and local lobbying disclosure reports are\nhoused.\n\nLike many companies, Wells Fargo engages in public policy advocacy on issues\nthat impact our business at the local, state, and federal levels, including\nthrough membership in financial services industry trade associations. We\nregularly review our participation model and believe that engagement through\nthese trade organizations, including as a voice of opposition from time to\ntime, is an integral part of our public policy strategy. Participation in\nthese groups comes with the understanding that we may not always agree with\nevery position taken. In instances where we identify significant misalignment\nwith trade associations to which we belong, we aim to share our perspective\nin a constructive manner.\n\nGiven our current Board oversight and disclosures regarding climate and\ngeneral lobbying and our plan to enhance those disclosures in 2024, we\nbelieve that the annual reporting requested by the proposal would require us\nto devote meaningful time and resources that could be better utilized to\nadvance key priorities. Therefore, we believe that this is not in the best\ninterest of Wells Fargo, our shareholders, or other stakeholders.\n                                                                             \n  Item\u00a010 \u2013 Shareholder Proposal \u2013 Annual Climate Lobbying Congruency        \n  Report                                                                     \n  Our Board recommends that you voteAGAINSTthis proposal.                    \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  130Wells Fargo & Co.                                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Proposals                                                      \n                                                                             \n                                                      \n  Item 11                                             \n  Shareholder Proposal \u2013 Annual Report on Congruency  \n  of Political Spending and Corporate Values          \n  Our Board recommends that you voteAGAINSTthis       \n  proposal.                                           \n                                                      \nHarrington Investments, Inc., 1001 2nd Street, Suite 325, Napa, CA 94559, the\nholder of 200 shares of our common stock, has advised us that it intends to\nintroduce the following resolution at the 2024 Annual Meeting:\n\nResolution and Supporting Statement\n\nOur Company published statements proclaiming it monitors and works toward\nprogress on Environmental Social Governance (ESG) challenges, stating it:\n\n\u201cregularly assesses ESG and sustainability themes\u2026monitors ESG trends\u2026which\ninform its strategies, goals, and reporting priorities\u2026.\u201d 1\n\n\u201cbelieves that it has a role to play in addressing social, economic, and\nenvironmental sustainability,\u201d 2\n\n\u201cbelieve[s] that climate change continues to be one of the most urgent\nenvironmental and social issues of our time, and [is] working\u2026to help\naccelerate the transition to a low carbon economy\u2026\u201d 3\n\nHowever, evidence suggests Wells Fargo supports organizations working against\nESG investing, including the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF) and\nthe Republican Attorneys General Association.\n\nSFOF has advanced model legislation in at least five states directing state\nlawmakers and treasurers to cancel state contracts with companies that\naddress climate risk, stating those institutions are \u201cboycotting\u201d fossil fuel\ncompanies. 4\n\nThis evident conflict has not gone unnoticed.

We engaged with the\nproponent in connection with both the 2023 Congruency Proposal and this\nyear\u2019s proposal (the 2024 Congruency Proposal ). The CRC reviewed and\ndiscussed the 2023 Congruency Proposal, the vote results, shareholder\nfeedback, and the 2024 Congruency Proposal.\n                                                                             \n  Enhanced Disclosures                                                       \n                                                                             \nOur GRPP webpage already includes significant disclosures related to\npolitical and public policy contributions, including:\n\n\u2022 a summary of the most recent campaign contributions of Wells Fargo\u2019s PACs;\n\n\u2022 a link to the government website that houses our quarterly lobbying\nfilings, which disclose to Congress our lobbyists\u2019 federal lobbying\nexpenditures and the issues on which they have lobbied;\n                                                                             \n  \u2022                                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  payments made to 527 Organizations;                                        \n                                                                             \n\u2022 ballot initiative contributions in amounts exceeding $25,000; and\n\n\u2022 the principal financial services industry trade associations that receive\nmembership dues from Wells Fargo.\n                                                                             \n  132Wells Fargo & Co.                                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Proposals                                                      \n                                                                             \nIn 2023, we enhanced our disclosures regarding Board oversight, adding\ninformation about our decision-making approaches for political engagement.\nAnd by the end of 2024, we will further enhance the disclosures on our GRPP\nwebpage, including relating to:\n\n\u2022 the approval process for trade association membership, which includes\ninitial and annual approval by the Head of GRPP and the CRC\u2019s oversight role,\nand for each of our principal trade associations, the percentage of dues paid\nthat is attributable to lobbying;\n\n\u2022 a statement that Wells Fargo does not engage in direct grassroots lobbying;\n\n\u2022 information about Wells Fargo\u2019s established criteria guiding our decision-\nmaking for supporting candidates through the Wells Fargo PACs, which includes\nsupporting candidates who:\n\n\u2013 represent the communities where we have a large presence;\n\n\u2013 understand the important role the financial services industry plays in the\neconomy;\n\n\u2013 are in legislative or political leadership roles; or\n\n\u2013 serve on important committees that have jurisdiction over issues that\nimpact the financial services sector;\n\n\u2022 information about the attestation letters that we obtain from 527\nOrganizations, which affirm that our donations will only be used for\noperational and administrative purposes and not to support or oppose\ncandidates for public office or ballot initiatives, and that donations are\nnot transferred to PACs; and\n\n\u2022 additional disclosures about advocacy and lobbying in the state and local\njurisdictions where we are registered to lobby, by providing hyperlinks to\nthe websites where our state and local lobbying disclosure reports are\nhoused.\n                                                                             \n  Our Practices                                                              \n                                                                             \nAs disclosed on our GRPP webpage, we are not members of any tax-exempt\norganization in the United States that is primarily organized to write,\nendorse, and promote model legislation. We do not use any corporate money or\nresources to influence U.S. domestic or foreign candidate elections,\nincluding assisting candidate campaign committees, political parties,\ncaucuses, independent expenditure or other political committees, or any other\ntype of election\u2011related activity. Wells Fargo sponsors PACs that make\ncontributions to candidates and only accept funding through voluntary\ncontributions by eligible employees and directors.\n\nLike many companies, Wells Fargo engages in public policy advocacy on issues\nthat impact our business at the local, state, and federal levels, including\nthrough membership in financial services industry trade associations. We\nregularly review our participation model and believe that engagement through\nthese trade organizations, including as a voice of opposition from time to\ntime, is an integral part of our public policy strategy. Participation in\nthese groups comes with the understanding that we may not always agree with\nevery position taken. In instances where we identify significant misalignment\nwith trade associations to which we belong, we aim to share our perspective\nin a constructive manner.\n\nGiven our current disclosures regarding our political engagement and spending\nand our commitment to enhance those disclosures by the end of 2024, as well\nas our Board\u2019s role in overseeing those matters, we believe that the annual\nreporting requested by the proposal would require us to devote meaningful\ntime and resources that could be better utilized to advance key priorities.\nTherefore, we believe that this is not in the best interest of Wells Fargo or\nour shareholders.\n                                                                             \n  Item\u00a011 \u2013 Shareholder Proposal \u2013 Annual Report on Congruency of Political  \n  Spending and Corporate Values                                              \n  Our Board recommends that you voteAGAINSTthis proposal.                    \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement133                                                    \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Proposals                                                      \n                                                                             \n                                                   \n  Item 12                                          \n  Shareholder Proposal \u2013 Transparency in Lobbying  \n  Annual Report                                    \n  Our Board recommends that you voteAGAINSTthis    \n  proposal.                                        \n                                                   \nJohn Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, CA 90278, the\nholder of no fewer than 100 shares of our common stock, and one co-filer have\nadvised us that they intend to introduce the following resolution at the 2024\nAnnual Meeting:\n\nResolution and Supporting Statement\n                                                                             \n                   Proposal 12 \u2013 Transparency in Lobbying                    \n                                                                             \nResolved, Shareholders request the preparation of a report, updated annually,\npresented to the Corporate Responsibility Committee and posted on WFC's\nwebsite, disclosing:\n\n1. Company policy and procedures governing lobbying, both direct and\nindirect, and grassroots lobbying communications.\n\n2. Payments by WFC used for (a) direct or indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots\nlobbying communications, in each case including the amount of the payment and\nthe recipient.\n\n3. WFC's membership in and payments to any tax-exempt organization that\nwrites and endorses model legislation.\n\n4. Description of management's and the Board's decision-making process and\noversight for making payments described in sections 2 and 3 above.\n\nA \"grassroots lobbying communication\" is a communication directed to the\ngeneral public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation, (b)\nreflects a view on the legislation or regulation and (c) encourages the\nrecipient of the communication to take action with respect to the legislation\nor regulation. \"Indirect lobbying\" is lobbying engaged in by a trade\nassociation or other organization of which WFC is a member.\n\nBoth \"direct and indirect lobbying\" and \"grassroots lobbying communications\"\ninclude efforts at the local, state and federal levels.\n                                                                             \n  Supporting Statement                                                       \n                                                                             \nFull disclosure of WFC's lobbying expenditures is needed to assess whether\nWFC's lobbying is consistent with its expressed goals and shareholders'\ninterests. WFC spent $68 million (2010 \u2013 2022) on federal lobbying. This does\nnot include state lobbying, where WFC lobbied in at least 28 states in 2022\nand spent $3 million on lobbying in California (2010 \u2013 2022).\n\nCompanies can give unlimited amounts to third party groups that spend\nmillions on lobbying and undisclosed grassroots activity. 1 WFC fails to\ndisclose its payments to trade associations and social welfare groups (SWGs),\nor the amounts used for lobbying. WFC belongs to the American Bankers\nAssociation, Business Roundtable, and US Chamber of Commerce, which together\nspent $111 million on federal lobbying for 2022. And while WFC previously\ndropped 2 its membership in the American Legislative Exchange Council, ABA\nsupported its 2022 annual meeting 3 and the Chamber sits on its Private\nEnterprise Advisory Council. 4\n\n1. https://theintercept.com/2019/08/06/business-group-spending-on-lobbying-\nin-washington-is-at-least-double-whats-publicly-reported/\n\n2. https://www.prwatch.org/news/2012/09/11740/merck-and-wells-fargo-dump-\nalec-while-duke-energy-holds-out.\n\n3. https://documented.net/investigations/heres-who-bankrolling-\nalec-2022-annual-meeting.\n\n4. https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/09/06/coming-soon-in-ohio-alec-\nreleases-new-raft-of-model-legislation/.\n                                                                             \n  134Wells Fargo & Co.                                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Proposals                                                      \n                                                                             \nWFC's lack of disclosure presents reputational risks when its lobbying\ncontradicts company public positions. WFC publicly supports addressing\nclimate change, yet the BRT lobbied against the Inflation Reduction Act 5 and\nthe Chamber reportedly has been a \"central actor\" in dissuading climate\nlegislation over a two-decade period. 6 A recent analysis looking at\ninconsistencies between banks' public climate commitments and their direct\nand indirect climate lobbying practices noted WFC failed to publicly support\nthe Inflation Reduction Act. 7 While WFC has opposed voter restrictions, 8\nthe Chamber lobbied against protecting voting rights. 9 And WFC has attracted\nnegative attention 10 for funding controversial nonprofits like the State\nFinancial Officers Foundation, which is attacking woke capitalism. 11\n\nOur Statement in Opposition\n\nTransparency in Lobbying Annual Report\n\nOur Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal, identified as Item 12 on\nthe proxy card.\n\n\u2022 Our Board and the CRC oversee government relations strategies, policies,\nand programs, including political transparency matters.\n\n\u2022 We disclose detailed information regarding our federal, state, and local\nlobbying activities, our memberships in principal trade associations,\ncontributions to 527 Organizations, and contributions made by Wells Fargo\u2019s\nemployee-funded PACs.

We do not use any corporate money or\nresources to influence U.S. domestic or foreign candidate elections,\nincluding assisting candidate campaign committees, political parties,\ncaucuses, or independent expenditure or other political committees, or any\nother type of election\u2011related activity. Wells Fargo sponsors PACs that make\ncontributions to candidates and only accept funding through voluntary\ncontributions by eligible employees and directors.\n\nLike many companies, Wells Fargo engages in public policy advocacy on issues\nthat impact our business at the local, state, and federal levels, including\nthrough membership in financial services industry trade associations. We\nregularly review our participation model and believe that engagement through\nthese trade organizations, including as a voice of opposition from time to\ntime, is an integral part of our public policy strategy. Participation in\nthese groups comes with the understanding that we may not always agree with\nevery position taken. In instances where we identify significant misalignment\nwith trade associations to which we belong, we aim to share our perspective\nin a constructive manner.\n\nGiven our current disclosures regarding our political engagement and spending\nand our commitment to enhance those disclosures by the end of 2024, as well\nas our Board\u2019s role in overseeing those matters, we believe that the annual\nreporting requested by the proposal would require us to devote meaningful\ntime and resources that could be better utilized to advance key priorities.\nTherefore, we believe that this is not in the best interest of Wells Fargo or\nour shareholders.\n                                                                           \n  Item\u00a012 \u2013 Shareholder Proposal \u2013 Transparency in Lobbying Annual Report  \n  Our Board recommends that you voteAGAINSTthis proposal.                  \n                                                                           \n                                                                             \n  136Wells Fargo & Co.                                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Proposals                                                      \n                                                                             \n                                                 \n  Item 13                                        \n  Shareholder Proposal \u2013 Report on Risks of      \n  Politicized De-Banking                         \n  Our Board recommends that you voteAGAINSTthis  \n  proposal.                                      \n                                                 \nAmerican Conservative Values ETF, 9711 Washingtonian Blvd., Suite 550\nGaithersburg, MD 20878, the holder of 8,127 shares of our common stock, has\nadvised us that it intends to introduce the following resolution at our\nannual meeting:\n\nResolution and Supporting Statement\n                                                                             \n                  Report on Risks of Politicized De-banking                  \n                                                                             \nSupporting Statement:\n\nFinancial institutions are essential pillars of the marketplace. On account\nof their unique and pivotal role in America's economy, many federal and state\nlaws already prohibit them from discriminating against customers. And the UN\nDeclaration of Human Rights recognizes that \"everyone has the right to\nfreedom of thought, conscience, and religion.\" 1 These are an important part\nof protecting every American\u2019s right to free speech and free exercise of\nreligion.\n\nAs shareholders of Wells Fargo, we believe it is essential for the company to\nprovide financial services on an equal basis without regard to factors such\nas race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or social, political, or\nreligious views.\n\nWe are concerned with recent evidence of religious and political\ndiscrimination against customers by companies in the financial services\nindustry, as seen in recent examples 2 and the 2022 Statement on Debanking\nand Free Speech. 3\n\nThe 2023 edition of the Viewpoint Diversity Business Index 4 shows that many\nof the largest financial institutions include vague and subjective grounds to\ndeny service like \"reputational risk,\u201d \u201csocial risk,\" \"misinformation,\" \"hate\nspeech\" or \"intolerance.\" These kinds of terms allow financial institutions\nto deny or restrict service for arbitrary or discriminatory reasons. They\nalso give fringe activists and governments a foothold to demand that private\nfinancial institutions deny service under the sweeping, unfettered discretion\nthat such policies provide.\n\nWhen companies engage in this kind of discrimination, they hinder the ability\nof Americans to access the marketplace and instead become de facto regulators\nand censors. This undermines the fundamental freedoms of our country and is\nan affront to the public trust. Politicized de-banking can also damage the\ncompany's reputation and ability to operate in favorable regulatory\nenvironments.\n\nIn early 2023, shareholders called for Chase, Mastercard, PayPal, Capital\nOne, and Charles Schwab to assess whether they have adequate safeguards to\nprevent politicized debanking. 5 Nineteen state attorneys general and\nfourteen state financial officers specifically called out Chase for their de-\nbanking of a non-profit committed to advancing religious freedom and demanded\naction from the company to show good faith in addressing these widespread\nconcerns. 6\n\n1. https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights.\n\n2. https://adflegal.org/press-release/bank-america-boots-charity-serving-\nimpoverished-ugandans-under-vague-risk-tolerance;\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/stop-troubling-trend-politically-motivated-\ndebanking-opinion-1787639;\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12314423/The-Coutts-Farage-dossier-\nbank-admitted-ex-Ukip-leader-DID-meet-commercial-criteria-used-tweet-Ricky-\nGervais-trans-joke-Novak-Djokovic-ties-decide-odds-position-inclusive-\norganisation.html; https://familycouncil.org/?p=25159\n\n3. https://storage.googleapis.com/vds_storage/document/Statement%20on%20Deban\nking%20and%20Free%20Speech.pdf.\n\n4. https://viewpointdiversityscore.org/business-index\n\n5. https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-\nco/investor-relations/documents/proxy-statement2023.pdf pg. 100-101;\nhttps://s201.q4cdn.com/231198771/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/PayPal-\nHoldings-lnc-Combined-2023-Proxy-Statement-and-2022-Annual-Report.pdf pg.\n105-106; https://ir-capitalone.gcs-web.com/static-\nfiles/8de8dcce-b518-491d-bd78-b01a8a66028c page 149-153;\nhttps://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-\nschwab/Charles_Schwab_2023_proxy.pdf pg. 83-85.\n\n6. https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-targeted-by-republican-states-over-\naccusations-of-religious-bias-903c8b26\n                                                                             \n  2024 Proxy Statement137                                                    \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Table of Contents                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Shareholder Proposals                                                      \n                                                                             \nResolved: Shareholders request the Board of Directors of Wells Fargo conduct\nan evaluation and issue a report within the next year, at reasonable cost and\nexcluding proprietary information and disclosure of anything that would\nconstitute an admission of pending litigation, evaluating how it oversees\nrisks related to discrimination against individuals based on their race,\ncolor, religion (including religious views), sex, national origin, or\npolitical views, and whether such discrimination may impact individuals'\nexercise of their constitutionally protected civil rights.\n\nOur Statement in Opposition\n\nReport on Risks of Politicized De-Banking\n\nOur Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal, identified as Item 13 on\nthe proxy card.\n\n\u2022 Our Board, both directly and through the HRC and the CRC, oversees culture\nand ethics matters, social and public responsibility matters, and\nanti\u2011discrimination matters. We believe our Board has the appropriate skills\nand experiences to oversee these matters.\n\n\u2022 We believe that we have a well-developed framework, including our Code of\nConduct, which is designed to prevent discrimination and mitigate related\nrisks. We believe that our policies and procedures are reflective of our\ncommitment to non\u2011discrimination in compliance with applicable laws, rules,\nand regulations.\n\n\u2022 As a global financial institution, we are subject to extensive legal and\nregulatory requirements. Adherence to these obligations may, under certain\ncircumstances, require account closures, though we do not close accounts on\nthe basis of a person\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or\npolitical views.\n                                                                             \n  Board and Committee Oversight                                              \n                                                                             \nOur Board, directly and through its committees, oversees our culture and\nethics, social and public responsibility, and anti\u2011discrimination matters.\nFor certain matters, the Board receives reporting directly, rather than\nthrough its committees. The HRC, which is comprised entirely of members with\nhuman capital management skills and expertise, oversees DE&I matters and\nperiodically reviews our Code of Conduct as well as management\u2019s efforts to\nfoster responsible conduct and ethical behavior and decision\u2011making\nthroughout Wells Fargo. The CRC oversees significant strategies, policies,\nand programs on social and public responsibility matters and monitors the\nstate of Wells Fargo\u2019s relationships and enterprise reputation with external\nstakeholders on such matters. All of the members of the CRC have experience\nin environmental and social matters as well as government and public policy\nmatters. We engaged with the proponent after receipt of this proposal.\n                                                                             \n  Anti\u2011Discrimination Framework                                              \n                                                                             \nWe are committed to maintaining the trust of our customers and following the\nlaws, rules, and regulations that apply to our business, including with\nrespect to the avoidance of discrimination based on protected\ncharacteristics. The Code of Conduct, which is publicly available on our\nwebsite, provides employees with principles designed to help guide their\nconduct with clients, customers, and others who conduct business with Wells\nFargo. The Code of Conduct strictly prohibits discrimination on the basis of\nrace, ethnicity, age, gender, or other protected characteristics. The Code of\nConduct also reinforces our respect for the right to participate in the\npolitical process and to support the candidates, parties, or initiatives of\none\u2019s choice. The Code of Conduct applies to all employees, including\nexecutive officers, and in some cases, our Board.\n\nIn late 2022, we also commissioned a third\u2011party REA of Wells Fargo\u2019s efforts\nto, among other things, better serve and grow diverse customer segments and\navoid discrimination against our customers based on protected\ncharacteristics. In December 2023, we voluntarily published the full results\nof the REA. The REA is publicly available in the Goals and Reporting section\nof our Corporate Responsibility webpage and includes conclusions and\nrecommendations .

Their \u201cimmediate family members\u201d include\nspouses, parents, stepparents, children, stepchildren, siblings, mothers- and\nfathers-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law, brothers- and sisters-in-law, and\nany person (other than a tenant or employee) who shares the home of a\ndirector, director nominee, executive officer, or holder of more than 5% of\nour common stock.\n\nWhich Transactions Are Reviewed\n\nExcept as described below, the Related Person Transaction Policy requires the\nGNC to review and either approve or disapprove transactions, arrangements, or\nrelationships in which:\n\n\u2022 the amount involved will, or may be expected to, exceed $120,000 in any\nfiscal year;\n                                                                             \n  \u2022                                                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  our Company is, or will be, a participant; and                             \n                                                                             \n\u2022 a related person or an entity affiliated with a related person has, or will\nhave, a direct or indirect interest.\n\nWhich Transactions Are Deemed Pre-Approved\n\nWe refer to these transactions, arrangements, or relationships in the Related\nPerson Transaction Policy as \u201cInterested Transactions.\u201d Any potential\nInterested Transactions that are brought to our Company\u2019s attention are\nanalyzed by our Company\u2019s Legal Department, in consultation with management\nand with outside counsel, as appropriate, to determine whether the\ntransaction or relationship does, in fact, constitute an Interested\nTransaction requiring compliance with the Related Person Transaction Policy.\nOur Board has determined that the GNC does not need to review or approve\ncertain Interested Transactions, even if the amount involved will exceed\n$120,000, including the following transactions:\n\n\u2022 lending and other financial services transactions with related persons or\ntheir affiliated entities that comply with applicable banking laws and are in\nthe ordinary course of business, non-preferential, and do not involve any\nunfavorable features;\n\n\u2022 employment of an NEO or of an executive officer if he or she is not an\nimmediate family member of another Company executive officer or director and\nhis or her compensation would be reported in our proxy statement if he or she\nwere an NEO and the HRC approved (or recommended that our Board approve) such\ncompensation;\n\n\u2022 compensation paid to one of our directors if the compensation is reported\npursuant to SEC rules in our proxy statement;\n\n\u2022 transactions with another entity at which a related person\u2019s only\nrelationship with that entity is as a director, limited partner, or\nbeneficial owner of less than 10% of that entity\u2019s ownership interests (other\nthan a general partnership interest);\n\n\u2022 transactions with another entity at which a related person\u2019s only\nrelationship with that entity is as an employee (other than an executive\nofficer), if such transactions are in the ordinary course of business, non-\npreferential, and the amount involved does not exceed the greater of $1\nmillion or 2% of such other entity\u2019s consolidated gross revenues;\n\n\u2022 charitable contributions by our Company or a Company-sponsored charitable\nfoundation to tax-exempt organizations at which a related person\u2019s only\nrelationship is as an employee (other than an executive officer) or a\ndirector or trustee (other than chair of the board or board of trustees), if\nthe amount involved (excluding Company matching funds) does not exceed the\ngreater of $1 million or 2% of such organization\u2019s consolidated gross\nrevenues; and\n\n\u2022 transactions with holders of more than 5% of our common stock and/or such\nholders\u2019 immediate family\n\nmembers or affiliated entities, if such transactions are in the ordinary\ncourse of business of each of the parties, unless such shareholder is one of\nour executive officers, directors or director nominees, or an immediate\nfamily member of one of them.\n                                                                             \n  140Wells Fargo & Co.                                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Information About Related Persons                                          \n                                                                             \nHow Related Person Transactions Are Reviewed\n\nThe GNC is responsible for reviewing and, where appropriate, approving\nInterested Transactions. Under the Related Person Transaction Policy, if\nreasonable prior review of an Interested Transaction is not feasible, then\nthe GNC will consider the Interested Transaction for approval via\nratification at a future committee meeting. When determining whether to\napprove an Interested Transaction, the GNC will consider all relevant\nmaterial facts, such as whether the Interested Transaction is in the best\ninterests of our Company, whether it is on non-preferential terms, and the\nextent of the related person\u2019s interest in the Interested Transaction. No\ndirector is allowed to participate in the review and approval of an\nInterested Transaction if that director, his or her immediate family members,\nor their affiliated entities are involved. The GNC annually reviews all\nongoing Interested Transactions.\n\nRelated Person Transactions\n\nLending and Other Ordinary Course Financial Services Transactions\n\nDuring 2023, some of our executive officers, some of our directors (including\ncertain of our HRC members), each of the persons we know of that beneficially\nowned more than 5% of our common stock on December 31, 2023 (BlackRock, Inc.\n( BlackRock ) and The Vanguard Group, Inc. ( Vanguard )), and some of their\nrespective immediate family members and/or affiliated entities had loans,\nother extensions of credit, and/or other banking or financial services\ntransactions with our banking and other subsidiaries in the ordinary course\nof business, including deposit and treasury management services, brokerage,\ninvestment advisory, capital markets, sales and trading, and investment\nbanking transactions. All of these lending, banking, and financial services\ntransactions were on substantially the same terms, including interest rates,\ncollateral, and repayment (as applicable), as those available at the time for\ncomparable transactions with persons not related to our Company, and did not\ninvolve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other\nunfavorable features. In the ordinary course of business, we also sell or\npurchase other products and services, including the purchase of investment\nmanagement technology products and advisory services from BlackRock and its\naffiliates. We and our customers also may invest in mutual funds, exchange-\ntraded funds, and other products affiliated with BlackRock and Vanguard, and\nwe and such firms may receive fees in connection with those investments, in\nthe ordinary course of business. All of these transactions were entered into\non an arm\u2019s-length basis and under customary terms and conditions.\n\nFamily and Other Relationships\n\nSince 1986, our Company has employed former executive officer Mary T. Mack\u2019s\nsister, Susan T. Hunnicutt, who is currently a Commercial Banking\nrelationship manager. In 2023, Ms. Hunnicutt received compensation of\napproximately $233,000, including a salary of approximately $165,000. We\nestablished the compensation paid to Ms. Hunnicutt in 2023 in accordance with\nour employment and compensation practices applicable to employees with\nequivalent qualifications and responsibilities and holding similar positions.\nIn addition to this compensation, Ms. Hunnicutt also received employee\nbenefits generally available to all of our employees.

SEC\nregulations also require us to identify in this proxy statement any person\nsubject to this requirement who failed to file any such report on a timely\nbasis. To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the filed reports and\nwritten representations by the persons required to file these reports, we\nbelieve that each of our directors and executive officers complied with all\nsuch filing requirements during 2023, except the following: (i) for Felicia\nF. Norwood, three late filings reporting a total of five transactions, all of\nwhich related to transactions through a broker-managed account, that were\nreported on one Form 4, (ii) for Ellen Patterson, three late filings, each\nreporting one transaction, all of which related to transactions through a\nbroker-managed account that were reported on one Form 4, (iii) for Saul Van\nBeurden, one late filing reporting a gift of shares to each of his three\nchildren for which Mr. Van Beurden maintains an indirect ownership interest,\nand (iv) for Charles W. Scharf, an amended Form 3 was filed to report certain\nholdings in a broker-managed account that were inadvertently omitted from his\ninitial, timely filed Form 3. In each such case, the report was promptly\nfiled or amended after the reporting person became aware of the transaction\nor error.\n\nDirectors and Executive Officers\n\nStock Ownership Requirements and Other Policies\n\nStock Ownership Requirements\n\nTo reinforce the long-term perspective of stock-based compensation and\nemphasize the relationship between the interests of our directors and\nexecutive officers with your interests as shareholders, we require our non-\nemployee directors and our executive officers to own shares of our common\nstock. Our Board has adopted robust stock ownership policies that apply to\nour directors, as summarized in Director Stock Ownership Policy , and\nexecutive officers, as summarized in Stock Ownership Policy .\n\nAnti-Hedging Policies\n\nTo further strengthen the alignment between stock ownership and your\ninterests as shareholders, our Code of Conduct requirements prohibit all\nemployees, including our executive officers and directors, from engaging in\nderivative or hedging transactions involving any Company securities,\nincluding Wells Fargo common stock. This hedging prohibition with respect to\nCompany securities applies to any type of transaction in securities that\nlimits investment risk with the use of derivatives, such as options, puts,\ncalls, futures contracts, or other similar instruments.\n\nNo Pledging Policy\n\nOur Board has adopted policies which are reflected in our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines that prohibit our directors and executive officers from\npledging Company equity securities as collateral for margin or other similar\nloan transactions.\n                                                                             \n  144Wells Fargo & Co.                                                       \n                                                                             \nTable of Contents\n\nVoting and Other Meeting Information\n\nAnnual Meeting Logistics\n\nOur 2024 annual shareholder meeting (the Annual Meeting ) will be held\nvirtually via a live webcast so that our shareholders can participate from\nany geographic location with Internet connectivity.

Our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines provide that our Board will nominate for election and\nappoint to fill Board vacancies or newly created directorships only those\ndirectors who have tendered or agreed to tender an irrevocable resignation\nthat would become effective upon their failure to receive the required vote\nfor election and Board acceptance of the tendered resignation. Each director\nnominee named in this Proxy Statement has tendered an irrevocable resignation\nas a director in accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which\nresignation will become effective if he or she fails to receive the required\nvote for election at the Annual Meeting and our Board accepts his or her\nresignation.\n\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines also provide that the GNC will consider\nthe tendered resignation of a director who fails to receive the required\nnumber of votes for election, as well as any other offer to resign that is\nconditioned upon Board acceptance, and will recommend to our Board whether or\nnot to accept such resignation. The director whose resignation is under\nconsideration will abstain from participating in any decision of the GNC or\nour Board regarding such resignation. If our Board does not accept the\nresignation, the director will continue to serve until his or her successor\nis elected and qualified. Our Board will publicly disclose its decision on\ntendered resignations within 90 days after certification of the shareholder\nvoting results.\n\nWhat is the effect of Broker Non-Votes?\n\nUnder NYSE rules, member-brokers are prohibited from voting a customer\u2019s\nshares on non-routine items (referred to as a \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d) if the\ncustomer has not given the broker voting instructions on that matter. A\nbroker may vote customer shares in its discretion on any routine items if the\ncustomer does not instruct the broker how to vote, though the broker may opt\nnot to do so. Whether brokers have discretion to vote the shares on\nuninstructed matters is subject to NYSE rules and a final determination by\nthe NYSE. Therefore, unless you provide specific voting instructions, your\nshares may not be represented or voted at the Annual Meeting. Broker-non\nvotes, if any, will not be counted in determining the outcome of the vote on\nthe election of directors or on any of the other proposals , except for Item\n4 (Approval of an Amendment to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation to\nOpt Out of DGCL Section 203) and Item 5 (Approval of an Amendment to the By-\nLaws to Remove the Supermajority Vote Standard to Amend the Local Directors\nProvision). For Items 4 and 5, broker non-votes will be counted as \u201cagainst\u201d\nvotes.\n\nMay I change my vote?\n\nYes. If you are the record holder of the shares, you may revoke your proxy\nand change your vote by:\n\n\u2022 Submitting timely written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary\nat MAC #J0193-610, 30 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001-2170, prior to the\nvote at the Annual Meeting;\n\n\u2022 If you completed and returned a proxy card, submitting a new proxy card\nwith a later date and returning it prior to the vote at the Annual Meeting;\n\n\u2022 If you submitted your proxy over the internet, by mobile device, or by\ntelephone, submitting another later-dated proxy over the internet, by mobile\ndevice, or by telephone by the applicable deadline shown in the table above;\nor\n\n\u2022 Attending the Annual Meeting as a shareholder and voting your shares online\nduring the Annual Meeting. See Attending the Annual Meeting above for more\ninformation on how to attend, vote, and ask questions during the Annual\nMeeting. Attending the Annual Meeting alone will not revoke your proxy.\n\nIf you are a street name holder, you may revoke your voting instructions and\nchange your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your brokerage\nfirm, bank, or other similar entity before the deadline shown above or you\nmay change your voting instructions by attending the Annual Meeting and\nvoting online during the meeting, provided that you log into the meeting as a\nshareholder using your valid control number included in your proxy materials.\n\nIf you participate in the Company Plans, you may revoke your voting\ninstructions and change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to\nthe trustee or custodian of the applicable plan before the deadline shown\nabove.\n                                                                             \n  150Wells Fargo & Co.                                                       \n                                                                             \nTable of Contents\n                                                                             \n  Voting and Other Meeting Information                                       \n                                                                             \nProposals and Nominations for the 2025 Annual Meeting\n\nWe have summarized below the requirements and timing for shareholders to\nsubmit proposals or director nominations for the 2025 Annual Meeting of\nShareholders.

We have retained D.F. King & Co., Inc.\nto help the Board solicit proxies. We expect to pay approximately $35,000\nplus out-of-pocket expenses for its help. Board members and our employees may\nalso solicit proxies for us by mail, telephone, email, or in person. We will\nnot pay our directors or employees any extra amounts for soliciting proxies.\nWe may, upon request, reimburse brokerage firms, banks, or similar entities\nrepresenting street name holders for their expenses in forwarding the notice\nof internet availability of proxy materials or proxy materials to their\ncustomers who are street name holders and obtaining their voting\ninstructions.\n\nElectronic Delivery of Proxy Materials\n\nWe use the SEC notice and access rule that allows us to furnish our proxy\nmaterials to our shareholders over the internet instead of mailing paper\ncopies of those materials. As a result, beginning on or about March 18, 2024,\nwe sent to our shareholders of record a notice of internet availability of\nproxy materials containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials\nover the internet and vote online. This notice is not a proxy card and cannot\nbe used to vote your shares. If you received a notice only, you will not\nreceive paper copies of the proxy materials unless you request the materials\nby following the instructions on the notice or on the website referred to on\nthe notice.\n\nWe provided some of our shareholders, including shareholders who have\npreviously requested to receive paper copies of the proxy materials and some\nof our shareholders who are participants in our benefit plans, with paper\ncopies of the proxy materials instead of a notice that the materials are\nelectronically available over the internet. If you received paper copies of\nthe proxy materials, we encourage you to help us save money and reduce the\nenvironmental impact of delivering paper proxy materials to shareholders by\nsigning up to receive all of your future proxy materials electronically, as\ndescribed below.\n\nIf you own shares of common stock in more than one account\u2014for example, in a\njoint account with your spouse and in your individual brokerage account\u2014you\nmay have received more than one notice or more than one set of paper proxy\nmaterials. To vote all of your shares by proxy, please follow each of the\nseparate proxy voting instructions that you received for your shares of\ncommon stock held in each of your different accounts.\n\nHow to Receive Future Proxy Materials Electronically\n\nShareholders can sign up to receive proxy materials electronically and\nreceive an email prior to next year\u2019s annual meeting with links to the proxy\nmaterials, which may provide faster delivery of the materials and will help\nus save printing and mailing costs and conserve natural resources. Your\nelection to receive proxy materials by email will remain in effect until you\nterminate your election. To receive proxy materials by email in the future,\nyou may either go to www.proxyvote.com and follow the instructions to enroll\nfor electronic delivery or follow the instructions on the notice, or if a\nstreet name holder, contact your brokerage firm, bank, or other similar\nentity that holds your shares.\n\nIf you have previously agreed to electronic delivery of our proxy materials,\nbut wish to receive paper copies of these materials for the Annual Meeting or\nfor future meetings, please follow the instructions on the website referred\nto on the electronic notice you received.\n                                                                             \n  152Wells Fargo & Co.                                                       \n                                                                             \nTable of Contents\n                                                                             \n  Voting and Other Meeting Information                                       \n                                                                             \nHouseholding\n\nSEC rules allow a single copy of the proxy materials or the notice of\ninternet availability of proxy materials to be delivered to multiple\nshareholders sharing the same address and last name, or who we reasonably\nbelieve are members of the same family and who consent to receiving a single\ncopy of these materials in a manner provided by these rules. This practice\nknown as \u201chouseholding\u201d can result in significant savings of paper and\nmailing costs.\n\nBecause we are using the SEC\u2019s notice and access rule, we will not household\nour proxy materials or notices to shareholders of record sharing an address.\nThis means that shareholders of record who share an address will each be\nmailed a separate notice or paper copy of the proxy materials. However, we\nunderstand that certain brokerage firms, banks, or other similar entities\nholding our common stock for their customers may household proxy materials or\nnotices.\n\nShareholders sharing an address whose shares of our common stock are held by\nsuch an entity should contact such entity if they now receive (1) multiple\ncopies of our proxy materials or notices and wish to receive only one copy of\nthese materials per household in the future, or (2) a single copy of our\nproxy materials or notice and wish to receive separate copies of these\nmaterials in the future.

Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents\ntotal equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill,\ncertain identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights)\nand goodwill and other intangibles on investments in consolidated portfolio\ncompanies, net of applicable deferred taxes. One of these ratios is return on\naverage tangible common equity (ROTCE), which represents our annualized\nearnings as a percentage of tangible common equity. The methodology of\ndetermining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management\nbelieves that ROTCE is a useful financial measure because it enables\nmanagement, investors, and others to assess the Company\u2019s use of equity.\n\nFor purposes of measuring performance, as provided in our Long-Term Incentive\nPlan (LTIP) or the applicable form of award agreement, ROTCE may be further\nadjusted by the HRC, in its discretion, for the effect of (i) losses\nresulting from discontinued operations, (ii) the cumulative effect of\nsignificant changes in generally accepted accounting principles, and (iii)\nany other unusual or infrequently occurring gain or loss which is separately\nidentified and quantified. Under the terms of Mr. Scharf\u2019s offer letter,\nROTCE for purposes of his Performance Shares is adjusted to exclude the\nimpact of any penalties or other charges related to litigation,\ninvestigations or examinations arising out of retail sales practices of the\nCompany or other material regulatory matters related to the conduct of the\nCompany during periods prior to his employment.\n\nIn addition, the HRC believed it was useful to consider certain notable items\nthat occurred during 2023 and 2022 in order to better assess the Company\u2019s\nunderlying financial performance for 2023, including as compared with 2022.\nAdjusted Noninterest Expense, Adjusted Pre-Tax Pre-Provision Profit, Adjusted\nNet Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted ROE, Adjusted ROTCE, and Adjusted\nEfficiency Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures and represent our reported\nfinancial results adjusted for these notable items. We believe that these\nadjusted financial measures are useful because they enabled the HRC as well\nas management, investors, and others to better assess the Company\u2019s\nunderlying financial performance for 2023, particularly for the purposes of\nanalyzing 2023 compensation decisions.\n\n2023 Notable Items\n\n\u2022 FDIC special assessment of $1.9 billion (pre-tax)\n\n2022 Notable

Pre-Tax Pre-Provision Profit (PTPP) is total revenue less noninterest\nexpense. Management believes that PTPP is a useful financial measure because\nit enables investors and others to assess the Company\u2019s ability to generate\ncapital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle.\n\n2. Return on Equity (ROE) represents Wells Fargo net income applicable to\ncommon stock divided by average common stockholders\u2019 equity.\n\n3. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio is calculated under the Standardized\nApproach which is our binding CET1 ratio. CET1 ratio is a regulatory\ncalculation used by management, investors, regulators and others to assess\nthe Company\u2019s capital position.
