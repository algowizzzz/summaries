Management\nbelieves that return on average tangible\ncommon equity and tangible book value per\ncommon share, which utilize tangible common\nequity, are useful financial measures because\nthey enable investors and others to assess the\nCompany\u2019s use of equity. For additional\ninformation, including a corresponding\nreconciliation to generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP) financial\nmeasures, see the \u201cCapital Management \u2013\nTangible Common Equity\u201d section in this\nReport.\n\n(2) The efficiency ratio is noninterest\nexpense divided by total revenue (net interest\nincome and noninterest income).\n\n(3) Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is\ntotal revenue less noninterest expense.\nManagement believes that PTPP is a useful\nfinancial measure because it enables investors\nand others to assess the Company\u2019s ability to\ngenerate capital to cover credit losses\nthrough a credit cycle.\n\n(4) For second quarter 2020 and the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2020, diluted\naverage common shares outstanding equaled\naverage common shares outstanding because our\nsecurities convertible into common shares had\nan anti-dilutive effect.\n\n(5) Consumer and small business banking\ndeposits are total deposits excluding mortgage\nescrow and wholesale deposits.\n\n(6) The risk-based capital ratios were\ncalculated under the lower of the Standardized\nor Advanced Approach determined pursuant to\nBasel III. Beginning January 1, 2018, the\nrequirements for calculating common equity\ntier 1 and tier 1 capital, along with risk-\nweighted assets, became fully phased-in.\nAccordingly, the information presented\nreflects fully phased-in common equity tier 1\ncapital, tier 1 capital and risk-weighted\nassets, but reflects total capital still in\naccordance with Transition Requirements. See\nthe \u201cCapital Management\u201d section and Note 23\n(Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements)\nto Financial Statements in this Report for\nadditional information.\n\n(7) Book value per common share is common\nstockholders\u2019 equity divided by common shares\noutstanding. Tangible book value per common\nshare is tangible common equity divided by\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\n(8) In third quarter 2020, we began reporting\nheadcount rather than active, full-time\nequivalent employees. Prior period balances\nhave been revised to conform with the current\nperiod presentation.\n\n2\n\nThis Quarterly Report, including the Financial\nReview and the Financial Statements and\nrelated Notes, contains forward-looking\nstatements, which may include forecasts of our\nfinancial results and condition, expectations\nfor our operations and business, and our\nassumptions for those forecasts and\nexpectations.

We serve one\nin three households in\nthe United States and\nranked No. 30 on\nFortune\u2019s 2020\nrankings of America\u2019s\nlargest corporations.\nWe ranked fourth in\nassets and third in\nthe market value of\nour common stock among\nall U.S. banks at\nSeptember 30, 2020.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s top\npriority remains\nmeeting its regulatory\nrequirements to build\nthe right foundation\nfor all that lies\nahead. To do that, the\nCompany is committing\nthe resources\nnecessary to ensure\nthat we operate with\nthe strongest business\npractices and\ncontrols, maintain the\nhighest level of\nintegrity, and have an\nappropriate culture in\nplace.\n\nFederal Reserve Board\nConsent Order\nRegarding Governance\nOversight and\nCompliance and\nOperational Risk\nManagement\n\nOn February 2, 2018,\nthe Company entered\ninto a consent order\nwith the Board of\nGovernors of the\nFederal Reserve System\n(FRB). As required by\nthe consent order, the\nCompany\u2019s Board of\nDirectors (Board)\nsubmitted to the FRB a\nplan to further\nenhance the Board\u2019s\ngovernance and\noversight of the\nCompany, and the\nCompany submitted to\nthe FRB a plan to\nfurther improve the\nCompany\u2019s compliance\nand operational risk\nmanagement program.\nThe Company continues\nto engage with the FRB\nas the Company works\nto address the consent\norder provisions. The\nconsent order also\nrequires the Company,\nfollowing the FRB\u2019s\nacceptance and\napproval of the plans\nand the Company\u2019s\nadoption and\nimplementation of the\nplans, to complete an\ninitial third-party\nreview of the\nenhancements and\nimprovements provided\nfor in the plans.\nUntil this third-party\nreview is complete and\nthe plans are approved\nand implemented to the\nsatisfaction of the\nFRB, the Company\u2019s\ntotal consolidated\nassets as defined\nunder the consent\norder will be limited\nto the level as of\nDecember 31, 2017.\nCompliance with this\nasset cap is measured\non a two-quarter daily\naverage basis to allow\nfor management of\ntemporary\nfluctuations. Due to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic,\non April 8, 2020, the\nFRB amended the\nconsent order to allow\nthe Company to exclude\nfrom the asset cap any\non-balance sheet\nexposure resulting\nfrom loans made by the\nCompany in connection\nwith the Small\nBusiness\nAdministration\u2019s\nPaycheck Protection\nProgram and the FRB\u2019s\nMain Street Lending\nProgram.\n\nAs required under the\namendment to the\nconsent order, certain\nfees and other\neconomic benefits\nreceived by the\nCompany from loans\nmade in connection\nwith these programs\nshall be transferred\nto the U.S. Treasury\nor to non-profit\norganizations approved\nby the FRB that\nsupport small\nbusinesses. After\nremoval of the asset\ncap, a second third-\nparty review must also\nbe conducted to assess\nthe efficacy and\nsustainability of the\nenhancements and\nimprovements.\n\nConsent Orders with\nthe Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau and\nOffice of the\nComptroller of the\nCurrency Regarding\nCompliance Risk\nManagement Program,\nAutomobile Collateral\nProtection Insurance\nPolicies, and Mortgage\nInterest Rate Lock\nExtensions\n\nOn April 20, 2018, the\nCompany entered into\nconsent orders with\nthe Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau\n(CFPB) and the Office\nof the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (OCC) to\npay an aggregate of $1\nbillion in civil money\npenalties to resolve\nmatters regarding the\nCompany\u2019s compliance\nrisk management\nprogram and past\npractices involving\ncertain automobile\ncollateral protection\ninsurance (CPI)\npolicies and certain\nmortgage interest rate\nlock extensions. As\nrequired by the\nconsent orders, the\nCompany submitted to\nthe CFPB and OCC an\nenterprise-wide\ncompliance risk\nmanagement plan and a\nplan to enhance the\nCompany\u2019s internal\naudit program with\nrespect to federal\nconsumer financial law\nand the terms of the\nconsent orders. In\naddition, as required\nby the consent orders,\nthe Company submitted\nfor non-objection\nplans to remediate\ncustomers affected by\nthe automobile\ncollateral protection\ninsurance and mortgage\ninterest rate lock\nmatters, as well as a\nplan for the\nmanagement of\nremediation activities\nconducted by the\nCompany.\n                                              \n  Retail Sales Practices Matters              \n                                              \nIn September 2016, we\nannounced settlements\nwith the CFPB, the\nOCC, and the Office of\nthe Los Angeles City\nAttorney, and entered\ninto related consent\norders with the CFPB\nand the OCC, in\nconnection with\nallegations that some\nof our retail\ncustomers received\nproducts and services\nthey did not request.\nAs a result, it\nremains a top priority\nto rebuild trust\nthrough a\ncomprehensive action\nplan that includes\nmaking things right\nfor our customers,\nemployees, and other\nstakeholders, and\nbuilding a better\nCompany for the\nfuture. Our priority\nof rebuilding trust\nhas included numerous\nactions focused on\nidentifying potential\nfinancial harm to\ncustomers resulting\nfrom these matters and\nproviding remediation.\n\nFor additional\ninformation regarding\nretail sales practices\nmatters, including\nrelated legal matters,\nsee the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\n                                             3\n                                              \n  Overview(continued)                         \n                                              \nsection in our 2019\nForm 10-K and Note 14\n(Legal Actions) to\nFinancial Statements\nin this Report.\n                                              \n  Other Customer Remediation Activities       \n                                              \nOur priority of\nrebuilding trust has\nalso included an\neffort to identify\nother areas or\ninstances where\ncustomers may have\nexperienced financial\nharm, provide\nremediation as\nappropriate, and\nimplement additional\noperational and\ncontrol procedures. We\nare working with our\nregulatory agencies in\nthis effort.

We have taken\ncomprehensive steps to\nhelp customers,\nemployees and\ncommunities.\n\nWe have strong levels\nof capital and\nliquidity, and we\nremain focused on\ndelivering for our\ncustomers and\ncommunities to get\nthrough these\nunprecedented times.\n\nPAYCHECK PROTECTION\nPROGRAM The\nCoronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic\nSecurity Act (CARES\nAct) created funding\nfor the Small Business\nAdministration\u2019s (SBA)\nloan program providing\nforgiveness of up to\nthe full principal\namount of qualifying\nloans guaranteed under\na new program called\nthe Paycheck\nProtection Program\n(PPP). The intent of\nthe PPP is to provide\nloans to small\nbusinesses in order to\nkeep their employees\non the payroll and\nmake certain other\neligible payments.\nLoans granted under\nthe PPP are guaranteed\nby the SBA and are\nfully forgivable if\nused for qualifying\nexpenses such as\npayroll, mortgage\ninterest, rent and\nutilities. If the\nloans are not\nforgiven, they must be\nrepaid over a\n\nterm not to exceed\nfive years. Under the\nPPP, through September\n30, 2020, we funded\n$10.5 billion in loans\nto more than 190,000\nborrowers and deferred\n$417 million of SBA\nprocessing fees that\nwill be recognized as\ninterest income over\nthe term of the loans.\nAs of September 30,\n2020, $10.2 billion of\nprincipal remained\noutstanding on these\nPPP loans. We have\ncommitted to donating\nthe gross processing\nfees received from\nfunding PPP loans to\nnon-profit\norganizations that\nsupport small\nbusinesses as the fees\nare recognized in\nearnings. Through\nSeptember 30, 2020, we\ndonated $51 million of\nprocessing fees.\n\nSBA SIX-MONTH PAYMENT\nASSISTANCE Under the\nCARES Act, the SBA\nwill make principal\nand interest payments\non behalf of certain\nborrowers for six\nmonths. During the\nfirst nine months of\n2020, over 20,000 of\nour lending customers\nwere eligible for SBA\npayment assistance,\nand we received $393\nmillion in payments\nfrom the SBA.\n                                              \n  LIBOR Transition                            \n                                              \nDue to uncertainty\nsurrounding the\nsuitability and\nsustainability of the\nLondon Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR),\ncentral banks and\nglobal regulators have\ncalled for financial\nmarket participants to\nprepare for the\ndiscontinuation of\nLIBOR by the end of\n2021. LIBOR is a\nwidely-referenced\nbenchmark rate, which\nis published in five\ncurrencies and a range\nof tenors, and seeks\nto estimate the cost\nat which banks can\nborrow on an unsecured\nbasis from other\nbanks. We have a\nsignificant number of\nassets and liabilities\nreferenced to LIBOR\nand other interbank\noffered rates (IBORs),\nsuch as commercial\nloans, adjustable-rate\nmortgage loans,\nderivatives, debt\nsecurities, and long-\nterm debt.\n\nAccordingly, we\nestablished a LIBOR\nTransition Office\n(LTO) in February\n2018, with senior\nmanagement and Board\noversight. The LTO is\nresponsible for\ndeveloping a\ncoordinated strategy\nto transition the\nIBOR-linked contracts\nand processes across\nWells Fargo to\nalternative reference\nrates and serves as\nthe primary conduit\nbetween Wells Fargo\nand relevant industry\ngroups, such as the\nAlternative Reference\nRates Committee\n(ARRC).\n\nIn addition, the\nCompany is actively\nworking with\nregulators, industry\nworking groups (such\nas the ARRC) and trade\nassociations that are\ndeveloping guidance to\nfacilitate an orderly\ntransition away from\nthe use of LIBOR. We\nare closely monitoring\nand seeking to follow\nthe recommendations\nand guidance announced\nby such organizations,\nincluding those\nannounced by the ARRC\nand the Bank of\nEngland\u2019s Working\nGroup on Sterling\nRisk-Free Reference\nRates. We continue to\nassess the risks and\nrelated impacts\nassociated with a\ntransition away from\nIBORs.

Asset-based fees include fees from\nadvisory accounts that are based on a\npercentage of the market value of the assets\nas of the beginning of the quarter.

Servicing income, net\ndecreased reflecting: \u2022 higher MSR valuation\nlosses, net of hedge results, as gains from\nfavorable hedge results were more than offset\nby valuation adjustments for higher expected\nservicing costs and prepayment estimates due\nto changes in economic conditions; and \u2022 lower\nservicing fees due to a lower balance of loans\nserviced for others and the impacts of\ncustomer accommodations instituted in response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic . For additional\ninformation on servicing income, s ee Note 11\n(Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial\nStatements in this Report. Net gains on\nmortgage loan origination/sales activities\nincreased driven by: \u2022 higher residential real\nestate HFS origination volumes; and \u2022 an\nincrease in production margin due to higher\nmargins in both our retail and correspondent\nproduction channels, as well as a shift to\nmore retail origination volume, which has a\nhigher margin.

Since our\nlast annual\nassessment, we have\nobserved a significant\ndecline in market\ncapitalization given\ndeteriorated\nmacroeconomic\nconditions from the\nimpact of the COVID-19\npandemic. In first and\nsecond quarter 2020,\nwe performed interim,\nquantitative\nimpairment assessments\nof our goodwill with\nno evidence of\ngoodwill impairment.\nGiven the uncertainty\nof the severity or\nlength of the current\neconomic downturn, we\ncontinue to monitor\nour performance\nagainst our internal\nforecasts as well as\nmarket conditions for\ncircumstances that\ncould have a further\nnegative effect on the\nestimated fair\n\nvalues of our\nreporting units. In\nthird quarter 2020, we\nperformed a\nqualitative assessment\nof goodwill impairment\nand concluded that it\nwas more likely than\nnot that the fair\nvalue of our reporting\nunits were greater\nthan their carrying\namounts as of\nSeptember 30, 2020.\n\nThe aggregate fair\nvalue of our reporting\nunits calculated\nduring our latest\ninterim quantitative\nassessment exceeded\nour market\ncapitalization as of\nSeptember 30, 2020.\nIndividual reporting\nunit fair values\ncannot be directly\ncorrelated to the\nCompany\u2019s market\ncapitalization.\nHowever, we consider\nseveral factors in the\ncomparison of\naggregate fair value\nto market\ncapitalization,\nincluding (i) control\npremiums adjusted for\nthe current market\nenvironment, which\ninclude synergies that\nmay not be reflected\nin current market\npricing, (ii) degree\nof complexity and\nexecution risk at the\nreporting unit level\ncompared with the\nenterprise level, and\n(iii) issues or risks\nrelated to the Company\nlevel that may not be\nincluded in the fair\nvalue of the\nindividual reporting\nunits.\n\nIn connection with the\nplanned change to our\noperating segment\ndisclosures, we will\nrealign our goodwill\nto the reporting units\nthat underlie our\noperating segments,\nwhich could impact the\nresults of our\ngoodwill impairment\nassessment. We will\nreassess goodwill for\nimpairment at the time\nof the realignment.

Credit Risk\nManagement We define\ncredit risk as the\nrisk of loss\nassociated with a\nborrower or\ncounterparty default\n(failure to meet\nobligations in\naccordance with agreed\nupon terms). Credit\nrisk exists with many\nof our assets and\nexposures such as debt\nsecurity holdings,\ncertain derivatives,\nand loans. The Board\u2019s\nCredit Committee has\nprimary oversight\nresponsibility for\ncredit risk. At the\nmanagement level,\nCredit Risk, which is\npart of the Company\u2019s\nIndependent Risk\nManagement (IRM)\norganization, has\nprimary oversight\nresponsibility for\ncredit risk. Credit\nRisk reports to the\nChief Risk Officer\n(CRO) and also\nprovides periodic\nreports related to\ncredit risk to the\nBoard\u2019s Credit\nCommittee.

We employ various credit risk\nmanagement and monitoring activities to\nmitigate risks associated with multiple risk\nfactors affecting loans we hold, could acquire\nor originate including: \u2022 Loan concentrations\nand related credit quality; \u2022 Counterparty\ncredit risk; \u2022 Economic and market conditions;\n\u2022 Legislative or regulatory mandates;\n\n\u2022 Changes in interest rates; \u2022 Merger and\nacquisition activities; and \u2022 Reputation risk.\nOur credit risk management oversight process\nis governed centrally, but provides for direct\nmanagement and accountability by our lines of\nbusiness. Our overall credit process includes\ncomprehensive credit policies, disciplined\ncredit underwriting, frequent and detailed\nrisk measurement and modeling, extensive\ncredit training programs, and a continual loan\nreview and audit process. A key to our credit\nrisk management is adherence to a well-\ncontrolled underwriting process, which we\nbelieve is appropriate for the needs of our\ncustomers as well as investors who purchase\nthe loans or securities collateralized by the\nloans. Credit Quality Overview Credit quality\nin third quarter 2020 continued to be affected\nby the economic impact that the COVID-19\npandemic had on our customer base. Third\nquarter 2020 results reflected: \u2022 Nonaccrual\nloans were $8.0 billion at September 30, 2020,\nup from $5.3 billion at December 31, 2019.\nCommercial nonaccrual loans increased to $4.4\nbillion at September 30, 2020, compared with\n$2.3 billion at December 31, 2019, and\nconsumer nonaccrual loans increased to $3.6\nbillion at September 30, 2020, compared with\n$3.1 billion at December 31, 2019. Nonaccrual\nloans represented 0.87% of total loans at\nSeptember 30, 2020, compared with 0.56% at\nDecember 31, 2019. \u2022 Net loan charge-offs\n(annualized) as a percentage of our average\ncommercial and consumer loan portfolios were\n0.29% and 0.30% in the third quarter and 0.33%\nand 0.44% in the first nine months of 2020,\nrespectively, compared with 0.11% and 0.46% in\nthe third quarter and 0.12% and 0.47% in the\nfirst nine months of 2019. \u2022 Loans that are\nnot government insured/guaranteed and 90 days\nor more past due and still accruing were $108\nmillion and $549 million in our commercial and\nconsumer portfolios, respectively, at\nSeptember 30, 2020, compared with $78 million\nand $855 million at December 31, 2019. \u2022\nProvision for credit losses for loans was $751\nmillion and $14.1 billion in the third quarter\nand first nine months of 2020, respectively,\ncompared with $695 million and $2.0 billion\nfor the same periods a year ago. \u2022 The ACL for\nloans totaled $20.5 billion, or 2.22% of total\nloans, at September 30, 2020, up from $10.5\nbillion, or 1.09%, at December 31, 2019.\nAdditional information on our loan portfolios\nand our credit quality trends follows.\nTROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING RELIEF The CARES\nAct provides banks optional, temporary relief\nfrom accounting for certain loan modifications\nas troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). The\nmodifications must be related to the adverse\neffects of COVID-19, and certain other\ncriteria are required to be met in order to\napply the relief. In first quarter 2020, we\nelected to apply the TDR relief provided by\nthe CARES Act, which expires no later than\nDecember 31, 2020. On April 7, 2020, federal\nbanking regulators issued the Interagency\nStatement on Loan Modifications and Reporting\nfor Financial Institutions Working with\nCustomers Affected by the\n                                            25\nRisk Management \u2013\nCredit Risk Management\n(continued)\n\nCoronavirus (Revised)\n(the Interagency\nStatement). The\nInteragency Statement\nprovides additional\nTDR relief as it\nclarifies that it is\nnot necessary to\nconsider the impact of\nCOVID-19 on the\nfinancial condition of\na borrower in\nconnection with short-\nterm (e.g., six months\nor less) loan\nmodifications related\nto COVID-19 provided\nthe borrower is\ncurrent at the date\nthe modification\nprogram is\nimplemented. For\nadditional information\nregarding the TDR\nrelief provided by the\nCARES Act and the\nclarifying TDR\naccounting guidance\nfrom the Interagency\nStatement, see Note 1\n(Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial\nStatements in this\nReport.\n\nThe TDR relief\nprovided under the\nCARES Act, as well as\nfrom the Interagency\nStatement, does not\nchange our processes\nfor monitoring the\ncredit quality of our\nloan portfolios or for\nupdating our\nmeasurement of the\nallowance for credit\nlosses for loans based\non expected losses.\n\nAdditionally, our\nelection to apply the\nTDR relief provided by\nthe CARES Act and the\nInteragency Statement\nimpacts our regulatory\ncapital ratios as\nthese loan\nmodifications related\nto COVID-19 are not\nadjusted to a higher\nrisk-weighting\nnormally required with\nTDR classification.\n                                              \n  COVID-Related Lending Accommodations        \n                                              \nDuring the first nine\nmonths of 2020, we\nprovided\naccommodations to\ncustomers in response\nto the COVID-19\npandemic, including\nfee reversals for\nconsumer and small\nbusiness banking\ncustomers, and payment\ndeferrals, fee\nwaivers, covenant\nwaivers, and other\nexpanded assistance\nfor mortgage, credit\ncard, automobile,\nsmall business,\npersonal and\ncommercial lending\ncustomers. Certain\nforeclosure,\ncollection and credit\nbureau reporting\nactivities were also\nsuspended.\nAdditionally, we\ndeferred rental\npayments on certain\nleased assets for\nwhich we are the\nlessor.\n\nTable 9 and Table 9a\nsummarize the unpaid\nprincipal balance\n(UPB) of commercial\nand consumer loans\nthat received\naccommodations under\nloan modification\nprograms established\nto assist customers\nwith the economic\nimpact of the COVID-19\npandemic (COVID-\nrelated modifications)\nand that remained in a\ndeferral period as of\nSeptember 30, 2020.\nThese amounts included\naccommodations made\nfor customers with\nloans reported on our\nconsolidated balance\nsheet and excluded\naccommodations made\nfor customers with\nloans that we service\nfor others. COVID-\nrelated modifications\nprimarily included\npayment deferrals of\nprincipal, interest or\nboth as well as\ninterest and fee\nwaivers.\n\nCustomer payment\ndeferral activities\ninstituted in response\nto the COVID-19\npandemic could delay\nthe recognition of net\ncharge-offs,\ndelinquencies, and\nnonaccrual status for\nthose customers who\nwould have otherwise\nmoved into past due or\nnonaccrual status.\nCustomers requiring\nassistance after\nreceiving payment\ndeferrals under the\nprograms described in\nTables 9 and 9a may be\neligible to receive\nmodifications\nconsistent with those\noffered prior to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic,\nsuch as interest rate\nreductions, term\nextensions, or\nprincipal forgiveness.\n\nOf the total\nmodifications granted\nduring the first nine\nmonths of 2020, $222\nmillion and $6.1\nbillion of unpaid\nprincipal balance of\ncommercial and\nconsumer loans,\nrespectively, were\nclassified as TDRs as\nof September 30, 2020,\nincluding $201 million\nand $4.0 billion,\nrespectively, that\nwere already\nclassified as a TDR\nwhen the COVID-related\nmodification was\ngranted.\n\nFor information\nrelated to loans that\nare classified as\nTDRs, see Note 6\n(Loans and Allowance\nfor Credit Losses) to\nFinancial Statements\nin this Report.\n\nTable 9: Commercial\nLoan Modifications\nRelated to COVID-19\n

It is not\nunusual for these\nlines and loans to\nhave draw periods,\ninterest-only\npayments, balloon\npayments, adjustable\nrates, and similar\nfeatures. Junior lien\nloan products are\nmostly amortizing\npayment loans with\nfixed interest rates\nand repayment periods\nbetween five to 30\nyears.\n\nWe continuously\nmonitor the credit\nperformance of our\njunior lien mortgage\nportfolio for trends\nand factors that\ninfluence the\nfrequency and severity\nof losses, such as\njunior lien mortgage\nperformance when the\nfirst mortgage loan is\ndelinquent. Table 16\nshows certain\ndelinquency and loss\ninformation for the\njunior lien mortgage\nportfolio and lists\nthe top five states by\noutstanding balance.\nThe decrease in\noutstanding balances\nsince December 31,\n2019, predominantly\n\nreflected loan\npaydowns. Beginning in\nsecond quarter 2020,\nwe suspended the\norigination of junior\nlien mortgages. As of\nSeptember 30, 2020, 4%\nof the outstanding\nbalance of the junior\nlien mortgage\nportfolio was\nassociated with loans\nthat had a combined\nloan to value (CLTV)\nratio in excess of\n100%. Of those junior\nlien mortgages with a\nCLTV ratio in excess\nof 100%, 3% were 30\ndays or more past due.\nCLTV means the ratio\nof the total loan\nbalance of first\nmortgages and junior\nlien mortgages\n(including unused line\namounts for credit\nline products) to\nproperty collateral\nvalue. The unsecured\nportion (the\noutstanding amount\nthat was in excess of\nthe most recent\nproperty collateral\nvalue) of the\noutstanding balances\nof these loans totaled\n1% of the junior lien\nmortgage portfolio at\nSeptember 30, 2020.\nFor additional\ninformation on\nconsumer loans by\nLTV/CLTV, see Table\n6.12 in Note 6 (Loans\nand Related Allowance\nfor Credit Losses) to\nFinancial Statements\nin this Report.\n\nTable 16: Junior Lien\nMortgage Portfolio\nPerformance\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) In connection with\nour adoption of CECL\non January 1, 2020,\nPCI loans were\nreclassified as PCD\nloans and are\ntherefore included\nwith other non-PCD\nloans in this table.\nFor additional\ninformation, see Note\n1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial\nStatements in this\nReport.\n\nOur junior lien, as\nwell as first lien,\nlines of credit\nportfolios generally\nhave draw periods of\n10, 15 or 20 years\nwith variable interest\nrate and payment\noptions available\nduring the draw period\nof (1) interest only\nor (2) 1.5% of\noutstanding principal\nbalance plus accrued\ninterest. As of\nSeptember 30, 2020,\nlines of credit in a\ndraw period primarily\nused the interest-only\noption. During the\ndraw period, the\nborrower has the\noption of converting\nall or a portion of\nthe line from a\nvariable interest rate\nto a fixed rate with\nterms including\ninterest-only payments\nfor a fixed period\nbetween three to seven\nyears or a fully\namortizing payment\nwith a fixed period\nbetween five to 30\nyears. At the end of\nthe draw period, a\nline of credit\ngenerally converts to\nan amortizing payment\nschedule with\nrepayment terms of up\nto 30 years based on\nthe balance at time of\nconversion. Certain\nlines and loans have\nbeen structured with a\nballoon payment, which\nrequires full\nrepayment of the\noutstanding balance at\nthe end of the term\nperiod. The conversion\nof lines or loans to\nfully amortizing or\nballoon payoff may\nresult in a\nsignificant payment\nincrease, which can\naffect some borrowers\u2019\nability to repay the\noutstanding balance.\n\nOn a monthly basis, we\nmonitor the payment\ncharacteristics of\nborrowers in our first\nand junior lien lines\nof credit portfolios.\nIn September 2020,\nexcluding borrowers\nwith COVID-related\nloan modification\npayment deferrals,\napproximately 43% of\nborrowers paid the\nminimum amount due and\napproximately 52% paid\nmore than the minimum\namount due. The rest\nwere either delinquent\nor paid less than the\nminimum amount due.\nFor the borrowers with\nan interest-only\npayment feature,\napproximately 28% paid\nthe minimum amount due\nand approximately 67%\npaid more than the\nminimum amount due.\n\nThe lines that enter\ntheir amortization\nperiod may experience\nhigher delinquencies\nand higher loss rates\nthan the ones in their\ndraw or term period.\nWe have considered\nthis increased\ninherent risk in our\nallowance for credit\nloss estimate.\n\nIn anticipation of our\nborrowers reaching the\nend of their\ncontractual\ncommitment, we have\ncreated a program to\ninform, educate and\nhelp these borrowers\ntransition from\ninterest-only to\nfully-amortizing\npayments or full\nrepayment. We monitor\nthe performance of the\nborrowers moving\nthrough the program in\nan effort to refine\nour ongoing program\nstrategy.\n                                            33\nRisk Management \u2013\nCredit Risk Management\n(continued)\n\nTable 17 reflects the\noutstanding balance of\nour portfolio of\njunior lien mortgages,\nincluding lines and\nloans, and first lien\nlines segregated into\nscheduled end-of-draw\nor end-of-term periods\nand products that are\ncurrently amortizing,\nor in balloon\nrepayment status.

The\ndecrease in the net\ncharge-off rate in the\nthird quarter and\nfirst nine months of\n2020, compared with\nthe same periods a\nyear ago, was driven\nby payment deferral\nactivities in response\nto the COVID-19\npandemic and the\neffects of government\nstimulus programs.\n\nAUTOMOBILE Our\nautomobile portfolio\ntotaled $48.5 billion\nat September 30, 2020.\nThe net charge-off\nrate (annualized) for\nour automobile\nportfolio was 0.25%\nfor third quarter\n2020, compared with\n0.65% for third\nquarter 2019, and\n0.60% and 0.64% for\nthe first nine months\nof 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. The\ndecrease in the net\ncharge-off rate in the\nthird quarter and\nfirst nine months of\n2020, compared with\nthe same periods in\n2019, was driven by\npayment deferral\nactivities in response\nto the COVID-19\npandemic and stronger\nrecoveries from higher\nused car values.\n\nOTHER REVOLVING CREDIT\nAND INSTALLMENT Other\nrevolving credit and\ninstallment loans\ntotaled $33.2 billion\nat September 30, 2020,\nand predominantly\nincluded student and\nsecurities-based\nloans.

The\ndecrease in the net\ncharge-off rate in the\nthird quarter and\nfirst nine months of\n2020, compared with\nthe same periods a\nyear ago, was driven\nby payment deferral\nactivities in response\nto the COVID-19\npandemic.\n\n34\n\nNONPERFORMING ASSETS\n(NONACCRUAL LOANS AND\nFORECLOSED ASSETS)\nTable 18 summarizes\nnonperforming assets\n(NPAs) for each of the\nlast four quarters.\nTotal NPAs increased\n$378 million from\nsecond quarter 2020 to\n$8.2 billion.\nNonaccrual loans of\n$8.0 billion increased\n$417 million from\nsecond quarter 2020.\nThe increase in\nnonaccrual loans was\ndue to the economic\nimpact of the COVID-19\npandemic, including\nreal estate 1-4 family\nmortgage loans in\nCOVID-related payment\ndeferral programs that\nwere classified as\nnonaccrual because\nthey did not qualify\nfor legislative or\nregulatory relief.\nCustomer payment\ndeferral activities\ninstituted in response\nto the COVID-19\npandemic may delay\nrecognition of\ndelinquencies for\ncustomers who\notherwise would have\nmoved into nonaccrual\nstatus. Prior to\nJanuary 1, 2020, PCI\nloans were excluded\nfrom nonaccrual loans\nbecause they continued\nto earn interest\nincome from accretable\nyield, independent of\nperformance in\naccordance with their\ncontractual terms.\nHowever, as a result\nof our adoption of\nCECL on January 1,\n\n2020, $275 million of\nreal estate 1-4 family\nmortgage loans were\nreclassified from PCI\nto PCD loans, and as a\nresult, were also\nclassified as\nnonaccrual loans given\ntheir contractual\ndelinquency.

Of\nthe consumer\nnonaccrual loans, 94%\nare secured by real\nestate and 90% have a\ncombined LTV (CLTV)\nratio of 80% or less.\n\n\u2022 losses of $701\nmillion and $1.0\nbillion have already\nbeen recognized on 18%\nof commercial\nnonaccrual loans and\n32% of consumer\nnonaccrual loans,\nrespectively, in\naccordance with our\ncharge-off policies.\nOnce we write down\nloans to the net\nrealizable value (fair\nvalue of collateral\nless estimated costs\nto sell), we re-\nevaluate each loan\nregularly and record\nadditional write-downs\nif needed.\n\n\u2022 74% of commercial\nnonaccrual loans were\ncurrent on interest\nand 70% of commercial\nnonaccrual loans were\ncurrent on both\nprincipal and\ninterest, but were on\nnonaccrual status\nbecause the full or\ntimely collection of\ninterest or principal\nhad become uncertain.\n\n\u2022 of the $1.3 billion\nof consumer loans in\nbankruptcy or\ndischarged in\nbankruptcy, and\nclassified as\nnonaccrual, $848\nmillion were current.\n\n\u2022 the remaining risk\nof loss of all\nnonaccrual loans has\nbeen considered in\ndeveloping our\nallowance for loan\nlosses.\n\nWe continue to work\nwith our customers\nexperiencing financial\ndifficulty to\ndetermine if they can\nqualify for a loan\nmodification so that\nthey can stay in their\nhomes. Under our\nproprietary\nmodification programs,\ncustomers may be\nrequired to provide\nupdated documentation,\nand some programs\nrequire completion of\npayment during trial\nperiods to demonstrate\nsustained performance\nbefore the loan can be\nremoved from\nnonaccrual status.\n\n36\n\nTable 20 provides a\nsummary of foreclosed\nassets and an analysis\nof changes in\nforeclosed assets.\n                                              \n  Table 20:                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  Foreclosed Assets                           \n                                              \n                                              \n            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026         \n            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026         \n            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n      $  \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026    \n      $  \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026    \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026    \n         \u2026       2       3       \u2026       \u2026    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026    \n      $  \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) Foreclosed\ngovernment\ninsured/guaranteed\nloans are temporarily\ntransferred to and\nheld by us as\nservicer, until\nreimbursement is\nreceived from FHA or\nVA.\n\n(2) Includes loans\nmoved into foreclosed\nassets from nonaccrual\nstatus and repossessed\nautomobiles.\n\nForeclosed assets at\nSeptember 30, 2020,\nincluded $104 million\nof foreclosed\nresidential real\nestate, of which 21%\nis predominantly FHA\ninsured or VA\nguaranteed and\nexpected to have\nminimal or no loss\ncontent.

For\nadditional\ninformation, see Note\n1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial\nStatements in this\nReport.\n\n(2) Total net loan\ncharge-offs are\nannualized for the\nquarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2020.\n\nThe ratios for the\nallowance for loan\nlosses and the ACL for\nloans presented in\nTable 25 may fluctuate\nfrom period to period\ndue to such factors as\nthe mix of loan types\nin the portfolio,\nborrower credit\nstrength, and the\nvalue and\nmarketability of\ncollateral.\n\nThe ACL for loans\nincreased $10.0\nbillion, or 96%, from\nDecember 31, 2019,\ndriven by a $11.3\nbillion increase in\nthe ACL for loans in\nthe first nine months\nof 2020 reflecting\ncurrent and forecasted\neconomic conditions\ndue to the COVID-19\npandemic, partially\noffset by a $1.3\nbillion decrease as a\nresult of adopting\nCECL. Total provision\nfor credit losses for\nloans was $751 million\nin third quarter 2020,\ncompared with $695\nmillion in third\nquarter 2019. The\nincrease in the\nprovision for credit\nlosses for loans in\nthird quarter 2020,\ncompared with the same\nperiod a year ago,\nreflected an increase\nin the ACL for loans\ndue to the economic\nimpact of the COVID-19\npandemic.\n\nWe consider multiple\neconomic scenarios to\ndevelop our estimate\nof the ACL for loans.\nThe scenarios include\na base case considered\nto be the most likely\neconomic forecast,\nalong with an\noptimistic (upside)\nand a pessimistic\n(downside) economic\nforecast. Our estimate\nof the ACL for loans\nat September 30, 2020,\nwas based on a\nweighting of the base\ncase and downside\n\neconomic scenarios of\n80% and 20%,\nrespectively, with no\nweighting applied to\nthe upside scenario.\nThe base case economic\nforecast assumed near-\nterm economic stress\nrecovering into late\n2021. The downside\nscenario assumed more\nsustained adverse\neconomic impacts\nresulting from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\ncompared with the base\ncase. The downside\nscenario assumed U.S.\nreal GDP increasing\nslowly and not fully\nrecovering during the\nremainder of 2020 and\n2021, and a sustained\nelevation in the U.S.\nunemployment rate\nuntil mid-2022. We\nconsidered\nexpectations for the\nimpact of government\neconomic stimulus\nprograms in effect on\nSeptember 30, 2020;\nhowever, we did not\nconsider the impact of\nfuture government\neconomic stimulus\nprograms. In addition,\nwe considered\nexpectations for the\nimpact of customer\naccommodation\nactivity, as well as\nthe estimated impact\non certain industries\nthat we consider to be\ndirectly and most\nadversely affected by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn addition to\nquantitative\nestimates, we consider\nqualitative factors\nthat represent risks\ninherent in our\nprocesses and\nassumptions such as\neconomic environmental\nfactors, modeling\nassumptions and\nperform ance, and\nother subjective\nfactors, including\nindustry trends and\nemerging risk\nassessments. The\nforecasted key\neconomic variables\nused in our estimate\nof the\n\n42\n\nACL for loans\ngenerally reflected\nimprovement from our\nprior expectations\nresulting in lower\nloss expectations in\nthe quantitative\ncomponent of our ACL\nfor loans at September\n30, 2020. However, we\nsignificantly\nincreased the\nqualitative component\nof our ACL for loans\nat September 30, 2020,\nto consider the\nsignificant\nuncertainty related to\nthe duration and\nseverity of the\neconomic impacts from\nthe COVID-19 pandemic\nand the incremental\nrisks to our loan\nportfolio, including\nspecifically impacted\nindustries in our\ncommercial loan\nportfolio. The\nforecasted key\neconomic variables\nused in our estimate\nof the ACL for loans\nat June 30 and\nSeptember 30, 2020,\nare presented in Table\n26.

(2)\nQuarterly average. (3) Percent change from the\npreceding period, seasonally adjusted\nannualized rate. (4) Percent change year over\nyear of national average; outlook differs by\ngeography and property type. Future amounts of\nthe ACL for loans will be based on a variety\nof factors, including loan balance changes,\nportfolio credit quality and mix changes, and\nchanges in general economic conditions and\nexpectations (including for unemployment and\nGDP), among other factors. Based on economic\nconditions at the end of third quarter 2020,\nit was difficult to estimate the length and\nseverity of the economic downturn that may\nresult from the COVID-19 pandemic and the\nimpact of other factors that may influence the\nlevel of eventual losses and corresponding\nrequirements for future amounts of the ACL,\nincluding the impact of economic stimulus\nprograms and customer accommodation activity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could continue to result\nin the recognition of credit losses in our\nloan portfolios and increases in our allowance\nfor credit losses, particularly if the impact\non the economy worsens. We believe the ACL for\nloans of $20.5 billion at September 30, 2020,\nwas appropriate to cover expected credit\nlosses, including unfunded credit commitments,\nat that date. The entire allowance is\navailable to absorb expected credit losses\nfrom the total loan portfolio. The ACL for\nloans is subject to change and reflects\nexisting factors as of the date of\ndetermination, including economic or market\nconditions and ongoing internal and external\nexamination processes. Due to the sensitivity\nof the ACL for loans to changes in the\neconomic and business environment, it is\npossible that we will incur incremental credit\nlosses not anticipated as of the balance sheet\ndate. LIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE\nLOSSES For information on our repurchase\nliability, see the \u201cRisk\n\nManagement \u2013 Credit Risk Management \u2013\nLiability For Mortgage Loan Repurchase Losses\u201d\nsection in our 2019 Form 10-K. RISKS RELATING\nTO SERVICING ACTIVITIES In addition to\nservicing loans in our portfolio, we act as\nservicer and/or master servicer of residential\nmortgage loans included in government-\nsponsored entity (GSE)-guaranteed mortgage\nsecuritizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage\nsecuritizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed\nmortgages and private label mortgage\nsecuritizations, as well as for unsecuritized\nloans owned by institutional investors. In\nconnection with our servicing activities, we\ncould become subject to consent orders and\nsettlement agreements with federal and state\nregulators for alleged servicing issues and\npractices. In general, these can require us to\nprovide customers with loan modification\nrelief, refinancing relief, and foreclosure\nprevention and assistance, and can result in\nthe imposition of certain monetary penalties.\nAs a servicer, we are required to advance\ncertain delinquent payments of principal and\ninterest on mortgage loans we service. The\namount and timing of reimbursement of these\nadvances vary by investor and the applicable\nservicing agreements. Due to continued\ncustomer requests for payment deferrals as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic, the amount of\nour servicing advances of principal and\ninterest remained elevated in third quarter\n2020. The amount of these advances may\ncontinue to increase if additional payment\ndeferrals are provided. Payment deferrals also\ndelay the collection of contractually\nspecified servicing fees, resulting in lower\nnet servicing income. In accordance with\napplicable servicing guidelines, delinquency\nstatus continues to advance for loans with\nCOVID-related payment deferrals, which has\nresulted in an increase in delinquent loans\nserviced for others and a corresponding\nincrease in loans eligible for repurchase from\nGNMA loan securitization pools. Our option to\nrepurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization\npools becomes exercisable when three scheduled\nloan payments remain unpaid by the borrower.\nWe generally repurchase these loans for cash\nand as a result, our total consolidated assets\ndo not change. In third quarter 2020, we\nrepurchased $21.9 billion of these delinquent\nloans, substantially all of which had COVID-\nrelated payment deferrals. Loans that regain\ncurrent status or are otherwise modified in\naccordance with applicable servicing\nguidelines may be included in future GNMA loan\nsecuritization pools. However, in accordance\nwith guidance issued by GNMA, loans\nrepurchased after June 30, 2020 with COVID-\nrelated payment deferrals are ineligible for\ninclusion in future GNMA loan securitization\npools until the borrower has timely made six\nconsecutive payments. This requirement may\ndelay our ability to resell loans into the\nsecuritization market. At September 30, 2020,\nthe amount of repurchased GNMA loans with\nCOVID-related payment deferrals that were\nineligible for inclusion in future GNMA loan\nsecuritization pools due to this requirement\nwas $21.0 billion. For additional information\nabout the risks related to our servicing\nactivities, see the \u201cRisk Management \u2013 Credit\nRisk Management \u2013 Risks Relating to Servicing\nActivities\u201d section in our 2019 Form 10-K. For\nadditional information on mortgage banking\nactivities, see Note 11 (Mortgage Banking\nActivities) to Financial Statements in this\nReport. Asset/Liability Management\nAsset/liability management involves\nevaluating, monitoring and managing interest\nrate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding.\nPrimary oversight of interest rate risk and\nmarket risk resides with the Finance Committee\nof our Board, which oversees the\nadministration and effectiveness of financial\nrisk management\n                                            43\n                                              \n  Asset/Liability Management (continued)      \n                                              \npolicies and processes\nused to assess and\nmanage these risks.\nPrimary oversight of\nliquidity and funding\nresides with the Risk\nCommittee of the\nBoard. At the\nmanagement level we\nutilize a Corporate\nAsset/Liability\nCommittee (Corporate\nALCO), which consists\nof management from\nfinance, risk and\nbusiness groups, to\noversee these risks\nand provide periodic\nreports to the Board\u2019s\nFinance Committee and\nRisk Committee as\nappropriate. As\ndiscussed in more\ndetail for market risk\nactivities below, we\nemploy separate\nmanagement level\noversight specific to\nmarket risk. INTEREST\nRATE RISK Interest\nrate risk, which\npotentially can have a\nsignificant earnings\nimpact, is an integral\npart of being a\nfinancial\nintermediary. We are\nsubject to interest\nrate risk because: \u2022\nassets and liabilities\nmay mature or reprice\nat different times\n(for example, if\nassets reprice faster\nthan liabilities and\ninterest rates are\ngenerally rising,\nearnings will\ninitially increase); \u2022\nassets and liabilities\nmay reprice at the\nsame time but by\ndifferent amounts (for\nexample, when the\ngeneral level of\ninterest rates is\nrising, we may\nincrease rates paid on\nchecking and savings\ndeposit accounts by an\namount that is less\nthan the general rise\nin market interest\nrates); \u2022 short-term\nand long-term market\ninterest rates may\nchange by different\namounts (for example,\nthe shape of the yield\ncurve may affect new\nloan yields and\nfunding costs\ndifferently); \u2022 the\nremaining maturity of\nvarious assets or\nliabilities may\nshorten or lengthen as\ninterest rates change\n(for example, if long-\nterm mortgage interest\nrates increase\nsharply, MBS held in\nthe debt securities\nportfolio may pay down\nslower than\nanticipated, which\ncould impact portfolio\nincome); or \u2022 interest\nrates may also have a\ndirect or indirect\neffect on loan demand,\ncollateral values,\ncredit losses,\nmortgage origination\nvolume, the fair value\nof MSRs and other\nfinancial instruments,\nthe value of the\npension liability and\nother items affecting\nearnings. We assess\ninterest rate risk by\ncomparing outcomes\nunder various net\ninterest income\nsimulations using many\ninterest rate\nscenarios that differ\nin the direction of\ninterest rate changes,\nthe degree of change\nover time, the speed\nof change and the\nprojected shape of the\nyield curve. These\nsimulations require\nassumptions regarding\ndrivers of earnings\nand balance sheet\ncomposition such as\nloan originations,\nprepayment speeds on\nloans and debt\nsecurities, deposit\nflows and mix, as well\nas pricing strategies.\nCurrently, our profile\nis such that we\nproject net interest\nincome will benefit\nfrom higher interest\nrates as our assets\nwould reprice faster\nand to a greater\ndegree than our\nliabilities, while in\nthe case of lower\ninterest rates, our\nassets would reprice\ndownward and to a\ngreater degree than\nour liabilities. Our\nmost recent\nsimulations estimate\nnet interest income\nsensitivity over the\nnext two years under a\nrange of both lower\nand higher interest\nrates. Measured\nimpacts from\nstandardized ramps\n(gradual changes) and\nshocks (instantaneous\nchanges) are\nsummarized in Table\n27, indicating net\ninterest income\nsensitivity relative\nto the Company\u2019s base\nnet interest income\nplan. Ramp scenarios\nassume interest rates\nmove gradually in\nparallel across the\nyield curve relative\nto the base scenario\nin year one, and the\nfull amount of the\nramp is held as a\nconstant differential\nto the base scenario\nin year two. The\nfollowing describes\nthe simulation\nassumptions for the\nscenarios presented in\nTable 27:\n\n\u2022 Simulations are\ndynamic and reflect\nanticipated growth\nacross assets and\nliabilities. \u2022 Other\nmacroeconomic\nvariables that could\nbe correlated with the\nchanges in interest\nrates are held\nconstant. \u2022 Mortgage\nprepayment and\norigination\nassumptions vary\nacross scenarios and\nreflect only the\nimpact of the higher\nor lower interest\nrates. \u2022 Our base\nscenario deposit\nforecast incorporates\nmix changes consistent\nwith the base interest\nrate trajectory.\nDeposit mix is modeled\nto be the same as in\nthe base scenario\nacross the alternative\nscenarios. In higher\ninterest rate\nscenarios, customer\nactivity that shifts\nbalances into higher-\nyielding products\ncould reduce expected\nnet interest income. \u2022\nWe hold the size of\nthe projected debt and\nequity securities\nportfolios constant\nacross scenarios.\nTable 27: Net Interest\nIncome Sensitivity\nOver Next Two-Year\nHorizon Relative to\nBase Expectation\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) U.S. interest\nrates are floored at\nzero where applicable\nin this scenario\nanalysis (2) U.S.\nConstant Maturity\nTreasury Rate The\nsensitivity results\nabove do not capture\ninterest rate\nsensitive noninterest\nincome and expense\nimpacts. Our interest\nrate sensitive\nnoninterest income and\nexpense are\npredominantly driven\nby mortgage banking\nactivities, and may\nmove in the opposite\ndirection of our net\ninterest income.\nMortgage originations\ngenerally decline in\nresponse to higher\ninterest rates and\ngenerally increase,\nparticularly\nrefinancing activity,\nin response to lower\ninterest rates.\nMortgage results are\nalso impacted by the\nvaluation of MSRs and\nrelated hedge\npositions. See the\n\u201cRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Mortgage\nBanking Interest Rate\nand Market Risk\u201d\nsection in this Report\nfor additional\ninformation. Interest\nrate sensitive\nnoninterest income\nalso results from\nchanges in earnings\ncredit for\nnoninterest-bearing\ndeposits that reduce\ntreasury management\ndeposit service fees.\nAdditionally, for the\ntrading portfolio, our\ntrading assets are\n(before the effects of\ncertain economic\nhedges) generally less\nsensitive to changes\nin interest rates than\nthe related funding\nliabilities. As a\nresult, net interest\nincome from the\ntrading portfolio\ncontracts and expands\nas interest rates rise\nand fall,\nrespectively. The\nimpact to net interest\nincome does not\ninclude the fair value\nchanges of trading\nsecurities and loans,\nwhich, along with the\neffects of related\neconomic hedges, are\nrecorded in\nnoninterest income. We\nuse the debt\nsecurities portfolio\nand exchange-traded\nand over-the-counter\n(OTC) interest rate\nderivatives to hedge\n\n44\n\nour interest rate\nexposures. See the\n\u201cBalance Sheet\nAnalysis \u2013 Available-\nfor-Sale and Held-to-\nMaturity Debt\nSecurities\u201d section in\nthis Report for\nadditional information\non the use of the\navailable-for-sale and\nheld-to-maturity\nsecurities portfolios.\nThe notional or\ncontractual amount,\ncredit risk amount and\nfair value of the\nderivatives used to\nhedge our interest\nrate risk exposures as\nof September 30, 2020,\nand December 31, 2019,\nare presented in Note\n15 (Derivatives) to\nFinancial Statements\nin this Report. We use\nderivatives for\nasset/liability\nmanagement in two main\nways:\n\n\u2022 to convert the cash\nflows from selected\nasset and/or liability\ninstruments/portfolios\nincluding investments,\ncommercial loans and\nlong-term debt, from\nfixed-rate payments to\nfloating-rate\npayments, or vice\nversa; and\n\n\u2022 to economically\nhedge our mortgage\norigination pipeline,\nfunded mortgage loans\nand MSRs using\ninterest rate swaps,\nswaptions, futures,\nforwards and options.\n\nMORTGAGE BANKING\nINTEREST RATE AND\nMARKET RISK We\noriginate, fund and\nservice mortgage\nloans, which subjects\nus to various risks,\nincluding credit,\nliquidity and interest\nrate risks. For\nadditional information\non mortgage banking\ninterest rate and\nmarket risk, see the\n\u201cRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Mortgage\nBanking Interest Rate\nand Market Risk\u201d\nsection in our 2019\nForm 10-K.\n\nWhile our hedging\nactivities are\ndesigned to balance\nour mortgage banking\ninterest rate risks,\nthe financial\ninstruments we use may\nnot perfectly\ncorrelate with the\nvalues and income\nbeing hedged. For\nexample, the change in\nthe value of ARM\nproduction held for\nsale from changes in\nmortgage interest\nrates may or may not\nbe fully offset by\nindex-based financial\ninstruments used as\neconomic hedges for\nsuch ARMs. Hedge\nresults may also be\nimpacted as the\noverall level of\nhedges changes as\ninterest rates change,\nor as there are other\nchanges in the market\nfor mortgage forwards\nthat may affect the\nimplied carry on the\nMSRs.\n\nThe total carrying\nvalue of our\nresidential and\ncommercial MSRs was\n$7.7 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2020,\nand $12.9 billion at\nDecember 31, 2019. The\nweighted average note\nrate on our portfolio\nof loans serviced for\nothers was 4.13% at\nSeptember 30, 2020,\nand 4.25% at December\n31, 2019. The carrying\nvalue of our total\nMSRs represented 0.52%\nand 0.79% of mortgage\nloans serviced for\nothers at September\n30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019,\nrespectively.\n\nMARKET RISK Market\nrisk is the risk of\npossible economic loss\nfrom adverse changes\nin market risk factors\nsuch as interest\nrates, credit spreads,\nforeign exchange\nrates, equity and\ncommodity prices, and\nthe risk of possible\nloss due to\ncounterparty exposure.\nThis applies to\nimplied volatility\nrisk, basis risk, and\nmarket liquidity risk.\nIt also includes price\nrisk in the trading\nbook, mortgage\nservicing rights and\nthe hedge\neffectiveness risk\nassociated with the\nmortgage book, and\nimpairment on private\nequity investments.\n\nThe Board\u2019s Finance\nCommittee has primary\noversight\nresponsibility for\nmarket risk and\noversees the Company\u2019s\nmarket risk exposure\nand market risk\nmanagement strategies.\nIn addition, the\nBoard\u2019s Risk Committee\nhas certain oversight\nresponsibilities with\nrespect to market\nrisk, including\nadjusting the\nCompany\u2019s market risk\nappetite with input\nfrom the Finance\nCommittee. The Finance\nCommittee also reports\nkey market risk\nmatters to the Risk\nCommittee.\n\nAt the management\nlevel, the Market and\nCounterparty Risk\nManagement function,\nwhich is part of IRM,\nhas primary oversight\nresponsibility for\nmarket risk. The\nMarket and\nCounterparty Risk\nManagement function\nreports into the CRO\nand also provides\nperiodic reports\nrelated to market risk\nto the Board\u2019s Finance\nCommittee.\n\nMARKET RISK \u2013 TRADING\nACTIVITIES We engage\nin trading activities\nto accommodate the\ninvestment and risk\nmanagement activities\nof our customers and\nto execute economic\nhedging to manage\ncertain balance sheet\nrisks. These trading\nactivities\npredominantly occur\nwithin our Wholesale\nBanking businesses and\nto a lesser extent\nother divisions of the\nCompany. Debt\nsecurities held for\ntrading, equity\nsecurities held for\ntrading, trading loans\nand trading\nderivatives are\nfinancial instruments\nused in our trading\nactivities, and all\nare carried at fair\nvalue. Income earned\non the financial\ninstruments used in\nour trading activities\ninclude net interest\nincome, changes in\nfair value and\nrealized gains and\nlosses. Net interest\nincome earned from our\ntrading activities is\nreflected in the\ninterest income and\ninterest expense\ncomponents of our\nincome statement.\nChanges in fair value\nof the financial\ninstruments used in\nour trading activities\nare reflected in net\ngains on trading\nactivities, a\ncomponent of\nnoninterest income in\nour income statement.\nFor additional\ninformation on the\nfinancial instruments\nused in our trading\nactivities and the\nincome from these\ntrading activities,\nsee Note 4 (Trading\nActivities) to\nFinancial Statements\nin this Report.\n\nValue-at-risk (VaR) is\na statistical risk\nmeasure used to\nestimate the potential\nloss from adverse\nmoves in the financial\nmarkets. The Company\nuses VaR metrics\ncomplemented with\nsensitivity analysis\nand stress testing in\nmeasuring and\nmonitoring market\nrisk. For additional\ninformation, including\ninformation regarding\nour monitoring\nactivities,\nsensitivity analysis\nand stress testing,\nsee the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Market\nRisk \u2013 Trading\nActivities\u201d section in\nour 2019 Form 10-K.\n\nTrading VaR is the\nmeasure used to\nprovide insight into\nthe market risk\nexhibited by the\nCompany\u2019s trading\npositions. The\n\nCompany calculates\nTrading VaR for risk\nmanagement purposes to\nestablish line of\nbusiness and Company-\nwide risk limits.\nTrading VaR is\ncalculated based on\nall trading positions\non our balance sheet.\n\nTable 28 shows the\nCompany\u2019s Trading\nGeneral VaR by risk\ncategory. As presented\nin Table 28, average\nCompany Trading\nGeneral VaR was $153\nmillion for the\nquarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2020,\ncompared with $155\nmillion for the\nquarter ended June 30,\n2020, and $24 million\nfor the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2019.\nThe increase in\naverage as well as\nperiod end Company\nTrading General VaR\nfor the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2020,\ncompared with the\nquarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2019,\nwas driven by market\nvolatility due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, in\nparticular changes in\ninterest rate curves\nand a significant\nwidening of credit\nspreads entering the\n12-month historical\nlookback window used\nto calculate VaR.\n                                            45\n                                              \n  Asset/Liability Management (continued)      \n                                              \nTable 28: Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by\nRisk Category\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) The period-end VaR\nwas less than the sum\nof the VaR components\ndescribed above, which\nis due to portfolio\ndiversification. The\ndiversification effect\narises because the\nrisks are not\nperfectly correlated\ncausing a portfolio of\npositions to usually\nbe less risky than the\nsum of the risks of\nthe positions alone.\nThe diversification\nbenefit is not\nmeaningful for low and\nhigh metrics since\nthey may occur on\ndifferent days.\n\nMARKET RISK \u2013 EQUITY\nSECURITIES We are\ndirectly and\nindirectly affected by\nchanges in the equity\nmarkets. We make and\nmanage direct\ninvestments in start-\nup businesses,\nemerging growth\ncompanies, management\nbuy-outs, acquisitions\nand corporate\nrecapitalizations. We\nalso invest in non-\naffiliated funds that\nmake similar private\nequity investments.\nThese private equity\ninvestments are made\nwithin capital\nallocations approved\nby management and the\nBoard. The Board\u2019s\npolicy is to review\nbusiness developments,\nkey risks and\nhistorical returns for\nthe private equity\ninvestment portfolio\nat least annually.\nManagement reviews\nthese investments at\nleast quarterly and\nassesses them for\npossible other-than-\ntemporary impairment\n(OTTI) and observable\nprice changes. For\nnonmarketable equity\nsecurities, the\nanalysis is based on\nfacts and\ncircumstances of each\nindividual investment\nand the expectations\nfor that investment\u2019s\ncash flows, capital\nneeds, the viability\nof its business model,\nour exit strategy, and\nobservable price\nchanges that are\nsimilar to the\ninvestments held.\nInvestments in\nnonmarketable equity\nsecurities include\nprivate equity\ninvestments accounted\nfor under the equity\nmethod, fair value\nthrough net income,\nand the measurement\nalternative.\n\nIn conjunction with\nthe March 2008 initial\npublic offering (IPO)\nof Visa, Inc. (Visa),\nwe received\napproximately 20.7\nmillion shares of Visa\nClass B common stock,\nthe class which was\napportioned to member\nbanks of Visa at the\ntime of the IPO. To\nmanage our exposure to\nVisa and realize the\nvalue of the\nappreciated Visa\nshares, we\nincrementally sold\nthese shares through a\nseries of sales,\nthereby eliminating\nthis position as of\nSeptember 30, 2015. As\npart of these sales,\nwe agreed to\ncompensate the buyer\nfor any additional\ncontributions to a\nlitigation settlement\nfund for the\nlitigation matters\nassociated with the\nClass B shares we\nsold. Our exposure to\nthis retained\nlitigation risk has\nbeen updated quarterly\nand is reflected on\nour balance sheet. For\nadditional information\nabout the associated\nlitigation matters,\nsee the \u201cInterchange\nLitigation\u201d section in\nNote 14 (Legal\nActions) to Financial\nStatements in this\nReport.\n\nAs part of our\nbusiness to support\nour customers, we\ntrade public equities,\nlisted/OTC equity\nderivatives and\nconvertible bonds. We\nhave parameters that\ngovern these\nactivities. We also\nhave marketable equity\nsecurities that\ninclude investments\nrelating to our\nventure capital\nactivities. We manage\nthese marketable\nequity securities\nwithin capital risk\nlimits approved by\nmanagement and the\nBoard and monitored by\nCorporate ALCO and the\nMarket Risk Committee.\nThe fair value changes\nin these marketable\nequity securities are\nrecognized in net\nincome. For additional\ninformation, see Note\n8 (Equity Securities)\nto Financial\nStatements in this\nReport.\n\nChanges in equity\nmarket prices may also\nindirectly affect our\nnet income by (1) the\nvalue of third party\nassets under\nmanagement and, hence,\nfee income, (2)\nborrowers whose\nability to repay\nprincipal and/or\ninterest may be\naffected by the stock\nmarket, or (3)\nbrokerage activity,\nrelated commission\nincome and other\nbusiness activities.\nEach business line\nmonitors and manages\nthese indirect risks.\n\n46\n\nLIQUIDITY AND FUNDING\nThe objective of\neffective liquidity\nmanagement is to\nensure that we can\nmeet customer loan\nrequests, customer\ndeposit\nmaturities/withdrawals\nand other cash\ncommitments\nefficiently under both\nnormal operating\nconditions and under\nperiods of Wells\nFargo-specific and/or\nmarket stress. To\nachieve this\nobjective, the Board\nestablishes liquidity\nguidelines that\nrequire sufficient\nasset-based liquidity\nto cover potential\nfunding requirements\nand to avoid over-\ndependence on\nvolatile, less\nreliable funding\nmarkets. These\nguidelines are\nmonitored on a monthly\nbasis by the Corporate\nALCO and on a\nquarterly basis by the\nBoard. These\nguidelines are\nestablished and\nmonitored for both the\nconsolidated company\nand for the Parent on\na stand-alone basis to\nensure that the Parent\nis a source of\nstrength for its\nregulated, deposit-\ntaking banking\nsubsidiaries.\nLiquidity Standards We\nare subject to a rule,\nissued by the FRB, OCC\nand Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\n(FDIC), that includes\na quantitative\nliquidity requirement\nconsistent with the\nliquidity coverage\nratio (LCR)\nestablished by the\nBasel Committee on\nBanking Supervision\n(BCBS). The rule\nrequires banking\ninstitutions, such as\nWells Fargo, to hold\nhigh-quality liquid\nassets (HQLA),\npredominantly\nconsisting of central\nbank deposits,\ngovernment debt\nsecurities, and\nmortgage-backed\nsecurities of federal\nagencies that can be\nconverted easily and\nquickly into cash, in\nan amount equal to or\ngreater than its\nprojected net cash\noutflows during a\n30-day stress period.\nThe rule is applicable\nto the Company on a\nconsolidated basis and\nto our insured\ndepository\ninstitutions (IDIs)\nwith total assets\ngreater than $10\nbillion. In addition,\nrules issued by the\nFRB impose enhanced\nliquidity management\nstandards on large\nBHCs such as Wells\nFargo. The FRB, OCC\nand FDIC have issued a\nrule implementing a\nstable funding\nrequirement, known as\nthe net stable funding\nratio (NSFR), which\nwill require large\nbanking organizations,\nincluding Wells Fargo,\nto maintain a\nsufficient amount of\navailable stable\nfunding, such as\ncommon equity, long-\nterm subordinated debt\nand most types of\ndeposits, in relation\nto their assets,\nderivative exposures\nand commitments over a\none-year horizon\nperiod. The rule will\nbecome effective on\nJuly 1, 2021.\nLiquidity Coverage\nRatio As of September\n30, 2020, the\nconsolidated Company,\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A.\nand Wells Fargo\n\nNational Bank West\nwere above the minimum\nLCR requirement of\n100%, which is\ncalculated as HQLA\ndivided by projected\nnet cash outflows, as\neach is defined under\nthe LCR rule.

Any\nincrease in the\nminimum investment\nrequirements outside\nof specified ranges\nrequires the approval\nof the Federal Housing\nFinance Agency.\nBecause the extent of\nany obligation to\nincrease our\ninvestment in any of\nthe FHLBs depends\nentirely upon the\noccurrence of a future\nevent, potential\nfuture payments to the\nFHLBs are not\ndeterminable.\n                                            49\n                      \n  Capital Management  \n                      \nWe have an active\nprogram for managing\ncapital through a\ncomprehensive process\nfor assessing the\nCompany\u2019s overall\ncapital adequacy. Our\nobjective is to\nmaintain capital at an\namount commensurate\nwith our risk profile\nand risk tolerance\nobjectives, and to\nmeet both regulatory\nand market\nexpectations. We\nprimarily fund our\nworking capital needs\nthrough the retention\nof earnings net of\nboth dividends and\nshare repurchases, as\nwell as through the\nissuance of preferred\nstock and long and\nshort-term debt.\nRetained earnings at\nSeptember 30, 2020,\ndecreased $5.8 billion\nfrom December 31,\n2019, predominantly as\na result of common and\npreferred stock\ndividends of $5.6\nbillion. During third\nquarter 2020, we\nissued $325 million of\ncommon stock,\nexcluding conversions\nof preferred shares.\nOn September 30, 2020,\nthe Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve\nSystem (FRB) announced\nthat it was extending\nthrough fourth quarter\n2020 measures it\nannounced on June 25,\n2020, prohibiting\nlarge bank holding\ncompanies (BHCs)\nsubject to the FRB\u2019s\ncapital plan rule,\nincluding Wells Fargo,\nfrom making capital\ndistributions, subject\nto certain limited\nexceptions.

The\nfederal banking\nregulators\u2019 capital\nrules, among other\nthings, required on a\nfully phased-in basis\nas of September 30,\n2020:\n\n\u2022 a minimum Common\nEquity Tier 1 (CET1)\nratio of 9.00%,\ncomprised of a 4.50%\nminimum requirement\nplus a capital\nconservation buffer of\n2.50% and for us, as a\nglobal systemically\nimportant bank\n(G-SIB), a capital\nsurcharge of 2.00%;\n\n\u2022 a minimum tier 1\ncapital ratio of\n10.50%, comprised of a\n6.00% minimum\nrequirement plus the\ncapital conservation\nbuffer of 2.50% and\nthe G-SIB capital\nsurcharge of 2.00%;\n\n\u2022 a minimum total\ncapital ratio of\n12.50%, comprised of a\n8.00% minimum\nrequirement plus the\ncapital conservation\nbuffer of 2.50% and\nthe G-SIB capital\nsurcharge of 2.00%;\n\n\u2022 a potential\ncountercyclical buffer\nof up to 2.50% to be\nadded to the minimum\nrisk-based capital\nratios, which could be\nimposed by regulators\nat their discretion if\nit is determined that\na period of excessive\ncredit growth is\ncontributing to an\nincrease in systemic\nrisk; and\n\n\u2022 a minimum tier 1\nleverage ratio of\n4.00%.\n\nThe Basel III capital\nrequirements for\ncalculating CET1 and\ntier 1 capital, along\nwith risk-weighted\nassets (RWAs), are\nfully phased-in.\nHowever, the\nrequirements for\ndetermining tier 2 and\ntotal capital are\nstill in accordance\nwith Transition\nRequirements and are\nscheduled to be fully\nphased-in by the end\nof 2021. The Basel III\ncapital rules contain\ntwo frameworks for\ncalculating capital\nrequirements, a\nStandardized Approach\nand an Advanced\nApproach applicable to\ncertain institutions,\nincluding Wells Fargo.\nOur capital adequacy\nis assessed based on\nthe lower of our risk-\nbased capital ratios\ncalculated under the\nStandardized Approach\nand under the Advanced\nApproach. The\ndifference between\nRWAs under the\nStandardized and\nAdvanced Approach has\nnarrowed in recent\nquarters due to\neconomic conditions\nfrom the COVID-19\npandemic impacting our\ncalculation of\nAdvanced Approach\nRWAs. In particular,\nchanges in internal\ncredit ratings in our\nloan portfolio\ncontributed to an\nincrease in our\nAdvanced Approach RWAs\nat September 30, 2020.\nWe expect this trend\nto continue if the\neconomic impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\ncontinues to affect\nour customer base.\n\nEffective October 1,\n2020, a stress capital\nbuffer replaced the\n2.50% capital\nconservation buffer\nunder the Standardized\nApproach. The stress\ncapital buffer is\ncalculated based on\nthe decrease in a\nBHC\u2019s risk-based\ncapital ratios under\nthe severely adverse\nscenario in the FRB\u2019s\nannual supervisory\nstress test and\nrelated Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and\nReview (CCAR), plus\nfour quarters of\nplanned common stock\ndividends. On August\n10, 2020, the FRB\nannounced that the\nCompany's stress\ncapital buffer for the\nperiod October 1,\n2020, through\nSeptember 30, 2021, is\n2.50%. Because the\nstress capital buffer\nis calculated annually\nas part of the FRB\u2019s\nsupervisory stress\ntest and related CCAR\nand will be based on\ndata that can differ\nover time, our stress\ncapital buffer, and\nthus the regulatory\nminimums for our risk-\nbased capital ratios,\nare subject to change\nin future years.\n\nAs a G-SIB, we are\nalso subject to the\nFRB\u2019s rule\nimplementing the\nadditional capital\nsurcharge of between\n1.00-4.50% on the\nminimum capital\nrequirements of\nG-SIBs. Under the\nrule, we must annually\ncalculate our\nsurcharge under two\nmethods and use the\nhigher of the two\nsurcharges.

Our\nIDIs are required to\nmaintain a SLR of at\nleast 6.00% to be\nconsidered well-\ncapitalized under\napplicable regulatory\ncapital adequacy\nguidelines. In April\n2018, the FRB and OCC\nproposed rules\n(Proposed SLR rules)\nthat would replace the\n2.00% supplementary\nleverage buffer with a\nbuffer equal to one-\nhalf of our G-SIB\ncapital surcharge. The\nProposed SLR rules\nwould similarly tailor\nthe current 6.00% SLR\nrequirement for our\nIDIs. In April 2020,\nthe FRB issued an\ninterim final rule\nthat temporarily\nallows a BHC to\nexclude on-balance\nsheet amounts of U.S.\nTreasury securities\nand deposits at\nFederal Reserve Banks\nfrom the calculation\nof its total leverage\nexposure in the\ndenominator of the\nSLR. This interim\nfinal rule became\neffective on April 1,\n2020, and expires on\nMarch 31, 2021. In May\n2020, federal banking\nregulators issued an\ninterim final rule\nthat permits IDIs to\nchoose to similarly\nexclude these items\nfrom the denominator\nof their SLRs;\nhowever, if an IDI\nchooses to exclude\nsuch amounts from the\ncalculation of its\nSLR, it will be\nrequired to request\napproval from its\nprimary federal\nbanking regulator\nbefore making capital\ndistributions, such as\npaying dividends, to\nits parent company.

TOTAL LOSS ABSORBING CAPACITY As a\nG-SIB, we are required to have a minimum\namount of equity and unsecured long-term debt\nfor purposes of resolvability and resiliency,\noften referred to as Total Loss Absorbing\nCapacity (TLAC). U.S. G-SIBs are required to\nhave a minimum TLAC amount (consisting of CET1\ncapital and additional tier 1 capital issued\ndirectly by the top-tier or covered BHC plus\neligible external long-term debt) equal to the\ngreater of (i) 18.00% of RWAs and (ii) 7.50%\nof total leverage exposure (the denominator of\nthe SLR calculation). Additionally, U.S.\nG-SIBs are required to maintain (i) a TLAC\nbuffer equal to 2.50% of RWAs plus our\napplicable G-SIB capital surcharge calculated\nunder\n\nmethod one plus any applicable countercyclical\nbuffer to be added to the 18.00% minimum and\n(ii) an external TLAC leverage buffer equal to\n2.00% of total leverage exposure to be added\nto the 7.50% minimum, in order to avoid\nrestrictions on capital distributions and\ndiscretionary bonus payments. U.S. G-SIBs are\nalso required to have a minimum amount of\neligible unsecured long-term debt equal to the\ngreater of (i) 6.00% of RWAs plus our\napplicable G-SIB capital surcharge calculated\nunder method two and (ii) 4.50% of the total\nleverage exposure. Under the Proposed SLR\nrules, the 2.00% external TLAC leverage buffer\nwould be replaced with a buffer equal to one-\nhalf of our applicable G-SIB capital\nsurcharge, and the leverage component for\ncalculating the minimum amount of eligible\nunsecured long-term debt would be modified\nfrom 4.50% of total leverage exposure to 2.50%\nof total leverage exposure plus one-half of\nour applicable G-SIB capital surcharge. As of\nSeptember 30, 2020, our eligible external TLAC\nas a percentage of total risk-weighted assets\nwas 25.76% compared with a required minimum of\n22.00%. Similar to the risk-based capital\nrequirements, our minimum TLAC requirement is\nassessed based on the greater of RWAs\ndetermined under the Standardized and Advanced\napproaches. OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND\nLIQUIDITY MATTERS As discussed in the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Asset/ Liability Management \u2013\nLiquidity and Funding \u2013 Liquidity Standards\u201d\nsection in this Report, federal banking\nregulators have issued a final rule regarding\nthe U.S. implementation of the Basel III LCR\nand a proposed rule regarding the NSFR.\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing Our\nplanned long-term capital structure is\ndesigned to meet regulatory and market\nexpectations. We believe that our long-term\ntargeted capital structure enables us to\ninvest in and grow our business, satisfy our\ncustomers\u2019 financial needs in varying\nenvironments, access markets, and maintain\nflexibility to return capital to our\nshareholders. Our long-term targeted capital\nstructure also considers capital levels\nsufficient to exceed capital requirements\nincluding the G-SIB capital surcharge.\nAccordingly, based on the final Basel III\ncapital rules under the lower of the\nStandardized or Advanced Approaches CET1\ncapital ratios, we currently target a long-\nterm CET1 capital ratio at or in excess of\n10.00%, which includes a 2.00% G-SIB capital\nsurcharge. Our capital targets are subject to\nchange based on various factors, including\nchanges to the regulatory capital framework\nand expectations for large banks promulgated\nby bank regulatory agencies, changes to the\nregulatory minimums for our capital ratios\n(including changes to our stress capital\nbuffer), planned capital actions, changes in\nour risk profile and other factors. Under the\nFRB\u2019s capital plan rule, large BHCs are\nrequired to submit capital plans annually for\nreview to determine if the FRB has any\nobjections before making any capital\ndistributions. The rule requires updates to\ncapital plans in the event of material changes\nin a BHC\u2019s risk profile, including as a result\nof any significant acquisitions. The FRB\nassesses, among other things, the overall\nfinancial condition, risk profile, and capital\nadequacy of BHCs when evaluating capital\nplans. Our 2020 capital plan, which was\nsubmitted on April 3, 2020, as part of CCAR,\nincluded a comprehensive capital outlook\nsupported by an assessment of expected sources\nand uses of capital over a given planning\nhorizon under a range of expected and stress\nscenarios. As part of the 2020 CCAR, the FRB\nalso generated a supervisory stress test,\nwhich assumed a sharp decline in the economy\nand significant decline in asset pricing using\nthe information provided by the Company to\nestimate performance. The FRB reviewed the\nsupervisory stress test\n                                            55\n                                              \n  Capital Management (continued)              \n                                              \nresults both as\nrequired under the\nDodd-Frank Act using a\ncommon set of capital\nactions for all large\nBHCs and by taking\ninto account the\nCompany\u2019s proposed\ncapital actions. The\nFRB published its\nsupervisory stress\ntest results as\nrequired under the\nDodd-Frank Act on June\n25, 2020.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the\nFRB also announced\nthat it was requiring\nlarge BHCs, including\nWells Fargo, to update\nand resubmit their\ncapital plans within\n45 days after the FRB\nprovides updated\nscenarios. The FRB\nreleased the updated\nscenarios on September\n17, 2020, and has\nannounced that it will\nrelease BHC-specific\nresults under the\nupdated scenarios by\nthe end of 2020.\n\nOn September 30, 2020,\nthe FRB announced that\nit was extending\nthrough fourth quarter\n2020 measures it\nannounced on June 25,\n2020, prohibiting\nlarge BHCs subject to\nthe FRB's capital plan\nrule, including Wells\nFargo, from making any\ncapital distribution\n(excluding any capital\ndistribution arising\nfrom the issuance of a\ncapital instrument\neligible for inclusion\nin the numerator of a\nregulatory capital\nratio), unless\notherwise approved by\nthe FRB. The FRB has\ngenerally authorized\nBHCs to (i) make share\nrepurchases relating\nto issuances of common\nstock related to\nemployee stock\nownership plans; (ii)\nprovided that the BHC\ndoes not increase the\namount of its common\nstock dividends, pay\ncommon stock dividends\nthat do not exceed an\namount equal to the\naverage of the BHC\u2019s\nnet income for the\nfour preceding\ncalendar quarters,\nunless otherwise\nspecified by the FRB;\nand (iii) make\nscheduled payments on\nadditional tier 1 and\ntier 2 capital\ninstruments. These\nprovisions may be\nextended by the FRB\nquarter-by-quarter.\n\nConcurrently with\nCCAR, federal banking\nregulators also\nrequire large BHCs and\nbanks to conduct their\nown stress tests to\nevaluate whether the\ninstitution has\nsufficient capital to\ncontinue to operate\nduring periods of\nadverse economic and\nfinancial conditions.\nThese stress testing\nrequirements set forth\nthe timing and type of\nstress test activities\nlarge BHCs and banks\nmust undertake as well\nas rules governing\nstress testing\ncontrols, oversight\nand disclosure\nrequirements. We\nsubmitted the results\nof our stress test to\nthe FRB and disclosed\na summary of the\nresults in June 2020.\n                                              \n  Securities Repurchases                      \n                                              \nFrom time to time the Board authorizes the\nCompany to repurchase shares of our common\nstock. Although we announce when the Board\nauthorizes share repurchases, we typically do\nnot give any public notice before we\nrepurchase our shares. Future stock\nrepurchases may be private or open-market\nrepurchases, including block transactions,\naccelerated or delayed block transactions,\nforward repurchase transactions, and similar\ntransactions. Additionally, we may enter into\nplans to purchase stock that satisfy the\nconditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934. Various factors\ndetermine the amount of our share repurchases,\nincluding our capital requirements, the number\nof shares we expect to issue for employee\nbenefit plans and acquisitions, market\nconditions (including the trading price of our\nstock), and regulatory and legal\nconsiderations, including the FRB\u2019s response\nto our capital plan and to changes in our risk\nprofile. Due to the various factors impacting\nthe amount of our share repurchases and the\nfact that we tend to be in the market\nregularly to satisfy repurchase considerations\nunder our capital plan, our share repurchases\noccur at various price levels. We may suspend\nshare repurchase activity at any time.\n\nOn September 30, 2020, the FRB announced that\nit was extending through fourth quarter 2020\nmeasures it announced on June 25, 2020,\nprohibiting large BHCs subject to the FRB\u2019s\ncapital plan rule, including Wells Fargo, from\nmaking capital distributions, subject to\ncertain limited exceptions that are described\nin the \u201cCapital Planning and Stress Testing\u201d\nsection above.\n\nAt September 30, 2020 , we had remaining Board\nauthority to repurchase approximately 167\nmillion shares, subject to regulatory and\nlegal conditions. For additional information\nabout share repurchases during third quarter\n2020, see Part II, Item 2 in this Report.\n\nHistorically, our policy has been to\nrepurchase shares under the \u201csafe harbor\u201d\nconditions of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 including a limitation on\nthe daily volume of repurchases. Rule 10b-18\nimposes an additional daily volume limitation\non share repurchases during a pending merger\nor acquisition in which shares of our stock\nwill constitute some or all of the\nconsideration. Our management may determine\nthat during a pending stock merger or\nacquisition when the safe harbor would\notherwise be available, it is in our best\ninterest to repurchase shares in excess of\nthis additional daily volume limitation. In\nsuch cases, we intend to repurchase shares in\ncompliance with the other conditions of the\nsafe harbor, including the standing daily\nvolume limitation that applies whether or not\nthere is a pending stock merger or\nacquisition.\n\n56\n                      \n  Regulatory Matters  \n                      \nSince the enactment of\nthe Dodd-Frank Act in\n2010, the U.S.\nfinancial services\nindustry has been\nsubject to a\nsignificant increase\nin regulation and\nregulatory oversight\ninitiatives. This\nincreased regulation\nand oversight has\nsubstantially changed\nhow most U.S.\nfinancial services\ncompanies conduct\nbusiness and has\nincreased their\nregulatory compliance\ncosts.\n\nFor a discussion of\ncertain consent orders\napplicable to the\nCompany, see the\n\u201cOverview\u201d section in\nthis Report. The\nfollowing supplements\nour discussion of the\nother significant\nregulations and\nregulatory oversight\ninitiatives that have\naffected or may affect\nour business contained\nin the \u201cRegulatory\nMatters\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d sections in\nour 2019 Form 10-K and\nin our 2020 First and\nSecond Quarter Reports\non Form 10-Q.\n\nREGULATORY\nDEVELOPMENTS RELATED\nTO COVID-19 In\nresponse to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and\nrelated events,\nfederal banking\nregulators have\nundertaken a number of\nmeasures to help\nstabilize the banking\nsector, support the\nbroader economy, and\nfacilitate the ability\nof banking\norganizations like\nWells Fargo to\ncontinue lending to\nconsumers and\nbusinesses. For\nexample, in order to\nfacilitate the\nCoronavirus Aid,\nRelief and Economic\nSecurity Act (CARES\nAct), federal banking\nregulators issued\nrules designed to\nencourage financial\ninstitutions to\nparticipate in\nstimulus measures,\nsuch as the Small\nBusiness\nAdministration\u2019s\nPaycheck Protection\nProgram and the FRB\u2019s\nMain Street Lending\nProgram. Similarly,\nthe FRB launched a\nnumber of lending\nfacilities designed to\nenhance liquidity and\nthe functioning of\nmarkets, including\nfacilities covering\nmoney market mutual\nfunds and term asset-\nbacked securities\nloans. Federal banking\nregulators also issued\nseveral rules amending\nthe regulatory capital\nand TLAC rules and\nother prudential\nregulations to ease\ncertain restrictions\non banking\norganizations and\nencourage the use of\ncertain FRB-\nestablished facilities\nin order to further\npromote lending to\nconsumers and\nbusinesses.\n\nIn addition, the OCC\nand the FRB issued\nguidelines for banks\nand BHCs related to\nworking with customers\naffected by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic,\nincluding guidance\nwith respect to\nwaiving fees, offering\nrepayment\naccommodations, and\nproviding payment\ndeferrals. Any current\nor future rules,\nregulations, and\nguidance related to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic\nand its impacts could\nrequire us to change\ncertain of our\nbusiness practices,\nreduce our revenue and\nearnings, impose\nadditional costs on\nus, or otherwise\nadversely affect our\nbusiness operations\nand/or competitive\nposition.\n                                            57\n                                \n  Critical Accounting Policies  \n                                \nOur significant\naccounting policies\n(see Note 1 (Summary\nof Significant\nAccounting Policies)\nto Financial\nStatements in our 2019\nForm 10-K) are\nfundamental to\nunderstanding our\nresults of operations\nand financial\ncondition because they\nrequire that we use\nestimates and\nassumptions that may\naffect the value of\nour assets or\nliabilities and\nfinancial results.\nFive of these policies\nare critical because\nthey require\nmanagement to make\ndifficult, subjective\nand complex judgments\nabout matters that are\ninherently uncertain\nand because it is\nlikely that materially\ndifferent amounts\nwould be reported\nunder different\nconditions or using\ndifferent assumptions.\nThese policies govern:\n\n\u2022 the allowance for\ncredit losses (ACL);\n\n\u2022 the valuation of\nresidential MSRs;\n\n\u2022 the fair value of\nfinancial instruments;\n\n\u2022 income taxes; and\n\n\u2022 liability for\ncontingent litigation\nlosses.\n\nManagement and the\nBoard\u2019s Audit\nCommittee have\nreviewed and approved\nthese critical\naccounting policies.\nThese policies are\ndescribed further in\nthe \u201cFinancial Review\n\u2013 Critical Accounting\nPolicies\u201d section and\nNote 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial\nStatements in our 2019\nForm 10-K. In\nconnection with our\nadoption of CECL on\nJanuary 1, 2020, we\nhave updated our\ncritical accounting\npolicy for the\nallowance for credit\nlosses.\n                                              \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                 \n                                              \nWe maintain an ACL for\nloans, which is\nmanagement\u2019s estimate\nof the expected credit\nlosses in the loan\nportfolio and unfunded\ncredit commitments, at\nthe balance sheet\ndate, excluding loans\nand unfunded credit\ncommitments carried at\nfair value or held for\nsale. Additionally, we\nmaintain an allowance\nfor credit losses for\ndebt securities\nclassified as either\nheld-to-maturity (HTM)\nor available-for-sale\n(AFS), other financial\nassets measured at\namortized cost, net\ninvestments in leases,\nand other off-balance\nsheet credit\nexposures. In\nconnection with our\nadoption of CECL, we\nupdated our approach\nfor estimating\nexpected credit\nlosses, which includes\nnew areas for\nmanagement judgment,\ndescribed more fully\nbelow, and updated our\naccounting policies.\nFor additional\ninformation, see Note\n1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial\nStatements in this\nReport.\n\nFor loans and HTM debt\nsecurities, the ACL is\nmeasured based on the\nremaining contractual\nterm of the financial\nasset (including off-\nbalance sheet credit\nexposures) adjusted,\nas appropriate, for\nprepayments and\npermitted extension\noptions using\nhistorical experience,\ncurrent conditions,\nand forecasted\ninformation. For AFS\ndebt securities, the\nACL is measured using\na discounted cash flow\napproach and is\nlimited to the\ndifference between the\nfair value of the\nsecurity and its\namortized cost.\n\nChanges in the ACL\nand, therefore, in the\nrelated provision for\ncredit losses can\nmaterially affect net\nincome. In applying\nthe judgment and\nreview required to\ndetermine the ACL,\nmanagement\nconsiderations include\nthe evaluation of past\nevents, historical\nexperience, changes in\neconomic forecasts and\nconditions, customer\nbehavior, collateral\nvalues, and the length\nof the initial loss\nforecast period, and\nother influences. From\ntime to time, changes\nin economic factors or\nassumptions, business\nstrategy, products or\nproduct mix, or debt\nsecurity investment\nstrategy, may result\nin a corresponding\nincrease or decrease\nin our ACL. While our\nmethodology attributes\nportions of the ACL to\nspecific financial\nasset classes (loan\nand debt security\nportfolios) or loan\nportfolio segments\n(commercial and\n\nconsumer), the entire\nACL is available to\nabsorb credit losses\nof the Company.\n\nJudgment is\nspecifically applied\nin:\n\n\u2022 Economic assumptions\nand the length of the\ninitial loss forecast\nperiod. Forecasted\neconomic variables,\nsuch as gross domestic\nproduct (GDP),\nunemployment rate or\ncollateral asset\nprices, are used to\nestimate expected\ncredit losses. While\nmany of these economic\nvariables are\nevaluated at the\nmacro-economy level,\nsome economic\nvariables may be\nforecasted at more\ngranular levels, for\nexample, using the\nmetro statistical area\n(MSA) level for\nunemployment rates,\nhome prices and\ncommercial real estate\nprices. Quarterly, we\nassess the length of\nthe initial loss\nforecast period and\nhave currently set the\nperiod to one year.\nManagement exercises\njudgment when\nassigning weight to\nthe three economic\nscenarios that are\nused to estimate\nfuture credit losses.\nThe three scenarios\ninclude a most likely\nexpectation of\neconomic variables\nreferred to as the\nbase case scenario, as\nwell as an optimistic\n(upside) scenario and\na pessimistic\n(downside) scenario.\n\n\u2022 Reversion of losses\nbeyond the initial\nforecast period. We\nuse a reversion\napproach to connect\nthe losses estimated\nfor our initial loss\nforecast period to the\nperiod of our\nhistorical loss\nforecast based on\neconomic conditions at\nthe measurement date.\nOur reversion\nmethodology considers\nthe type of portfolio,\npoint in the credit\ncycle, expected length\nof recessions and\nrecoveries, as well as\nother relevant\nfactors. The length of\nreversion period\nvaries by asset type \u2013\none year for shorter\ncontractual term loans\nsuch as commercial\nloans and two years\nfor longer contractual\nterm loans such as\nreal estate 1-4 family\nmortgage loans. We\nassess the reversion\napproach on a\nquarterly basis and\nthe length of the\nreversion period by\nasset type annually.\n\n\u2022 Historical loss\nexpectations . At the\nend of the reversion\nperiod, we incorporate\nthe changes in\neconomic variables\nobserved during\nrepresentative\nhistorical time\nperiods that include\nboth recessions and\nexpansions. This\nanalysis is used to\ncompute average losses\nfor any given\nportfolio and its\nassociated credit\ncharacteristics.\nAnnually, we assess\nthe historical time\nperiods and ensure the\naverage loss estimates\nare representative of\nour historical loss\nexperience.\n\n\u2022 Credit risk ratings\napplied to individual\ncommercial loans,\nunfunded credit\ncommitments, and debt\nsecurities.\nIndividually assessed\ncredit risk ratings\nare considered key\ncredit variables in\nour modeled approaches\nto help assess\nprobability of default\nand loss given\ndefault. Borrower\nquality ratings are\naligned to the\nborrower\u2019s financial\nstrength and\ncontribute to\nforecasted probability\nof default curves.\nCollateral quality\nratings combined with\nforecasted collateral\nprices (as applicable)\ncontribute to the\nforecasted severity of\nloss in the event of\ndefault. These credit\nrisk ratings are\nreviewed by\nexperienced senior\ncredit officers and\nsubjected to reviews\nby an internal team of\ncredit risk\nspecialists.\n\n\u2022 Usage of credit loss\nestimation models. We\nuse internally\ndeveloped models that\nincorporate credit\nattributes and\neconomic variables to\ngenerate estimates of\ncredit losses.\nManagement uses a\ncombination of\njudgement and\nquantitative analytics\nin the determination\nof segmentation,\nmodeling approach, and\nvariables that are\nleveraged in the\nmodels. These models\nare validated in\naccordance with the\nCompany\u2019s policies by\nan internal model\nvalidation group. We\nroutinely assess our\nmodel performance and\napply\n\n58\n\nadjustments when\nnecessary to improve\nthe accuracy of loss\nestimation. We also\nassess our models for\nlimitations against\nthe company-wide risk\ninventory to help\nensure that we\nappropriately capture\nknown and emerging\nrisks in our estimate\nof expected credit\nlosses and apply\noverlays as needed.\n\n\u2022 Valuation of\ncollateral . The\ncurrent fair value of\ncollateral is utilized\nto assess the expected\ncredit losses when a\nfinancial asset is\nconsidered to be\ncollateral dependent.\nWe apply judgment when\nvaluing the collateral\neither through\nappraisals, evaluation\nof the cash flows of\nthe property, or other\nquantitative\ntechniques. Decreases\nin collateral\nvaluations support\nincremental charge-\ndowns and increases in\ncollateral valuation\nare included in the\nallowance for credit\nlosses as a negative\nallowance when the\nfinancial asset has\nbeen previously\nwritten-down below\ncurrent recovery\nvalue.\n\n\u2022 Contractual term\nconsiderations. The\nremaining contractual\nterm of a loan is\nadjusted for expected\nprepayments and\ncertain expected\nextensions, renewals,\nor modifications. We\nextend the contractual\nterm when we are not\nable to\nunconditionally cancel\ncontractual renewals\nor extension options.\nWe also incorporate\ninto our allowance for\ncredit losses any\nscenarios where we\nreasonably expect to\nprovide an extension\nthrough a TDR.\n\n\u2022 Qualitative factors\nwhich may not be\nadequately captured in\nthe loss models. These\namounts represent\nmanagement\u2019s judgment\nof risks inherent in\nthe processes and\nassumptions used in\nestablishing the ACL.\nWe also consider\neconomic environmental\nfactors, modeling\nassumptions and\nperformance, process\nrisk, and other\nsubjective factors,\nincluding industry\ntrends and emerging\nrisk assessments.\n\nSensitivity The ACL\nfor loans is sensitive\nto changes in key\nassumptions which\nrequires significant\njudgment to be used by\nmanagement. Future\namounts of the ACL for\nloans will be based on\na variety of factors,\nincluding loan balance\nchanges, portfolio\ncredit quality, and\ngeneral economic\nconditions. General\neconomic conditions\nare forecasted using\neconomic variables,\nwhich could have\nvarying impacts on\ndifferent financial\nassets or portfolios.\nAdditionally,\nthroughout numerous\ncredit cycles, there\nare observed changes\nin economic variables\nsuch as the\nunemployment rate, GDP\nand real estate prices\nwhich may not move in\na correlated manner as\nvariables may move in\nopposite directions or\ndiffer across\nportfolios or\ngeography.\n\nOur sensitivity\nanalysis does not\nrepresent management\u2019s\nview of expected\ncredit losses at the\nbalance sheet date. We\napplied 50% weight to\nboth the base case\nscenario and the\ndownside scenario in\nour sensitivity\nanalysis to reflect\nthe potential for\nfurther economic\ndeterioration from a\nCOVID-19 resurgence.\nThe outcomes of both\nscenarios were\ninfluenced by the\nduration, severity,\nand timing of changes\nin economic variables\nwithin those\nscenarios. The\nsensitivity analysis\nresulted in a\nhypothetical increase\nin the ACL for loans\nof approximately $2.3\nbillion at September\n30, 2020. The\nhypothetical increase\nin our ACL for loans\ndoes not incorporate\nthe impact of\nmanagement judgment\nfor qualitative\nfactors applied in the\ncurrent ACL for loans,\nwhich may have a\npositive or negative\neffect on the results.\nIt is possible that\nothers performing\nsimilar sensitivity\nanalyses could reach\ndifferent conclusions\nor results.\n\nThe sensitivity\nanalysis excludes the\nACL for debt\nsecurities given its\nsize relative to the\noverall ACL.\nManagement believes\nthat the estimate for\nthe ACL for loans was\nappropriate at the\nbalance sheet date.\n                                            59\n                                   \n  Current Accounting Developments  \n                                   \nTable 40 provides the\nsignificant accounting\nupdates applicable to\nus that have been\nissued by the\nFinancial Accounting\nStandards Board (FASB)\nbut are not yet\neffective.\n\nTable 40: Current\nAccounting\nDevelopments \u2013 Issued\nStandards\n                                              \n                        Effective date and    \n  Description           financial statement   \n                        impact                \n  ASU 2018-12 \u2013                               \n  Financial Services                          \n  \u2013 Insurance (Topic                          \n  944):                                       \n  Targeted                                    \n  Improvements to                             \n  the Accounting for                          \n  Long-Duration                               \n  Contractsand                                \n  subsequent related                          \n  updates                                     \n                        The guidance becomes  \n                        effective on January  \n                        1, 2022.

The COVID-19\npandemic has\nnegatively impacted\nthe global economy,\ndisrupted global\nsupply chains,\naffected equity market\nvaluations, created\nsignificant volatility\nand disruption in\nfinancial markets, and\nincreased unemployment\nlevels. In addition,\nthe pandemic has\nresulted in\nrestrictions and\nclosures for many\nbusinesses, as well as\nthe institution of\nsocial distancing and\nsheltering in place\nrequirements in many\nstates and\ncommunities. As a\nresult, the demand for\nour products and\nservices may continue\nto be significantly\nimpacted, which could\nadversely affect our\nrevenue. Furthermore,\nthe pandemic could\ncontinue to result in\nthe recognition of\ncredit losses in our\nloan portfolios and\nincreases in our\nallowance for credit\nlosses, particularly\nif businesses remain\nclosed, the impact on\nthe global economy\nworsens, or more\ncustomers draw on\ntheir lines of credit\nor seek additional\nloans to help finance\ntheir businesses.\nSimilarly, because of\nchanging economic and\nmarket conditions\naffecting issuers, we\nmay be required to\nrecognize further\nimpairments on the\nsecurities we hold, as\nwell as reductions in\nother comprehensive\nincome. Moreover, the\npersistence of adverse\neconomic conditions\nand reduced revenue\nmay adversely affect\nthe fair value of our\noperating segments and\nunderlying reporting\nunits which may result\nin the impairment of\ngoodwill or other\nlong-lived assets. Our\nbusiness operations\nmay be further\ndisrupted if\nsignificant portions\nof our workforce are\nunable to work\neffectively, including\nbecause of illness,\nquarantines,\ngovernment actions, or\nother restrictions in\nconnection with the\npandemic, and we have\nalready temporarily\nclosed certain of our\nbranches and offices.\n\nMoreover, the pandemic\nhas created additional\noperational and\ncompliance risks,\nincluding the need to\nquickly implement and\nexecute new programs\nand procedures for the\nproducts and services\nwe offer our\ncustomers, provide\nenhanced safety\nmeasures for our\nemployees and\ncustomers, comply with\nrapidly changing\nregulatory\nrequirements, address\nany increased risk of\nfraudulent activity,\nand protect the\nintegrity and\nfunctionality of our\nsystems and networks\nas a larger number of\nour employees work\nremotely. The pandemic\ncould also result in\nor contribute to\nadditional downgrades\nto our credit ratings\nor credit outlook. In\nresponse to the\npandemic, we have\ntemporarily suspended\ncertain mortgage\nforeclosure\nactivities, and have\nprovided fee waivers,\npayment deferrals, and\nother expanded\nassistance for credit\ncard, automobile,\nmortgage, small\nbusiness, personal and\ncommercial lending\ncustomers, and future\ngovernmental actions\nmay require these and\nother types of\ncustomer-related\nresponses. In\naddition, we have\nreduced our common\nstock dividend and\ntemporarily suspended\nshare repurchases, and\nwe could take, or be\nrequired to take,\nother capital actions\nin the future. The\nextent to which the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nimpacts our business,\nresults of operations,\nand financial\ncondition, as well as\nour regulatory capital\nand liquidity ratios,\nwill depend on future\ndevelopments, which\nare highly uncertain\nand cannot be\npredicted, including\nthe scope and duration\nof the pandemic and\nactions taken by\ngovernmental\nauthorities and other\nthird parties in\nresponse to the\npandemic.\n                                            63\n                                              \n   Controls and Procedures                    \n                                              \n                                      \n  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  \n                                      \nThe Company\u2019s management evaluated the\neffectiveness, as of September 30, 2020, of\nthe Company\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures. The Company\u2019s chief executive\nofficer and chief financial officer\nparticipated in the evaluation. Based on this\nevaluation, the Company\u2019s chief executive\nofficer and chief financial officer concluded\nthat the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective as of September 30,\n2020.\n                                             \n  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  \n                                             \nInternal control over financial reporting is\ndefined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a\nprocess designed by, or under the supervision\nof, the Company\u2019s principal executive and\nprincipal financial officers and effected by\nthe Company\u2019s Board, management and other\npersonnel, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance\nwith U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (GAAP) and includes those policies\nand procedures that:\n\n\u2022 pertain to the maintenance of records that\nin reasonable detail accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of\nassets of the Company;\n\n\u2022 provide reasonable assurance that\ntransactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with GAAP, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the Company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of\nmanagement and directors of the Company; and\n\n\u2022 provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use or disposition of the\nCompany\u2019s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls\nmay become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate. No change occurred during third\nquarter 2020 that has materially affected, or\nis reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting.\n\n64\n                                              \n                                           \u2026  \n                      \u2026                    \u2026  \n                      \u2026                    \u2026  \n                      \u2026                    \u2026  \n                      \u2026                    \u2026  \n             \u2026        \u2026           \u2026        \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n      $  2\u2026       3\u2026       $  8\u2026       1\u2026     \n         2\u2026       2\u2026          6\u2026       5\u2026     \n          7       20          26       64     \n         7\u2026       1\u2026          2\u2026       3\u2026     \n         1\u2026       2\u2026          4\u2026       6\u2026     \n         60       1\u2026          8\u2026       4\u2026     \n         1\u2026       1\u2026          3\u2026       5\u2026     \n                                              \n         3\u2026       2\u2026          2\u2026       6\u2026     \n         -\u2026       6\u2026          2\u2026       1\u2026     \n         1\u2026       1\u2026          3\u2026       5\u2026     \n         92       1\u2026          3\u2026       4\u2026     \n         1\u2026       4\u2026          6\u2026       1\u2026     \n         9\u2026       1\u2026          3\u2026       3\u2026     \n                                              \n         18        \u2014          1\u2026        \u2014     \n         7\u2026       6\u2026          1\u2026       2\u2026     \n         8\u2026       1\u2026          1\u2026       3\u2026     \n                                              \n         1\u2026       1\u2026          3\u2026       4\u2026     \n         3\u2026       3\u2026          1\u2026       1\u2026     \n         9\u2026       1\u2026          2\u2026       2\u2026     \n         3\u2026       3\u2026          1\u2026       1\u2026     \n         1\u2026       4\u2026          2\u2026       1\u2026     \n         3\u2026       2\u2026          1\u2026       8\u2026     \n         2\u2026        3          7\u2026       1\u2026     \n         6\u2026       9\u2026          -\u2026       2\u2026     \n         3\u2026       4\u2026          1\u2026       1\u2026     \n         2\u2026       1\u2026          8\u2026       3\u2026     \n         9\u2026       1\u2026          2\u2026       2\u2026     \n                                              \n         8\u2026       8\u2026          2\u2026       2\u2026     \n         7\u2026       8\u2026          2\u2026       2\u2026     \n         8\u2026       7\u2026          2\u2026       2\u2026     \n         1\u2026       1\u2026          2\u2026       2\u2026     \n         1\u2026       1\u2026          5\u2026       4\u2026     \n         2\u2026       2\u2026          7\u2026       8\u2026     \n         1\u2026       2\u2026          4\u2026       8\u2026     \n         7\u2026        \u2014          7\u2026        \u2014     \n         8\u2026       8\u2026          2\u2026       2\u2026     \n         1\u2026       1\u2026          4\u2026       4\u2026     \n         2\u2026       6\u2026          -\u2026       2\u2026     \n         6\u2026       1\u2026          -\u2026       3\u2026     \n         2\u2026       4\u2026          3\u2026       1\u2026     \n         1\u2026       2\u2026          83       4\u2026     \n      $  2\u2026       4\u2026       $  3\u2026       1\u2026     \n         3\u2026       5\u2026          1\u2026       1\u2026     \n      $  1\u2026       4\u2026       $  -\u2026       1\u2026     \n                                              \n      $  0\u2026       0\u2026       $  -\u2026       3\u2026     \n         0\u2026       0\u2026          -\u2026       3\u2026     \n         4\u2026       4\u2026          4\u2026       4\u2026     \n         4\u2026       4\u2026          4\u2026       4\u2026     \n                                              \n(1) Prior to our adoption of Accounting\nStandards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial\nInstruments \u2013 Credit Losses (Topic 326):\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments (CECL) , on January 1, 2020,\nprovision for credit losses from debt\nsecurities was not applicable and is therefore\npresented as $ 0for both the third quarter and\nfirst nine months of 2019.

We provide\nbanking, trust and investments, mortgage\nbanking, investment banking, retail banking,\nbrokerage, and consumer and commercial finance\nthrough banking locations, the internet and\nother distribution channels to consumers,\nbusinesses and institutions in all 50 states,\nthe District of Columbia, and in foreign\ncountries. When we refer to \u201cWells Fargo,\u201d\n\u201cthe Company,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus,\u201d we mean\nWells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries\n(consolidated). Wells Fargo & Company (the\nParent) is a financial holding company and a\nbank holding company. We also hold a majority\ninterest in a real estate investment trust,\nwhich has publicly traded preferred stock\noutstanding. Our accounting and reporting\npolicies conform with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP) and practices in\nthe financial services industry. For\ndiscussion of our significant accounting\npolicies, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019\n(2019 Form 10-K). To prepare the financial\nstatements in conformity with GAAP, management\nmust make estimates based on assumptions about\nfuture economic and market conditions (for\nexample, unemployment, market liquidity, real\nestate prices, etc.) that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities at the date\nof the financial statements, income and\nexpenses during the reporting period and the\nrelated disclosures. Although our estimates\ncontemplate current conditions and how we\nexpect them to change in the future, it is\nreasonably possible that actual conditions\ncould be worse than anticipated in those\nestimates, which could materially affect our\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nManagement has made significant estimates in\nseveral areas, including: \u2022 allowance for\ncredit losses (Note 6 (Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit Losses); \u2022 valuations of\nresidential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)\n(Note 10 (Securitizations and Variable\nInterest Entities) and Note 11 (Mortgage\nBanking Activities)); \u2022 valuations of\nfinancial instruments (Note 15 (Derivatives)\nand Note 16 (Fair Values of Assets and\nLiabilities)); \u2022 liabilities for contingent\nlitigation losses (Note 14 (Legal Actions));\nand \u2022 income taxes. Actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates. These unaudited\ninterim financial statements reflect all\nadjustments that are, in the opinion of\nmanagement, necessary for a fair statement of\nthe results for the periods presented. These\nadjustments are of a normal recurring nature,\nunless otherwise disclosed in this Form 10-Q.\nThe results of operations in the interim\nfinancial statements do not necessarily\nindicate the results that may be expected for\nthe full year. The interim financial\ninformation should be read in conjunction with\nour 2019 Form 10-K. Accounting Standards\nAdopted in 2020 In 2020, we adopted the\nfollowing new accounting guidance: \u2022\nAccounting Standards Update (ASU or Update)\n2020-04 \u2013 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848):\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate\nReform on Financial Reporting \u2022 ASU 2019-04 \u2013\nCodification Improvements to Topic 326,\nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses , Topic\n815, Derivatives and Hedging , and Topic 825,\nFinancial Instruments . This Update includes\nguidance on recoveries of financial assets,\nwhich is included in the discussion for ASU\n2016-13 below. \u2022 ASU 2018-17 \u2013 Consolidation\n(Topic 810): Targeted Improvements to Related\nParty Guidance for Variable Interest Entities\n\u2022 ASU 2018-15 \u2013 Intangibles \u2013 Goodwill and\nOther \u2013 Internal-Use Software (Subtopic\n350-40): Customer\u2019s Accounting for\nImplementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud\nComputing Arrangement That Is a Service\nContract (a consensus of the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging\nIssues Task Force) \u2022 ASU 2018-13 \u2013 Fair Value\nMeasurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework\n\u2013 Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for\nFair Value Measurement. \u2022 ASU 2017-04 \u2013\nIntangibles \u2013 Goodwill and Other (Topic 350):\nSimplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment \u2022\nASU 2016-13 \u2013 Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit\nLosses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments and related\nsubsequent Updates ASU 2020-04 provides\noptional, temporary relief to ease the burden\nof accounting for reference rate reform\nactivities that affect contractual\nmodifications of floating rate financial\ninstruments indexed to interbank offering\nrates (IBORs) and hedge accounting\nrelationships. Modifications of qualifying\ncontracts are accounted for as the\ncontinuation of an existing contract rather\nthan as a new contract. Modifications of\nqualifying hedging relationships will not\nrequire discontinuation of the existing hedge\naccounting relationships. The application of\nthe relief for qualifying existing hedging\nrelationships may be made on a hedge-by-hedge\nbasis and across multiple reporting periods.\nWe adopted ASU 2020-04 on April 1, 2020, and\nthe guidance will be followed until the Update\nterminates on December 31, 2022. This guidance\nis applied on a prospective basis. The Update\ndid not have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. ASU 2018-17\nupdates the guidance used by decision-makers\nof VIEs. Indirect interests held through\nrelated parties in common control arrangements\nwill be considered on a proportional basis for\ndetermining whether fees paid to decision-\nmakers and service providers are variable\ninterests. This is consistent with how\nindirect interests held through related\nparties under common control are considered\nfor determining whether a reporting entity\nmust consolidate a VIE. The Update did not\nhave a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial statements. ASU 2018-15 clarifies\nthe accounting for implementation costs\nrelated to a cloud computing arrangement that\nis a service contract and enhances disclosures\naround implementation costs for internal-use\nsoftware and cloud computing arrangements. The\nguidance aligns the requirements for\ncapitalizing implementation costs incurred in\na hosting arrangement that is a service\ncontract with the requirements for\ncapitalizing implementation costs incurred to\ndevelop or obtain internal-use software (and\nhosting arrangements that include an internal-\nuse\n                                            73\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies ( continued )\n\nsoftware license). It also requires the\nexpense related to the capitalized\nimplementation costs be presented in the same\nline item in the statement of income as the\nfees associated with the hosting element of\nthe arrangement and capitalized implementation\ncosts be presented in the balance sheet in the\nsame line item that a prepayment for the fees\nof the associated hosting arrangement are\npresented. The Update did not have a material\nimpact on our consolidated financial\nstatements. ASU 2018-13 clarifies, eliminates\nand adds certain fair value measurement\ndisclosure requirements for assets and\nliabilities, which affects our disclosures in\nNote 16 (Fair Values of Assets and\nLiabilities). Although the ASU became\neffective on January 1, 2020, it permitted\nearly adoption of individual requirements\nwithout causing others to be early adopted\nand, as such, we partially adopted the Update\nduring third quarter 2018 and the remainder of\nthe requirements in first quarter 2020. The\nUpdate did not have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. ASU 2017-04\nsimplifies the goodwill impairment test by\neliminating the requirement to assign the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit to all of the assets\nand liabilities of that unit (including any\nunrecognized intangible assets) as if the\nreporting unit had been acquired in a business\ncombination. The Update requires that a\ngoodwill impairment loss is recognized if the\nfair value of the reporting unit is less than\nthe carrying amount, including goodwill. The\ngoodwill impairment loss is limited to the\namount of goodwill allocated to the reporting\nunit. The guidance did not change the\nqualitative assessment of goodwill. This\nguidance is applied on a prospective basis,\nand accordingly, the Update did not have a\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements. ASU 2016-13 changes the accounting\nfor the measurement of credit losses on loans\nand debt securities. For loans and held-to-\nmaturity (HTM) debt securities, the Update\nrequires a current expected credit loss (CECL)\nmeasurement to estimate the allowance for\ncredit losses (ACL) for the remaining\ncontractual term, adjusted for prepayments, of\nthe financial asset (including off-balance\nsheet credit exposures) using historical\nexperience, current conditions, and reasonable\nand supportable forecasts. Also, the Update\neliminates the existing guidance for purchased\ncredit-impaired (PCI) loans, but requires an\nallowance for purchased financial assets with\nmore than an insignificant deterioration of\ncredit since origination. In addition, the\nUpdate modifies the other-than-temporary\nimpairment (OTTI) model for available-for-sale\n(AFS) debt securities to require an allowance\nfor credit impairment instead of a direct\nwrite-down, which allows for reversal of\ncredit impairments in future periods based on\nimprovements in credit. Upon adoption, we\nrecognized an overall decrease in our ACL of\napproximately $ 1.3billion (pre-tax) as a\ncumulative effect adjustment from a change in\naccounting policies, which increased our\nretained earnings and regulatory capital\namounts and ratios. Loans previously\nclassified as PCI were automatically\ntransitioned to purchased credit-deteriorated\n(PCD) classification. We recognized an ACL for\nthese new PCD loans and made a corresponding\nadjustment to the loan balance, with no impact\nto net income or transition adjustment to\nretained earnings.

Our accounting policy for the\nACL was updated and is now inclusive of loans,\ndebt securities and other financing\nreceivables. Other than the ACL and the\nelimination of PCI loans, there were no\nchanges to accounting policies for loans as\ndescribed in the 2019 Form 10-K. For debt\nsecurities, other than the policies with\nrespect to the ACL, all of the current\naccounting policies, including those that\nchanged as a result of CECL adoption, are\nincluded below under Debt Securities. Debt\nSecurities Our investments in debt securities\nthat are not held for trading purposes are\nclassified as either debt securities\navailable-for-sale (AFS) or held-to-maturity\n(HTM). Investments in debt securities for\nwhich the Company does not have the positive\nintent and ability to hold to maturity are\nclassified as AFS. AFS debt securities are\nmeasured at fair value, with unrealized gains\nand losses reported in cumulative other\ncomprehensive income (OCI), net of the\nallowance for credit losses and applicable\nincome taxes. Investments in debt securities\n\n74\n\nfor which the Company has the positive intent\nand ability to hold to maturity are classified\nas HTM. HTM debt securities are measured at\namortized cost, net of allowance for credit\nlosses. INTEREST INCOME AND GAIN/LOSS\nRECOGNITION Unamortized premiums and discounts\nare recognized in interest income over the\ncontractual life of the security using the\neffective interest method, except for\npurchased callable debt securities carried at\na premium. For purchased callable debt\nsecurities carried at a premium, the premium\nis amortized into interest income to the\nearliest call date using the effective\ninterest method. As principal repayments are\nreceived on securities (e.g., mortgage-backed\nsecurities (MBS)), a proportionate amount of\nthe related premium or discount is recognized\nin income so that the effective interest rate\non the remaining portion of the security\ncontinues unchanged. We recognize realized\ngains and losses on the sale of debt\nsecurities in net gains (losses) on debt\nsecurities within noninterest income using the\nspecific identification method. IMPAIRMENT AND\nCREDIT LOSSES Unrealized losses of AFS debt\nsecurities are driven by a number of factors,\nincluding changes in interest rates and credit\nspreads which impact most types of debt\nsecurities with additional considerations for\ncertain types of debt securities: \u2022 Debt\nsecurities of U.S. Treasury and federal\nagencies, including federal agency MBS, are\nnot impacted by credit movements given the\nexplicit or implicit guarantees provided by\nthe U.S. government. \u2022 Debt securities of U.S.\nstates and political subdivisions are most\nimpacted by changes in the relationship\nbetween municipal and term funding credit\ncurves rather than by changes in the credit\nquality of the underlying securities. \u2022\nStructured securities, such as MBS and\ncollateralized loan obligations (CLO), are\nalso impacted by changes in projected\ncollateral losses of assets underlying the\nsecurity. For debt securities where fair value\nis less than amortized cost basis, we\nrecognize impairment in earnings if we have\nthe intent to sell the security or if it is\nmore likely than not that we will be required\nto sell the security before recovery of its\namortized cost basis. Impairment is recognized\nequal to the entire difference between the\namortized cost basis and the fair value of the\nsecurity and is classified as net gains\n(losses) from debt securities within\nnoninterest income. Following the recognition\nof impairment, the security\u2019s new amortized\ncost basis is the previous basis less\nimpairment. For debt securities where fair\nvalue is less than amortized cost basis where\nwe did not recognize impairment in earnings,\nwe set up an allowance for credit losses as of\nthe balance sheet date. See \u201cAllowance for\nCredit Losses\u201d section in this Note. TRANSFERS\nBETWEEN CATEGORIES OF DEBT SECURITIES AFS debt\nsecurities transferred to the HTM\nclassification are recorded at fair value and\nthe unrealized gains or losses resulting from\nthe transfer of these securities continue to\nbe reported in cumulative OCI. The cumulative\nOCI balance is amortized into earnings over\nthe same period as the unamortized premiums\nand discounts using the effective interest\nmethod. Any allowance for credit losses\npreviously recorded under the AFS model on\nsecurities transferred to HTM is reversed and\nan allowance for credit losses is subsequently\nrecorded under the HTM debt security model.\nNONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE, AND CHARGE-OFF\nPOLICIES We generally place debt securities on\nnonaccrual status using factors similar to\nthose described for loans. When we place a\ndebt security on nonaccrual status, we reverse\nthe accrued unpaid interest receivable against\ninterest income and suspend the amortization\nof premiums and accretion of discounts. If the\nultimate collectability of the principal is in\ndoubt on a nonaccrual debt security, any cash\ncollected is first applied to reduce the\nsecurity\u2019s amortized cost basis to zero,\nfollowed by recovery of amounts previously\ncharged off, and subsequently to interest\nincome. Generally, we return a debt security\nto accrual status when all delinquent interest\nand principal become current under the\ncontractual terms of the security and\ncollectability of remaining principal and\ninterest is no longer doubtful. Our debt\nsecurities are considered past due when\ncontractually required principal or interest\npayments have not been made on the due dates.\nOur charge-off policy for debt securities are\nsimilar to those described for loans.\nSubsequent to charge-off, the debt security\nwill be designated as nonaccrual and follow\nthe process described above for any cash\nreceived. Allowance for Credit Losses The ACL\nis management\u2019s estimate of the current\nexpected credit losses in the loan portfolio\nand unfunded credit commitments, at the\nbalance sheet date, excluding loans and\nunfunded credit commitments carried at fair\nvalue or held for sale. Additionally, we\nmaintain an ACL on AFS and HTM debt\nsecurities, other financing receivables\nmeasured at amortized cost, and other off-\nbalance sheet credit exposures. While we\nattribute portions of the allowance to\nspecific financial asset classes (loan and\ndebt security portfolios), loan portfolio\nsegments (commercial and consumer) or major\nsecurity type, the entire ACL is available to\nabsorb credit losses of the Company. Our ACL\nprocess involves procedures to appropriately\nconsider the unique risk characteristics of\nour financial asset classes, portfolio\nsegments, and major security types. For each\nloan portfolio segment and each major HTM debt\nsecurity type, losses are estimated\ncollectively for groups of loans or securities\nwith similar risk characteristics. For loans\nand securities that do not share similar risk\ncharacteristics with other financial assets,\nthe losses are estimated individually, which\nprimarily includes our impaired large\ncommercial loans and non-accruing HTM debt\nsecurities. For AFS debt securities, losses\nare estimated at the tax-lot level. Our ACL\namounts are influenced by a variety of\nfactors, including changes in loan and debt\nsecurity volumes, portfolio credit quality,\nand general economic conditions. General\neconomic conditions are forecasted using\neconomic variables which will create\nvolatility as those variables change over\ntime. See Table 1.2 for key economic variables\nused for our loan portfolios.\n                                            75\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies ( continued )\n\nTable 1.2: Key Economic Variables\n                                              \n  Loan Portfolio        Key economic          \n                        variables             \n                        \u2022      Gross          \n                        domestic product      \n                        \u2022      Commercial     \n                        real estate asset     \n                        prices, where         \n  Total commercial      applicable            \n                        \u2022      Unemployment   \n                        rate                  \n                        \u2022      Corporate      \n                        investment-grade      \n                        bond spreads          \n                        \u2022      Home price     \n  Real estate 1-4       index                 \n  family mortgage       \u2022      Unemployment   \n                        rate                  \n  Other consumer                              \n  (including credit                           \n  card,                 \u2022      Unemployment   \n  automobile, and       rate                  \n  other revolving                             \n  credit                                      \n  and installment)                            \n                                              \nOur approach for estimating expected life-time\ncredit losses for loans and debt securities\nincludes the following key components: \u2022 An\ninitial loss forecast period of one year for\nall portfolio segments and classes of\nfinancing receivables and off-balance-sheet\ncredit exposures. This period reflects\nmanagement\u2019s expectation of losses based on\nforward-looking economic scenarios over that\ntime. \u2022 A historical loss forecast period\ncovering the remaining contractual term,\nadjusted for expected prepayments and certain\nexpected extensions, renewals, or\nmodifications, by portfolio segment and class\nof financing receivables based on the changes\nin key historical economic variables during\nrepresentative historical expansionary and\nrecessionary periods. \u2022 A reversion period of\nup to two years to connect the losses\nestimated for our initial loss forecast period\nto the period of our historical loss forecast\nbased on economic conditions at the\nmeasurement date. Our reversion methodology\nconsiders the type of portfolio, point in the\ncredit cycle, expected length of recessions\nand recoveries, as well as other relevant\nfactors. \u2022 Utilization of discounted cash flow\n(DCF) methods to measure credit impairment for\nloans modified in a troubled debt\nrestructuring, unless they are collateral\ndependent and measured at the fair value of\nthe collateral. The DCF methods obtain\nestimated life-time credit losses using the\ninitial and historical mean loss forecast\nperiods described above. \u2022 For AFS debt\nsecurities and certain beneficial interests\nclassified as HTM, we utilize the DCF methods\nto measure the ACL, which incorporate expected\ncredit losses using the conceptual components\ndescribed above. The ACL on AFS debt\nsecurities is subject to a limitation based on\nthe fair value of the debt securities (fair\nvalue floor). The ACL for financial assets\nheld at amortized cost and AFS debt securities\nwill be reversible with immediate recognition\nof recovery in earnings if credit improves.\nThe ACL for financial assets held at amortized\ncost is a valuation account that is deducted\nfrom, or added to, the amortized cost basis of\nthe financial assets to present the net amount\nexpected to be collected, which can include a\nnegative allowance limited to the cumulative\namounts previously charged off. For financial\nassets with an ACL estimated using DCF\nmethods, changes in the ACL due to the passage\nof time are recorded in interest income. The\nACL for AFS debt securities reflects the\namount of unrealized loss related to expected\ncredit losses, limited by the amount that fair\nvalue is less than the amortized cost basis,\nand cannot have an associated negative\nallowance. For certain financial assets, such\nas residential real estate loans guaranteed by\nthe Government National Mortgage Association\n(GNMA), an agency of the federal government,\nU. S. Treasury and Agency mortgage backed debt\nsecurities, as well as certain sovereign debt\nsecurities, the Company has not recognized an\nACL as our expectation of nonpayment of the\namortized cost basis, based on historical\nlosses, adjusted for current conditions and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts, is zero.\nA financial asset is collateral-dependent when\nthe borrower is experiencing financial\ndifficulty and repayment is expected to be\nprovided substantially through the sale or\noperation of the collateral. When a\ncollateral-dependent financial asset is\nprobable of foreclosure, we will measure the\nACL based on the fair value of the collateral.\nIf we intend to sell the underlying\ncollateral, we will measure the ACL based on\nthe collateral\u2019s net realizable value (fair\nvalue of collateral, less estimated costs to\nsell). In most situations, based on our\ncharge-off policies, we will immediately\nwrite-down the financial asset to the fair\nvalue of the collateral or net realizable\nvalue. For consumer loans, collateral-\ndependent financial assets may have collateral\nin the form of residential real estate,\nautomobiles or other personal assets. For\ncommercial loans, collateral-dependent\nfinancial assets may have collateral in the\nform of commercial real estate or other\nbusiness assets. We do not generally record an\nACL for accrued interest receivables because\nuncollectible accrued interest is reversed\nthrough interest income in a timely manner in\nline with our non-accrual and past due\npolicies for loans and debt securities. For\nconsumer credit card and certain consumer\nlines of credit, we include an ACL for accrued\ninterest and fees since these loans are not\nplaced on nonaccrual status and written off\nuntil the loan is 180 days past due. Accrued\ninterest receivables are included in other\nassets, except for certain revolving loans,\nsuch as credit card loans. COMMERCIAL LOAN\nPORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY Generally,\ncommercial loans, which include net\ninvestments in lease financing, are assessed\nfor estimated losses by grading each loan\nusing various risk factors as identified\nthrough periodic reviews. Our estimation\napproach for the commercial portfolio reflects\nthe estimated probability of default in\naccordance with the borrower\u2019s financial\nstrength and the severity of loss in the event\nof default, considering the quality of any\nunderlying collateral. Probability of default\nand severity at the time of default are\nstatistically derived through historical\nobservations of default and losses after\ndefault within each credit risk rating. These\nestimates are adjusted as appropriate based on\nadditional analysis of long-term average loss\nexperience compared with previously forecasted\nlosses, external loss data or other risks\nidentified from current economic conditions\nand credit quality trends. The estimated\nprobability of default and severity at the\ntime of default are applied to loan equivalent\nexposures to estimate losses for unfunded\ncredit commitments. CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO\nSEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY For consumer loans, we\ndetermine the allowance at the individual loan\nlevel. When developing historical loss\nexperience, we pool loans, generally by\nproduct types with similar risk\ncharacteristics, such as residential real\nestate mortgages and credit cards. As\nappropriate and to achieve greater accuracy,\nwe may further stratify selected portfolios by\nsub-product, origination channel,\n\n76\n\nvintage, loss type, geographic location and\nother predictive characteristics. We use\npooled loan data such as historic delinquency\nand default and loss severity in the\ndevelopment of our consumer loan models, in\naddition to home price trends, unemployment\ntrends, and other economic variables that may\ninfluence the frequency and severity of losses\nin the consumer portfolio. AFS PORTFOLIO ACL\nMETHODOLOGY We develop our ACL estimate for\nAFS debt securities by utilizing a security-\nlevel multi-scenario, probability-weighted\ndiscounted cash flow model based on a\ncombination of past events, current\nconditions, as well as reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. The projected cash\nflows are discounted at the security\u2019s\neffective interest rate, except for certain\nvariable rate securities which are discounted\nusing projections of future changes in\ninterest rates, prepayable securities which\nare adjusted for estimated prepayments, and\nsecurities part of a fair value hedge which\nuse hedge-adjusted assumptions. The ACL on an\nAFS debt security is limited to the difference\nbetween its amortized cost basis and fair\nvalue (fair value floor) and reversals of the\nallowance are permitted up to the amount\npreviously recorded. HTM PORTFOLIO ACL\nMETHODOLOGY For most HTM debt securities, the\nACL is measured using an expected loss model,\nsimilar to the methodology used for loans.\nUnlike AFS debt securities, the ACL on an HTM\ndebt security is not limited to the fair value\nfloor. Certain beneficial interests\ncategorized as HTM debt securities utilize a\nsimilar discounted cash flow model as\ndescribed for AFS debt securities, without the\nlimitation of the fair value floor. OTHER\nQUALITATIVE FACTORS The ACL includes amounts\nfor qualitative factors which may not be\nadequately reflected in our loss models. These\namounts represent management\u2019s judgment of\nrisks in the processes and assumptions used in\nestablishing the ACL. Generally, these amounts\nare established at a granular level below our\nloan portfolio segments. We also consider\neconomic environmental factors, modeling\nassumptions and performance, process risk, and\nother subjective factors, including industry\ntrends and emerging risk assessments. OFF-\nBALANCE SHEET CREDIT EXPOSURES Our off-balance\nsheet credit exposures include unfunded loan\ncommitments (generally in the form of\nrevolving lines of credit), financial\nguarantees not accounted for as insurance\ncontracts or derivatives, including standby\nletters of credit, and other similar\ninstruments. For off-balance sheet credit\nexposures, we recognize an ACL associated with\nthe unfunded amounts. We do not recognize an\nACL for commitments that are unconditionally\ncancelable at our discretion. Additionally, we\nrecognize an ACL for financial guarantees that\ncreate off-balance sheet credit exposure, such\nas loans sold with credit recourse and\nfactoring guarantees. ACL for off-balance\nsheet credit exposures are reported as a\nliability in accrued expenses and other\nliabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nOTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS Other financial assets\nare evaluated for expected credit losses.\nThese other financial assets include accounts\nreceivable for fees, receivables from\ngovernment-sponsored entities, such as Federal\nNational Mortgage Association (FNMA) and\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation\n(FHLMC), and GNMA, and other accounts\nreceivable from high-credit quality\ncounterparties, such as central clearing\ncounterparties. Many of these financial assets\nare generally not expected to have an ACL as\nthere is a zero loss expectation (for example,\ngovernment guarantee) or no historical credit\nlosses. Some financial assets, such as loans\nto employees, maintain an ACL that is\npresented on a net basis with the related\namortized cost amounts in other assets on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. Given the nature\nof these financial assets, provision for\ncredit losses is not recognized separately\nfrom the regular income or expense associated\nwith these financial assets. Securities\npurchased under resale agreements are\ngenerally over-collateralized by securities or\ncash and are generally short-term in nature.\nWe have elected the practical expedient for\nthese financial assets given collateral\nmaintenance provisions. These provisions\nrequire that we monitor the collateral value\nand customers are required to replenish\ncollateral, if needed. Accordingly, we\ngenerally do not maintain an ACL for these\nfinancial assets. PURCHASED CREDIT\nDETERIORATED FINANCIAL ASSETS Financial assets\nacquired that are of poor credit quality and\nwith more than an insignificant evidence of\ncredit deterioration since their origination\nor issuance are PCD assets. PCD assets are\nrecorded at their purchase price plus an ACL\nestimated at the time of acquisition. Under\nthis approach, there is no provision for\ncredit losses recognized at acquisition;\nrather, there is a gross-up of the purchase\nprice of the financial asset for the estimate\nof expected credit losses and a corresponding\nACL recorded. Changes in estimates of expected\ncredit losses after acquisition are recognized\nas provision for credit losses (or reversal of\nprovision for credit losses) in subsequent\nperiods. In general, interest income\nrecognition for PCD financial assets is\nconsistent with interest income recognition\nfor the similar non-PCD financial asset.\nTroubled Debt Restructuring and Other Relief\nRelated to COVID-19 On March 25, 2020, the\nU.S. Senate approved the Coronavirus, Aid,\nRelief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES\nAct) providing optional, temporary relief from\naccounting for certain loan modifications as\ntroubled debt restructurings (TDRs). Under the\nCARES Act, TDR relief is available to banks\nfor loan modifications related to the adverse\neffects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\n(COVID-related modifications) granted to\nborrowers that are current as of December 31,\n2019. TDR relief applies to COVID-related\nmodifications made from March 1, 2020, until\nthe earlier of December 31, 2020, or 60 days\nfollowing the termination of the national\nemergency declared by the President of the\nUnited States. In first quarter 2020, we\nelected to apply the TDR relief provided by\nthe CARES Act. On April 7, 2020, federal\nbanking regulators issued the Interagency\nStatement on Loan Modifications and Reporting\nfor Financial Institutions Working with\nCustomers Affected by the Coronavirus\n(Revised) (the Interagency Statement). The\nguidance in the Interagency Statement provides\nadditional TDR relief as it clarifies that it\nis not necessary to consider the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on the financial condition\nof a borrower in connection with a short-term\n(e.g., six months or less) COVID-related\nmodification provided the borrower is current\nat the date the modification program is\nimplemented. For COVID-related modifications\nin the form of payment deferrals, delinquency\nstatus will not advance and loans that were\naccruing at the time the relief is provided\nwill generally not be placed on nonaccrual\nstatus during the deferral period. COVID-\nrelated modifications that do not meet the\nprovisions of the\n                                            77\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies ( continued )\n\nCARES Act or the Interagency Statement will be\nassessed for TDR classification. On April 10,\n2020, the FASB Staff issued Accounting for\nLease Concessions Related to the Effects of\nthe COVID-19 Pandemic , a question and answer\nguide (the guide).

For\nadditional information\nsee Note 3 ( Cash,\nLoan and Dividend\nRestrictions) in our\n2019 Form 10-K.\nThe FRB\u2019s Capital Plan Rule (codified at 12\nCFR 225.8 of Regulation Y) establishes capital\nplanning and other requirements that govern\ncapital distributions including dividends by\ncertain large bank holding companies. The FRB\nhas also published guidance regarding its\nsupervisory expectations for capital planning,\nincluding capital policies regarding the\nprocess relating to common stock dividend and\nrepurchase decisions in the FRB\u2019s SR Letter\n15-18. The Parent\u2019s ability to make certain\ncapital distributions is subject to review by\nthe FRB as part of the Parent\u2019s capital plan\nin connection with the FRB\u2019s annual\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(CCAR). The Parent\u2019s ability to take certain\ncapital actions is also subject to the Parent\nmeeting or exceeding certain regulatory\ncapital minimums. On September 30, 2020, the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (FRB) announced that it was extending\nthrough fourth quarter 2020 measures it\nannounced on June 25, 2020, prohibiting large\nbank holding companies (BHCs) subject to the\nFRB\u2019s capital plan rule, including Wells\nFargo, from making any capital distribution\n(excluding any capital distribution arising\nfrom the issuance of a capital instrument\neligible for inclusion in the numerator of a\nregulatory capital ratio), unless otherwise\napproved by the FRB. The FRB has generally\nauthorized BHCs to (i) make share repurchases\nrelating to issuances of common stock related\nto employee stock ownership plans; (ii)\nprovided that the BHC does not increase the\namount of its common stock dividends, pay\ncommon stock dividends that do not exceed an\namount equal to the average of the BHC\u2019s net\nincome for the four preceding calendar\nquarters, unless otherwise specified by the\nFRB; and (iii) make scheduled payments on\nadditional tier 1 and tier 2 capital\ninstruments. These provisions may be extended\nby the FRB quarter-by-quarter.\n                                            79\n                             \n  Note 4:Trading Activities  \n                             \nTable 4.1 presents a summary of our trading\nassets and liabilities measured at fair value\nthrough earnings.\nTable 4.1: Trading Assets and Liabilities\n                                              \n                     Sep              Dec     \n  (in                30,              31,     \n  mill\u2026              2020             2019    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Trad\u2026                                       \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Debt     $  73,2\u2026            79,7\u2026          \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Equi\u2026       14,0\u2026            27,4\u2026          \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Loans                                       \n  held        1,688              972          \n  for                                         \n  sale                                        \n  Gross                                       \n  trad\u2026       57,9\u2026            34,8\u2026          \n  deri\u2026                                       \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Nett\u2026       -35,\u2026            -21,\u2026          \n  (1)                                         \n  Total                                       \n  trad\u2026       22,3\u2026            13,3\u2026          \n  deri\u2026                                       \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  trad\u2026       111,\u2026            121,\u2026          \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Trad\u2026                                       \n  liab\u2026                                       \n  Short       18,7\u2026            17,4\u2026          \n  sale                                        \n  Gross                                       \n  trad\u2026       51,2\u2026            33,8\u2026          \n  deri\u2026                                       \n  liab\u2026                                       \n  Nett\u2026       -39,\u2026            -26,\u2026          \n  (1)                                         \n  Total                                       \n  trad\u2026       11,9\u2026            7,787          \n  deri\u2026                                       \n  liab\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  trad\u2026    $  30,7\u2026            25,2\u2026          \n  liab\u2026                                       \n                                              \n(1) Represents balance sheet netting for\ntrading derivative asset and liability\nbalances, and trading portfolio level\ncounterparty valuation adjustments.\nTable 4.2 provides a summary of the net\ninterest income earned from trading\nsecurities, and net gains and losses due to\nthe realized and unrealized gains and losses\nfrom trading activities.

For\nadditional information, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies).\nCredit Quality We monitor credit quality of\ndebt securities by evaluating various\nattributes and utilize such information in our\nevaluation of the appropriateness of the\nallowance for credit losses. The credit\nquality indicators that we most closely\nmonitor include credit ratings and delinquency\nstatus and are based on information as of our\nfinancial statement date. CREDIT RATINGS\nCredit ratings express opinions about the\ncredit quality of a debt security. We\ndetermine the credit rating of a security\naccording to the lowest credit rating made\navailable by national recognized statistical\nrating organizations (NRSROs). Debt securities\nrated investment grade, that is those with\nratings similar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as\ndefined by NRSROs, are generally considered by\nthe rating agencies and market participants to\nbe low credit risk. Conversely, debt\nsecurities rated below investment grade,\nlabeled as \u201cspeculative grade\u201d by the rating\nagencies, are considered to be distinctively\nhigher credit risk than investment grade debt\nsecurities. For debt securities not rated by\nNRSROs, we determine an internal credit grade\nof the debt securities (used for credit risk\nmanagement purposes) equivalent to the credit\nratings assigned by major credit agencies.\nSubstantially all of our debt securities were\nrated by NRSROs at September 30, 2020, and\nDecember 31, 2019.\n\n82\n\nTable 5.4 shows the percentage of fair value\nof

whether debt securities we own are\npast due in payment of principal or interest\npayments and whether any securities have been\nplaced into nonaccrual status. We had nodebt\nsecurities that were past due and still\naccruing at September 30, 2020 or December 31,\n2019. The fair value of available-for-sale\ndebt securities in nonaccrual status was $\n98million and $ 110million as of September 30,\n2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nThere were noheld-to- maturity debt securities\nin nonaccrual status as of September 30, 2020,\nor December 31, 2019. Purchased debt\nsecurities with credit deterioration (PCD) are\nnot considered to be in nonaccrual status, as\npayments from issuers of these securities\nremain current. Table 5.5 presents detail of\navailable-for-sale debt securities purchased\nwith credit deterioration during the period.\nThere were noavailable-for-sale debt\nsecurities purchased with credit deterioration\nduring third quarter 2020. There were noheld-\nto-maturity debt securities purchased with\ncredit deterioration during the third quarter\nand first nine months of 2020. The amounts\npresented are as of the date of the PCD assets\nwere purchased.\n\nTable 5.5: Debt Securities Purchased with\nCredit Deterioration\n                                              \n                            Nine months       \n                            ended September   \n                            30,               \n  (in millions)             2020              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Available-for\u2026                              \n  debt                                        \n  securities                                  \n  purchased with                              \n  credit                                      \n  deterioration                               \n  (PCD):                                      \n  Par value         $  164                    \n  Allowance for                               \n  credit losses        -11                    \n  at                                          \n  acquisition                                 \n  Discount (or                                \n  premiums)                                   \n  attributable           3                    \n  to                                          \n  other factors                               \n  Purchase price                              \n  of                                          \n  available-for\u2026                              \n  debt              $  156                    \n  securities                                  \n  purchased with                              \n  credit                                      \n  deterioration                               \n                                              \n                                            83\nNote 5: Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\nMaturity Debt Securities (continued)\n\nUnrealized Losses of Available-for-Sale Debt\nSecurities Table 5.6 shows the gross\nunrealized losses and fair value of available-\nfor-sale debt securities by length of time\nthose individual securities in each category\nhave been in a continuous loss position.

As part of that\nassessment we evaluated and concluded that we\ndo not intend to sell any of the debt\nsecurities, and that it is more likely than\nnot that we will not be required to sell,\nprior to recovery of the amortized cost basis.\nWe evaluate, where necessary, whether credit\nimpairment exists by comparing the present\nvalue of the expected cash flows to the debt\nsecurities\u2019 amortized cost basis. In prior\nperiods, credit impairment was recorded as a\nwrite-down to the amortized cost basis of the\nsecurity. In the current period, credit\nimpairment is recorded as an allowance for\ncredit losses for debt securities.

We\ngenerally require a\nfee to extend such\ncommitments. Certain\ncommitments are\nsubject to loan\nagreements with\ncovenants regarding\nthe financial\nperformance of the\ncustomer or borrowing\nbase formulas on an\nongoing basis that\nmust be met before we\nare required to fund\nthe commitment. We may\nreduce or cancel\nconsumer commitments,\nincluding home equity\nlines and credit card\nlines, in accordance\nwith the contracts and\napplicable law. We\nmay, as a\nrepresentative for\nother lenders, advance\nfunds or provide for\nthe issuance of\nletters of credit\nunder syndicated loan\nor letter of credit\nagreements. Any\nadvances are generally\nrepaid in less than a\nweek and would\nnormally require\ndefault of both the\ncustomer and another\nlender to expose us to\nloss. The unfunded\namount of these\ntemporary advance\narrangements totaled\napproximately $\n79.9billion at\nSeptember 30, 2020. We\nissue commercial\nletters of credit to\nassist customers in\npurchasing goods or\nservices, typically\nfor international\ntrade. At September\n30, 2020, and December\n31, 2019, we had $\n942million and $\n862million,\nrespectively, of\noutstanding issued\ncommercial letters of\ncredit. We also\noriginate multipurpose\nlending commitments\nunder which borrowers\nhave the option to\ndraw on the facility\nfor different purposes\nin one of several\nforms, including a\nstandby letter of\ncredit. See Note 13\n(Guarantees, Pledged\nAssets and Collateral,\nand Other Commitments)\nfor additional\ninformation on standby\nletters of credit.\nWhen we make\ncommitments, we are\nexposed to credit\nrisk. The maximum\ncredit risk for these\ncommitments will\ngenerally be lower\nthan the contractual\namount because a\nsignificant portion of\nthese commitments are\nnot funded. We manage\nthe potential risk in\ncommitments to lend by\nlimiting the total\namount of commitments,\nboth by individual\ncustomer and in total,\nby monitoring the size\nand maturity structure\nof these commitments\nand by applying the\nsame credit standards\nfor these commitments\nas for all of our\ncredit activities.\n\nFor loans and\ncommitments to lend,\nwe generally require\ncollateral or a\nguarantee. We may\nrequire various types\nof collateral,\nincluding commercial\nand consumer real\nestate, automobiles,\nother short-term\nliquid assets such as\naccounts receivable or\ninventory and long-\nlived assets, such as\nequipment and other\nbusiness assets.\nCollateral\nrequirements for each\nloan or commitment may\nvary based on the loan\nproduct and our\nassessment of a\ncustomer\u2019s credit risk\naccording to the\nspecific credit\nunderwriting,\nincluding credit terms\nand structure.\nThe contractual amount\nof our unfunded credit\ncommitments, including\nunissued standby and\ncommercial letters of\ncredit, is summarized\nby portfolio segment\nand class of financing\nreceivable in Table\n6.4.

The credit quality indicators are\ngenerally based on information as of our\nfinancial statement date, with the exception\nof updated Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO)\nscores and updated loan-to-value\n(LTV)/combined LTV (CLTV). We obtain FICO\nscores at loan origination and the scores are\ngenerally updated at least quarterly, except\nin limited circumstances, including compliance\nwith the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).\nGenerally, the LTV and CLTV indicators are\nupdated in the second month of each quarter,\nwith updates no older than June 30, 2020.\nAmounts disclosed in the credit quality tables\nthat follow are not comparative between\nreported periods due to our adoption of CECL\non January 1, 2020. For additional\ninformation, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies). COMMERCIAL\nCREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS We manage a\nconsistent process for assessing commercial\nloan credit quality. Generally, commercial\nloans are subject to individual risk\nassessment using our internal borrower and\ncollateral quality ratings, which is our\nprimary credit quality indicator. Our ratings\nare aligned to federal banking regulators\u2019\ndefinitions of pass and criticized categories\nwith the criticized category including special\nmention, substandard, doubtful, and loss\ncategories. Table 6.8 provides the outstanding\nbalances of our commercial loan portfolio by\nrisk category. In connection with our adoption\nof CECL, credit quality information is\nprovided with the year of origination for term\nloans. Revolving loans may convert to term\nloans as a result of a contractual provision\nin the original loan agreement or if modified\nin a TDR. At September 30, 2020, we had $\n444.9billion and $ 37.3billion of pass and\ncriticized loans, respectively.\n\nTable 6.8: Commercial Loans Categories by Risk\nCategories and Vintage (1)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Disclosure is not comparative due to our\nadoption of CECL on January 1, 2020.

Table 6.10 provides the outstanding\nbalances of our consumer loan portfolio by\ndelinquency status. Payment deferral\nactivities instituted in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic may delay recognition of\ndelinquencies for customers who otherwise\nwould have moved into past due status. In\nconnection with our adoption of CECL, credit\nquality information is provided with the year\nof origination for term loans. Revolving loans\nmay convert to term loans as a result of a\ncontractual provision in the original loan\nagreement or if modified in a TDR. The\nrevolving loans converted to term loans in the\ncredit card loan category represent credit\ncard loans with modified terms that require\npayment over a specific term.\n                                            93\nNote 6: Loans and Related Allowance for Credit\nLosses (continued)\n\nTable 6.10: Consumer Loan Categories by\nDelinquency Status and Vintage (1)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(continued on following page)\n\n94\n\n(continued from previous page)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      1      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      1      \u2014      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2014      \u2014      \u2014      \u2014      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2014      \u2014      \u2014      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) Disclosure is not comparative due to our\nadoption of CECL on January 1, 2020.

Loans\ninsured/guaranteed by the FHA/VA and 90+ DPD\ntotaled $ 11.0billion at September 30, 2020,\ncompared with $ 6.4billion at December 31,\n2019.\n\n(3) 26% of the adjusted unpaid principal\nbalance for consumer PCI loans was 30+ DPD at\nDecember 31, 2019.\n\nOf the $ 1.9billion of consumer loans not\ngovernment insured/guaranteed that are 90 days\nor more past due at September 30, 2020, $\n549million was accruing, compared with $\n1.9billion past due and $ 855million accruing\nat December 31, 2019. Table 6.11 provides the\noutstanding balances of our consumer loan\nportfolio by FICO score. Substantially all of\nthe scored consumer portfolio has an updated\nFICO score of 680 and above, reflecting a\nstrong current borrower credit profile. FICO\nscores are not available for certain loan\ntypes, or may not be required if we deem it\nunnecessary due to strong collateral and other\nborrower attributes. Loans not requiring a\nFICO score totaled $ 11.3billion and $\n9.1billion at September 30, 2020, and December\n31, 2019, respectively. Substantially all\nloans not requiring a FICO score are\nsecurities-based loans originated through\nretail brokerage.\n                                            95\nNote 6: Loans and Related Allowance for Credit\nLosses (continued)\n\nTable 6.11: Consumer Loan Categories by FICO\nand Vintage (1)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(continued on next page)\n\n96\n\n(continued from prior page)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2014      \u2014      \u2014      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2014      \u2014      \u2014      \u2014      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2014      \u2014      \u2014      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) Disclosure is not comparative due to our\nadoption of CECL on January 1, 2020.

CLTV refers to the\ncombination of first mortgage and junior lien\nmortgage (including unused line amounts for\ncredit line products) ratios. LTVs and CLTVs\nare updated quarterly using a cascade approach\nwhich first uses values provided by automated\nvaluation models (AVMs) for the property. If\nan AVM is not available, then the value is\nestimated using the original appraised value\nadjusted by the change in Home Price Index\n(HPI) for the property location. If an HPI is\nnot available, the original appraised value is\nused. The HPI value is normally the only\nmethod considered for high value properties,\ngenerally with an original value of $ 1million\nor more, as the AVM values have proven less\naccurate for these properties. Table 6.12\nshows the most updated LTV and CLTV\ndistribution of the real estate 1-4 family\nfirst and junior lien mortgage loan\nportfolios. We consider the trends in\nresidential real estate markets as we monitor\ncredit risk and establish our allowance for\ncredit losses. In the event of a default, any\nloss should be limited to the portion of the\nloan amount in excess of the net realizable\nvalue of the underlying real estate collateral\nvalue. Certain loans do not have an LTV or\nCLTV due to industry data availability and\nportfolios acquired from or serviced by other\ninstitutions.\n                                            97\nNote 6: Loans and Related Allowance for Credit\nLosses (continued)\n\nTable 6.12: Consumer Loan Categories by\nLTV/CLTV and Vintage (1)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Disclosure is not comparative due to our\nadoption of CECL on January 1, 2020.

Our impaired\nloans at December 31, 2019, predominantly\nincluded loans on nonaccrual status in the\ncommercial portfolio segment and loans\nmodified in a TDR, whether on accrual or\nnonaccrual status. Impaired loans generally\nhad estimated losses which are included in the\nallowance for credit losses. We did have\nimpaired loans with no allowance for credit\nlosses when the loss content has been\npreviously recognized through charge-offs,\nsuch as collateral dependent loans, or when\nloans are currently performing in accordance\nwith their terms and no loss has been\nestimated. Impaired loans excluded PCI loans\nand loans that had been fully charged off or\notherwise had zero recorded investment.

of time to a borrower that we would not\notherwise consider, the related loan is\nclassified as a TDR, the balance of which\ntotaled $ 14.6billion and $ 11.8billion at\nSeptember 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019,\nrespectively. We do not consider loan\nresolutions such as foreclosure or short sale\nto be a TDR. In addition, COVID-related\nmodifications are generally not classified as\nTDRs due to the relief under the CARES Act and\nthe Interagency Statement. For additional\ninformation on the TDR relief, see Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).\nWe may require some consumer borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty to make\ntrial payments generally for a period of three\nto four months, according to the terms of a\nplanned permanent modification, to determine\nif they can perform according to those terms.\nThese arrangements represent trial\nmodifications, which we classify and account\nfor as TDRs. While loans are in trial payment\nprograms, their original terms are not\nconsidered modified and they continue to\nadvance through delinquency status and accrue\ninterest according to their original terms.\nCommitments to lend additional funds on loans\nwhose terms have been modified in a TDR\namounted to $ 477million and $ 500million at\nSeptember 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019,\nrespectively.\n\n102\nTable 6.17 summarizes our TDR modifications\nfor the periods presented by primary\nmodification type and includes the financial\neffects of these modifications. For those\nloans that modify more than once, the table\nreflects each modification that occurred\nduring the period. Loans that both modify and\npay off within the period, as well as changes\nin recorded investment during the period for\nloans modified in prior periods, are not\nincluded in the table.\nTable 6.17: TDR Modifications\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(continued on following page)\n                                           103\nNote 6: Loans and Related Allowance for Credit\nLosses (continued)\n\n(continued from previous page)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Amounts represent the recorded investment\nin loans after recognizing the effects of the\nTDR, if any. TDRs may have multiple types of\nconcessions, but are presented only once in\nthe first modification type based on the order\npresented in the table above.

The amount of charge-\noff will differ from the modification terms if\nthe loan has been charged down prior to the\nmodification based on our policies. In\naddition, there may be cases where we have a\ncharge-off/down with no legal principal\nmodification. Modifications resulted in\ndeferring or legally forgiving principal of $\n2million and $ 16million for the quarters\nended September 30, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively, and $ 34million and $ 22million\nfor the first nine months of 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\n\n(4) Reflects the effect of reduced interest\nrates on loans with an interest rate\nconcession as one of its concession types,\nwhich includes loans reported as a principal\nprimary modification type that also have an\ninterest rate concession.\n\n(5) Trial modifications are granted a delay in\npayments due under the original terms during\nthe trial payment period. However, these loans\ncontinue to advance through delinquency status\nand accrue interest according to their\noriginal terms.

These securities include private\nequity and tax credit investments, securities\nheld as economic hedges or to meet regulatory\nrequirements (for example, Federal Reserve\nBank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock). FAIR\nVALUE Marketable equity securities held for\npurposes other than trading consist of\nexchange-traded equity funds held to\neconomically hedge obligations related to our\ndeferred compensation plans, as well as other\nholdings of publicly traded equity securities\nheld for investment purposes. We account for\ncertain nonmarketable equity securities under\nthe fair value method, and substantially all\nof these securities are economically hedged\nwith equity derivatives. EQUITY METHOD Our\nequity method investments consist of tax\ncredit and private equity investments, the\nmajority of which are our low income housing\ntax credit (LIHTC) investments. We invest in\naffordable housing projects that qualify for\nthe LIHTC, which are designed to promote\nprivate development of low income housing.\nThese investments typically generate a return\nthrough realization of federal tax credit and\nother tax benefits. In the third quarter and\nfirst nine months of 2020, we recognized pre-\ntax losses of $ 336million and $ 1.0billion,\nrespectively, related to our LIHTC\ninvestments, compared with $ 304million and $\n875million, respectively, for the same periods\na year ago. These losses were recognized in\nother noninterest income. We also recognized\ntotal tax benefits of $ 422million and $\n1.2billion in the third quarter and first nine\nmonths of 2020, respectively, which included\ntax credits recorded to income taxes of $\n339million and $ 970million for the same\nperiods, respectively. In the third quarter\nand first nine months of 2019, total tax\nbenefits were $ 362million and $ 1.1billion,\nrespectively, which included tax credits of $\n286million and $ 891million for the same\nperiods, respectively. We are periodically\nrequired to provide additional financial\nsupport during the investment period. A\nliability is recognized for unfunded\ncommitments that are both legally binding and\nprobable of funding. These commitments are\npredominantly funded within three yearsof\ninitial investment. Our liability for these\nunfunded commitments was $ 4.0billion at\nSeptember 30, 2020, and $ 4.3billion at\nDecember 31, 2019. This liability for unfunded\ncommitments is included in long-term debt.\nOTHER The remaining portion of our\nnonmarketable equity securities portfolio\nconsists of securities accounted for using the\ncost or measurement alternative.\n                                           107\n                                              \n  Note 8:  Equity Securities (continued)      \n                                              \nRealized Gains and Losses Not Held for Trading\nTable 8.2 provides a summary of the net gains\nand losses from equity securities not held for\ntrading.

These\namounts represent the carrying value of the\nloans and associated debt that would be\npayable if the option was exercised to\nrepurchase eligible loans from GNMA\nresidential and multifamily loan\nsecuritizations. These amounts are excluded\nfrom maximum exposure to loss as we are not\nobligated to exercise the options.\n\nIn Table 10.2, \u201cTotal VIE assets\u201d represents\nthe remaining principal balance of assets held\nby unconsolidated VIEs using the most current\ninformation available. For VIEs that obtain\nexposure to assets synthetically through\nderivative instruments, the notional amount of\nthe derivative is included in the asset\nbalance. \u201cCarrying value\u201d is the amount in our\nconsolidated balance sheet related to our\ninvolvement with the unconsolidated VIEs.\n\u201cMaximum exposure to loss\u201d is determined as\nthe carrying value of our investment in the\nVIEs excluding the unconditional repurchase\noptions that have not been exercised, plus the\nremaining undrawn liquidity and lending\ncommitments, the notional amount of net\nwritten derivative contracts, and generally\n                                           111\nNote 10: Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities ( continued )\n\nthe notional amount of, or stressed loss\nestimate for, other commitments and\nguarantees. It represents estimated loss that\nwould be incurred under severe, hypothetical\ncircumstances, for which we believe the\npossibility is extremely remote, such as where\nthe value of our interests and any associated\ncollateral declines to zero, without any\nconsideration of recovery or offset from any\neconomic hedges. Accordingly, this disclosure\nis not an indication of expected loss. For\ncomplete descriptions of our transactions with\nunconsolidated VIEs with which we have a\nsignificant continuing involvement, but we are\nnot the primary beneficiary, see Note 10\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities) in our 2019 Form 10-K. Loan Sales\nand Securitization Activity We periodically\ntransfer consumer and commercial loans and\nother types of financial assets in\nsecuritization and whole loan sale\ntransactions. We typically retain the\nservicing rights from these sales and may\ncontinue to hold other beneficial interests in\nthe transferred financial assets. We may also\nprovide liquidity to investors in the\nbeneficial interests and credit enhancements.\nThrough these transfers we may be exposed to\nliability under limited amounts of recourse as\nwell as standard representations and\nwarranties we make to purchasers and issuers.\nTable 10.3 presents information about\ntransfers of assets during the period to\nunconsolidated VIEs or third-party investors\nfor which we recorded the transfers as sales\nand have continuing involvement with the\ntransferred assets. In connection with these\ntransfers, we recorded servicing assets,\nsecurities, and a liability for repurchase\nlosses which reflects management\u2019s estimate of\nprobable losses related to various\nrepresentations and warranties for the loans\ntransferred. Each of these interests are\ninitially measured at fair value. Servicing\nrights are classified as Level 3 measurements,\nand generally securities are initially\nclassified as Level 2. Sales with continuing\ninvolvement include securitizations of\nconforming residential mortgages that are sold\nto the government-sponsored entities (GSEs) or\nGNMA. Substantially all transfers to these\nentities resulted in no gain or loss because\nthe loans were already measured at fair value\non a recurring basis.\n\nTable 10.3: Transfers With

Cash flows from other interests\nheld exclude cash flows from certain debt\nsecurities related to loans serviced for FNMA,\nFHLMC and GNMA and predominantly include\nprincipal and interest payments received on\nretained bonds. Repurchases of assets\nrepresent cash paid to repurchase loans from\ninvestors under representation and warranty\nobligations or in connection with the exercise\nof cleanup calls on securitizations. Loss\nreimbursements are cash paid to reimburse\ninvestors for losses on individual loans that\nare already liquidated. Repurchases of\ngovernment insured loans result from the\nexercise of our option, as servicer, to\nrepurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization\npools, when three scheduled loan payments\nremain unpaid by the borrower. These loans are\ninsured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA.\nCash flows from servicing advances include\nprincipal and interest payments to investors\nrequired by servicing

Prepayment assumptions do not\nsignificantly impact values of commercial MSRs\nand commercial mortgage bonds as commercial\nloans generally include contractual\nrestrictions on prepayment. Servicing costs\n\n114\n\nare not a driver of our MSR value as we are\ntypically primary or master servicer; the\nhigher costs of servicing delinquent and\nforeclosed loans is generally borne by the\nspecial servicer. The primary economic driver\nimpacting the fair value of our commercial\nMSRs is forward interest rates, which are\nderived from market observable yield curves\nused to price capital markets instruments.\nMarket interest rates significantly affect\ninterest earned on custodial deposit balances.\nThe sensitivity of the current fair value of\nour commercial MSRs to a hypothetical\nimmediate adverse 25% change in the assumption\nabout interest earned on deposit balances at\nSeptember 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019,\nwould result in a decrease in fair value of $\n89million and $ 205million, respectively. See\nNote 11 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for\nadditional information on our commercial MSRs.\nThe sensitivities in the preceding paragraph\nand table are hypothetical and caution should\nbe exercised when relying on this data.\nChanges in value based on variations in\nassumptions generally cannot be extrapolated\nbecause the relationship of the change in the\nassumption to the change in value may not be\nlinear. Also, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the value of the\nother interests held is calculated\nindependently without changing any other\nassumptions. In reality, changes in one factor\nmay result in changes in others (for example,\nchanges in prepayment speed estimates could\nresult in changes in the credit losses), which\nmight magnify or counteract the sensitivities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Loans Table 10.7 presents\ninformation about the principal balances of\noff-balance sheet loans that were sold or\nsecuritized, including residential mortgage\nloans sold to FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA and other\ninvestors, for which we have some form of\ncontinuing involvement (including servicer).\nDelinquent loans include loans 90 days or more\npast due and loans in bankruptcy, regardless\nof delinquency status. In accordance with\napplicable servicing guidelines, delinquency\nstatus continues to advance for loans with\nCOVID-related payment deferrals. For loans\nsold or securitized where servicing is our\nonly form of continuing involvement, we would\nonly experience a loss if we were required to\nrepurchase a delinquent loan or foreclosed\nasset due to a breach in representations and\nwarranties associated with our loan sale or\nservicing contracts.\n\nTable 10.7: Off-Balance Sheet Loans Sold or\nSecuritized\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      2      2      \u2014      \u2014    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) Includes $ 397million and $ 492million of\ncommercial foreclosed assets and $ 264million\nand $ 356million of consumer foreclosed assets\nat September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019,\nrespectively.\n\n(2) Net charge-offs exclude loans sold to\nFNMA, FHLMC and GNMA as we do not service or\nmanage the underlying real estate upon\nforeclosure and, as such, do not have access\nto net charge-off information.\n\n(3) At September 30, 2020, and December 31,\n2019, the table includes total loans of $\n920.7billion and $ 1.0trillion respectively,\ndelinquent loans of $ 35.0billion and $\n5.2billion, respectively, and foreclosed\nassets of $ 205million and $ 251million,\nrespectively, for FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA.\n                                           115\nNote 10: Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities ( continued )\n\nTransactions with Consolidated VIEs and\nSecured Borrowings Table 10.8 presents a\nsummary of financial assets and liabilities\nfor asset transfers accounted for as secured\nborrowings and involvements with consolidated\nVIEs.

We also consolidate VIEs\nwhere we are the primary beneficiary. In\ncertain transactions, we provide contractual\nsupport in the form of limited recourse and\nliquidity to facilitate the remarketing of\nshort-term securities issued to third-party\ninvestors. Other than this limited contractual\nsupport, the assets of the VIEs are the sole\nsource of repayment of the securities held by\nthird parties. For complete descriptions of\nour accounting for transfers accounted for as\nsecured borrowings and involvement with\nconsolidated VIEs, see Note 10\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities) in our 2019 Form 10-K. Other\nTransactions In addition to the transactions\nincluded in the previous tables, we have used\nwholly-owned trust preferred security VIEs to\nissue debt securities or preferred equity\nexclusively to third-party investors. As the\nsole assets of the VIEs are receivables from\nus, we do not consolidate the VIEs even though\nwe own all of the voting equity shares of the\nVIEs, have fully guaranteed the obligations of\nthe VIEs, and may have the right to redeem the\nthird-party securities under certain\ncircumstances. In our\n\nconsolidated balance sheet we reported the\ndebt securities issued to the VIEs as long-\nterm junior subordinated debt with a carrying\nvalue of $ 698million and $ 2.1billion at\nSeptember 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019,\nrespectively. During first quarter 2020, we\nliquidated certain of our trust preferred\nsecurity VIEs. As part of these liquidations,\nthe preferred securities issued by the trusts\nwere canceled and junior subordinated\ndebentures with a total carrying value of $\n1.4billion were distributed to the preferred\nsecurity holders. Prior to the liquidations,\nwe held $ 10million of these preferred\nsecurities, which were exchanged for junior\nsubordinated debentures upon liquidation and\nsubsequently retired with noimpact to\nearnings. See Note 17 (Preferred Stock) for\nadditional information about trust preferred\nsecurities.\n\nCertain money market funds are also excluded\nfrom the previous tables because they are\nexempt from the consolidation analysis. We\nvoluntarily waived a portion of our management\nfees for these money market funds to maintain\na minimum level of daily net investment\nincome. The amount of fees waived was $\n30million and $ 63million in the third quarter\nand first nine months of 2020, respectively,\ncompared with $ 10million and $ 30million for\nthe same periods a year ago.\n\n116\n                                         \n  Note 11:  Mortgage Banking Activities  \n                                         \nMortgage banking activities consist of\nresidential and commercial mortgage\noriginations, sales and servicing.

As the servicer of\nloans for others, we advance certain payments\nof principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and\ndefault-related expenses which are generally\nreimbursed within a short timeframe from cash\nflows from the trust, GSEs, insurer or\nborrower. The credit risk related to these\nadvances is limited since the reimbursement is\ngenerally senior to cash payments to\ninvestors. We also advance payments of taxes\nand insurance for our owned loans which are\ncollectible from the borrower. We maintain an\nallowance for uncollectible amounts for\nadvances on loans serviced for others that may\nnot be reimbursed if the payments were not\nmade in accordance with applicable servicing\nagreements or if the insurance or servicing\nagreements contain limitations on\nreimbursements. Servicing advances on owned\nloans are charged-off when deemed\nuncollectible.

Carrying value net asset\nposition is a result of certain deferred\npremium option trades.\n(2) Represent recourse provided, predominantly\nto the GSEs, on loans sold under various\nprograms and arrangements.\n(3) Includes indemnifications provided to\ncertain third-party clearing agents.\nOutstanding customer obligations under these\narrangements were $ 176million and $ 80million\nwith related collateral of $ 1.5billion and $\n696million at September 30, 2020, and December\n31, 2019, respectively.\n\u201cMaximum exposure to loss\u201d and \u201cNon-investment\ngrade\u201d are required disclosures under GAAP.\nMaximum exposure to loss represents the\nestimated loss that would be incurred under an\nassumed hypothetical circumstance, despite\nwhat we believe is a remote possibility, where\nthe value of our interests and any associated\ncollateral declines to zero. Maximum exposure\nto loss estimates in Table 13.1 do not reflect\neconomic hedges or collateral we could use to\noffset or recover losses we may incur under\nour guarantee agreements. Accordingly, this\nrequired disclosure is not an indication of\nexpected loss. We believe the carrying value\nis more representative of our exposure to loss\nthan maximum exposure to loss. The carrying\nvalue represents the fair value of the\nguarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL\nfor guarantees, if applicable. Non-investment\ngrade represents those guarantees on which we\nhave a higher risk of performance under the\nterms of the guarantee. If the underlying\nassets under the guarantee are non-investment\ngrade (that is, an external rating that is\nbelow investment grade or an internal credit\ndefault grade that is equivalent to a below\ninvestment grade external rating), we consider\nthe risk of performance to be high. Internal\ncredit default grades are determined based\nupon the same credit policies that we use to\nevaluate the risk of payment or performance\nwhen making loans and other extensions of\ncredit. Credit quality indicators we usually\nconsider in evaluating risk of payments or\nperformance are described in Note 6 (Loans and\nRelated Allowance for Credit Losses). We\nprovide debit and credit card transaction\nprocessing services through the payment\nnetworks directly for merchants and as a\nsponsor for merchant processing servicers,\nincluding our joint venture with a third party\nthat is accounted for as an equity method\ninvestment. In our role as the merchant\nacquiring bank, we have a potential obligation\nfor payment and delivery disputes between the\nmerchant and the cardholder that are resolved\nin favor of the cardholder. If we are unable\nto collect the amounts from the merchant, we\nincur a loss for the refund to the cardholder.\nWe are secondarily obligated to make a refund\nfor transactions involving the sponsored\nmerchant processing servicers. We have a low\nlikelihood of loss since most products and\nservices are delivered when purchased and\namounts are refunded when items are returned\nto the merchant. In addition, we may reduce\nour risk by withholding future payments and\nrequiring cash or other collateral. For the\nfirst nine months of 2020, we processed card\ntransaction volume of $ 982.7billion as a\nmerchant acquiring bank, and related losses,\nincluding those from our joint venture entity,\nwere immaterial. The Parent fully and\nunconditionally guarantees the payment of\nprincipal, interest, and any other amounts\nthat may be due on securities that its 100%\nowned finance subsidiary, Wells Fargo Finance\nLLC, may issue. These guaranteed liabilities\nwere $ 2.4billion and $ 1.6billion at\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019,\nrespectively. These guarantees rank on parity\nwith all of the Parent\u2019s other unsecured and\nunsubordinated indebtedness.\n120\n\nPledged Assets Table 13.2 provides the\ncarrying amount of on-balance sheet pledged\nassets and the fair value of other pledged\ncollateral. Other pledged collateral is\ncollateral we have received from third\nparties, have the right to repledge and is not\nrecognized on our balance sheet. TRADING\nRELATED ACTIVITY Our trading businesses may\npledge debt and equity securities in\nconnection with securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase (repurchase\nagreements) and securities lending\narrangements. The collateral that we pledge\nrelated to our trading activities may include\nour own collateral as well as collateral that\nwe have received from third parties and have\nthe right to repledge. All of the trading\nactivity pledged collateral is eligible to be\nrepledged or sold by the secured party. NON-\nTRADING RELATED ACTIVITY As part of our\nliquidity management strategy, we may pledge\nloans, debt securities, and other assets to\nsecure trust and public deposits, borrowings\nand letters of credit from the Federal Home\nLoan Bank (FHLB) and FRB and for other\npurposes as required or permitted by law or\ninsurance statutory requirements.\nSubstantially all of the non-trading activity\npledged collateral is not eligible to be\nrepledged or sold by the secured party. VIE\nRELATED We pledge assets in connection with\nvarious types of transactions entered into\nwith VIEs. These pledged assets can only be\nused to settle the liabilities of those\nentities. We also have loans recorded on our\nbalance sheet which represent certain\ndelinquent loans that are eligible for\nrepurchase from GNMA loan securitizations. See\nNote 10 (Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities) for additional information on\nconsolidated VIE assets and VIEs accounted for\nas secured borrowings.\n\nTable 13.2: Pledged Assets\n                                              \n                     Sep              Dec     \n  (in                30,              31,     \n  mill\u2026              2020             2019    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Rela\u2026                                       \n  to                                          \n  trad\u2026                                       \n  acti\u2026                                       \n  Repl\u2026                                       \n  thir\u2026                                       \n  owned                                       \n  debt     $  37,1\u2026            60,0\u2026          \n  and                                         \n  equi\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Trad\u2026                                       \n  debt                                        \n  secu\u2026       20,4\u2026            51,0\u2026          \n  and                                         \n  other                                       \n  Equi\u2026         835            1,379          \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  pled\u2026                                       \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  rela\u2026       58,4\u2026            112,\u2026          \n  to                                          \n  trad\u2026                                       \n  acti\u2026                                       \n  Rela\u2026                                       \n  to                                          \n  non-\u2026                                       \n  acti\u2026                                       \n  Loans       364,\u2026            406,\u2026          \n  Debt                                        \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Avai\u2026       55,4\u2026            61,1\u2026          \n  Held\u2026       2,786            3,685          \n  Mort\u2026                                       \n  loans                                       \n  held            \u2014            2,266          \n  for                                         \n  sale                                        \n  Total                                       \n  pled\u2026                                       \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  rela\u2026       423,\u2026            473,\u2026          \n  to                                          \n  non-\u2026                                       \n  acti\u2026                                       \n  Rela\u2026                                       \n  to                                          \n  VIEs:                                       \n  Cons\u2026                                       \n  VIE         11,5\u2026            14,3\u2026          \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  VIEs                                        \n  acco\u2026                                       \n  for            69               80          \n  as                                          \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  borr\u2026                                       \n  Loans                                       \n  elig\u2026                                       \n  for                                         \n  repu\u2026          76              568          \n  from                                        \n  GNMA                                        \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  pled\u2026                                       \n  asse\u2026       11,7\u2026            15,0\u2026          \n  rela\u2026                                       \n  to                                          \n  VIEs                                        \n  Total                                       \n  pled\u2026    $  493,\u2026            600,\u2026          \n  asse\u2026                                       \n                                              \nSecurities Financing Activities We enter into\nresale and repurchase agreements and\nsecurities borrowing and lending agreements\n(collectively, \u201csecurities financing\nactivities\u201d) typically to finance trading\npositions (including securities and\nderivatives), acquire securities to cover\nshort trading positions, accommodate\ncustomers\u2019 financing needs, and settle other\nsecurities obligations. These activities are\nconducted through our broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries and to a lesser extent through\nother bank entities. Our securities financing\nactivities primarily involve high quality,\nliquid securities such as U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and government agency securities,\nand to a lesser extent, less liquid\nsecurities, including equity securities,\ncorporate bonds and asset-backed securities.\nWe account for these transactions as\ncollateralized financings in which we\ntypically receive or pledge securities as\ncollateral. We believe these financing\ntransactions generally do not have material\ncredit risk given the collateral provided and\nthe related monitoring processes. OFFSETTING\nOF SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES Table 13.3\npresents resale and repurchase agreements\nsubject to master repurchase agreements (MRA)\nand securities borrowing and lending\nagreements subject to master securities\nlending agreements (MSLA). Collateralized\nfinancings with a single counterparty are\npresented net on our balance sheet, provided\ncertain criteria are met that permit balance\nsheet netting. Most transactions subject to\nthese agreements do not meet those criteria\nand thus are not eligible for balance sheet\nnetting. Collateral we pledged consists of\nnon-cash instruments, such as securities or\nloans, and is not netted on the balance sheet\nagainst the related liability. Collateral we\nreceived includes securities or loans and is\nnot recognized on our balance sheet.\nCollateral pledged or received may be\nincreased or decreased over time to maintain\ncertain contractual thresholds, as the assets\nunderlying each arrangement fluctuate in\nvalue. Generally, these agreements require\ncollateral to exceed the asset or liability\nrecognized on the balance sheet. The following\ntable includes the amount of collateral\npledged or received related to exposures\nsubject to enforceable MRAs or MSLAs.

These\namounts include securities we have sold or\nrepledged to others with a fair value of $\n35.9billion at September 30, 2020, and $\n59.1billion at December 31, 2019.\n\n(4) Represents the amount of our exposure\n(assets) or obligation (liabilities) that is\nnot collateralized and/or is not subject to an\nenforceable MRA or MSLA.\n\n(5) Amount is classified in short-term\nborrowings on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n(6) Represents the fair value of collateral we\nhave pledged, related to enforceable MRAs or\nMSLAs, limited in the table above to the\namount of the recognized liability owed to\neach counterparty.

In these transactions, we receive\ncash in exchange for transferring securities\nas collateral and recognize an obligation to\nreacquire the securities for cash at the\ntransaction\u2019s maturity. These types of\ntransactions create risks, including (1) the\ncounterparty may fail to return the securities\nat maturity, (2) the fair value of the\nsecurities transferred may decline below the\namount of our obligation to reacquire the\nsecurities, and therefore create an obligation\nfor us to pledge additional amounts, and (3)\nthe counterparty may accelerate the maturity\non demand, requiring us to reacquire the\nsecurity prior to contractual maturity. We\nattempt to mitigate these risks in various\nways. Our collateral primarily consists of\nhighly liquid securities. In addition, we\nunderwrite and monitor the financial strength\nof our counterparties, monitor the fair value\nof collateral pledged relative to\ncontractually required repurchase amounts, and\nmonitor that our collateral is properly\nreturned through the clearing and settlement\nprocess in advance of our cash repayment.\nTable 13.4 provides the gross amounts\nrecognized on the balance sheet (before the\neffects of offsetting) of our liabilities for\nrepurchase and securities lending agreements\ndisaggregated by underlying collateral type.\n\n122\n\nTable 13.4: Gross Obligations by Underlying\nCollateral Type\n                                              \n                      Sep              Dec    \n  (in                 30,              31,    \n  mill\u2026               2020             2019   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Repu\u2026                                       \n  agre\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  U.S.                                        \n  Trea\u2026    $  22,342           48,161         \n  and                                         \n  fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  U.S.                                        \n  Stat\u2026           46              104         \n  and                                         \n  poli\u2026                                       \n  subd\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026       13,184           44,737         \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Non-\u2026                                       \n  mort\u2026        1,176            1,818         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Corp\u2026                                       \n  debt         8,780            7,126         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Asse\u2026        1,050            1,844         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Equi\u2026        1,463            1,674         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Other          830              705         \n  Total       48,871           106,1\u2026         \n  repu\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  lend\u2026                                       \n  arra\u2026                                       \n  Secu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  U.S.                                        \n  Trea\u2026           57              163         \n  and                                         \n  fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026                                       \n  agen\u2026           42                \u2014         \n  mort\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Corp\u2026                                       \n  debt            98              223         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  Equi\u2026                                       \n  secu\u2026        5,788            4,481         \n  (1)                                         \n  Other           32                2         \n  Total                                       \n  secu\u2026        6,017            4,869         \n  lend\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  repu\u2026                                       \n  and      $  54,888           111,0\u2026         \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  lend\u2026                                       \n                                              \n(1) Equity securities are generally exchange\ntraded and represent collateral received from\nthird parties that has been repledged.

As of\nSeptember 30, 2020,\nand December 31, 2019,\nwe had commitments to\npurchase debt\nsecurities of $\n18million in both\nperiods and\ncommitments to\npurchase equity\nsecurities of $\n3.2billion and $\n2.7billion,\nrespectively. As part\nof maintaining our\nmemberships in certain\nclearing\norganizations, we are\nrequired to stand\nready to provide\nliquidity to sustain\nmarket clearing\nactivity in the event\nunforeseen events\noccur or are deemed\nlikely to occur.\nCertain of these\nobligations are\nguarantees of other\nmembers\u2019 performance\nand accordingly are\nincluded in Other\nguarantees and\nindemnifications in\nTable 13.1.\n\nAlso, we have\ncommitments to\npurchase loans and\nsecurities under\nresale agreements from\ncertain\ncounterparties,\nincluding central\nclearing\norganizations. The\namount of our unfunded\ncontractual\ncommitments was $\n9.1billion and $\n7.5billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2020,\nand December 31, 2019,\nrespectively. Given\nthe nature of these\ncommitments, they are\nexcluded from Table\n6.4 (Unfunded Credit\nCommitments) in Note 6\n(Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses).\n                                           123\n                           \n  Note 14:  Legal Actions  \n                           \nWells Fargo and certain of our subsidiaries\nare involved in a number of judicial,\nregulatory, governmental, arbitration, and\nother proceedings or investigations concerning\nmatters arising from the conduct of our\nbusiness activities, and many of those\nproceedings and investigations expose Wells\nFargo to potential financial loss. These\nproceedings and investigations include actions\nbrought against Wells Fargo and/or our\nsubsidiaries with respect to corporate-related\nmatters and transactions in which Wells Fargo\nand/or our subsidiaries were involved. In\naddition, Wells Fargo and our subsidiaries may\nbe requested to provide information or\notherwise cooperate with government\nauthorities in the conduct of investigations\nof other persons or industry groups. Although\nthere can be no assurance as to the ultimate\noutcome, Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries\nhave generally denied, or believe we have a\nmeritorious defense and will deny, liability\nin all significant legal actions pending\nagainst us, including the matters described\nbelow, and we intend to defend vigorously each\ncase, other than matters we describe as having\nsettled. We establish accruals for legal\nactions when potential losses associated with\nthe actions become probable and the costs can\nbe reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we\nrecord the amount we consider to be the best\nestimate within a range of potential losses\nthat are both probable and estimable; however,\nif we cannot determine a best estimate, then\nwe record the low end of the range of those\npotential losses. The actual costs of\nresolving legal actions may be substantially\nhigher or lower than the amounts accrued for\nthose actions. ATM ACCESS FEE LITIGATION In\nOctober 2011, plaintiffs filed a putative\nclass action, Mackmin, et al. v. Visa, Inc. et\nal. , against Wells Fargo & Company, Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A., Visa, MasterCard, and\nseveral other banks in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia.\nPlaintiffs allege that the Visa and MasterCard\nrequirement that if an ATM operator charges an\naccess fee on Visa and MasterCard\ntransactions, then that fee cannot be greater\nthan the access fee charged for transactions\non other networks, violates antitrust rules.\nPlaintiffs seek treble damages, restitution,\ninjunctive relief, and attorneys\u2019 fees where\navailable under federal and state law. Two\nother antitrust cases that make similar\nallegations were filed in the same court, but\nthese cases did not name Wells Fargo as a\ndefendant. On February 13, 2013, the district\ncourt granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss\nthe threeactions. Plaintiffs appealed the\ndismissals and, on August 4, 2015, the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia Circuit vacated the district court\u2019s\ndecisions and remanded the threecases to the\ndistrict court for further proceedings. On\nJune 28, 2016, the United States Supreme Court\ngranted defendants\u2019 petitions for writ of\ncertiorari to review the decisions of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the\nDistrict of Columbia. On November 17, 2016,\nthe United States Supreme Court dismissed the\npetitions as improvidently granted, and the\nthreecases returned to the district court for\nfurther proceedings. The Company has entered\ninto an agreement pursuant to which the\nCompany will pay $ 20.8million to resolve the\ncases, subject to court approval. AUTOMOBILE\nLENDING MATTERS On April 20, 2018, the Company\nentered into consent orders with the Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to\nresolve, among other things, investigations by\nthe agencies into the Company\u2019s compliance\nrisk management program and its past practices\ninvolving certain automobile collateral\nprotection insurance (CPI) policies and\ncertain mortgage interest rate lock\nextensions. The consent orders require\nremediation to customers and the payment of a\ntotal of $ 1.0billion in civil money penalties\nto the agencies. In July 2017, the Company\nannounced a plan to remediate customers who\nmay have been financially harmed due to issues\nrelated to automobile CPI policies purchased\nthrough a third-party vendor on their behalf.\nMultiple putative class action cases alleging,\namong other things, unfair and deceptive\npractices relating to these CPI policies, have\nbeen filed against the Company and\nconsolidated into onemulti-district litigation\nin the United States District Court for the\nCentral District of California. The Company\nhas reached an agreement to resolve the multi-\ndistrict litigation pursuant to which the\nCompany has agreed to pay, consistent with its\nremediation obligations under the consent\norders, approximately $ 643million in\nremediation to customers with CPI policies\nplaced between October 15, 2005, and September\n30, 2016. The settlement amount is not\nincremental to the Company\u2019s remediation\nobligations under the consent orders, but\ninstead encompasses those obligations,\nincluding remediation payments to date. The\nsettlement amount is subject to change as the\nCompany finalizes its remediation activity\nunder the consent orders. In addition, the\nCompany has agreed to contribute $ 1million to\na common fund for the class. The district\ncourt granted final approval of the settlement\non November 21, 2019. A putative class of\nshareholders also filed a securities fraud\nclass action against the Company and its\nexecutive officers alleging material\nmisstatements and omissions of CPI-related\ninformation in the Company\u2019s public\ndisclosures. In January 2020, the court\ndismissed this action as to all defendants\nexcept the Company and a former executive\nofficer and limited the action to two alleged\nmisstatements. In addition, the Company is\nsubject to a class action lawsuit in the\nUnited States District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California alleging that customers\nare entitled to refunds related to the unused\nportion of guaranteed automobile protection\n(GAP) waiver or insurance agreements between\nthe customer and dealer and, by assignment,\nthe lender. Allegations related to the CPI and\nGAP programs are among the subjects of\nshareholder derivative lawsuits pending in\nfederal and state court in California. The\ncourt dismissed the state court action in\nSeptember 2018, but plaintiffs filed an\namended complaint in November 2018. The\nparties to the state court action have entered\ninto an agreement to resolve the action\npursuant to which the Company will pay\nplaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and undertake\ncertain business and governance practices. The\nstate court granted final approval of the\nsettlement on January 15, 2020, and a notice\nof appeal has been filed. These and other\nissues related to the origination, servicing,\nand collection of consumer automobile loans,\nincluding related insurance products, have\nalso subjected the Company to formal or\ninformal inquiries, investigations, or\nexaminations from federal and state government\nagencies. In December 2018, the Company\nentered into an agreement with all 50 state\nAttorneys General and the District of Columbia\nto resolve an investigation into the Company\u2019s\nretail sales practices, CPI and GAP, and\nmortgage interest rate lock matters, pursuant\nto which the Company paid $ 575million.\nCONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION Wells\nFargo shareholders have brought a securities\nfraud class action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of\nNew\n124\n\nYork alleging that the Company and certain of\nits current and former executive officers made\nfalse or misleading statements regarding the\nCompany\u2019s efforts to comply with the February\n2018 consent order with the Federal Reserve\nBoard and the April 2018 consent orders with\nthe CFPB and OCC. CONSUMER DEPOSIT ACCOUNT\nRELATED REGULATORY INVESTIGATION The CFPB is\nconducting an investigation into whether\ncustomers were unduly harmed by the Company\u2019s\nhistorical practices associated with the\nfreezing (and, in many cases, closing) of\nconsumer deposit accounts after the Company\ndetected suspected fraudulent activity (by\nthird parties or account holders) that\naffected those accounts. CORONAVIRUS AID,\nRELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT/PAYCHECK\nPROTECTION PROGRAM Plaintiffs have filed\nputative class actions in various federal\ncourts against the Company. The actions seek\ndamages and injunctive relief related to the\nCompany\u2019s offering of Paycheck Protection\nProgram (PPP) loans under the Coronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic Security Act, as well as\nclaims for fees by purported agents who\nallegedly assisted customers with preparing\nPPP loan applications submitted to the\nCompany. The Company has also received formal\nand informal inquiries from federal and state\ngovernmental agencies regarding its offering\nof PPP loans. In addition, Wells Fargo\nshareholders have brought a securities fraud\nclass action in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of California\nalleging that the Company and certain of its\nexecutive officers made false or misleading\nstatements regarding the Company's\nparticipation in the PPP and the Company's\ncompliance with related regulations. FIDUCIARY\nAND CUSTODY ACCOUNT FEE CALCULATIONS Federal\ngovernment agencies are conducting formal or\ninformal inquiries, investigations, or\nexaminations regarding fee calculations within\ncertain fiduciary and custody accounts in the\nCompany\u2019s investment and fiduciary services\nbusiness, which is part of the wealth\nmanagement business within the Wealth and\nInvestment Management (WIM) operating segment.\nThe Company has determined that there have\nbeen instances of incorrect fees being applied\nto certain assets and accounts, resulting in\nboth overcharges and undercharges to\ncustomers. FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUSINESS The\nUnited States Department of Justice\n(Department of Justice) is investigating\ncertain activities in the Company\u2019s foreign\nexchange business, including whether customers\nmay have received pricing inconsistent with\ncommitments made to those customers. Previous\ninvestigations by other federal government\nagencies have been resolved. INTERCHANGE\nLITIGATION Plaintiffs representing a putative\nclass of merchants have filed putative class\nactions, and individual merchants have filed\nindividual actions, against Wells Fargo Bank,\nN.A., Wells Fargo & Company, Wachovia Bank,\nN.A., and Wachovia Corporation regarding the\ninterchange fees associated with Visa and\nMasterCard payment card transactions. Visa,\nMasterCard, and several other banks and bank\nholding companies are also named as defendants\nin these actions. These actions have been\nconsolidated in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of New York.\nThe amended and consolidated complaint asserts\nclaims against defendants based on alleged\nviolations of federal and state antitrust laws\nand seeks damages, as well as injunctive\nrelief. Plaintiff merchants allege that Visa,\nMasterCard, and payment card issuing banks\nunlawfully colluded to set interchange rates.\nPlaintiffs also allege that enforcement of\ncertain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged\ntying and bundling of services offered to\nmerchants are anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and\nWachovia, along with other defendants and\nentities, are parties to Loss and Judgment\nSharing Agreements, which provide that they,\nalong with other entities, will share, based\non a formula, in any losses from the\nInterchange Litigation. On July 13, 2012,\nVisa, MasterCard, and the financial\ninstitution defendants, including Wells Fargo,\nsigned a memorandum of understanding with\nplaintiff merchants to resolve the\nconsolidated class action and reached a\nseparate settlement in principle of the\nconsolidated individual actions. The\nsettlement payments to be made by all\ndefendants in the consolidated class and\nindividual actions totaled approximately $\n6.6billion before reductions applicable to\ncertain merchants opting out of the\nsettlement. The class settlement also provided\nfor the distribution to class merchants of 10\nbasis points of default interchange across all\ncredit rate categories for a period of eight\nconsecutive months. The district court granted\nfinal approval of the settlement, which was\nappealed to the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit by settlement objector\nmerchants. Other merchants opted out of the\nsettlement and are pursuing several individual\nactions. On June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit\nvacated the settlement agreement and reversed\nand remanded the consolidated action to the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York for further proceedings.\nOn November 23, 2016, prior class counsel\nfiled a petition to the United States Supreme\nCourt, seeking review of the reversal of the\nsettlement by the Second Circuit, and the\nSupreme Court denied the petition on March 27,\n2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court\nappointed lead class counsel for a damages\nclass and an equitable relief class. The\nparties have entered into a settlement\nagreement to resolve the money damages class\nclaims pursuant to which defendants will pay a\ntotal of approximately $ 6.2billion, which\nincludes approximately $ 5.3billion of funds\nremaining from the 2012 settlement and $\n900million in additional funding. The\nCompany\u2019s allocated responsibility for the\nadditional funding is approximately $\n94.5million. The court granted final approval\nof the settlement on December 13, 2019, which\nwas appealed to the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit by settlement\nobjector merchants. Several of the opt-out and\ndirect action litigations have been settled\nwhile others remain pending. Discovery is\nproceeding in the opt-out litigations and the\nequitable relief class case. LOW INCOME\nHOUSING TAX CREDITS Federal government\nagencies have undertaken formal or informal\ninquiries or investigations regarding the\nmanner in which the Company purchased, and\nnegotiated the purchase of, certain federal\nlow income housing tax credits in connection\nwith the financing of low income housing\ndevelopments. MOBILE DEPOSIT PATENT LITIGATION\nThe Company is a defendant in twoseparate\ncases brought by United Services Automobile\nAssociation (USAA) in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of\nTexas alleging claims of patent infringement\nregarding mobile deposit capture technology\npatents held by USAA. Trial in the first case\ncommenced on October 30, 2019, and resulted in\na $ 200million verdict against the Company.\nTrial in the second case commenced on January\n6, 2020, and resulted in a $ 102.7million\nverdict against the Company. The Company has\nfiled post-trial motions to, among other\nthings, vacate the verdicts, and USAA has\nfiled post-trial motions seeking future\nroyalty payments and damages for willful\ninfringement.\n                                           125\n                                              \n  Note 14:  Legal Actions (continued)         \n                                              \nMORTGAGE LOAN MODIFICATION LITIGATION\nPlaintiffs representing a putative class of\nmortgage borrowers have filed separate\nputative class actions, Hernandez v. Wells\nFargo, et al. , Coordes v. Wells Fargo, et al.\n, Ryder v. Wells Fargo , Liguori v. Wells\nFargo , and Dore v. Wells Fargo , against\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A., in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, the United States District Court\nfor the District of Washington, the United\nStates District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Ohio, the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York,\nand the United States District Court for the\nWestern District of Pennsylvania,\nrespectively. Plaintiffs allege that Wells\nFargo improperly denied mortgage loan\nmodifications or repayment plans to customers\nin the foreclosure process due to the\noverstatement of foreclosure attorneys\u2019 fees\nthat were included for purposes of determining\nwhether a customer in the foreclosure process\nqualified for a mortgage loan modification or\nrepayment plan. The district court in the\nHernandez case certified a nationwide breach\nof contract class for foreclosed borrowers and\ndenied certification on claims pertaining to\nother impacted borrowers. In March 2020, the\nCompany entered into an agreement pursuant to\nwhich the Company will pay $ 18.5million to\nresolve the claims of the certified class in\nthe Hernandez case, which was approved by the\ndistrict court in October 2020. The plaintiffs\nand the Company have informed the district\ncourt that they will move to reopen the\nHernandez settlement to include additional\nborrowers who the Company determined should\nhave been included in the settlement class\nonce the total number of additional borrowers\nhas been confirmed. The Company has identified\na population of additional borrowers during\nthe relevant class period whose loans had not\npreviously been reviewed for inclusion in the\noriginal population of impacted customers. The\nidentification of these additional borrowers\nmay also increase the potential class of\nmortgage borrowers in the other pending\nmatters. MORTGAGE-RELATED REGULATORY\nINVESTIGATIONS Federal and state government\nagencies, including the Department of Justice,\nhave been investigating or examining certain\nmortgage related activities of Wells Fargo and\npredecessor institutions. Wells Fargo, for\nitself and for predecessor institutions, has\nresponded to requests from these agencies\nseeking information regarding the origination,\nunderwriting, and securitization of\nresidential mortgages, including sub-prime\nmortgages. These agencies have advanced\ntheories of purported liability with respect\nto certain of these activities. An agreement,\npursuant to which the Company paid $\n2.09billion, was reached in August 2018 to\nresolve the Department of Justice\ninvestigation, which related to certain\n2005-2007 residential mortgage-backed\nsecurities activities. In addition, the\nCompany reached an agreement with the Attorney\nGeneral of the State of Illinois in November\n2018 pursuant to which the Company paid $\n17million in restitution to certain Illinois\nstate pension funds and reached an agreement\nwith the Attorney General of the State of\nMaryland in June 2020 pursuant to which the\nCompany agreed to pay $ 20million in\nrestitution, in each case to resolve claims\nrelating to certain residential mortgage-\nbacked securities activities. Other financial\ninstitutions have entered into similar\nsettlements with these agencies, the nature of\nwhich related to the specific activities of\nthose financial institutions, including the\nimposition of significant financial penalties\nand remedial actions. NOMURA/NATIXIS MORTGAGE-\nRELATED LITIGATION In August 2014 and August\n2015, Nomura Credit & Capital Inc. (Nomura)\nand Natixis Real Estate Holdings, LLC\n(Natixis) filed a total of seventhird-party\ncomplaints against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in\nNew York state court. In the underlying first-\nparty actions, Nomura and Natixis have been\nsued for alleged breaches of representations\nand warranties made in connection with\nresidential mortgage-backed securities\nsponsored by them. In the third-party actions,\nNomura and Natixis allege that Wells Fargo, as\nmaster servicer, primary servicer or\nsecurities administrator, failed to notify\nNomura and Natixis of their own breaches,\nfailed to properly oversee the primary\nservicers, and failed to adhere to accepted\nservicing practices. Natixis additionally\nalleges that Wells Fargo failed to perform\ndefault oversight duties. Wells Fargo has\nasserted counterclaims alleging that Nomura\nand Natixis failed to provide Wells Fargo\nnotice of their representation and warranty\nbreaches. OFAC RELATED INVESTIGATION The\nCompany has self-identified an issue whereby\ncertain foreign banks utilized a Wells Fargo\nsoftware-based solution to conduct\nimport/export trade-related financing\ntransactions with countries and entities\nprohibited by the Office of Foreign Assets\nControl (OFAC) of the United States Department\nof the Treasury. We do not believe any funds\nrelated to these transactions flowed through\naccounts at Wells Fargo as a result of the\naforementioned conduct. The Company has made\nvoluntary self-disclosures to OFAC and is\ncooperating with an inquiry from the\nDepartment of Justice. ORDER OF POSTING\nLITIGATION Plaintiffs filed a series of\nputative class actions against Wachovia Bank,\nN.A., and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as well as\nmany other banks, challenging the \u201chigh to\nlow\u201d order in which the banks post debit card\ntransactions to consumer deposit accounts.\nMost of these actions were consolidated in\nmulti-district litigation proceedings (MDL\nproceedings) in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of Florida.\nThe court in the MDL proceedings has certified\na class of putative plaintiffs, and Wells\nFargo moved to compel arbitration of the\nclaims of unnamed class members. The court\ndenied the motions to compel arbitration in\nOctober 2016, and Wells Fargo appealed this\ndecision to the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Eleventh Circuit. In May 2018, the\nEleventh Circuit ruled in Wells Fargo\u2019s favor\nand found that Wells Fargo had not waived its\narbitration rights and remanded the case to\nthe district court for further proceedings. On\nSeptember 26, 2019, the district court entered\nan order granting Wells Fargo\u2019s motion and\ndismissed the claims of unnamed class members\nin favor of arbitration. Plaintiffs appealed\nthis decision to the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit. RETAIL SALES\nPRACTICES MATTERS A number of bodies or\nentities, including (a) federal, state, and\nlocal government agencies, including the\nDepartment of Justice, the United States\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and\nthe United States Department of Labor, (b)\nstate attorneys general, including the New\nYork Attorney General, and (c) Congressional\ncommittees, have undertaken formal or informal\ninquiries, investigations, or examinations\narising out of certain retail sales practices\nof the Company that were the subject of\nsettlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the\nOffice of the Los Angeles City Attorney\nannounced by the Company on September 8, 2016.\nThese matters are at varying stages. The\nCompany has responded, and continues to\nrespond, to requests from certain of the\nforegoing. In October 2018, the Company\nentered into an agreement to resolve the New\nYork Attorney General\u2019s investigation pursuant\nto which the Company paid $ 65million to the\nState of New York. In December 2018, the\nCompany entered into an agreement with all 50\nstate Attorneys General and the District of\nColumbia to resolve an investigation into the\nCompany\u2019s retail sales\n\n126\n\npractices, CPI and GAP, and mortgage interest\nrate lock matters, pursuant to which the\nCompany paid $ 575million. On February 21,\n2020, the Company entered into an agreement\nwith the Department of Justice to resolve the\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s criminal investigation\ninto the Company\u2019s retail sales practices, as\nwell as a separate agreement to resolve the\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s civil investigation.\nAs part of the Department of Justice criminal\nsettlement, no charges will be filed against\nthe Company provided the Company abides by all\nthe terms of the agreement. The Department of\nJustice criminal settlement also includes the\nCompany\u2019s agreement that the facts set forth\nin the settlement document constitute\nsufficient facts for the finding of criminal\nviolations of statutes regarding bank records\nand personal information.On February 21, 2020,\nthe Company also entered into an order to\nresolve the SEC\u2019s investigation arising out of\nthe Company\u2019s retail sales practices. The SEC\norder contains a finding, to which the Company\nconsented, that the facts set forth include\nviolations of Section 10(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\nthereunder.As part of the resolution of the\nDepartment of Justice and SEC investigations,\nthe Company has agreed to make payments\ntotaling $ 3.0billion. In addition, as part of\nthe settlements and included in the $\n3.0billion amount, the Company has agreed to\nthe creation of a $ 500million Fair Fund for\nthe benefit of investors who were harmed by\nthe conduct covered in the SEC settlement. In\naddition, a number of lawsuits have been filed\nby non-governmental parties seeking damages or\nother remedies related to these retail sales\npractices. First, various class plaintiffs,\npurporting to represent consumers who allege\nthat they received products or services\nwithout their authorization or consent, have\nbrought separate putative class actions\nagainst the Company in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia and various other jurisdictions. On\nJune 14, 2018, the district court granted\nfinal approval of a settlement entered into by\nthe Company in the first-filed action, Jabbari\nv. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A ., pursuant to which\nthe Company will pay $ 142million to resolve\nclaims regarding certain products or services\nprovided without authorization or consent for\nthe time period May 1, 2002 to April 20, 2017.\nOn July 20, 2020, the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the\ndistrict court's order granting final approval\nof the settlement. On September 29, 2020, the\ndistrict court approved the settlement\ndistribution to the Jabbari claimants. Second,\nthe Company was subject to a consolidated\nsecurities fraud class action alleging certain\nmisstatements and omissions in the Company\u2019s\ndisclosures related to sales practices\nmatters. The Company entered into a settlement\nagreement to resolve this matter pursuant to\nwhich the Company paid $ 480million. Third,\nWells Fargo shareholders have brought numerous\nshareholder derivative lawsuits asserting\nbreach of fiduciary duty claims against, among\nothers, current and former directors and\nofficers for their alleged involvement with\nand failure to detect and prevent sales\npractices issues. These actions are currently\npending in the United States District Court\nfor the Northern District of California and\nCalifornia state court as consolidated or\ncoordinated proceedings. The parties have\nentered into settlement agreements to resolve\nthe shareholder derivative lawsuits pursuant\nto which insurance carriers will pay the\nCompany approximately $ 240million for alleged\ndamage to the Company, and the Company will\npay plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees. The federal\ncourt granted final approval of the settlement\nfor its action on April 7, 2020. The state\ncourt granted final approval of the settlement\nfor its action on January 15, 2020. Fourth, a\npurported Employee Retirement Income Security\nAct (ERISA) class action was filed in the\nUnited States District Court for the District\nof Minnesota on behalf of 401(k) plan\nparticipants. The district court dismissed the\naction, and on July 27, 2020, the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\naffirmed the dismissal. RMBS TRUSTEE\nLITIGATION In November 2014, a group of\ninstitutional investors (Institutional\nInvestor Plaintiffs), including funds\naffiliated with BlackRock, Inc., filed a\nputative class action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of\nNew York against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,\nalleging claims against the Company in its\ncapacity as trustee for a number of\nresidential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS)\ntrusts (Federal Court Complaint). Similar\ncomplaints have been filed against other\ntrustees in various courts, including in the\nSouthern District of New York, in New York\nstate court, and in other states, by RMBS\ninvestors. The Federal Court Complaint alleged\nthat Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee,\ncaused losses to investors and asserted causes\nof action based upon, among other things, the\ntrustee\u2019s alleged failure to notify and\nenforce repurchase obligations of mortgage\nloan sellers for purported breaches of\nrepresentations and warranties, notify\ninvestors of alleged events of default, and\nabide by appropriate standards of care\nfollowing alleged events of default.\nPlaintiffs sought money damages in an\nunspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses,\nand equitable relief. In December 2014 and\nDecember 2015, certain other investors filed\nadditional complaints alleging similar claims\nagainst Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in the\nSouthern District of New York (Related Federal\nCases). In January 2016, the Southern District\nof New York entered an order in connection\nwith the Federal Court Complaint dismissing\nclaims related to certain of the trusts at\nissue (Dismissed Trusts). The Company\u2019s\nsubsequent motion to dismiss the Federal Court\nComplaint and the complaints for the Related\nFederal Cases was granted in part and denied\nin part in March 2017. In May 2017, the\nCompany filed third-party complaints against\ncertain investment advisors affiliated with\nthe Institutional Investor Plaintiffs seeking\ncontribution with respect to claims alleged in\nthe Federal Court Complaint (Third-Party\nClaims). In December 2016, the Institutional\nInvestor Plaintiffs filed a new putative class\naction complaint in New York state court in\nrespect of 261RMBS trusts, including the\nDismissed Trusts, for which Wells Fargo Bank,\nN.A., serves or served as trustee (State Court\nAction). A complaint raising similar\nallegations to those in the Federal Court\nComplaint was filed in May 2016 in New York\nstate court by IKB International and IKB\nDeutsche Industriebank (IKB Action). In July\n2017, certain of the plaintiffs from the State\nCourt Action filed a civil complaint relating\nto Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\u2019s setting aside\nreserves for legal fees and expenses in\nconnection with the liquidation of elevenRMBS\ntrusts at issue in the State Court Action\n(Declaratory Judgment Action). The complaint\nsought, among other relief, declarations that\nthe Company is not entitled to\nindemnification, the advancement of funds, or\nthe taking of reserves from trust funds for\nlegal fees and expenses it incurs in defending\nthe claims in the State Court Action. In May\n2019, the New York state court approved a\nsettlement agreement among the Institutional\nInvestor Plaintiffs and the Company pursuant\nto which, among other terms, the Company paid\n$ 43million to resolve the Federal Court\nComplaint and the State Court Action. The\nsettlement also resolved the Third Party\nClaims and the Declaratory Judgment Action.\nThe settlement did not affect the Related\nFederal Cases or the IKB Action, which remain\npending.\n                                           127\n                                              \n  Note 14:  Legal Actions (continued)         \n                                              \nSEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION The Seminole\nTribe of Florida filed a complaint in Florida\nstate court alleging that Wells Fargo, as\ntrustee, charged excess fees in connection\nwith the administration of a minor\u2019s trust and\nfailed to invest the assets of the trust\nprudently. The complaint was later amended to\ninclude threeindividual current and former\nbeneficiaries as plaintiffs and to remove the\nTribe as a party to the case. In December\n2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss\nthe amended complaint on the grounds that the\nTribe is a necessary party and that the\nindividual beneficiaries lack standing to\nbring claims. The motion was denied in June\n2018. The case is pending trial. WHOLESALE\nBANKING CONSENT ORDER INVESTIGATION On\nNovember 19, 2015, the Company entered into a\nconsent order with the OCC, pursuant to which\nthe Wholesale Banking group was required to\nimplement customer due diligence standards\nthat include collection of current beneficial\nownership information for certain business\ncustomers. The Company is responding to\ninquiries from various federal government\nagencies regarding potentially inappropriate\nconduct in connection with the collection of\nbeneficial ownership information. OUTLOOK As\ndescribed above, the Company establishes\naccruals for legal actions when potential\nlosses associated with the actions become\nprobable and the costs can be reasonably\nestimated. The high end of the range of\nreasonably possible potential losses in excess\nof the Company\u2019s accrual for probable and\nestimable losses was approximately $\n2.4billion as of September 30, 2020. The\noutcomes of legal actions are unpredictable\nand subject to significant uncertainties, and\nit is inherently difficult to determine\nwhether any loss is probable or even possible.\nIt is also inherently difficult to estimate\nthe amount of any loss and there may be\nmatters for which a loss is probable or\nreasonably possible but not currently\nestimable. Accordingly, actual losses may be\nin excess of the established accrual or the\nrange of reasonably possible loss. Wells Fargo\nis unable to determine whether the ultimate\nresolution of the retail sales practices\nmatters will have a material adverse effect on\nits consolidated financial condition. Based on\ninformation currently available, advice of\ncounsel, available insurance coverage, and\nestablished reserves, Wells Fargo believes\nthat the eventual outcome of other actions\nagainst Wells Fargo and/or its subsidiaries\nwill not, individually or in the aggregate,\nhave a material adverse effect on Wells\nFargo\u2019s consolidated financial condition.\nHowever, it is possible that the ultimate\nresolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be\nmaterial to Wells Fargo\u2019s results of\noperations for any particular period.\n\n128\n                         \n  Note 15:  Derivatives  \n                         \nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to\nmarket risk, including interest rate risk,\ncredit risk and foreign currency risk, and to\nassist customers with their risk management\nobjectives. We designate certain derivatives\nas hedging instruments in qualifying hedge\naccounting relationships (fair value or cash\nflow hedges).

We execute substantially\nall of our derivative transactions under\nmaster netting arrangements and reflect all\nderivative balances and related cash\ncollateral subject to enforceable master\nnetting arrangements on a net basis within the\nbalance sheet. The \u201cGross amounts recognized\u201d\ncolumn in the following table includes $\n55.9billion and $ 48.6billion of gross\nderivative assets and liabilities,\nrespectively, at September 30, 2020, and $\n33.7billion and $ 33.5billion, respectively,\nat December 31, 2019, with counterparties\nsubject to enforceable master netting\narrangements that are eligible for balance\nsheet netting adjustments. The majority of\nthese amounts are interest rate contracts\nexecuted in over-the-counter (OTC) markets.\nThe remaining gross derivative assets and\nliabilities of $ 9.1billion and $ 7.1billion,\nrespectively, at September 30, 2020, and $\n5.6billion and $ 4.4billion, respectively, at\nDecember 31, 2019, include those with\ncounterparties subject to master netting\narrangements for which we have not assessed\nthe enforceability because they are with\ncounterparties where we do not currently have\npositions to offset, those subject to master\nnetting arrangements where we have not been\nable to confirm the enforceability and those\nnot subject to master netting arrangements. As\nsuch, we do not net derivative balances or\ncollateral within the balance sheet for these\ncounterparties. Cash collateral receivables\nand payables that have not been offset against\nour derivatives were $ 3.6billion and $\n605million, respectively, at September 30,\n2020, and $ 6.3billion and $ 1.4billion,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2019. We\ndetermine the balance sheet netting\nadjustments based on the terms specified\nwithin each master netting arrangement. We\ndisclose the balance sheet netting amounts\nwithin the column titled \u201cGross amounts offset\nin consolidated balance sheet.\u201d Balance sheet\nnetting adjustments are determined at the\ncounterparty level for which there may be\nmultiple contract types. For disclosure\npurposes, we allocate these netting\nadjustments to the contract type for each\ncounterparty proportionally based upon the\n\u201cGross amounts recognized\u201d by counterparty. As\na result, the net amounts disclosed by\ncontract type may not represent the actual\nexposure upon settlement of the contracts. We\ndo not net non-cash collateral that we receive\nand pledge on the balance sheet. For\ndisclosure purposes, we present the fair value\nof this non-cash collateral in the column\ntitled \u201cGross amounts not offset in\nconsolidated balance sheet (Disclosure-only\nnetting)\u201d within the table. We determine and\nallocate the Disclosure-only netting amounts\nin the same manner as balance sheet netting\namounts. The \u201cNet amounts\u201d column within Table\n15.2 represents the aggregate of our net\nexposure to each counterparty after\nconsidering the balance sheet and Disclosure-\nonly netting adjustments. We manage derivative\nexposure by monitoring the credit risk\nassociated with each counterparty using\ncounterparty specific credit risk limits,\nusing master netting arrangements and\nobtaining collateral. Derivative contracts\nexecuted in OTC markets include bilateral\ncontractual arrangements that are not cleared\nthrough a central clearing organization but\nare typically subject to master netting\narrangements. The proportion of these\nderivative contracts relative to our total\nderivative assets and liabilities are\npresented in the \u201cPercent exchanged in over-\nthe-counter market\u201d column in Table 15.2. In\naddition to the netting amounts included in\nthe table, we also have balance sheet netting\nrelated to resale and repurchase agreements\nthat are disclosed within Note 13 (Guarantees,\nPledged Assets and Collateral, and Other\nCommitments).\n\n130\n\nTable 15.2: Gross Fair Values of Derivative\nAssets and Liabilities\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      3      \u2014      3      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      8      \u2026      3      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n                                              \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      3      \u2014      3      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      5      \u2026      2      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n                                              \n(1) Represents amounts with counterparties\nsubject to enforceable master netting\narrangements that have been offset in the\nconsolidated balance sheet, including related\ncash collateral and portfolio level\ncounterparty valuation adjustments.\nCounterparty valuation adjustments related to\nderivative assets were $ 507million and $\n231million and debit valuation adjustments\nrelated to derivative liabilities were $\n236million and $ 100million at September 30,\n2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nCash collateral totaled $ 6.4billion and $\n7.3billion, netted against derivative assets\nand liabilities, respectively, at September\n30, 2020, and $ 2.9billion and $ 6.8billion,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2019.\n\nFair Value and Cash Flow Hedges For fair value\nhedges, we use interest rate swaps to convert\ncertain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and\ntime certificates of deposit to floating rates\nto hedge our exposure to interest rate risk.\nWe also enter into cross-currency swaps,\ncross-currency interest rate swaps and forward\ncontracts to hedge our exposure to foreign\ncurrency risk and interest rate risk\nassociated with the issuance of non-U.S.\ndollar denominated long-term debt. In\naddition, we use interest rate swaps, cross-\ncurrency swaps, cross-currency interest rate\nswaps and forward contracts to hedge against\nchanges in fair value of certain investments\nin available-for-sale debt securities due to\nchanges in interest rates, foreign currency\nrates, or both. We also use interest rate\nswaps to hedge against changes in fair value\nfor certain mortgage loans held for sale. For\ncertain fair value hedges of foreign currency\nrisk, changes in fair value of cross-currency\nswaps attributable to changes in cross-\ncurrency basis spreads are excluded from the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded\nin other comprehensive income. See Note 21\n(Other Comprehensive Income) for the amounts\nrecognized in other comprehensive income. For\ncash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps\nto hedge the variability in interest payments\nreceived on certain floating-rate commercial\nloans and paid on certain floating-rate debt\ndue to changes in the contractually specified\ninterest rate. We also use cross-currency\nswaps to hedge variability in interest\npayments on fixed-rate foreign currency-\ndenominated long-term debt due to changes in\nforeign exchange rates. We estimate $\n175million pre-tax of deferred net losses\nrelated to cash flow hedges in OCI at\nSeptember 30, 2020, will be reclassified into\nnet interest income during the next twelve\nmonths. The deferred losses expected to be\nreclassified into net interest income are\npredominantly related to discontinued hedges\nof floating rate loans.

We use credit\nderivatives to assist customers with their\nrisk management objectives. We may also use\ncredit derivatives in structured product\ntransactions or liquidity agreements written\nto special purpose vehicles. The maximum\nexposure of sold credit derivatives is managed\nthrough posted collateral, purchased credit\nderivatives and similar products in order to\nachieve our desired credit risk profile. This\ncredit risk management provides an ability to\nrecover a significant portion of any amounts\nthat would be paid under the sold credit\nderivatives. We would be required to perform\nunder sold credit derivatives in the event of\ndefault by the referenced obligors. Events of\ndefault include events such as bankruptcy,\ncapital restructuring or lack of principal\nand/or interest payment. In certain cases,\nother triggers may exist, such as the credit\ndowngrade of the referenced obligors or the\ninability of the special purpose vehicle for\nwhich we have provided liquidity to obtain\nfunding.

Assets and liabilities recorded\nat fair value on a recurring basis are\npresented in Table 16.2 in this Note. From\ntime to time, we may be required to record\nfair value adjustments on a nonrecurring\nbasis. These nonrecurring fair value\nadjustments typically involve application of\nLOCOM accounting, write-downs of individual\nassets or application of the measurement\nalternative for nonmarketable equity\nsecurities. Assets recorded on a nonrecurring\nbasis are presented in Table 16.13 in this\nNote. Table 16.19 includes estimates of fair\nvalue for financial instruments that are not\nrecorded at fair value. See Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) in our 2019\nForm 10-K for discussion of how we determine\nfair value. For descriptions of the valuation\nmethodologies we use for assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair value on a\nrecurring or nonrecurring basis and for\nestimating fair value for financial\ninstruments that are not recorded at fair\nvalue, see Note 19 (Fair Values of Assets and\nLiabilities) in our 2019 Form 10-K. FAIR VALUE\nHIERARCHY We classify our assets and\nliabilities measured at fair value as either\nLevel 1, Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value\nhierarchy. The highest priority (Level 1) is\nassigned to valuations based on unadjusted\nquoted prices in active markets and the lowest\npriority (Level 3) is assigned to valuations\nbased on significant unobservable inputs. See\nNote 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies) in our 2019 Form 10-K for a detailed\ndescription of the fair value hierarchy. In\nthe determination of the classification of\nfinancial instruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy, we consider all\navailable information, including observable\nmarket data, indications of market liquidity\nand orderliness, and our understanding of the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs\nused. For securities in inactive markets, we\nuse a predetermined percentage to evaluate the\nimpact of fair value adjustments derived from\nweighting both external and internal\nindications of value to determine if the\ninstrument is classified as Level 2 or Level\n3. Otherwise, the classification of Level 2 or\nLevel 3 is based upon the specific facts and\ncircumstances of each instrument or instrument\ncategory and judgments are made regarding the\nsignificance of the Level 3 inputs to the\ninstruments\u2019 fair value measurement in its\nentirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered\nsignificant, the instrument is classified as\nLevel 3. We do not classify equity securities\nin the fair value hierarchy if we use the non-\npublished net asset value (NAV) per share (or\nits equivalent) that has been communicated to\nus as an investor as a practical expedient to\nmeasure fair value. We generally use NAV per\nshare as the fair value measurement for\ncertain nonmarketable equity fund investments.\nMarketable equity securities with published\nNAVs are classified in the fair value\nhierarchy. Fair Value Measurements from\nVendors For certain assets and liabilities, we\nobtain fair value measurements from vendors\nand we record the fair value in our financial\nstatements. For additional information, see\nNote 19 (Fair Values of Assets and\nLiabilities) in our 2019 Form 10-K. Table 16.1\npresents fair value measurements obtained from\nthird-party pricing services classified within\nthe fair value hierarchy. Fair value\nmeasurements obtained from brokers and fair\nvalue measurements obtained from third-party\npricing services that we have adjusted using\ninternal models or non-vendor data to\ndetermine the fair value are excluded from\nTable 16.1. The unadjusted fair value\nmeasurements obtained from brokers for\navailable-for-sale debt securities were $\n19million in Level 2 assets and $ 124million\nin Level 3 assets at September 30, 2020, and $\n45million and $ 126million at December 31,\n2019, respectively.\nTable 16.1: Fair Value Measurements obtained\nfrom Third-Party Pricing Services\n                                              \n

provide\nquantitative information about the valuation\ntechniques and significant unobservable inputs\nused in the valuation of substantially all of\nour Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at\nfair value on a recurring basis for which we\nuse an internal model. The significant\nunobservable inputs for Level 3 assets and\nliabilities inherent in the fair values\nobtained from third-party vendors are not\nincluded in the table, as the specific inputs\napplied are not provided by the vendor. In\naddition, the table excludes the valuation\ntechniques and significant unobservable inputs\nfor certain classes of Level 3 assets and\nliabilities measured using internal models\nthat we consider, both individually and in the\naggregate, insignificant relative to our\noverall Level 3 assets and liabilities. We\nmade this determination based upon an\nevaluation of each class, which considered the\nmagnitude of the positions, nature of the\nunobservable inputs and potential for\nsignificant changes in fair value due to\nchanges in those inputs. Weighted averages of\ninputs are calculated using outstanding unpaid\nprincipal balance for cash instruments, such\nas loans and securities, and notional amounts\nfor derivative instruments.

The market approach bases\nthe fair value measurement on market data (for\nexample, use of market comparable pricing\ntechniques) that are used to derive the\nenterprise value of the portfolio company.\nMarket comparable pricing techniques include\nutilization of financial metrics of comparable\npublic companies (multiples), such as ratios\nof enterprise value or market value of equity\nto revenue, EBITDA, net income or book value.\nComparable company valuation multiples are\nevaluated and adjusted as necessary to reflect\nthe comparative operational, financial or\nmarketability differences between the public\ncompany and subject portfolio company in\nestimating its fair value. Market comparable\npricing techniques also use recent or\nanticipated transactions (for example, a\nfinancing round, merger, acquisition or\nbankruptcy) involving the subject portfolio\ncompany, or participants in its industry or\nrelated industries. Based upon these recent or\nanticipated transactions, current market\nconditions and other factors specific to the\nissuer, we make adjustments to estimate the\nenterprise value of the portfolio company. As\na result of the recent market environment, we\nalso utilized other valuation techniques.\nThese techniques included the use of company\nrisk factors in the estimation of the fair\nvalue of certain nonmarketable equity\nsecurities. The company risk factors are based\nupon entity-specific considerations including\nthe debt and liquidity profile, projected cash\nflow or funding issues as well as other\nfactors that may affect the company\u2019s outlook.\n\n154\n\nFair Value Option The fair value option is an\nirrevocable election, generally only permitted\nupon initial recognition of financial assets\nor liabilities, to measure eligible financial\ninstruments at fair value with changes in fair\nvalue reflected in earnings. We may elect the\nfair value option to align the measurement\nmodel with how the financial assets or\nliabilities are managed or to reduce\ncomplexity or accounting asymmetry.

Our revenues\nare generally recognized either immediately\nupon the completion of our service or over\ntime as we perform services.

Safe deposit box fees are generally\nrecognized over time as we provide the\nservices. BROKERAGE ADVISORY, COMMISSIONS AND\nOTHER FEES are earned for providing brokerage\nservices and include fees earned on asset-\nbased and transactional accounts and other\nbrokerage advisory services.

The\nremaining revenues include trailing\ncommissions which are earned for selling\nshares to investors. Our obligation associated\nwith earning trailing commissions is satisfied\nat the time shares are sold. However, these\nfees are received and recognized over time\nduring the period the customer owns the shares\nand we remain the broker of record. The amount\nof trailing commissions is variable based on\nthe length of time the customer holds the\nshares and on changes in the value of the\nunderlying assets. Transactional revenues are\nearned for executing transactions at the\nclient\u2019s direction. Our obligation is\ngenerally satisfied upon the execution of the\ntransaction and the fees are based on the size\nand number of transactions executed.\n                                           161\nNote 18: Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n( continued )\n\nOther revenues earned from other brokerage\nadvisory services include omnibus and\nnetworking fees received from mutual fund\ncompanies in return for providing record\nkeeping and other administrative services, and\nannual account maintenance fees charged to\ncustomers.

In addition to AUM, we have\nclient assets under administration (AUA) that\nearn various administrative fees which are\ngenerally based on the extent of the services\nprovided to administer the account.

The Cash Balance Plan was\nfrozen on July 1, 2009, and nonew benefits\nhave accrued after that date. For additional\ninformation on our pension and postretirement\nplans, including plan assumptions, investment\nstrategy and asset allocation, projected\nbenefit payments, and valuation methodologies\nused for assets measured at fair value, see\nNote 23 (Employee Benefits and Other Expenses)\nin our 2019 Form 10-K. We recognize settlement\nlosses for our Cash Balance Plan based on an\nassessment of whether lump sum benefit\npayments will, in aggregate for the year,\nexceed the sum of its annual service and\ninterest cost. Settlement losses of $\n29million and $ 99million were recognized\nduring the third quarter and first nine months\nof 2020, respectively, representing the pro\nrata portion of the net loss in cumulative\nother comprehensive income based on the\npercentage reduction in the Cash Balance\nPlan\u2019s projected benefit obligation\nattributable to lump sum benefit payments\nduring the first nine months of 2020. As a\nresult of the settlement losses, we re-\nmeasured the Cash Balance Plan obligation and\nplan assets as of September 30, 2020, and used\na discount rate of 2.60% based on our\nconsistent methodology of determining our\ndiscount rate using a yield curve with\nmaturity dates that closely match the\nestimated timing of the expected benefit\npayments. The result of the settlement losses\nand re-measurement increased the Cash Balance\nPlan liability by $ 89million and $ 763million\nfor the third quarter and first nine months of\n2020, respectively, and decreased other\ncomprehensive income (pre-tax) by $ 60million\nand $ 664million for the third quarter and\nfirst nine months of 2020, respectively.

The Federal Reserve establishes\ncapital requirements for the consolidated\nfinancial holding company, and the OCC has\nsimilar requirements for the Company\u2019s\nnational banks, including Wells Fargo Bank,\nN.A. (the Bank). Table 23.1 presents\nregulatory capital information for Wells Fargo\n& Company and the Bank in accordance with\nBasel III capital requirements. Our capital\nadequacy is assessed based on the lower of our\nrisk-based capital ratios calculated under the\nStandardized Approach and under the Advanced\nApproach. The Standardized Approach applies\nassigned risk weights to broad risk\ncategories, while the calculation of risk-\nweighted assets (RWAs) under the Advanced\nApproach differs by requiring applicable banks\nto utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which\nrelies upon the use of internal credit models,\nand includes an operational risk component.\nThe Basel III capital requirements for\ncalculating Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) and\ntier 1 capital, along with RWAs, are fully\nphased-in. However, the requirements for\ndetermining tier 2 and total capital are still\nin accordance with Transition Requirements and\nare scheduled to be fully phased-in by the end\nof 2021. Accordingly, the information\npresented below reflects fully phased-in CET1\ncapital, tier 1 capital, and RWAs, but\nreflects total capital still in accordance\nwith Transition Requirements. At September 30,\n2020, the Bank and our other insured\ndepository institutions were considered well-\ncapitalized under the requirements of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act. The Bank is an\napproved seller/servicer of mortgage loans and\nis required to maintain minimum levels of\nshareholders\u2019 equity, as specified by various\nagencies, including the United States\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development,\nGNMA, FHLMC and FNMA. At September 30, 2020,\nthe Bank met these requirements.\nTable 23.1: Regulatory Capital Information (1)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n*Denotes the lowest capital ratio as\ndetermined under the Advanced and Standardized\nApproaches.\n(1) In second quarter 2020, the Company\nelected to apply a modified transition\nprovision issued by federal banking regulators\nrelated to the impact of CECL on regulatory\ncapital. The rule permits certain banking\norganizations to exclude from regulatory\ncapital the initial adoption impact of CECL,\nplus 25% of the cumulative changes in the ACL\nunder CECL for each period until December 31,\n2021, followed by a three-year phase-out of\nthe benefits. The impact of the CECL\ntransition provision on the regulatory capital\nof the Company at September 30, 2020, was an\nincrease in capital of $ 1.9billion,\nreflecting a $ 991million (post-tax) increase\nin capital recognized upon our initial\nadoption of CECL, offset by 25% of the $\n11.5billion increase in our ACL under CECL\nfrom January 1, 2020, through September 30,\n2020. The impact of the CECL transition\nprovision on the regulatory capital of the\nBank at September 30, 2020, was an increase in\ncapital of $ 1.8billion.\n(2) RWAs and capital ratios for December 31,\n2019, have been revised as a result of a\ndecrease in RWAs under the Advanced Approach\ndue to the correction of duplicated\noperational loss amounts.\nRWAs for the Company and the Bank included an\nincrease of $ 1.5billion under the\nStandardized Approach and a decrease of $\n1.3billion under the Advanced Approach related\nto the impact of the CECL transition provision\non the excess allowance for credit losses as\nof September 30, 2020.\n(3) The leverage ratio consists of Tier 1\ncapital divided by total average assets,\nexcluding goodwill and certain other items.\n(4) The supplementary leverage ratio (SLR)\nconsists of Tier 1 capital divided by total\nleverage exposure. Total leverage exposure\nconsists of total average assets, less\ngoodwill and other permitted Tier 1 capital\ndeductions (net of deferred tax liabilities),\nplus certain off-balance sheet exposures.\n168\nTable 23.2 presents the minimum required\nregulatory capital ratios under Transition\nRequirements to which the Company and the Bank\nwere subject as of September 30, 2020, and\nDecember 31, 2019.\nTable 23.2: Minimum Required Regulatory\nCapital Ratios \u2013 Transition Requirements (1)\n                                              \n                     W\u2026                   W\u2026  \n                     F\u2026                   F\u2026  \n                     &                    B\u2026  \n                     C\u2026                   N\u2026  \n           S\u2026        D\u2026        S\u2026         D\u2026  \n           3\u2026        3\u2026        3\u2026         3\u2026  \n           2\u2026        2\u2026        2\u2026         2\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    9\u2026  %     9\u2026        7\u2026        7.\u2026      \n  1                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  1    1\u2026        1\u2026        8\u2026        8.\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    1\u2026        1\u2026        1\u2026        10\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  1    4\u2026        4\u2026        4\u2026        4.\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    5\u2026        5\u2026        6\u2026        6.\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(1) At September 30, 2020, under transition\nrequirements, the CET1, tier 1 and total\ncapital minimum ratio requirements for the\nCompany included a capital conservation buffer\nof 2.50% and a global systemically important\nbank (G-SIB) surcharge of 2.00%.
