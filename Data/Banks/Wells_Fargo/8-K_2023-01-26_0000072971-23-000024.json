Scharf, CEO and President, in the amount of\n$24.5 million, which is unchanged from his\ncompensation last year.\n\nAccording to our executive compensation\ndesign, which remains unchanged from 2021, 65%\nof Mr. Scharf\u2019s total variable compensation is\ndetermined based on the overall performance of\nthe Company and 35% is determined based on the\nassessment of his individual performance\nagainst pre-determined goals set by the Human\nResources Committee (\u201cHRC\u201d) of the Board. In\nFebruary 2022, following a thorough review of\npeer CEO pay levels, the Board established Mr.\nScharf\u2019s target total compensation of $27\nmillion.\n\nThe HRC assessed the Company performance in\nexcess of 100% based on financial metrics\nconsistent with last year and progress against\nthe strategic priorities. In assessing Mr.\nScharf\u2019s individual performance, the HRC\nreviewed the significant body of work still\nnecessary to transform the Company and noted\nhis strong leadership and demonstrated\nprogress in addressing key risk and control\nissues, advancing our business interests and\ncontributions to our communities, upskilling\ntalent while building a diverse and inclusive\nworkforce, and positioning the Company for\nfuture success. Based on these considerations\nand the overall Company performance, the\nprogram design would have resulted in a total\ncompensation above Mr. Scharf\u2019s target of $27\nmillion.\n\nPrior to the HRC reaching its recommendation\non CEO compensation, Mr. Scharf approached the\nChair of the HRC and asked the HRC and the\nBoard to consider not increasing his\ncompensation. Mr. Scharf acknowledged the\nstrong performance of the Company and\nsignificant progress in its transformation\njourney but noted the remaining work left to\nbe completed and therefore, did not believe an\nincrease in compensation level was appropriate\nthis year.\n\nThe HRC considered and agreed with Mr.\nScharf\u2019s suggestion and exercised negative\ndiscretion by recommending to the Board a\nlower compensation level versus the outcome of\nthe plan, and the Board approved this\nrecommendation. Mr. Scharf\u2019s compensation\nconsists of a base salary of $2.5 million and\ntotal variable compensation of $22 million,\nwhich is consistent with the prior year. The\nvariable incentive compensation will be\nstructured as: a cash incentive of $5.4\nmillion; a long-term Performance Share award\nof $10.8 million; and a long-term Restricted\nShare Rights award of $5.8 million. The HRC\nmade no changes to key terms and conditions of\nthe Performance Share award and Restricted\nShare Rights award. Mr. Scharf\u2019s long-term\nstock awards will be subject to our stock\nownership policy.\n\nUnder Mr. Scharf\u2019s leadership, Wells Fargo\ndelivered strong results despite the\nchallenging macro environment:\n\n\u2022 Advanced our strategic capabilities relating\nto business operations, infrastructure, and\ncustomer growth.\n\n\u2022 Delivered value with net income of $13.2\nbillion and diluted earnings per share of\n$3.14.\n\n\u2022 Continued progress in addressing risk,\ncontrol and regulatory issues, including\nreaching a broad-reaching settlement with the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)\nresolving multiple matters.\n\n\u2022 Building and expanding a high-performance\nleadership team, improving succession\nreadiness, and stabilizing key business and\nfunctional areas through focused and effective\ntalent, leadership, and culture initiatives.\n\n\u2022 Demonstrating and delivering measurable\nresults on our commitments to serve our\ncommunities and other stakeholders; published\nthe inaugural Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nreport.\n\n\u2022 Enhanced the customer experience through\ninnovative products and services, including\ntwo new credit cards, new digital offerings\nfor customers and helping customers avoid\noverdraft fees.\n\nThe Board expressed strong confidence in Mr.\nScharf\u2019s leadership in driving the continued\ntransformation of Wells Fargo and values his\nongoing contribution and commitment to our\nshareholders, customers, communities, and\nemployees.\n\nAdditional important information about the\nHRC\u2019s oversight of the Company\u2019s governance\nand executive compensation philosophy,\npolicies, and practices for Mr. Scharf and the\nother named executive officers, will be\npresented in our proxy statement for the 2023\nannual meeting of stockholders, expected to be\nfiled with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission in March 2023.\n                                              \n  Item 9.01 Financial Statements and          \n  Exhibits.                                   \n                                              \n(d) Exhibits\n                                              \n  Exhibit No.    Description     Location     \n                 Cover Page      Embedded     \n  104            Interactive     within the   \n                 Data File.
