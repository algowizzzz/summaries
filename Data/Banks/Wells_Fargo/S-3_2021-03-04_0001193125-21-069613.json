The dollars you invest\nwill go towards purchasing whole and\nfractional shares. Each investment can be for\nas little as $25. Your total investment for\nany calendar year is limited to $120,000. For\npurposes of applying the $120,000 annual\nmaximum, we will combine all investments,\nincluding initial and additional investments,\nbut we will exclude dividend reinvestments.\nCheck\u0096 To make an investment by check,\ncomplete and return a Transaction Request\nForm(attached to your account statement)\ntogether with your payment. The check must be\nmade payable to \u0093EQ Shareowner Services\u0094 in\nU.S. dollars and drawn on a U.S. or Canadian\nfinancial institution.

You can authorize\nautomatic monthly or semi-monthly investments\nby signing on to shareowneronline.com, by\ntelephone or by sending an Account\nAuthorization Formby mail (see Question 22).\nRequests are processed and become effective as\npromptly as administratively possible. Once\nthe automatic withdrawal is initiated, funds\nwill be debited from your designated bank\naccount on or about the 15th and/or the 30th\nof each month. The funds will be invested on\nthe next investment date (see Question 10)\nthat is at least three business days after the\nwithdrawal is made. Changes in or a\ndiscontinuation of automatic withdrawals can\nbe made online, by telephone or by using the\nTransaction Request Formattached to your\nstatement. To be effective with respect to a\nparticular investment date, the Plan\nAdministrator must receive a change request at\nleast 15 trading days prior to the investment\ndate. You may obtain a return of any cash\ninvestment upon request received by the Plan\nAdministrator on or before the second business\nday prior to the date on which it is to be\ninvested. Purchases may be subject to certain\nfees and conditions (see Question 6). All\ncommon stock purchased under this Plan will be\nheld by the Plan Administrator for the benefit\nof all participants together in its name or in\nthe name of its nominee. The Plan\nAdministrator shall have no liability in\nconnection with any inability to purchase\ncommon stock, the timing of any purchases or\nthe value of Wells Fargo common stock acquired\nfor the participant\u0092s account. If any optional\ncash investment, including payment by check or\nautomatic withdrawal, is returned for any\nreason, the Plan Administrator will remove\nfrom the participant\u0092s account any common\nstock purchased with such funds, and will sell\nthese shares. The Plan Administrator may also\nsell additional common stock in the account to\nrecover a returned funds fee for each optional\ncash investment returned unpaid for any reason\nand may sell additional shares as necessary to\ncover any market loss incurred by the Plan\nAdministrator. 5\n\nParticipants\u0092 funds held by the Plan\nAdministrator will not earn interest. During\nthe period that an optional cash investment is\npending, the collected funds in the possession\nof the Plan Administrator may be invested in\ncertain Permitted Investments. For purposes of\nthis Plan, \u0093Permitted Investments\u0094 shall mean\nthe Plan Administrator may hold the funds\nuninvested or invested in select Wells Fargo\ndeposit products. The risk of any loss from\nsuch Permitted Investments shall be the\nresponsibility of the Plan Administrator.\nInvestment income from such Permitted\nInvestments shall be retained by the Plan\nAdministrator. Purchases by Wells Fargo\nemployees and affiliates must be made in\ncompliance with Wells Fargo\u0092s Insider Trading\nPolicy. In addition to other limitations, the\nInsider Trading Policy provides that the\nemployee or affiliate may not trade in Wells\nFargo\u0092s common stock if in possession of\nmaterial, non-publicinformation about Wells\nFargo.\n                                              \n  8.  What are my dividend reinvestment       \n      options?                                \n                                              \nThe Plan Administrator will apply all or a\nportion of your dividends, as elected (less\nany applicable fee), to purchase additional\nwhole or fractional shares. Dividends are\ninvested as soon as administratively possible\non or following the dividend payment date, and\nno later than 30 trading days following the\ndividend payable date. Depending on the number\nof shares being purchased and the current\ntrading volume, a purchase may be executed in\nmultiple transactions that may occur on more\nthan one day. Should this occur, the price\nwill be the weighted average of all trades\nexecuted. The reinvestment option you elect\nwill apply to all your Wells Fargo shares \u0096\nwhether held in certificate form, in direct\nregistration or in the Plan. If you do not\nselect an option, the Plan Administrator will\ndefault your choice to full reinvestment.\n                                              \n      Full dividend reinvestment. If you      \n      elect full dividend reinvestment, all   \n      cash dividends payable on               \n      shares held in the Plan, along with     \n      any shares held in physical             \n      certificate form or through book-entry  \n      Direct Registration Shares (\u0093DRS\u0094), will  \n      be used to purchase additional shares.  \n      You will not receive cash dividends     \n      from us;                                \n      instead, all dividends will be          \n      reinvested. Whole and fractional        \n      shares will be allocated to your Plan   \n      account.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n      Partial dividend reinvestment by        \n      percentage. You may elect to reinvest   \n      a portion of the dividend and           \n      receive the remainder in cash. The      \n      percentage elected will be applied      \n      against the total shares held in the    \n      Plan, along with any shares held in     \n      physical certificate form or held       \n      through DRS. You may elect percentages  \n      from 10%-90%, in increments of 10%.     \n      The cash portion of dividends will be   \n      sent by check unless you have elected   \n      to have those dividends deposited       \n      directly to a designated bank account.  \n      To authorize direct deposit,            \n      complete Section\u00a06 of the Account       \n      Authorization Form.                     \n                                              \nAn example of partial reinvestment by\npercentage: A participant has a total of 150\nshares. The participant chooses to have 50% of\nthe total dividend reinvested. This will\nequate to 75 shares having dividends\nreinvested and 75 shares having dividends paid\nin cash.\n                                              \n      No Dividend Reinvestment. If you elect  \n      no dividend reinvestment, the Plan      \n      Administrator will pay to               \n      you, in cash or by direct deposit,      \n      cash dividends paid on all your Wells   \n      Fargo shares. To authorize direct       \n      deposit, complete Section\u00a06 of the      \n      Account Authorization Form.             \n                                              \nYou may change your reinvestment option at any\ntime online, by telephone or by sending\nwritten notice to the Plan Administrator (See\nQuestion 22). Notices received on or before a\ndividend record date will be effective for\nthat cash dividend. Notices received after a\ndividend record date will not be effective\nuntil after that cash dividend has been paid.\n6\n                                \n  9.  When are dividends paid?  \n                                \nHistorically, Wells Fargo has paid dividends\non the first day of March, June, September and\nDecember to stockholders of record on the\nfirst or second Friday of February, May,\nAugust and November, respectively. The\ndividend payment date and dividend record date\nmay change in the future. To have your cash\ndividends reinvested, the Plan Administrator\nmust receive your Account Authorization\nFormauthorizing dividend reinvestment on or\nbefore the dividend record date. The payment\nof dividends on Wells Fargo common stock is at\nthe discretion of Wells Fargo\u0092s Board of\nDirectors. There is no guarantee that Wells\nFargo will pay dividends in the future.

Investments\nmay be postponed if necessary to comply with\nRegulation M under the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934, as amended (the \u0093 Exchange Act\u0094), or\nother applicable provisions of securities law.\nShares are purchased and sold for the Plan on\nspecified dates or during specified periods.\nAs a result, you do not have any control over\nthe price at which shares are purchased or\nsold for your account, and you may pay a\nhigher purchase price or receive a lower sales\nprice than if you had purchased or sold the\nshares outside of the Plan. You bear the risk\nof fluctuations in the price of Wells Fargo\ncommon stock. No interest is paid on funds\nheld by the Plan Administrator pending their\ninvestment. All optional cash investments,\nincluding the initial cash investment, are\nsubject to collection by the Plan\nAdministrator of the full face value in U.S.\nfunds. All transactions under this Plan are\nsubject to compliance by Wells Fargo and you\nwith all applicable legal requirements and all\napplicable regulations of any stock exchange\non which Wells Fargo common stock may be\n\u0093listed.\u0094\n                                              \n  11.  How does the Plan Administrator buy    \n       the shares?                            \n                                              \nThe Plan Administrator may purchase Wells\nFargo common stock from Wells Fargo or use an\nindependent agent to buy the shares in the\nopen market or in negotiated transactions. We\ndetermine the method. We currently use an\nindependent agent to buy Plan shares, but we\ncan change this at any time without notice to\nyou, subject to legal restrictions on how\noften we change the method. The method used by\nthe Plan Administrator will impact the\ndetermination of the price at which your\nshares are purchased (see Question 12). 7\n                                              \n  12.

The independent agent\npurchases shares as soon as administratively\npossible, and in no event more than 5 business\ndays, after the applicable investment date.\nPurchases from Wells Fargo.If the shares are\npurchased from Wells Fargo, your purchase\nprice will be the New York Stock Exchange-only\nclosing price of Wells Fargo common stock for\nthat investment date. If the New York Stock\nExchange is closed on that date, then the\nprice will be the New York Stock Exchange-only\nclosing price of Wells Fargo common stock for\nthe next business day the Exchange is open.\nThe Plan Administrator may commingle your\nfunds with those of other participants for\npurposes of forwarding purchase orders to the\nindependent agent. Also, the Plan\nAdministrator may offset purchase and sale\norders for the same investment date,\nforwarding to the independent agent the net\npurchase or sale requirement. Because the\nprices at which shares are purchased under the\nPlan are beyond your control, you may lose any\nadvantage otherwise available from being able\nto select the timing of your investment.\n                                              \n  13.

The price specified in the order\nmust be below the current market price\n(generally used to limit a market loss). If\nyou select a Batch Order, please be aware:\n                                              \n      The Plan Administrator may match or     \n      offset your sale order against one or   \n      more purchase orders of other Plan      \n      participants. If your sale order is     \n      offset against purchase orders, your    \n      sale proceeds are based on the          \n      weighted average price at which the     \n      net purchase order is filled.           \n                                              \n                                              \n      If the Plan Administrator does not      \n      offset your order, the independent      \n      agent executes the order on your        \n      behalf                                  \n      in the open market or in a negotiated   \n      transaction. The independent agent may  \n      sell Plan shares to Wells Fargo. If     \n      the independent agent executes your     \n      order in the open market or in a        \n      negotiated transaction, the proceeds    \n      are based on the weighted               \n      average price at which the shares are   \n      sold.                                   \n                                              \nIf you wish to sell any shares currently held\nin certificate form, you may send them in for\ndeposit to your Plan account and then proceed\nwith the sale. 10\n\nAfter settlement of the sale, the Plan\nAdministrator will send you a check for the\nproceeds of the sale net of brokerage\ncommissions and transaction fees charged by\nthe Plan Administrator or if you choose, you\nmay have your proceeds, minus brokerage\ncommissions and transaction fees, directly\ndeposited to your bank account. Refer to\nQuestion 6 for a discussion of brokerage\ncommissions and transaction fees. If you\nsubmit a Transaction Request Formfrom your\naccount statement to sell all or part of your\nPlan shares, and you are requesting the net\nproceeds to be automatically deposited to a\nbank checking or savings account, you must\nprovide a voided blank check for a checking\naccount or a blank savings deposit slip for a\nsavings account. If you are unable to provide\na voided check or deposit slip, your written\nrequest must have your signature(s) medallion\nguaranteed by an eligible financial\ninstitution for direct deposit. Requests for\nautomatic deposit of net sale proceeds that do\nnot provide the required documentation will\nnot be honored and a check for the net\nproceeds will be issued. The price of Wells\nFargo common stock fluctuates on a daily\nbasis. The price may rise or fall after you\nsubmit your request to sell and prior to the\nultimate sale of your shares. The price risk\nwill be borne solely by you. You cannot revoke\nyour request to sell once it is made.

If you have authorized\nrecurring automatic bank withdrawals, the Plan\nAdministrator must receive your request at\nleast 15 business days before the next\nscheduled investment date to ensure that the\nrequest is effective for that investment date.\nIf your request is received on or after a\ndividend record date but before the dividend\npayment date, your termination will be\nprocessed as soon as administratively\npossible, and a separate dividend check will\nbe mailed to you.

In    \n      addition, you may be treated as having  \n      received income in the amount of any    \n      brokerage commissions or other fees     \n      paid by Wells Fargo on your behalf.     \n                                              \n                                              \n      The tax basis of shares purchased with  \n      reinvested dividends or optional cash   \n      investments generally is the            \n      amount you paid to acquire the shares,  \n      including any trading fees or           \n      commissions that you pay or that are    \n      paid on your behalf. Your holding       \n      period for shares purchased under the   \n      Plan generally will begin on the day    \n      following the date on which those       \n      shares are credited to your Plan        \n      account.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n      You do not realize taxable income from  \n      the transfer of shares to your Plan     \n      account or from the withdrawal of       \n      whole shares from your Plan account.    \n      You will, however, generally realize    \n      gain or loss from the receipt of cash   \n      instead of any fractional Plan share.   \n      You will also realize gain or loss      \n      when your Plan shares are sold. The     \n      amount of the gain or loss              \n      generally will be the difference        \n      between the amount you receive for the  \n      shares and the tax basis of the         \n      shares.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      The Plan Administrator reports          \n      dividend income to participants and     \n      the Internal Revenue Service            \n      (\u0093IRS\u0094) on Form 1099-DIV. The Plan        \n      Administrator reports the proceeds      \n      from the sale of Plan shares to the     \n      selling participants and the IRS on     \n      Form                                    \n      1099-B. The Plan Administrator reports  \n      dividend income to a foreign person     \n      (nonresident alien individual or        \n      foreign entity) and the IRS on Form     \n      1042-S.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      Dividends and sale proceeds are         \n      generally subject to federal backup     \n      withholding if you fail to cretify a    \n      taxpayer identification number to the   \n      Plan Administrator. Any amount          \n      withheld as backup withholding tax      \n      will be allowable as a refund or        \n      credit against your U.S. federal        \n      income tax liability. Dividends         \n      payable to participants residing in     \n      certain                                 \n      foreign countries may also be subject   \n      to federal withholding, as discussed    \n      below. In any case in which federal     \n      income taxes are required to be         \n      withheld, the Plan Administrator        \n      reinvests or pays to you, as the case   \n      may be, an amount equal to the          \n      dividends or sale proceeds less the     \n      amount of tax withheld. For IRS         \n      reporting purposes, the amount of any   \n      dividend withheld is included in your   \n      dividend income.                        \n                                              \nThis Plan assumes that each participant will\nuse the first-in, first-out(\u0093 FIFO\u0094) method\nwhen determining the tax basis of any shares\nsold. Participants may designate their\npreference for a different method of\ndetermining the tax basis of shares by\nidentifying this preference in writing to the\nPlan Administrator. Participants may designate\ntheir preference for specific identification\ntax basis at any time. A foreign person\n(nonresident alien individual or foreign\nentity) is subject to U.S. federal income tax\nwithholding at a 30% rate under Chapter 3 of\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended, (\u0093 IRC\u0094) on the gross amount of\ncertain payments of U.S. source income\nincluding dividends, unless the beneficial\nowner of the payment demonstrates that it is\nentitled to a reduced rate of, or exemption\nfrom, withholding tax under an income tax\ntreaty by providing the relevant Form\nW-8.Accounts owned by certain foreign entities\nthat fail to comply with various U.S.\ninformation reporting and due diligence\nrequirements (generally relating to ownership\nby U.S. persons of interests in or accounts\nwith those entities) under Chapter 4 of the\nIRC, frequently referred to as \u0093FATCA,\u0094 may be\nsubject to 30% withholding on all applicable\nU.S. sourced income, including dividends. An\nintergovernmental agreement between the United\nStates and an applicable foreign country may\nmodify these requirements. Foreign persons\nshould consult with their tax advisors or\ncounsel as to which tax certification form\nthey are required to provide and for more\nspecific information regarding the withholding\nrequirements under Chapters 3 and 4 (FATCA) of\nthe IRC. 13\n\nThe discussion above is only a summary of the\nimportant U.S. federal income tax consequences\nof your participation in the Plan. The summary\nis based on the IRC, United States Treasury\nRegulations, administrative rulings and court\ndecisions, as in effect as of the date of this\nprospectus, all of which are subject to change\nat any time, possibly with retroactive effect.\nThis summary is not a complete description of\nall of the tax consequences of your\nparticipation in the Plan.
