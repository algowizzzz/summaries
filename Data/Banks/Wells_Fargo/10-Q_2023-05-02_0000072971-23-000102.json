For additional information, including the\nfinancial statement line items impacted by the\nadoption of ASU 2018-12, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) to Financial\nStatements in this Report.\n\n(2) Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is total\nrevenue less noninterest expense. Management\nbelieves that PTPP is a useful financial measure\nbecause it enables investors and others to assess\nthe Company\u2019s ability to generate capital to cover\ncredit losses through a credit cycle.\n\n(3) Includes provision for credit losses for loans,\ndebt securities, and interest-earning deposits with\nbanks.\n\n(4) Book value per common share is common\nstockholders\u2019 equity divided by common shares\noutstanding. Tangible book value per common share\nis tangible common equity divided by common shares\noutstanding.\n\n(5) Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure and represents total equity less preferred\nequity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain\nidentifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage\nservicing rights) and goodwill and other\nintangibles on investments in consolidated\nportfolio companies, net of applicable deferred\ntaxes. The methodology of determining tangible\ncommon equity may differ among companies.\nManagement believes that return on average tangible\ncommon equity and tangible book value per common\nshare, which utilize tangible common equity, are\nuseful financial measures because they enable\nmanagement, investors, and others to assess the\nCompany\u2019s use of equity. For additional\ninformation, including a corresponding\nreconciliation to generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (GAAP) financial measures, see the\n\u201cCapital Management \u2013 Tangible Common Equity\u201d\nsection in this Report.\n\n(6) Represents Wells Fargo net income divided by\naverage assets.\n\n(7) Represents Wells Fargo net income applicable to\ncommon stock divided by average common\nstockholders\u2019 equity.\n\n(8) The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense\ndivided by total revenue (net interest income and\nnoninterest income).\n\n(9) For additional information, see the \u201cCapital\nManagement\u201d section and Note 21 (Regulatory Capital\nRequirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial\nStatements in this Report.\n\n(10) Represents TLAC divided by RWAs, which is our\nbinding TLAC ratio, determined by using the greater\nof RWAs under the Standardized and Advanced\nApproaches.\n\n(11) Represents average high-quality liquid assets\ndivided by average projected net cash outflows, as\neach is defined under the LCR rule.\n                              \n  2    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                              \nThis Quarterly Report, including the Financial\nReview and the Financial Statements and related\nNotes, contains forward-looking statements, which\nmay include forecasts of our financial results and\ncondition, expectations for our operations and\nbusiness, and our assumptions for those forecasts\nand expectations. Do not unduly rely on forward-\nlooking statements. Actual results may differ\nmaterially from our forward-looking statements due\nto several factors. Factors that could cause our\nactual results to differ materially from our\nforward-looking statements are described in this\nReport, including in the \u201cForward-Looking\nStatements\u201d section, and in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and\n\u201cRegulation and Supervision\u201d sections of our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2022 ( 2022 Form 10-K).\n\nWhen we refer to \u201cWells Fargo,\u201d \u201cthe Company,\u201d\n\u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d in this Report, we mean Wells\nFargo & Company and Subsidiaries (consolidated).\nWhen we refer to the \u201cParent,\u201d we mean Wells Fargo\n& Company. See the \u201cGlossary of Acronyms\u201d for\ndefinitions of terms used throughout this Report.\n                                                   \n   Financial Review                                \n                                                   \n            \n  Overview  \n            \nWells Fargo & Company is\na leading financial\nservices company that\nhas approximately $1.9\ntrillion in assets,\nproudly serves one in\nthree U.S. households\nand more than 10% of\nsmall businesses in the\nU.S., and is a leading\nmiddle market banking\nprovider in the U.S. We\nprovide a diversified\nset of banking,\ninvestment and mortgage\nproducts and services,\nas well as consumer and\ncommercial finance,\nthrough our four\nreportable operating\nsegments: Consumer\nBanking and Lending,\nCommercial Banking,\nCorporate and Investment\nBanking, and Wealth and\nInvestment Management.\nWells Fargo ranked No.\n41 on Fortune\u2019s 2022\nrankings of America\u2019s\nlargest corporations. We\nranked fourth in assets\nand third in the market\nvalue of our common\nstock among all U.S.\nbanks at March 31, 2023.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s top\npriority remains\nbuilding a risk and\ncontrol infrastructure\nappropriate for its size\nand complexity. The\nCompany is subject to a\nnumber of consent orders\nand other regulatory\nactions, which may\nrequire the Company,\namong other things, to\nundertake certain\nchanges to its business,\noperations, products and\nservices, and risk\nmanagement practices.\nAddressing these\nregulatory actions is\nexpected to take\nmultiple years, and we\nare likely to continue\nto experience issues or\ndelays along the way in\nsatisfying their\nrequirements. We are\nalso likely to continue\nto identify more issues\nas we implement our risk\nand control\ninfrastructure, which\nmay result in additional\nregulatory actions.\nIssues or delays with\none regulatory action\ncould affect our\nprogress on others, and\nfailure to satisfy the\nrequirements of a\nregulatory action on a\ntimely basis could\nresult in additional\npenalties, business\nrestrictions,\nenforcement actions, and\nother negative\nconsequences, which\ncould be significant.\nWhile we still have\nsignificant work to do\nand have not yet\nsatisfied certain\naspects of these\nregulatory actions, the\nCompany is committed to\ndevoting the resources\nnecessary to operate\nwith strong business\npractices and controls,\nmaintain the highest\nlevel of integrity, and\nhave an appropriate\nculture in place.\n\nFederal Reserve Board\nConsent Order Regarding\nGovernance Oversight and\nCompliance and\nOperational Risk\nManagement\n\nOn February 2, 2018, the\nCompany entered into a\nconsent order with the\nBoard of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve\nSystem (FRB). As\nrequired by the consent\norder, the Company\u2019s\nBoard of Directors\n(Board) submitted to the\nFRB a plan to further\nenhance the Board\u2019s\ngovernance and oversight\nof the Company, and the\nCompany submitted to the\nFRB a plan to further\nimprove the Company\u2019s\ncompliance and\noperational risk\nmanagement program. The\nCompany continues to\nengage with the FRB as\nthe Company works to\naddress the consent\norder provisions. The\nconsent order also\nrequires the Company,\nfollowing the FRB\u2019s\n\nacceptance and approval\nof the plans and the\nCompany\u2019s adoption and\nimplementation of the\nplans, to complete an\ninitial third-party\nreview of the\nenhancements and\nimprovements provided\nfor in the plans. Until\nthis third-party review\nis complete and the\nplans are approved and\nimplemented to the\nsatisfaction of the FRB,\nthe Company\u2019s total\nconsolidated assets as\ndefined under the\nconsent order will be\nlimited to the level as\nof December 31, 2017.\nCompliance with this\nasset cap is measured on\na two-quarter daily\naverage basis to allow\nfor management of\ntemporary fluctuations.\nAfter removal of the\nasset cap, a second\nthird-party review must\nalso be conducted to\nassess the efficacy and\nsustainability of the\nenhancements and\nimprovements.\n\nConsent Orders with the\nConsumer Financial\nProtection Bureau and\nOffice of the\nComptroller of the\nCurrency Regarding\nCompliance Risk\nManagement Program,\nAutomobile Collateral\nProtection Insurance\nPolicies, and Mortgage\nInterest Rate Lock\nExtensions\n\nOn April 20, 2018, the\nCompany entered into\nconsent orders with the\nConsumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (CFPB)\nand the Office of the\nComptroller of the\nCurrency (OCC) to pay an\naggregate of $1 billion\nin civil money penalties\nto resolve matters\nregarding the Company\u2019s\ncompliance risk\nmanagement program and\npast practices involving\ncertain automobile\ncollateral protection\ninsurance (CPI) policies\nand certain mortgage\ninterest rate lock\nextensions. As required\nby the consent orders,\nthe Company submitted to\nthe CFPB and OCC an\nenterprise-wide\ncompliance risk\nmanagement plan and a\nplan to enhance the\nCompany\u2019s internal audit\nprogram with respect to\nfederal consumer\nfinancial law and the\nterms of the consent\norders. In addition, as\nrequired by the consent\norders, the Company\nsubmitted for non-\nobjection plans to\nremediate customers\naffected by the\nautomobile collateral\nprotection insurance and\nmortgage interest rate\nlock matters, as well as\na plan for the\nmanagement of\nremediation activities\nconducted by the\nCompany. The Company\ncontinues to work to\naddress the provisions\nof the consent orders.\nOn September 9, 2021,\nthe OCC assessed a $250\nmillion civil money\npenalty against the\nCompany related to\ninsufficient progress in\naddressing requirements\nunder the OCC\u2019s April\n2018 consent order and\nloss mitigation\nactivities in the\nCompany\u2019s Home Lending\nbusiness. On December\n20, 2022, the CFPB\nmodified its consent\norder to clarify how it\nwould terminate.\n\nConsent Order with the\nOCC Regarding Loss\nMitigation Activities\n\nOn September 9, 2021,\nthe Company entered into\na consent order with the\nOCC requiring the\nCompany to improve the\n                              \n  Wells Fargo & Company    3  \n                              \n                                                   \n  Overview(continued)                              \n                                                   \nexecution, risk\nmanagement, and\noversight of loss\nmitigation activities in\nits Home Lending\nbusiness. In addition,\nthe consent order\nrestricts the Company\nfrom acquiring certain\nthird-party residential\nmortgage servicing and\nlimits transfers of\ncertain mortgage loans\nrequiring customer\nremediation out of the\nCompany\u2019s mortgage\nservicing portfolio\nuntil remediation is\nprovided.\n\nConsent Order with the\nCFPB Regarding\nAutomobile Lending,\nConsumer Deposit\nAccounts, and Mortgage\nLending\n\nOn December 20, 2022,\nthe Company entered into\na consent order with the\nCFPB requiring the\nCompany to provide\ncustomer remediation for\nmultiple matters related\nto automobile lending,\nconsumer deposit\naccounts, and mortgage\nlending; maintain\npractices designed to\nensure auto lending\ncustomers receive\nrefunds for the unused\nportion of certain\nguaranteed automobile\nprotection agreements;\ncomply with certain\nbusiness practice\nrequirements related to\nconsumer deposit\naccounts; and pay a $1.7\nbillion civil penalty to\nthe CFPB. The required\nactions related to many\nof these matters were\nalready substantially\ncomplete at the time we\nentered into the consent\norder, and the consent\norder lays out a path to\ntermination after the\nCompany completes the\nremainder of the\nrequired actions.\n                                                   \n  Retail Sales Practices Matters                   \n                                                   \nIn September 2016, we\nannounced settlements\nwith the CFPB, the OCC,\nand the Office of the\nLos Angeles City\nAttorney, and entered\ninto related consent\norders with the CFPB and\nthe OCC, in connection\nwith allegations that\nsome of our retail\ncustomers received\nproducts and services\nthey did not request. As\na result, it remains a\npriority to rebuild\ntrust through a\ncomprehensive action\nplan that includes\nmaking things right for\nour customers,\nemployees, and other\nstakeholders, and\nbuilding a better\nCompany for the future.\nOn September 8, 2021,\nthe CFPB consent order\nregarding retail sales\npractices expired.\n\nFor additional\ninformation regarding\nretail sales practices\nmatters, including\nrelated legal and\nregulatory risk, see the\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d section\nin our 2022 Form 10-K.\n                                                   \n  Customer Remediation Activities                  \n                                                   \nOur priority of\nrebuilding trust has\nincluded an effort to\nidentify areas or\ninstances where\ncustomers may have\nexperienced financial\nharm, provide\nremediation as\nappropriate, and\nimplement additional\noperational and control\nprocedures. We are\nworking with our\nregulatory agencies in\nthis effort.\n\nWe have accrued for the\nprobable and estimable\ncosts related to our\ncustomer remediation\nactivities, which\namounts may change based\non additional facts and\ninformation, as well as\nongoing reviews and\ncommunications with our\nregulators. As our\nongoing reviews continue\nand as we continue to\nstrengthen our risk and\ncontrol infrastructure,\nwe have identified and\nmay in the future\nidentify additional\nitems or areas of\npotential concern. To\nthe extent issues are\nidentified, we will\ncontinue to assess any\ncustomer harm and\nprovide remediation as\nappropriate. We have\npreviously disclosed key\nareas of focus as part\nof these activities.\n\nFor additional\ninformation regarding\nthese activities,\nincluding related legal\nand regulatory risk, see\nthe \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nsection in our 2022 Form\n10-K.\n                                                   \n  Recent Developments                              \n                                                   \n                                                   \n  LIBOR Transition                                 \n                                                   \nThe London Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR) is\na widely referenced\nbenchmark rate that\nseeks to estimate the\ncost at\n\nwhich banks can borrow\non an unsecured basis\nfrom other banks. On\nMarch 5, 2021, the\nUnited Kingdom\u2019s\nFinancial Conduct\nAuthority and ICE\nBenchmark\nAdministration, the\nadministrator of LIBOR,\nannounced that certain\nsettings of LIBOR would\nno longer be published\non a representative\nbasis after December 31,\n2021, and the most\ncommonly used U.S.\ndollar (USD) LIBOR\nsettings would no longer\nbe published on a\nrepresentative basis\nafter June 30, 2023.\n\nIn first quarter 2022,\nthe Adjustable Interest\nRate (LIBOR) Act (the\nLIBOR Act) was enacted\ninto U.S. federal law to\nprovide a statutory\nframework to replace\nLIBOR with a benchmark\nrate based on the\nSecured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (SOFR) in\nU.S. law contracts that\ndo not have fallback\nprovisions or that have\nfallback provisions\nresulting in a\nreplacement rate based\non LIBOR. The FRB\nadopted a final rule\nimplementing the LIBOR\nAct on December 16,\n2022, which became\neffective on February\n27, 2023. We expect that\nthe LIBOR Act will\ntransition certain of\nour legacy USD LIBOR\ncontracts that do not\nhave appropriate\nfallback provisions to\nthe applicable SOFR-\nbased replacement rates\nspecified in the FRB\u2019s\nfinal rule.\n\nIn preparation for the\ncessation of USD LIBOR\non a representative\nbasis, we no longer\noffer new contracts\nreferencing LIBOR,\nsubject to limited\nexceptions based on\nregulatory guidance. We\nalso continue to execute\nour LIBOR transition\nactivities to enhance\nour operational\nreadiness.\n\nFor certain contracts,\nincluding commercial\ncredit facilities and\nrelated derivatives, we\ncontinue to proactively\nengage with our clients\nand contract parties to\nreplace LIBOR with SOFR-\nbased rates or other\nalternative reference\nrates in advance of the\nJune 30, 2023 transition\ndate.\n\nFollowing June 30, 2023,\nwe expect substantially\nall of our consumer\nloans, commercial credit\nfacilities, debt\nsecurities, derivatives,\nand long-term debt\nindexed to USD LIBOR to\ntransition to SOFR-based\nor other alternative\nreference rates in\naccordance with existing\nfallback provisions or\nthe LIBOR Act.\n\nFor additional\ninformation regarding\nthe risks and potential\nimpact of LIBOR or any\nother referenced\nfinancial metric being\nsignificantly changed,\nreplaced or\ndiscontinued, see the\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d section\nin our 2022 Form 10-K.\n                                                   \n  Financial Performance                            \n                                                   \n                                                   \n  Adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2018-12  \n                                                   \nIn first quarter 2023,\nwe adopted FASB ASU\n2018-12 \u2013 Financial\nServices \u2013 Insurance\n(Topic 944): Targeted\nImprovements to the\nAccounting for Long-\nDuration Contracts . The\nmost significant impact\nof adoption related to\nreinsurance of variable\nannuity products for a\nlimited number of our\ninsurance clients. These\nvariable annuity\nproducts contain\nguaranteed minimum\nbenefits that require us\nto make benefit payments\nfor the remainder of the\npolicyholder\u2019s life once\nthe policyholder's\naccount values are\nexhausted. Our\nreinsurance business is\nno longer entering into\nnew contracts. The ASU\nrequires these\nguaranteed minimum\nbenefits (referred to as\nmarket risk benefits) to\nbe measured at fair\nvalue through earnings\n(recognized in other\nnoninterest income),\nexcept for changes in\nfair value attributable\nto our own credit risk,\nwhich are recognized in\nother comprehensive\nincome.\n\nWe adopted this ASU with\nretrospective\napplication, which\nrequired revision of\nprior period financial\nstatements.

The net\nimpact of the funding\ncharges or credits is\nrecognized in corporate\ntreasury.\n\nRevenue and Expense\nSharing When lines of\nbusiness jointly serve\ncustomers, the line of\nbusiness that is\nresponsible for\nproviding the product or\nservice recognizes\nrevenue or expense with\na referral fee paid or\nan allocation of cost to\nthe other line of\nbusiness based on\nestablished internal\nrevenue-sharing\nagreements.\n\nWhen a line of business\nuses a service provided\nby another line of\nbusiness or enterprise\nfunction (included in\nCorporate), expense is\ngenerally allocated\nbased on the cost and\nuse of the service\nprovided.\n\nTaxable-Equivalent\nAdjustments Taxable-\nequivalent adjustments\nrelated to tax-exempt\nincome on certain loans\nand debt securities are\nincluded in net interest\nincome, while taxable-\nequivalent adjustments\nrelated to income tax\ncredits for low-income\nhousing and renewable\nenergy investments are\nincluded in noninterest\nincome, in each case\nwith corresponding\nimpacts to income tax\nexpense (benefit).\nAdjustments are included\nin Corporate, Commercial\nBanking, and Corporate\nand Investment Banking\nand are eliminated to\nreconcile to the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial results.\n\nAllocated Capital\nReportable operating\nsegments are allocated\ncapital under a risk-\nsensitive framework that\nis primarily based on\naspects of our\nregulatory capital\nrequirements, and the\nassumptions and\nmethodologies used to\nallocate capital are\nperiodically assessed\nand revised. Effective\nJanuary 1, 2023,\nmanagement modified its\ncapital allocation\nmethodology to improve\nalignment of allocated\ncapital with the binding\nregulatory constraints\nof the Company.\nManagement believes that\nreturn on allocated\ncapital is a useful\nfinancial measure\nbecause it enables\nmanagement, investors,\nand others to assess a\nreportable operating\nsegment\u2019s use of\ncapital.\n\nSelected Metrics We\npresent certain\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial metrics\nthat management uses\nwhen evaluating\nreportable operating\nsegment results.\nManagement believes that\nthese metrics are useful\nto investors and others\nto assess the\nperformance, customer\ngrowth, and trends of\nreportable operating\nsegments or lines of\nbusiness.\n                                                   \n   Table 5:                                        \n                                                   \n                                                   \n   Management Reporting Structure                  \n                                                   \n                                                   \n  W\u2026                                               \n  F\u2026                                               \n  &                                                \n  C\u2026                                               \n        Co\u2026            Co\u2026    Wea\u2026                 \n        Ba\u2026    Com\u2026    and    and     Co\u2026          \n        and    Ban\u2026    In\u2026    Inv\u2026                 \n        Le\u2026            Ba\u2026    Man\u2026                 \n                                             \u2022     \n        \u2022                                    Cor\u2026  \n        Co\u2026                                  Tre\u2026  \n        and                                  \u2022     \n        Sm\u2026                                  Ent\u2026  \n        Bu\u2026    \u2022                             Fun\u2026  \n        Ba\u2026    Mid\u2026    \u2022      \u2022              \u2022     \n        \u2022      Mar\u2026    Ba\u2026    Wel\u2026           Inv\u2026  \n        Ho\u2026    Ban\u2026    \u2022      Far\u2026           Por\u2026  \n        Le\u2026    \u2022       Co\u2026    Adv\u2026           \u2022     \n        \u2022      Ass\u2026    Re\u2026    \u2022              Aff\u2026  \n        Cr\u2026    Len\u2026    Es\u2026    The            ven\u2026  \n        Ca\u2026    and     \u2022      Pri\u2026           cap\u2026  \n        \u2022      Lea\u2026    Ma\u2026    Bank           and   \n        Au\u2026                                  pri\u2026  \n        \u2022                                    equ\u2026  \n        Pe\u2026                                  bus\u2026  \n        Le\u2026                                  \u2022     \n                                             Non\u2026  \n                                             bus\u2026  \n                                                   \n                               \n  10    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 6 and the\nfollowing discussion\npresent our results by\nreportable operating\nsegment.

We employ\nvarious credit risk\nmanagement and\nmonitoring activities to\nmitigate risks\nassociated with multiple\nrisk factors affecting\nloans we hold including:\n\u2022 Loan concentrations\nand related credit\nquality; \u2022 Counterparty\ncredit risk; \u2022 Economic\nand market conditions; \u2022\nLegislative or\nregulatory mandates; \u2022\nChanges in interest\nrates; \u2022 Merger and\nacquisition activities;\nand \u2022 Reputation risk.\n\nIn addition, the Company\nwill continue to\nintegrate climate\nconsiderations into its\ncredit risk management\nactivities. Our credit\nrisk management\noversight process is\ngoverned centrally, but\nprovides for direct\nmanagement and\naccountability by our\nlines of business. Our\noverall credit process\nincludes comprehensive\ncredit policies,\ndisciplined credit\nunderwriting, frequent\nand detailed risk\nmeasurement and\nmodeling, extensive\ncredit training\nprograms, and a\ncontinual loan review\nand audit process. A key\nto our credit risk\nmanagement is adherence\nto a well-controlled\nunderwriting process,\nwhich we believe is\nappropriate for the\nneeds of our customers\nas well as investors who\npurchase the loans or\nsecurities\ncollateralized by the\nloans.

The\nincrease was driven by\nthe technology, telecom\nand media, and\nentertainment and\nrecreation industries.\n\nThe majority of our\ncommercial and\nindustrial loans and\nlease financing\nportfolio is secured by\nshort-term assets, such\nas accounts receivable,\ninventory and debt\nsecurities, as well as\nlong-lived assets, such\nas equipment and other\nbusiness assets.\n\nGenerally, the primary\nsource of repayment for\nthis portfolio is the\noperating cash flows of\ncustomers, with the\ncollateral securing this\nportfolio representing a\nsecondary source of\nrepayment.\n\nThe portfolio decreased\nat March 31, 2023,\ncompared with December\n31, 2022, as a result of\npaydowns, partially\noffset by seasonally\nhigher loan draws and\nnew originations.

The\ntotal CRE loan portfolio\ndecreased $1.1 billion\nfrom December 31, 2022,\nprimarily driven by a\ndecrease in loans for\nmixed use properties and\noffice property types,\npartially offset by an\nincrease in loans for\nthe apartments property\ntype. The portfolio is\ndiversified both\ngeographically and by\nproperty type. The\nlargest geographic\nconcentrations of CRE\nloans are in California,\nNew York, Texas, and\nFlorida, which\nrepresented a combined\n48% of the total CRE\nportfolio. The largest\nproperty type\nconcentrations are\napartments at 26% and\noffice at 23% of the\nportfolio. Unfunded\ncredit commitments were\n$9.2 billion and $8.8\nbillion at March 31,\n2023, and December 31,\n2022, respectively, for\nCRE mortgage loans and\n$18.9 billion and $20.7\nbillion, respectively,\nfor CRE construction\nloans.\n\nWe generally subject CRE\nloans to individual risk\nassessment using our\ninternal borrower and\ncollateral quality\nratings.

The increase in\ncriticized CRE loans was\npredominantly driven by\nthe office property\ntype. The credit quality\nof the office property\ntype continued to be\nadversely affected as\nweakened demand for\noffice space continued\nto drive higher vacancy\nrates and deteriorating\noperating performance.\nAt March 31, 2023,\nnearly one-third of the\nCRE loans in the office\nproperty type had\nrecourse to a guarantor,\ntypically through a\nrepayment guarantee, in\naddition to the related\ncollateral.

Additionally, we\nmaintain an ACL for debt\nsecurities classified as\neither AFS or HTM, other\nfinancial assets\nmeasured at amortized\ncost, including deposits\nwith banks, net\ninvestments in leases,\nand other off-balance\nsheet credit exposures.\n\nThe process for\nestablishing the ACL for\nloans takes into\nconsideration many\nfactors, including\nhistorical and\nforecasted loss trends,\nloan-level credit\nquality ratings and loan\ngrade-specific\ncharacteristics. The\nprocess involves\nsubjective and complex\njudgments. In addition,\nwe review a variety of\ncredit metrics and\ntrends. These credit\nmetrics and trends,\nhowever, do not solely\ndetermine the amount of\nthe allowance as we use\nseveral analytical\ntools.

The ACL\nfor loans increased $96\nmillion, or 1%, from\nDecember 31, 2022,\nreflecting increases for\ncommercial real estate\nloans, primarily office\nloans, as well as for\ncredit card and auto\nloans, partially offset\nby a decrease for\nresidential mortgage\nloans related to the\nadoption of ASU 2022-02,\nFinancial Instruments-\nCredit Losses (Topic\n326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and\nVintage Disclosures .\nFor additional\ninformation on ASU\n2022-02, see Note 1\n(Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) to\nFinancial Statements in\nthis Report. The detail\nof the changes in the\nACL for loans by\nportfolio segment\n(including charge-offs\nand recoveries by loan\nclass) is included in\nNote 5 (Loans and\nRelated Allowance for\nCredit Losses) to\nFinancial Statements in\nthis Report. We consider\nmultiple economic\nscenarios to develop our\nestimate of the ACL for\nloans, which generally\ninclude a base scenario,\nalong with an optimistic\n(upside) and one or more\npessimistic (downside)\nscenarios. We weighted\nthe base scenario and\nthe downside scenarios\nin our estimate of the\nACL for loans at March\n31, 2023. The base\nscenario assumed\nelevated inflation and\neconomic contraction in\nthe near term,\nreflecting increased\nunemployment rates from\nhistorically low levels\nand declining property\nvalues. The downside\nscenarios assumed a more\nsubstantial economic\ncontraction due to high\ninflation, declining\nproperty values, and\nlower business and\nconsumer confidence.\nAdditionally, we\nconsider qualitative\nfactors that represent\nthe risk of limitations\ninherent in our\nprocesses and\nassumptions such as\neconomic environmental\nfactors, modeling\nassumptions and\nperformance, and other\nsubjective factors,\nincluding industry\ntrends and emerging risk\nassessments.\n\nThe forecasted key\neconomic variables used\nin our estimate of the\nACL for loans at March\n31, 2023, and December\n31, 2022, are presented\nin Table 23.

Future\namounts of the ACL for\nloans will be based on a\nvariety of factors,\nincluding loan balance\nchanges, portfolio\ncredit quality and mix\nchanges, and changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions and\nexpectations (including\nfor unemployment and\nreal GDP), among other\nfactors.\n                               \n  36    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nWe believe the ACL for\nloans of $13.7 billion\nat March 31, 2023, was\nappropriate to cover\nexpected credit losses,\nincluding unfunded\ncredit commitments, at\nthat date. The entire\nallowance is available\nto absorb credit losses\nfrom the total loan\nportfolio. The ACL for\nloans is subject to\nchange and reflects\nexisting factors as of\nthe date of\ndetermination, including\neconomic or market\nconditions and ongoing\ninternal and external\nexamination processes.\nDue to the sensitivity\nof the ACL for loans to\nchanges in the economic\nand business\nenvironment, it is\npossible that we will\nincur incremental credit\nlosses not anticipated\nas of the balance sheet\ndate. Our process for\ndetermining the ACL is\ndiscussed in the\n\u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies \u2013 Allowance for\nCredit Losses\u201d section\nand Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial\nStatements in our 2022\nForm 10-K.\n\nMORTGAGE BANKING\nACTIVITIES We sell\nresidential and\ncommercial mortgage\nloans to various\nparties. In connection\nwith our sales and\nsecuritization of\nresidential mortgage\nloans, we have\nestablished a mortgage\nrepurchase liability.\nFor information on our\nrepurchase liability,\nsee the \u201cRisk Management\n\u2013 Credit Risk Management\n\u2013 Mortgage Banking\nActivities\u201d section in\nour 2022 Form 10-K.\n\nIn addition to servicing\nloans in our portfolio,\nwe act as servicer\nand/or master servicer\nof residential and\ncommercial mortgage\nloans included in GSE-\nguaranteed mortgage\nsecuritizations, GNMA-\nguaranteed mortgage\nsecuritizations of FHA-\ninsured/VA-guaranteed\nmortgages and private\nlabel mortgage\nsecuritizations, as well\nas for unsecuritized\nloans owned by\ninstitutional investors.\n\nAs a servicer, we are\nrequired to advance\ncertain delinquent\npayments of principal\nand interest on mortgage\nloans we service. The\namount and timing of\nreimbursement for\nadvances of delinquent\npayments vary by\ninvestor and the\napplicable servicing\nagreements. See Note 6\n(Mortgage Banking\nActivities) to Financial\nStatements in this\nReport for additional\ninformation about\nresidential and\ncommercial servicing\nrights, servicer\nadvances and servicing\nfees.\n\nIn accordance with\napplicable servicing\nguidelines, upon\ntransfer as servicer, we\nretain the option to\nrepurchase loans from\nGNMA loan securitization\npools, which generally\nbecomes exercisable when\nthree scheduled loan\npayments remain unpaid\nby the borrower. We may\nrepurchase these loans\nfor cash and as a\nresult, our total\nconsolidated assets do\nnot change. Repurchased\nloans that regain\ncurrent status or are\notherwise modified in\naccordance with\napplicable servicing\nguidelines may be\nincluded in future GNMA\nloan securitization\npools. At March 31,\n2023, and December 31,\n2022, these loans, which\nwe have repurchased or\nhave the option to\nrepurchase, were $9.3\nbillion and $9.8\nbillion, respectively,\nwhich included $8.3\nbillion and $8.6\nbillion, respectively,\nin loans held for\ninvestment, with the\nremainder in loans held\nfor sale. See\n\nNote 13 (Securitizations\nand Variable Interest\nEntities) to Financial\nStatements in this\nReport for additional\ninformation about our\ninvolvement with\nmortgage loan\nsecuritizations.\n\nFor additional\ninformation about the\nrisks related to our\nservicing activities,\nsee the \u201cRisk Management\n\u2013 Credit Risk Management\n\u2013 Mortgage Banking\nActivities\u201d section in\nour 2022 Form 10-K.

We are subject\nto interest rate risk\nbecause:\n\n\u2022 assets and liabilities\nmay mature or reprice at\ndifferent times. If\nassets reprice faster\nthan liabilities and\ninterest rates are\ngenerally rising,\nearnings will initially\nincrease;\n\n\u2022 assets and liabilities\nmay reprice at the same\ntime but by different\namounts;\n\n\u2022 short-term and long-\nterm market interest\nrates may change by\ndifferent amounts. For\nexample, the shape of\nthe yield curve may\naffect yield for new\nloans and funding costs\ndifferently;\n\n\u2022 the remaining maturity\nfor various assets or\nliabilities may shorten\nor lengthen as interest\nrates change. For\nexample, if long-term\nmortgage interest rates\nincrease sharply,\nmortgage-related\nproducts may pay down at\na slower rate than\nanticipated, which could\nimpact portfolio income;\nor\n\n\u2022 interest rates may\nhave a direct or\nindirect effect on loan\ndemand, collateral\nvalues, credit losses,\nmortgage origination\nvolume, and the fair\nvalue of MSRs and other\nfinancial instruments.\n\nWe assess interest rate\nrisk by comparing\noutcomes under various\nnet interest income\nsimulations using many\ninterest rate scenarios\nthat differ in the\ndirection of interest\nrate changes, the degree\nof change over time, the\nspeed of change and the\nprojected shape of the\nyield curve. These\nsimulations require\nassumptions regarding\ndrivers of earnings and\nbalance sheet\ncomposition such as loan\noriginations, prepayment\nrates on loans and debt\nsecurities, deposit\nflows and mix, as well\nas pricing strategies.\n\nOur most recent\nsimulations, as\npresented in Table 24,\nestimate net interest\nincome sensitivity over\nthe next 12 months using\ninstantaneous movements\nacross the yield curve\nwith both lower and\nhigher interest rates\nrelative to our base\nscenario. Steeper and\nflatter scenarios\nmeasure non-parallel\nchanges in the yield\ncurve, with long-term\ninterest rates defined\nas all tenors three\nyears and longer and\nshort-term interest\nrates defined as all\ntenors less than three\nyears. Where applicable,\nU.S. dollar interest\nrates are floored at\n0.00%. The following\ndescribes the simulation\nassumptions for the\nscenarios presented in\nTable 24:\n\n\u2022 Simulations are\ndynamic and reflect\nanticipated changes to\nour assets and\nliabilities.\n\n\u2022 Other macroeconomic\nvariables that could be\ncorrelated with the\nchanges in interest\nrates are held constant.\n\n\u2022 Mortgage prepayment\nand origination\nassumptions vary across\nscenarios and reflect\nonly the impact of the\nhigher or lower interest\nrates.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    37  \n                               \nRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement (continued)\n\n\u2022 Our base scenario\ndeposit forecast\nincorporates mix changes\nconsistent with the base\ninterest rate\ntrajectory. Deposit mix\nis modeled to be the\nsame in the base\nscenario and the\nalternative scenarios.\nIn higher interest rate\nscenarios, customer\ndeposit activity that\nshifts balances into\nhigher yielding products\ncould impact expected\nnet interest income. \u2022\nThe interest rate\nsensitivity of deposits\nis modeled using the\nhistorical behavior of\nour deposits portfolio\nand reflects the\nexpectations of deposit\nproducts repricing as\nmarket interest rates\nchange (referred to as\ndeposit betas). Our\nactual experience in\nbase and alternative\nscenarios may differ\nfrom expectations due to\nthe lag or acceleration\nof deposit repricing,\nchanges in consumer\nbehavior, and other\nfactors. \u2022 We hold the\nsize of the projected\ndebt and equity\nsecurities portfolios\nconstant across\nscenarios.

Our interest rate sensitivity\nindicates that we would expect to benefit from\nhigher interest rates as our assets would reprice\nfaster and to a greater degree than our\nliabilities, while in the case of lower interest\nrates, our assets would reprice downward and to a\ngreater degree than our liabilities resulting in\nlower net interest income. The sensitivity results\nabove do not capture noninterest income or expense\nimpacts. Our interest rate sensitive noninterest\nincome and expense are impacted by mortgage banking\nactivities that may have sensitivity impacts that\nmove in the opposite direction of our net interest\nincome. See the \u201cRisk Management \u2013 Asset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and\nMarket Risk\u201d section in our 2022 Form 10-K for\nadditional information. Interest rate sensitive\nnoninterest income is also impacted by changes in\nearnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits\nthat reduce treasury management deposit-related\nservice fees on commercial accounts, and by trading\nassets. In addition, the impact to net interest\nincome does not include the fair value changes of\ntrading securities, which, along with the effects\nof related economic hedges, are recorded in\nnoninterest income. In addition to changes in\ninterest rates, net interest income and noninterest\nincome from trading securities may be impacted by\nthe actual composition of the trading portfolio.\nFor additional information on our trading assets\nand liabilities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to\nFinancial Statements in this Report. We use the\ndebt securities portfolio and exchange-traded and\nover-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to\nmanage our interest rate exposures. As interest\nrates increase, changes in\n\nthe fair value of AFS debt securities may\nnegatively affect accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (AOCI), which lowers the amount of our\nregulatory capital. AOCI also includes unrealized\ngains or losses related to the transfer of debt\nsecurities from AFS to HTM, which are subsequently\namortized into earnings over the life of the\nsecurity with no further impact from interest rate\nchanges. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale\nand Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial\nStatements in this Report for additional\ninformation on the debt securities portfolios. We\nuse derivatives for asset/liability management in\nthe following main ways: \u2022 to convert the cash\nflows from selected asset and/or liability\ninstruments/portfolios including certain interest-\nearning deposits, commercial loans and long-term\ndebt, from floating-rate payments to fixed-rate\npayments, or vice versa; \u2022 to reduce AOCI\nsensitivity of our AFS debt securities portfolio;\nand \u2022 to economically hedge our mortgage\norigination pipeline, funded mortgage loans, and\nMSRs. Derivatives used to hedge our interest rate\nrisk exposures are presented in Note 14\n(Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this\nReport. MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET\nRISK We originate, fund and service mortgage loans,\nwhich subjects us to various risks, including\nmarket, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks\nthat can be substantial. Based on market conditions\nand other factors, we reduce credit and liquidity\nrisks by selling or securitizing mortgage loans. We\ndetermine whether mortgage loans will be held for\ninvestment or held for sale at the time of\ncommitment, but may change our intent to hold loans\nfor investment or sale as part of our corporate\nasset/liability management activities. We may also\nretain securities in our investment portfolio at\nthe time we securitize mortgage loans. Changes in\ninterest rates may impact mortgage banking\nnoninterest income, including origination and\nservicing fees, and the fair value of our\nresidential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan\ncommitments (interest rate \u201clocks\u201d) extended to\nmortgage applicants. Interest rate changes will\ngenerally impact our mortgage banking noninterest\nincome on a lagging basis due to the time it takes\nfor the market to reflect a shift in customer\ndemand, as well as the time required for processing\na new application, providing the commitment, and\nsecuritizing and selling the loan. The amount and\ntiming of the impact will depend on the magnitude,\nspeed and duration of the changes in interest\nrates. For additional information on mortgage\nbanking, including key assumptions and the\nsensitivity of the fair value of MSRs, see the\n\u201cRisk Management \u2013 Asset/Liability Management \u2013\nMortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk\u201d\nsection and Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities),\nNote 11 (Derivatives), and Note 12 (Fair Values of\nAssets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in\nour 2022 Form 10-K. MARKET RISK Market risk is the\nrisk of possible economic loss from adverse changes\nin market risk factors such as interest rates,\ncredit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and\ncommodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due\nto counterparty exposure. This applies to implied\nvolatility risk, basis risk, and market liquidity\nrisk. It includes price risk in the trading book,\nmortgage servicing rights and the hedge\neffectiveness risk associated with mortgage loans\nheld at fair value, and impairment of private\nequity investments.

Debt securities\nheld for trading, equity\nsecurities held for\ntrading, trading loans\nand trading derivatives\nare financial\ninstruments used in our\ntrading activities, and\nall are carried at fair\nvalue. Income earned on\nthe financial\ninstruments used in our\ntrading activities\ninclude net interest\nincome, changes in fair\nvalue and realized gains\nand losses. Net interest\nincome earned from our\ntrading activities is\nreflected in the\ninterest income and\ninterest expense\ncomponents of our\nconsolidated statement\nof income. Changes in\nfair value of the\nfinancial instruments\nused in our trading\nactivities are reflected\nin net gains from\ntrading activities. For\nadditional information\non the financial\ninstruments used in our\ntrading activities and\nthe income from these\ntrading activities,\n\nsee Note 2 (Trading\nActivities) to Financial\nStatements in this\nReport.\n\nValue-at-risk (VaR) is a\nstatistical risk measure\nused to estimate the\npotential loss from\nadverse moves in the\nfinancial markets. The\nCompany uses VaR metrics\ncomplemented with\nsensitivity analysis and\nstress testing in\nmeasuring and monitoring\nmarket risk. For\nadditional information\non our monitoring\nactivities, sensitivity\nanalysis and stress\ntesting, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Market Risk\n\u2013 Trading Activities\u201d\nsection in our 2022 Form\n10-K.\n\nTrading VaR is the\nmeasure used to provide\ninsight into the market\nrisk exhibited by the\nCompany\u2019s trading\npositions. The Company\ncalculates Trading VaR\nfor risk management\npurposes to establish\nline of business and\nCompany-wide risk\nlimits. Trading VaR is\ncalculated based on all\ntrading positions on our\nconsolidated balance\nsheet.\n\nTable 25 shows the\nCompany\u2019s Trading\nGeneral VaR by risk\ncategory. The increase\nin average Company\nTrading General VaR for\nthe quarter ended March\n31, 2023, compared with\nthe same period a year\nago, was primarily\ndriven by changes in\nportfolio composition.\n\nTable 25: Trading 1-Day\n99% General VaR by Risk\nCategory\n                                                   \n                                                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n(1) The period-end VaR\nwas less than the sum of\nthe VaR components\ndescribed above, which\nis due to portfolio\ndiversification. The\ndiversification effect\narises because the risks\nare not perfectly\ncorrelated causing a\nportfolio of positions\nto usually be less risky\nthan the sum of the\nrisks of the positions\nalone. The\ndiversification benefit\nis not meaningful for\nlow and high metrics\nsince they may occur on\ndifferent days.\n\nMARKET RISK \u2013 EQUITY\nSECURITIES We are\ndirectly and indirectly\naffected by changes in\nthe equity markets. We\nmake and manage direct\ninvestments in start-up\nbusinesses, emerging\ngrowth companies,\nmanagement buy-outs,\nacquisitions and\ncorporate\nrecapitalizations. We\nalso invest in non-\naffiliated funds that\nmake similar private\nequity investments. For\nadditional information,\nsee the \u201cRisk Management\n\u2013 Asset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Market Risk\n\u2013 Equity Securities\u201d\nsection in our 2022 Form\n10-K.\n\nWe also have marketable\nequity securities that\ninclude investments\nrelating to our venture\ncapital activities. The\nfair value changes in\nthese marketable equity\nsecurities are\nrecognized in net\nincome. For additional\ninformation, see Note 4\n(Equity Securities) to\nFinancial Statements in\nthis Report.\n\nChanges in equity market\nprices may also\nindirectly affect our\nnet income by (1) the\nvalue of third-party\nassets under management\nand, hence, fee income,\n(2) borrowers whose\nability to repay\nprincipal and/or\ninterest may be affected\nby the stock market, or\n(3) brokerage activity,\nrelated commission\nincome and other\nbusiness activities.\nEach business line\nmonitors and manages\nthese indirect risks.\n\nLIQUIDITY RISK AND\nFUNDING Liquidity risk\nis the risk arising from\nthe inability of the\nCompany to meet\nobligations when they\ncome due, or roll over\nfunds at a reasonable\ncost, without\n\nincurring heightened\ncosts. In the ordinary\ncourse of business, we\nenter into contractual\nobligations that may\nrequire future cash\npayments, including\nfunding for customer\nloan requests, customer\ndeposit maturities and\nwithdrawals, debt\nservice, leases for\npremises and equipment,\nand other cash\ncommitments. Liquidity\nrisk also considers the\nstability of deposits,\nincluding the risk of\nlosing uninsured or non-\noperational deposits.\nThe objective of\neffective liquidity\nmanagement is to ensure\nthat we can meet our\ncontractual obligations\nand other cash\ncommitments efficiently\nunder both normal\noperating conditions and\nunder periods of Wells\nFargo-specific and/or\nmarket stress.\n\nTo help achieve this\nobjective, the Board\nestablishes liquidity\nguidelines that require\nsufficient asset-based\nliquidity to cover\npotential funding\nrequirements and to\navoid over-dependence on\nvolatile, less reliable\nfunding markets. These\nguidelines are monitored\non a monthly basis by\nthe management-level\nCorporate\nAsset/Liability\nCommittee and on a\nquarterly basis by the\nBoard. These guidelines\nare established and\nmonitored for both the\nCompany and the Parent\non a stand-alone basis\nso that the Parent is a\nsource of strength for\nits banking\nsubsidiaries. For\nadditional information\non liquidity risk and\nfunding management, see\nthe \u201cRisk Management \u2013\nLiquidity Risk and\nFunding\u201d section in our\n2022 Form 10-K.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    39  \n                               \nRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement (continued)\n\nLiquidity Standards We\nare subject to a rule\nissued by the FRB, OCC\nand FDIC that\nestablishes a\nquantitative minimum\nliquidity requirement\nconsistent with the\nliquidity coverage ratio\n(LCR) established by the\nBasel Committee on\nBanking Supervision\n(BCBS). The rule\nrequires a covered\nbanking organization to\nhold high-quality liquid\nassets (HQLA) in an\namount equal to or\ngreater than its\nprojected net cash\noutflows during a 30-day\nstress period. Our HQLA\nunder the rule\npredominantly consists\nof central bank\ndeposits, government\ndebt securities, and\nmortgage-backed\nsecurities of federal\nagencies. The LCR\napplies to the Company\nand to our insured\ndepository institutions\n(IDIs) with total assets\nof $10 billion or more.\nIn addition, rules\nissued by the FRB impose\nenhanced liquidity risk\nmanagement standards on\nlarge bank holding\ncompanies (BHCs), such\nas Wells Fargo.\n\nThe FRB, OCC and FDIC\nhave also issued a rule\nimplementing a stable\nfunding requirement,\nknown as the net stable\nfunding ratio (NSFR),\nwhich requires a covered\nbanking organization,\nsuch\n\nas Wells Fargo, to\nmaintain a minimum\namount of stable\nfunding, including\ncommon equity, long-term\ndebt and most types of\ndeposits, in relation to\nits assets, derivative\nexposures and\ncommitments over a one-\nyear horizon period.

Our\nprimary sources\n\nof liquidity are\npresented in Table 27 at\nfair value, which also\nincludes encumbered\nsecurities that are not\nincluded as available\nHQLA in the calculation\nof the LCR.\n\nOur cash is\npredominantly on deposit\nwith the Federal\nReserve. We believe the\ndebt securities included\nin Table 27 provide\nquick and reliable\nsources of liquidity\nthrough sales or by\npledging to obtain\nfinancing, regardless of\nmarket conditions.

Risk-based\ncapital rules establish\nrisk-adjusted ratios\nrelating regulatory\ncapital to different\ncategories of assets and\noff-balance sheet\nexposures as discussed\nbelow.\n\nRISK-BASED CAPITAL AND\nRISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS The\nCompany is subject to\nrules issued by federal\nbanking regulators to\nimplement Basel III\ncapital requirements for\nU.S. banking\norganizations. The rules\ncontain two frameworks\nfor calculating capital\nrequirements, a\nStandardized Approach\nand an Advanced Approach\napplicable to certain\ninstitutions, including\nWells Fargo, and we must\ncalculate our risk-based\ncapital ratios under\nboth approaches. The\nCompany is required to\nsatisfy the risk-based\ncapital ratio\nrequirements to avoid\nrestrictions on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary bonus\npayments. Table 31 and\nTable 32 present the\nrisk-based capital\nrequirements applicable\nto the Company under the\nStandardized Approach\nand Advanced Approach,\nrespectively, as of\nMarch 31, 2023.\n\nTable 31: Risk-Based\nCapital Requirements \u2013\nStandardized Approach as\nof March 31, 2023\n\nTable 32: Risk-Based\nCapital Requirements \u2013\nAdvanced Approach as of\nMarch 31, 2023\n\nIn addition to the risk-\nbased capital\nrequirements described\nin Table 31 and Table\n32, if the FRB\ndetermines that a period\nof excessive credit\ngrowth is contributing\nto an increase in\nsystemic risk, a\ncountercyclical buffer\nof up to 2.50% could be\nadded to the risk-based\ncapital ratio\nrequirements under\nfederal banking\nregulations. The\ncountercyclical buffer\nin effect at March 31,\n2023, was 0.00%.\n\nThe capital conservation\nbuffer is applicable to\ncertain institutions,\nincluding Wells Fargo,\nunder the Advanced\nApproach and is intended\nto absorb losses during\ntimes of economic or\nfinancial stress.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    43  \n                               \n                                                   \n  Capital Management(continued)                    \n                                                   \nThe stress capital\nbuffer is calculated\nbased on the decrease in\na BHC\u2019s risk-based\ncapital ratios under the\nseverely adverse\nscenario in the FRB\u2019s\nannual supervisory\nstress test and related\nComprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review\n(CCAR), plus four\nquarters of planned\ncommon stock dividends.\nBecause the stress\ncapital buffer is\ncalculated annually\nbased on data that can\ndiffer over time, our\nstress capital buffer,\nand thus our risk-based\ncapital ratio\nrequirements under the\nStandardized Approach,\nare subject to change in\nfuture periods. Our\nstress capital buffer\nfor the period October\n1, 2022, through\nSeptember 30, 2023, is\n3.20%.\n\nAs a global systemically\nimportant bank (G-SIB),\nwe are also subject to\nthe FRB\u2019s rule\nimplementing an\nadditional capital\nsurcharge between\n1.00-4.50% on the risk-\nbased capital ratio\nrequirements of G-SIBs.\nUnder the rule, we must\nannually calculate our\nsurcharge under two\nmethods and use the\nhigher\n\nof the two surcharges.\nThe first method (method\none) considers our size,\ninterconnectedness,\ncross-jurisdictional\nactivity,\nsubstitutability, and\ncomplexity, consistent\nwith the methodology\ndeveloped by the BCBS\nand the Financial\nStability Board (FSB).\nThe second method\n(method two) uses\nsimilar inputs, but\nreplaces\nsubstitutability with\nuse of short-term\n\nwholesale funding and\nwill generally result in\nhigher surcharges than\nunder method one.\nBecause the G-SIB\ncapital surcharge is\ncalculated annually\nbased on data that can\ndiffer over time, the\namount of the surcharge\nis subject to change in\nfuture years. If our\nannual calculation\nresults in a decrease to\nour G-SIB capital\nsurcharge, the decrease\ntakes effect the next\ncalendar year. If our\nannual calculation\nresults in an increase\nto our G-SIB capital\nsurcharge, the increase\ntakes effect in two\ncalendar years. Our\n\nG-SIB capital surcharge\nwill continue to be\n1.50% in 2023.\n\nUnder the risk-based\ncapital rules, on-\nbalance sheet assets and\ncredit equivalent\namounts of derivatives\nand off-balance sheet\nitems are assigned to\none of several broad\nrisk categories\naccording to the\nobligor, or, if\nrelevant, the guarantor\nor the nature of any\ncollateral. The\naggregate dollar amount\nin each risk category is\nthen multiplied by the\nrisk weight associated\nwith that category. The\nresulting weighted\nvalues from each of the\nrisk categories are\naggregated for\ndetermining total risk-\nweighted assets (RWAs).\n\nThe tables that follow\nprovide information\nabout our risk-based\ncapital and related\nratios as calculated\nunder Basel III capital\nrules.

We adopted this\nASU with retrospective\napplication, which\nrequired revision of\nprior period financial\nstatements.

The rule\npermits certain banking\norganizations to exclude\nfrom regulatory capital\nthe initial adoption\nimpact of CECL, plus 25%\nof the cumulative\nchanges in the allowance\nfor credit losses (ACL)\nunder CECL for each\nperiod until December\n31, 2021, followed by a\nthree-year phase-out\nperiod in which the\nbenefit is reduced by\n25% in year one, 50% in\nyear two and 75% in year\nthree.\n\n(4) Differences between\nthe approaches are\ndriven by the qualifying\namounts of ACL\nincludable in Tier 2\ncapital. Under the\nAdvanced Approach,\neligible credit reserves\nrepresented by the\namount of qualifying ACL\nin excess of expected\ncredit losses (using\nregulatory definitions)\nis limited to 0.60% of\nAdvanced credit RWAs,\nwhereas the Standardized\nApproach includes ACL in\nTier 2 capital up to\n1.25% of Standardized\ncredit RWAs. Under both\napproaches, any excess\nACL is deducted from the\nrespective total RWAs.\n\nTable 35 provides the\ncomposition of our RWAs\nunder the Standardized\nand Advanced Approaches.\n\nTable 35:

Tangible common\nequity is a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure and\nrepresents total equity\nless preferred equity,\nnoncontrolling\ninterests, goodwill,\ncertain identifiable\nintangible assets (other\nthan MSRs) and goodwill\nand other intangibles on\ninvestments in\nconsolidated portfolio\ncompanies, net of\napplicable deferred\ntaxes. The ratios are\n(i) tangible book value\nper common share, which\nrepresents tangible\ncommon equity divided by\ncommon shares\noutstanding; and (ii)\nreturn on average\ntangible common\n\nequity (ROTCE), which\nrepresents our\nannualized earnings as a\npercentage of tangible\ncommon equity. The\nmethodology of\ndetermining tangible\ncommon equity may differ\namong companies.\nManagement believes that\ntangible book value per\ncommon share and return\non average tangible\ncommon equity, which\nutilize tangible common\nequity, are useful\nfinancial measures\nbecause they enable\nmanagement, investors,\nand others to assess the\nCompany\u2019s use of equity.\n\nTable 38 provides a\nreconciliation of these\nnon-GAAP financial\nmeasures to GAAP\nfinancial measures.\n                                                   \n  Table 38:                                        \n                                                   \n                                                   \n  Tangible Common Equity                           \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                         \u2026                         \n                         \u2026                         \n                         \u2026                         \n                         \u2026                         \n                         \u2026                         \n                         \u2026                         \n                         \u2026                         \n                         \u2026                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n                                \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                \u2014      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n                                \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n(1) In fourth quarter\n2022, we redeemed all\noutstanding shares of\nour Employee Stock\nOwnership Plan (ESOP)\nCumulative Convertible\nPreferred Stock in\nexchange for shares of\nthe Company's common\nstock.

As\nof March 31, 2023, these\nbroker-dealer\nsubsidiaries were in\ncompliance with their\nrespective regulatory\nminimum net capital\nrequirements. Capital\nPlanning and Stress\nTesting Our planned\nlong-term capital\nstructure is designed to\nmeet regulatory and\nmarket expectations. We\nbelieve that our long-\nterm targeted capital\nstructure enables us to\ninvest in and grow our\nbusiness, satisfy our\ncustomers\u2019 financial\nneeds in varying\nenvironments, access\nmarkets, and maintain\nflexibility to return\ncapital to our\nshareholders. Our long-\nterm targeted capital\nstructure also considers\ncapital levels\nsufficient to exceed\ncapital requirements,\nincluding the G-SIB\ncapital surcharge and\nthe stress capital\nbuffer, as well as\npotential changes to\nregulatory requirements\nfor our capital ratios,\nplanned capital actions,\nchanges in our risk\nprofile and other\nfactors. Accordingly,\nour long-term target\ncapital levels are set\nabove their respective\nregulatory minimums plus\nbuffers. The FRB capital\nplan rule establishes\ncapital planning and\nother requirements that\ngovern capital\ndistributions, including\ndividends and share\nrepurchases, by certain\nBHCs, including Wells\nFargo. The FRB assesses,\namong other things, the\noverall financial\ncondition, risk profile,\nand capital adequacy of\nBHCs when evaluating\ntheir capital plans. We\nsubmitted our 2023\ncapital plan to the FRB\nprior to the April 5,\n2023, deadline. As part\nof the annual\nComprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review, the\nFRB generates a\nsupervisory stress test.\nThe FRB reviews the\nsupervisory stress test\nresults as required\nunder the Dodd-Frank Act\nusing a common set of\ncapital actions for all\nlarge BHCs and also\nreviews the Company\u2019s\nproposed capital\nactions. The FRB has\nindicated it will\npublish its supervisory\nstress test results by\nJune 30, 2023. Federal\nbanking regulators also\nrequire large BHCs and\nbanks to conduct their\nown stress tests to\nevaluate whether the\ninstitution has\nsufficient capital to\ncontinue to operate\nduring periods of\nadverse economic and\nfinancial conditions.\n                               \n  48    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \n                                                   \n  Securities Repurchases                           \n                                                   \nFrom time to time the\nBoard authorizes the\nCompany to repurchase\nshares of our common\nstock. Although we\nannounce when the Board\nauthorizes share\nrepurchases, we\ntypically do not give\nany public notice before\nwe repurchase our\nshares. Various factors\ndetermine the amount of\nour share repurchases,\nincluding our capital\nrequirements, the number\nof shares we expect to\nissue for employee\nbenefit plans and any\nacquisitions, market\nconditions (including\nthe trading price of our\nstock), and regulatory\nand legal\nconsiderations,\nincluding under the\nFRB\u2019s capital plan rule.\nDue to the various\nfactors that may impact\nthe\n\namount of our share\nrepurchases and the fact\nthat we tend to be in\nthe market regularly to\nsatisfy repurchase\nconsiderations under our\ncapital plan, our share\nrepurchases occur at\nvarious price levels. We\nmay suspend share\nrepurchase activity at\nany time.\n\nAt March 31, 2023, we\nhad remaining Board\nauthority to repurchase\napproximately 164\nmillion shares, subject\nto regulatory and legal\nconditions.

Such unavailable\ninformation could be significant to future results.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    53  \n                               \n                \n  Risk Factors  \n                \nAn investment in the\nCompany involves risk,\nincluding the\npossibility that the\nvalue of the investment\ncould fall substantially\nand that dividends or\nother distributions on\nthe investment could be\nreduced or eliminated.\nFor a discussion of risk\nfactors that could\nadversely affect our\nfinancial results and\ncondition, and the value\nof, and return on, an\ninvestment in the\nCompany, we refer you to\nthe \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nsection in our 2022 Form\n10-K.\n                               \n  54    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \n                           \n  Controls and Procedures  \n                           \n                                      \n  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  \n                                      \nThe Company\u2019s management evaluated the\neffectiveness, as of March 31, 2023, of the\nCompany\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures. The\nCompany\u2019s chief executive officer and chief\nfinancial officer participated in the evaluation.\nBased on this evaluation, the Company\u2019s chief\nexecutive officer and chief financial officer\nconcluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures were effective as of March 31, 2023.\n                                             \n  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  \n                                             \nInternal control over financial reporting is\ndefined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process\ndesigned by, or under the supervision of, the\nCompany\u2019s principal executive and principal\nfinancial officers and effected by the Company\u2019s\nBoard, management and other personnel, to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (GAAP) and includes those policies and\nprocedures that:\n\n\u2022 pertain to the maintenance of records that in\nreasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of assets of the\nCompany;\n\n\u2022 provide reasonable assurance that transactions\nare recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with GAAP, and\nthat receipts and expenditures of the Company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations\nof management and directors of the Company; and\n\n\u2022 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention\nor timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,\nuse or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that\ncould have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not prevent or\ndetect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to\nthe risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. No change occurred\nduring first quarter 2023 that has materially\naffected, or is reasonably likely to materially\naffect, the Company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\n

We provide banking, investment\nand mortgage products and services, as well as\nconsumer and commercial finance, through banking\nlocations and offices, the internet and other\ndistribution channels to individuals, businesses\nand institutions in all 50 states, the District of\nColumbia, and in countries outside the U.S. When we\nrefer to \u201cWells Fargo,\u201d \u201cthe Company,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d\nor \u201cus,\u201d we mean Wells Fargo & Company and\nSubsidiaries (consolidated). Wells Fargo & Company\n(the Parent) is a financial holding company and a\nbank holding company. We also hold a majority\ninterest in a real estate investment trust, which\nhas publicly traded preferred stock outstanding.\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform with\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP) and practices in the financial services\nindustry. For discussion of our significant\naccounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2022 (2022 Form 10-K). There were no material\nchanges to these policies in first quarter 2023. To\nprepare the financial statements in conformity with\nGAAP, management must make estimates based on\nassumptions about future economic and market\nconditions (for example, unemployment, market\nliquidity, real estate prices, etc.) that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities at\nthe date of the financial statements, income and\nexpenses during the reporting period and the\nrelated disclosures. Although our estimates\ncontemplate current conditions and how we expect\nthem to change in the future, it is reasonably\npossible that actual conditions could be worse than\nanticipated in those estimates, which could\nmaterially affect our results of operations and\nfinancial condition. Management has made\nsignificant estimates in several areas, including:\n\u2022 allowance for credit losses (Note 5 (Loans and\nRelated Allowance for Credit Losses)); \u2022 valuations\nof residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)\n(Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 13\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities));\n\u2022 valuations of financial instruments (Note 12\n(Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities)); \u2022\nliabilities for contingent litigation losses (Note\n10 (Legal Actions)); \u2022 income taxes; and \u2022 goodwill\nimpairment (Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other\nAssets)). Actual results could differ from those\nestimates. These unaudited interim financial\nstatements reflect all adjustments that are, in the\nopinion of management, necessary for a fair\nstatement of the results for the periods presented.\nThese adjustments are of a normal recurring nature,\nunless otherwise disclosed in this Form 10-Q. The\nresults of operations in the interim financial\nstatements do not necessarily indicate the results\nthat may be expected for the full year. The interim\nfinancial information should be read in conjunction\nwith our 2022 Form 10-K. Accounting Standards\nAdopted in 2023 In 2023, we adopted the following\nnew accounting guidance: \u2022 Accounting Standards\nUpdate (ASU) 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit\nLosses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings\nand Vintage Disclosures \u2022 ASU 2022-01, Derivatives\nand Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging \u2013\nPortfolio Layer Method \u2022 ASU 2021-08, Business\nCombinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract\nAssets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with\nCustomers \u2022 ASU 2018-12, Financial Services \u2013\nInsurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the\nAccounting for Long-Duration Contracts and\nsubsequent related updates ASU 2022-02 eliminates\nthe accounting and reporting for troubled debt\nrestructurings (TDRs) by creditors and introduces\nnew required disclosures for loan modifications\nmade to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty. The new required disclosures include\ninformation about modifications granted to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the\nform of principal forgiveness, interest rate\nreductions, other-than-insignificant payment\ndelays, term extensions, or a combination of these\nmodifications. The ASU also requires new\ndisclosures for the financial effects of these\nmodifications and for loan performance in the\ntwelve months following the modification. The\nUpdate also amends the guidance for vintage\ndisclosures to require disclosure of current period\ngross charge-offs by year of origination. See Note\n5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses)\nfor additional information related to the new\ndisclosures for loan modifications to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty and for gross\ncharge-offs by year of origination, which are\nprovided on a prospective basis. The Update\neliminates the requirement to use a discounted cash\nflow (DCF) approach to measure the allowance for\ncredit losses (ACL) for TDRs and instead allows for\nthe use of a current expected credit loss approach\nfor all loans. Under a current expected credit loss\napproach, the impact of loan modifications and the\nsubsequent performance of modified loans, including\ndefaults, is reflected in the historical loss data\nused to calculate expected lifetime credit losses.\nUpon adoption on January 1, 2023, we discontinued\nutilizing a DCF approach to measure credit\nimpairment for consumer loans and certain\ncommercial loans previously modified in a TDR and\nwe removed the interest concession component\nrecognized in the ACL. We elected to apply the\nmodified-retrospective transition approach method,\nresulting in a cumulative effect adjustment to\nretained earnings upon adoption, which reflects the\ndifference between the pre-modification and post-\nmodification effective interest rates that would\nhave been recognized over the remaining life of the\nloans as interest income. Upon adoption, we\nrecognized a decrease in our ACL of $ 429million,\npre-tax, and an increase to our retained earnings\nof $ 323million, after tax. We continue to use a\nDCF approach for certain non-accruing, non-\ncollateral dependent commercial loans. ASU 2022-01\nestablishes the portfolio layer method, which\nexpands an entity's ability to achieve fair value\nhedge accounting for interest rate risk hedges of\nclosed portfolios of financial assets. The Update\nalso provides guidance on the accounting for hedged\nitem basis adjustments under the portfolio layer\nmethod.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    61  \n                               \nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n(continued)\n\nWe adopted ASU 2022-01 on January 1, 2023 on a\nprospective basis. No cumulative effect adjustment\nto the opening balance of stockholders\u2019 equity was\nrequired upon adoption, as impacts to us were\nreflected prospectively. The portfolio layer method\nimproves our ability to use derivatives to hedge\ninterest rate risk exposures associated with\nportfolios of financial assets, such as fixed-rate\navailable-for-sale (AFS) debt securities and loans.\nThe Update allows us to hedge a larger proportion\nof these portfolios by expanding the number and\ntype of derivatives permitted as eligible hedges,\nas well as by increasing the scope of eligible\nhedged items to include both prepayable and\nnonprepayable assets. Unlike other fair value\nhedging relationships where basis adjustments\nadjust the carrying amount of the individual hedged\nitem, basis adjustments related to active portfolio\nlayer method hedges are maintained at a portfolio\nlevel and not allocated to the individual assets in\nthe portfolio. Upon adoption, any election to\ndesignate portfolio layer method hedges is applied\nprospectively. Additionally, the Update permits a\none-time reclassification of debt securities from\nheld-to-maturity (HTM) to AFS classification as\nlong as the securities are designated in a\nportfolio layer method hedge no later than 30 days\nafter the adoption date. In January 2023, we\nreclassified fixed-rate debt securities with an\naggregate fair value of $ 23.2billion and amortized\ncost of $ 23.9billion from HTM to AFS and\ndesignated interest rate swaps with notional\namounts of $ 20.1billion as fair value hedges using\nthe portfolio layer method. The transfer of debt\nsecurities was recorded at fair value and resulted\nin approximately $ 566million of unrealized losses\nassociated with AFS debt securities being recorded\nto other comprehensive income, net of deferred\ntaxes. See Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\nMaturity Debt Securities) for additional\ninformation about the Company's portfolio layer\nmethod hedge basis adjustments and HTM to AFS\ntransfers in connection with adoption of the Update\nand Note 11 (Derivatives) for disclosures regarding\nour portfolio layer method hedging relationships.\nASU 2021-08 amends Accounting Standards\nCodification (ASC) 805 \u2013 Business Combinations to\nrequire entities to recognize and measure contract\nassets and contract liabilities in a business\ncombination in accordance with ASC 606 \u2013 Revenue\nRecognition. Prior to ASU 2021-08, there was\ndiversity in practice related to recognition\ntreatment, and acquirers generally measured such\nitems at acquisition date fair value. We adopted\nthis Update prospectively on January 1, 2023. This\nUpdate did not have a material impact to our\nconsolidated financial statements. ASU 2018-12\nchanges the accounting for long-duration insurance\ncontracts or contract features that provide\nbenefits to the policyholder in addition to the\npolicyholder\u2019s account value. These features, which\nthe ASU defines as market risk benefits, protect\nthe policyholder to some degree from capital\nmarkets risk and expose the insurer or reinsurer to\nthat risk. The ASU requires all market risk\nbenefits to be measured at fair value through\nearnings with changes in fair value attributable to\nour own credit risk recognized in other\ncomprehensive income. We reinsure certain variable\nannuity products for a limited number of insurance\nclients with guaranteed minimum benefits which are\naccounted for as market risk benefits under the\nASU. Our reinsurance business is no longer entering\ninto new contracts. We utilize a discounted cash\nflow model to value our market risk benefits.\nMarket risk benefits are level 3 fair value\nliabilities because they are valued using\nsignificant unobservable inputs. The fair value of\nour market risk benefits is sensitive to changes in\nfixed income and equity markets, as well as\npolicyholder behavior (e.g., withdrawals, lapses,\nutilization rate) and changes in mortality\nassumptions. Beginning first quarter 2023, we use\nderivative instruments, where feasible, to\neconomically hedge the interest rate and equity\nmarkets volatility. The fair value of market risk\nbenefits is measured at the contract level and is\nrecognized in accrued expenses and other\nliabilities. We recognize changes in fair value for\nour market risk benefits, excluding the change in\nfair value related to our own credit risk, in\nnoninterest income along with the changes in fair\nvalue of economic hedges. Changes in fair value\nattributable to our own credit risk are recorded in\nother comprehensive income. Upon adoption on\nJanuary 1, 2023, as required under the ASU, we\nimplemented the accounting changes for market risk\nbenefits retrospectively, to the earliest period\npresented, which resulted in an after-tax\ncumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained\nearnings and accumulated other comprehensive income\nby $ 176million and $ 44million, respectively, as\nof January 1, 2022. The ASU also requires more\nfrequent updates for insurance assumptions,\nmandates the use of a standardized discount rate\nfor traditional long-duration contracts, and\nsimplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition\ncosts. The accounting changes for the liability of\nfuture policyholder benefits for traditional long-\nduration contracts (included in accrued expenses\nand other liabilities) and deferred acquisition\ncosts (included in other assets) did not have a\nmaterial impact upon adoption. Table 1.1 presents\nthe impact of adoption to prior period financial\nstatement line items within our consolidated\nstatement of income and consolidated balance sheet\nfor the quarter ended March 31, 2022, and as of\nDecember 31, 2022. These adjustments are also\nreflected in our consolidated statement of changes\nin equity and consolidated statement of cash flows.\n                               \n  62    Wells Fargo & Company  \n

The\ncredit quality indicators that we most closely\nmonitor include credit ratings and delinquency\nstatus and are based on information as of our\nfinancial statement date. CREDIT RATINGS Credit\nratings express opinions about the credit quality\nof a debt security. We determine the credit rating\nof a security according to the lowest credit rating\nmade available by national recognized statistical\nrating organizations (NRSROs). Debt securities\nrated investment grade, that is those with ratings\nsimilar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as defined by\nNRSROs, are generally considered by the rating\nagencies and market participants to be low credit\nrisk. Conversely, debt securities rated below\ninvestment grade, labeled as \u201cspeculative grade\u201d by\nthe rating agencies, are considered to be\ndistinctively higher credit risk than investment\ngrade debt securities. For debt securities not\nrated by NRSROs, we determine an internal credit\ngrade of the debt securities (used for credit risk\nmanagement purposes) equivalent to the credit\nratings assigned by major credit agencies.\nSubstantially all of our debt securities were rated\nby NRSROs at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022.\nTable 3.4 shows the percentage of fair value of AFS\ndebt securities and

NONACCRUAL DEBT SECURITIES\nDebt security issuers that are delinquent in\npayment of amounts due under contractual debt\nagreements have a higher probability of recognition\nof credit losses. As such, as part of our\nmonitoring of the credit quality of the debt\nsecurity portfolio, we consider whether debt\nsecurities we own are past due in payment of\nprincipal or interest payments and whether any\nsecurities have been placed into nonaccrual status.\nDebt securities that are past due and still\naccruing or in nonaccrual status were insignificant\nat both March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. Net\ncharge-offs on debt securities were insignificant\nin the first quarter of both 2023 and 2022.\nPurchased debt securities with credit deterioration\n(PCD) are not considered to be in nonaccrual\nstatus, as payments from issuers of these\nsecurities remain current. PCD securities were\ninsignificant in the first quarter of both 2023 and\n2022.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    67  \n                               \nNote 3: Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity\nDebt Securities (continued)\n\nUnrealized Losses of Available-for-Sale Debt\nSecurities Table 3.5 shows the gross unrealized\nlosses and fair value of AFS debt securities by\nlength of time those individual securities in each\ncategory have been in a continuous loss position.\nDebt securities on which we have recorded credit\nimpairment are categorized as being \u201cless than 12\nmonths\u201d or \u201c12 months or more\u201d in a continuous loss\nposition based on the point in time that the fair\nvalue declined to below the amortized cost basis,\nnet of allowance for credit losses.\n\nTable 3.5: Gross Unrealized Losses and Fair Value \u2013\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities\n                                                   \n                 \u2026               12                \n                 \u2026               m\u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       or    \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       m\u2026    \u2026        \u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       F\u2026    \u2026        \u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       v\u2026    \u2026        \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                   \n      $  \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    4\u2026     \n         \u2014    \u2014       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    63     \n         \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    1\u2026     \n         \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    5\u2026     \n         \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    3\u2026     \n         \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    3\u2026     \n         \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    1\u2026     \n      $  \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    1\u2026     \n                                                   \n                                                   \n      $  \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    3\u2026     \n         \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    4\u2026     \n         \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    4\u2026     \n         \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    3\u2026     \n         \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    3\u2026     \n         \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    2\u2026     \n      $  \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026    9\u2026     \n                                                   \n(1) Excludes portfolio level basis adjustments.\n\nWe have assessed each debt security with gross\nunrealized losses included in the previous table\nfor credit impairment.

We also\noriginate multipurpose\nlending commitments\nunder which commercial\ncustomers have the\noption to draw on the\nfacility in one of\nseveral forms, including\nthe issuance of letters\nof credit, which reduces\nthe unfunded commitment\namounts of the facility.\nThe maximum credit risk\nfor these commitments\nwill generally be lower\nthan the contractual\namount because these\ncommitments may expire\nwithout being used or\nmay be cancelled at the\ncustomer\u2019s request. We\nmay reduce or cancel\nlines of credit in\naccordance with the\ncontracts and applicable\nlaw. Our credit risk\nmonitoring activities\ninclude managing the\namount of commitments,\nboth to individual\ncustomers and in total,\nand the size and\nmaturity structure of\nthese commitments. We do\nnot recognize an ACL for\ncommitments that are\nunconditionally\ncancellable at our\ndiscretion. We issue\ncommercial letters of\ncredit to assist\ncustomers in purchasing\ngoods or services,\ntypically for\ninternational trade.

Any advances\nare generally repaid in\nless than a week and\nwould normally require\ndefault of both the\ncustomer and another\nlender to expose us to\nloss.\nThe contractual amount\nof our unfunded credit\ncommitments, including\nunissued letters of\ncredit, is summarized in\nTable 5.4.

Loan delinquency, Fair Isaac\nCorporation (FICO) credit scores and loan-to-value\n(LTV) for residential mortgage loans are the\nprimary credit quality indicators that we monitor\nand utilize in our evaluation of the\nappropriateness of the ACL for the consumer loan\nportfolio segment. Gross charge-offs by loan class\nare included in the following tables for the\nquarter ended March 31, 2023, which we monitor as\npart of our credit risk management practices;\nhowever, charge-offs are not a primary credit\nquality indicator for our loan portfolio. Many of\nour loss estimation techniques used for the ACL for\nloans rely on delinquency-based models; therefore,\ndelinquency is an important indicator of credit\nquality in the establishment of our ACL for\nconsumer loans. Credit quality information is\nprovided with the year of origination for term\nloans. Revolving loans may convert to term loans as\na result of a contractual provision in the original\nloan agreement or if modified for a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty. We obtain FICO\nscores at loan origination and the scores are\ngenerally updated at least quarterly, except in\nlimited circumstances, including compliance with\nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). FICO scores\nare not available for certain loan types or may not\nbe required if we deem it unnecessary due to strong\ncollateral and other borrower attributes. Table 5.9\nprovides the outstanding balances of our\nresidential mortgage loans by our primary credit\nquality indicators. LTV refers to the ratio\ncomparing the loan\u2019s outstanding balance to the\nproperty\u2019s collateral value. Combined LTV (CLTV)\nrefers to the combination of first lien mortgage\nand junior lien mortgage (including unused line\namounts for credit line products) ratios. We obtain\nLTVs and CLTVs using a cascade approach which first\nuses values provided by automated valuation models\n(AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not\navailable, then the value is estimated using the\noriginal appraised value adjusted by the change in\nHome Price Index (HPI) for the property location.\nIf an HPI is not available, the original appraised\nvalue is used. The HPI value is normally the only\nmethod considered for high value properties,\ngenerally with an original value of $ 1million or\nmore, as the AVM values have proven less accurate\nfor these properties. Generally, we obtain\navailable LTVs and CLTVs on a quarterly basis.\nCertain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV due to a\nlack of industry data availability and portfolios\nacquired from or serviced by other institutions.\n                               \n  78    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nTable 5.9: Credit Quality Indicators for\nResidential Mortgage Loans by Vintage\n                                                   \n                                                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n(1) Government insured or guaranteed loans\nrepresent loans whose repayments are predominantly\ninsured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA)\nor guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs\n(VA).

Our commercial\nloan modifications may include principal\nforgiveness, interest rate reductions, payment\ndelays, term extensions, or a combination of these\nmodifications. Commercial loan term extensions have\nterms that vary based on the borrower\u2019s request and\nare evaluated by our credit teams on an individual\nbasis. Our consumer loan modifications vary based\nupon the loan product and the modification program\noffered to the borrower, and may include interest\nrate reductions, payment delays, term extensions,\nprincipal forbearance or forgiveness, or a\ncombination of these modifications. Generally, our\nconsumer loan modification programs modify the loan\nterms to achieve payment terms that are more\naffordable to the borrower and, as a result,\nincrease the likelihood of full repayment of\nprincipal and interest. Our residential mortgage\nloan modification programs may offer a short-term\npayment deferral based upon the borrower's\ndemonstrated hardship, up to 12 months. If\nadditional assistance is needed after 12 months,\nthe borrower may request another loan modification.\nModifications may also include a trial payment\nperiod of three months to determine if the borrower\ncan perform in accordance with the proposed\npermanent loan modification terms. Loans in a trial\npayment period continue to advance through\ndelinquency status and accrue interest according to\ntheir original terms. Loans in a trial payment\nperiod are excluded from our loan modification\ndisclosures until the borrower has successfully\ncompleted the trial period and the loan\nmodification is formally executed. Residential\nmortgage loans in a trial payment period totaled $\n161million at March 31, 2023. Credit card loan\nmodifications result in a reduction in the credit\ncard interest rate and may be offered on a short-\nterm or long-term basis. A short-term interest rate\nreduction program reduces the borrower\u2019s interest\nrate for 12 months. A long-term interest rate\nreduction program provides a reduction of the\ninterest rate over a fixed five-year term. During\nthe modification period, the borrower\u2019s revolving\ncharge privileges are revoked. Auto loan\nmodifications generally include insignificant\n(e.g., three months or less) payment deferrals over\nthe loan term. The following disclosures provide\ninformation on loan modifications granted to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the\nform of principal forgiveness, interest rate\nreductions, other-than-insignificant (e.g., greater\nthan three months) payment delays, term extensions\nor a combination of these modifications, as well as\nthe financial effects of these modifications, and\nloan performance in the twelve months following the\nmodification. Loans that both modify and are paid\noff or charged-off during the period, resulting in\nan amortized cost balance of zero at the end of the\nperiod, are not included in the disclosures below.\nAdditionally, where amortized cost balances are\npresented below, accrued interest receivable is\nexcluded. See Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other\nAssets) for additional information on accrued\ninterest receivable. Borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty with modified terms mandated\nby a bankruptcy court are considered contractually\nmodified loans and are included in these\ndisclosures. These disclosures do not include loans\ndischarged by a bankruptcy court as the only\nconcession, which were insignificant for the\nquarter ended March 31, 2023.

We do not\nconsider loan\nresolutions such as\nforeclosure or short\nsale to be a TDR. In\naddition,\nCOVID-19-related\nmodifications are\ngenerally not classified\nas TDRs due to the\nrelief under the CARES\nAct and the Interagency\nStatement.

These\narrangements represent\ntrial modifications,\nwhich we classified and\naccounted for as TDRs\nthrough December 31,\n2022, prior to the\nadoption of ASU 2022-02.\nWhile loans are in trial\npayment programs, their\noriginal terms are not\nconsidered modified and\nthey continue to advance\nthrough delinquency\nstatus and accrue\ninterest according to\ntheir original terms.\nCommitments to lend\nadditional funds on\nloans whose terms have\nbeen modified in a TDR\namounted to $ 434million\nat December 31, 2022.\nTable 5.17 summarizes\nour TDR modifications by\nprimary modification\ntype and includes the\nfinancial effects of\nthese modifications.

The reported amounts include loans\nthat are new TDRs that may have COVID-19-related\npayment deferrals and exclude COVID-19-related\npayment deferrals on loans previously reported as\nTDRs given limited current financial effects other\nthan payment deferral.\n\n(3) Charge-offs include write-downs of the\ninvestment in the loan in the period it is\ncontractually modified.

In addition, there may be\ncases where we have a charge-off/down with no legal\nprincipal modification.\n\n(4) Recorded investment related to interest rate\nreduction reflects the effect of reduced interest\nrates on loans with an interest rate concession as\none of their concession types, which includes loans\nreported as a principal primary modification type\nthat also have an interest rate concession.\n\n(5) Trial modifications are granted a delay in\npayments due under the original terms during the\ntrial payment period. However, these loans continue\nto advance through delinquency status and accrue\ninterest according to their original terms.

See Note 12 (Fair Values of Assets and\nLiabilities) for additional information on key\nassumptions for residential MSRs.\nTable 6.2: Assumptions and Sensitivity of\nResidential MSRs\n                                                   \n  ($ in                                            \n  millio\u2026                                          \n  except                                           \n  cost to                                          \n  service               Mar 31,           Dec 31,  \n  amount\u2026                  2023              2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Fair                                             \n  value                                            \n  of         $  8,819              9,310           \n  intere\u2026                                          \n  held                                             \n  Expect\u2026                                          \n  weight\u2026                                          \n  life                      6.1               6.3  \n  (in                                              \n  years)                                           \n  Key                                              \n  assump\u2026                                          \n  Prepay\u2026                                          \n  rate            9.7         %      9.4           \n  assump\u2026                                          \n  (1)                                              \n  Impact                                           \n  on fair                                          \n  value                                            \n  from       $    287                288           \n  10%                                              \n  adverse                                          \n  change                                           \n  Impact                                           \n  on fair                                          \n  value                                            \n  from            684                688           \n  25%                                              \n  adverse                                          \n  change                                           \n  Discou\u2026                                          \n  rate            8.9         %      9.1           \n  assump\u2026                                          \n  Impact                                           \n  on fair                                          \n  value                                            \n  from       $    346                368           \n  100                                              \n  basis                                            \n  point                                            \n  increa\u2026                                          \n  Impact                                           \n  on fair                                          \n  value                                            \n  from            664                707           \n  200                                              \n  basis                                            \n  point                                            \n  increa\u2026                                          \n  Cost to                                          \n  service                                          \n  assump\u2026         101                102           \n  ($ per                                           \n  loan)                                            \n  Impact                                           \n  on fair                                          \n  value                                            \n  from            166                171           \n  10%                                              \n  adverse                                          \n  change                                           \n  Impact                                           \n  on fair                                          \n  value                                            \n  from            412                427           \n  25%                                              \n  adverse                                          \n  change                                           \n                                                   \n(1) Includes a blend of prepayment speeds and\nexpected defaults.

Changes in value based on\nvariations in assumptions generally cannot be\nextrapolated because the relationship of the change\nin the assumption to the change in value may not be\nlinear. Also, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the value of the other\ninterests held is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumptions.

The credit risk related to\nthese advances is limited since the reimbursement\nis generally senior to cash payments to investors.\nWe also advance payments of taxes and insurance for\nour owned loans which are collectible from the\nborrower. We maintain an allowance for\nuncollectible amounts for advances on loans\nserviced for others that may not be reimbursed if\nthe payments were not made in accordance with\napplicable servicing agreements or if the insurance\nor servicing agreements contain limitations on\nreimbursements. Servicing advances on owned loans\nare charged-off when deemed uncollectible.

In addition,\nWells Fargo and our subsidiaries may be requested\nto provide information to or otherwise cooperate\nwith government authorities in the conduct of\ninvestigations of other persons or industry groups.\nWe establish accruals for legal actions when\npotential losses associated with the actions become\nprobable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.\nFor such accruals, we record the amount we consider\nto be the best estimate within a range of potential\nlosses that are both probable and estimable;\nhowever, if we cannot determine a best estimate,\nthen we record the low end of the range of those\npotential losses.

AUTOMOBILE LENDING MATTERS On April 20,\n2018, the Company entered into consent orders with\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)\nand the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)\nto resolve, among other things, investigations by\nthe agencies into the Company\u2019s compliance risk\nmanagement program and its past practices involving\ncertain automobile collateral protection insurance\n(CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest rate\nlock extensions. Shareholders filed a putative\nsecurities fraud class action against the Company\nand its executive officers alleging material\nmisstatements and omissions of CPI-related\ninformation in the Company\u2019s public disclosures. In\nJanuary 2020, the court dismissed this action as to\nall defendants except the Company and a former\nexecutive officer and limited the action to two\nalleged misstatements. Subject to court approval,\nthe parties have entered into an agreement pursuant\nto which the Company will pay $ 300million to\nresolve this action. Additionally, a number of\nother lawsuits were filed by non-governmental\nparties seeking damages or other remedies related\nto these CPI policies and related to the unused\nportion of guaranteed automobile protection (GAP)\nwaiver or insurance agreements. As previously\ndisclosed, the Company entered into various\nsettlements to resolve these lawsuits, while others\nwere dismissed. In addition, federal and state\ngovernment agencies, including the CFPB, have\nundertaken formal or informal inquiries,\ninvestigations, or examinations regarding these and\nother issues related to the origination, servicing,\nand collection of consumer auto loans, including\nrelated insurance products. On December 20, 2022,\nthe Company entered into a consent order with the\nCFPB to resolve the CFPB\u2019s investigations related\nto automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts,\nand mortgage lending. The consent order requires,\namong other things, remediation to customers and\nthe payment of a $ 1.7billion civil penalty to the\nCFPB. As previously disclosed, the Company entered\ninto an agreement to resolve investigations by\nstate attorneys general. COMPANY 401(K) PLAN\nMATTERS Federal government agencies, including the\nUnited States Department of Labor (Department of\nLabor), have undertaken reviews of certain\ntransactions associated with the Employee Stock\nOwnership Plan feature of the Company\u2019s 401(k)\nplan, including the manner in which the 401(k) plan\npurchased certain securities used in connection\nwith the Company\u2019s contributions to the 401(k)\nplan. As previously disclosed, the Company entered\ninto an agreement to resolve the Department of\nLabor\u2019s review. On September 26, 2022, participants\nin the Company\u2019s 401(k) plan filed a putative class\naction in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Minnesota alleging that the Company\nviolated the Employee Retirement Income Security\nAct of 1974 in connection with certain of these\ntransactions. CONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION\nWells Fargo shareholders have brought a putative\nsecurities fraud class action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New\nYork alleging that the Company and certain of its\ncurrent and former executive officers and directors\nmade false or misleading statements regarding the\nCompany\u2019s efforts to comply with the February 2018\nconsent order with the Federal Reserve Board and\nthe April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB and\nOCC. Allegations related to the Company\u2019s efforts\nto comply with these three consent orders are also\namong the subjects of a shareholder derivative\nlawsuit filed in California state court. HIRING\nPRACTICES MATTERS Government agencies, including\nthe United States Department of Justice and the\nUnited States Securities and Exchange Commission,\nhave undertaken formal or informal inquiries or\ninvestigations regarding the Company\u2019s hiring\npractices related to diversity. A putative\nsecurities fraud class action has also been filed\nin the United States District Court for the\nNorthern District of California alleging that the\nCompany and certain of its executive officers made\nfalse or misleading statements about the Company\u2019s\nhiring practices related to diversity. Allegations\nrelated to the Company\u2019s hiring practices related\nto diversity are also among the subjects of\nshareholder derivative lawsuits filed in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia and in California state court.\nINTERCHANGE LITIGATION Plaintiffs representing a\nclass of merchants have filed putative class\nactions, and individual merchants have filed\nindividual actions, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,\nWells Fargo & Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and\nWachovia Corporation regarding the interchange fees\nassociated with Visa and MasterCard payment card\ntransactions. Visa, MasterCard, and several other\nbanks and bank holding companies are also named as\ndefendants in these actions. These actions have\nbeen consolidated in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of New York. The\namended and consolidated complaint asserts claims\nagainst defendants based on alleged violations of\nfederal and state antitrust laws and seeks damages\nas well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants\nallege that Visa, MasterCard, and payment card\nissuing banks unlawfully colluded to set\ninterchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that\nenforcement of certain Visa and MasterCard rules\nand alleged tying and bundling of services offered\nto merchants are anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and\nWachovia, along with other defendants and entities,\nare parties to Loss and Judgment Sharing\nAgreements, which provide that they, along with\nother entities, will share, based on a formula, in\nany losses from the\n                               \n  92    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                               \nInterchange Litigation.\nOn July 13, 2012, Visa,\nMasterCard, and the\nfinancial institution\ndefendants, including\nWells Fargo, signed a\nmemorandum of\nunderstanding with\nplaintiff merchants to\nresolve the consolidated\nclass action and reached\na separate settlement in\nprinciple of the\nconsolidated individual\nactions. The settlement\npayments to be made by\nall defendants in the\nconsolidated class and\nindividual actions\ntotaled approximately $\n6.6billion before\nreductions applicable to\ncertain merchants opting\nout of the settlement.\nThe class settlement\nalso provided for the\ndistribution to class\nmerchants of 10 basis\npoints of default\ninterchange across all\ncredit rate categories\nfor a period of eight\nconsecutive months. The\ndistrict court granted\nfinal approval of the\nsettlement, which was\nappealed to the United\nStates Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit\nby settlement objector\nmerchants. Other\nmerchants opted out of\nthe settlement and are\npursuing several\nindividual actions. On\nJune 30, 2016, the\nSecond Circuit vacated\nthe settlement agreement\nand reversed and\nremanded the\nconsolidated action to\nthe United States\nDistrict Court for the\nEastern District of New\nYork for further\nproceedings. On November\n23, 2016, prior class\ncounsel filed a petition\nto the United States\nSupreme Court, seeking\nreview of the reversal\nof the settlement by the\nSecond Circuit, and the\nSupreme Court denied the\npetition on March 27,\n2017. On November 30,\n2016, the district court\nappointed lead class\ncounsel for a damages\nclass and an equitable\nrelief class. The\nparties have entered\ninto a settlement\nagreement to resolve the\ndamages class claims\npursuant to which\ndefendants will pay a\ntotal of approximately $\n6.2billion, which\nincludes approximately $\n5.3billion of funds\nremaining from the 2012\nsettlement and $\n900million in additional\nfunding. The Company\u2019s\nallocated responsibility\nfor the additional\nfunding is approximately\n$ 94.5million. The court\ngranted final approval\nof the settlement on\nDecember 13, 2019, which\nwas appealed to the\nUnited States Court of\nAppeals for the Second\nCircuit by settlement\nobjector merchants. On\nMarch 15, 2023, the\nSecond Circuit affirmed\nthe damages class\nsettlement. Settlement\nobjector merchants filed\na petition for a\nrehearing by the Second\nCircuit en banc. On\nSeptember 27, 2021, the\ndistrict court granted\nthe plaintiffs\u2019 motion\nfor class certification\nin the equitable relief\ncase. Several of the\nopt-out and direct\naction litigations have\nbeen settled while\nothers remain pending.\nOFAC RELATED\nINVESTIGATION The\nCompany self-identified\nan issue whereby certain\nforeign banks utilized a\nWells Fargo software-\nbased solution to\nconduct import/export\ntrade-related financing\ntransactions with\ncountries and entities\nprohibited by the Office\nof Foreign Assets\nControl (OFAC) of the\nUnited States Department\nof the Treasury. We do\nnot believe any funds\nrelated to these\ntransactions flowed\nthrough accounts at\nWells Fargo as a result\nof the aforementioned\nconduct. The Company\nmade voluntary self-\ndisclosures to OFAC and\ncooperated with\ninvestigations or\ninquiries arising out of\nthis matter by federal\ngovernment agencies. In\nMarch 2023, the Company\nentered into agreements\npursuant to which it\nagreed to pay $\n67.8million to the\nFederal Reserve and $\n30million to OFAC in\norder to resolve their\ninvestigations. RECORD-\nKEEPING INVESTIGATIONS\nThe United States\nSecurities and Exchange\nCommission and the\nUnited States Commodity\nFutures Trading\nCommission have\nundertaken\ninvestigations regarding\nthe Company\u2019s compliance\nwith records retention\nrequirements relating to\nbusiness communications\nsent over unapproved\nelectronic messaging\nchannels.\n\nRMBS TRUSTEE LITIGATION\nIn December 2014,\nPhoenix Light SF Limited\n(Phoenix Light) and\ncertain related entities\nfiled a complaint in the\nUnited States District\nCourt for the Southern\nDistrict of New York\nalleging claims against\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A.,\nin its capacity as\ntrustee for a number of\nresidential mortgage-\nbacked securities (RMBS)\ntrusts. Complaints\nraising similar\nallegations have been\nfiled by Commerzbank AG\nin the Southern District\nof New York and by IKB\nInternational and IKB\nDeutsche Industriebank\nin New York state court.\nIn each case, the\nplaintiffs allege that\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A.,\nas trustee, caused\nlosses to investors, and\nplaintiffs assert causes\nof action based upon,\namong other things, the\ntrustee\u2019s alleged\nfailure to notify and\nenforce repurchase\nobligations of mortgage\nloan sellers for\npurported breaches of\nrepresentations and\nwarranties, notify\ninvestors of alleged\nevents of default, and\nabide by appropriate\nstandards of care\nfollowing alleged events\nof default. In July\n2022, the district court\ndismissed Phoenix\nLight\u2019s claims and\ncertain of the claims\nasserted by Commerzbank\nAG, and subsequently\nentered judgment in each\ncase in favor of Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A. In\nAugust 2022, Phoenix\nLight and Commerzbank AG\nappealed the district\ncourt\u2019s decision to the\nUnited States Court of\nAppeals for the Second\nCircuit. The Company\npreviously settled\ntwoclass actions filed\nby institutional\ninvestors and an action\nfiled by the National\nCredit Union\nAdministration with\nsimilar allegations. In\naddition, Park Royal I\nLLC and Park Royal II\nLLC have filed\nsubstantially similar\nlawsuits in New York\nstate court alleging\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A.,\nas trustee, failed to\ntake appropriate actions\nupon learning of\ndefective mortgage loan\ndocumentation. SEMINOLE\nTRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION\nThe Seminole Tribe of\nFlorida filed a\ncomplaint in Florida\nstate court alleging\nthat Wells Fargo, as\ntrustee, charged excess\nfees in connection with\nthe administration of a\nminor\u2019s trust and failed\nto invest the assets of\nthe trust prudently. The\ncomplaint was later\namended to include\nthreeindividual current\nand former beneficiaries\nas plaintiffs and to\nremove the Tribe as a\nparty to the case.\nOUTLOOK As described\nabove, the Company\nestablishes accruals for\nlegal actions when\npotential losses\nassociated with the\nactions become probable\nand the costs can be\nreasonably estimated.\nThe high end of the\nrange of reasonably\npossible losses in\nexcess of the Company\u2019s\naccrual for probable and\nestimable losses was\napproximately $\n1.4billion as of March\n31, 2023. The outcomes\nof legal actions are\nunpredictable and\nsubject to significant\nuncertainties, and it is\ninherently difficult to\ndetermine whether any\nloss is probable or even\npossible. It is also\ninherently difficult to\nestimate the amount of\nany loss and there may\nbe matters for which a\nloss is probable or\nreasonably possible but\nnot currently estimable.\nAccordingly, actual\nlosses may be in excess\nof the established\naccrual or the range of\nreasonably possible\nloss. Based on\ninformation currently\navailable, advice of\ncounsel, available\ninsurance coverage, and\nestablished reserves,\nWells Fargo believes\nthat the eventual\noutcome of the actions\nagainst Wells Fargo\nand/or its subsidiaries\nwill not, individually\nor in the aggregate,\nhave a material adverse\neffect on Wells Fargo\u2019s\nconsolidated financial\ncondition. However, it\nis possible that the\nultimate resolution of a\nmatter, if unfavorable,\nmay be material to Wells\nFargo\u2019s results of\noperations for any\nparticular period.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo & Company    93  \n                               \n                       \n  Note 11:Derivatives  \n                       \nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to market\nrisk, including interest rate risk, credit risk and\nforeign currency risk, and to assist customers with\ntheir risk management objectives. We designate\ncertain derivatives as hedging instruments in\nqualifying hedge accounting relationships (fair\nvalue or cash flow hedges). Our remaining\nderivatives consist of economic hedges that do not\nqualify for hedge accounting and derivatives held\nfor customer accommodation trading or other\npurposes. For additional information on our\nderivatives activities, see Note 14 (Derivatives)\nin our 2022 Form 10-K. Table 11.1 presents the\ntotal notional or contractual amounts and fair\nvalues for our derivatives. Derivative transactions\ncan be measured in terms of the notional amount,\nbut this amount is not recorded on our consolidated\nbalance sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation,\na meaningful measure of the risk profile of the\ninstruments. The notional amount is generally not\nexchanged, but is used only as the basis on which\nderivative cash flows are determined.\nTable 11.1: Notional or Contractual Amounts and\nFair Values of Derivatives\n                                                   \n                                                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      9      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2014      \u2026      \u2026      \u2014    \n                         \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n(1) In first quarter 2023, we adopted ASU 2018-12 \u2013\nFinancial Services \u2013 Insurance (Topic 944):\nTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-\nDuration Contracts . For additional information,\nsee Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies).\nBalance Sheet Offsetting We execute substantially\nall of our derivative transactions under master\nnetting arrangements. Where legally enforceable,\nthese master netting arrangements give the ability,\nin the event of default by the counterparty, to\nliquidate securities held as collateral and to\noffset receivables and payables with the same\ncounterparty. We reflect all derivative balances\nand related cash collateral subject to enforceable\nmaster netting arrangements on a net basis on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. We do not net non-cash\ncollateral that we receive or pledge against\nderivative balances on our consolidated balance\nsheet. For disclosure purposes, we present \u201cTotal\nDerivatives, net\u201d which represents the aggregate of\nour net exposure to each counterparty after\nconsidering the balance sheet netting adjustments\nand any non-cash collateral. We manage derivative\nexposure by monitoring the credit risk associated\nwith each counterparty using counterparty-specific\ncredit risk limits, using master netting\narrangements and obtaining collateral. Table 11.2\nprovides information on the fair values of\nderivative assets and liabilities subject to\nenforceable master netting arrangements, the\nbalance sheet netting adjustments and the resulting\nnet fair value amount recorded on our consolidated\nbalance sheet, as well as the non-cash collateral\nassociated with such arrangements. In addition to\nthe netting amounts included in the table, we also\nhave balance sheet netting related to resale and\nrepurchase agreements that are disclosed within\nNote 15 (Pledged Assets and

Counterparty valuation\nadjustments related to derivative assets were $\n346million and $ 372million and debit valuation\nadjustments related to derivative liabilities were\n$ 333million and $ 331million as of March 31, 2023,\nand December 31, 2022, respectively, and were\nprimarily related to interest rate contracts.\n\n(2) In first quarter 2023, we adopted ASU 2018-12 \u2013\nFinancial Services \u2013 Insurance (Topic 944):\nTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-\nDuration Contracts . For additional information,\nsee Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies).\n\nFair Value and Cash Flow Hedges For fair value\nhedges, we use interest rate swaps to convert\ncertain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and time\ncertificates of deposit to floating rates to hedge\nour exposure to interest rate risk. We also enter\ninto cross-currency swaps, cross-currency interest\nrate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our\nexposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate\nrisk associated with the issuance of non-U.S.\ndollar denominated long-term debt. We also enter\ninto futures contracts, forward contracts, and swap\ncontracts to hedge our exposure to the price risk\nof physical commodities included in Other Assets.\nIn addition, we use interest rate swaps, cross-\ncurrency swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps\nand forward contracts to hedge against changes in\nfair value of certain investments in available-for-\nsale (AFS) debt securities due to changes in\ninterest rates, foreign currency rates, or both.\nFor certain fair value hedges of interest rate\nrisk, we use the portfolio layer method to hedge\nstated amounts of closed portfolios of AFS debt\nsecurities. For certain fair value hedges of\nforeign currency risk, changes in fair value of\ncross-currency swaps attributable to changes in\ncross-currency basis spreads are excluded from the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded in\nother comprehensive income (OCI). See Note 20\n(Other Comprehensive Income) for the amounts\nrecognized in other comprehensive income. For cash\nflow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to hedge\nthe variability in interest payments received on\ncertain interest-earning deposits with banks and\ncertain floating-rate commercial loans, and\ninterest paid on certain floating-rate debt due to\nchanges in the contractually specified interest\nrate. We also use cross-currency swaps to hedge\nvariability in interest payments on fixed-rate\nforeign currency-denominated long-term debt due to\nchanges in foreign exchange rates. We estimate $\n693million pre-tax of deferred net losses related\nto cash flow hedges in OCI at March 31, 2023, will\nbe reclassified into net interest income during the\nnext twelve months. For cash flow hedges as of\nMarch 31, 2023, we are hedging our interest rate\nand foreign currency exposure to the variability of\nfuture cash flows for all forecasted transactions\nfor a maximum of 9years. For additional information\non our accounting hedges, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) in our 2022 Form\n10-K. Table 11.3 and Table 11.4 show the net gains\n(losses) related to derivatives in cash flow and\nfair value hedging relationships, respectively.\n                               \n  Wells Fargo &

In the\ndetermination of the\nclassification of\nfinancial instruments in\nLevel 2 or Level 3 of\nthe fair value\nhierarchy, we consider\nall available\ninformation, including\nobservable market data,\nindications of market\nliquidity and\norderliness, and our\nunderstanding of the\nvaluation techniques and\nsignificant inputs used.\nThis determination is\nultimately based upon\nthe specific facts and\ncircumstances of each\ninstrument or instrument\ncategory and judgments\nare made regarding the\nsignificance of the\nunobservable inputs to\nthe instruments\u2019 fair\nvalue measurement in its\nentirety. If\nunobservable inputs are\nconsidered significant,\nthe instrument is\nclassified as Level 3.\nWe do not classify\nnonmarketable equity\nsecurities in the fair\nvalue hierarchy if we\nuse the non-published\nnet asset value (NAV)\nper share (or its\nequivalent) as a\npractical expedient to\nmeasure fair value.\nMarketable equity\nsecurities with\npublished NAVs are\nclassified in the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    101  \n                                \nNote 12: Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities\n(continued)\n\nAssets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a\nRecurring Basis Table 12.1 presents the balances of\nassets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a\nrecurring basis.\n\nTable 12.1: Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\n                                                   \n                                                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n(1) Represents balance sheet netting of derivative\nasset and liability balances, related cash\ncollateral and portfolio level counterparty\nvaluation adjustments.

SPEs are often formed in\nconnection with securitization transactions whereby\nfinancial assets are transferred to an SPE. SPEs\nformed in connection with securitization\ntransactions are generally considered variable\ninterest entities (VIEs). The VIE may alter the\nrisk profile of the asset by entering into\nderivative transactions or obtaining credit\nsupport, and issues various forms of interests in\nthose assets to investors. When we transfer\nfinancial assets from our consolidated balance\nsheet to a VIE in connection with a securitization,\nwe typically receive cash and sometimes other\ninterests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets we\ntransfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may\nretain the right to service the transferred assets\nand repurchase the transferred assets if the\noutstanding balance of the assets falls below the\nlevel at which the cost to service the assets\nexceed the benefits. In addition, we may purchase\nthe right to service loans transferred to a VIE by\na third party. In connection with our\nsecuritization or other VIE activities, we have\nvarious forms of ongoing involvement with VIEs,\nwhich may include: \u2022 underwriting securities issued\nby VIEs and subsequently making markets in those\nsecurities; \u2022 providing credit enhancement on\nsecurities issued by VIEs through the use of\nletters of credit or financial guarantees; \u2022\nentering into other derivative contracts with VIEs;\n\u2022 holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs;\n\u2022 acting as servicer or investment manager for\nVIEs; \u2022 providing administrative or trustee\nservices to VIEs; and \u2022 providing seller financing\nto VIEs. Loan Sales and Securitization Activity We\nperiodically transfer consumer and commercial loans\nand other types of financial assets in\nsecuritization and whole loan sale transactions.\nMORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED\nENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE In the\nnormal course of business we sell originated and\npurchased residential and commercial mortgage loans\nto government-sponsored entities (GSEs). These\nloans are generally transferred into\nsecuritizations sponsored by the GSEs, which\nprovide certain credit guarantees to investors and\nservicers. We also transfer mortgage loans into\nsecuritization pools pursuant to Government\nNational Mortgage Association (GNMA) guidelines\nwhich are insured by the Federal Housing\nAdministration (FHA) or guaranteed by the\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA). Mortgage loans\neligible for securitization with the GSEs or GNMA\nare considered conforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA\ndesign the structure of these securitizations,\nsponsor the involved VIEs, and have power over the\nactivities most significant to the VIE. We account\nfor loans transferred in conforming mortgage loan\nsecuritization transactions as sales and do not\nconsolidate the VIEs as we are not the primary\nbeneficiary. In exchange for the transfer of loans,\nwe typically receive securities issued by the VIEs\nwhich we sell to third parties for cash or hold for\ninvestment purposes as HTM or AFS securities. We\nalso retain servicing rights on the transferred\nloans. As a servicer, we retain the option to\nrepurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization\npools, which becomes exercisable when three\nscheduled loan payments remain unpaid by the\nborrower. During the quarters ended March 31, 2023\nand 2022, we repurchased loans of $ 92million and $\n933million, respectively, which primarily\nrepresented repurchases of government insured\nloans. We recorded assets and related liabilities\nof $ 935million and $ 743million at March 31, 2023,\nand December 31, 2022, respectively, where we did\nnot exercise our option to repurchase eligible\nloans. Upon transfers of loans, we also provide\nindemnification for losses incurred due to material\nbreaches of contractual representations and\nwarranties as well as other recourse arrangements.\nAt March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, our\nliability for these repurchase and recourse\narrangements was $ 165million and $ 167million,\nrespectively, and the maximum exposure to loss was\n$ 13.9billion and $ 13.8billion at March 31, 2023,\nand December 31, 2022, respectively. Substantially\nall residential servicing activity is related to\nassets transferred to GSE and GNMA securitizations.\nSee Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for\nadditional information about residential and\ncommercial servicing rights, advances and servicing\nfees. NONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS\nIn the normal course of business, we sell\nnonconforming residential and commercial mortgage\nloans in securitization transactions that we design\nand sponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan\nsecuritizations do not involve a government credit\nguarantee, and accordingly, beneficial interest\nholders are subject to credit risk of the\nunderlying assets held by the securitization VIE.\nWe typically originate the transferred loans and\naccount for the transfers as sales. We also\ntypically retain the right to service the loans and\nmay hold other beneficial interests issued by the\nVIEs, such as debt securities held for investment\npurposes. Our servicing role related to\nnonconforming commercial mortgage loan\nsecuritizations is limited to primary or master\nservicer. We do not consolidate the VIE because the\nmost significant decisions impacting the\nperformance of the VIE are generally made by the\nspecial servicer or the controlling class security\nholder. For our residential nonconforming mortgage\nloan securitizations accounted for as sales, we\neither do not hold variable interests that we\nconsider potentially significant or are not the\nprimary servicer for a majority of the VIE assets.\nWHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We may also sell whole\nloans to VIEs where we have continuing involvement\nin the form of financing. We account for these\ntransfers as sales, and do not consolidate the VIEs\nas we do not have the power to direct the most\nsignificant activities of the VIEs. Table 13.1\npresents information about transfers of assets\nduring the periods presented for which we recorded\nthe transfers as sales and have continuing\ninvolvement with the transferred assets. In\nconnection with these transfers, we received\nproceeds and recorded servicing assets and\nsecurities. Each of these interests are initially\nmeasured at fair value. Servicing rights are\nclassified as Level 3 measurements, and generally\nsecurities are classified as Level 2. The majority\nof our transfers relate to residential mortgage\nsecuritizations with the GSEs or GNMA and generally\nresult in nogain or loss because the loans are\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nAdditionally, we may transfer certain government\ninsured loans that we previously\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    109  \n                                \nNote 13: Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities (continued)\n\nrepurchased.

In\nresecuritization transactions, we transfer trading\ndebt securities to VIEs in exchange for new\nbeneficial interests that are sold to third parties\nat or shortly after securitization settlement. This\nactivity is performed for customers seeking a\nspecific return or risk profile. Substantially all\nof our transactions involve the resecuritization of\nconforming mortgage-backed securities issued by the\nGSEs or guaranteed by GNMA. We do not consolidate\nthe resecuritization VIEs as we share in the\ndecision-making power with third parties and do not\nhold significant economic interests in the VIEs\nother than for market-making activities. During the\nquarters ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we\ntransferred securities of $ 3.2billion and $\n6.4billion, respectively, to resecuritization VIEs,\nand retained securities of $ 198million and $\n738million, respectively. These amounts are not\nincluded in Table 13.1. Related total VIE assets\nwere $ 111.6billion and $ 112.0billion at March 31,\n2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. As of\nMarch 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we held $\n1.3billion and $ 793million of securities,\nrespectively.\n                                \n  110    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nSold or Securitized Loans Serviced for Others Table\n13.3 presents information about loans that we sold\nor securitized in which we have ongoing involvement\nas servicer. Delinquent loans include loans 90 days\nor more past due and loans in bankruptcy,\nregardless of delinquency status. For loans sold or\nsecuritized where servicing is our only form of\ncontinuing involvement, we generally experience a\nloss only if we were required to repurchase a\ndelinquent loan or foreclosed asset due to a breach\nin representations and warranties associated with\nour loan sale or servicing contracts. Table 13.3\nexcludes mortgage loans in GSE or GNMA\nsecuritizations of $ 693.2billion and $\n704.5billion at March 31, 2023, and December 31,\n2022, respectively. Delinquent loans and foreclosed\nassets related to loans in GSE and GNMA\nsecuritizations were $ 3.6billion and $ 4.6billion\nat March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively.\n\nTable 13.3: Sold or Securitized Loans Serviced for\nOthers\n                                                   \n                    \u2026                              \n                    \u2026                              \n            \u2026       \u2026                              \n            \u2026       \u2026                              \n            \u2026       \u2026                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      4    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026      5      3    \n      $  \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      7    \n                                                   \n(1) Includes $ 290million and $ 274million of\ncommercial foreclosed assets and $ 29million and $\n25million of residential foreclosed assets at March\n31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n\nTransactions with Unconsolidated VIEs MORTGAGE LOAN\nSECURITIZATIONS Table 13.4 includes nonconforming\nmortgage loan securitizations where we originate\nand transfer the loans to the unconsolidated\nsecuritization VIEs that we sponsor. For additional\ninformation about these VIEs, see the \u201cLoan Sales\nand Securitization Activity\u201d section within this\nNote. Nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations\nalso include commercial mortgage loan\nsecuritizations sponsored by third parties where we\ndid not originate or transfer the loans but serve\nas master servicer and invest in securities that\ncould be potentially significant to the VIE.\nConforming loan securitization and resecuritization\ntransactions involving the GSEs and GNMA are\nexcluded from Table 13.4 because we are not the\nsponsor or we do not have power over the activities\nmost significant to the VIEs. Additionally, due to\nthe nature of the guarantees provided by the GSEs\nand the FHA and VA, our credit risk associated with\nthese VIEs is limited. For additional information\nabout conforming mortgage loan securitizations and\nresecuritizations, see the \u201cLoan Sales and\nSecuritization Activity\u201d and \u201cResecuritization\nActivities\u201d sections within this Note. COMMERCIAL\nREAL ESTATE LOANS We may transfer purchased\nindustrial development bonds and GSE credit\nenhancements to VIEs in exchange for beneficial\ninterests. We may also acquire such beneficial\ninterests in transactions where we do not act as a\ntransferor. We own all of the beneficial interests\nand may also service the underlying mortgages that\nserve as collateral to the bonds. The GSEs have the\npower to direct the servicing and workout\nactivities of the VIE in the event of a default,\ntherefore we do not have control over the key\ndecisions of the VIEs. OTHER VIE STRUCTURES We\nengage in various forms of structured finance\narrangements with other VIEs, including asset-\nbacked finance structures and other securitizations\ncollateralized by asset classes other than\nmortgages. Collateral may include rental\nproperties, asset-backed securities, student loans\nand mortgage loans. We may participate in\nstructuring or marketing the arrangements as well\nas provide financing, service one or more of the\nunderlying assets, or enter into derivatives with\nthe VIEs. We may also receive fees for those\nservices. We are not the primary beneficiary of\nthese structures because we do not have power to\ndirect the most significant activities of the VIEs.\nTable 13.4 provides a summary of our exposure to\nthe unconsolidated VIEs described above, which\nincludes investments in securities, loans,\nguarantees, liquidity agreements, commitments and\ncertain derivatives. We exclude certain\ntransactions with unconsolidated VIEs when our\ncontinuing involvement is temporary or\nadministrative in nature or insignificant in size.\nIn Table 13.4, \u201cTotal VIE assets\u201d represents the\nremaining principal balance of assets held by\nunconsolidated VIEs using the most current\ninformation available. \u201cCarrying value\u201d is the\namount in our consolidated balance sheet related to\nour involvement with the unconsolidated VIEs.\n\u201cMaximum exposure to loss\u201d is determined as the\ncarrying value of our investment in the VIEs\nexcluding the unconditional repurchase options that\nhave not been exercised, plus the remaining undrawn\nliquidity and lending commitments, the notional\namount of net written derivative contracts, and\ngenerally the notional amount of, or stressed loss\nestimate for, other commitments and guarantees.\nDebt, guarantees and other commitments include\namounts related to lending arrangements, liquidity\nagreements, and certain loss sharing obligations\nassociated with loans originated, sold, and\nserviced under certain GSE programs. \u201cMaximum\nexposure to loss\u201d represents estimated loss that\nwould be incurred under severe, hypothetical\ncircumstances, for which we believe the possibility\nis extremely remote, such as where the value of our\ninterests and any associated collateral declines to\nzero, without any consideration of recovery or\noffset from any economic hedges. Accordingly, this\ndisclosure is not an indication of expected loss.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    111  \n                                \nNote 13: Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities (continued)\n\nTable 13.4: Unconsolidated VIEs\n                                                   \n                                                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                       \u2014      \u2026    \n                                       \u2014      \u2026    \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                       \u2014      \u2026    \n                                       \u2014      \u2026    \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                       \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   \n(1) Includes $ 205million and $ 172million of\nsecurities classified as trading at March 31, 2023,\nand December 31, 2022, respectively.\n\n(2) All other assets includes mortgage servicing\nrights, derivative assets, and other assets\n(predominantly servicing advances).\n\nINVOLVEMENT WITH TAX CREDIT VIES In addition to the\nunconsolidated VIEs in Table 13.4, we may invest in\nor provide funding to affordable housing, renewable\nenergy or similar projects that are designed to\ngenerate a return primarily through the realization\nof federal tax credits and other tax benefits.

We also had loans to tax credit VIEs\nwith a carrying value of $ 1.9billion and $\n2.0billion at March 31, 2023, and December 31,\n2022, respectively. Our maximum exposure to loss\nfor tax credit VIEs at March 31, 2023, and December\n31, 2022, was $ 28.7billion and $ 28.0billion,\nrespectively. Our maximum exposure to loss included\ntotal unfunded equity and lending commitments of $\n8.2billion and $ 7.3billion at March 31, 2023, and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively. See Note 14\n(Guarantees and Other Commitments) for additional\ninformation about commitments to purchase equity\nsecurities. Our affordable housing equity\ninvestments qualify for the low-income housing tax\ncredit (LIHTC). For additional information on our\nLIHTC investments, see Note 16 (Securitizations and\nVariable Interest Entities) in our 2022 Form 10-K.\nConsolidated VIEs We consolidate VIEs where we are\nthe primary beneficiary. We are the primary\nbeneficiary of the following structure types:\nCOMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASES We may\nsecuritize dealer floor plan loans in a revolving\nmaster trust entity. As servicer and residual\ninterest holder, we control the key decisions of\nthe trust and consolidate the entity. The total VIE\nassets held by the master trust represent a\nmajority of the total VIE assets presented for this\ncategory in Table 13.5. In a separate transaction\nstructure, we may provide the majority of debt and\nequity financing to an SPE that engages in lending\nand leasing to specific vendors and service the\nunderlying collateral. OTHER VIE STRUCTURES Other\nVIEs are predominantly related to municipal tender\noption bond (MTOB) transactions. MTOBs are vehicles\nto finance the purchase of municipal bonds through\nthe issuance of short-term debt to investors. Our\ninvolvement with MTOBs includes serving as the\nresidual interest holder, which provides control\nover the key decisions of the VIE, as well as the\nremarketing agent or liquidity provider related to\nthe debt issued to investors. We may also\nsecuritize nonconforming mortgage loans, in which\nour involvement includes servicer of the underlying\nassets and holder of subordinate or senior\nsecurities issued by the VIE. During second quarter\n2022, we purchased the outstanding mortgage loans\nfrom the VIEs and extinguished the related debt\nassociated with such securitizations.\n                                \n  112    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nTable 13.5 presents a summary of financial assets\nand liabilities of our consolidated VIEs. The\ncarrying value represents assets and liabilities\nrecorded on our consolidated balance sheet. \u201cTotal\nVIE assets\u201d includes affiliate balances that are\neliminated upon consolidation, and therefore in\nsome instances will differ from the carrying value\nof assets. On our consolidated balance sheet, we\nseparately disclose (1) the consolidated assets of\ncertain VIEs that can only be used to settle the\nliabilities of those VIEs, and (2) the consolidated\nliabilities of certain VIEs for which the VIE\ncreditors do not have recourse to Wells Fargo.\nTable 13.5: Transactions with Consolidated VIEs\n                                                   \n                 C\u2026                                \n                 v\u2026                    \u2026           \n            \u2026     \u2013                    \u2026           \n            \u2026    a\u2026           \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n            \u2026    (\u2026  \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026       5\u2026        \u2014       1\u2026       -\u2026     \n         \u2026        \u2014       71        1       -\u2026     \n      $  \u2026       5\u2026       71       1\u2026       -\u2026     \n                                                   \n      $  \u2026       4\u2026        \u2014       1\u2026       -\u2026     \n         \u2026        \u2014       71        1       -\u2026     \n      $  \u2026       4\u2026       71       1\u2026       -\u2026     \n                                                   \n(1) All other assets includes cash and due from\nbanks, and other assets.\n(2) Liabilities include short-term borrowings, and\naccrued expenses and other liabilities.\n                                                   \n  Other Transactions                               \n                                                   \nIn addition to the\ntransactions included in\nthe previous tables, we\nhave used wholly-owned\ntrust preferred security\nVIEs to issue debt\nsecurities or preferred\nequity exclusively to\nthird-party investors.\nAs the sole assets of\nthe VIEs are receivables\nfrom us, we do not\nconsolidate the VIEs\neven though we own all\nof the voting equity\nshares of the VIEs, have\nfully guaranteed the\nobligations of the VIEs,\nand may have the right\nto redeem the third-\nparty securities under\ncertain circumstances.\nOn our consolidated\nbalance sheet, we\nreported the debt\nsecurities issued to the\nVIEs as long-term junior\nsubordinated debt with a\ncarrying value of $\n404million and $\n401million at March 31,\n2023, and December 31,\n2022, respectively.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    113  \n                                \n                                            \n  Note 14:Guarantees and Other Commitments  \n                                            \nGuarantees are contracts that contingently require\nus to make payments to a guaranteed party based on\nan event or a change in an underlying asset,\nliability, rate or index.

Estimated maximum\nexposure to loss was $ 210million and $ 157million\nwith related collateral of $ 1.5billion and $\n1.3billion as of March 31, 2023, and December 31,\n2022, respectively.\nMaximum exposure to loss represents the estimated\nloss that would be incurred under an assumed\nhypothetical circumstance, despite what we believe\nis a remote possibility, where the value of our\ninterests and any associated collateral declines to\nzero. Maximum exposure to loss estimates in Table\n14.1 do not reflect economic hedges or collateral\nwe could use to offset or recover losses we may\nincur under our guarantee agreements. Accordingly,\nthese amounts are not an indication of expected\nloss. We believe the carrying value is more\nrepresentative of our current exposure to loss than\nmaximum exposure to loss. The carrying value\nrepresents the fair value of the guarantee, if any,\nand also includes an ACL for guarantees, if\napplicable. In determining the ACL for guarantees,\nwe consider the credit risk of the related\ncontingent obligation. For our guarantees in Table\n14.1, non-investment grade represents those\nguarantees on which we have a higher risk of\nperformance under the terms of the guarantee, which\nis determined based on an external rating or an\ninternal credit grade that is below investment\ngrade. WRITTEN OPTIONS We enter into written\nforeign currency options and over-the-counter\nwritten equity put options that are derivative\ncontracts that have the characteristics of a\nguarantee. The fair value of written options\nrepresents our view of the probability that we will\nbe required to perform under the contract. The fair\nvalue of these written options was a liability of $\n150million and $ 15million at March 31, 2023, and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively. The fair value may\nbe an asset as a result of deferred premiums on\ncertain option trades. The maximum exposure to loss\nrepresents the notional value of these derivative\ncontracts. At March 31, 2023, the maximum exposure\nto loss was $ 32.1billion, with $ 29.8billion\nexpiring in three years or less compared with $\n23.4billion and $ 21.3billion, respectively, at\nDecember 31, 2022. See Note 11 (Derivatives) for\nadditional information regarding written derivative\ncontracts. MERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES We provide\ndebit and credit card transaction processing\nservices through payment networks directly for\nmerchants and as a sponsor for merchant processing\nservicers, including our joint venture with a third\nparty that is accounted for as an equity method\ninvestment. In our role as the merchant acquiring\nbank, we have a potential obligation in connection\nwith payment and delivery disputes between the\nmerchant and the cardholder that are resolved in\nfavor of the cardholder, referred to as a charge-\nback transaction. We estimate our potential maximum\nexposure to be the total merchant transaction\nvolume processed in the preceding four months,\nwhich is generally the lifecycle for a charge-back\ntransaction. As of March 31, 2023, our potential\nmaximum exposure was approximately $ 757.6billion,\nand related losses, including those from our joint\nventure entity, were insignificant. GUARANTEES OF\nSUBSIDIARIES The Parent fully and unconditionally\nguarantees the payment of principal, interest, and\nany other amounts that may be due on securities\nthat its 100% owned finance subsidiary, Wells Fargo\nFinance LLC, may issue.These securities are not\nguaranteed by any other subsidiary of the Parent.\nThe guaranteed liabilities were $ 891million and $\n948million at March 31, 2023, and December 31,\n2022, respectively. These guarantees rank on parity\nwith all of the Parent\u2019s other unsecured and\nunsubordinated indebtedness. OTHER COMMITMENTS To\nmeet the financing needs of our customers, we may\nenter into commitments to purchase debt and equity\nsecurities to provide capital for their funding,\nliquidity or other future needs. As of March 31,\n2023, and December 31,\n                                \n  114    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \n2022, we had commitments\nto purchase debt\nsecurities of $\n249million and $\n100million and\ncommitments to purchase\nequity securities of $\n4.7billion and $\n3.8billion,\nrespectively. As part of\nmaintaining our\nmemberships in certain\nclearing organizations,\nwe are required to stand\nready to provide\nliquidity to sustain\nmarket clearing activity\nin the event unforeseen\nevents occur or are\ndeemed likely to occur.\nCertain of these\nobligations are\nguarantees of other\nmembers\u2019 performance and\naccordingly are included\nin Table 14.1 in Other\nguarantees and\nindemnifications. We\nhave commitments to\nenter into resale and\nsecurities borrowing\nagreements as well as\nrepurchase and\nsecurities lending\nagreements with certain\ncounterparties,\nincluding central\nclearing organizations.\nThe amount of our\nunfunded contractual\ncommitments for resale\nand securities borrowing\nagreements was $\n17.6billion and $\n19.9billion as of March\n31, 2023, and December\n31, 2022, respectively.\nThe amount of our\nunfunded contractual\ncommitments for\nrepurchase and\nsecurities lending\nagreements was $\n2.5billion and $\n1.6billion as of March\n31, 2023, and December\n31, 2022, respectively.\nGiven the nature of\nthese commitments, they\nare excluded from Table\n5.4 (Unfunded Credit\nCommitments) in Note 5\n(Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses).\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    115  \n                                \n                                         \n  Note 15:Pledged Assets and Collateral  \n                                         \nPledged Assets Table 15.1 provides the carrying\namount of on-balance sheet pledged assets as well\nas the fair value of other pledged collateral not\nrecognized on our consolidated balance sheet, which\nwe have received from third parties, have the right\nto repledge and have repledged. These amounts\ninclude assets pledged in transactions accounted\nfor as secured borrowings, which are presented\nparenthetically on our consolidated balance sheet.\nTRADING RELATED ACTIVITY Our trading businesses may\npledge debt and equity securities in connection\nwith securities sold under agreements to repurchase\n(repurchase agreements) and securities lending\narrangements. The collateral that we pledge related\nto our trading activities may include our own\ncollateral as well as collateral that we have\nreceived from third parties and have the right to\nrepledge. All of the collateral we pledge related\nto trading activity is eligible to be repledged or\nsold by the secured party. NON-TRADING RELATED\nACTIVITY As part of our liquidity management\nstrategy, we may pledge loans, debt securities, and\nother financial assets to secure trust and public\ndeposits, borrowings and letters of credit from\nFederal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and\nfor other purposes as required or permitted by law\nor insurance statutory requirements. Substantially\nall of the non-trading activity pledged collateral\nis not eligible to be repledged or sold by the\nsecured party. VIE RELATED We pledge assets in\nconnection with various types of transactions\nentered into with VIEs. These pledged assets can\nonly be used to settle the liabilities of those\nentities. We also have loans recorded on our\nconsolidated balance sheet which represent certain\ndelinquent loans that are eligible for repurchase\nfrom GNMA loan securitizations. See Note 13\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities)\nfor additional information on consolidated VIE\nassets.\nTable 15.1: Pledged Assets\n                                                   \n                        Mar                Dec     \n  (in                   31,                31,     \n  milli\u2026                2023               2022    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Relat\u2026                                           \n  to                                               \n  tradi\u2026                                           \n  activ\u2026                                           \n  Off-b\u2026                                           \n  sheet                                            \n  reple\u2026                                           \n  third\u2026                                           \n  owned     $   53,127             38,191          \n  debt                                             \n  and                                              \n  equity                                           \n  secur\u2026                                           \n  Tradi\u2026                                           \n  debt                                             \n  secur\u2026        50,259             28,284          \n  and                                              \n  other                                            \n  Equity         1,625              1,477          \n  secur\u2026                                           \n  Total                                            \n  pledg\u2026                                           \n  assets                                           \n  relat\u2026       105,011             67,952          \n  to                                               \n  tradi\u2026                                           \n  activ\u2026                                           \n  Relat\u2026                                           \n  to                                               \n  non-t\u2026                                           \n  activ\u2026                                           \n  Loans        355,979            344,000          \n  Debt                                             \n  secur\u2026                                           \n  Avail\u2026        48,135             50,538          \n  Held-\u2026        15,626             17,477          \n  Equity           169                141          \n  secur\u2026                                           \n  Total                                            \n  pledg\u2026                                           \n  assets                                           \n  relat\u2026       419,909            412,156          \n  to                                               \n  non-t\u2026                                           \n  activ\u2026                                           \n  Relat\u2026                                           \n  to                                               \n  VIEs:                                            \n  Conso\u2026                                           \n  VIE            5,576              5,064          \n  assets                                           \n  Loans                                            \n  eligi\u2026                                           \n  for                                              \n  repur\u2026           942                749          \n  from                                             \n  GNMA                                             \n  secur\u2026                                           \n  Total                                            \n  pledg\u2026                                           \n  assets         6,518              5,813          \n  relat\u2026                                           \n  to                                               \n  VIEs                                             \n  Total                                            \n  pledg\u2026    $  531,438            485,921          \n  assets                                           \n                                                   \nSecurities and Other Collateralized Financing\nActivities We enter into resale and repurchase\nagreements and securities borrowing and lending\nagreements (collectively, \u201csecurities financing\nactivities\u201d) typically to finance trading positions\n(including securities and derivatives), acquire\nsecurities to cover short trading positions,\naccommodate customers\u2019 financing needs, and settle\nother securities obligations. These activities are\nconducted through our broker-dealer subsidiaries\nand, to a lesser extent, through other bank\nentities. Our securities financing activities\nprimarily involve high-quality, liquid securities\nsuch as U.S. Treasury securities and government\nagency securities and, to a lesser extent, less\nliquid securities, including equity securities,\ncorporate bonds and asset-backed securities. We\naccount for these transactions as collateralized\nfinancings in which we typically receive or pledge\nsecurities as collateral. We believe these\nfinancing transactions generally do not have\nmaterial credit risk given the collateral provided\nand the related monitoring processes. We also enter\ninto resale agreements involving collateral other\nthan securities, such as loans, as part of our\ncommercial lending business activities. OFFSETTING\nOF SECURITIES AND OTHER COLLATERALIZED FINANCING\nACTIVITIES Table 15.2 presents resale and\nrepurchase agreements subject to master repurchase\nagreements (MRA) and securities borrowing and\nlending agreements subject to master securities\nlending agreements (MSLA). Where legally\nenforceable, these master netting arrangements give\nthe ability, in the event of default by the\ncounterparty, to liquidate securities held as\ncollateral and to offset receivables and payables\nwith the same counterparty. Collateralized\nfinancings, and those with a single counterparty,\nare presented net on our consolidated balance\nsheet, provided certain criteria are met that\npermit balance sheet netting. The majority of\ntransactions subject to these agreements do not\nmeet those criteria and thus are not eligible for\nbalance sheet netting. Collateral we pledged\nconsists of non-cash instruments, such as\nsecurities or loans, and is not netted on our\nconsolidated balance sheet against the related\nliability. Collateral we received\n                                \n  116    Wells Fargo & Company  \n                                \nincludes securities or loans and is not recognized\non our consolidated balance sheet. Collateral\npledged or received may be increased or decreased\nover time to maintain certain contractual\nthresholds, as the assets underlying each\narrangement fluctuate in value. Generally, these\nagreements require collateral to exceed the asset\nor liability recognized on the balance sheet. The\nfollowing table includes the amount of collateral\npledged or received related to exposures subject to\nenforceable MRAs or MSLAs. While these agreements\nare typically over-collateralized, U.S. GAAP\nrequires disclosure in this table to limit the\nreported amount of such collateral to the amount of\nthe related recognized asset or liability for each\ncounterparty. In addition to the amounts included\nin Table 15.2, we also have balance sheet netting\nrelated to derivatives that is disclosed in Note 11\n(Derivatives).\n\nTable 15.2: Offsetting \u2013 Securities

In these\ntransactions, we receive cash in exchange for\ntransferring securities as collateral and recognize\nan obligation to reacquire the securities for cash\nat the transaction\u2019s maturity. These types of\ntransactions create risks, including (1) the\ncounterparty may fail to return the securities at\nmaturity, (2) the fair value of the securities\ntransferred may decline below the amount of our\nobligation to reacquire the securities, and\ntherefore create an obligation for us to pledge\nadditional amounts, and (3) the counterparty may\naccelerate the maturity on demand, requiring us to\nreacquire the security prior to contractual\nmaturity. We attempt to mitigate these risks in\nvarious ways. Our collateral primarily consists of\nhighly liquid securities. In addition, we\nunderwrite and monitor the financial strength of\nour counterparties, monitor the fair value of\ncollateral pledged relative to contractually\nrequired repurchase amounts, and monitor that our\ncollateral is properly returned through the\nclearing and settlement process in advance of our\ncash repayment.

Basis\nof Presentation FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING Corporate\ntreasury manages a funds transfer pricing\nmethodology that considers interest rate risk,\nliquidity risk, and other product characteristics.\nOperating segments pay a funding charge for their\nassets and receive a funding credit for their\ndeposits, both of which are included in net\ninterest income. The net impact of the funding\ncharges or credits is recognized in corporate\ntreasury. REVENUE AND EXPENSE SHARING When lines of\nbusiness jointly serve customers, the line of\nbusiness that is responsible for providing the\nproduct or service recognizes revenue or expense\nwith a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost\nto the other line of business based on established\ninternal revenue-sharing agreements. When a line of\nbusiness uses a service provided by another line of\nbusiness or enterprise function (included in\nCorporate), expense is generally allocated based on\nthe cost and use of the service provided. TAXABLE-\nEQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS Taxable-equivalent\nadjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain\nloans and debt securities are included in net\ninterest income, while taxable-equivalent\nadjustments related to income tax credits for low-\nincome housing and renewable energy investments are\nincluded in noninterest income, in each case with\ncorresponding impacts to income tax expense\n(benefit). Adjustments are included in Corporate,\nCommercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment\nBanking and are eliminated to reconcile to the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated financial results.\n                                \n  Wells Fargo & Company    119  \n                                \n                                                   \n  Note 16:Operating Segments(continued)            \n                                                   \nTable 16.1 presents our results by operating\nsegment.\nTable 16.1: Operating Segments\n                                                   \n                                                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      5      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                                                   \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                                                   \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                                                   \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                         \u2026      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026    \n                                                   \n(1) In first quarter 2023, we adopted ASU 2018-12 \u2013\nFinancial Services \u2013 Insurance (Topic 944):\nTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-\nDuration Contracts .

We must calculate\nour risk-based capital ratios under both the\nStandardized and Advanced Approaches. The\nStandardized Approach applies assigned risk weights\nto broad risk categories, while the calculation of\nrisk-weighted assets (RWAs) under the Advanced\nApproach differs by requiring applicable banks to\nutilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies\nupon the use of internal credit models, and\nincludes an operational risk component.

Total leverage exposure\nconsists of total average assets, less goodwill and\nother permitted Tier 1 capital deductions (net of\ndeferred tax liabilities), plus certain off-balance\nsheet exposures.\n(2) The Tier 1 leverage ratio consists of Tier 1\ncapital divided by total average assets, excluding\ngoodwill and certain other items as determined\nunder the rule.\nAt March 31, 2023, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1),\nTier 1 and total capital ratio requirements for the\nCompany included a global systemically important\nbank (G-SIB) surcharge of 1.50%. The G-SIB\nsurcharge is not applicable to the Bank. In\naddition, the CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratio\nrequirements for the Company included a stress\ncapital buffer of 3.20% under the Standardized\nApproach and a capital conservation buffer of 2.50%\nunder the Advanced Approach. The capital ratio\nrequirements for the Bank included a capital\nconservation buffer of 2.50% under both the\nStandardized and Advanced Approaches. The Company\nis required to maintain these risk-based capital\nratios and to maintain an SLR of at least 5.00%\n(composed of a 3.00% minimum requirement plus a\nsupplementary leverage buffer of 2.00%) to avoid\nrestrictions on capital distributions and\ndiscretionary bonus payments. The Bank is required\nto maintain an SLR of at least 6.00% to be\nconsidered well-capitalized under applicable\nregulatory capital adequacy rules.
