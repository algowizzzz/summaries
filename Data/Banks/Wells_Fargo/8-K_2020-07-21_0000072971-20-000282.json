Under the terms of his offer letter\nentered into with the Company effective July\n17, 2020 , Mr. Santomassimo will receive a\nbase salary at an initial annual rate of\n$1,750,000. For the 2020 performance year, his\nminimum variable compensation will be\n$9,250,000, consisting of (i) an annual\nincentive award under the Wells Fargo Bonus\nPlan or other applicable annual bonus plan\n(\u201cBonus Plan\u201d) with an estimated target value\nof $1,750,000, and (ii) an annual long-term\nincentive award under the Company\u2019s Long-Term\nIncentive Compensation Plan (\u201cLTICP\u201d) with an\nestimated target value of $7,500,000, in each\ncase subject to (x) his continued employment\nthrough the grant date, (y) approval of the\nHuman Resources Committee of the Company\u2019s\nBoard of Directors (\u201cHRC\u201d), and (z) any\nvesting period and other terms and conditions\nof the Bonus Plan or the LTICP, as the case\nmay be, including any applicable award\nagreement.
