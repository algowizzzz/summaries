The methodology of     \n       determining tangible common equity     \n       may differ among companies.            \n  (1)  Management believes that return on     \n       average tangible common equity and     \n       tangible book value per common share,  \n       which utilize tangible common equity,  \n       are useful financial measures because  \n       they enable investors and others to    \n       assess the Company\u2019s use of equity.    \n       For additional information, including  \n       a corresponding reconciliation to      \n       generally accepted accounting          \n       principles (GAAP) financial measures,  \n       see the \u201cCapital Management \u2013          \n       Tangible Common Equity\u201d section in     \n       this Report.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       The efficiency ratio is noninterest    \n  (2)  expense divided by total revenue (net  \n       interest income and noninterest        \n       income).                               \n                                              \n                                              \n       Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP)    \n       is total revenue less noninterest      \n       expense. Management believes that      \n  (3)  PTPP is a useful financial measure     \n       because it enables investors and       \n       others to assess the Company\u2019s         \n       ability to generate capital to cover   \n       credit losses through a credit cycle.  \n                                              \n                                              \n       In second quarter 2020, diluted        \n       average common shares outstanding      \n  (4)  equaled average common shares          \n       outstanding because our securities     \n       convertible into common shares had an  \n       anti-dilutive effect.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Consumer and small business banking    \n  (5)  deposits are total deposits excluding  \n       mortgage escrow and wholesale          \n       deposits.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       The risk-based capital ratios were     \n       calculated under the lower of the      \n       Standardized or Advanced Approach      \n       determined pursuant to Basel III.      \n       Beginning January 1, 2018, the         \n       requirements for calculating common    \n       equity tier 1 and tier 1 capital,      \n       along with risk-weighted assets,       \n       became fully phased-in. Accordingly,   \n  (6)  the information presented reflects     \n       fully phased-in common equity tier 1   \n       capital, tier 1 capital and            \n       risk-weighted assets, but reflects     \n       total capital still in accordance      \n       with Transition Requirements.

We ranked\nfourth in both assets\nand in the market value\nof our common stock\namong all U.S. banks at\nJune 30, 2020 . Wells\nFargo\u2019s top priority\nremains meeting its\nregulatory requirements\nto build the right\nfoundation for all that\nlies ahead. To do that,\nthe Company is\ncommitting the\nresources necessary to\nensure that we operate\nwith the strongest\nbusiness practices and\ncontrols, maintain the\nhighest level of\nintegrity, and have an\nappropriate culture in\nplace. In response to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic,\nwe have been working\ndiligently to protect\nemployee safety while\ncontinuing to carry out\nWells Fargo\u2019s role as a\nprovider of critical\nand essential services\nto the public. We have\ntaken comprehensive\nsteps to help\ncustomers, employees\nand communities. For\nour customers, we have\nsuspended residential\nproperty foreclosure\nactivities, offered fee\nwaivers, and provided\npayment deferrals,\namong other actions.

As required by\nthe consent order, the\nCompany\u2019s Board of\nDirectors (Board)\nsubmitted to the FRB a\nplan to further enhance\nthe Board\u2019s governance\nand oversight of the\nCompany, and the\nCompany submitted to\nthe FRB a plan to\nfurther improve the\nCompany\u2019s compliance\nand operational risk\nmanagement program. The\nCompany continues to\nengage with the FRB as\nthe Company works to\naddress the consent\norder provisions. The\nconsent order also\nrequires the Company,\nfollowing the FRB\u2019s\nacceptance and approval\nof the plans and the\nCompany\u2019s adoption and\nimplementation of the\nplans, to complete an\ninitial third-party\nreview of the\nenhancements and\nimprovements provided\nfor in the plans. Until\nthis third-party review\nis complete and the\nplans are approved and\nimplemented to the\nsatisfaction of the\nFRB, the Company\u2019s\ntotal consolidated\nassets as defined under\nthe consent order will\nbe limited to the level\nas of December 31,\n2017. Compliance with\nthis asset cap is\nmeasured on a two-\nquarter daily average\nbasis to allow for\nmanagement of temporary\nfluctuations. Due to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic,\non April 8, 2020, the\nFRB amended the consent\norder to allow the\nCompany to exclude from\nthe asset cap any on-\nbalance sheet exposure\nresulting from loans\nmade by the Company in\nconnection with the\nSmall Business\nAdministration\u2019s\nPaycheck Protection\nProgram and the FRB\u2019s\nMain Street Lending\nProgram. As required\nunder the amendment to\nthe consent order,\ncertain fees and other\neconomic benefits\nreceived by the Company\nfrom loans made in\nconnection with these\nprograms shall be\ntransferred to the U.S.\nTreasury or to non-\nprofit organizations\napproved by the FRB\nthat support small\nbusinesses. After\nremoval of the asset\ncap, a second third-\nparty review must also\nbe conducted to assess\nthe efficacy and\nsustainability of the\nenhancements and\nimprovements. Consent\nOrders with the\nConsumer Financial\nProtection Bureau and\nOffice of the\nComptroller of the\nCurrency Regarding\nCompliance Risk\nManagement Program,\nAutomobile Collateral\nProtection Insurance\nPolicies, and Mortgage\nInterest Rate Lock\nExtensions On April 20,\n2018, the Company\nentered into consent\norders with the\nConsumer Financial\nProtection Bureau\n(CFPB) and the Office 3\n\nof the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (OCC) to\npay an aggregate of $1\nbillion in civil money\npenalties to resolve\nmatters regarding the\nCompany\u2019s compliance\nrisk management program\nand past practices\ninvolving certain\nautomobile collateral\nprotection insurance\n(CPI) policies and\ncertain mortgage\ninterest rate lock\nextensions. As required\nby the consent orders,\nthe Company submitted\nto the CFPB and OCC an\nenterprise-wide\ncompliance risk\nmanagement plan and a\nplan to enhance the\nCompany\u2019s internal\naudit program with\nrespect to federal\nconsumer financial law\nand the terms of the\nconsent orders. In\naddition, as required\nby the consent orders,\nthe Company submitted\nfor non-objection plans\nto remediate customers\naffected by the\nautomobile collateral\nprotection insurance\nand mortgage interest\nrate lock matters, as\nwell as a plan for the\nmanagement of\nremediation activities\nconducted by the\nCompany. Retail Sales\nPractices Matters In\nSeptember 2016, we\nannounced settlements\nwith the CFPB, the OCC,\nand the Office of the\nLos Angeles City\nAttorney, and entered\ninto related consent\norders with the CFPB\nand the OCC, in\nconnection with\nallegations that some\nof our retail customers\nreceived products and\nservices they did not\nrequest. As a result,\nit remains a top\npriority to rebuild\ntrust through a\ncomprehensive action\nplan that includes\nmaking things right for\nour customers, team\nmembers, and other\nstakeholders, and\nbuilding a better\nCompany for the future.\nOur priority of\nrebuilding trust has\nincluded numerous\nactions focused on\nidentifying potential\nfinancial harm to\ncustomers resulting\nfrom these matters and\nproviding remediation.\nFor additional\ninformation regarding\nretail sales practices\nmatters, including\nrelated legal matters,\nsee the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nsection in our 2019\nForm 10-K and Note 14\n(Legal Actions) to\nFinancial Statements in\nthis Report. Other\nCustomer Remediation\nActivities Our priority\nof rebuilding trust has\nalso included an effort\nto identify other areas\nor instances where\ncustomers may have\nexperienced financial\nharm, provide\nremediation as\nappropriate, and\nimplement additional\noperational and control\nprocedures. We are\nworking with our\nregulatory agencies in\nthis effort. We have\npreviously disclosed\nkey areas of focus as\npart of our rebuilding\ntrust efforts and are\nin the process of\nproviding remediation\nfor those matters. We\nhave accrued for the\nreasonably estimable\nremediation costs\nrelated to our\nrebuilding trust\nefforts, which amounts\nmay change based on\nadditional facts and\ninformation, as well as\nongoing reviews and\ncommunications with our\nregulators. As our\nongoing reviews\ncontinue, it is\npossible that in the\nfuture we may identify\nadditional items or\nareas of potential\nconcern. To the extent\nissues are identified,\nwe will continue to\nassess any customer\nharm and provide\nremediation as\nappropriate.

Our total\nassets were $1.97\ntrillion at June 30,\n2020 . Cash and other\nshort-term investments\nincreased $98.4 billion\nfrom December 31, 2019\n, reflecting an\nincrease in cash\nbalances, partially\noffset by lower federal\nfunds sold and\nsecurities purchased\nunder resale\nagreements. Debt\nsecurities decreased\n$24.5 billion from\nDecember 31, 2019 ,\npredominantly due to a\ndecrease in available-\nfor-sale debt\nsecurities, partially\noffset by an increase\nin held-to-maturity\ndebt securities. Loans\ndecreased $27.1 billion\nfrom December 31, 2019\n, due to paydowns in\nreal estate 1-4 family\nmortgage loans, credit\ncard loans, and\ncommercial and\nindustrial loans, as\nwell as the designation\nin second quarter 2020\nof real estate 1-4\nfamily mortgage loans\nas mortgage loans held\nfor sale (MLHFS). The\ndecrease in loans was\npartially offset by an\nincrease in commercial\nreal estate loans\ndriven by new\noriginations and draws\non construction loans.\nAverage deposits in\nsecond quarter 2020\nwere $1.39 trillion ,\nup $117.7 billion from\nsecond quarter 2019 ,\non growth across the\ndeposit gathering\nbusinesses reflecting\ncustomers\u2019 preferences\nfor liquidity due to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\nCredit Quality Credit\nquality declined due to\nthe economic impact\nthat the COVID-19\npandemic had on our\ncustomer base. Net loan\ncharge-offs were $1.1\nbillion , or 0.46%\n(annualized) of average\nloans, in second\nquarter 2020 , compared\nwith $653 million a\nyear ago ( 0.28%\n)(annualized). Our\ncommercial portfolio\nnet loan charge-offs\nwere $602 million , or\n44 basis points\n(annualized) of average\ncommercial loans, in\nsecond quarter 2020 ,\ncompared with net loan\ncharge-offs of $165\nmillion , or 13 basis\npoints (annualized), a\nyear ago, predominantly\ndriven by increased\nlosses in our\ncommercial and\nindustrial and\ncommercial real estate\nloan portfolios. The\nincreased losses in our\ncommercial and\nindustrial portfolio\nwere primarily related\nto higher net loan\ncharge-offs in our oil\nand gas portfolio. Our\nconsumer portfolio net\nloan charge-offs were\n$511 million , or 48\nbasis points\n(annualized) of average\nconsumer loans, in\nsecond quarter 2020 ,\ncompared with net loan\ncharge-offs of $488\nmillion , or 45 basis\npoints (annualized), a\nyear ago, predominantly\ndriven by increased\nlosses in our\nresidential real estate\nand automobile loan\nportfolios, partially\noffset by lower losses\nin our credit card and\nother revolving credit\nand installment loan\nportfolios. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses (ACL) for loans\nof $20.4 billion at\nJune 30, 2020 ,\nincreased $9.8 billion\n, compared with a year\nago, and increased\n$10.0 billion from\nDecember 31, 2019 . We\nhad a $11.4 billion\nincrease in the\nallowance for credit\nlosses for loans in the\nfirst half of 2020 ,\npartially offset by a\n$1.3 billion decrease\nas a result of our\nadoption on January 1,\n2020, of Accounting\nStandards Update (ASU)\n2016-13, Financial\nInstruments \u2013 Credit\nLosses (Topic 326):\nMeasurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial\n\n4 Overview (continued)\nInstruments (CECL).

The\nallowance covered 4.6\ntimes annualized net\nloan charge-offs in\nsecond quarter 2020 ,\ncompared with 4.0 times\nin second quarter 2019.\nOur provision for\ncredit losses for loans\nwas $9.6 billion in\nsecond quarter 2020 ,\nup from $503 million a\nyear ago. The increase\nin the allowance for\ncredit losses for loans\nand the provision for\ncredit losses reflected\ncurrent and forecasted\neconomic conditions due\nto the COVID-19\npandemic. Nonperforming\nassets (NPAs) at June\n30, 2020 , of $7.8\nbillion , increased\n$1.4 billion , or 22% ,\nfrom March 31, 2020 ,\nand $2.2 billion , or\n38% , from December 31,\n2019 , and represented\n0.83% of total loans at\nJune 30, 2020 .\nNonaccrual loans\nincreased $1.4 billion\nfrom March 31, 2020 ,\ndue to increases in\ncommercial loans driven\nby the oil and gas\nportfolio and increases\nin real estate mortgage\nloans, as the economic\nimpact of the COVID-19\npandemic continued to\nimpact our customer\nbase. Foreclosed assets\ndecreased $57 million\nfrom March 31, 2020 .\nFor information on how\nwe are assisting our\ncustomers in response\nto the COVID-19\npandemic, see the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Credit\nRisk Management\u201d\nsection in this Report.\nCapital We maintained a\nsolid capital position\nin the first half of\n2020 , with total\nequity of $180.1\nbillion at June 30,\n2020 , compared with\n$188.0 billion at\nDecember 31, 2019 . We\nreduced our common\nshares outstanding by\n14.9 million shares\nfrom December 31, 2019,\nthrough share\nrepurchases, partially\noffset by issuances and\nconversions of\npreferred shares. On\nMarch 15, 2020, we,\nalong with the other\nmembers of the\nFinancial Services\nForum (which consists\nof the eight largest\nand most diversified\nfinancial institutions\nheadquartered in the\nU.S.), decided to\ntemporarily suspend\nshare repurchases for\nthe remainder of the\nfirst quarter and for\nsecond quarter 2020 .\nOn June 25, 2020, the\nFRB announced that it\nwas prohibiting large\nbank holding companies\n(BHCs) subject to the\nFRB\u2019s capital plan\nrule, including Wells\nFargo, from making any\ncapital distribution\n(excluding any capital\ndistribution arising\nfrom the issuance of a\ncapital instrument\neligible for inclusion\nin the numerator of a\nregulatory capital\nratio), unless\notherwise approved by\nthe FRB. Through the\nend of third quarter\n2020, the FRB\nauthorized certain\nlimited exceptions to\nthis prohibition, which\nare described in the\n\u201cCapital Management \u2013\nCapital Planning and\nStress Testing\u201d section\nin this Report. In\nfirst quarter 2020, we\nissued $2.0 billion of\nNon-Cumulative\nPerpetual Class A\nPreferred Stock, Series\nZ. Additionally, we\nredeemed the remaining\n$1.8 billion of our\nFixed-to-Floating Rate\nNon-Cumulative\nPerpetual Class A\nPreferred Stock, Series\nK. We also redeemed\n$669 million of our\nNon-Cumulative\nPerpetual Class A\nPreferred Stock, Series\nT. On July 28, 2020,\nthe Company reduced its\nthird quarter 2020\ncommon stock dividend\nto $0.10 per share. We\nbelieve an important\nmeasure of our capital\nstrength is the Common\nEquity Tier 1 (CET1)\nratio, which was 10.97%\nat June 30, 2020 , down\nfrom 11.14% at December\n31, 2019 , but still\nabove our internal\ntarget of 10% and the\nregulatory minimum of\n9%. As of June 30, 2020\n, our eligible external\ntotal loss absorbing\ncapacity (TLAC) as a\npercentage of total\nrisk-weighted assets\nwas 25.33% , compared\nwith the required\nminimum of 22.0%.\nLikewise, our other\nregulatory capital\nratios remained strong.\nSee the \u201cCapital\nManagement\u201d section in\nthis Report for more\ninformation regarding\nour capital, including\nthe calculation of our\nregulatory capital\namounts. 5\n                        \n  Earnings Performance  \n                        \nWells Fargo net loss\nfor second quarter 2020\nwas $2.4 billion (\n$0.66 diluted loss per\ncommon share), compared\nwith net income of $6.2\nbillion ( $1.30 diluted\nincome per common\nshare) in the same\nperiod a year ago. Net\nincome decreased to a\nnet loss in second\nquarter 2020 , compared\nwith the same period a\nyear ago, due to a $2.2\nbillion decrease in net\ninterest income, a $9.0\nbillion increase in our\nprovision for credit\nlosses, a $1.5 billion\ndecrease in noninterest\nincome, and a $1.1\nbillion increase in\nnoninterest expense,\npartially offset by a\n$5.2 billion decrease\nin income tax expense.\nNet loss for the first\nhalf of 2020 was $1.7\nbillion , compared with\nnet income of $12.1\nbillion in the same\nperiod a year ago. Net\nincome decreased to a\nnet loss in the first\nhalf of 2020 , compared\nwith the same period a\nyear ago, due to a $3.2\nbillion decrease in net\ninterest income, a\n$12.2 billion increase\nin our provision for\ncredit losses, a $4.4\nbillion decrease in\nnoninterest income, and\na $234 million increase\nin noninterest expense,\npartially offset by a\n$5.9 billion decrease\nin income tax expense.\nRevenue, the sum of net\ninterest income and\nnoninterest income, was\n$17.8 billion in second\nquarter 2020 , compared\nwith $21.6 billion in\nthe same period a year\nago. Revenue for the\nfirst half of 2020 was\n$35.6 billion ,\ncompared with $43.2\nbillion in the same\nperiod a year ago. Net\ninterest income\nrepresented 55% of\nrevenue in second\nquarter 2020 , compared\nwith 56% in the same\nperiod a year ago, and\n60% of revenue in the\nfirst half of 2020 ,\ncompared with 57% in\nthe same period a year\nago. Noninterest income\nrepresented 45% of\nrevenue in second\nquarter 2020 , compared\nwith 44% in the same\nperiod a year ago, and\n40% of revenue in the\nfirst half of 2020 ,\ncompared with 43% in\nthe same period a year\nago. 6 Earnings\nPerformance ( continued\n)\n\nNet Interest Income Net\ninterest income is the\ninterest earned on debt\nsecurities, loans\n(including yield-\nrelated loan fees) and\nother interest-earning\nassets minus the\ninterest paid on\ndeposits, short-term\nborrowings and long-\nterm debt. The net\ninterest margin is the\naverage yield on\nearning assets minus\nthe average interest\nrate paid for deposits\nand our other sources\nof funding. Net\ninterest income and the\nnet interest margin are\npresented on a taxable-\nequivalent basis in\nTable 1 to consistently\nreflect income from\ntaxable and tax-exempt\nloans and debt and\nequity securities based\non a 21% federal\nstatutory tax rate for\nthe periods ending June\n30, 2020 and 2019 . Net\ninterest income and the\nnet interest margin in\nany one period can be\nsignificantly affected\nby a variety of factors\nincluding the mix of\nearning assets in our\nportfolio, the overall\nsize of our earning\nassets portfolio, and\nthe cost of funding\nthose assets. In\naddition, variable\nsources of interest\nincome, such as loan\nfees, periodic\ndividends, and\ncollection of interest\non nonaccrual loans,\ncan fluctuate from\nperiod to period. Net\ninterest income on a\ntaxable-equivalent\nbasis was $10.0 billion\nand $21.5 billion in\nthe second quarter and\nfirst half of 2020 ,\nrespectively, compared\nwith $12.3 billion and\n$24.7 billion for the\nsame periods a year\nago. Net interest\nmargin on a taxable-\nequivalent basis was\n2.25% and 2.42% in the\nsecond quarter and\nfirst half of 2020 ,\nrespectively, compared\nwith 2.82% and 2.86%\nfor the same periods a\nyear ago. The decrease\nin net interest income\nand net interest margin\nin the second quarter\nand first half of 2020\n, compared with the\nsame periods a year\nago, was driven by\nunfavorable impacts of\nrepricing due to lower\nmarket rates and\nchanges in mix of\nearning assets and\nfunding sources,\nincluding sales of high\nyielding Pick-a-Pay\nloans in 2019. Average\nearning assets\nincreased $40.0 billion\nin second quarter 2020\n, compared with the\nsame period a year ago.\nThe change was driven\nby increases in:\n                                              \n  \u2022  average interest-earning deposits with   \n     banks of$35.3 billion;                   \n                                              \n                                     \n  \u2022  average loans of$23.8 billion;  \n                                     \n                                              \n  \u2022  average mortgage loans held for sale     \n     of$7.5 billion; and                      \n                                              \n                                           \n  \u2022  other earning assets of$3.0 billion;  \n                                           \npartially offset by\ndecreases in:\n                                              \n     average federal funds sold and           \n  \u2022  securities purchased under resale        \n     agreements of$21.7 billion; and          \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  average equity securities of$7.8         \n     billion.                                 \n                                              \nAverage earning assets\nincreased $44.9 billion\nin the first half of\n2020 , compared with\nthe same period a year\nago.

Card fees\ndecreased $228 million\nand $280 million in the\nsecond quarter and\nfirst half of 2020 ,\nrespectively, compared\nwith the same periods a\nyear ago. The decrease\nin the second quarter\nand first half of 2020\n, compared with the\nsame periods a year\nago, was due to lower\ninterchange fees driven\nby decreased purchase\nvolume due to the\nimpact of the COVID-19\npandemic, and higher\nfee waivers as part of\nour actions to support\ncustomers during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic,\npartially offset by\nlower rewards costs.\nOther fees decreased\n$222 million and $360\nmillion in the second\nquarter and first half\nof 2020 , respectively,\ncompared with the same\nperiods a year ago,\ndriven by a decline in\ncommission fees as a\nresult of the sale of\nour commercial real\nestate brokerage\nbusiness, Eastdil\nSecured (Eastdil), in\nfourth quarter 2019,\nand lower business\npayroll income due to\nthe sale of our\nBusiness Payroll\nServices business in\nfirst quarter 2019.\nAdditionally, we waived\nor reversed certain\nlending related charges\nor fees as part of our\nactions to support\ncustomers during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic,\nwhich also negatively\nimpacted other fees.\nMortgage banking\nnoninterest income,\nconsisting of net\nservicing income and\nnet gains on mortgage\nloan origination/ sales\nactivities, decreased\n$441 million and $770\nmillion in the second\nquarter and first half\nof 2020 , respectively,\ncompared with the same\nperiods a year ago. For\nmore information, see\nNote 11 (Mortgage\nBanking Activities) to\nFinancial Statements in\nthis Report. Our\nportfolio of loans\nserviced for others was\n$1.6 trillion at both\nJune 30, 2020 , and\nDecember 31, 2019 .

Net servicing\nincome decreased $1.0\nbillion and $1.1\nbillion in the second\nquarter and first half\nof 2020 , respectively,\ncompared with the same\nperiods a year ago. The\ndecrease in net\nservicing income in the\nsecond quarter and\nfirst half of 2020 ,\ncompared with the same\nperiods a year ago, was\ndriven by MSR valuation\nlosses, net of hedge\nresults, reflecting\nhigher expected\nservicing costs and\nupdates to other\nvaluation model\nassumptions affecting\nprepayment estimates\nthat are independent of\ninterest rate changes,\nsuch as changes in home\nprices and in customer\ncredit profiles. The\ndecrease in net\nservicing income in the\nsecond quarter and\nfirst half of 2020 also\nreflected continued\nprepayments and the\nimpacts of customer\naccommodations\nassociated with the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.

Net\ngains on mortgage loan\norigination/sales\nactivities increased\n$525 million and $289\nmillion in the second\nquarter and first half\nof 2020 , respectively,\ncompared with the same\nperiods a year ago, due\nto higher residential\nreal estate held for\nsale origination\nvolumes and margins.\nThe production margin\non residential held for\nsale mortgage loan\noriginations, which\nrepresents net gains on\nresidential mortgage\nloan origination/sales\nactivities divided by\ntotal residential held\nfor sale mortgage loan\noriginations, provides\na measure of the\nprofitability of our\nresidential mortgage\norigination activity .\nThe increase in the\nproduction margin in\nthe second quarter and\nfirst half of 2020 ,\ncompared with the same\nperiods a year ago, was\ndue to higher margins\nin both our retail and\ncorrespondent\nproduction channels, as\nwell as a shift to more\n\nretail origination\nvolume, which has a\nhigher margin.

The increase in second\nquarter 2020 , compared with the same period a\nyear ago, was driven by higher deferred\ncompensation expense (offset in net gains from\nequity securities), and higher salaries\nexpense. The decrease in the first half of\n2020 , compared with the same period a year\nago, was driven by lower deferred compensation\nexpense (offset in net losses from equity\nsecurities), partially offset by an increase\nin salaries and employee benefits expense. The\nsecond quarter and first half of 2020 also\nreflected higher salaries driven by annual\nsalary increases and higher staffing levels,\nas well as increased employee benefits and\nincentive compensation expense related to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, including additional\npayments for certain customer-facing and\nsupport employees and back-up childcare\nservices. Table 3a presents results for our\ndeferred compensation plan and related hedges.\nHistorically, we used equity securities as\neconomic hedges of our deferred compensation\nplan liabilities. Changes in the fair value of\nthe equity securities used as economic hedges\nwere recorded in net gains (losses) from\nequity securities within noninterest income.\nIn second quarter 2020 , we entered into\narrangements to transition our economic hedges\nfrom equity securities to derivative\ninstruments. Changes in fair value of\nderivatives used as economic hedges are\npresented within the same financial statement\nline as the related business activity being\nhedged. As a result of this transition, we\npresented the net gains/(losses) on\nderivatives from economic hedges on the\ndeferred compensation plan liabilities in\npersonnel expense.

Outside professional and contract\nservices expense decreased $19 million in\nsecond quarter 2020 , compared with the same\nperiod a year ago, and increased $85 million\nin the first half of 2020 , compared with the\nsame period a year ago. The decrease in second\nquarter 2020 , compared with the same period a\nyear ago, was due to lower legal expenses and\nreduced project spending. The increase in the\nfirst half of 2020 , compared with the same\nperiod a year ago, was due to an increase in\nproject spending, partially offset by lower\nlegal expenses. Advertising and promotion\nexpense decreased $192 million and $248\nmillion in the second quarter and first half\nof 2020 , respectively, compared with the same\nperiods a year ago, driven by decreases in\nmarketing and brand campaign volumes due to\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Travel\nand entertainment expense decreased $148\nmillion and $202 million i n the second\nquarter and first half of 2020 , respectively,\ncompared with the same periods a year ago,\ndriven by a reduction in business travel and\ncompany events due to ongoing expense\nmanagement initiatives, as well as the impact\nof the COVID-19 pandemic. All other expense\nincreased $69 million in second quarter 2020 ,\ncompared with the same period a year ago, and\ndecreased $61 million in the first half of\n2020 , compared with the same period a year\nago. The increase in second quarter 2020 ,\ncompared with the same period a year ago, was\ndue to higher pension plan settlement expenses\nand lower gains on the extinguishment of debt,\npartially offset by a reduction in the\ninsurance claims reserve and lower pension\nbenefit plan expenses. The decrease in the\nfirst half of 2020 , compared with the same\nperiod a year ago, was due to a reduction in\nthe insurance claims reserve and lower pension\nbenefit plan expenses, partially offset by\nhigher pension plan settlement expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense Income tax benefit was $3.9\nbillion and $3.8 billion in the second quarter\nand first half of 2020 , respectively,\ncompared with income tax expense of $1.3\nbillion and $2.2 billion in the same periods a\nyear ago. The decrease in income tax expense\nto an income tax benefit in both the second\nquarter and first half of 2020 , compared with\nthe same periods a year ago, was driven by\nlower income. Our effective income tax rate\nwas 62.2% and 68.5% for the second quarter and\nfirst half of 2020 , respectively, compared\nwith 17.3% and 15.3% for the same periods a\nyear ago. The higher rate in second quarter\n2020, compared with the same period a year\nago, reflected the impact of annual income tax\nbenefits, primarily tax credits, driven by the\nreported pre-tax loss, and included net\ndiscrete income tax benefits of $98 million\npredominantly related to the resolution of\nprior period U.S. federal income tax matters.\n13 Operating Segment Results As of June 30,\n2020, we were organized for management\nreporting purposes into three operating\nsegments: Community Banking; Wholesale\nBanking; and Wealth and Investment Management\n(WIM). These segments are defined by product\ntype and customer segment and their results\nare based on our management reporting process.\nThe management reporting process is based on\nU.S. GAAP with specific adjustments, such as\nfor funds transfer pricing for asset/liability\nmanagement, for shared revenues and expenses,\nand tax-equivalent adjustments to consistently\nreflect income from taxable and tax-exempt\nsources. On February 11, 2020, we announced a\nnew organizational structure with five\nprincipal lines of business: Consumer and\nSmall Business Banking; Consumer Lending;\nCommercial Banking; Corporate and Investment\nBanking; and Wealth and Investment Management.\nThis new organizational structure is intended\nto help drive operating, control, and business\nperformance. In July 2020, the Company\ncompleted the transition to this new\norganizational structure, including finalizing\nleadership for these principal business lines\nand aligning management reporting and\nallocation methodologies. These changes will\nnot impact the consolidated financial results\nof the Company. Accordingly, we will update\nour operating segment disclosures, including\ncomparative financial results, in third\nquarter 2020. Table 4 and the following\ndiscussion present our results by operating\nsegment. For additional description of our\noperating segments, including additional\nfinancial information and the underlying\nmanagement reporting process, see Note 22\n(Operating Segments) to Financial Statements\nin this Report. We perform a goodwill\nimpairment assessment annually in the fourth\nquarter. However, in second quarter 2020, we\nperformed another interim, quantitative\nimpairment assessment of our goodwill given\ndeteriorated macroeconomic conditions from the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These market\nconditions led to a sharp decline in share\nprices for Wells Fargo and other companies\nacross many industries. As part of our interim\nassessment, we updated our assumptions used in\nboth the income and market approaches for\nestimating fair values of our reporting units.\nThe update to assumptions incorporated current\nmarket-based information such as price-\nearnings information and a regular update to\nour internal enterprise-wide forecasts, which\nreflected lower interest rates and higher\nexpected credit losses, as well as a weaker\nmacroeconomic outlook. Since our annual\nassessment, we have observed declines in the\nfair values of our reporting units and the\namount of excess fair value over the carrying\namount of our reporting units; however, we did\nnot have evidence of goodwill impairment as of\nJune 30, 2020. The fair value of each\nreporting unit exceeded its corresponding\ncarrying amount by 18% or higher. The\nestimated fair value of our corporate and\ninvestment banking reporting unit, included\nwithin the Wholesale Banking operating\nsegment, increased in second quarter 2020 as\nit reflected recent updates in price-earnings\ninformation used in our market approach\nvaluations. The increase in fair value\nresulted in significant excess fair value over\nthe carrying amount for the reporting unit\ncompared with the prior quarter. The aggregate\nfair value of our reporting units exceeded our\nmarket capitalization as of June 30, 2020. Our\nindividual reporting unit fair values cannot\nbe directly correlated to the Company\u2019s market\ncapitalization. However, we considered several\nfactors in the comparison of aggregate fair\nvalue to market capitalization, including (i)\ncontrol premiums adjusted for the current\nmarket environment, which include synergies\nthat may not be reflected in current market\npricing, (ii) degree of complexity and\nexecution risk at the reporting unit level\ncompared with the enterprise level, and (iii)\nissues or risks related to the Company level\nthat may not be included in the fair value of\nthe individual reporting units. Given the\nuncertainty of the severity or length of the\ncurrent economic downturn, we will continue to\nmonitor our performance against our internal\nforecasts as well as market conditions for\ncircumstances that could have a further\nnegative effect on the estimated fair values\nof our reporting units. In connection with the\nplanned change to our operating segment\ndisclosures, we will realign our goodwill to\nthe reporting units that underlie our\noperating segments, which could impact the\nresults of our goodwill impairment assessment.\nWe will reassess goodwill for impairment at\nthe time of the realignment.

Revenue decreased $3.0\nbillion and $5.3 billion in the second quarter\nand first half of 2020 , respectively,\ncompared with the same periods a year ago. The\ndecrease in the second quarter and first half\nof 2020 , compared with the same periods a\nyear ago, was driven by lower net interest\nincome reflecting the lower interest rate\nenvironment and lower noninterest income\nreflecting lower fees from reduced consumer\nspending and transaction activity due to the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially\noffset by higher net gains on debt securities.\nThe decrease in the first half of 2020 ,\ncompared with the same period a year ago, also\nreflected net losses on equity securities\n(including lower deferred compensation plan\ninvestment results, which were largely offset\nin personnel expense). The provision for\ncredit losses increased $2.9 billion and $3.9\nbillion in the second quarter and first half\nof 2020 , respectively, compared with the same\nperiods a year ago, due to increases in the\nallowance for credit losses reflecting current\nand forecasted economic conditions due to the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Noninterest\nexpense increased $1.1 billion and $561\nmillion in the second quarter and first half\nof 2020 , respectively, compared with the same\nperiods a year ago. The increase in the second\nquarter and first half of 2020 , compared with\nthe same periods a year ago, was due to higher\noperating losses, occupancy expense, outside\nprofessional services expense, and technology\nand equipment expense, partially offset by\nlower other expenses. The increase in second\nquarter 2020 , compared with the same period a\nyear ago, also reflected higher personnel\nexpense. 15 Average loans decreased $8.4\nbillion and $1.9 billion in the second quarter\nand first half of 2020 , respectively,\ncompared with the same periods a year ago. The\ndecrease in second quarter 2020 , compared\nwith the same period a year ago, was driven by\nlower real estate 1-4 family first mortgage\nloans and lower junior lien mortgage loans,\npartially offset by higher commercial loans.\nThe decrease in the first half of 2020 ,\ncompared with the same period a year ago, was\ndue to lower junior lien mortgage loans,\npartially offset by higher automobile loans.\nAverage deposits increased $70.9 billion and\n$51.9 billion , in the second quarter and\nfirst half of 2020 , respectively, compared\nwith the same periods a year ago, driven by\ncustomers\u2019 preferences for liquidity due to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.

Net interest income\ndecreased $644 million and $1.0 billion in the\nsecond quarter and first half of 2020 ,\nrespectively, compared with the same periods a\nyear ago, driven by the impact of the lower\ninterest rate environment, partially offset by\nhigher average deposit balances and higher\naverage loan balances. Noninterest income\nincreased $142 million in second quarter 2020,\ncompared with the same period a year ago, due\nto increased market sensitive revenue\n(represents net gains (losses) from trading\nactivities, debt securities, and equity\nsecurities) and investment banking fees,\npartially offset by lower other noninterest\nincome including lower lease income, and lower\ncommercial real estate brokerage fees within\nother fees related to our sale of Eastdil in\nfourth quarter 2019. Noninterest income\ndecreased $754 million in the first half of\n2020 , compared with the same period a year\nago, due to lower other income from higher\namortization on renewable energy and community\nlending investments and lower lease income,\nlower other fees related to our sale of\nEastdil, and lower mortgage banking fees,\npartially offset by higher investment banking\nfees. The provision for credit losses\nincreased $6.0 billion and $8.2 billion in the\nsecond quarter and first half of 2020 ,\nrespectively, compared with the same periods a\nyear ago, due to increases in the allowance\nfor credit losses reflecting current and 16\nEarnings Performance ( continued ) forecasted\neconomic conditions due to the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and higher charge-offs in\nthe oil and gas and commercial real estate\nportfolios. Noninterest expense increased $81\nmillion and $6 million in the second quarter\nand first half of 2020 , respectively,\ncompared with the same periods a year ago. The\nincrease in second quarter 2020 , compared\nwith the same period a year ago, was driven by\nhigher operating losses primarily due to\nlitigation accruals, partially offset by lower\npersonnel expense. The increase in the first\nhalf of 2020 , compared with the same period a\nyear ago, was due to higher operating losses\nand increased regulatory and risk related\nexpense within other noninterest expense,\npartially offset by lower personnel expense,\nand lower lease and travel expenses within\nother noninterest expense, as well as the\nimpact of the sale of Eastdil in fourth\nquarter 2019.

The decrease in\nsecond quarter 2020 , compared with the same\nperiod a year ago, 17 was driven by lower\nasset-based fees and lower brokerage\ntransaction revenue, partially offset by net\ngains from equity securities driven by an\nincrease in deferred compensation plan\ninvestment results (largely offset by lower\npersonnel expense). The decrease in the first\nhalf of 2020 , compared with the same period a\nyear ago, was driven by net losses from equity\nsecurities driven by a decline in deferred\ncompensation plan investment results (largely\noffset by lower personnel expense) and lower\ntrust and investment management income,\npartially offset by higher retail brokerage\nadvisory fees (priced at the beginning of the\nquarter). The provision for credit losses\nincreased $258 million and $262 million in the\nsecond quarter and first half of 2020 ,\nrespectively, compared with the same periods a\nyear ago, driven by current and forecasted\neconomic conditions due to the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Noninterest expense\ndecreased $93 million and $293 million in the\nsecond quarter and first half of 2020 ,\nrespectively, compared with the same periods a\nyear ago. The decrease in second quarter 2020\n, compared with the same period a year ago,\nwas driven by lower personnel expense from\nlower commissions and other incentive\ncompensation, and lower technology and\nequipment expense related to the reversal of\nan accrual for software costs, partially\noffset by higher project spending on\nregulatory and compliance related initiatives\nincluded within other noninterest expense and\nhigher deferred compensation plan expense\nwithin personnel expense (largely offset by\nnet gains from equity securities). The\ndecrease in the first half of 2020 , compared\nwith the same period a year ago, was due to\nlower personnel expense driven by lower\ndeferred compensation plan expense (largely\noffset by net losses from equity securities)\nand incentive compensation, and lower\ntechnology and equipment expense related to\nthe reversal of an accrual for software costs,\npartially offset by higher project spending on\nregulatory and compliance related initiatives\nincluded within other noninterest expense and\nhigher broker commissions within personnel\nexpense. Average loans increased $3.7 billion\nand $3.9 billion in the second quarter and\nfirst half of 2020 , respectively, compared\nwith the same periods a year ago, driven by\ngrowth in real estate 1-4 first mortgage\nloans. Average deposits increased $28.3\nbillion and $13.3 billion in the second\nquarter and first half of 2020 , respectively,\ncompared with the same periods a year ago,\nprimarily due to growth in brokerage clients\u2019\ncash balances.

Retail Brokerage Client Assets\nBrokerage advisory, commissions and other fees\nare received for providing full-service and\ndiscount brokerage services predominantly to\nretail brokerage clients. Offering advisory\naccount relationships to our brokerage clients\nis an important component of our broader\nstrategy of meeting their financial needs.\nAlthough a majority of our retail brokerage\nclient assets are in accounts that earn\nbrokerage commissions, the fees from those\naccounts generally represent transactional\ncommissions based on the number and size of\ntransactions executed at the client\u2019s\ndirection. Fees from advisory accounts are\nbased on a percentage of the market value of\nthe assets as of the beginning of the quarter,\nwhich vary across the account types based on\nthe distinct services provided, and are\naffected by investment performance as well as\nasset inflows and outflows. A majority of our\nbrokerage advisory, commissions and other fee\nincome is earned from advisory accounts.

Total\nprovision/(reversal of\nprovision) for credit\nlosses on debt\nsecurities was $(31)\nmillion and $141\nmillion in the second\nquarter and first half\nof 2020 . For a\ndiscussion of our\naccounting policies\nrelating to the\nallowance for credit\nlosses on debt\nsecurities and\nunderlying\nconsiderations and\nanalysis, see Note 1\n(Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies)\nand Note 5 (Available-\nfor-Sale and Held-to-\nMaturity Debt\nSecurities) to\nFinancial Statements in\nthis Report. At June\n30, 2020 , debt\nsecurities included\n$47.3 billion of\nmunicipal bonds, of\nwhich 97.7% were rated\n\u201cA-\u201d or better based\npredominantly on\nexternal ratings.\nAdditionally, some of\nthe debt securities in\nour total municipal\nbond portfolio are\nguaranteed against loss\nby bond insurers. These\nguaranteed bonds are\npredominantly\ninvestment grade and\nwere generally\nunderwritten in\naccordance with our own\ninvestment standards\nprior to the\ndetermination to\npurchase, without\nrelying on the bond\ninsurer\u2019s guarantee in\nmaking the investment\ndecision. The credit\nquality of our\nmunicipal bond holdings\nare monitored as part\nof our ongoing\nevaluation of the\nappropriateness of the\nallowance for credit\nlosses on debt\nsecurities. The\nweighted-average\nexpected maturity of\ndebt securities\navailable-for-sale was\n4.3 years at June 30,\n2020 . The expected\n\nremaining maturity is\nshorter than the\nremaining contractual\nmaturity for the 65% of\nthis portfolio that is\nmortgage-backed\nsecurities (MBS)\nbecause borrowers\ngenerally have the\nright to prepay\nobligations before the\nunderlying mortgages\nmature.

Equity\nTotal equity was $180.1 billion at June 30,\n2020 , compared with $188.0 billion at\nDecember 31, 2019 . The decrease was driven by\ncommon stock repurchases of $3.4 billion\n(substantially all of which occurred in first\nquarter 2020), preferred stock redemptions of\n$2.5 billion , dividends of $4.8 billion , and\na net loss of $1.8 billion , partially offset\nby the issuance of common and preferred stock\nof $4.0 billion .\n\n22\n                                  \n  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  \n                                  \nIn the ordinary course of business, we engage\nin financial transactions that are not\nrecorded on the balance sheet, or may be\nrecorded on the balance sheet in amounts that\nare different from the full contract or\nnotional amount of the transaction. Our off-\nbalance sheet arrangements include commitments\nto lend and purchase debt and equity\nsecurities, transactions with unconsolidated\nentities, guarantees, derivatives, and other\ncommitments. These transactions are designed\nto (1) meet the financial needs of customers,\n(2) manage our credit, market or liquidity\nrisks, and/or (3) diversify our funding\nsources. For additional information on our\ncontractual obligations that may require\nfuture cash payments, see the \u201cOff-Balance\nSheet Arrangements \u2013 Contractual Cash\nObligations\u201d section in our 2019 Form 10-K.\nCommitments to Lend We enter into commitments\nto lend to customers, which are usually at a\nstated interest rate, if funded, and for\nspecific purposes and time periods. When we\nenter into commitments, we are exposed to\ncredit risk. The maximum credit risk for these\ncommitments will generally be lower than the\ncontractual amount because a significant\nportion of these commitments are not funded.\nFor more information, see Note 6 (Loans and\nRelated Allowance for Credit Losses) to\nFinancial Statements in this Report.\nCommitments to Purchase Debt and Equity\nSecurities We enter into commitments to\npurchase securities under resale agreements.\nWe also may enter into commitments to purchase\ndebt and equity securities to provide capital\nfor customers\u2019 funding, liquidity or other\nfuture needs. For more information, see Note\n13 (Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral,\nand Other Commitments) to Financial Statements\nin this Report. Transactions with\nUnconsolidated Entities In the normal course\nof business, we enter into various types of\non- and off-balance sheet transactions with\nspecial purpose entities (SPEs), which are\ncorporations, trusts, limited liability\ncompanies or partnerships that are established\nfor a limited purpose. Generally, SPEs are\nformed in connection with securitization\ntransactions and are considered variable\ninterest entities (VIEs). For more\ninformation, see Note 10 (Securitizations and\nVariable Interest Entities) to Financial\nStatements in this Report. Guarantees and\nOther Arrangements Guarantees are contracts\nthat contingently require us to make payments\nto a guaranteed party based on an event or a\nchange in an underlying asset, liability, rate\nor index. Guarantees are generally in the form\nof standby letters of credit, direct pay\nletters of credit, written options, recourse\nobligations, exchange and clearing house\nguarantees, indemnifications, and other types\nof similar arrangements. For more information,\nsee Note 13 (Guarantees, Pledged Assets and\nCollateral, and Other Commitments) to\nFinancial Statements in this Report.\nDerivatives We use derivatives to manage\nexposure to market risk, including interest\nrate risk, credit risk and foreign currency\nrisk, and to assist customers with their risk\nmanagement objectives. Derivatives are\nrecorded on the balance sheet at fair value,\nand volume can be measured in terms of the\nnotional amount, which is generally not\nexchanged, but is used only as the basis on\nwhich interest and other payments are\ndetermined. The notional amount is not\nrecorded on the balance sheet and is not, when\nviewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of\nthe risk profile of the instruments. For more\ninformation, see Note 15 (Derivatives) to\nFinancial Statements in this Report. 23\n                                              \n               Risk Management                \n                                              \nWells Fargo manages a\nvariety of risks that\ncan significantly\naffect our financial\nperformance and our\nability to meet the\nexpectations of our\ncustomers,\nshareholders,\nregulators and other\nstakeholders. For more\ninformation about how\nwe manage risk, see the\n\u201cRisk Management\u201d\nsection in our 2019\nForm 10-K. The\ndiscussion that follows\nsupplements our\ndiscussion of the\nmanagement of certain\nrisks contained in the\n\u201cRisk Management\u201d\nsection in our 2019\nForm 10-K. Credit Risk\nManagement We define\ncredit risk as the risk\nof loss associated with\na borrower or\ncounterparty default\n(failure to meet\nobligations in\naccordance with agreed\nupon terms). Credit\nrisk exists with many\nof our assets and\nexposures such as debt\nsecurity holdings,\ncertain derivatives,\nand loans. The Board\u2019s\nCredit Committee has\nprimary oversight\nresponsibility for\ncredit risk. At the\nmanagement level,\nCredit Risk, which is\npart of the Company\u2019s\nIndependent Risk\nManagement (IRM)\norganization, has\nprimary oversight\nresponsibility for\ncredit risk. Credit\nRisk reports to the\nChief Risk Officer\n(CRO) and also provides\nperiodic reports\nrelated to credit risk\nto the Board\u2019s Credit\nCommittee. Coronavirus\nAid, Relief, and\nEconomic Security Act\nOn March 25, 2020, the\nU.S. Senate approved\nthe Coronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic\nSecurity Act (the CARES\nAct), a bill designed\nto provide a wide range\nof economic relief to\nconsumers and\nbusinesses in the U.S.\nPAYCHECK PROTECTION\nPROGRAM The CARES Act\ncreated funding for the\nSmall Business\nAdministration\u2019s (SBA)\nloan program providing\nforgiveness of up to\nthe full principal\namount of qualifying\nloans guaranteed under\na new program called\nthe Paycheck Protection\nProgram (PPP). The\nintent of the PPP is to\nprovide loans to small\nbusinesses in order to\nkeep their employees on\nthe payroll and make\ncertain other eligible\npayments. Loans granted\nunder the PPP are\nguaranteed by the SBA\nand are fully\nforgivable if used for\nqualifying expenses\nsuch as payroll,\nmortgage interest, rent\nand utilities. If the\nloans are not forgiven,\nthey must be repaid\nover a term not to\nexceed five years.\nUnder the PPP, through\nJune 30, 2020, we\nfunded $10.1 billion in\nloans to more than\n179,000 borrowers. As\nof June 30, 2020, $9.8\nbillion of principal\nremained outstanding on\nthese PPP loans. We\ndeferred $397 million\nof SBA processing fees\nthat will be recognized\nas interest income over\nthe term of the loans.\nWe have committed to\ndonating the gross\nprocessing fees\nreceived from funding\nPPP loans to non-profit\norganizations that\nsupport small\nbusinesses as the fees\nare recognized in\nearnings. We did not\ndonate any processing\nfees during second\nquarter 2020. PPP\nLIQUIDITY FACILITY The\nFRB established the\nPaycheck Protection\nProgram Liquidity\nFacility which is\nintended to provide\nliquidity to financial\ninstitutions\nparticipating in PPP\nlending. Under this\nprogram, we act as a\ncorrespondent between\nthe Federal Reserve\nBanks and community\ndevelopment financial\ninstitutions (CDFIs) to\nfacilitate cash flows\nbetween the two\nentities. We do not\nreceive any fees for\nour participation in\nthis program. SBA SIX\nMONTH PAYMENT\nASSISTANCE Under the\nCARES Act, the SBA will\nmake principal and\ninterest payments on\nbehalf of\n\ncertain borrowers for\nsix months. As of June\n30, 2020, over 20,000\nof our lending\ncustomers were eligible\nfor SBA payment\nassistance, and we had\nreceived $193 million\nin payments from the\nSBA. MAIN STREET\nLENDING PROGRAM The\nFederal Reserve Board\n(FRB) established the\nMain Street Lending\nProgram to provide\nadditional financial\nsupport for small and\nmedium sized\nbusinesses. Under the\nterms of the program,\neligible lenders will\nperform underwriting\nand originate loans to\neligible borrowers and\nsubsequently sell 95%\nof the loan to a\nspecial purpose vehicle\nestablished by the FRB.\nWe have registered as\nan eligible lender\nunder the program and\nanticipate that we will\nbegin funding customer\nloans in third quarter\n2020.

The\nmodifications must be related to the adverse\neffects of COVID-19, and certain other\ncriteria are required to be met in order to\napply the relief. In first quarter 2020, we\nelected to apply the TDR relief provided by\nthe CARES Act, which expires no later than\nDecember 31, 2020. On April 7, 2020, federal\nbanking regulators issued the Interagency\nStatement on Loan Modifications and Reporting\nfor\n\nFinancial Institutions Working with Customers\nAffected by the Coronavirus (Revised) (the\nInteragency Statement). The Interagency\nStatement provides additional TDR relief as it\nclarifies that it is not necessary to consider\nthe impact of COVID-19 on the financial\ncondition of a borrower in connection with\nshort-term (e.g., six months or less) loan\nmodifications related to COVID-19 provided the\nborrower is current at the date the\nmodification program is implemented. For\nadditional information regarding the TDR\nrelief provided by the CARES Act and the\nclarifying TDR accounting guidance from the\nInteragency Statement, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) to Financial\nStatements in this Report. The TDR relief\nprovided under the CARES Act, as well as from\nthe Interagency Statement, does not change our\nprocesses for monitoring the credit quality of\nour loan portfolios or for updating our\nmeasurement of the allowance for credit losses\nfor loans based on expected losses.\nAdditionally, our election to apply the TDR\nrelief provided by the CARES Act and the\nInteragency Statement impacts our regulatory\ncapital ratios as these loan modifications\nrelated to COVID-19 are not adjusted to a\nhigher risk-weighting normally required with\nTDR classification. COVID-Related Lending\nAccommodations During second quarter 2020, we\ncontinued to provide accommodations to our\ncustomers in response to the COVID-19\npandemic, including fee reversals for consumer\nand small business banking customers, and\npayment deferrals, fee waivers, covenant\nwaivers, and other expanded assistance for\nmortgage, credit card, automobile, small\nbusiness, personal and commercial lending\ncustomers. Foreclosure, collection and credit\nbureau reporting activities have also been\nsuspended. Additionally, we deferred rental\npayments on certain leased assets for which we\nare the lessor. Customer payment deferral\nactivities instituted in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition\nof net charge-offs, delinquencies, and\nnonaccrual status for those customers who\nwould have otherwise moved into past due or\nnonaccrual status. Table 11 and Table 11a\nsummarize the unpaid principal balance (UPB)\nof commercial and consumer loans at June 30,\n2020, that received accommodations under loan\nmodification programs established to assist\ncustomers with the economic impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic (COVID-related\nmodifications), and exclude accommodations\nmade for customers with loans that we service\nfor others. COVID-related modifications\nprimarily included payment deferrals of\nprincipal, interest or both as well as\ninterest and fee waivers. As of June 30, 2020,\nthe unpaid principal balance of loans with\nCOVID-related modifications represented 7% and\n13% of our total commercial and consumer loan\nportfolios, respectively, and included\ncustomers that continued to make payments\nafter receiving a modification and those that\nwere no longer in a deferral period. If the\nCOVID-19 pandemic continues to cause economic\nuncertainty, customers may request additional\nor extended accommodations. During second\nquarter 2020, we provided certain extensions\nof prior modifications for up to an additional\n90 days. As of June 30, 2020, the unpaid\nprincipal balance of commercial and consumer\nloans that received extensions of prior\nmodifications was $9.7 billion and $876\nmillion, respectively. Of the loans that\nreceived COVID-related modifications, $38\nbillion and $50 billion of unpaid principal\nbalance of commercial and consumer loans,\nrespectively, were not classified as TDRs as\nof June 30, 2020, of which 5% for both\ncommercial and consumer loans qualified for\nTDR designation relief under the CARES Act or\nInteragency Statement. Additionally, the\ntables\n\n25 include $241 million and $3 billion of\nunpaid principal balance of commercial and\nconsumer loans, respectively, that were\nalready classified as TDRs when the COVID-\nrelated modification was granted. For\ninformation related to loans that are\nclassified as TDRs, see Note 6 (Loans and\nAllowance for Credit Losses) to Financial\nStatements this Report.\n\nTable 11: Commercial Loan

Our credit risk monitoring\nprocess is designed to enable early\nidentification of developing risk and to\nsupport our determination of an appropriate\nallowance for credit losses. The following\ndiscussion provides additional characteristics\nand analysis of our significant loan\nportfolios. See Note 6 (Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit Losses) to Financial\nStatements in this Report for more analysis\nand credit metric information for each of the\nfollowing portfolios. COMMERCIAL AND\nINDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING For\npurposes of portfolio risk management, we\naggregate commercial and industrial loans and\nlease financing according to market\nsegmentation and standard industry codes. We\ngenerally subject commercial and industrial\nloans and lease financing to individual risk\nassessment using our internal borrower and\ncollateral quality ratings. Our ratings are\naligned to federal banking regulators\u2019\ndefinitions of pass and criticized categories\nwith the criticized category including special\nmention, substandard, doubtful, and loss\ncategories. The commercial and industrial\nloans and lease financing portfolio totaled\n$367.5 billion , or 39% of total loans, at\nJune 30, 2020 . The net charge-off rate\n(annualized) of average loans for this\nportfolio was 0.54% and 0.45% in the second\nquarter and first 26 Risk Management - Credit\nRisk Management (continued) half of 2020 ,\nrespectively, compared with 0.18% and 0.17%\nfor the same periods a year ago. At June 30,\n2020 , 0.83% of this portfolio was\nnonaccruing, compared with 0.44% at December\n31, 2019 . Nonaccrual loans in this portfolio\nincreased $1.4 billion from December 31, 2019\n, primarily in the oil, gas and pipelines\ncategory due to the economic impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Also, $27.8 billion of the\ncommercial and industrial loan and lease\nfinancing portfolio was internally classified\nas criticized in accordance with regulatory\nguidance at June 30, 2020 , compared with\n$16.6 billion at December 31, 2019 ,\nreflecting increases primarily in the oil, gas\nand pipelines, real estate and construction,\nentertainment and recreation, and retail\ncategories due to the economic impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. The majority of our\ncommercial and industrial loans and lease\nfinancing portfolio is secured by short-term\nassets, such as accounts receivable,\ninventory, and debt securities, as well as\nlong-lived assets, such as equipment and other\nbusiness assets. Generally, the collateral\nsecuring this portfolio represents a secondary\nsource of repayment. Table 12 provides our\ncommercial and industrial loans and lease\nfinancing by industry, and includes non-U.S.\nloans of $68.2 billion and $71.7 billion at\nJune 30, 2020 , and December 31, 2019 ,\nrespectively. Significant industry\nconcentrations of non-U.S. loans included\n$32.7 billion and $31.2 billion in the\nfinancials except banks category, and $15.5\nbillion and $19.9 billion in the banks\ncategory, at June 30, 2020 , and December 31,\n2019 , respectively. The oil, gas and\npipelines category included $1.6 billion of\nnon-U.S. loans at both June 30, 2020 , and\nDecember 31, 2019 . The industry categories\nare based on the North American Industry\nClassification System. Loans to financials\nexcept banks, our largest industry\nconcentration, were $112.1 billion , or 12% of\ntotal outstanding loans, at June 30, 2020 ,\ncompared with $117.3 billion , or 12% of total\noutstanding loans, at December 31, 2019 . This\nindustry category is comprised of loans to\ninvestment firms, financial vehicles, and non-\nbank creditors, including those that invest in\nfinancial assets backed predominantly by\ncommercial or residential real estate or\nconsumer loan assets. We had $72.4 billion and\n$75.2 billion of loans originated by our Asset\nBacked Finance (ABF) lines of business at June\n30, 2020 , and December 31, 2019 ,\nrespectively. These ABF loans are limited to a\npercentage of the value of the underlying\nfinancial assets considering underlying credit\nrisk, asset duration, and ongoing performance.\nThese ABF loans may also have other features\nto manage credit risk such as cross-\ncollateralization, credit enhancements, and\ncontractual re-margining of collateral\nsupporting the loans. Loans to financials\nexcept banks included collateralized loan\nobligations (CLOs) in loan form of $7.7\nbillion and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2020, and\nDecember 31, 2019, respectively. Oil, gas and\npipelines loans totaled $12.6 billion , or 1%\nof total outstanding loans, at June 30, 2020 ,\ncompared with $13.6 billion , or 1% of total\noutstanding loans, at December 31, 2019 . Oil,\ngas and pipelines loans included $8.9 billion\nand $9.2 billion of senior secured loans\noutstanding at June 30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019 , respectively. Oil, gas and pipelines\nnonaccrual loans increased to $1.4 billion at\nJune 30, 2020 , compared with $615 million at\nDecember 31, 2019 , due to new downgrades to\nnonaccrual status in second quarter 2020. In\naddition to the oil, gas and pipelines\ncategory, industries with escalated credit\nmonitoring include retail, entertainment and\nrecreation, transportation services, and\ncommercial real estate.

By property type, the\nlargest concentrations are office buildings at\n26% and apartments at 19% of the portfolio.\nCRE nonaccrual loans totaled 0.86% of the CRE\noutstanding balance at June 30, 2020 ,\ncompared with 0.43% at December 31, 2019 . The\nincrease in CRE nonaccrual loans was driven by\nthe hotel/motel, shopping center, and office\nbuildings property types and reflected the\neconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. At\nJune 30, 2020 , we had $9.1 billion of\ncriticized CRE mortgage loans, compared with\n$3.8 billion at December 31, 2019 , and $1.3\nbillion of criticized CRE construction loans,\ncompared with $187 million at December 31,\n2019 . The increase in criticized CRE mortgage\nand CRE construction loans was driven by the\nhotel/motel, shopping center, retail\n(excluding shopping center), and office\nbuilding property types and reflected the\neconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTable 13: CRE Loans by State and Property Type\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                \u2026                        %    \n                \u2026                        \u2026    \n                \u2026                        \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026             \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026             \n                                              \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        4    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        2    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        1    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        *    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        *    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        *    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        *    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        *    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        *    \n         \u2026               4      \u2026        *    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        5    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        \u2026    \n                                              \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        4    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        3    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        2    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        2    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        1    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        1    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        *    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        *    \n         \u2026               \u2014      \u2026        *    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        *    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        *    \n         \u2026               \u2026      \u2026        \u2026    \n                                              \n                    \n  *  Less than 1%.  \n                    \n(1) Consists of 40\nstates, none of which\nhad loans in excess of\n$3.7 billion . 28 Risk\nManagement - Credit\nRisk Management\n(continued)\n\nNON-U.S LOANS Our\nclassification of\nnon-U.S. loans is based\non whether the\nborrower\u2019s primary\naddress is outside of\nthe United States.

We\nestablish exposure\nlimits for each country\nthrough a centralized\noversight process based\non customer needs, and\nthrough consideration\nof the relevant and\ndistinct risk of each\ncountry. We monitor\nexposures closely and\nadjust our country\nlimits in response to\nchanging conditions.

Our largest\nsingle country exposure\noutside the U.S. based\non our assessment of\nrisk at June 30, 2020 ,\nwas the United Kingdom\n, which totaled $36.3\nbillion , or\napproximately 2% of our\ntotal assets, and\nincluded $11.6 billion\nof sovereign claims.\nOur United Kingdom\nsovereign claims arise\npredominantly from\ndeposits we have placed\nwith the Bank of\nEngland pursuant to\nregulatory requirements\nin support of our\nLondon branch.

As the\nUnited Kingdom exits\nfrom the European\nUnion, our primary goal\nis to continue to serve\nour existing clients in\nthe United Kingdom and\nthe European Union as\nwell as to continue to\nmeet the needs of our\ndomestic clients as\nthey do business in\nthose locations.

For more\ninformation on PCD\nloans, see Note 1\n(Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) to\nFinancial Statements in\nthis Report. We\ncontinue to modify real\nestate 1-4 family\nmortgage loans to\nassist homeowners and\nother borrowers\nexperiencing financial\ndifficulties. For more\ninformation on our\nmodification programs,\nsee the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Credit\nRisk Management \u2013 Real\nEstate 1-4 Family\nMortgage Loans\u201d section\nin our 2019 Form 10-K.\nFor more information on\ncustomer\naccommodations,\nincluding loan\nmodifications, in\nresponse to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, see\nthe \u201cRisk Management \u2013\nCredit Risk Management\n\u2013 COVID-Related Lending\nAccommodations\u201d section\nin this Report.

In addition, in\nsecond quarter 2020 we designated $10.4\nbillion of first mortgage loans as MLHFS. Net\nloan charge-offs (annualized) as a percentage\nof average first mortgage loans were 0.00% in\nboth the second quarter and first half of 2020\n, compared with a net recovery of 0.04% and\n0.03% for the same periods a year ago.\nNonaccrual loans were $2.4 billion at June 30,\n2020 , up $243 million from December 31, 2019\n. The increase in nonaccrual loans from\nDecember 31, 2019 was driven by the\nimplementation of CECL, which required PCI\nloans to be classified as nonaccruing based on\nperformance.

For more  \n       information, see Note 1 (Summary of    \n       Significant Accounting Policies) to    \n       Financial Statements in this Report.   \n                                              \nJunior Lien Mortgage Portfolio The junior lien\nmortgage portfolio consists of residential\nmortgage lines and loans that are subordinate\nin rights to an existing lien on the same\nproperty. It is not unusual for these lines\nand loans to have draw periods, interest-only\npayments, balloon payments, adjustable rates,\nand similar features. Junior lien loan\nproducts are mostly amortizing payment loans\nwith fixed interest rates and repayment\nperiods between five to 30 years. We\ncontinuously monitor the credit performance of\nour junior lien mortgage portfolio for trends\nand factors that influence the frequency and\nseverity of loss, such as junior lien mortgage\nperformance when the first mortgage loan is\ndelinquent. Table 18 shows certain delinquency\nand loss information for the junior lien\nmortgage portfolio and lists the top five\nstates by outstanding balance. The decrease in\noutstanding balances since December 31, 2019 ,\npredominantly reflected loan paydowns. In\nsecond quarter 2020, we suspended the\norigination of junior lien mortgages. As of\nJune 30, 2020 , 4% of the outstanding balance\nof the junior lien mortgage portfolio was\nassociated with loans that had a combined loan\nto value (CLTV) ratio in excess of 100%. Of\nthose junior lien mortgages with a CLTV ratio\nin excess of 100%, 3% were 30 days or more\npast due. CLTV means the ratio of the total\nloan balance of first mortgages and junior\nlien mortgages (including unused line amounts\nfor credit line products) to property\ncollateral value. The unsecured portion (the\noutstanding amount that was in excess of the\nmost recent property collateral value) of the\noutstanding balances of these loans totaled 1%\nof the junior lien mortgage portfolio at June\n30, 2020 . For additional information on\nconsumer loans by LTV/CLTV, see Table 6.12 in\nNote 6 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit\nLosses) to Financial Statements in this\nReport.

For more  \n       information, see Note 1 (Summary of    \n       Significant Accounting Policies) to    \n       Financial Statements in this Report.   \n                                              \n31 Our junior lien, as well as first lien,\nlines of credit portfolios generally have draw\nperiods of 10, 15 or 20 years with variable\ninterest rate and payment options available\nduring the draw period of (1) interest only or\n(2) 1.5% of outstanding principal balance plus\naccrued interest. As of June 30, 2020 , lines\nof credit in a draw period primarily used the\ninterest-only option. During the draw period,\nthe borrower has the option of converting all\nor a portion of the line from a variable\ninterest rate to a fixed rate with terms\nincluding interest-only payments for a fixed\nperiod between three to seven years or a fully\namortizing payment with a fixed period between\nfive to 30 years. At the end of the draw\nperiod, a line of credit generally converts to\nan amortizing payment schedule with repayment\nterms of up to 30 years based on the balance\nat time of conversion. Certain lines and loans\nhave been structured with a balloon payment,\nwhich requires full repayment of the\noutstanding balance at the end of the term\nperiod. The conversion of lines or loans to\nfully amortizing or balloon payoff may result\nin a significant payment increase, which can\naffect some borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the\noutstanding balance. On a monthly basis, we\nmonitor the payment characteristics of\nborrowers in our first and junior lien lines\nof credit portfolios. In June 2020 , excluding\nborrowers with COVID-19 related loan\nmodification payment deferrals, approximately\n44% of borrowers paid only the minimum amount\ndue and approximately 52% paid more than the\nminimum amount due. The rest were either\ndelinquent or paid less than the minimum\namount due. For the borrowers with an\ninterest-only payment feature, approximately\n28% paid only the minimum amount due and\napproximately 68% paid more than the minimum\namount due. The lines that enter their\namortization period may experience higher\ndelinquencies and higher loss rates than the\nones in their draw or term period. We have\nconsidered this increased inherent risk in our\nallowance for credit loss estimate. In\nanticipation of our borrowers reaching the end\nof their contractual commitment, we have\ncreated a program to inform, educate and help\nthese borrowers transition from interest-only\nto fully-amortizing payments or full\nrepayment. We monitor the performance of the\nborrowers moving through the program in an\neffort to refine our ongoing program strategy.\nTable 19 reflects the outstanding balance of\nour portfolio of junior lien mortgages,\nincluding lines and loans, and first lien\nlines segregated into scheduled end-of-draw or\nend-of-term periods and products that are\ncurrently amortizing, or in balloon repayment\nstatus.

The decrease in the net\ncharge-off rate in second quarter 2020,\ncompared with the same period a year ago, was\ndriven by payment deferral activities in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic. AUTOMOBILE\nOur automobile portfolio totaled $48.8 billion\nat June 30, 2020 . The net charge-off rate\n(annualized) for our automobile portfolio was\n0.88% for second quarter 2020 , compared with\n0.46% for second quarter 2019 , and 0.78% and\n0.64% for the first half of 2020 and 2019 ,\nrespectively. The increase in the net charge-\noff rate in the second quarter and first half\nof 2020 , compared with the same periods in\n2019 , was driven by lower recoveries due to\nthe temporary suspension of involuntary\nrepossessions in response to the COVID-19\npandemic. OTHER REVOLVING CREDIT AND\nINSTALLMENT Other revolving credit and\ninstallment loans totaled $32.4 billion at\nJune 30, 2020 , and largely included student\nand securities-based loans. Our private\nstudent loan portfolio totaled $10.3 billion\nat June 30, 2020 . On July 1, 2020, we\nannounced that only customers with an\noutstanding private student loan balance will\nbe eligible for new loans for the upcoming\nacademic year. The net charge-off rate\n(annualized) for other revolving credit and\ninstallment loans was 1.09% for second quarter\n2020 , compared with 1.56% for second quarter\n2019 , and 1.35% and 1.52% for the first half\nof 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The decrease\nin the net charge-off rate in the second\nquarter and first half of 2020, compared with\nthe same periods a year ago, was driven by\npayment deferral activities in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. 32 Risk Management - Credit\nRisk Management (continued) NONPERFORMING\nASSETS (NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED\nASSETS) Table 20 summarizes nonperforming\nassets (NPAs) for each of the last four\nquarters. Total NPAs increased $1.4 billion\nfrom first quarter 2020 to $7.8 billion .\nNonaccrual loans of $7.6 billion increased\n$1.4 billion from first quarter 2020. The\nincrease in nonaccrual loans was driven by an\nincrease in commercial nonaccrual loans\npredominantly due to an increase in oil and\ngas and real estate mortgage nonaccrual loans\nas the economic impact of the COVID-19\npandemic continued to impact our customer\nbase. Customer payment deferral activities\ninstituted in response to the COVID-19\npandemic may delay recognition of\ndelinquencies for customers who otherwise\nwould have moved into nonaccrual status. Prior\nto January 1, 2020, PCI loans were excluded\nfrom nonaccrual loans because they continued\nto earn interest income from accretable yield,\nindependent of performance in accordance with\ntheir contractual terms. However, as a result\nof our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020,\n$275 million of real estate 1-4 family\nmortgage loans were reclassified from PCI to\nPCD loans, and as a result, were also\nclassified as nonaccrual loans given their\ncontractual delinquency. For more information\non PCD loans, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) to Financial\nStatements in this Report. For information\nabout when we generally place loans on\nnonaccrual status, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) to Financial\nStatements in our 2019 Form 10-K.

See\nNote 6 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit\nLosses) to Financial Statements in this Report\nfor additional information regarding TDRs. In\nthose situations where principal is forgiven,\nthe entire amount of such forgiveness is\nimmediately charged off. When we delay the\ntiming on the repayment of a portion of\nprincipal (principal forbearance), we charge\noff the amount of forbearance if that amount\nis not considered fully collectible. As part\nof our actions to support customers during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, we have provided borrowers\nrelief in the form of loan modifications.\nUnder the CARES Act and the Interagency\nStatement, loan modifications related to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic will not be classified as\nTDRs if they meet certain eligibility\ncriteria.

Prior\nto January 1, 2020, PCI loans were excluded\nfrom loans 90 days or more past due and still\naccruing because they continued to earn\ninterest income from accretable yield,\nindependent of performance in accordance with\ntheir contractual terms. In connection with\nour adoption of CECL, PCI loans were\nreclassified as PCD loans and classified as\naccruing or nonaccruing based on performance.\nLoans 90 days or more past due and still\naccruing, excluding insured/guaranteed loans,\nat June 30, 2020 , were down $116 million , or\n12% , from December 31, 2019 due to payoffs\nand lower delinquencies in consumer loans as\npayment deferral activities instituted in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic delayed\nrecognition of delinquencies for customers who\nwould have otherwise moved into past due\nstatus, partially offset by an increase in\ncommercial loans 90 days or more past due and\nstill accruing driven by credit deterioration\ndue to the economic impact of the COVID-19\npandemic. Loans 90 days or more past due and\nstill accruing whose repayments are\npredominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed\nby the VA for mortgages were $8.9 billion at\nJune 30, 2020 , up from $6.4 billion at\nDecember 31, 2019 , due to the economic\nslowdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic\naffecting our customers.

Net loan charge-offs in second\nquarter 2020 were $1.1 billion ( 0.46% of\naverage total loans outstanding), compared\nwith $653 million ( 0.28% ) in second quarter\n2019 . The increase in commercial net loan\ncharge-offs in second quarter 2020 from the\nprior quarter was driven by higher commercial\nand industrial losses primarily in our oil and\ngas portfolio, as well as higher commercial\nreal estate mortgage losses. The decrease in\nconsumer net loan charge-offs in second\nquarter 2020 from the prior quarter was driven\nby lower losses in credit card, and other\nrevolving credit and installment loans driven\nby payment deferral activities in response to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic\nmay continue to impact the credit quality of\nour loan portfolio. Although the potential\nimpacts were considered in our allowance for\ncredit losses for loans, payment deferral\nactivities instituted in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition\nof net loan charge-offs. For more information\non customer accommodations in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, see the \u201cRisk Management \u2013\nCredit Risk Management \u2013 COVID-Related Lending\nAccommodations\u201d section in this Report.\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES We maintain an\nallowance for credit losses for loans, which\nis management\u2019s estimate of the expected\ncredit losses in the loan portfolio and\nunfunded credit commitments, at the balance\nsheet date, excluding loans and unfunded\ncredit commitments carried at fair value or\nheld for sale. Additionally, we maintain an\nallowance for credit losses for debt\nsecurities classified as either available-for-\nsale or held-to-maturity, other financial\nassets measured at amortized cost, net\ninvestments in leases, and other off-balance\nsheet credit exposures. We apply a disciplined\nprocess and methodology to establish our\nallowance for credit losses each quarter. The\nprocess for establishing the allowance for\ncredit losses for loans takes into\nconsideration many factors, including\nhistorical and forecasted loss trends, loan-\nlevel credit quality ratings and loan grade-\nspecific characteristics. The process involves\nsubjective and complex judgments. In addition,\nwe review a variety of credit metrics and\ntrends. These credit metrics and trends,\nhowever, do not solely determine the amount of\nthe allowance as we use several analytical\ntools. For additional information on our\nallowance for credit losses, see the \u201cCritical\nAccounting Policies \u2013 Allowance for Credit\nLosses\u201d section and Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) to Financial\nStatements in this Report. For additional\ninformation on our allowance for credit losses\nfor loans, see Note 6 (Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit Losses) to Financial\nStatements in this Report, and for additional\ninformation on our allowance for credit losses\nfor debt securities, see the \u201cBalance Sheet\nAnalysis \u2013 Available-For-Sale and Held-To-\nMaturity Debt Securities\u201d section and Note 5\n(Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt\nSecurities) to Financial Statements in this\nReport.

The\nscenarios include a\nbase case considered to\nbe the most likely\neconomic forecast,\nalong with an\noptimistic (upside) and\na pessimistic\n(downside) economic\nforecast. Our estimate\nof the allowance for\ncredit losses for loans\nat June 30, 2020, was\nbased on a weighting of\nthe base case and\ndownside economic\nscenarios of 80% and\n20%, respectively, with\nno weighting applied to\nthe upside scenario.\nThe base case economic\nforecast assumed near-\nterm economic stress\nrecovering into late\n2021. The downside\nscenario assumed more\nsustained adverse\neconomic impacts\nresulting from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\ncompared with the base\ncase. The downside\nscenario assumed U.S.\nreal GDP increasing\nslowly and not fully\nrecovering during the\nremainder of 2020 and\n2021, and a sustained\nelevation in the U.S.\nunemployment rate until\nmid-2022. We considered\nexpectations for the\nimpact of government\neconomic stimulus\nprograms in effect on\nJune 30, 2020; however,\nwe did not consider the\nimpact of future\ngovernment economic\nstimulus programs. In\naddition, we considered\nexpectations for the\nimpact of customer\naccommodation activity,\nas well as the\nestimated impact on\ncertain industries that\nwe consider to be\ndirectly and most\nadversely affected by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition to\nquantitative estimates,\nwe consider qualitative\nfactors that represent\nrisks inherent in our\nprocesses and\nassumptions such as\neconomic environmental\nfactors, modeling 40\nRisk Management -\nCredit Risk Management\n(continued)\n\nassumptions and\nperformance, and other\nsubjective factors,\nincluding industry\ntrends and emerging\nrisk assessments. At\nJune 30, 2020, the\nqualitative portion of\nour allowance for\ncredit losses for loans\nincluded adjustments\nfor model performance\nrelative to\nmanagement's loss\nexpectations, including\nspecific incremental\nrisks from the oil and\ngas, commercial real\nestate, and home\nlending portfolios due\nto the continued\neconomic impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. The\nforecasted key economic\nvariables inherent in\nour estimate of the\nallowance for credit\nlosses for loans at\nJune 30, 2020 , are\npresented in Table 28 .\nTable 28: Forecasted\nKey Economic Variables\n                                              \n             4Q           2Q           4Q     \n           2020         2021         2021     \n  Blend                                       \n  of                                          \n  80%                                         \n  base                                        \n  case                                        \n  and                                         \n  20%                                         \n  down\u2026                                       \n  scen\u2026                                       \n  (1):                                        \n  U.S.                                        \n  unem\u2026    11.0          9.2          7.5     \n  rate                                        \n  (2)                                         \n  U.S.                                        \n  real      4.3          6.3          3.5     \n  GDP                                         \n  (3)                                         \n  Home                                        \n  price     0.7         (3.0  )      (0.9  )  \n  index                                       \n  (4)                                         \n  Comm\u2026                                       \n  real                                        \n  esta\u2026    (2.5  )      (7.6  )      (5.1  )  \n  asset                                       \n  pric\u2026                                       \n  (4)                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  (1)  Represents a weighted average of the   \n       forecasted economic variable inputs.   \n                                              \n                           \n  (2)  Quarterly average.  \n                           \n                                             \n  (3)  Seasonally adjusted annualized rate.  \n                                             \n                                              \n       Percentage change year over year of    \n  (4)  national average; outlook differs by   \n       geography and property type.           \n                                              \nFuture amounts of the\nallowance for credit\nlosses for loans will\nbe based on a variety\nof factors, including\nloan balance changes,\nportfolio credit\nquality and mix\nchanges, and changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions and\nexpectations (including\nfor unemployment and\nGDP), among other\nfactors. Based on\neconomic conditions at\nthe end of second\nquarter 2020, it was\ndifficult to estimate\nthe length and severity\nof the economic\ndownturn that may\nresult from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and\nthe impact of other\nfactors that may\ninfluence the level of\neventual losses and\ncorresponding\nrequirements for future\namounts of the\nallowance for credit\nlosses, including the\nimpact of economic\nstimulus programs and\ncustomer accommodation\nactivity. The COVID-19\npandemic could continue\nto result in the\nrecognition of credit\nlosses in our loan\nportfolios and\nincreases in our\nallowance for credit\nlosses, particularly if\nthe impact on the\neconomy worsens. We\nbelieve the allowance\nfor credit losses for\nloans of $20.4 billion\nat June 30, 2020 , was\nappropriate to cover\nexpected credit losses,\nincluding unfunded\ncredit commitments, at\nthat date. The entire\nallowance is available\nto absorb expected\ncredit losses from the\ntotal loan portfolio.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses for loans\nis subject to change\nand reflects existing\nfactors as of the date\nof determination,\nincluding economic or\nmarket conditions and\nongoing internal and\nexternal examination\nprocesses. Due to the\nsensitivity of the\nallowance for credit\nlosses for loans to\nchanges in the economic\nand business\nenvironment, it is\npossible that we will\nincur incremental\ncredit losses not\nanticipated as of the\nbalance sheet date.\nLIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE\nLOAN REPURCHASE LOSSES\nFor information on our\nrepurchase liability,\nsee the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Credit\nRisk Management \u2013\nLiability For Mortgage\nLoan Repurchase Losses\u201d\nsection in our 2019\nForm 10-K. RISKS\nRELATING TO SERVICING\nACTIVITIES In addition\nto servicing loans in\nour portfolio, we act\nas servicer and/or\nmaster servicer of\nresidential mortgage\nloans included in GSE-\nguaranteed mortgage\nsecuritizations, GNMA-\nguaranteed mortgage\nsecuritizations of FHA-\ninsured/VA-guaranteed\nmortgages and private\nlabel\n\nmortgage\nsecuritizations, as\nwell as for\nunsecuritized loans\nowned by institutional\ninvestors. In\nconnection with our\nservicing activities,\nwe could become subject\nto consent orders and\nsettlement agreements\nwith federal and state\nregulators for alleged\nservicing issues and\npractices. In general,\nthese can require us to\nprovide customers with\nloan modification\nrelief, refinancing\nrelief, and foreclosure\nprevention and\nassistance, as well as\ncan impose certain\nmonetary penalties on\nus. As a servicer, we\nare required to advance\ncertain delinquent\npayments of principal\nand interest on the\nmortgage loans we\nservice. The amount and\ntiming of reimbursement\nof these advances vary\nby investor and the\napplicable servicing\nagreements in place.\nDue to an increase in\ncustomer requests for\npayment deferrals as a\nresult of the COVID-19\npandemic, the amount of\nprincipal and interest\nadvances we were\nrequired to make as a\nservicer increased in\nsecond quarter 2020 .\nThe amount of these\nadvances may continue\nto increase if\nadditional payment\ndeferrals are provided.\nPayment deferrals also\ndelay the collection of\ncontractually specified\nservicing fees,\nresulting in lower net\nservicing income. In\naccordance with\napplicable servicing\nguidelines, delinquency\nstatus continues to\nadvance for loans with\nCOVID-related payment\ndeferrals, which has\nresulted in an increase\nin delinquent loans\nserviced for others and\na corresponding\nincrease in loans\neligible for repurchase\nfrom GNMA loan\nsecuritization pools.\nOur option to\nrepurchase loans from\nGNMA loan\nsecuritization pools\nbecomes exercisable\nwhen three scheduled\nloan payments remain\nunpaid by the borrower.\nWe generally repurchase\nthese loans for cash\nand as a result, our\ntotal consolidated\nassets do not change.\nIn July 2020, we\nrepurchased $14.1\nbillion of these\ndelinquent loans and we\nexpect to repurchase\n$5.6 billion of these\ndelinquent loans in\nAugust 2020. Loans that\nregain current status\nor are otherwise\nmodified in accordance\nwith applicable\nservicing guidelines\nmay be included in\nfuture GNMA loan\nsecuritization pools.\nHowever, in accordance\nwith guidance issued by\nGNMA in June 2020,\nrepurchased loans with\nCOVID-related payment\ndeferrals are\nineligible for\ninclusion in future\nGNMA loan\nsecuritization pools\nuntil the borrower has\ntimely made six\nconsecutive payments.\nThis requirement may\ndelay our ability to\nresell loans into the\nsecuritization market.\nFor additional\ninformation about the\nrisks related to our\nservicing activities,\nsee the \u201cRisk\nManagement \u2013 Credit\nRisk Management \u2013 Risks\nRelating to Servicing\nActivities\u201d section in\nour 2019 Form 10-K. For\nadditional information\non mortgage banking\nactivities, see Note 11\n(Mortgage Banking\nActivities) to\nFinancial Statements in\nthis Report.\nAsset/Liability\nManagement\nAsset/liability\nmanagement involves\nevaluating, monitoring\nand managing interest\nrate risk, market risk,\nliquidity and funding.\nPrimary oversight of\ninterest rate risk and\nmarket risk resides\nwith the Finance\nCommittee of our Board,\nwhich oversees the\nadministration and\neffectiveness of\nfinancial risk\nmanagement policies and\nprocesses used to\nassess and manage these\nrisks. Primary\noversight of liquidity\nand funding resides\nwith the Risk Committee\nof the Board. At the\nmanagement level we\nutilize a Corporate\nAsset/Liability\nCommittee (Corporate\nALCO), which consists\nof management from\nfinance, risk and\nbusiness groups, to\noversee these risks and\nprovide periodic\nreports to the Board\u2019s\nFinance Committee and\nRisk Committee as\nappropriate. As\ndiscussed in more\ndetail for market risk\nactivities below, we\nemploy separate\nmanagement level\noversight specific to\nmarket risk.\n\n41\n\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nInterest rate risk,\nwhich potentially can\nhave a significant\nearnings impact, is an\nintegral part of being\na financial\nintermediary. We are\nsubject to interest\nrate risk because:\n                                              \n     assets and liabilities may mature or     \n     reprice at different times (for          \n  \u2022  example, if assets reprice faster than   \n     liabilities and interest rates are       \n     generally rising, earnings will          \n     initially increase);                     \n                                              \n                                              \n     assets and liabilities may reprice at    \n     the same time but by different amounts   \n     (for example, when the general level of  \n  \u2022  interest rates is rising, we may         \n     increase rates paid on checking and      \n     savings deposit accounts by an amount    \n     that is less than the general rise in    \n     market interest rates);                  \n                                              \n                                              \n     short-term and long-term market          \n     interest rates may change by different   \n  \u2022  amounts (for example, the shape of the   \n     yield curve may affect new loan yields   \n     and funding costs differently);          \n                                              \n                                              \n     the remaining maturity of various        \n     assets or liabilities may shorten or     \n     lengthen as interest rates change (for   \n  \u2022  example, if long-term mortgage interest  \n     rates increase sharply, MBS held in the  \n     debt securities portfolio may pay down   \n     slower than anticipated, which could     \n     impact portfolio income); or             \n                                              \n                                              \n     interest rates may also have a direct    \n     or indirect effect on loan demand,       \n     collateral values, credit losses,        \n  \u2022  mortgage origination volume, the fair    \n     value of MSRs and other financial        \n     instruments, the value of the pension    \n     liability and other items affecting      \n     earnings.                                \n                                              \nWe assess interest rate\nrisk by comparing\noutcomes under various\nnet interest income\nsimulations using many\ninterest rate scenarios\nthat differ in the\ndirection of interest\nrate changes, the\ndegree of change over\ntime, the speed of\nchange and the\nprojected shape of the\nyield curve. These\nsimulations require\nassumptions regarding\ndrivers of earnings and\nbalance sheet\ncomposition such as\nloan originations,\nprepayment speeds on\nloans and debt\nsecurities, deposit\nflows and mix, as well\nas pricing strategies.\nCurrently, our profile\nis such that we project\nnet interest income\nwill benefit from\nhigher interest rates\nas our assets would\nreprice faster and to a\ngreater degree than our\nliabilities, while in\nthe case of lower\ninterest rates, our\nassets would reprice\ndownward and to a\ngreater degree than our\nliabilities.

Our\ninterest rate sensitive\nnoninterest income and\nexpense are\npredominantly driven by\nmortgage banking\nactivities, and may\nmove in the opposite\ndirection of our net\ninterest income.\nMortgage originations\ngenerally decline in\nresponse to higher\ninterest rates and\ngenerally increase,\nparticularly\nrefinancing activity,\nin response to lower\ninterest rates.\nMortgage results are\nalso impacted by the\nvaluation of MSRs and\nrelated hedge\npositions. See the\n\u201cRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability\nManagement \u2013 Mortgage\nBanking Interest Rate\nand Market Risk\u201d\nsection in this Report\nfor more information.\nInterest rate sensitive\nnoninterest income also\nresults from changes in\nearnings credit for\nnoninterest-bearing\ndeposits that reduce\ntreasury management\ndeposit service fees.\nAdditionally, for the\ntrading portfolio, our\ntrading assets are\n(before the effects of\ncertain economic\nhedges) generally less\nsensitive to changes in\ninterest rates than the\nrelated funding\nliabilities. As a\nresult, net interest\nincome from the trading\nportfolio contracts and\nexpands as interest\nrates rise and fall,\nrespectively. The\nimpact to net interest\nincome does not include\nthe fair value changes\nof trading securities\nand loans, which, along\nwith the effects of\nrelated economic\nhedges, are recorded in\nnoninterest income. We\nuse the debt securities\nportfolio and exchange-\ntraded and over-the-\ncounter (OTC) interest\nrate derivatives to\nhedge our interest rate\nexposures. See the\n\u201cBalance Sheet Analysis\n\u2013 Available-for-Sale\nand Held-to-Maturity\nDebt Securities\u201d\nsection in this Report\nfor more information on\nthe use of the\navailable-for-sale and\nheld-to-maturity\nsecurities portfolios.\nThe notional or\ncontractual amount,\ncredit risk amount and\nfair value of the\nderivatives used to\nhedge our interest rate\nrisk exposures as of\nJune 30, 2020 , and\nDecember 31, 2019 , are\npresented in Note 15\n(Derivatives) to\nFinancial Statements in\nthis Report.

For\nmore information on mortgage banking interest\nrate and market risk, see the \u201cRisk Management\n\u2013 Asset/Liability Management \u2013 Mortgage\nBanking Interest Rate and Market Risk\u201d section\nin our 2019 Form 10-K. While our hedging\nactivities are designed to balance our\nmortgage banking interest rate risks, the\nfinancial instruments we use may not perfectly\ncorrelate with the values and income being\nhedged. For example, the change in the value\nof ARM production held for sale from changes\nin mortgage interest rates may or may not be\nfully offset by index-based financial\ninstruments used as economic hedges for such\nARMs. Hedge results may also be impacted as\nthe overall level of hedges changes as\ninterest rates change, or as there are other\nchanges in the market for mortgage forwards\nthat may affect the implied carry on the MSRs.\nThe total carrying value of our residential\nand commercial MSRs was $ 8.2 billion at June\n30, 2020 , and $ 12.9 billion at December 31,\n2019 . The weighted-average note rate on our\nportfolio of loans serviced for others was\n4.13% at June 30, 2020 , and 4.25% at December\n31, 2019 . The carrying value of our total\nMSRs represented 0.52% and 0.79% of mortgage\nloans serviced for others at June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 , respectively. MARKET RISK\nMarket risk is the risk of possible economic\nloss from adverse changes in market risk\nfactors such as interest rates, credit\nspreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and\ncommodity prices, and the risk of possible\nloss due to counterparty exposure. This\napplies to implied volatility risk, basis\nrisk, and market liquidity risk. It also\nincludes price risk in the trading book,\nmortgage servicing rights and the hedge\neffectiveness risk associated with the\nmortgage book, and impairment on private\nequity investments. The Board\u2019s Finance\nCommittee has primary oversight responsibility\nfor market risk and oversees the Company\u2019s\nmarket risk exposure and market risk\nmanagement strategies. In addition, the\nBoard\u2019s Risk Committee has certain oversight\nresponsibilities with respect to market risk,\nincluding adjusting the Company\u2019s market risk\nappetite with input from the Finance\nCommittee. The Finance Committee also reports\nkey market risk matters to the Risk Committee.\nAt the management level, the Market and\nCounterparty Risk Management function, which\nis part of IRM, has primary oversight\nresponsibility for market risk. The Market and\nCounterparty Risk Management function reports\ninto the CRO and also provides periodic\nreports related to market risk to the Board\u2019s\nFinance Committee.\n\nMARKET RISK \u2013 TRADING ACTIVITIES We engage in\ntrading activities to accommodate the\ninvestment and risk management activities of\nour customers and to execute economic hedging\nto manage certain balance sheet risks. These\ntrading activities predominantly occur within\nour Wholesale Banking businesses and to a\nlesser extent other divisions of the Company.\nDebt securities held for trading, equity\nsecurities held for trading, trading loans and\ntrading derivatives are financial instruments\nused in our trading activities, and all are\ncarried at fair value. Income earned on the\nfinancial instruments used in our trading\nactivities include net interest income,\nchanges in fair value and realized gains and\nlosses. Net interest income earned from our\ntrading activities is reflected in the\ninterest income and interest expense\ncomponents of our income statement. Changes in\nfair value of the financial instruments used\nin our trading activities are reflected in net\ngains on trading activities, a component of\nnoninterest income in our income statement.\nFor more information on the financial\ninstruments used in our trading activities and\nthe income from these trading activities, see\nNote 4 (Trading Activities) to Financial\nStatements in this Report. Value-at-risk (VaR)\nis a statistical risk measure used to estimate\nthe potential loss from adverse moves in the\nfinancial markets. The Company uses VaR\nmetrics complemented with sensitivity analysis\nand stress testing in measuring and monitoring\nmarket risk. For more information, including\ninformation regarding our monitoring\nactivities, sensitivity analysis and stress\ntesting, see the \u201cRisk Management \u2013\nAsset/Liability Management \u2013 Market Risk \u2013\nTrading Activities\u201d section in our 2019 Form\n10-K. Trading VaR is the measure used to\nprovide insight into the market risk exhibited\nby the Company\u2019s trading positions. The\nCompany calculates Trading VaR for risk\nmanagement purposes to establish line of\nbusiness and Company-wide risk limits. Trading\nVaR is calculated based on all trading\npositions on our balance sheet. Table 30 shows\nthe Company\u2019s Trading General VaR by risk\ncategory. As presented in Table 30 , average\nCompany Trading General VaR was $155 million\nfor the quarter ended June 30, 2020 , compared\nwith $33 million for the quarter ended March\n31, 2020 , and $20 million for the quarter\nended June 30, 2019 . The increase in average\nas well as period end Company Trading General\nVaR for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 ,\ncompared with the quarter ended June 30, 2019\n, was driven by recent market volatility, in\nparticular changes in interest rate curves and\na significant widening of credit spreads\nentering the 12-month historical lookback\nwindow used to calculate VaR.\n\n43 Table 30: Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by\nRisk Category\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       The period-end VaR was less than the   \n       sum of the VaR components described    \n       above, which is due to portfolio       \n       diversification. The diversification   \n       effect arises because the risks are    \n       not perfectly correlated causing a     \n  (1)  portfolio of positions to usually be   \n       less risky than the sum of the risks   \n       of the positions alone.

The Board\u2019s\npolicy is to review\nbusiness developments,\nkey risks and\nhistorical returns for\nthe private equity\ninvestment portfolio at\nleast annually.\nManagement reviews\nthese investments at\nleast quarterly and\nassesses them for\npossible other-than-\ntemporary impairment\n(OTTI) and observable\nprice changes. For\nnonmarketable equity\nsecurities, the\nanalysis is based on\nfacts and circumstances\nof each individual\ninvestment and the\nexpectations for that\ninvestment\u2019s cash\nflows, capital needs,\nthe viability of its\nbusiness model, our\nexit strategy, and\nobservable price\nchanges that are\nsimilar to the\ninvestments held.\nInvestments in\nnonmarketable equity\nsecurities include\nprivate equity\ninvestments accounted\nfor under the equity\nmethod, fair value\nthrough net income, and\nthe measurement\nalternative. In\nconjunction with the\nMarch 2008 initial\npublic offering (IPO)\nof Visa, Inc. (Visa),\nwe received\napproximately 20.7\nmillion shares of Visa\nClass B common stock,\nthe class which was\napportioned to member\nbanks of Visa at the\ntime of the IPO. To\nmanage our exposure to\nVisa and realize the\nvalue of the\nappreciated Visa\nshares, we\nincrementally sold\nthese shares through a\nseries of sales,\nthereby eliminating\nthis position as of\nSeptember 30, 2015. As\npart of these sales, we\nagreed to compensate\nthe buyer for any\nadditional\ncontributions to a\nlitigation settlement\nfund for the litigation\nmatters associated with\nthe Class B shares we\nsold. Our exposure to\nthis retained\nlitigation risk has\nbeen updated quarterly\nand is reflected on our\nbalance sheet. For\nadditional information\nabout the associated\nlitigation matters, see\nthe \u201cInterchange\nLitigation\u201d section in\nNote 14 (Legal Actions)\nto Financial Statements\nin this Report. As part\nof our business to\nsupport our customers,\nwe trade public\nequities, listed/OTC\nequity derivatives and\nconvertible bonds. We\nhave parameters that\ngovern these\nactivities. We also\nhave marketable equity\nsecurities that include\ninvestments relating to\nour venture capital\nactivities. We manage\nthese marketable equity\nsecurities within\ncapital risk limits\napproved by management\nand the Board and\nmonitored by Corporate\nALCO and the Market\nRisk Committee. The\nfair value changes in\nthese marketable equity\nsecurities are\nrecognized in net\nincome. For more\ninformation, see Note 8\n(Equity Securities) to\nFinancial Statements in\nthis Report. Changes in\nequity market prices\nmay also indirectly\naffect our net income\nby (1) the value of\nthird party assets\nunder management and,\nhence, fee income, (2)\nborrowers whose ability\nto repay principal\nand/or interest may be\naffected by the stock\nmarket, or (3)\nbrokerage activity,\nrelated commission\nincome and other\nbusiness activities.\nEach business line\nmonitors and manages\nthese indirect risks.\nLIQUIDITY AND FUNDING\nThe objective of\neffective liquidity\nmanagement is to ensure\nthat we can meet\ncustomer loan requests,\ncustomer deposit\nmaturities/withdrawals\nand other cash\ncommitments efficiently\nunder both normal\noperating conditions\nand under periods of\nWells Fargo-specific\nand/or market stress.\nTo achieve this\nobjective, the Board\nestablishes liquidity\nguidelines that require\nsufficient asset-based\nliquidity to cover\npotential funding\nrequirements and to\navoid over-dependence\non volatile, less\nreliable funding\nmarkets. These\nguidelines are\nmonitored on a monthly\nbasis by the Corporate\nALCO and on a quarterly\nbasis by the Board.\nThese guidelines are\nestablished and\nmonitored for both the\nconsolidated company\nand for the Parent on a\nstand-alone basis to\nensure that the Parent\nis a source of strength\nfor its regulated,\ndeposit-taking banking\nsubsidiaries. Liquidity\nStandards We are\nsubject to a rule,\nissued by the FRB, OCC\nand Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\n(FDIC), that includes a\nquantitative liquidity\nrequirement consistent\nwith the liquidity\ncoverage ratio (LCR)\nestablished by the\nBasel Committee on\nBanking Supervision\n(BCBS). The rule\nrequires banking\ninstitutions, such as\nWells Fargo, to hold\nhigh-quality liquid\nassets (HQLA), such as\ncentral bank reserves\nand government and\ncorporate debt that can\nbe converted easily and\nquickly into cash, in\nan amount equal to or\ngreater than its\nprojected net cash\noutflows during a\n30-day stress period.\nThe rule is applicable\nto the Company on a\nconsolidated basis and\nto our insured\ndepository institutions\n(IDIs) with total\nassets greater than $10\nbillion. In addition,\nrules issued by the FRB\nimpose enhanced\nliquidity management\nstandards on large BHCs\nsuch as Wells Fargo.\nThe FRB, OCC and FDIC\nhave proposed a rule\nthat would implement a\nstable funding\nrequirement, the net\nstable funding ratio\n(NSFR), which would\nrequire large banking\norganizations, such as\nWells Fargo, to\nmaintain a sufficient\namount of stable 44\nAsset/Liability\nManagement ( continued\n)\n\nfunding in relation to\ntheir assets,\nderivative exposures\nand commitments over a\none-year horizon\nperiod. Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio As of\nJune 30, 2020 , the\nconsolidated Company,\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A.\nand Wells Fargo\nNational Bank West were\nabove the minimum LCR\nrequirement of 100%,\nwhich is calculated as\nHQLA divided by\nprojected net cash\noutflows, as each is\ndefined under the LCR\nrule. Table 31 presents\nthe Company\u2019s quarterly\naverage values for the\ndaily-calculated LCR\nand its components\ncalculated pursuant to\nthe LCR rule\nrequirements.

These assets make up our primary\nsources of liquidity which are presented in\nTable 32 . Our primary sources of liquidity\nare substantially the same in composition as\nHQLA under the LCR rule; however, our primary\nsources of liquidity will generally exceed\nHQLA calculated under the LCR rule due to the\napplicable haircuts to HQLA and the exclusion\nof excess HQLA at our subsidiary IDIs required\nunder the LCR rule. Our cash is predominantly\non deposit with the Federal Reserve. Debt\nsecurities included as part of our primary\nsources of liquidity are comprised of U.S.\nTreasury and federal agency debt, and\nmortgage-backed securities issued by federal\nagencies within our debt securities portfolio.\nWe believe these debt securities provide quick\nsources of liquidity through sales or by\npledging to obtain financing, regardless of\nmarket conditions. Some of these debt\nsecurities are within our held-to-maturity\nportfolio and as such are not intended for\nsale, but may be pledged to obtain financing.\nSome of the legal entities within our\nconsolidated group of companies are subject to\nvarious regulatory, tax, legal and other\nrestrictions that can limit the\ntransferability of their funds. We believe we\nmaintain adequate liquidity for these entities\nin consideration of such funds transfer\nrestrictions.\n\nTable 32: Primary Sources of Liquidity\n                                              \n        J\u2026                    D\u2026              \n        3\u2026                    3\u2026              \n        2\u2026                    2\u2026              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026     T\u2026    E\u2026    U\u2026    T\u2026        E\u2026    U\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026  $  2\u2026     \u2014    2\u2026    1\u2026         \u2014    1\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026     5\u2026    3\u2026    5\u2026    6\u2026        3\u2026    5\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026     2\u2026    3\u2026    2\u2026    2\u2026        4\u2026    2\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026  $  5\u2026    4\u2026    5\u2026    4\u2026        4\u2026    3\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Included in encumbered securities      \n       atJune\u00a030, 2020, were securities with  \n  (1)  a fair value of$2.0 billion, which     \n       were purchased inJune 2020, but        \n       settled in July 2020.                  \n                                              \nIn addition to our primary sources of\nliquidity shown in Table 32 , liquidity is\nalso available through the sale or financing\nof other debt securities including trading\nand/or available-for-sale debt securities, as\nwell as through the sale, securitization or\nfinancing of loans, to the extent such debt\nsecurities and loans are not encumbered. As of\nJune 30, 2020 , we also maintained\napproximately $276.1 billion of available\nborrowing capacity at various Federal Home\nLoan Banks and the Federal Reserve Discount\nWindow. Deposits have historically provided a\nsizable source of relatively low-cost funds.\nDeposits were 151% of total loans at June 30,\n2020 , and 137% at December 31, 2019 .\nAdditional funding is provided by long-term\ndebt and short-term borrowings. Table 33 shows\nselected information for short-term\nborrowings, which generally mature in less\nthan 30 days.

We issue long-term\ndebt in a variety of maturities and currencies\nto achieve cost-efficient funding and to\nmaintain an appropriate maturity profile.\nProceeds from securities issued were used for\ngeneral corporate purposes, and, unless\notherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus or prospectus supplement, we expect\nthe proceeds from securities issued in the\nfuture will be used for the same purposes.\nLong-term debt of $230.9 billion at June 30,\n2020 , increased $2.7 billion from December\n31, 2019 .

Rating agencies\nbase their ratings on many quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including capital\nadequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business\nmix, the level and quality of earnings, and\nrating agency assumptions regarding the\nprobability and extent of federal financial\nassistance or support for certain large\nfinancial institutions. Adverse changes in\nthese factors could result in a reduction of\nour credit rating; however, our debt\nsecurities do not contain credit rating\ncovenants. On April 22, 2020, Fitch Ratings,\nInc. (Fitch) affirmed the Company\u2019s long-term\nand short-term issuer default ratings and\nrevised the rating outlook to negative from\nstable as Fitch expects significant operating\nenvironment headwinds from the disruption to\neconomic activity and financial markets as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic. This rating\naction followed Fitch\u2019s event-driven review of\nthe commercially-oriented U.S. global\nsystemically important banks (G-SIBs). On May\n21, 2020, DBRS Morningstar confirmed the\nCompany\u2019s ratings and revised the rating trend\nto negative from stable, citing the economic\ndisruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. On\nJuly 22, 2020, Standard & Poor's (S&P) Global\nRatings lowered the long-term rating of the\nCompany to BBB+ from A- and revised the rating\noutlook to stable from negative. See the \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d section in our 2019 Form 10-K for\nadditional information regarding our credit\nratings and the potential impact a credit\nrating downgrade would have on our liquidity\nand operations, as well as Note 15\n(Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this\nReport for information regarding additional\ncollateral and funding obligations required\nfor certain derivative instruments in the\nevent our credit ratings were to fall below\ninvestment grade.

We are a member of the\nFHLBs based in Dallas, Des Moines and San\nFrancisco. Each member of the FHLBs is\nrequired to maintain a minimum investment in\ncapital stock of the applicable FHLB. The\nboard of directors of each FHLB can increase\nthe minimum investment requirements in the\nevent it has concluded that additional capital\nis required to allow it to meet its own\nregulatory capital requirements. Any increase\nin the minimum investment requirements outside\nof specified ranges requires the approval of\nthe Federal Housing Finance Agency. Because\nthe extent of any obligation to increase our\ninvestment in any of the FHLBs depends\nentirely upon the occurrence of a future\nevent, potential future payments to the FHLBs\nare not determinable. LIBOR TRANSITION Due to\nuncertainty surrounding the suitability and\nsustainability of the London Interbank Offered\nRate (LIBOR), central banks and global\nregulators have called for financial market\nparticipants to prepare for the\ndiscontinuation of LIBOR by the end of 2021.\nLIBOR is a widely-referenced benchmark rate,\nwhich is published in five currencies and a\nrange of tenors, and seeks to estimate the\ncost at which banks can borrow on an unsecured\nbasis from other banks. We have a significant\nnumber of assets and liabilities referenced to\nLIBOR and other interbank offered rates\n(IBORs), such as commercial loans, adjustable-\nrate mortgage loans, derivatives, debt\nsecurities, and long-term debt. Accordingly,\nwe established a LIBOR Transition Office (LTO)\nin February 2018, with senior management and\nBoard oversight. The LTO is responsible for\ndeveloping a coordinated strategy to\ntransition the IBOR-linked contracts and\nprocesses across Wells Fargo to alternative\nreference rates and serves as the primary\nconduit between Wells Fargo and relevant\nindustry groups, such as the Alternative\nReference Rates Committee (ARRC). In addition,\nthe Company is actively working with\nregulators, industry working groups (such as\nthe ARRC) and trade associations that are\ndeveloping guidance to facilitate an orderly\ntransition away from the use of LIBOR. We are\nclosely monitoring and seeking to follow the\nrecommendations and guidance announced by such\norganizations, including those announced by\nthe ARRC and the Bank of England\u2019s Working\nGroup on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates.\nWe continue to assess the risks and related\nimpacts associated with a transition away from\nIBORs. See the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in the\n2019 Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding the potential impact of a benchmark\nrate, such as LIBOR, or other referenced\nfinancial metric being significantly changed,\nreplaced, or discontinued. On March 12, 2020,\nthe Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(FASB) issued ASU 2020-04 \u2013 Facilitation of\nthe Effects of Reference Rate Reform on\nFinancial Reporting (Update) that provides\ntemporary relief from existing GAAP accounting\nrequirements for entities that perform\nactivities related to reference rate reform.\nThe relief provided by the Update is primarily\nrelated to contract modifications and hedge\naccounting relationships that are impacted by\nthe Company\u2019s reference rate reform\nactivities. For additional information on the\nUpdate, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) to Financial Statements\nin this Report. For additional information on\nthe amount of our IBOR-linked assets and\nliabilities, as well as the program structure\nand initiatives created by the LTO, see the\n\u201cRisk Management \u2013 Asset/Liability Management\n\u2013 LIBOR Transition\u201d section in our 2019 Form\n10-K. 47\n                                              \n              Capital Management              \n                                              \nWe have an active\nprogram for managing\ncapital through a\ncomprehensive process\nfor assessing the\nCompany\u2019s overall\ncapital adequacy. Our\nobjective is to\nmaintain capital at an\namount commensurate\nwith our risk profile\nand risk tolerance\nobjectives, and to meet\nboth regulatory and\nmarket expectations. We\nprimarily fund our\nworking capital needs\nthrough the retention\nof earnings net of both\ndividends and share\nrepurchases, as well as\nthrough the issuance of\npreferred stock and\nlong and short-term\ndebt. Retained earnings\ndecreased $6.7 billion\nfrom December 31, 2019\n, predominantly as a\nresult of common and\npreferred stock\ndividends of $4.9\nbillion and net losses\nof $1.7 billion .\nDuring second quarter\n2020 , we issued $367\nmillion of common\nstock, excluding\nconversions of\npreferred shares. On\nMarch 15, 2020, we\nsuspended our share\nrepurchase activities\nfor the remainder of\nthe first quarter and\nfor second quarter 2020\n. On June 25, 2020, the\nFRB announced that it\nwas prohibiting large\nBHCs subject to the\nFRB\u2019s capital plan\nrule, including Wells\nFargo, from making any\ncapital distribution\n(excluding any capital\ndistribution arising\nfrom the issuance of a\ncapital instrument\neligible for inclusion\nin the numerator of a\nregulatory capital\nratio), unless\notherwise approved by\nthe FRB. Through the\nend of third quarter\n2020, the FRB\nauthorized certain\nlimited exceptions to\nthis prohibition, which\nare described in the\n\u201cCapital Planning and\nStress Testing\u201d section\nbelow. For additional\ninformation about\ncapital distributions,\nsee the \u201cCapital\nPlanning and Stress\nTesting\u201d and\n\u201cSecurities\nRepurchases\u201d sections\nbelow. In January 2020,\nwe issued $2.0 billion\nof our Preferred Stock,\nSeries Z. In March\n2020, we redeemed the\nremaining $1.8 billion\nof our Preferred Stock,\nSeries K, and redeemed\n$669 million of our\nPreferred Stock, Series\nT. For more\ninformation, see Note\n17 (Preferred Stock) to\nFinancial Statements in\nthis Report. On July\n28, 2020, the Company\nreduced its third\nquarter 2020 common\nstock dividend to $0.10\nper share. Regulatory\nCapital Guidelines The\nCompany and each of our\nIDIs are subject to\nvarious regulatory\ncapital adequacy\nrequirements\nadministered by the FRB\nand the OCC. Risk-based\ncapital (RBC)\nguidelines establish a\nrisk-adjusted ratio\nrelating capital to\ndifferent categories of\nassets and off-balance\nsheet exposures as\ndiscussed below. RISK-\nBASED CAPITAL AND RISK-\nWEIGHTED ASSETS The\nCompany is subject to\nrules issued by federal\nbanking regulators to\nimplement Basel III\ncapital requirements\nfor U.S. banking\norganizations. The\nfederal banking\nregulators\u2019 capital\nrules, among other\nthings, required on a\nfully phased-in basis\nas of June 30, 2020 :\n                                              \n     a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)    \n     ratio of 9.00%, comprised of a 4.50%     \n     minimum requirement plus a capital       \n  \u2022  conservation buffer of 2.50% and for     \n     us, as a global systemically important   \n     bank (G-SIB), a capital surcharge of     \n     2.00%;                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of        \n     10.50%, comprised of a 6.00% minimum     \n  \u2022  requirement plus the capital             \n     conservation buffer of 2.50% and the     \n     G-SIB capital surcharge of 2.00%;        \n                                              \n                                              \n     a minimum total capital ratio of         \n     12.50%, comprised of a 8.00% minimum     \n  \u2022  requirement plus the capital             \n     conservation buffer of 2.50% and the     \n     G-SIB capital surcharge of 2.00%;        \n                                              \n                                              \n     a potential countercyclical buffer of    \n     up to 2.50% to be added to the minimum   \n     capital ratios, which could be imposed   \n  \u2022  by regulators at their discretion if it  \n     is determined that a period of           \n     excessive credit growth is contributing  \n     to an increase in systemic risk; and     \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of       \n     4.00%.                                   \n                                              \nThe Basel III capital\nrequirements for\ncalculating CET1 and\ntier 1 capital, along\nwith risk-weighted\nassets (RWAs), are\nfully phased-in.\nHowever, the\nrequirements for\ndetermining tier 2 and\ntotal capital are still\nin accordance with\nTransition Requirements\nand are scheduled to be\nfully phased-in by the\nend of 2021. The Basel\nIII capital rules\ncontain two frameworks\nfor calculating capital\nrequirements, a\nStandardized Approach\nand an Advanced\nApproach applicable to\ncertain institutions,\nincluding Wells Fargo.\nAccordingly, in the\nassessment of our\ncapital adequacy, we\nmust report the lower\nof our CET1, tier 1 and\ntotal capital ratios\ncalculated under the\nStandardized Approach\nand under the Advanced\nApproach. The\ndifference between RWAs\nunder the Standardized\nand Advanced Approach\nhas narrowed in recent\nquarters due to\neconomic conditions\nfrom the COVID-19\npandemic impacting our\ncalculation of Advanced\nApproach RWAs. In\nparticular, downgrades\nof loans in our loan\nportfolio, which drive\nnegative credit risk\nmigration, increased\nour Advanced Approach\nRWAs at June 30, 2020 .\nWe expect this trend to\ncontinue if the\neconomic impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\ncontinues to affect our\ncustomer base.\nEffective October 1,\n2020, a stress capital\nbuffer will be included\nin the minimum capital\nratio requirements. The\nstress capital buffer\nis calculated based on\nthe decrease in a BHC\u2019s\nrisk-based capital\nratios under the\nseverely adverse\nscenario in the FRB\u2019s\nannual supervisory\nstress test and related\nComprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review\n(CCAR), plus four\nquarters of planned\ncommon stock dividends.\nThe stress capital\nbuffer will replace the\ncurrent 2.50% capital\nconservation buffer\nunder the Standardized\nApproach. On June 29,\n2020, following the\nFRB\u2019s release of the\nresults of the 2020\nsupervisory stress test\nand related CCAR, the\nCompany announced that\nit expects its stress\ncapital buffer to be\n2.50% , which is the\nlowest possible under\nthe new framework and\nwould keep the\nregulatory minimum for\nthe Company\u2019s CET1\nratio at 9.00%. The FRB\nhas indicated that it\nwill publish the final\nstress capital buffer\nfor each BHC by August\n31, 2020. Because the\nstress capital buffer\nis calculated annually\nas part of the FRB\u2019s\nsupervisory stress test\nand related CCAR and\nwill be based on data\nthat can differ over\ntime, our stress\ncapital buffer, and\nthus the regulatory\nminimums for our\ncapital ratios, are\nsubject to change in\nfuture years. As a\nG-SIB, we are also\nsubject to the FRB\u2019s\nrule implementing the\nadditional capital\nsurcharge of between\n1.00-4.50% on the\nminimum capital\nrequirements of G-SIBs.\nUnder the rule, we must\nannually calculate our\nsurcharge under two\nmethods and use the\nhigher of the two\nsurcharges. The first\nmethod (method one)\nconsiders our size,\ninterconnectedness,\ncross-jurisdictional\nactivity,\nsubstitutability, and\ncomplexity, consistent\nwith the methodology\ndeveloped by the BCBS\nand the Financial\nStability Board (FSB).\nThe second method\n(method two) uses\nsimilar inputs, but\nreplaces\nsubstitutability with\nuse of short-term\nwholesale funding and\nwill generally result\nin higher surcharges\nthan the BCBS\nmethodology. Because\nthe G-SIB capital\nsurcharge is calculated\nannually based on data\nthat can differ\n\n48 Capital Management (\ncontinued ) over time,\nthe amount of the\nsurcharge is subject to\nchange in future years.\nIn second quarter 2020,\nthe Company elected to\napply a modified\ntransition provision\nissued by federal\nbanking regulators in\nMarch 2020 related to\nthe impact of CECL on\nregulatory capital. The\nrule permits certain\nbanking organizations\nto exclude from\nregulatory capital the\ninitial adoption impact\nof CECL, plus 25% of\nthe cumulative changes\nin the ACL under CECL\nfor each period until\nDecember 31, 2021,\nfollowed by a three-\nyear phase-out of the\nbenefits. The tables\nthat follow provide\ninformation about our\nrisk-based capital and\nrelated ratios as\ncalculated under Basel\nIII capital guidelines.\nAlthough we report\ncertain capital amounts\nand ratios in\naccordance with\nTransition Requirements\nfor banking industry\nregulatory reporting\npurposes, we manage our\ncapital based on a\nfully phased-in basis.\nFor information about\nour capital\nrequirements calculated\nin accordance with\nTransition\nRequirements, see Note\n23 (Regulatory and\nAgency Capital\nRequirements) to\nFinancial Statements in\nthis Report.

regulators in March    \n       2020 related to the impact of CECL on  \n       regulatory capital. The rule permits   \n       certain banking organizations to       \n       exclude from regulatory capital the    \n       initial adoption impact of CECL, plus  \n       25% of the cumulative changes in the   \n       ACL under CECL for each period until   \n  (2)  December 31, 2021, followed by a       \n       three-year phase-out of the benefits.  \n       The impact of the CECL transition      \n       provision on our regulatory capital    \n       atJune\u00a030, 2020,was an increase in     \n       capital of $1.9\u00a0billion, reflecting a  \n       $991 million (post-tax) increase in    \n       capital recognized upon our initial    \n       adoption of CECL, offset by 25% of     \n       the $11.4 billion increase in our ACL  \n       under CECL from January 1, 2020,       \n       throughJune\u00a030, 2020.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Under the Advanced Approach the        \n       allowance for credit losses that       \n       exceeds expected credit losses is      \n       eligible for inclusion in Tier 2       \n       Capital, to the extent the excess      \n       allowance does not exceed 0.60% of     \n  (3)  Advanced credit RWAs, and under the    \n       Standardized Approach, the allowance   \n       for credit losses is includable in     \n       Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of          \n       Standardized credit RWAs, in each      \n       case with any excess allowance for     \n       credit losses being deducted from the  \n       respective total RWAs.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       RWAs calculated under the Advanced     \n       Approach utilize a risk-sensitive      \n       methodology, which relies upon the     \n       use of internal credit models based    \n       upon our experience with internal      \n  (4)  rating grades.

Our IDIs are\nrequired to maintain a\nSLR of at least 6.00%\nto be considered well-\ncapitalized under\napplicable regulatory\ncapital adequacy\nguidelines. In April\n2018, the FRB and OCC\nproposed rules\n(Proposed SLR rules)\nthat would replace the\n2.00% supplementary\nleverage buffer with a\nbuffer equal to one-\nhalf of our G-SIB\ncapital surcharge. The\nProposed SLR rules\nwould similarly tailor\nthe current 6.00% SLR\nrequirement for our\nIDIs. In April 2020,\nthe FRB issued an\ninterim final rule that\ntemporarily allows a\nBHC to exclude on-\nbalance sheet amounts\nof U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and deposits\nat Federal Reserve\nBanks from the\ncalculation of its\ntotal leverage exposure\nin the denominator of\nthe SLR. This interim\nfinal rule became\neffective on April 1,\n2020, and expires on\nMarch 31, 2021. In May\n2020, federal banking\nregulators issued an\ninterim final rule that\npermits IDIs to choose\nto similarly exclude\nthese items from the\ndenominator of their\nSLRs; however, if an\nIDI chooses to exclude\nsuch amounts from the\ncalculation of its SLR,\nit will be required to\nrequest approval from\nits primary federal\nbanking regulator\nbefore making capital\ndistributions, such as\npaying dividends, to\nits parent company.

U.S. G-SIBs are required to\nhave a minimum TLAC amount (consisting of CET1\ncapital and additional tier 1 capital issued\ndirectly by the top-tier or covered BHC plus\neligible external long-term debt) equal to the\ngreater of (i) 18.00% of RWAs and (ii) 7.50%\nof total leverage exposure (the denominator of\nthe SLR calculation). Additionally, U.S.\nG-SIBs are required to maintain (i) a TLAC\nbuffer equal to 2.50% of RWAs\n\nplus our applicable G-SIB capital surcharge\ncalculated under method one plus any\napplicable countercyclical buffer to be added\nto the 18.00% minimum and (ii) an external\nTLAC leverage buffer equal to 2.00% of total\nleverage exposure to be added to the 7.50%\nminimum, in order to avoid restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary bonus\npayments. U.S. G-SIBs are also required to\nhave a minimum amount of eligible unsecured\nlong-term debt equal to the greater of (i)\n6.00% of RWAs plus our applicable G-SIB\ncapital surcharge calculated under method two\nand (ii) 4.50% of the total leverage exposure.\nUnder the Proposed SLR rules, the 2.00%\nexternal TLAC leverage buffer would be\nreplaced with a buffer equal to one-half of\nour applicable G-SIB capital surcharge, and\nthe leverage component for calculating the\nminimum amount of eligible unsecured long-term\ndebt would be modified from 4.50% of total\nleverage exposure to 2.50% of total leverage\nexposure plus one-half of our applicable G-SIB\ncapital surcharge. As of June 30, 2020 , our\neligible external TLAC as a percentage of\ntotal risk-weighted assets was 25.33% compared\nwith a required minimum of 22.00% . Similar to\nthe risk-based capital requirements, we\ndetermine minimum required TLAC based on the\ngreater of RWAs determined under the\nStandardized and Advanced approaches. OTHER\nREGULATORY CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MATTERS As\ndiscussed in the \u201cRisk Management \u2013 Asset/\nLiability Management \u2013 Liquidity and Funding \u2013\nLiquidity Standards\u201d section in this Report,\nfederal banking regulators have issued a final\nrule regarding the U.S. implementation of the\nBasel III LCR and a proposed rule regarding\nthe NSFR. Capital Planning and Stress Testing\nOur planned long-term capital structure is\ndesigned to meet regulatory and market\nexpectations. We believe that our long-term\ntargeted capital structure enables us to\ninvest in and grow our business, satisfy our\ncustomers\u2019 financial needs in varying\nenvironments, access markets, and maintain\nflexibility to return capital to our\nshareholders. Our long-term targeted capital\nstructure also considers capital levels\nsufficient to exceed capital requirements\nincluding the G-SIB capital surcharge.\nAccordingly, based on the final Basel III\ncapital rules under the lower of the\nStandardized or Advanced Approaches CET1\ncapital ratios, we currently target a long-\nterm CET1 capital ratio at or in excess of\n10.00%, which includes a 2.00% G-SIB capital\nsurcharge. Our capital targets are subject to\nchange based on various factors, including\nchanges to the regulatory capital framework\nand expectations for large banks promulgated\nby bank regulatory agencies, changes to the\nregulatory minimums for our capital ratios\n(including changes to our stress capital\nbuffer), planned capital actions, changes in\nour risk profile and other factors. Under the\nFRB\u2019s capital plan rule, large BHCs are\nrequired to submit capital plans annually for\nreview to determine if the FRB has any\nobjections before making any capital\ndistributions. The rule requires updates to\ncapital plans in the event of material changes\nin a BHC\u2019s risk profile, including as a result\nof any significant acquisitions. The FRB\nassesses, among other things, the overall\nfinancial condition, risk profile, and capital\nadequacy of BHCs when evaluating capital\nplans. Our 2020 capital plan, which was\nsubmitted on April 3, 2020, as part of CCAR,\nincluded a comprehensive capital outlook\nsupported by an assessment of expected sources\nand uses of capital over a given planning\nhorizon under a range of expected and stress\nscenarios. As part of the 2020 CCAR, the FRB\nalso generated a supervisory stress test,\nwhich assumed a sharp decline in the economy\nand significant decline in asset pricing using\nthe information provided by the Company to\nestimate\n\n53 performance. The FRB reviewed the\nsupervisory stress test results both as\nrequired under the Dodd-Frank Act using a\ncommon set of capital actions for all large\nBHCs and by taking into account the Company\u2019s\nproposed capital actions. The FRB published\nits supervisory stress test results as\nrequired under the Dodd-Frank Act on June 25,\n2020. On June 25, 2020, the FRB also announced\nthat it is requiring large BHCs, including\nWells Fargo, to update and resubmit their\ncapital plans within 45 days after the FRB\nprovides updated scenarios. Requiring\nresubmission will prohibit each BHC from\nmaking any capital distribution (excluding any\ncapital distribution arising from the issuance\nof a capital instrument eligible for inclusion\nin the numerator of a regulatory capital\nratio), unless otherwise approved by the FRB.\nThrough the end of third quarter 2020, the FRB\nis authorizing each BHC to (i) make share\nrepurchases relating to issuances of common\nstock related to employee stock ownership\nplans; (ii) provided that the BHC does not\nincrease the amount of its common stock\ndividends, pay common stock dividends that do\nnot exceed an amount equal to the average of\nthe BHC\u2019s net income for the four preceding\ncalendar quarters, unless otherwise specified\nby the FRB; and (iii) make scheduled payments\non additional tier 1 and tier 2 capital\ninstruments. These provisions may be extended\nby the FRB quarter-by-quarter. Concurrently\nwith CCAR, federal banking regulators also\nrequire large BHCs and banks to conduct their\nown stress tests to evaluate whether the\ninstitution has sufficient capital to continue\nto operate during periods of adverse economic\nand financial conditions. These stress testing\nrequirements set forth the timing and type of\nstress test activities large BHCs and banks\nmust undertake as well as rules governing\nstress testing controls, oversight and\ndisclosure requirements. We submitted the\nresults of our stress test to the FRB and\ndisclosed a summary of the results in June\n2020. Securities Repurchases From time to time\nthe Board authorizes the Company to repurchase\nshares of our common stock. Although we\nannounce when the Board authorizes share\nrepurchases, we typically do not give any\npublic notice before we repurchase our shares.\nFuture stock repurchases may be private or\nopen-market repurchases, including block\ntransactions, accelerated or delayed block\ntransactions, forward repurchase transactions,\nand similar transactions. Additionally, we may\nenter into plans to purchase stock that\nsatisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934. Various\nfactors determine the amount of our share\nrepurchases, including our capital\nrequirements, the number of shares we expect\nto issue for employee benefit plans and\nacquisitions, market conditions (including the\ntrading price of our stock), and regulatory\nand legal considerations, including the FRB\u2019s\nresponse to our capital plan and to changes in\nour risk profile. Due to the various factors\nimpacting the amount of our share repurchases\nand the fact that we tend to be in the market\nregularly to satisfy repurchase considerations\nunder our capital plan, our share repurchases\noccur at various price levels. We may suspend\nshare repurchase activity at any time. On\nMarch 15, 2020, we, along with the other\nmembers of the Financial Services Forum,\nsuspended our share repurchase activities for\nthe remainder of the first quarter and for\nsecond quarter 2020. On June 25, 2020, the FRB\nannounced that it was prohibiting large BHCs,\nincluding Wells Fargo, from making any capital\ndistribution (excluding any capital\ndistribution arising from the issuance of a\ncapital instrument eligible for inclusion in\nthe numerator of a regulatory capital ratio),\nunless otherwise approved by the FRB. Through\nthe end of third quarter 2020, the FRB\nauthorized certain limited exceptions to this\nprohibition, which are described in the\n\u201cCapital Planning and Stress Testing\u201d section\nabove. At June 30, 2020 , we had remaining\nBoard authority to repurchase approximately\n168 million shares, subject to regulatory and\nlegal conditions. For more information about\nshare repurchases during second quarter 2020 ,\nsee Part II, Item 2 in this Report.\nHistorically, our policy has been to\nrepurchase shares under the \u201csafe harbor\u201d\nconditions of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 including a limitation on\nthe daily volume of repurchases. Rule 10b-18\nimposes an additional daily volume limitation\non share repurchases during a pending merger\nor acquisition in which shares of our stock\nwill constitute some or all of the\nconsideration. Our management may determine\nthat during a pending stock merger or\nacquisition when the safe harbor would\notherwise be available, it is in our best\ninterest to repurchase shares in excess of\nthis additional daily volume limitation. In\nsuch cases, we intend to repurchase shares in\ncompliance with the other conditions of the\nsafe harbor, including the standing daily\nvolume limitation that applies whether or not\nthere is a pending stock merger or\nacquisition. For additional information about\nshare repurchases, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) to Financial\nStatements in this Report. 54 Regulatory\nMatters ( continued )\n                      \n  Regulatory Matters  \n                      \nSince the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in\n2010, the U.S. financial services industry has\nbeen subject to a significant increase in\nregulation and regulatory oversight\ninitiatives. This increased regulation and\noversight has substantially changed how most\nU.S. financial services companies conduct\nbusiness and has increased their regulatory\ncompliance costs. For a discussion of certain\nconsent orders applicable to the Company, see\nthe \u201cOverview\u201d section in this Report. The\nfollowing supplements our discussion of the\nother significant regulations and regulatory\noversight initiatives that have affected or\nmay affect our business contained in the\n\u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nsections in our 2019 Form 10-K and in our 2020\nFirst Quarter Report on Form 10-Q. REGULATORY\nDEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO COVID-19 In response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic and related events,\nfederal banking regulators have undertaken a\nnumber of measures to help stabilize the\nbanking sector, support the broader economy,\nand facilitate the ability of banking\norganizations like Wells Fargo to continue\nlending to consumers and businesses. For\nexample, in order to facilitate the\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security\nAct (CARES Act), federal banking regulators\nissued interim final rules designed to\nencourage financial institutions to\nparticipate in stimulus measures, such as the\nSmall Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck\nProtection Program and the FRB\u2019s Main Street\nLending Program. Similarly, the FRB launched a\nnumber of lending facilities designed to\nenhance liquidity and the functioning of\nmarkets, including facilities covering money\nmarket mutual funds and term asset-backed\nsecurities loans. Federal banking regulators\nhave also issued several joint interim final\nrules amending the regulatory capital and TLAC\nrules and other prudential regulations to ease\ncertain restrictions on banking organizations\nand encourage the use of certain FRB-\nestablished facilities in order to further\npromote lending to consumers and businesses.\nIn addition, the OCC and the FRB have issued\nguidelines for banks and BHCs related to\nworking with customers affected by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, including guidance with\nrespect to waiving fees, offering repayment\naccommodations, providing payment deferrals,\nand increasing daily withdrawal limits at\nautomated teller machines. In addition, the\nfederal government has instituted a moratorium\non certain mortgage foreclosure activities.\nAny current or future rules, regulations, and\nguidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic and\nits impacts could require us to change certain\nof our business practices, reduce our revenue\nand earnings, impose additional costs on us,\nor otherwise adversely affect our business\noperations and/or competitive position. 55\n                                \n  Critical Accounting Policies  \n                                \nOur significant\naccounting policies\n(see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial\nStatements in our 2019\nForm 10-K) are\nfundamental to\nunderstanding our\nresults of operations\nand financial condition\nbecause they require\nthat we use estimates\nand assumptions that\nmay affect the value of\nour assets or\nliabilities and\nfinancial results. Five\nof these policies are\ncritical because they\nrequire management to\nmake difficult,\nsubjective and complex\njudgments about matters\nthat are inherently\nuncertain and because\nit is likely that\nmaterially different\namounts would be\nreported under\ndifferent conditions or\nusing different\nassumptions. These\npolicies govern:\n                                       \n  \u2022  the allowance for credit losses;  \n                                       \n                                         \n  \u2022  the valuation of residential MSRs;  \n                                         \n                                              \n  \u2022  the fair value of financial              \n     instruments;                             \n                                              \n                        \n  \u2022  income taxes; and  \n                        \n                                              \n  \u2022  liability for contingent litigation      \n     losses.                                  \n                                              \nManagement and the\nBoard\u2019s Audit Committee\nhave reviewed and\napproved these critical\naccounting policies.\nThese policies are\ndescribed further in\nthe \u201cFinancial Review \u2013\nCritical Accounting\nPolicies\u201d section and\nNote 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial\nStatements in our 2019\nForm 10-K. In\nconnection with our\nadoption of CECL on\nJanuary 1, 2020, we\nhave updated our\ncritical accounting\npolicy for the\nallowance for credit\nlosses. Allowance for\nCredit Losses We\nmaintain an allowance\nfor credit losses (ACL)\nfor loans, which is\nmanagement\u2019s estimate\nof the expected credit\nlosses in the loan\nportfolio and unfunded\ncredit commitments, at\nthe balance sheet date,\nexcluding loans and\nunfunded credit\ncommitments carried at\nfair value or held for\nsale. Additionally, we\nmaintain an allowance\nfor credit losses for\ndebt securities\nclassified as either\nheld-to-maturity (HTM)\nor available-for-sale\n(AFS), other financial\nassets measured at\namortized cost, net\ninvestments in leases,\nand other off-balance\nsheet credit exposures.\nIn connection with our\nadoption of CECL, we\nupdated our approach\nfor estimating expected\ncredit losses, which\nincludes new areas for\nmanagement judgment,\ndescribed more fully\nbelow, and updated our\naccounting policies.\nFor more information,\nsee Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPolicies) to Financial\nStatements in this\nReport. For loans and\nHTM debt securities,\nthe ACL is measured\nbased on the remaining\ncontractual term of the\nfinancial asset\n(including off-balance\nsheet credit exposures)\nadjusted, as\nappropriate, for\nprepayments and\npermitted extension\noptions using\nhistorical experience,\ncurrent conditions, and\nforecasted information.\nFor AFS debt\nsecurities, the ACL is\nmeasured using a\ndiscounted cash flow\napproach and is limited\nto the difference\nbetween the fair value\nof the security and its\namortized cost. Changes\nin the ACL and,\ntherefore, in the\nrelated provision for\ncredit losses can\nmaterially affect net\nincome. In applying the\njudgment and review\nrequired to determine\nthe ACL, management\nconsiderations include\nthe evaluation of past\nevents, historical\nexperience, changes in\neconomic forecasts and\nconditions, customer\nbehavior, collateral\nvalues, and the length\nof the initial loss\nforecast period, and\nother influences. From\ntime to time, changes\nin economic factors or\nassumptions, business\nstrategy, products or\nproduct mix, or debt\nsecurity investment\nstrategy, may result in\na corresponding\nincrease or decrease in\nour ACL. While our\nmethodology attributes\nportions of the ACL to\nspecific financial\nasset classes (loan and\ndebt security\nportfolios)\n\nor loan portfolio\nsegments (commercial\nand consumer), the\nentire ACL is available\nto absorb credit losses\nof the company.\nJudgment is\nspecifically applied\nin:\n                                              \n     Economic assumptions and the length of   \n     the initial loss forecast                \n     period.Forecasted economic variables,    \n     such as gross domestic product (GDP),    \n     unemployment rate or collateral asset    \n     prices, are used to estimate expected    \n     credit losses. While many of these       \n     economic variables are evaluated at the  \n     macro-economy level, some economic       \n     variables may be forecasted at more      \n     granular levels, for example, using the  \n     metro statistical area (MSA) level for   \n     unemployment rates, home prices and      \n  \u2022  commercial real estate prices.           \n     Quarterly, we assess the length of the   \n     initial loss forecast period and have    \n     currently set the period to one year.    \n     Management exercises judgment when       \n     assigning weight to the three economic   \n     scenarios that are used to estimate      \n     future credit losses. The three          \n     scenarios include a most likely          \n     expectation of economic variables        \n     referred to as the base case scenario,   \n     as well as an optimistic (upside)        \n     scenario and a pessimistic (downside)    \n     scenario.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n     Reversion of losses beyond the initial   \n     forecast period.We use a reversion       \n     approach to connect the losses           \n     estimated for our initial loss forecast  \n     period to the period of our historical   \n     loss forecast based on economic          \n     conditions at the measurement date. Our  \n     reversion methodology considers the      \n     type of portfolio, point in the credit   \n     cycle, expected length of recessions     \n  \u2022  and recoveries, as well as other         \n     relevant factors. The length of          \n     reversion period varies by asset type \u2013  \n     one year for shorter contractual term    \n     loans such as commercial loans and two   \n     years for longer contractual term loans  \n     such as real estate 1-4 family mortgage  \n     loans. We assess the reversion approach  \n     on a quarterly basis and the length of   \n     the reversion period by asset type       \n     annually.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n     Historical loss expectations.  At the    \n     end of the reversion period, we          \n     incorporate the changes in economic      \n     variables observed during                \n     representative historical time periods   \n     that include both recessions and         \n  \u2022  expansions. This analysis is used to     \n     compute average losses for any given     \n     portfolio and its associated credit      \n     characteristics. Annually, we assess     \n     the historical time periods and ensure   \n     the average loss estimates are           \n     representative of our historical loss    \n     experience.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n     Credit risk ratings applied to           \n     individual commercial loans, unfunded    \n     credit commitments, and debt             \n     securities.Individually assessed credit  \n     risk ratings are considered key credit   \n     variables in our modeled approaches to   \n     help assess probability of default and   \n     loss given default. Borrower quality     \n     ratings are aligned to the borrower\u2019s    \n  \u2022  financial strength and contribute to     \n     forecasted probability of default        \n     curves. Collateral quality ratings       \n     combined with forecasted collateral      \n     prices (as applicable) contribute to     \n     the forecasted severity of loss in the   \n     event of default. These credit risk      \n     ratings are reviewed by experienced      \n     senior credit officers and subjected to  \n     reviews by an internal team of credit    \n     risk specialists.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n     Usage of credit loss estimation          \n     models.We use internally developed       \n     models that incorporate credit           \n     attributes and economic variables to     \n     generate estimates of credit losses.     \n     Management uses a combination of         \n  \u2022  judgement and quantitative analytics in  \n     the determination of segmentation,       \n     modeling approach, and variables that    \n     are leveraged in the models. These       \n     models are validated in accordance with  \n     the Company\u2019s policies by an internal    \n     model validation group.We routinely      \n     assess our model performance and apply   \n                                              \n56\n\nadjustments when\nnecessary to improve\nthe accuracy of loss\nestimation. We also\nassess our models for\nlimitations against the\ncompany-wide risk\ninventory to help\nensure that we\nappropriately capture\nknown and emerging\nrisks in our estimate\nof expected credit\nlosses and apply\noverlays as needed.\n                                              \n     Valuation of collateral.  The current    \n     fair value of collateral is utilized to  \n     assess the expected credit losses when   \n     a financial asset is considered to be    \n     collateral dependent. We apply judgment  \n     when valuing the collateral either       \n     through appraisals, evaluation of the    \n  \u2022  cash flows of the property, or other     \n     quantitative techniques. Decreases in    \n     collateral valuations support            \n     incremental charge-downs and increases   \n     in collateral valuation are included in  \n     the allowance for credit losses as a     \n     negative allowance when the financial    \n     asset has been previously written-down   \n     below current recovery value.            \n                                              \n                                              \n     Contractual term considerations.The      \n     remaining contractual term of a loan is  \n     adjusted for expected prepayments and    \n     certain expected extensions, renewals,   \n     or modifications. We extend the          \n  \u2022  contractual term when we are not able    \n     to unconditionally cancel contractual    \n     renewals or extension options. We also   \n     incorporate into our allowance for       \n     credit losses any scenarios where we     \n     reasonably expect to provide an          \n     extension through a TDR.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n     Qualitative factors which may not be     \n     adequately captured in the loss          \n     models.These amounts represent           \n     management\u2019s judgment of risks inherent  \n     in the processes and assumptions used    \n  \u2022  in establishing the ACL. We also         \n     consider economic environmental          \n     factors, modeling assumptions and        \n     performance, process risk, and other     \n     subjective factors, including industry   \n     trends and emerging risk assessments.    \n                                              \nSensitivity The ACL for loans is sensitive to\nchanges in key assumptions which requires\nsignificant judgment to be used by management.\nFuture amounts of the ACL for loans will be\nbased on a variety of factors, including loan\nbalance changes, portfolio credit quality, and\ngeneral economic conditions. General economic\nconditions are forecasted using economic\nvariables, which could have varying impacts on\ndifferent financial assets or portfolios.\nAdditionally, throughout numerous credit\ncycles, there are observed changes in economic\nvariables such as the unemployment rate, GDP\nand real estate prices which may not move in a\ncorrelated manner as variables may move in\nopposite directions or differ across\nportfolios or geography.\n\nIn our sensitivity analysis, we applied 50%\nweight to both the base case scenario and the\ndownside scenario to reflect the potential for\nfurther economic deterioration from a COVID-19\nresurgence. The outcomes of both scenarios\nwere influenced by the duration, severity, and\ntiming of changes in economic variables within\nthose scenarios. The result of the sensitivity\nanalysis would have increased the ACL for\nloans by approximately $5.0 billion at June\n30, 2020. This hypothetical increase in our\nACL for loans represents changes to our\nquantitative estimate and does not incorporate\nthe impact of management judgment for\nqualitative factors applied in the current ACL\nfor loans, which may have a positive or\nnegative effect on the results. Also, if this\nhypothetical result were to actually\nmaterialize, the increase in our ACL for loans\nmay be recognized over time if actual loss\nexpectations exceed our historical loss\nexperience. This sensitivity analysis does not\nrepresent management\u2019s view of expected credit\nlosses at the balance sheet date. The\nsensitivity analysis excludes the ACL for debt\nsecurities given its size relative to the\noverall ACL. Management believes that the\nestimate for the ACL for loans was appropriate\nat the balance sheet date. Because significant\njudgment is used, it is possible that others\nperforming similar analyses could reach\ndifferent conclusions.\n\n57\n                                   \n  Current Accounting Developments  \n                                   \nTable 42 provides the significant accounting\nupdates applicable to us that have been issued\nby the Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(FASB) but are not yet effective.

For\na discussion of risk factors that could\nadversely affect our financial results and\ncondition, and the value of, and return on, an\ninvestment in the Company, we refer you to the\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in our 2019 Form 10-K.\nThe following risk factor supplements the\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in our 2019 Form 10-K.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted\nour business and financial results, and the\nultimate impact will depend on future\ndevelopments, which are highly uncertain and\ncannot be predicted, including the scope and\nduration of the pandemic and actions taken by\ngovernmental authorities in response to the\npandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively\nimpacted the global economy, disrupted global\nsupply chains, lowered equity market\nvaluations, created significant volatility and\ndisruption in financial markets, and increased\nunemployment levels. In addition, the pandemic\nhas resulted in temporary closures of many\nbusinesses and the institution of social\ndistancing and sheltering in place\nrequirements in many states and communities.\nAs a result, the demand for our products and\nservices may continue to be significantly\nimpacted, which could adversely affect our\nrevenue. Furthermore, the pandemic could\ncontinue to result in the recognition of\ncredit losses in our loan portfolios and\nincreases in our allowance for credit losses,\nparticularly if businesses remain closed, the\nimpact on the global economy worsens, or more\ncustomers draw on their lines of credit or\nseek additional loans to help finance their\nbusinesses. Similarly, because of changing\neconomic and market conditions affecting\nissuers, we may be required to recognize\nfurther impairments on the securities we hold,\nas well as reductions in other comprehensive\nincome. Moreover, the persistence of adverse\neconomic conditions and reduced revenue may\nadversely affect the fair value of our\noperating segments and underlying reporting\nunits which may result in goodwill impairment.\nOur business operations may be further\ndisrupted if significant portions of our\nworkforce are unable to work effectively,\nincluding because of illness, quarantines,\ngovernment actions, or other restrictions in\nconnection with the pandemic, and we have\nalready temporarily closed certain of our\nbranches and offices. Moreover, the pandemic\nhas created additional operational and\ncompliance risks, including the need to\nquickly implement and execute new programs and\nprocedures for the products and services we\noffer our customers, provide enhanced safety\nmeasures for our employees and customers,\ncomply with rapidly changing regulatory\nrequirements, address any increased risk of\nfraudulent activity, and protect the integrity\nand functionality of our systems and networks\nas a larger number of our employees work\nremotely. The pandemic could also result in or\ncontribute to additional downgrades to our\ncredit ratings or credit outlook. In response\nto the pandemic, we have suspended residential\nproperty foreclosure sales and evictions, and\nare offering fee waivers, payment deferrals,\nand other expanded assistance for credit card,\nautomobile, mortgage, small business, personal\nand commercial lending customers, and future\ngovernmental actions may require these and\nother types of customer-related responses. In\naddition, we have reduced our common stock\ndividend and temporarily suspended share\nrepurchases, and we could take, or be required\nto take, other capital actions in the future.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic\nimpacts our business, results of operations,\nand financial condition, as well as our\nregulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will\ndepend on future developments, which are\nhighly uncertain and cannot be predicted,\nincluding the scope and duration of the\npandemic and actions taken by governmental\nauthorities and other third parties in\nresponse to the pandemic. 61 Controls and\nProcedures\n                                              \n      Disclosure Controls and Procedures      \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s management evaluated the\neffectiveness, as of June 30, 2020 , of the\nCompany\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures.\nThe Company\u2019s chief executive officer and\nchief financial officer participated in the\nevaluation.

Projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls\nmay become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate. No change occurred during second\nquarter 2020 that has materially affected, or\nis reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting. 62\n

Indirect\ninterests held through\nrelated parties in\ncommon control\narrangements will be\nconsidered on a\nproportional basis for\ndetermining whether\nfees paid to decision-\nmakers and service\nproviders are variable\ninterests. This is\nconsistent with how\nindirect interests held\nthrough related parties\nunder common control\nare considered for\ndetermining whether a\nreporting entity must\nconsolidate a VIE. The\nUpdate did not have a\nmaterial impact on our\nconsolidated financial\nstatements.\nASU 2018-15 clarifies\nthe accounting for\nimplementation costs\nrelated to a cloud\ncomputing arrangement\nthat is a service\ncontract and enhances\ndisclosures around\nimplementation costs\nfor internal-use\nsoftware and cloud\ncomputing arrangements.\nThe guidance aligns the\nrequirements for\ncapitalizing\nimplementation costs\nincurred in a hosting\narrangement that is a\nservice contract with\nthe requirements for\ncapitalizing\nimplementation costs\nincurred to develop or\nobtain internal-use\n71 software (and hosting arrangements that\ninclude an internal-use software license). It\nalso requires the expense related to the\ncapitalized implementation costs be presented\nin the same line item in the statement of\nincome as the fees associated with the hosting\nelement of the arrangement and capitalized\nimplementation costs be presented in the\nbalance sheet in the same line item that a\nprepayment for the fees of the associated\nhosting arrangement are presented. The Update\ndid not have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. ASU 2018-13\nclarifies, eliminates and adds certain fair\nvalue measurement disclosure requirements for\nassets and liabilities, which affects our\ndisclosures in Note 16 (Fair Values of Assets\nand Liabilities). Although the ASU became\neffective on January 1, 2020, it permitted\nearly adoption of individual requirements\nwithout causing others to be early adopted\nand, as such, we partially adopted the Update\nduring third quarter 2018 and the remainder of\nthe requirements in first quarter 2020. The\nUpdate did not have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. ASU 2017-04\nsimplifies the goodwill impairment test by\neliminating the requirement to assign the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit to all of the assets\nand liabilities of that unit (including any\nunrecognized intangible assets) as if the\nreporting unit had been acquired in a business\ncombination. The Update requires that a\ngoodwill impairment loss is recognized if the\nfair value of the reporting unit is less than\nthe carrying amount, including goodwill. The\ngoodwill impairment loss is limited to the\namount of goodwill allocated to the reporting\nunit. The guidance did not change the\nqualitative assessment of goodwill. This\nguidance is applied on a prospective basis,\nand accordingly, the Update did not have a\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements. ASU 2016-13 changes the accounting\nfor the measurement of credit losses on loans\nand debt securities. For loans and held-to-\nmaturity (HTM) debt securities, the Update\nrequires a current expected credit loss (CECL)\nmeasurement to estimate the allowance for\ncredit losses (ACL) for the remaining\ncontractual term, adjusted for prepayments, of\nthe financial asset (including off-balance\nsheet credit exposures) using historical\nexperience, current conditions, and reasonable\nand supportable forecasts. Also, the Update\neliminates the existing guidance for purchased\ncredit-impaired (PCI) loans, but requires an\nallowance for purchased financial assets with\nmore than an insignificant deterioration of\ncredit since origination. In addition, the\nUpdate modifies the other-than-temporary\nimpairment (OTTI) model for available-for-sale\n(AFS) debt securities to require an allowance\nfor credit impairment instead of a direct\nwrite-down, which allows for reversal of\ncredit impairments in future periods based on\nimprovements in credit. Upon adoption, we\nrecognized an overall decrease in our ACL of\napproximately $ 1.3billion (pre-tax) as a\ncumulative effect adjustment from a change in\naccounting policies, which increased our\nretained earnings and regulatory capital\namounts and ratios. Loans previously\nclassified as PCI were automatically\ntransitioned to purchased credit-deteriorated\n(PCD) classification. We recognized an ACL for\nthese new PCD loans and made a corresponding\nadjustment to the loan balance, with no impact\nto net income or transition adjustment to\nretained earnings.

NONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE, AND\nCHARGE-OFF POLICIES We generally place debt\nsecurities on nonaccrual status using factors\nsimilar to those described for loans. When we\nplace a debt security on nonaccrual status, we\nreverse the accrued unpaid interest receivable\nagainst interest income and suspend the\namortization of premiums and accretion of\ndiscounts. If the ultimate collectability of\nthe principal is in doubt on a nonaccrual debt\nsecurity, any cash collected is first applied\nto reduce the security\u2019s amortized cost basis\nto zero, followed by recovery of amounts\npreviously charged off, and subsequently to\ninterest income. Generally, we return a debt\nsecurity to accrual status when all delinquent\ninterest and principal become current under\nthe contractual terms of the security and\ncollectability of remaining principal and\ninterest is no longer doubtful. Our debt\nsecurities are considered past due when\ncontractually required principal or interest\npayments have not been made on the due dates.\nOur charge-off policy for debt securities are\nsimilar to those described for loans.\nSubsequent to charge-off, the debt security\nwill be designated as nonaccrual and follow\nthe process described above for any cash\nreceived. Allowance for Credit Losses The ACL\nis management\u2019s estimate of the current\nexpected credit losses in the loan portfolio\nand unfunded credit commitments, at the\nbalance sheet date, excluding loans and\nunfunded credit commitments carried at fair\nvalue or held for sale. Additionally, we\nmaintain an ACL on AFS and HTM debt\nsecurities, other financing receivables\nmeasured at amortized cost, and other off-\nbalance sheet credit exposures. While we\nattribute portions of the allowance to\nspecific financial asset classes (loan and\ndebt security portfolios), loan portfolio\nsegments (commercial and consumer) or major\nsecurity type, the entire ACL is available to\nabsorb credit losses of the Company. Our ACL\nprocess involves procedures to appropriately\nconsider the unique risk characteristics of\nour financial asset classes, portfolio\nsegments, and major security types. For each\nloan portfolio segment and each major HTM debt\nsecurity type, losses are estimated\ncollectively for groups of loans or securities\nwith similar risk characteristics. For loans\nand securities that do not share similar risk\ncharacteristics with other financial assets,\nthe losses are estimated individually, which\nprimarily includes our impaired large\ncommercial loans and non-accruing HTM debt\nsecurities. For AFS debt securities, losses\nare estimated at the tax-lot level. Our ACL\namounts are influenced by a variety of\nfactors, including changes in loan and debt\nsecurity volumes, portfolio credit quality,\nand general economic conditions. General\neconomic conditions are forecasted using\neconomic variables which will create\nvolatility as those variables change over\ntime. See Table 1.2 for key economic variables\nused for our loan portfolios.\n\n73\n\nTable 1.2: Key Economic Variables\n                                              \n  Loan Portfolio        Key economic          \n                        variables             \n                        \u2022      Gross          \n                        domestic product      \n                        \u2022      Commercial     \n                        real estate asset     \n                        prices, where         \n  Total commercial      applicable            \n                        \u2022      Unemployment   \n                        rate                  \n                        \u2022      Corporate      \n                        investment-grade      \n                        bond spreads          \n                        \u2022      Home price     \n  Real estate 1-4       index                 \n  family mortgage       \u2022      Unemployment   \n                        rate                  \n  Other consumer                              \n  (including credit                           \n  card,                 \u2022      Unemployment   \n  automobile, and       rate                  \n  other revolving                             \n  credit                                      \n  and installment)                            \n                                              \nOur approach for\nestimating expected\nlife-time credit losses\nfor loans and debt\nsecurities includes the\nfollowing key\ncomponents:\n                                              \n     An initial loss forecast period of one   \n     year for all portfolio segments and      \n     classes of financing receivables and     \n  \u2022  off-balance-sheet credit exposures.      \n     This period reflects management\u2019s        \n     expectation of losses based on           \n     forward-looking economic scenarios over  \n     that time.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n     A historical loss forecast period        \n     covering the remaining contractual       \n     term, adjusted for expected prepayments  \n     and certain expected extensions,         \n     renewals, or modifications, by           \n  \u2022  portfolio segment and class of           \n     financing receivables based on the       \n     changes in key historical economic       \n     variables during representative          \n     historical expansionary and              \n     recessionary periods.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n     A reversion period of up to two years    \n     to connect the losses estimated for our  \n     initial loss forecast period to the      \n     period of our historical loss forecast   \n     based on economic conditions at the      \n  \u2022  measurement date.

A financial asset is\ncollateral-dependent when the borrower is\nexperiencing financial difficulty and\nrepayment is expected to be provided\nsubstantially through the sale or operation of\nthe collateral. When a collateral-dependent\nfinancial asset is probable of foreclosure, we\nwill measure the ACL based on the fair value\nof the collateral. If we intend to sell the\nunderlying collateral, we will measure the ACL\nbased on the collateral\u2019s net realizable value\n(fair value of collateral, less estimated\ncosts to sell). In most situations, based on\nour charge-off policies, we will immediately\nwrite-down the financial asset to the fair\nvalue of the collateral or net realizable\nvalue. For consumer loans, collateral-\ndependent financial assets may have collateral\nin the form of residential real estate,\nautomobiles or other personal assets. For\ncommercial loans, collateral-dependent\nfinancial assets may have collateral in the\nform of commercial real estate or other\nbusiness assets. We do not generally record an\nACL for accrued interest receivables because\nuncollectible accrued interest is reversed\nthrough interest income in a timely manner in\nline with our non-accrual and past due\npolicies for loans and debt securities. For\nconsumer credit card and certain consumer\nlines of credit, we include an ACL for accrued\ninterest and fees since these loans are not\nplaced on nonaccrual status and written off\nuntil the loan is 180 days past due. Accrued\ninterest receivables are included in other\nassets, except for certain revolving loans,\nsuch as credit card loans. COMMERCIAL LOAN\nPORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY Generally,\ncommercial loans, which include net\ninvestments in lease financing, are assessed\nfor estimated losses by grading each loan\nusing various risk factors as identified\nthrough periodic reviews. Our estimation\napproach for the commercial portfolio reflects\nthe estimated probability of default in\naccordance with the borrower\u2019s financial\nstrength and the severity of loss in the event\nof default, considering the quality of any\nunderlying collateral. Probability of default\nand severity at the time of default are\nstatistically derived through historical\nobservations of default and losses after\ndefault within each credit risk rating. These\nestimates are adjusted as appropriate based on\nadditional analysis of long-term average loss\nexperience compared with previously forecasted\nlosses, external loss data or other risks\nidentified from current economic conditions\nand credit quality trends. The estimated\nprobability of default and severity at the\ntime of default are applied to loan equivalent\nexposures to estimate losses for unfunded\ncredit commitments. CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO\nSEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY For consumer loans, we\ndetermine the allowance at the individual loan\nlevel. When developing historical loss\nexperience, we pool loans, generally by\nproduct types with similar risk\ncharacteristics, such as residential real\nestate mortgages and credit cards. As\n\n74 Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies ( continued ) appropriate and to\nachieve greater accuracy, we may further\nstratify selected portfolios by sub-product,\norigination channel, vintage, loss type,\ngeographic location and other predictive\ncharacteristics. We use pooled loan data such\nas historic delinquency and default and loss\nseverity in the development of our consumer\nloan models, in addition to home price trends,\nunemployment trends, and other economic\nvariables that may influence the frequency and\nseverity of losses in the consumer portfolio.\nAFS PORTFOLIO ACL METHODOLOGY We develop our\nACL estimate for AFS debt securities by\nutilizing a security-level multi-scenario,\nprobability-weighted discounted cash flow\nmodel based on a combination of past events,\ncurrent conditions, as well as reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. The projected cash\nflows are discounted at the security\u2019s\neffective interest rate, except for certain\nvariable rate securities which are discounted\nusing projections of future changes in\ninterest rates, prepayable securities which\nare adjusted for estimated prepayments, and\nsecurities part of a fair value hedge which\nuse hedge-adjusted assumptions. The ACL on an\nAFS debt security is limited to the difference\nbetween its amortized cost basis and fair\nvalue (fair value floor) and reversals of the\nallowance are permitted up to the amount\npreviously recorded. HTM PORTFOLIO ACL\nMETHODOLOGY For most HTM debt securities, the\nACL is measured using an expected loss model,\nsimilar to the methodology used for loans.\nUnlike AFS debt securities, the ACL on an HTM\ndebt security is not limited to the fair value\nfloor. Certain beneficial interests\ncategorized as HTM debt securities utilize a\nsimilar discounted cash flow model as\ndescribed for AFS debt securities, without the\nlimitation of the fair value floor. OTHER\nQUALITATIVE FACTORS The ACL includes amounts\nfor qualitative factors which may not be\nadequately reflected in our loss models. These\namounts represent management\u2019s judgment of\nrisks in the processes and assumptions used in\nestablishing the ACL. Generally, these amounts\nare established at a granular level below our\nloan portfolio segments. We also consider\neconomic environmental factors, modeling\nassumptions and performance, process risk, and\nother subjective factors, including industry\ntrends and emerging risk assessments. OFF-\nBALANCE SHEET CREDIT EXPOSURES Our off-balance\nsheet credit exposures include unfunded loan\ncommitments (generally in the form of\nrevolving lines of credit), financial\nguarantees not accounted for as insurance\ncontracts or derivatives, including standby\nletters of credit, and other similar\ninstruments. For off-balance sheet credit\nexposures, we recognize an ACL associated with\nthe unfunded amounts. We do not recognize an\nACL for commitments that are unconditionally\ncancelable at our discretion. Additionally, we\nrecognize an ACL for financial guarantees that\ncreate off-balance sheet credit exposure, such\nas loans sold with credit recourse and\nfactoring guarantees. ACL for off-balance\nsheet credit exposures are reported as a\nliability in accrued expenses and other\nliabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nOTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS Other financial assets\nare evaluated for expected credit losses.\nThese other financial assets include accounts\nreceivable for fees, receivables from\ngovernment-sponsored entities, such as Federal\nNational Mortgage Association (FNMA) and\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation\n(FHLMC), and GNMA, and other accounts\nreceivable from high-credit quality\ncounterparties, such as central clearing\ncounterparties. Many of these financial assets\nare generally not expected to have an ACL as\nthere is a zero loss expectation (for example,\ngovernment guarantee) or no historical credit\nlosses. Some financial assets, such as loans\nto employees, maintain an ACL that is\npresented on a net basis with the related\namortized cost amounts in other assets on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. Given the nature\nof these financial assets, provision for\ncredit losses is not recognized separately\nfrom the regular income or expense associated\nwith these financial assets. Securities\npurchased under resale agreements are\ngenerally over-collateralized by securities or\ncash and are generally short-term in nature.\nWe have elected the practical expedient for\nthese financial assets given collateral\nmaintenance provisions. These provisions\nrequire that we monitor the collateral value\nand customers are required to replenish\ncollateral, if needed. Accordingly, we\ngenerally do not maintain an ACL for these\nfinancial assets. PURCHASED CREDIT\nDETERIORATED FINANCIAL ASSETS Financial assets\nacquired that are of poor credit quality and\nwith more than an insignificant evidence of\ncredit deterioration since their origination\nor issuance are PCD assets. PCD assets are\nrecorded at their purchase price plus an ACL\nestimated at the time of acquisition. Under\nthis approach, there is no provision for\ncredit losses recognized at acquisition;\nrather, there is a gross-up of the purchase\nprice of the financial asset for the estimate\nof expected credit losses and a corresponding\nACL recorded. Changes in estimates of expected\ncredit losses after acquisition are recognized\nas provision for credit losses (or reversal of\nprovision for credit losses) in subsequent\nperiods. In general, interest income\nrecognition for PCD financial assets is\nconsistent with interest income recognition\nfor the similar non-PCD financial asset.\nTroubled Debt Restructuring and Other Relief\nRelated to COVID-19 On March 25, 2020, the\nU.S. Senate approved the Coronavirus, Aid,\nRelief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES\nAct) providing optional, temporary relief from\naccounting for certain loan modifications as\ntroubled debt restructurings (TDRs). Under the\nCARES Act, TDR relief is available to banks\nfor loan modifications related to the adverse\neffects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\n(COVID-related modifications) granted to\nborrowers that are current as of December 31,\n2019. TDR relief applies to COVID-related\nmodifications made from March 1, 2020, until\nthe earlier of December 31, 2020, or 60 days\nfollowing the termination of the national\nemergency declared by the President of the\nUnited States. In first quarter 2020, we\nelected to apply the TDR relief provided by\nthe CARES Act. On April 7, 2020, federal\nbanking regulators issued the Interagency\nStatement on Loan Modifications and Reporting\nfor Financial Institutions Working with\nCustomers Affected by the Coronavirus\n(Revised) (the Interagency Statement). The\nguidance in the Interagency Statement provides\nadditional TDR relief as it clarifies that it\nis not necessary to consider the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on the financial condition\nof a borrower in connection with a short-term\n(e.g., six months or less) COVID-related\nmodification provided the borrower is current\nat the date the modification program is\nimplemented. For COVID-related modifications\nin the form of payment deferrals, delinquency\nstatus will not advance and loans that were\naccruing at the time the relief is provided\nwill generally not be placed on nonaccrual\nstatus during the deferral period. COVID- 75\nrelated modifications that do not meet the\nprovisions of the CARES Act or the Interagency\nStatement will be assessed for TDR\nclassification. On April 10, 2020, the FASB\nStaff issued Accounting for Lease Concessions\nRelated to the Effects of the COVID-19\nPandemic , a question and answer guide. The\nguide provided an election for leases\naccounted for under Accounting Standards\nCodification (ASC) 842, Leases , that were\nmodified due to COVID-19 and met certain\ncriteria in order to not require a new lease\nclassification test upon modification. In\nsecond quarter 2020, we elected to apply the\nlease modification relief provided by the\nguide. Share Repurchases During the first\nquarter of 2020 and 2019, we repurchased\nshares of our common stock under Rule 10b5-1\nrepurchase plans. On March 15, 2020, we, along\nwith the other members of the Financial\nServices Forum, suspended our share repurchase\nactivities for the remainder of the first\nquarter and for second quarter 2020. On June\n25, 2020, the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (FRB) announced that it\nwas prohibiting large bank holding companies\n(BHCs) subject to the FRB\u2019s capital plan rule,\nincluding Wells Fargo, from making any capital\ndistribution (excluding any capital\ndistribution arising from the issuance of a\ncapital instrument eligible for inclusion in\nthe numerator of a regulatory capital ratio),\nunless otherwise approved by the FRB. Through\nthe end of third quarter 2020, the FRB is\nauthorizing each BHC to (i) make share\nrepurchases relating to issuances of common\nstock related to employee stock ownership\nplans; (ii) provided that the BHC does not\nincrease the amount of its common stock\ndividends, pay common stock dividends that do\nnot exceed an amount equal to the average of\nthe BHC\u2019s net income for the four preceding\ncalendar quarters, unless otherwise specified\nby the FRB; and (iii) make scheduled payments\non additional tier 1 and tier 2 capital\ninstruments. These provisions may be extended\nby the FRB quarter-by-quarter. For more\ninformation about share repurchases, see Note\n1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies)\nin our 2019 Form 10-K.

The FRB\nhas also published guidance regarding its\nsupervisory expectations for capital planning,\nincluding capital policies regarding the\nprocess relating to common stock dividend and\nrepurchase decisions in the FRB\u2019s SR Letter\n15-18. The Parent\u2019s ability to make certain\ncapital distributions is subject to review by\nthe FRB as part of the Parent\u2019s capital plan\nin connection with the FRB\u2019s annual\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(CCAR). Once the FRB\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement becomes effective on October 1,\n2020, the Parent\u2019s ability to take certain\ncapital actions will be subject to the Parent\nmeeting or exceeding certain regulatory\ncapital minimums, which include the stress\ncapital buffer established by the FRB as part\nof the FRB\u2019s annual supervisory stress test\nand related CCAR. On July 28, 2020 , the\nCompany reduced its third quarter 2020 common\nstock dividend to $ 0.10 per share. On June\n25, 2020, the FRB announced that it is\nrequiring large BHCs, including Wells Fargo,\nto update and resubmit their capital plans\nwithin 45 days after the FRB provides updated\nscenarios. Requiring resubmission will\nprohibit each BHC from making any capital\ndistribution (excluding any capital\ndistribution arising from the issuance of a\ncapital instrument eligible for inclusion in\nthe numerator of a regulatory capital ratio),\nunless otherwise approved by the FRB. Through\nthe end of third quarter 2020, the FRB is\nauthorizing each BHC to (i) make share\nrepurchases relating to issuances of common\nstock related to employee stock ownership\nplans; (ii) provided that the BHC does not\nincrease the amount of its common stock\ndividends, pay common stock dividends that do\nnot exceed an amount equal to the average of\nthe BHC\u2019s net income for the four preceding\ncalendar quarters, unless otherwise specified\nby the FRB; and (iii) make scheduled payments\non additional tier 1 and tier 2 capital\ninstruments. These provisions may be extended\nby the FRB quarter-by-quarter.\n\n77\n                             \n  Note 4:Trading Activities  \n                             \nTable 4.1 presents a summary of our trading\nassets and liabilities measured at fair value\nthrough earnings.\n\nTable 4.1: Trading Assets and Liabilities\n                                              \n  (in millions)                               \n  Trading           Jun 30,       Dec 31,     \n  assets:              2020          2019     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Debt           $   74,679        79,733     \n  securities                                  \n  Equity             12,591        27,440     \n  securities                                  \n  Loans held          1,201           972     \n  for sale                                    \n  Gross trading                               \n  derivative         60,644        34,825     \n  assets                                      \n  Netting (1)       (39,885  )    (21,463  )  \n  Total trading                               \n  derivative         20,759        13,362     \n  assets                                      \n  Total trading     109,230       121,507     \n  assets                                      \n  Trading                                     \n  liabilities:                                \n  Short sale         20,213        17,430     \n  Gross trading                               \n  derivative         54,985        33,861     \n  liabilities                                 \n  Netting (1)       (44,901  )    (26,074  )  \n  Total trading                               \n  derivative         10,084         7,787     \n  liabilities                                 \n  Total trading  $   30,297        25,217     \n  liabilities                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents balance sheet netting for   \n       trading derivative asset and           \n  (1)  liability balances, and trading        \n       portfolio level counterparty           \n       valuation adjustments.                 \n                                              \nTable 4.2 provides a summary of the net\ninterest income earned from trading\nsecurities, and net gains and losses due to\nthe realized and unrealized gains and losses\nfrom trading activities.

For more information, see Note   \n       1 (Summary of Significant Accounting   \n       Policies).                             \n                                              \nCredit Quality We monitor credit quality of\ndebt securities by evaluating various\nattributes and utilize such information in our\nevaluation of the appropriateness of the\nallowance for credit losses. The credit\nquality indicators that we most closely\nmonitor include credit ratings and delinquency\nstatus and are based on information as of our\nfinancial statement date. CREDIT RATINGS\nCredit ratings express opinions about the\ncredit quality of a debt security. We\ndetermine the credit rating of a security\naccording to the lowest credit rating made\navailable by national recognized statistical\nrating organizations (NRSRO). Debt securities\nrated investment grade, that is those with\nratings similar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as\ndefined by NRSRO, are generally considered by\nthe rating agencies and market participants to\nbe low credit risk. Conversely, debt\nsecurities rated below investment grade,\nlabeled as \u201cspeculative grade\u201d by the rating\nagencies, are considered to be distinctively\nhigher credit risk than investment grade debt\nsecurities. For debt securities not rated by\nthe NRSRO, we determine an internal credit\ngrade of the debt securities (used for credit\nrisk management purposes) equivalent to the\ncredit ratings assigned by major credit\nagencies. The fair value of available-for-sale\ndebt securities categorized as investment\ngrade based on internal credit grades was $\n1.3billion at June 30, 2020 , and $ 2.2billion\nat December 31, 2019 . Held-to-maturity debt\nsecurities 80 Note 5: Available-for-Sale and\nHeld-to-Maturity Debt Securities (continued)\ncategorized as investment grade based on\ninternal credit grades are not significant .\nIf an internal credit grade was not assigned,\nwe categorized the debt security as non-\ninvestment grade. Table 5.4 shows the\npercentage of fair value of available-for-sale\ndebt securities and amortized cost of held-to-\nmaturity debt securities determined by those\nrated investment grade, inclusive of those\nbased on internal credit grades.\n\nTable 5.4: Investment Grade Debt Securities\n                                              \n  ($                                          \n  in

In prior\nperiods, credit impairment was recorded as a\nwrite-down to the amortized cost basis of the\nsecurity. In the current period, credit\nimpairment is recorded as an allowance for\ncredit losses.

We generally require a fee to extend\nsuch commitments. Certain commitments are\nsubject to loan agreements with covenants\nregarding the financial performance of the\ncustomer or borrowing base formulas on an\nongoing basis that must be met before we are\nrequired to fund the commitment. We may reduce\nor cancel consumer commitments, including home\nequity lines and credit card lines, in\naccordance with the contracts and applicable\nlaw. We may, as a representative for other\nlenders, advance funds or provide for the\nissuance of letters of credit under syndicated\nloan or letter of credit agreements. Any\nadvances are generally repaid in less than a\nweek and would normally require default of\nboth the customer and another lender to expose\nus to loss. The unfunded amount of these\ntemporary advance arrangements totaled\napproximately $ 77.8billion at June 30, 2020 .\nWe issue commercial letters of credit to\nassist customers in purchasing goods or\nservices, typically for international trade.\nAt June 30, 2020 , and December 31, 2019 , we\nhad $ 922.6million and $ 862million ,\nrespectively, of outstanding issued commercial\nletters of credit. We also originate\nmultipurpose lending commitments under which\nborrowers have the option to draw on the\nfacility for different purposes in one of\nseveral forms, including a standby letter of\ncredit. See Note 13 (Guarantees, Pledged\nAssets and Collateral, and Other Commitments)\nfor additional information on standby letters\nof credit. When we make commitments, we are\nexposed to credit risk. The maximum credit\nrisk for these commitments will generally be\nlower than the contractual amount because a\nsignificant portion of these commitments are\nnot funded.

On January 1, 2020, we\nadopted CECL. Additional information on our\nadoption of CECL is included in Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).\nIn second quarter 2020, ACL for loans\nincreased $ 8.4billion driven by current and\nforecasted economic conditions due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. These expected impacts were\nmost significantly affected by anticipated\nchanges to economic variables, as well as\nhigher expected losses in the commercial real\nestate and consumer real estate mortgage loan\nportfolios and expected impacts of lower oil\nprices and deteriorating credit trends on the\noil and gas portfolio.\n\nTable 6.5: Allowance for Credit Losses for\nLoans\n

The credit quality indicators are\ngenerally based on information as of our\nfinancial statement date, with the exception\nof updated Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO)\nscores and updated loan-to-value\n(LTV)/combined LTV (CLTV). We obtain FICO\nscores at loan origination and the scores are\ngenerally updated at least quarterly, except\nin limited circumstances, including compliance\nwith the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).\nGenerally, the LTV and CLTV indicators are\nupdated in the second month of each quarter,\nwith updates no older than March 31, 2020 .\nAmounts disclosed in the credit quality tables\nthat follow are not comparative between\nreported periods due to our adoption of CECL\non January 1, 2020. For more information, see\nNote 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies). COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY\nINDICATORS We manage a consistent process for\nassessing commercial loan credit quality.\nGenerally, commercial loans are subject to\nindividual risk assessment using our internal\nborrower and collateral quality ratings, which\nis our primary credit quality indicator. Our\nratings are aligned to federal banking\nregulators\u2019 definitions of pass and criticized\ncategories with the criticized category\nincluding special mention, substandard,\ndoubtful, and loss categories. Table 6.8\nprovides a breakdown of outstanding commercial\nloans by risk category. In connection with our\nadoption of CECL, credit quality information\nis provided with the year of origination for\nterm loans. Revolving loans may convert to\nterm loans as a result of a contractual\nprovision in the original loan agreement or if\nmodified in a TDR.

Loan delinquency, FICO\ncredit scores and LTV for 1-4 family mortgage\nloans are the primary credit quality\nindicators that we monitor and utilize in our\nevaluation of the appropriateness of the\nallowance for credit losses for the consumer\nportfolio segment. Many of our loss estimation\ntechniques used for the allowance for credit\nlosses rely on delinquency-based models;\ntherefore, delinquency is an important\nindicator of credit quality and the\nestablishment of our allowance for credit\nlosses. Table 6.10 provides the outstanding\nbalances of our consumer portfolio by\ndelinquency status. Payment deferral\nactivities instituted in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic may delay recognition of\ndelinquencies for customers who otherwise\nwould have moved into past due status. In\nconnection with our adoption of CECL, credit\nquality information is provided with the year\nof origination for term loans. Revolving loans\nmay convert to term loans as a result of a\ncontractual provision in the original loan\nagreement or if modified in a TDR. The\nrevolving loans converted to term loans in the\ncredit card loan category represent credit\ncard loans with modified terms that require\npayment over a specific term. 91\n\nTable 6.10: Consumer

CLTV refers to the\ncombination of first mortgage and junior lien\nmortgage (including unused line amounts for\ncredit line products) ratios. LTVs and CLTVs\nare updated quarterly using a cascade approach\nwhich first uses values provided by automated\nvaluation models (AVMs) for the property. If\nan AVM is not available, then the value is\nestimated using the original appraised value\nadjusted by the change in Home Price Index\n(HPI) for the property location. If an HPI is\nnot available, the original appraised value is\nused. The HPI value is normally the only\nmethod considered for high value properties,\ngenerally with an original value of $ 1million\nor more, as the AVM values have proven less\naccurate for these properties. Table 6.12\nshows the most updated LTV and CLTV\ndistribution of the real estate 1-4 family\nfirst and junior lien mortgage loan\nportfolios. We consider the trends in\nresidential real estate markets as we monitor\ncredit risk and establish our allowance for\ncredit losses. In the event of a default, any\nloss should be limited to the portion of the\nloan amount in excess of the net realizable\nvalue of the underlying real estate collateral\nvalue. Certain loans do not have an LTV or\nCLTV due to industry data availability and\nportfolios acquired from or serviced by other\ninstitutions. 95\n\nTable 6.12: Consumer Loan Categories by\nLTV/CLTV and Vintage (1)\n                                              \n     \u2026                                 \u2026      \n     \u2026                                 \u2026      \n     \u2026                                 \u2026      \n     \u2026                                 \u2026      \n     \u2026                                 \u2026      \n     \u2026        \u2026        \u2026               \u2026      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n     \u2026        \u2026        \u2026               \u2026      \n     \u2026        \u2026        \u2026               \u2026      \n     \u2026        \u2026        \u2026               \u2026      \n     2        \u2026        \u2026               \u2026      \n     \u2014        \u2026        \u2026               \u2026      \n     \u2026        \u2026        \u2026               \u2026      \n     5        \u2026        \u2026               \u2014      \n     \u2026        \u2026        \u2026               \u2026      \n                                              \n                                              \n     \u2014        \u2014        \u2014               \u2026      \n     \u2014        \u2014        \u2014               \u2026      \n     \u2014        \u2014        \u2014               \u2026      \n     \u2014        \u2014        \u2014               \u2026      \n     \u2014        \u2014        \u2014               \u2026      \n     \u2026        \u2026        \u2026               \u2026      \n     \u2026        \u2026        \u2026               \u2026      \n     \u2026        \u2026        \u2026               \u2026      \n                                       \u2026      \n                                       \u2026      \n                                       \u2026      \n                                       \u2026      \n                                       \u2026      \n                                       \u2026      \n                                       \u2026      \n                                       \u2026      \n                                       \u2026      \n                                              \n                                $      \u2026      \n                                       \u2026      \n                                       \u2026      \n                                       \u2026      \n                                       \u2026      \n                                       \u2026      \n                                       \u2014      \n                                       \u2026      \n                                       \u2026      \n                                $      \u2026      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Disclosure is not comparative due to   \n       our adoption of CECL on January 1,     \n  (1)  2020.

Under the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau guidelines, we do\nnot commence the foreclosure process on real\nestate 1-4 family mortgage loans until after\nthe loan is 120 days delinquent. Foreclosure\nprocedures and timelines vary depending on\nwhether the property address resides in a\njudicial or non-judicial state. Judicial\nstates require the foreclosure to be processed\nthrough the state\u2019s courts while non-judicial\nstates are processed without court\nintervention. Foreclosure timelines vary\naccording to state law. In connection with our\nactions to support customers during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, we have suspended certain\nmortgage foreclosure activities. 97\nLOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE                         \nPAST DUE AND STILL                            \nACCRUING Certain loans                        \n90 days or more past                          \ndue are still accruing,                       \nbecause they are (1)                          \nwell-secured and in the                       \nprocess of collection                         \nor (2) real estate 1-4                        \nfamily mortgage loans                         \nor consumer loans                             \nexempt under regulatory                       \nrules from being                              \nclassified as                                 \nnonaccrual until later                        \ndelinquency, usually                          \n120 days past due.                            \nTable 6.14 shows loans                        \n90 days or more past                          \ndue and still accruing                        \nby class for loans not                        \ngovernment                                    \ninsured/guaranteed.                           \nTable 6.14: Loans 90\nDays or More Past Due\nand Still Accruing\n                                              \n  (in                                Dec\u00a031,  \n  millions)      Jun\u00a030, 2020           2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Total:      $         9,739          7,285  \n  Less: FHA                                   \n  insured/VA            8,922          6,352  \n  guaranteed                                  \n  (1)                                         \n  Total, not                                  \n  government  $           817            933  \n  insured/g\u2026                                  \n  By segment                                  \n  and class,                                  \n  not                                         \n  government                                  \n  insured/g\u2026                                  \n                                              \n  Commercia\u2026                                  \n  Commercial                                  \n  and         $           101             47  \n  industrial                                  \n  Real                                        \n  estate                   44             31  \n  mortgage                                    \n  Total                   145             78  \n  commercial                                  \n  Consumer:                                   \n  Real                                        \n  estate 1-4                                  \n  family                   93            112  \n  first                                       \n  mortgage                                    \n  Real                                        \n  estate 1-4                                  \n  family                   19             32  \n  junior                                      \n  lien                                        \n  mortgage                                    \n  Credit                  418            546  \n  card                                        \n  Automobile               54             78  \n  Other                                       \n  revolving                88             87  \n  credit and                                  \n  installme\u2026                                  \n  Total                   672            855  \n  consumer                                    \n  Total, not                                  \n  government  $           817            933  \n  insured/g\u2026                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents loans whose repayments      \n  (1)  arepredominantlyinsured by the FHA or  \n       guaranteed by the VA.                  \n                                              \n98 Note 6: Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses (continued) IMPAIRED LOANS In\nconnection with our adoption of CECL, we no\nlonger provide information on impaired loans.\nWe have retained impaired loans information\nfor the period ended December 31, 2019 . Table\n6.15 summarizes key information for impaired\nloans. Our impaired loans at December 31, 2019\n, predominantly included loans on nonaccrual\nstatus in the commercial portfolio segment and\nloans modified in a TDR, whether on accrual or\nnonaccrual status. Impaired loans generally\nhad estimated losses which are included in the\nallowance for credit losses. We did have\nimpaired loans with no allowance for credit\nlosses when the loss content has been\npreviously recognized through charge-offs,\nsuch as collateral dependent loans, or when\nloans are currently performing in accordance\nwith their terms and no loss has been\nestimated. Impaired loans excluded PCI loans\nand loans that had been fully charged off or\notherwise had zero recorded investment. Table\n6.15 included trial modifications that totaled\n$ 115million at December 31, 2019 .

RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs) When, for\neconomic or legal reasons related to a\nborrower\u2019s financial difficulties, we grant a\nconcession for other than an insignificant\nperiod of time to a borrower that we would not\notherwise consider, the related loan is\nclassified as a TDR, the balance of which\ntotaled $ 12.0billion and $ 11.8billion at\nJune 30, 2020 , and December 31, 2019 ,\nrespectively. We do not consider loan\nresolutions such as foreclosure or short sale\nto be a TDR. In addition, COVID-related\nmodifications are generally not classified as\nTDRs due to the relief under the CARES Act and\nthe Interagency Statement. For more\ninformation on the TDR relief, see Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).\nWe may require some consumer borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty to make\ntrial payments generally for a period of three\nto four months, according to the terms of a\nplanned permanent modification, to determine\nif they can perform according to those terms.\nThese arrangements represent trial\nmodifications, which we classify and account\nfor as TDRs. While loans are in trial payment\nprograms, their original terms are not\nconsidered modified and they continue to\nadvance through delinquency status and accrue\ninterest according to their original terms.\nCommitments to lend additional funds on loans\nwhose terms have been modified in a TDR\namounted to $ 442million and $ 500million at\nJune 30, 2020 , and December 31, 2019 ,\nrespectively. 100 Note 6: Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit Losses (continued) Table\n6.17 summarizes our TDR modifications for the\nperiods presented by primary modification type\nand includes the financial effects of these\nmodifications. For those loans that modify\nmore than once, the table reflects each\nmodification that occurred during the period.\nLoans that both modify and pay off within the\nperiod, as well as changes in recorded\ninvestment during the period for loans\nmodified in prior periods, are not included in\nthe table.\n\nTable 6.17: TDR Modifications\n                                              \n

We invest in\naffordable housing projects that qualify for\nthe LIHTC, which are designed to promote\nprivate development of low-income housing.\nThese investments generate a return mostly\nthrough realization of federal tax credit and\nother tax benefits. In the second quarter and\nfirst half of 2020 , we recognized pre-tax\nlosses of $ 340million and $ 679million ,\nrespectively, related to our LIHTC\ninvestments, compared with $ 298million and $\n571million , respectively, for the same\nperiods a year ago. These losses were\nrecognized in other noninterest income. We\nalso recognized total tax benefits of $\n401million and $ 799million in the second\nquarter and first half of 2020 , respectively,\nwhich included tax credits recorded to income\ntaxes of $ 317million and $ 631million for the\nsame periods, respectively. In the second\nquarter and first half of 2019 , total tax\nbenefits were $ 376million and $ 746million ,\nrespectively, which included tax credits of $\n303million and $ 605million for the same\nperiods, respectively. We are periodically\nrequired to provide additional financial\nsupport during the investment period. A\nliability is recognized for unfunded\ncommitments that are both legally binding and\nprobable of funding. These commitments are\npredominantly funded within three years of\ninitial investment. Our liability for these\nunfunded commitments was $ 4.2billion at June\n30, 2020 , and $ 4.3billion at December 31,\n2019 . This liability for unfunded commitments\nis included in long-term debt. OTHER The\nremaining portion of our nonmarketable equity\nsecurities portfolio consists of securities\naccounted for using the cost or measurement\nalternative.\n\n105 Realized Gains and Losses Not Held for\nTrading Table 8.2 provides a summary of the\nnet gains and losses from equity securities\nnot held for trading. Gains and losses for\nsecurities held for trading are reported in\nnet gains from trading activities.\n\nTable 8.2: Net Gains (Losses) from Equity\nSecurities Not Held for Trading\n

We\ninclude transactions where we were the sponsor\nor servicer and also have other significant\nforms of continuing involvement. Sponsorship\nincludes transactions where we solely or\nmaterially participated in the initial design\nor structuring of the VIE or marketed the\ntransaction to investors. We consider\ninvestments in securities, loans, guarantees,\nliquidity agreements, commitments and certain\nderivatives to be other forms of continuing\ninvolvement that may be significant. We also\ninclude transactions where we transferred\nassets to a VIE, account for the transfer as a\nsale, and service the VIE collateral or have\nother forms of continuing involvement that may\nbe significant (as described above). We\nexclude certain transactions with\nunconsolidated VIEs when our continuing\ninvolvement is temporary in nature or\ninsignificant in size. We also exclude secured\nborrowing transactions with unconsolidated\nVIEs (for information on these transactions,\nsee the Transactions with Consolidated VIEs\nand Secured Borrowings section in this

For VIEs that obtain\nexposure to assets synthetically through\nderivative instruments, the notional amount of\nthe derivative is included in the asset\nbalance. \u201cCarrying value\u201d is the amount in our\nconsolidated balance sheet related to our\ninvolvement with the unconsolidated VIEs.\n\u201cMaximum exposure to loss\u201d is determined as\nthe carrying value of our investment in the\nVIEs excluding the unconditional repurchase\noptions that have not been exercised, plus the\n109 remaining undrawn liquidity and lending\ncommitments, the notional amount of net\nwritten derivative contracts, and generally\nthe notional amount of, or stressed loss\nestimate for, other commitments and\nguarantees. It represents estimated loss that\nwould be incurred under severe, hypothetical\ncircumstances, for which we believe the\npossibility is extremely remote, such as where\nthe value of our interests and any associated\ncollateral declines to zero, without any\nconsideration of recovery or offset from any\neconomic hedges. Accordingly, this disclosure\nis not an indication of expected loss. For\ncomplete descriptions of our transactions with\nunconsolidated VIEs with which we have a\nsignificant continuing involvement, but we are\nnot the primary beneficiary, see Note 10\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities) in our 2019 Form 10-K. Loan Sales\nand Securitization Activity We periodically\ntransfer consumer and commercial loans and\nother types of financial assets in\nsecuritization and whole loan sale\ntransactions. We typically retain the\nservicing rights from these sales and may\ncontinue to hold other beneficial interests in\nthe transferred financial assets. We may also\nprovide liquidity to investors in the\nbeneficial interests and credit enhancements.\nThrough these transfers we may be exposed to\nliability under limited amounts of recourse as\nwell as standard representations and\nwarranties we make to purchasers and issuers.\nTable 10.3 presents information about\ntransfers of assets during the period to\nunconsolidated VIEs or third-party investors\nfor which we recorded the transfers as sales\nand have continuing involvement with the\ntransferred assets. In connection with these\ntransfers, we recorded servicing assets,\nsecurities, and a liability for repurchase\nlosses which reflects management\u2019s estimate of\nprobable losses related to various\nrepresentations and warranties for the loans\ntransferred. Each of these interests are\ninitially measured at fair value. Servicing\nrights are classified as Level 3 measurements,\nand generally securities are initially\nclassified as Level 2. Sales with continuing\ninvolvement include securitizations of\nconforming residential mortgages that are sold\nto the government-sponsored entities (GSEs) or\nGNMA. Substantially all transfers to these\nentities resulted in no gain or loss because\nthe loans were already measured at fair value\non a recurring basis.\nTable 10.3: Transfers With Continuing

portfolio\nof commercial MSRs, which are carried at the\nlower of cost or fair value (LOCOM), with a\nfair value of $ 1.4billion and $ 1.9billion at\nJune 30, 2020 , and December 31, 2019 ,\nrespectively. Prepayment assumptions do not\nsignificantly impact values of commercial MSRs\nand commercial mortgage 112 Note 10:\nSecuritizations and Variable Interest Entities\n( continued ) bonds as commercial loans\ngenerally include contractual restrictions on\nprepayment. Servicing costs are not a driver\nof our MSR value as we are typically primary\nor master servicer; the higher costs of\nservicing delinquent and foreclosed loans is\ngenerally borne by the special servicer. The\nprimary economic driver impacting the fair\nvalue of our commercial MSRs is forward\ninterest rates, which are derived from market\nobservable yield curves used to price capital\nmarkets instruments. Market interest rates\nsignificantly affect interest earned on\ncustodial deposit balances. The sensitivity of\nthe current fair value of our commercial MSRs\nto a hypothetical immediate adverse 25% change\nin the assumption about interest earned on\ndeposit balances at June 30, 2020 , and\nDecember 31, 2019 , would result in a decrease\nin fair value of $ 94million and $ 205million\n, respectively. See Note 11 (Mortgage Banking\nActivities) for further information on our\ncommercial MSRs. The sensitivities in the\npreceding paragraph and table are hypothetical\nand caution should be exercised when relying\non this data. Changes in value based on\nvariations in assumptions generally cannot be\nextrapolated because the relationship of the\nchange in the assumption to the change in\nvalue may not be linear. Also, the effect of a\nvariation in a particular assumption on the\nvalue of the other interests held is\ncalculated independently without changing any\nother assumptions. In reality, changes in one\nfactor may result in changes in others (for\nexample, changes in prepayment speed estimates\ncould result in changes in the credit losses),\nwhich might magnify or counteract the\nsensitivities. Off-Balance Sheet Loans Table\n10.7 presents information about the principal\nbalances of off-balance sheet loans that were\nsold or securitized, including residential\nmortgage loans sold to FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA and\nother investors, for which we have some form\nof continuing involvement (including\nservicer). Delinquent loans include loans 90\ndays or more past due and loans in bankruptcy,\nregardless of delinquency status. In\naccordance with applicable servicing\nguidelines, delinquency status continues to\nadvance for loans with COVID-related payment\ndeferrals. For loans sold or securitized where\nservicing is our only form of continuing\ninvolvement, we would only experience a loss\nif we were required to repurchase a delinquent\nloan or foreclosed asset due to a breach in\nrepresentations and warranties associated with\nour loan sale or servicing contracts.\n\nTable 10.7: Off-Balance Sheet Loans Sold or\nSecuritized\n                                              \n                                     N\u2026       \n                                     c\u2026       \n                       \u2026             (\u2026       \n        T\u2026             \u2026             S\u2026       \n        l\u2026             \u2026             m\u2026       \n        J\u2026    \u2026    J\u2026  \u2026    D\u2026       e\u2026       \n  \u2026     3\u2026    \u2026    3\u2026  \u2026    3\u2026       J\u2026       \n  \u2026     2\u2026    \u2026    2\u2026  \u2026    2\u2026    \u2026  3\u2026    \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026  $  1\u2026    \u2026    7\u2026       7\u2026    \u2026        \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026     1\u2026    \u2026    7\u2026       7\u2026    \u2026        \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026     9\u2026    \u2026    5\u2026       6\u2026    \u2026        \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026     11    \u2026     2        2    \u2014        \u2014  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026     9\u2026    \u2026    5\u2026       6\u2026    \u2026        \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026  $  1\u2026    \u2026    5\u2026       7\u2026    \u2026        \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Includes$319millionand$492millionof    \n       commercial foreclosed assets           \n  (1)  and$294millionand$356millionof         \n       consumer foreclosed assets atJune\u00a030,  \n       2020, andDecember\u00a031, 2019,            \n       respectively.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Net charge-offs exclude loans sold to  \n       FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA as we do not      \n  (2)  service or manage the underlying real  \n       estate upon foreclosure and, as such,  \n       do not have access to net charge-off   \n       information.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       AtJune\u00a030, 2020, andDecember\u00a031,       \n       2019, the table includes total         \n       loansof$1.0trillionat both dates,      \n       delinquent loans                       \n  (3)  of$51.3billionand$5.2billion,          \n       respectively, and foreclosed assets    \n       of$224millionand$251million,           \n       respectively, for FNMA, FHLMC and      \n       GNMA.                                  \n                                              \n113 Transactions with Consolidated VIEs and\nSecured Borrowings Table 10.8 presents a\nsummary of financial assets and liabilities\nfor asset transfers accounted for as secured\nborrowings and involvements with consolidated\nVIEs.

                    \nWe have raised financing through the\nsecuritization of certain financial assets in\ntransactions with VIEs accounted for as\nsecured borrowings. We also consolidate VIEs\nwhere we are the primary beneficiary. In\ncertain transactions, we provide contractual\nsupport in the form of limited recourse and\nliquidity to facilitate the remarketing of\nshort-term securities issued to third-party\ninvestors. Other than this limited contractual\nsupport, the assets of the VIEs are the sole\nsource of repayment of the securities held by\nthird parties. For complete descriptions of\nour accounting for transfers accounted for as\nsecured borrowings and involvement with\nconsolidated VIEs, see Note 10\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities) in our 2019 Form 10-K. Other\nTransactions In addition to the transactions\nincluded in the previous tables, we have used\nwholly-owned trust preferred security VIEs to\nissue debt securities or preferred equity\nexclusively to third-party investors. As the\nsole assets of the VIEs are receivables from\nus, we do not consolidate the VIEs even though\nwe own all of the voting equity shares of the\nVIEs, have fully guaranteed the obligations of\nthe VIEs, and may have the right to redeem the\nthird-party securities under certain\ncircumstances. In our consolidated balance\nsheet we reported the debt securities issued\nto the VIEs as long-term junior subordinated\ndebt with a carrying value of $ 692million and\n$ 2.1billion at June 30, 2020 , and December\n31, 2019 , respectively. During first quarter\n2020, we liquidated certain of our trust\npreferred security VIEs. As part of these\nliquidations, the preferred securities issued\nby the trusts were canceled and junior\nsubordinated debentures with a total carrying\nvalue of $ 1.4billion were distributed to the\npreferred security holders. Prior to the\nliquidations, we held $ 10million of these\npreferred securities, which were exchanged for\njunior subordinated debentures upon\nliquidation and subsequently retired with no\nimpact to earnings. See Note 17 (Preferred\nStock) for additional information about trust\npreferred securities. Certain money market\nfunds are also excluded from the previous\ntables because they are exempt from the\nconsolidation analysis. We voluntarily waived\na portion of our management fees for these\nmoney market funds to maintain a minimum level\nof daily net investment income. The amount of\nfees waived was $ 22million and $ 33million in\nthe second quarter and first half of 2020 ,\nrespectively, compared with $ 10million and $\n20million for the same periods a year ago. 114\nNote 11: Mortgage Banking Activities (\ncontinued )\n                                         \n  Note 11:  Mortgage Banking Activities  \n                                         \nMortgage banking activities consist of\nresidential and commercial mortgage\noriginations, sales and servicing.

The credit risk related to these\nadvances is limited since the reimbursement is\ngenerally senior to cash payments to\ninvestors. We also advance payments of taxes\nand insurance for our owned loans which are\ncollectible from the borrower. We maintain an\nallowance for uncollectible amounts for\nadvances on loans serviced for others that may\nnot be reimbursed if the payments were not\nmade in accordance with applicable servicing\nagreements or if the insurance or servicing\nagreements contain limitations on\nreimbursements. Servicing advances on owned\nloans are charged-off when deemed\nuncollectible.

Maximum exposure\nto loss estimates in Table 13.1 do not reflect\neconomic hedges or collateral we could use to\noffset or recover losses we may incur under\nour guarantee agreements. Accordingly, this\nrequired disclosure is not an indication of\nexpected loss. We believe the carrying value\nis more representative of our exposure to loss\nthan maximum exposure to loss. The carrying\nvalue represents the fair value of the\nguarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL\nfor guarantees, if applicable. Non-investment\ngrade represents those guarantees on which we\nhave a higher risk of performance under the\nterms of the guarantee. If the underlying\nassets under the guarantee are non-investment\ngrade (that is, an external rating that is\nbelow investment grade or an internal credit\ndefault grade that is equivalent to a below\ninvestment grade external rating), we consider\nthe risk of performance to be high. Internal\ncredit default grades are determined based\nupon the same credit policies that we use to\nevaluate the risk of payment or performance\nwhen making loans and other extensions of\ncredit. Credit quality indicators we usually\nconsider in evaluating risk of payments or\nperformance are described in Note 6 (Loans and\nRelated Allowance for Credit Losses). We\nprovide debit and credit card transaction\nprocessing services through the payment\nnetworks directly for merchants and as a\nsponsor for merchant processing servicers,\nincluding our joint venture with a third party\nthat is accounted for as an equity method\ninvestment. In our role as the merchant\nacquiring bank, we have a potential obligation\nfor payment and delivery disputes between the\nmerchant and the cardholder that are resolved\nin favor of the cardholder. If we are unable\nto collect the amounts from the merchant, we\nincur a loss for the refund to the cardholder.\nWe are secondarily obligated to make a refund\nfor transactions involving the sponsored\nmerchant processing servicers. We have a low\nlikelihood of loss since most products and\nservices are delivered when purchased and\namounts are refunded when items are returned\nto the merchant. In addition, we may reduce\nour risk by withholding future payments and\nrequiring cash or other collateral. For the\nfirst half of 2020 , we processed card\ntransaction volume of $ 608.3billion as a\nmerchant acquiring bank, and related losses,\nincluding those from our joint venture entity,\nwere immaterial. The Parent fully and\nunconditionally guarantees the payment of\nprincipal, interest, and any other amounts\nthat may be due on securities that its 100%\nowned finance subsidiary, Wells Fargo Finance\nLLC, may issue. These guaranteed liabilities\nwere $ 2.4billion and $ 1.6billion at June 30,\n2020 and December 31, 118 Note 13: Guarantees,\nPledged Assets and Collateral, and Other\nCommitments ( continued ) 2019 , respectively.\nThese guarantees rank on parity with all of\nthe Parent\u2019s other unsecured and\nunsubordinated indebtedness. Pledged Assets\nTable 13.2 provides the carrying amount of on-\nbalance sheet pledged assets and the fair\nvalue of other pledged collateral. Other\npledged collateral is collateral we have\nreceived from third parties, have the right to\nrepledge and is not recognized on our balance\nsheet. TRADING RELATED ACTIVITY Our trading\nbusinesses may pledge debt and equity\nsecurities in connection with securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase (repurchase\nagreements) and securities lending\narrangements. The collateral that we pledge\nrelated to our trading activities may include\nour own collateral as well as collateral that\nwe have received from third parties and have\nthe right to repledge. All of the trading\nactivity pledged collateral is eligible to be\nrepledged or sold by the secured party. NON-\nTRADING RELATED ACTIVITY As part of our\nliquidity management strategy, we may pledge\nloans, debt securities, and other assets to\nsecure trust and public deposits, borrowings\nand letters of credit from the Federal Home\nLoan Bank (FHLB) and FRB and for other\npurposes as required or permitted by law or\ninsurance statutory requirements.\nSubstantially all of the non-trading activity\npledged collateral is not eligible to be\nrepledged or sold by the secured party. VIE\nRELATED We pledge assets in connection with\nvarious types of transactions entered into\nwith VIEs. These pledged assets can only be\nused to settle the liabilities of those\nentities. We also have loans recorded on our\nbalance sheet which represent certain\ndelinquent loans that are eligible for\nrepurchase from GNMA loan securitizations. See\nNote 10 (Securitizations and Variable Interest\nEntities) for additional information on\nconsolidated VIE assets and VIEs accounted for\nas secured borrowings.\n\nTable 13.2: Pledged Assets\n                                              \n  (in                                         \n  millions)                                   \n  Related to                                  \n  trading                                     \n  activities:     Jun\u00a030,2020    Dec\u00a031,2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Repledged                                   \n  third-party                                 \n  owned debt   $       41,952         60,083  \n  and                                         \n  equity                                      \n  securities                                  \n  Trading                                     \n  debt                 22,847         51,083  \n  securities                                  \n  and other                                   \n  Equity                  971          1,379  \n  securities                                  \n  Total                                       \n  pledged                                     \n  assets               65,770        112,545  \n  related to                                  \n  trading                                     \n  activities                                  \n  Related to                                  \n  non-trading                                 \n  activities:                                 \n  Loans               406,496        406,106  \n  Debt                                        \n  securities:                                 \n  Available-\u2026          54,455         61,126  \n  Held-to-ma\u2026           2,826          3,685  \n  Mortgage                                    \n  loans held              181          2,266  \n  for sale                                    \n  Total                                       \n  pledged                                     \n  assets              463,958        473,183  \n  related to                                  \n  non-trading                                 \n  activities                                  \n  Related to                                  \n  VIEs:                                       \n  Consolidat\u2026          12,447         14,368  \n  VIE assets                                  \n  VIEs                                        \n  accounted                                   \n  for as                   74             80  \n  secured                                     \n  borrowings                                  \n  Loans                                       \n  eligible                                    \n  for                      54            568  \n  repurchase                                  \n  from GNMA                                   \n  securitiza\u2026                                 \n  Total                                       \n  pledged                                     \n  assets               12,575         15,016  \n  related to                                  \n  VIEs                                        \n  Total                                       \n  pledged      $      542,303        600,744  \n  assets                                      \n                                              \nSecurities Financing Activities We enter into\nresale and repurchase agreements and\nsecurities borrowing and lending agreements\n(collectively, \u201csecurities financing\nactivities\u201d) typically to finance trading\npositions (including securities and\nderivatives), acquire securities to cover\nshort trading positions, accommodate\ncustomers\u2019 financing needs, and settle other\nsecurities obligations. These activities are\nconducted through our broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries and to a lesser extent through\nother bank entities. Our securities financing\nactivities primarily involve high quality,\nliquid securities such as U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and government agency securities,\nand to a lesser extent, less liquid\nsecurities, including equity securities,\ncorporate bonds and asset-backed securities.\nWe account for these transactions as\ncollateralized financings in which we\ntypically receive or pledge securities as\ncollateral. We believe these financing\ntransactions generally do not have material\ncredit risk given the collateral provided and\nthe related monitoring processes. OFFSETTING\nOF SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES Table 13.3\npresents resale and repurchase agreements\nsubject to master repurchase agreements (MRA)\nand securities borrowing and lending\nagreements subject to master securities\nlending agreements (MSLA). Collateralized\nfinancings with a single counterparty are\npresented net on our balance sheet, provided\ncertain criteria are met that permit balance\nsheet netting. Most transactions subject to\nthese agreements do not meet those criteria\nand thus are not eligible for balance sheet\nnetting. Collateral we pledged consists of\nnon-cash instruments, such as securities or\nloans, and is not netted on the balance sheet\nagainst the related liability. Collateral we\nreceived includes securities or loans and is\nnot recognized on our balance sheet.\nCollateral pledged or received may be\nincreased or decreased over time to maintain\ncertain contractual thresholds, as the assets\nunderlying each arrangement fluctuate in\nvalue. Generally, these agreements require\ncollateral to exceed the asset or liability\nrecognized on the balance sheet. The following\ntable includes the amount of collateral\npledged or received related to exposures\nsubject to enforceable MRAs or MSLAs. While\nthese agreements 119 are typically over-\ncollateralized, U.S. GAAP requires disclosure\nin this table to limit the reported amount of\nsuch collateral to the amount of the related\nrecognized asset or liability for each\ncounterparty. In addition to the amounts\nincluded in Table 13.3 , we also have balance\nsheet netting related to derivatives that is\ndisclosed in Note 15 (Derivatives).\n\nTable 13.3: Offsetting \u2013 Securities Financing\nActivities\n                                              \n  (in                                         \n  million\u2026                                    \n  Assets:                                     \n  Resale                                      \n  and                                         \n  securit\u2026                                    \n  borrowi\u2026           Jun              Dec     \n  agreeme\u2026       30,2020          31,2019     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Gross                                       \n  amounts   $    110,900          140,773     \n  recogni\u2026                                    \n  Gross                                       \n  amounts                                     \n  offset                                      \n  in             (13,640  )       (19,180  )  \n  consoli\u2026                                    \n  balance                                     \n  sheet                                       \n  (1)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amounts                                     \n  in                                          \n  consoli\u2026        97,260          121,593     \n  balance                                     \n  sheet                                       \n  (2)                                         \n  Collate\u2026                                    \n  not                                         \n  recogni\u2026                                    \n  in             (96,541  )      (120,786  )  \n  consoli\u2026                                    \n  balance                                     \n  sheet                                       \n  (3)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amount    $        719              807     \n  (4)                                         \n  Liabili\u2026                                    \n  Repurch\u2026                                    \n  and                                         \n  securit\u2026                                    \n  lending                                     \n  agreeme\u2026                                    \n  Gross                                       \n  amounts   $     63,028          111,038     \n  recogni\u2026                                    \n  Gross                                       \n  amounts                                     \n  offset                                      \n  in             (13,640  )       (19,180  )  \n  consoli\u2026                                    \n  balance                                     \n  sheet                                       \n  (1)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amounts                                     \n  in                                          \n  consoli\u2026        49,388           91,858     \n  balance                                     \n  sheet                                       \n  (5)                                         \n  Collate\u2026                                    \n  pledged                                     \n  but not                                     \n  netted                                      \n  in             (49,147  )       (91,709  )  \n  consoli\u2026                                    \n  balance                                     \n  sheet                                       \n  (6)                                         \n  Net                                         \n  amount    $        241              149     \n  (4)                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents recognized amount of        \n       resale and repurchase agreements with  \n  (1)  counterparties subject to enforceable  \n       MRAs that have been offset in the      \n       consolidated balance sheet.            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Includes$79.3billionand$102.1billion\u2026  \n       on our consolidated balance sheet in   \n       federal funds sold and securities      \n       purchased under resale agreements      \n       atJune\u00a030, 2020, andDecember\u00a031,       \n  (2)  2019, respectively.

In these transactions, we receive\ncash in exchange for transferring securities\nas collateral and recognize an obligation to\nreacquire the securities for cash at the\ntransaction\u2019s maturity. These types of\ntransactions create risks, including (1) the\ncounterparty may fail to return the securities\nat maturity, (2) the fair value of the\nsecurities transferred may decline below the\namount of our obligation to reacquire the\nsecurities, and therefore create an obligation\nfor us to pledge additional amounts, and (3)\nthe counterparty may accelerate the maturity\non demand, requiring us to reacquire the\nsecurity prior to contractual maturity. We\nattempt to mitigate these risks in various\nways. Our collateral primarily consists of\nhighly liquid securities. In addition, we\nunderwrite and monitor the financial strength\nof our counterparties, monitor the fair value\nof collateral pledged relative to\ncontractually required repurchase amounts, and\nmonitor that our collateral is properly\nreturned through the clearing and settlement\nprocess in advance of our cash repayment.\nTable 13.4 provides the gross amounts\nrecognized on the balance sheet (before the\neffects of offsetting) of our liabilities for\nrepurchase and securities lending agreements\ndisaggregated by underlying collateral type.\n120 Note 13: Guarantees, Pledged Assets and\nCollateral, and Other Commitments ( continued\n)\nTable 13.4: Gross Obligations by Underlying   \nCollateral Type                               \n                                              \n  (in                                         \n  millions)                                   \n  Repurchase                             Dec  \n  agreement\u2026       Jun\u00a030,2020       31,2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Securities                                  \n  of U.S.                                     \n  Treasury      $       33,757        48,161  \n  and                                         \n  federal                                     \n  agencies                                    \n  Securities                                  \n  of U.S.                                     \n  States and                54           104  \n  political                                   \n  subdivisi\u2026                                  \n  Federal                                     \n  agency                 9,751        44,737  \n  mortgage-\u2026                                  \n  securities                                  \n  Non-agency                                  \n  mortgage-\u2026             1,103         1,818  \n  securities                                  \n  Corporate                                   \n  debt                   9,273         7,126  \n  securities                                  \n  Asset-bac\u2026             1,008         1,844  \n  securities                                  \n  Equity                 1,399         1,674  \n  securities                                  \n  Other                    363           705  \n  Total                 56,708       106,169  \n  repurchas\u2026                                  \n  Securities                                  \n  lending                                     \n  arrangeme\u2026                                  \n  Securities                                  \n  of U.S.                                     \n  Treasury                  38           163  \n  and                                         \n  federal                                     \n  agencies                                    \n  Federal                                     \n  agency                    18             \u2014  \n  mortgage-\u2026                                  \n  securities                                  \n  Corporate                                   \n  debt                      97           223  \n  securities                                  \n  Equity                                      \n  securities             6,164         4,481  \n  (1)                                         \n  Other                      3             2  \n  Total                                       \n  securities             6,320         4,869  \n  lending                                     \n  Total                                       \n  repurchas\u2026                                  \n  and           $       63,028       111,038  \n  securities                                  \n  lending                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Equity securities are generally        \n       exchange traded and represent          \n       collateral received from third         \n       parties that has been repledged.

As part of\nmaintaining our memberships in certain\nclearing organizations, we are required to\nstand ready to provide liquidity to sustain\nmarket clearing activity in the event\nunforeseen events occur or are deemed likely\nto occur. Certain of these obligations are\nguarantees of other members\u2019 performance and\naccordingly are included in Other guarantees\nand indemnifications in Table 13.1 . Also, we\nhave commitments to purchase loans and\nsecurities under resale agreements from\ncertain counterparties, including central\nclearing organizations. The amount of our\nunfunded contractual commitments was $\n14.1billion and $ 7.5billion as of June 30,\n2020 , and December 31, 2019 , respectively.\nGiven the nature of these commitments, they\nare excluded from Table 6.4 (Unfunded Credit\nCommitments) in Note 6 (Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit Losses). 121\n                           \n  Note 14:  Legal Actions  \n                           \nWells Fargo and certain of our subsidiaries\nare involved in a number of judicial,\nregulatory, governmental, arbitration, and\nother proceedings or investigations concerning\nmatters arising from the conduct of our\nbusiness activities, and many of those\nproceedings and investigations expose Wells\nFargo to potential financial loss. These\nproceedings and investigations include actions\nbrought against Wells Fargo and/or our\nsubsidiaries with respect to corporate-related\nmatters and transactions in which Wells Fargo\nand/or our subsidiaries were involved. In\naddition, Wells Fargo and our subsidiaries may\nbe requested to provide information or\notherwise cooperate with government\nauthorities in the conduct of investigations\nof other persons or industry groups. Although\nthere can be no assurance as to the ultimate\noutcome, Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries\nhave generally denied, or believe we have a\nmeritorious defense and will deny, liability\nin all significant legal actions pending\nagainst us, including the matters described\nbelow, and we intend to defend vigorously each\ncase, other than matters we describe as having\nsettled. We establish accruals for legal\nactions when potential losses associated with\nthe actions become probable and the costs can\nbe reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we\nrecord the amount we consider to be the best\nestimate within a range of potential losses\nthat are both probable and estimable; however,\nif we cannot determine a best estimate, then\nwe record the low end of the range of those\npotential losses. The actual costs of\nresolving legal actions may be substantially\nhigher or lower than the amounts accrued for\nthose actions. ATM ACCESS FEE LITIGATION In\nOctober 2011, plaintiffs filed a putative\nclass action, Mackmin, et al. v. Visa, Inc. et\nal. , against Wells Fargo & Company, Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A., Visa, MasterCard, and\nseveral other banks in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia.\nPlaintiffs allege that the Visa and MasterCard\nrequirement that if an ATM operator charges an\naccess fee on Visa and MasterCard\ntransactions, then that fee cannot be greater\nthan the access fee charged for transactions\non other networks, violates antitrust rules.\nPlaintiffs seek treble damages, restitution,\ninjunctive relief, and attorneys\u2019 fees where\navailable under federal and state law. Two\nother antitrust cases that make similar\nallegations were filed in the same court, but\nthese cases did not name Wells Fargo as a\ndefendant. On February 13, 2013, the district\ncourt granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss\nthe three actions. Plaintiffs appealed the\ndismissals and, on August 4, 2015, the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia Circuit vacated the district court\u2019s\ndecisions and remanded the three cases to the\ndistrict court for further proceedings. On\nJune 28, 2016, the United States Supreme Court\ngranted defendants\u2019 petitions for writ of\ncertiorari to review the decisions of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the\nDistrict of Columbia. On November 17, 2016,\nthe United States Supreme Court dismissed the\npetitions as improvidently granted, and the\nthree cases returned to the district court for\nfurther proceedings. On March 18, 2020 , the\nCompany reached a settlement in principle\npursuant to which the Company will pay $\n20.8million to resolve the cases, subject to\nfinal documentation of the settlement\nagreement. AUTOMOBILE LENDING MATTERS On April\n20, 2018, the Company entered into consent\norders with the Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (OCC) and the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (CFPB) to resolve, among\nother things, investigations by the agencies\ninto the Company\u2019s compliance risk management\nprogram and its past practices involving\ncertain automobile collateral protection\ninsurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage\ninterest rate lock extensions. The consent\norders require remediation to customers and\nthe payment of a total of $ 1.0billion in\ncivil money penalties to the agencies. In July\n2017, the Company announced a plan to\nremediate customers who may have been\nfinancially harmed due to issues related to\nautomobile CPI policies purchased through a\nthird-party vendor on their behalf. Multiple\nputative class action cases alleging, among\nother things, unfair and deceptive practices\nrelating to these CPI policies, have been\nfiled against the Company and consolidated\ninto one multi-district litigation in the\nUnited States District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California. The Company has\nreached an agreement to resolve the multi-\ndistrict litigation pursuant to which the\nCompany has agreed to pay, consistent with its\nremediation obligations under the consent\norders, approximately $ 609million in\nremediation to customers with CPI policies\nplaced between October 15, 2005, and September\n30, 2016. The settlement amount is not\nincremental to the Company\u2019s remediation\nobligations under the consent orders, but\ninstead encompasses those obligations,\nincluding remediation payments to date. The\nsettlement amount is subject to change as the\nCompany finalizes its remediation activity\nunder the consent orders. In addition, the\nCompany has agreed to contribute $ 1million to\na common fund for the class. The district\ncourt granted final approval of the settlement\non November 21, 2019. A putative class of\nshareholders also filed a securities fraud\nclass action against the Company and its\nexecutive officers alleging material\nmisstatements and omissions of CPI-related\ninformation in the Company\u2019s public\ndisclosures. In January 2020, the court\ndismissed this action as to all defendants\nexcept the Company and a former executive\nofficer and limited the action to two alleged\nmisstatements. In addition, the Company is\nsubject to a class action lawsuit in the\nUnited States District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California alleging that customers\nare entitled to refunds related to the unused\nportion of guaranteed automobile protection\n(GAP) waiver or insurance agreements between\nthe customer and dealer and, by assignment,\nthe lender. Allegations related to the CPI and\nGAP programs are among the subjects of\nshareholder derivative lawsuits pending in\nfederal and state court in California. The\ncourt dismissed the state court action in\nSeptember 2018, but plaintiffs filed an\namended complaint in November 2018. The\nparties to the state court action have entered\ninto an agreement to resolve the action\npursuant to which the Company will pay\nplaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and undertake\ncertain business and governance practices. The\nstate court granted final approval of the\nsettlement on January 15, 2020, and a notice\nof appeal has been filed. These and other\nissues related to the origination, servicing,\nand collection of consumer automobile loans,\nincluding related insurance products, have\nalso subjected the Company to formal or\ninformal inquiries, investigations, or\nexaminations from federal and state government\nagencies. In December 2018, the Company\nentered into an agreement with all 50 state\nAttorneys General and the District of Columbia\nto resolve an investigation into the Company\u2019s\nretail sales practices, CPI and GAP, and\nmortgage interest rate lock matters, pursuant\nto which the Company paid $ 575million .\nCONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION Wells\nFargo shareholders have brought securities\nfraud class actions in the 122 Note 14: Legal\nActions ( continued ) United States District\nCourts for the Northern District of California\nand the Southern District of New York alleging\nthat the Company made false or misleading\nstatements regarding its efforts to comply\nwith the February 2018 consent order with the\nFRB and the April 2018 consent orders with the\nCFPB and OCC. CONSUMER DEPOSIT ACCOUNT RELATED\nREGULATORY INVESTIGATION The CFPB is\nconducting an investigation into whether\ncustomers were unduly harmed by the Company\u2019s\nhistorical practices associated with the\nfreezing (and, in many cases, closing) of\nconsumer deposit accounts after the Company\ndetected suspected fraudulent activity (by\nthird parties or account holders) that\naffected those accounts. CORONAVIRUS AID,\nRELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT/PAYCHECK\nPROTECTION PROGRAM Plaintiffs have filed\nputative class actions in various federal\ncourts against the Company. The actions seek\ndamages and injunctive relief related to the\nCompany\u2019s offering of Paycheck Protection\nProgram (PPP) loans under the Coronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic Security Act, as well as\nclaims for fees by purported agents who\nallegedly assisted customers with preparing\nPPP loan applications submitted to the\nCompany. The Company has also received formal\nand informal inquiries from federal and state\ngovernmental agencies regarding its offering\nof PPP loans. FIDUCIARY AND CUSTODY ACCOUNT\nFEE CALCULATIONS Federal government agencies\nare conducting formal or informal inquiries,\ninvestigations, or examinations regarding fee\ncalculations within certain fiduciary and\ncustody accounts in the Company\u2019s investment\nand fiduciary services business, which is part\nof the wealth management business within the\nWealth and Investment Management (WIM)\noperating segment. The Company has determined\nthat there have been instances of incorrect\nfees being applied to certain assets and\naccounts, resulting in both overcharges and\nundercharges to customers. FOREIGN EXCHANGE\nBUSINESS The United States Department of\nJustice (Department of Justice) is\ninvestigating certain activities in the\nCompany\u2019s foreign exchange business, including\nwhether customers may have received pricing\ninconsistent with commitments made to those\ncustomers. Previous investigations by other\nfederal government agencies have been\nresolved. INTERCHANGE LITIGATION Plaintiffs\nrepresenting a putative class of merchants\nhave filed putative class actions, and\nindividual merchants have filed individual\nactions, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells\nFargo & Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and\nWachovia Corporation regarding the interchange\nfees associated with Visa and MasterCard\npayment card transactions. Visa, MasterCard,\nand several other banks and bank holding\ncompanies are also named as defendants in\nthese actions. These actions have been\nconsolidated in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of New York.\nThe amended and consolidated complaint asserts\nclaims against defendants based on alleged\nviolations of federal and state antitrust laws\nand seeks damages, as well as injunctive\nrelief. Plaintiff merchants allege that Visa,\nMasterCard, and payment card issuing banks\nunlawfully colluded to set interchange rates.\nPlaintiffs also allege that enforcement of\ncertain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged\ntying and bundling of services offered to\nmerchants are anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and\nWachovia, along with other defendants and\nentities, are parties to Loss and Judgment\nSharing Agreements, which provide that they,\nalong with other entities, will share, based\non a formula, in any losses from the\nInterchange Litigation. On July 13, 2012,\nVisa, MasterCard, and the financial\ninstitution defendants, including Wells Fargo,\nsigned a memorandum of understanding with\nplaintiff merchants to resolve the\nconsolidated class action and reached a\nseparate settlement in principle of the\nconsolidated individual actions. The\nsettlement payments to be made by all\ndefendants in the consolidated class and\nindividual actions totaled approximately $\n6.6billion before reductions applicable to\ncertain merchants opting out of the\nsettlement. The class settlement also provided\nfor the distribution to class merchants of 10\nbasis points of default interchange across all\ncredit rate categories for a period of eight\nconsecutive months. The district court granted\nfinal approval of the settlement, which was\nappealed to the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit by settlement objector\nmerchants. Other merchants opted out of the\nsettlement and are pursuing several individual\nactions. On June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit\nvacated the settlement agreement and reversed\nand remanded the consolidated action to the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York for further proceedings.\nOn November 23, 2016, prior class counsel\nfiled a petition to the United States Supreme\nCourt, seeking review of the reversal of the\nsettlement by the Second Circuit, and the\nSupreme Court denied the petition on March 27,\n2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court\nappointed lead class counsel for a damages\nclass and an equitable relief class. The\nparties have entered into a settlement\nagreement to resolve the money damages class\nclaims pursuant to which defendants will pay a\ntotal of approximately $ 6.2billion , which\nincludes approximately $ 5.3billion of funds\nremaining from the 2012 settlement and $\n900million in additional funding. The\nCompany\u2019s allocated responsibility for the\nadditional funding is approximately $\n94.5million . The court granted final approval\nof the settlement on December 13, 2019, which\nwas appealed to the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit by settlement\nobjector merchants. Several of the opt-out and\ndirect action litigations have been settled\nwhile others remain pending. Discovery is\nproceeding in the opt-out litigations and the\nequitable relief class case. LOW INCOME\nHOUSING TAX CREDITS Federal government\nagencies have undertaken formal or informal\ninquiries or investigations regarding the\nmanner in which the Company purchased, and\nnegotiated the purchase of, certain federal\nlow income housing tax credits in connection\nwith the financing of low income housing\ndevelopments. MOBILE DEPOSIT PATENT LITIGATION\nThe Company is a defendant in two separate\ncases brought by United Services Automobile\nAssociation (USAA) in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of\nTexas alleging claims of patent infringement\nregarding mobile deposit capture technology\npatents held by USAA. Trial in the first case\ncommenced on October 30, 2019, and resulted in\na $ 200million verdict against the Company.\nTrial in the second case commenced on January\n6, 2020, and resulted in a $ 102.7million\nverdict against the Company. The Company has\nfiled post-trial motions to, among other\nthings, vacate the verdicts, and USAA has\nfiled post-trial motions seeking future\nroyalty payments and damages for willful\ninfringement. MORTGAGE LOAN MODIFICATION\nLITIGATION Plaintiffs representing a putative\nclass of mortgage borrowers have filed\nseparate putative class actions, Hernandez v.\nWells Fargo, et al. , Coordes v. Wells Fargo,\net al. , Ryder v. Wells Fargo , Liguori v.\nWells Fargo , and Dore v. Wells Fargo ,\nagainst Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern\nDistrict 123 of California, the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Washington,\nthe United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of Ohio, the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of\nNew York, and the United States District Court\nfor the Western District of Pennsylvania,\nrespectively. Plaintiffs allege that Wells\nFargo improperly denied mortgage loan\nmodifications or repayment plans to customers\nin the foreclosure process due to the\noverstatement of foreclosure attorneys\u2019 fees\nthat were included for purposes of determining\nwhether a customer in the foreclosure process\nqualified for a mortgage loan modification or\nrepayment plan. The district court in the\nHernandez case certified a nationwide breach\nof contract class for foreclosed borrowers and\ndenied certification on claims pertaining to\nother impacted borrowers. In March 2020, the\nCompany entered into an agreement pursuant to\nwhich the Company will pay $ 18.5million to\nresolve the claims of the certified class in\nthe Hernandez case. MORTGAGE-RELATED\nREGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS Federal and state\ngovernment agencies, including the Department\nof Justice, have been investigating or\nexamining certain mortgage related activities\nof Wells Fargo and predecessor institutions.\nWells Fargo, for itself and for predecessor\ninstitutions, has responded, or continues to\nrespond, to requests from these agencies\nseeking information regarding the origination,\nunderwriting, and securitization of\nresidential mortgages, including sub-prime\nmortgages. These agencies have advanced\ntheories of purported liability with respect\nto certain of these activities. An agreement,\npursuant to which the Company paid $\n2.09billion , was reached in August 2018 to\nresolve the Department of Justice\ninvestigation, which related to certain\n2005-2007 residential mortgage-backed\nsecurities activities. In addition, the\nCompany reached an agreement with the Attorney\nGeneral of the State of Illinois in November\n2018 pursuant to which the Company paid $\n17million in restitution to certain Illinois\nstate pension funds and reached an agreement\nwith the Attorney General of the State of\nMaryland in June 2020 pursuant to which the\nCompany agreed to pay $ 20million in\nrestitution, in each case to resolve claims\nrelating to certain residential mortgage-\nbacked securities activities. Other financial\ninstitutions have entered into similar\nsettlements with these agencies, the nature of\nwhich related to the specific activities of\nthose financial institutions, including the\nimposition of significant financial penalties\nand remedial actions. NOMURA/NATIXIS MORTGAGE-\nRELATED LITIGATION In August 2014 and August\n2015, Nomura Credit & Capital Inc. (Nomura)\nand Natixis Real Estate Holdings, LLC\n(Natixis) filed a total of seven third-party\ncomplaints against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in\nNew York state court. In the underlying first-\nparty actions, Nomura and Natixis have been\nsued for alleged breaches of representations\nand warranties made in connection with\nresidential mortgage-backed securities\nsponsored by them. In the third-party actions,\nNomura and Natixis allege that Wells Fargo, as\nmaster servicer, primary servicer or\nsecurities administrator, failed to notify\nNomura and Natixis of their own breaches,\nfailed to properly oversee the primary\nservicers, and failed to adhere to accepted\nservicing practices. Natixis additionally\nalleges that Wells Fargo failed to perform\ndefault oversight duties. Wells Fargo has\nasserted counterclaims alleging that Nomura\nand Natixis failed to provide Wells Fargo\nnotice of their representation and warranty\nbreaches. OFAC RELATED INVESTIGATION The\nCompany has self-identified an issue whereby\ncertain foreign banks utilized a Wells Fargo\nsoftware-based solution to conduct\nimport/export trade-related financing\ntransactions with countries and entities\nprohibited by the Office of Foreign Assets\nControl (OFAC) of the United States Department\nof the Treasury. We do not believe any funds\nrelated to these transactions flowed through\naccounts at Wells Fargo as a result of the\naforementioned conduct. The Company has made\nvoluntary self-disclosures to OFAC and is\ncooperating with an inquiry from the\nDepartment of Justice. ORDER OF POSTING\nLITIGATION Plaintiffs filed a series of\nputative class actions against Wachovia Bank,\nN.A., and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as well as\nmany other banks, challenging the \u201chigh to\nlow\u201d order in which the banks post debit card\ntransactions to consumer deposit accounts.\nMost of these actions were consolidated in\nmulti-district litigation proceedings (MDL\nproceedings) in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of Florida.\nThe court in the MDL proceedings has certified\na class of putative plaintiffs, and Wells\nFargo moved to compel arbitration of the\nclaims of unnamed class members. The court\ndenied the motions to compel arbitration in\nOctober 2016, and Wells Fargo appealed this\ndecision to the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Eleventh Circuit. In May 2018, the\nEleventh Circuit ruled in Wells Fargo\u2019s favor\nand found that Wells Fargo had not waived its\narbitration rights and remanded the case to\nthe district court for further proceedings. On\nSeptember 26, 2019, the district court entered\nan order granting Wells Fargo\u2019s motion and\ndismissed the claims of unnamed class members\nin favor of arbitration. Plaintiffs appealed\nthis decision to the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit. RETAIL SALES\nPRACTICES MATTERS A number of bodies or\nentities, including (a) federal, state, and\nlocal government agencies, including the\nDepartment of Justice, the United States\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and\nthe United States Department of Labor, (b)\nstate attorneys general, including the New\nYork Attorney General, and (c) Congressional\ncommittees, have undertaken formal or informal\ninquiries, investigations, or examinations\narising out of certain retail sales practices\nof the Company that were the subject of\nsettlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the\nOffice of the Los Angeles City Attorney\nannounced by the Company on September 8, 2016.\nThese matters are at varying stages. The\nCompany has responded, and continues to\nrespond, to requests from certain of the\nforegoing. In October 2018, the Company\nentered into an agreement to resolve the New\nYork Attorney General\u2019s investigation pursuant\nto which the Company paid $ 65million to the\nState of New York. In December 2018, the\nCompany entered into an agreement with all 50\nstate Attorneys General and the District of\nColumbia to resolve an investigation into the\nCompany\u2019s retail sales practices, CPI and GAP,\nand mortgage interest rate lock matters,\npursuant to which the Company paid $\n575million . On February 21, 2020 , the\nCompany entered into an agreement with the\nDepartment of Justice to resolve the\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s criminal investigation\ninto the Company\u2019s retail sales practices, as\nwell as a separate agreement to resolve the\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s civil investigation.\nAs part of the Department of Justice criminal\nsettlement, no charges will be filed against\nthe Company provided the Company abides by all\nthe terms of the agreement. The Department of\nJustice criminal settlement also includes the\nCompany\u2019s agreement that the facts set forth\nin the settlement document constitute\nsufficient facts for the finding of criminal\nviolations of statutes regarding bank records\nand personal information. On February 21, 2020\n, the Company also entered into an order to\nresolve the SEC\u2019s investigation arising out of\nthe Company\u2019s retail sales practices. The SEC\norder contains a finding, to which 124 Note\n14: Legal Actions ( continued ) the Company\nconsented, that the facts set forth include\nviolations of Section 10(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\nthereunder. As part of the resolution of the\nDepartment of Justice and SEC investigations,\nthe Company has agreed to make payments\ntotaling $ 3.0billion . In addition, as part\nof the settlements and included in the $\n3.0billion amount, the Company has agreed to\nthe creation of a $ 500million Fair Fund for\nthe benefit of investors who were harmed by\nthe conduct covered in the SEC settlement. In\naddition, a number of lawsuits have been filed\nby non-governmental parties seeking damages or\nother remedies related to these retail sales\npractices. First, various class plaintiffs,\npurporting to represent consumers who allege\nthat they received products or services\nwithout their authorization or consent, have\nbrought separate putative class actions\nagainst the Company in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia and various other jurisdictions. On\nJune 14, 2018, the district court granted\nfinal approval of a settlement entered into by\nthe Company in the first-filed action, Jabbari\nv. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A ., pursuant to which\nthe Company will pay $ 142million to resolve\nclaims regarding certain products or services\nprovided without authorization or consent for\nthe time period May 1, 2002 to April 20, 2017.\nOn July 20, 2020, the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the\ndistrict court's order granting final approval\nof the settlement. Second, the Company was\nsubject to a consolidated securities fraud\nclass action alleging certain misstatements\nand omissions in the Company\u2019s disclosures\nrelated to sales practices matters. The\nCompany entered into a settlement agreement to\nresolve this matter pursuant to which the\nCompany paid $ 480million . Third, Wells Fargo\nshareholders have brought numerous shareholder\nderivative lawsuits asserting breach of\nfiduciary duty claims against, among others,\ncurrent and former directors and officers for\ntheir alleged involvement with and failure to\ndetect and prevent sales practices issues.\nThese actions are currently pending in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California and California state\ncourt as consolidated or coordinated\nproceedings. The parties have entered into\nsettlement agreements to resolve the\nshareholder derivative lawsuits pursuant to\nwhich insurance carriers will pay the Company\napproximately $ 240million for alleged damage\nto the Company, and the Company will pay\nplaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees. The federal court\ngranted final approval of the settlement for\nits action on April 7, 2020. The state court\ngranted final approval of the settlement for\nits action on January 15, 2020. Fourth, a\npurported Employee Retirement Income Security\nAct (ERISA) class action was filed in the\nUnited States District Court for the District\nof Minnesota on behalf of 401(k) plan\nparticipants. The district court dismissed the\naction, and on July 27, 2020, the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\naffirmed the dismissal. RMBS TRUSTEE\nLITIGATION In November 2014, a group of\ninstitutional investors (Institutional\nInvestor Plaintiffs), including funds\naffiliated with BlackRock, Inc., filed a\nputative class action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of\nNew York against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,\nalleging claims against the Company in its\ncapacity as trustee for a number of\nresidential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS)\ntrusts (Federal Court Complaint). Similar\ncomplaints have been filed against other\ntrustees in various courts, including in the\nSouthern District of New York, in New York\nstate court, and in other states, by RMBS\ninvestors. The Federal Court Complaint alleged\nthat Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee,\ncaused losses to investors and asserted causes\nof action based upon, among other things, the\ntrustee\u2019s alleged failure to notify and\nenforce repurchase obligations of mortgage\nloan sellers for purported breaches of\nrepresentations and warranties, notify\ninvestors of alleged events of default, and\nabide by appropriate standards of care\nfollowing alleged events of default.\nPlaintiffs sought money damages in an\nunspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses,\nand equitable relief. In December 2014 and\nDecember 2015, certain other investors filed\nadditional complaints alleging similar claims\nagainst Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in the\nSouthern District of New York (Related Federal\nCases). In January 2016, the Southern District\nof New York entered an order in connection\nwith the Federal Court Complaint dismissing\nclaims related to certain of the trusts at\nissue (Dismissed Trusts). The Company\u2019s\nsubsequent motion to dismiss the Federal Court\nComplaint and the complaints for the Related\nFederal Cases was granted in part and denied\nin part in March 2017. In May 2017, the\nCompany filed third-party complaints against\ncertain investment advisors affiliated with\nthe Institutional Investor Plaintiffs seeking\ncontribution with respect to claims alleged in\nthe Federal Court Complaint (Third-Party\nClaims). In December 2016, the Institutional\nInvestor Plaintiffs filed a new putative class\naction complaint in New York state court in\nrespect of 261 RMBS trusts, including the\nDismissed Trusts, for which Wells Fargo Bank,\nN.A., serves or served as trustee (State Court\nAction). A complaint raising similar\nallegations to those in the Federal Court\nComplaint was filed in May 2016 in New York\nstate court by IKB International and IKB\nDeutsche Industriebank (IKB Action). In July\n2017, certain of the plaintiffs from the State\nCourt Action filed a civil complaint relating\nto Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\u2019s setting aside\nreserves for legal fees and expenses in\nconnection with the liquidation of eleven RMBS\ntrusts at issue in the State Court Action\n(Declaratory Judgment Action). The complaint\nsought, among other relief, declarations that\nthe Company is not entitled to\nindemnification, the advancement of funds, or\nthe taking of reserves from trust funds for\nlegal fees and expenses it incurs in defending\nthe claims in the State Court Action. In May\n2019, the New York state court approved a\nsettlement agreement among the Institutional\nInvestor Plaintiffs and the Company pursuant\nto which, among other terms, the Company paid\n$ 43million to resolve the Federal Court\nComplaint and the State Court Action. The\nsettlement also resolved the Third Party\nClaims and the Declaratory Judgment Action.\nThe settlement did not affect the Related\nFederal Cases or the IKB Action, which remain\npending. SEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION The\nSeminole Tribe of Florida filed a complaint in\nFlorida state court alleging that Wells Fargo,\nas trustee, charged excess fees in connection\nwith the administration of a minor\u2019s trust and\nfailed to invest the assets of the trust\nprudently. The complaint was later amended to\ninclude three individual current and former\nbeneficiaries as plaintiffs and to remove the\nTribe as a party to the case. In December\n2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss\nthe amended complaint on the grounds that the\nTribe is a necessary party and that the\nindividual beneficiaries lack standing to\nbring claims. The motion was denied in June\n2018. The case is pending trial. WHOLESALE\nBANKING CONSENT ORDER INVESTIGATION On\nNovember 19, 2015, the Company entered into a\nconsent order with the OCC, pursuant to which\nthe Wholesale Banking group was required to\nimplement customer due diligence standards\nthat include collection of current beneficial\nownership information for certain business\ncustomers. The Company is responding to 125\ninquiries from various federal government\nagencies regarding potentially inappropriate\nconduct in connection with the collection of\nbeneficial ownership information. OUTLOOK As\ndescribed above, the Company establishes\naccruals for legal actions when potential\nlosses associated with the actions become\nprobable and the costs can be reasonably\nestimated. The high end of the range of\nreasonably possible potential losses in excess\nof the Company\u2019s accrual for probable and\nestimable losses was approximately $\n2.3billion as of June 30, 2020 . The outcomes\nof legal actions are unpredictable and subject\nto significant uncertainties, and it is\ninherently difficult to determine whether any\nloss is probable or even possible. It is also\ninherently difficult to estimate the amount of\nany loss and there may be matters for which a\nloss is probable or reasonably possible but\nnot currently estimable. Accordingly, actual\nlosses may be in excess of the established\naccrual or the range of reasonably possible\nloss. Wells Fargo is unable to determine\nwhether the ultimate resolution of the retail\nsales practices matters will have a material\nadverse effect on its consolidated financial\ncondition. Based on information currently\navailable, advice of counsel, available\ninsurance coverage, and established reserves,\nWells Fargo believes that the eventual outcome\nof other actions against Wells Fargo and/or\nits subsidiaries will not, individually or in\nthe aggregate, have a material adverse effect\non Wells Fargo\u2019s consolidated financial\ncondition. However, it is possible that the\nultimate resolution of a matter, if\nunfavorable, may be material to Wells Fargo\u2019s\nresults of operations for any particular\nperiod. 126 Note 15: Derivatives ( continued )\n                         \n  Note 15:  Derivatives  \n                         \nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to\nmarket risk, including interest rate risk,\ncredit risk and foreign currency risk, and to\nassist customers with their risk management\nobjectives. We designate certain derivatives\nas hedging instruments in qualifying hedge\naccounting relationships (fair value or cash\nflow hedges). Our remaining derivatives\nconsist of economic hedges that do not qualify\nfor hedge accounting, and derivatives held for\ncustomer accommodation trading or other\npurposes.

Table\n15.1 presents the total notional or\ncontractual amounts and fair values for our\nderivatives. Derivative transactions can be\nmeasured in terms of the notional amount, but\nthis amount is not recorded on the balance\nsheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a\nmeaningful measure of the risk profile of the\ninstruments. The notional amount is generally\nnot exchanged but is used only as the basis on\nwhich interest and other payments are\ndetermined.\n\nTable 15.1: Notional or Contractual Amounts\nand Fair Values of Derivatives\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                           \u2026                  \n                    \u2026      \u2026             \u2026    \n                    \u2026      \u2026             \u2026    \n                           \u2026                  \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2026      \u2014    \n             \u2026      \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026      \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n127 Table 15.2 provides information on the\ngross fair values of derivative assets and\nliabilities, the balance sheet netting\nadjustments and the resulting net fair value\namount recorded on our balance sheet, as well\nas the non-cash collateral associated with\nsuch arrangements. We execute substantially\nall of our derivative transactions under\nmaster netting arrangements and reflect all\nderivative balances and related cash\ncollateral subject to enforceable master\nnetting arrangements on a net basis within the\nbalance sheet. The \u201cGross amounts recognized\u201d\ncolumn in the following table includes $\n59.6billion and $ 54.7billion of gross\nderivative assets and liabilities,\nrespectively, at June 30, 2020 , and $\n33.7billion and $ 33.5billion , respectively,\nat December 31, 2019 , with counterparties\nsubject to enforceable master netting\narrangements that are eligible for balance\nsheet netting adjustments. The majority of\nthese amounts are interest rate contracts\nexecuted in over-the-counter (OTC) markets.\nThe remaining gross derivative assets and\nliabilities of $ 8.3billion and $ 5.1billion ,\nrespectively, at June 30, 2020 , and $\n5.6billion and $ 4.4billion , respectively, at\nDecember 31, 2019 , include those with\ncounterparties subject to master netting\narrangements for which we have not assessed\nthe enforceability because they are with\ncounterparties where we do not currently have\npositions to offset, those subject to master\nnetting arrangements where we have not been\nable to confirm the enforceability and those\nnot subject to master netting arrangements. As\nsuch, we do not net derivative balances or\ncollateral within the balance sheet for these\ncounterparties. Cash collateral receivables\nand payables that have not been offset against\nour derivatives were $ 1.2billion and $\n1.4billion , respectively, at June 30, 2020 ,\nand $ 6.3billion and $ 1.4billion ,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2019 . We\ndetermine the balance sheet netting\nadjustments based on the terms specified\nwithin each master netting arrangement. We\ndisclose the balance sheet netting amounts\nwithin the column titled \u201cGross amounts offset\nin consolidated balance sheet.\u201d Balance sheet\nnetting adjustments are determined at the\ncounterparty level for which there may be\nmultiple contract types. For disclosure\npurposes, we allocate these netting\nadjustments to the contract type for each\ncounterparty proportionally based upon the\n\u201cGross amounts recognized\u201d by counterparty. As\na result, the net amounts disclosed by\ncontract type may not represent the actual\nexposure upon settlement of the contracts. We\ndo not net non-cash collateral that we receive\nand pledge on the balance sheet. For\ndisclosure purposes, we present the fair value\nof this non-cash collateral in the column\ntitled \u201cGross amounts not offset in\nconsolidated balance sheet (Disclosure-only\nnetting)\u201d within the table. We determine and\nallocate the Disclosure-only netting amounts\nin the same manner as balance sheet netting\namounts. The \u201cNet amounts\u201d column within Table\n15.2 represents the aggregate of our net\nexposure to each counterparty after\nconsidering the balance sheet and Disclosure-\nonly netting adjustments. We manage derivative\nexposure by monitoring the credit risk\nassociated with each counterparty using\ncounterparty specific credit risk limits,\nusing master netting arrangements and\nobtaining collateral. Derivative contracts\nexecuted in OTC markets include bilateral\ncontractual arrangements that are not cleared\nthrough a central clearing organization but\nare typically subject to master netting\narrangements. Other derivative contracts that\nare settled through a central clearing\norganization whether OTC or exchange-traded,\nare excluded from that percentage. In addition\nto the netting amounts included in the table,\nwe also have balance sheet netting related to\nresale and repurchase agreements that are\ndisclosed within Note 13 (Guarantees, Pledged\nAssets and Collateral, and Other Commitments).\n128 Note 15: Derivatives ( continued )\n\nTable 15.2: Gross Fair Values of Derivative\nAssets and Liabilities\n                                              \n                         G\u2026                   \n                         a\u2026                   \n            \u2026            n\u2026                   \n            \u2026            o\u2026                   \n            \u2026       \u2026    in                   \n            \u2026       \u2026    c\u2026            P\u2026     \n            \u2026       \u2026    b\u2026            e\u2026     \n       \u2026    \u2026       \u2026    s\u2026            in     \n       \u2026    \u2026       \u2026    (\u2026       \u2026    o\u2026     \n       \u2026    \u2026       \u2026    n\u2026       \u2026    m\u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n    $  \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (\u2026  )    \u2026    97  %  \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (3  )    \u2026    73     \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (\u2026  )    \u2026    67     \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (4  )    \u2026    1\u2026     \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    2    \u2014        2    68     \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (2  )    \u2026    89     \n    $  \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (\u2026  )    \u2026           \n                                              \n    $  \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (\u2026  )    \u2026    96  %  \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (2  )    \u2026    86     \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (\u2026  )    \u2026    73     \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (\u2026  )    \u2026    1\u2026     \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    4    \u2014        4    95     \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    \u2014        \u2026    84     \n    $  \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (\u2026  )    \u2026           \n                                              \n                                              \n    $  \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (\u2026  )    \u2026    95  %  \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (2  )    \u2026    80     \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (\u2026  )    \u2026    65     \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (\u2026  )    \u2026    1\u2026     \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    3    \u2014        3    84     \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (1  )    \u2026    97     \n    $  \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (\u2026  )    \u2026           \n                                              \n    $  \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (\u2026  )    \u2026    94  %  \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (2  )    \u2026    82     \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (\u2026  )    \u2026    81     \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (\u2026  )    \u2026    1\u2026     \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    5    (3  )    2    98     \n       \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    \u2014        \u2026    93     \n    $  \u2026    \u2026  )    \u2026    (\u2026  )    \u2026           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents amounts with                \n       counterparties subject to enforceable  \n       master netting arrangements that have  \n       been offset in the consolidated        \n       balance sheet, including related cash  \n       collateral and portfolio level         \n       counterparty valuation adjustments.    \n       Counterparty valuation adjustments     \n       related to derivative assets were      \n       $600 million and $231 million and      \n  (1)  debit valuation adjustments related    \n       to derivative liabilities were $229    \n       million and $100 million at June\u00a030,   \n       2020, and December\u00a031, 2019,           \n       respectively.

In\naddition, we use interest rate swaps, cross-\ncurrency swaps, cross-currency interest rate\nswaps and forward contracts to hedge against\nchanges in fair value of certain investments\nin available-for-sale debt securities due to\nchanges in interest rates, foreign currency\nrates, or both. We also use interest rate\nswaps to hedge against changes in fair value\nfor certain mortgage loans held for sale. For\ncertain fair value hedges of foreign currency\nrisk, changes in fair value of cross-currency\nswaps attributable to changes in cross-\ncurrency basis spreads are excluded from the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded\nin other comprehensive income. See Note 26\n(Other Comprehensive Income) for the amounts\nrecognized in other comprehensive income. For\ncash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps\nto hedge the variability in interest payments\nreceived on certain floating-rate commercial\nloans and paid on certain floating-rate debt\ndue to changes in the contractually specified\ninterest rate. We also use cross-currency\nswaps to hedge variability in interest\npayments on fixed-rate foreign currency-\ndenominated long-term debt due to changes in\nforeign exchange rates. We estimate $\n203million pre-tax of deferred net losses\nrelated to cash flow hedges in OCI at June 30,\n2020 , will be reclassified into net interest\nincome during the next twelve months. The\ndeferred losses expected to be reclassified\ninto net 129 interest income are predominantly\nrelated to discontinued hedges of floating\nrate loans. For cash flow hedges as of June\n30, 2020 , we are hedging our foreign currency\nexposure to the variability of future cash\nflows for all forecasted transactions for a\nmaximum of 10years . For more information on\nour accounting hedges, see Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) and Note 18\n(Derivatives) in our 2019 Form 10-K.

We use\neconomic hedge derivatives to manage our\nexposure to interest rate risk, equity price\nrisk, foreign currency risk, and credit risk.\nWe also use economic hedge derivatives to\nmitigate the periodic earnings volatility\ncaused by mismatches between the changes in\nfair value of the hedged item and hedging\ninstrument recognized on our fair value\naccounting hedges. In second quarter 2020, we\nentered into arrangements to transition the\neconomic hedges of our deferred compensation\nplan liabilities from equity securities to\nderivative instruments. Changes in the fair\nvalues of derivatives used to economically\nhedge the deferred compensation plan are\nreported in personnel expense.

is\nderived from the transfer of credit risk of a\nreference asset or entity from one party (the\npurchaser of credit protection) to another\nparty (the seller of credit protection). We\nuse credit derivatives to assist customers\nwith their risk management objectives. We may\nalso use credit derivatives in structured\nproduct transactions or liquidity agreements\nwritten to special purpose vehicles. The\nmaximum exposure of sold credit derivatives is\nmanaged through posted collateral, purchased\ncredit derivatives and similar products in\norder to achieve our desired credit risk\nprofile. This credit risk management provides\nan ability to recover a significant portion of\nany amounts that would be paid under the sold\ncredit derivatives. We would be required to\nperform under sold credit derivatives in the\nevent of default by the referenced obligors.\nEvents of default include events such as\nbankruptcy, capital restructuring or lack of\nprincipal and/or interest payment. In certain\ncases, other triggers may exist, such as the\ncredit downgrade of the referenced obligors or\nthe inability of the special purpose vehicle\nfor which we have provided liquidity to obtain\nfunding.

Assets and liabilities recorded\nat fair value on a recurring basis are\npresented in Table 16.2 in this Note. From\ntime to time, we may be required to record\nfair value adjustments on a nonrecurring\nbasis. These nonrecurring fair value\nadjustments typically involve application of\nLOCOM accounting, write-downs of individual\nassets or application of the measurement\nalternative for nonmarketable equity\nsecurities. Assets recorded on a nonrecurring\nbasis are presented in Table 16.1 3 in this\nNote. Table 16.19 includes estimates of fair\nvalue for financial instruments that are not\nrecorded at fair value. See Note 1 (Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies) in our 2019\nForm 10-K for discussion of how we determine\nfair value. For descriptions of the valuation\nmethodologies we use for assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair value on a\nrecurring or nonrecurring basis and for\nestimating fair value for financial\ninstruments that are not recorded at fair\nvalue, see Note 19 (Fair Values of Assets and\nLiabilities) in our 2019 Form 10-K. FAIR VALUE\nHIERARCHY We classify our assets and\nliabilities measured at fair value as either\nLevel 1, Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value\nhierarchy. The highest priority (Level 1) is\nassigned to valuations based on unadjusted\nquoted prices in active markets and the lowest\npriority (Level 3) is assigned to valuations\nbased on significant unobservable inputs. See\nNote 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies) in our 2019 Form 10-K for a detailed\ndescription of the fair value hierarchy. In\nthe determination of the classification of\nfinancial instruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy, we consider all\navailable information, including observable\nmarket data, indications of market liquidity\nand orderliness, and our understanding of the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs\nused. For securities in inactive markets, we\nuse a predetermined percentage to evaluate the\nimpact of fair value adjustments derived from\nweighting both external and internal\nindications of value to determine if the\ninstrument is classified as Level 2 or Level\n3. Otherwise, the classification of Level 2 or\nLevel 3 is based upon the specific facts and\ncircumstances of each instrument or instrument\ncategory and judgments are made regarding the\nsignificance of the Level 3 inputs to the\ninstruments\u2019 fair value measurement in its\nentirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered\nsignificant, the instrument is classified as\nLevel 3. We do not classify equity securities\nin the fair value hierarchy if we use the non-\npublished net asset value (NAV) per share (or\nits equivalent) that has been communicated to\nus as an investor as a practical expedient to\nmeasure fair value. We generally use NAV per\nshare as the fair value measurement for\ncertain nonmarketable equity fund investments.\nMarketable equity securities with published\nNAVs are classified in the fair value\nhierarchy. Fair Value Measurements from\nVendors For certain assets and liabilities, we\nobtain fair value measurements from vendors\nand we record the fair value in our financial\nstatements. For additional information, see\nNote 19 (Fair Values of Assets and\nLiabilities) in our 2019 Form 10-K. Table 16.1\npresents fair value measurements obtained from\nthird-party pricing services classified within\nthe fair value hierarchy. Fair value\nmeasurements obtained from brokers and fair\nvalue measurements obtained from third-party\npricing services that we have adjusted using\ninternal models or non-vendor data to\ndetermine the fair value are excluded from\nTable 16.1 . The unadjusted fair value\nmeasurements obtained from brokers for\navailable-for-sale debt securities were $\n19million in Level 2 assets and $ 123million\nin Level 3 assets at June 30, 2020 , and $\n45million and $ 126million at December 31,\n2019 , respectively.\n\nTable 16.1: Fair Value Measurements obtained\nfrom Third-Party Pricing Services\n                                              \n

in the valuation of substantially all of\nour Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at\nfair value on a recurring basis for which we\nuse an internal model. The significant\nunobservable inputs for Level 3 assets and\nliabilities inherent in the fair values\nobtained from third-party vendors are not\nincluded in the table, as the specific inputs\napplied are not provided by the vendor. In\naddition, the table excludes the valuation\ntechniques and significant unobservable inputs\nfor certain classes of Level 3 assets and\nliabilities measured using internal models\nthat we consider, both individually and in the\naggregate, insignificant relative to our\noverall Level 3 assets and liabilities. We\nmade this determination based upon an\nevaluation of each class, which considered the\nmagnitude of the positions, nature of the\nunobservable inputs and potential for\nsignificant changes in fair value due to\nchanges in those inputs. Weighted averages of\ninputs are calculated using outstanding unpaid\nprincipal balance for cash instruments, such\nas loans and securities, and notional amounts\nfor derivative instruments.

private\nequity and venture capital investments in\nportfolio companies. The market approach bases\nthe fair value measurement on market data (for\nexample, use of market comparable pricing\ntechniques) that are used to derive the\nenterprise value of the portfolio company.\nMarket comparable pricing techniques include\nutilization of financial metrics of comparable\npublic companies (multiples), such as ratios\nof enterprise value or market value of equity\nto revenue, EBITDA, net income or book value.\nComparable company valuation multiples are\nevaluated and adjusted as necessary to reflect\nthe comparative operational, financial or\nmarketability differences between the public\ncompany and subject portfolio company in\nestimating its fair value. Market comparable\npricing techniques also use recent or\nanticipated transactions (for example, a\nfinancing round, merger, acquisition or\nbankruptcy) involving the subject portfolio\ncompany, or participants in its industry or\nrelated industries. Based upon these recent or\nanticipated transactions, current market\nconditions and other factors specific to the\nissuer, we make adjustments to estimate the\nenterprise value of the portfolio company. As\na result of the recent market environment, we\nalso utilized other valuation techniques.\nThese techniques included the use of company\nrisk factors in the estimation of the fair\nvalue of certain nonmarketable equity\nsecurities. The company risk factors are based\nupon entity-specific considerations including\nthe debt and liquidity profile, projected cash\nflow or funding issues as well as other\nfactors that may affect the company\u2019s outlook.\n152 Note 16: Fair Values of Assets and\nLiabilities ( continued ) Fair Value Option\nThe fair value option is an irrevocable\nelection, generally only permitted upon\ninitial recognition of financial assets or\nliabilities, to measure eligible financial\ninstruments at fair value with changes in fair\nvalue reflected in earnings. We may elect the\nfair value option to align the measurement\nmodel with how the financial assets or\nliabilities are managed or to reduce\ncomplexity or accounting asymmetry. For more\ninformation, including the basis for our fair\nvalue option elections, see Note 19 (Fair\nValues of Assets and Liabilities) in our 2019\nForm 10-K.

This\ntable also excludes assets and liabilities\nthat are not financial instruments such as the\nvalue of the long-term relationships with our\ndeposit, credit card and trust customers,\nMSRs, premises and equipment, goodwill and\ndeferred taxes. Loan commitments, standby\nletters of credit and commercial and similar\nletters of credit are not included in Table\n16.19 . A reasonable estimate of the fair\nvalue of these instruments is the carrying\nvalue of deferred fees plus the allowance for\nunfunded credit commitments, which totaled $\n1.7billion and $ 1.0billion at June 30, 2020\nand December 31, 2019 , respectively.

The Cash Balance Plan was\nfrozen on July 1, 2009, and no new benefits\nhave accrued after that date. For additional\ninformation on our pension and postretirement\nplans, including plan assumptions, investment\nstrategy and asset allocation, projected\nbenefit payments, and valuation methodologies\nused for assets measured at fair value, see\nNote 23 (Employee Benefits and Other Expenses)\nin our 2019 Form 10-K. We recognize settlement\nlosses for our Cash Balance Plan based on an\nassessment of whether lump sum benefit\npayments will, in aggregate for the year,\nexceed the sum of its annual service and\ninterest cost. Settlement losses of $\n70million were recognized during second\nquarter 2020 representing the pro rata portion\nof the net loss in cumulative other\ncomprehensive income based on the percentage\nreduction in the Cash Balance Plan\u2019s projected\nbenefit obligation attributable to lump sum\nbenefit payments during the first half of 2020\n. As a result of the settlement losses, we re-\nmeasured the Cash Balance Plan obligation and\nplan assets as of June 30, 2020 , and used a\ndiscount rate of 2.75% based on our consistent\nmethodology of determining our discount rate\nusing a yield curve with maturity dates that\nclosely match the estimated timing of the\nexpected benefit payments. The result of the\nsettlement losses and re-measurement increased\nthe Cash Balance Plan liability by $\n674million and decreased other comprehensive\nincome by $ 604million (pre tax) in second\nquarter 2020.

These segments are defined\nby product type and customer segment and their\nresults are based on our management reporting\nprocess. The management reporting process is\nbased on U.S. GAAP with specific adjustments,\nsuch as for funds transfer pricing for\nasset/liability management, for shared\nrevenues and expenses, and tax-equivalent\nadjustments to consistently reflect income\nfrom taxable and tax-exempt sources. On\nFebruary 11, 2020, we announced a new\norganizational structure with five principal\nlines of business: Consumer and Small Business\nBanking; Consumer Lending; Commercial Banking;\nCorporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth\nand Investment Management. This new\norganizational structure is intended to help\ndrive operating, control, and business\nperformance. In July 2020, the Company\ncompleted the transition to this new\norganizational structure, including finalizing\nleadership for these principal business lines\nand aligning management reporting and\nallocation methodologies. These changes will\nnot impact the consolidated financial results\nof the Company. Accordingly, we will update\nour operating segment disclosures, including\ncomparative financial results, in third\nquarter 2020. For a description of our\noperating segments, see Note 27 (Operating\nSegments) in our 2019 Form 10-K.

The Federal Reserve establishes\ncapital requirements for the consolidated\nfinancial holding company, and the OCC has\nsimilar requirements for the Company\u2019s\nnational banks, including Wells Fargo Bank,\nN.A. (the Bank). Table 23.1 presents\nregulatory capital information for Wells Fargo\n& Company and the Bank in accordance with\nBasel III capital requirements. We must report\nthe lower of our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1),\ntier 1 and total capital ratios calculated\nunder the Standardized Approach and under the\nAdvanced Approach in the assessment of our\ncapital adequacy. The Standardized Approach\napplies assigned risk weights to broad risk\ncategories, while the calculation of risk-\nweighted assets (RWAs) under the Advanced\nApproach differs by requiring applicable banks\nto utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which\nrelies upon the use of internal credit models,\nand includes an operational risk component.\nThe Basel III capital requirements for\ncalculating CET1 and tier 1 capital, along\nwith RWAs, are fully phased-in. However, the\nrequirements for determining tier 2 and total\ncapital are still in accordance with\nTransition Requirements and are scheduled to\nbe fully phased-in by the end of 2021.\nAccordingly, the information presented below\nreflects fully phased-in CET1 capital, tier 1\ncapital, and RWAs, but reflects total capital\nstill in accordance with Transition\nRequirements.
