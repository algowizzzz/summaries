In addition, as of December  \n31, 2022, of the Company\u2019s 13 directors, 6    \nwere women and 4 were people of color. The    \ndiversity percentages noted above do not      \ninclude employees from the MUB acquisition who\njoined the Company on December 1, 2022, as the\ndata regarding MUB employees is being verified\nas part of the acquisition integration        \nprocess. All diversity information is based on\ninformation self-disclosed by the employee or \ndirector to the Company. To provide           \ntransparency on progress relating to its      \ncommitment to seek and promote diverse talent,\nthe Company publicly discloses consolidated   \nEEO-1 data.

In 2022, the\nCompany made material compensation investments\nin its workforce, including increasing the    \nminimum base hourly wage from $15 to $20 per  \nhour for U.S. employees and implementing      \ntargeted off-cycle compensation increases to  \ncertain employee groups globally to improve   \ncompetitive compensation and address          \nescalating inflationary pressures. More than  \n50% of the Company\u2019s employees were positively\nimpacted by these actions in 2022. The Company\nremains committed to fair pay and continues to\nprioritize pay equity efforts. To further the \nCompany\u2019s efforts to provide fair and         \nequitable compensation to its diverse         \nemployees, the Company has processes to       \naddress any gender and racial pay inequities  \nidentified within its workforce. This work    \nstarts with fair hiring practices. The Company\nalso has guidelines in place for both internal\nand external job postings to assist the       \nCompany\u2019s leaders in making fair compensation \ndecisions based on the demands and            \nresponsibilities of each role, candidate      \nexperience, and pay related to comparable     \ninternal positions. The Company conducts      \nperiodic reviews of base pay of employee      \ngroups across gender and racial categories    \nwith the assistance of an independent third-  \nparty consultant. Should gender or race-based \ndisparities in pay be identified, the Company \nadjusts compensation levels to eliminate those\ndisparities. In the 2022 review, on average,  \nemployees of the Company in the United States \nwho are women were paid greater than 99       \npercent of what their male counterparts were  \npaid, and employees of the Company in the     \nUnited States who are people of color were    \npaid greater than 99 percent of what their    \nwhite counterparts were paid, taking into     \naccount several factors including comparable  \njobs, experience and location. The 2022 review\ndid not include employees from the MUB        \nacquisition who joined the Company on December\n1, 2022.                                      \n                                              \nThe Company also provides its employees with  \ncomprehensive benefits programs, including    \ncompetitive healthcare, retirement, leave,    \nrecognition, wellness, disability, life       \ninsurance, time-off, flexible work, and       \neducational assistance programs, based on the \nCompany\u2019s recognition that such benefits are  \nimportant to attract and retain employees.

In addition\nto its competitive 401(k) matching program,   \nthe Company maintains an active cash balance  \npension program for its U.S. employees,       \nincluding newly hired employees.              \n                                              \nThe Company continues to support flexible work\nprograms with remote, hybrid and in-person    \nwork arrangements, providing additional       \noptionality and flexibility for most          \nemployees, which helps the Company attract and\nretain talent. The Company continues to adapt \nand evolve its flexible work programs as it   \nrecognizes the changes to employee and        \ncustomer priorities as a result of the        \npandemic and its customers\u2019 changing needs.   \n                                              \nEmployee Engagement and Retention As part of  \nits efforts to develop and retain skilled     \nemployees, the Company remains focused on     \nmonitoring employee engagement.

The Company provides\na number of talent development offerings for  \nemployees to improve skills that are critical \nin the current and future working environment \nand empowers employees to discover ways to    \n                      6                       \nthrive and grow their careers, which aligns   \nwith the Company\u2019s Employment Value           \nProposition. For example, the Company\u2019s       \nlearning programs include the Digital Academy \nand the People Leader Center, which focus on  \ndigital skill development and core leadership \nskill development, respectively. The Company  \nalso introduced enhanced cultural sensitivity \nand customer interaction training in 2022 for \nits frontline employees that focuses on       \nbuilding skills to serve all our customers    \nwith excellence. In addition, every employee  \nis automatically included in the Company\u2019s    \nDevelopment Network that provides all         \nemployees with opportunities to network,      \nlearn, develop leadership skills and          \ncontribute to the Company and its communities.\nSuccession planning and talent development    \nprocesses remain a top priority for the       \nCompany along with continuous improvements to \nits training and development programs. During \n2022, employees completed over 1.4 million    \nhours of training through the Company\u2019s       \nenterprise learning programs to better support\nits professional development, and customer and\nbusiness needs.                               \n                                              \nHuman Capital Governance The Company\u2019s Board  \nof Directors oversees the Company\u2019s human     \ncapital management. The Board\u2019s Compensation  \nand Human Resources Committee discharges the  \nBoard\u2019s oversight responsibilities relating to\nthe Company\u2019s compensation programs and       \nemployee benefit plans, overseeing the        \nCompany\u2019s human capital strategy and talent   \nmanagement program and employee diversity,    \nequity and inclusion initiatives.

To promote\naccountability for the Company\u2019s diversity,   \nequity and inclusion efforts, the Company\u2019s   \nChief Executive Officer chairs the Company\u2019s  \nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee,    \nwith the Company\u2019s Chief Diversity Officer    \nreporting directly to the Chief Executive     \nOfficer and serving as a member of its senior \nmanagement team.                              \n                                              \nCompetition                                   \n                                              \nThe financial services industry is highly     \ncompetitive. The Company competes with other  \ncommercial banks, savings and loan            \nassociations, mutual savings banks, finance   \ncompanies, mortgage banking companies, credit \nunions, investment companies, credit card     \ncompanies and a variety of other financial    \nservices, advisory and technology companies.  \nThe financial services industry continues to  \nundergo rapid technological change with       \nfrequent introductions of new technology-     \ndriven products and services, including       \ninnovative ways that customers can make       \npayments or manage their accounts, such as    \nthrough the use of mobile payments, digital   \nwallets or digital currencies. In recent      \nyears, competition has increased from         \ninstitutions not subject to the same          \nregulatory restrictions as domestic banks and \nbank holding companies, including by financial\ntechnology companies, or \u201cfintechs,\u201d which may\noffer bank-like products or services that     \ncompete directly with the Company\u2019s products  \nand services. Competition is based on a number\nof factors, including, among others, customer \nservice, quality and range of products and    \nservices offered, price, reputation, interest \nrates on loans and deposits, lending limits   \nand customer convenience, including the       \nability to address customer needs by using    \ntechnology to provide products and services   \nthat customers want to adopt. The Company\u2019s   \nability to continue to compete effectively    \nalso depends in large part on its ability to  \nattract new employees and retain and motivate \nexisting employees, while managing            \ncompensation and other costs. For additional  \ninformation relating to how the Company       \nattracts and retains employees, see \u201cHuman    \nCapital\u201d above.                               \n                                              \nInformation Security                          \n                                              \nInformation security, including cybersecurity,\nis a high priority for the Company. Recent    \nhighly publicized events have highlighted the \nimportance of cybersecurity, including        \ncyberattacks against financial institutions,  \ngovernmental agencies and other organizations \nthat resulted in the compromise of personal   \nand/or confidential information, the theft or \ndestruction of corporate information, and     \ndemands for ransom payments to release        \ncorporate information encrypted by so-called  \n\u201cransomware.\u201d A successful cyberattack,       \nincluding an attack at a third-party vendor   \nthe Company utilizes, could harm the Company\u2019s\nreputation and/or impair its ability to       \nprovide services to its customers.

These  \nlaws, rules and policies include, for example,\nstatutory maximum legal lending rates,        \ndomestic monetary policies of the Board of    \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (the  \n\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d), United States fiscal      \npolicy, international currency regulations and\nmonetary policies and capital adequacy and    \nliquidity constraints imposed by bank         \nregulatory agencies.                          \n                                              \nSupervision and Regulation                    \n                                              \nU.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject \nto the extensive regulatory framework         \napplicable to bank holding companies (\u201cBHCs\u201d) \nand their subsidiaries. This regulatory       \nframework is intended primarily for the       \nprotection of depositors, the deposit         \ninsurance fund (the \u201cDIF\u201d) of the Federal     \nDeposit Insurance Corporation (the \u201cFDIC\u201d),   \nconsumers, the stability of the financial     \nsystem in the United States, and the health of\nthe national economy, and not for investors in\nthe Company.                                  \n                                              \nThis section summarizes certain provisions of \nthe principal laws and regulations applicable \nto the Company and its subsidiaries. The      \ndescriptions are not intended to be complete  \nand are qualified in their entirety by        \nreference to the full text of the statutes and\nregulations described below.                  \n                                              \nGeneral As a BHC, the Company is subject to   \nregulation under the BHC Act and to           \ninspection, examination and supervision by the\nFederal Reserve. USBNA, MUB and their         \nrespective subsidiaries are subject to        \nregulation, examination and supervision       \nprimarily by the Office of the Comptroller of \nthe Currency (the \u201cOCC\u201d) and also by the FDIC,\nthe Federal Reserve, the Consumer Financial   \nProtection Bureau (the \u201cCFPB\u201d), the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and the   \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission (the   \n\u201cCFTC\u201d) in certain areas.                     \n                                              \nSupervision and regulation by the responsible \nregulatory agencies generally include         \ncomprehensive annual reviews of all major     \naspects of the Company\u2019s, USBNA\u2019s and MUB\u2019s   \nbusiness and condition, regular on-site       \nexaminations, and imposition of periodic      \nreporting requirements and limitations on     \ninvestments and certain types of activities.  \nIf the applicable regulatory agencies deem the\nCompany to be operating in a manner that is   \ninconsistent with safe and sound banking      \npractices, the agencies can require the entry \ninto informal or formal supervisory           \nagreements, including board resolutions,      \nmemoranda of understanding, written agreements\nand consent or cease and desist orders,       \npursuant to which the Company would be        \nrequired to take identified corrective actions\nto address cited concerns and to refrain from \ntaking certain actions. Supervision and       \nexaminations are confidential, and the        \noutcomes of these actions generally are not   \nmade public.                                  \n                                              \nBanking and other financial services statutes,\nregulations and policies are continually under\nreview by the United States Congress, state   \nlegislatures and federal and state regulatory \nagencies. In addition to laws and regulations,\nstate and federal bank regulatory agencies may\nissue policy statements, interpretive letters \nand similar written guidance applicable to the\nCompany and its subsidiaries. Any change in   \nthe statutes, regulations or regulatory       \npolicies applicable to the Company, including \nchanges in their interpretation or            \nimplementation, could have a material effect  \non its business or organization.              \n                                              \nAs a BHC with over $100 billion in total      \nconsolidated assets, the Company is subject to\nthe Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s enhanced prudential      \nstandards, as applied to \u201cCategory III\u201d       \ninstitutions under the federal banking        \nregulators\u2019 rules that tailor how enhanced    \nprudential standards apply to large U.S.      \nbanking organizations (the \u201cTailoring Rules\u201d).\nThe Tailoring Rules also apply certain        \nenhanced prudential standards to our          \nsubsidiary depository institutions, USBNA and \nMUB, as described in more detail below.       \n                      8                       \nIn connection with the Company\u2019s acquisition  \nof MUB, the Company committed (the \u201cFederal   \nReserve Commitments\u201d) to submit to the Federal\nReserve quarterly implementation plans for    \ncomplying with requirements applicable to     \n\u201cCategory II\u201d institutions (i.e., institutions\nwith $700 billion or more in total assets or  \n$75 billion or more in cross-jurisdictional   \nactivities). The Company also committed to    \nmeet requirements applicable to Category II   \ninstitutions by the earlier of (i) the date   \nrequired under the Tailoring Rules; and (ii)  \nDecember 31, 2024, if the Federal Reserve     \nnotifies the Company by January 1, 2024, that \nthe Company must comply with such rules. As a \nCategory III institution, the Company must    \nconduct a company-run stress test every two   \nyears, and the Company is subject to reduced  \nLiquidity Coverage Ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d) and Net      \nStable Funding Ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) requirements    \nthat are calibrated at 85 percent of the full \nrequirements. Refer to \u201cStress Testing\u201d and   \n\u201cBasel III Liquidity Requirements\u201d below. If  \nthe Company becomes subject to requirements   \napplicable to Category II institutions, in    \naddition to the items discussed below, the    \nCompany will be required to conduct company-  \nrun stress tests on an annual basis and will  \nbecome subject to the full LCR and NSFR       \nrequirements. In addition, as a Category II   \ninstitution, the Company would be an \u201cadvanced\napproaches\u201d banking organization under the    \nFederal Reserve\u2019s current capital rules, which\nwould, among other things, introduce          \nsignificant additional complexity in the      \nmethodologies used to calculate the Company\u2019s \nrisk-weighted assets for purposes of          \ndetermining the Company\u2019s regulatory capital  \nratios.                                       \n                                              \nSupervisory Ratings Federal banking regulators\nregularly examine the Company and its insured \ndepository institution subsidiaries, USBNA and\nMUB. Following those exams, the Company (under\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s Large Financial         \nInstitution Rating System) and USBNA and MUB  \n(under the CAMELS rating system) are assigned \nsupervisory ratings. Disclosure of these      \nratings to third parties is not allowed       \nwithout permission of the issuing regulator. A\ndowngrade in these ratings could limit the    \nCompany\u2019s ability to pursue acquisitions or   \nconduct other expansionary activities for a   \nperiod of time, require new or additional     \nregulatory approvals before engaging in       \ncertain other business activities or          \ninvestments, affect USBNA\u2019s or MUB\u2019s deposit  \ninsurance assessment rates, and impose        \nadditional recordkeeping and corporate        \ngovernance requirements, as well as generally \nincrease regulatory scrutiny of the Company.  \n                                              \nBHC Activities The Company is a BHC under the \nBHC Act and has elected to be a financial     \nholding company (\u201cFHC\u201d). BHCs that qualify and\nelect to be treated as FHCs may engage in, and\naffiliate with financial companies engaging   \nin, a broader range of activities than would  \notherwise be permitted for a BHC.             \n                                              \nIf an FHC or a depository institution         \ncontrolled by an FHC ceases to be well-       \ncapitalized or well-managed, the Federal      \nReserve may impose corrective capital and     \nmanagerial requirements on the FHC and may    \nplace limitations on its ability to conduct   \nall of the business activities that FHCs are  \ngenerally permitted to conduct and its ability\nto make certain acquisitions. See \u201cPermissible\nBusiness Activities\u201d below. Disclosure of any \nfailure to meet these standards is not allowed\nwithout permission of the Federal Reserve. If \nthe failure to meet these standards persists, \nthe FHC may be required to divest its         \ndepository institution subsidiaries or cease  \nall activities other than those activities    \nthat may be conducted by BHCs that are not    \nFHCs. In addition, if a depository institution\ncontrolled by an FHC does not receive a       \nCommunity Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) rating of  \nat least \u201csatisfactory\u201d at its most recent    \nexamination, the Federal Reserve will prohibit\nthe FHC from conducting new business          \nactivities that FHCs are generally permitted  \nto conduct and from making certain            \nacquisitions.                                 \n                                              \nThe Federal Reserve also requires BHCs to meet\ncertain applicable capital and management     \nstandards. Failure by the Company to meet     \nthese standards could limit the Company from  \nengaging in any new activity or acquiring     \nother companies without the prior approval of \nthe Federal Reserve.                          \n                                              \nPermissible Business Activities As an FHC, the\nCompany may affiliate with securities firms   \nand insurance companies and engage in other   \nactivities that are financial in nature or    \nincidental or complementary to activities that\nare financial in nature. \u201cFinancial in nature\u201d\nactivities include securities underwriting,   \ndealing and market making; sponsoring mutual  \nfunds and investment companies; insurance     \nunderwriting and agency; merchant banking; and\nactivities that the Federal Reserve, in       \nconsultation with the Secretary of the United \nStates Treasury, determines to be financial in\nnature or incidental to such financial        \nactivity. \u201cComplementary activities\u201d are      \n                      9                       \nactivities that the Federal Reserve determines\nupon application to be complementary to a     \nfinancial activity and that do not pose a     \nsafety and soundness risk.                    \n                                              \nThe Company generally is not required to      \nobtain Federal Reserve approval to acquire a  \ncompany engaged in activities that are        \nfinancial in nature or incidental to          \nactivities that are financial in nature, as   \nlong as the Company meets the capital,        \nmanagerial and CRA requirements to qualify as \nan FHC. However, the Company is required to   \nreceive approval for an acquisition in which  \nthe total consolidated assets to be acquired  \nexceed $10 billion. FHCs are also required to \nobtain the approval of the Federal Reserve    \nbefore they may acquire more than five percent\nof the voting shares or substantially all of  \nthe assets of an unaffiliated BHC, bank or    \nsavings association. In addition, banks must  \nreceive approval before they may acquire,     \nmerge with, acquire substantially all of the  \nassets of or assume any deposits of a bank or \nsavings association and may be required to    \nreceive approval for acquisitions of other    \ncompanies.                                    \n                                              \nInterstate Banking A BHC may acquire banks in \nstates other than its home state, subject to  \nany state requirement that the bank has been  \norganized and operating for a minimum period  \nof time (not to exceed five years). Also, such\nan acquisition is not permitted if the BHC    \ncontrols, prior to or following the proposed  \nacquisition, more than 10 percent of the total\namount of deposits of insured depository      \ninstitutions nationwide, or, if the           \nacquisition is the BHC\u2019s initial entry into   \nthe state, more than 30 percent of the        \ndeposits of insured depository institutions in\nthe state (or any lesser or greater amount set\nby the state). Banks may merge across state   \nlines to create interstate branches and are   \npermitted to establish new branches in another\nstate to the same extent as banks chartered by\nthat state.                                   \n                                              \nRegulatory Approval for Acquisitions In       \ndetermining whether to approve a proposed bank\nacquisition, federal bank regulators will     \nconsider a number of factors, including the   \neffect of the acquisition on competition,     \nfinancial condition and future prospects      \n(including current and projected capital      \nratios and levels); the competence, experience\nand integrity of management and its record of \ncompliance with laws and regulations; the     \nconvenience and needs of the communities to be\nserved (including the acquiring institution\u2019s \nrecord of compliance under the CRA); the      \neffectiveness of the acquiring institution in \ncombating money laundering activities; and the\nextent to which the transaction would result  \nin greater or more concentrated risks to the  \nstability of the United States banking or     \nfinancial system. In addition, approval of    \ninterstate transactions requires that the     \nacquiror satisfy regulatory standards for     \nwell-capitalized and well-managed             \ninstitutions.                                 \n                                              \nIn July 2021, the current United States       \npresidential administration issued an         \nexecutive order on competition, which included\nprovisions relating to bank mergers. These    \nprovisions encourage the Department of Justice\nand the federal banking regulators to update  \nguidelines on banking mergers and to provide  \nmore scrutiny of bank mergers. The Company is \nunable to predict what impact the executive   \norder or any guidelines that the Department of\nJustice and federal banking regulators adopt  \nwill have on the timing of or ability to      \nobtain regulatory approvals of future mergers.\n                                              \nSource of StrengthThe Company is required to  \nact as a source of strength to USBNA and MUB, \nand to commit capital and financial resources \nto support these subsidiaries in circumstances\nwhere it might not otherwise do so. Under     \nthese requirements, the Federal Reserve may in\nthe future require the Company to provide     \nfinancial assistance to USBNA or MUB, should  \neither experience financial distress. Capital \nloans by the Company to USBNA or MUB would be \nsubordinate in right of payment to deposits   \nand certain other debts of USBNA or MUB, as   \napplicable.                                   \n                                              \nCross Guaranty Provisions The cross guaranty  \nprovisions in the Federal Deposit Insurance   \nAct require each insured depository           \ninstitution owned by the same BHC to be       \nfinancially responsible for the failure or    \nresolution costs of any affiliated insured    \ninstitution. Generally, the amount of the     \ncross guaranty liability is equal to the      \nestimated loss to the DIF for the resolution  \nof the affiliated institution(s) in default.  \nThe FDIC\u2019s claim under the cross guaranty     \nprovision is superior to claims of            \nshareholders of the insured depository        \ninstitution or its BHC and to most claims     \narising out of obligations or liabilities owed\nto affiliates of the institution, but is      \nsubordinate to                                \n                      10                      \nclaims of depositors, secured creditors and   \nholders of subordinated debt (other than      \naffiliates) of the commonly controlled insured\ndepository institution. The FDIC may decline  \nto enforce the cross guaranty provision if it \ndetermines that a waiver is in the best       \ninterest of the DIF.                          \n                                              \nOCC Heightened StandardsUSBNA and MUB are each\nsubject to the OCC\u2019s guidelines establishing  \nheightened standards for large national banks,\nwhich establish minimum standards for the     \ndesign and implementation of a risk governance\nframework for banks. The OCC may take action  \nagainst institutions that fail to meet these  \nstandards.                                    \n                                              \nEnhanced Prudential StandardsUnder the Dodd-  \nFrank Act, as modified by the Economic Growth,\nRegulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act \nand the Tailoring Rules, large bank holding   \ncompanies, such as the Company, are subject to\ncertain enhanced prudential standards based on\nthe banking organization\u2019s size and certain   \n\u201crisk-based indicators.\u201d The prudential       \nstandards include enhanced risk-based capital \nand leverage requirements, enhanced liquidity \nrequirements, enhanced risk management and    \nrisk committee requirements, a requirement to \nsubmit a resolution plan, single-counterparty \ncredit limits and stress tests. Certain of the\nenhanced prudential standards applicable to   \nthe Company are described below in further    \ndetail.                                       \n                                              \nDividend Restrictions The Company is a legal  \nentity separate and distinct from its         \nsubsidiaries. Typically, the majority of the  \nCompany\u2019s operating funds are received in the \nform of dividends paid to the Company by USBNA\nand MUB. Federal law imposes limitations on   \nthe payment of dividends by national banks. In\ngeneral, dividends payable by USBNA, MUB and  \nthe Company\u2019s trust bank subsidiaries, as     \nnational banking associations, are limited by \nrules that compare dividends to net income for\nperiods defined by regulation.                \n                                              \nThe OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC also\nhave authority to prohibit or limit the       \npayment of dividends by the banking           \norganizations they supervise (including the   \nCompany, USBNA and MUB) if, in the banking    \nregulator\u2019s opinion, payment of a dividend    \nwould constitute an unsafe or unsound practice\nin light of the financial condition of the    \nbanking organization.                         \n                                              \nIn addition, the Federal Reserve\u2019s final rule \nimplementing the stress capital buffer (\u201cSCB\u201d)\nprovides that a BHC must receive prior        \napproval for any dividend, stock repurchase or\nother capital distribution, other than a      \ncapital distribution on a newly issued capital\ninstrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit\nits capital plan. The rule also provides that \na BHC must resubmit its capital plan if, among\nother things, the BHC determines there has    \nbeen or will be a material change in the BHC\u2019s\nrisk profile, financial condition, or         \ncorporate structure since the BHC last        \nsubmitted its capital plan.                   \n                                              \nCapital Requirements The Company is subject to\ncertain regulatory risk-based capital and     \nleverage requirements under capital rules     \nadopted by the Federal Reserve, and USBNA and \nMUB are each subject to substantially similar \nrules adopted by the OCC. These rules         \nimplement the Basel Committee\u2019s framework for \nstrengthening the regulation, supervision and \nrisk management of banks (\u201cBasel III\u201d), as    \nwell as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank  \nAct. These quantitative calculations are      \nminimums, and the Federal Reserve and OCC may \ndetermine that a banking organization, based  \non its size, complexity or risk profile, must \nmaintain a higher level of capital in order to\noperate in a safe and sound manner.           \n                                              \nUnder the Tailoring Rules, the Company, USBNA \nand MUB are each currently subject to         \n\u201cCategory III\u201d standards, and are             \n\u201cstandardized approach\u201d banking organizations \nthat are subject to rules that provide for    \nsimplified capital requirements relating to   \nthe threshold deductions for mortgage         \nservicing assets, deferred tax assets arising \nfrom temporary differences that a banking     \norganization could not realize through net    \noperating loss carry backs, and investments in\nthe capital of unconsolidated financial       \ninstitutions, as well as the inclusion of     \nminority interests in regulatory capital.     \nGrowth in total consolidated assets (including\nassets obtained in acquisitions) or cross-    \njurisdictional activity (as defined in the    \nTailoring Rules) or action by the Federal     \nReserve in connection with the Federal Reserve\nCommitments could affect the Company\u2019s        \ncontinued classification as a \u201cCategory III\u201d  \ninstitution, which could result in the Company\nand its insured depository institution        \nsubsidiaries becoming \u201cadvanced approaches\u201d   \nbanking organizations, a requirement to       \nrecognize elements of accumulated other       \ncomprehensive income in regulatory capital, as\nwell as other more stringent capital,         \nliquidity, and other regulatory requirements. \n                      11                      \nUnder the United States Basel III-based       \ncapital rules, the Company is subject to a    \nminimum common equity tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) capital \nratio (CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets)  \nof 4.5 percent, a minimum tier 1 capital ratio\nof 6.0 percent and a minimum total capital    \nratio of 8.0 percent. The Company is also     \nsubject to the SCB, which is based on the     \nresults of the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory  \nstress tests and the Company\u2019s planned common \nstock dividends, and, if deployed by the      \nFederal Reserve, up to a 2.5 percent common   \nequity tier 1 countercyclical capital buffer. \nThese additional requirements must be         \nsatisfied entirely with capital that qualifies\nas CET1. Although the Federal Reserve has not \nto date raised the countercyclical capital    \nbuffer above zero percent, the countercyclical\ncapital buffer could change in the future. The\nSCB generally is assigned on an annual basis  \nand becomes effective on October 1 of each    \nyear, subject to a 2.5 percent floor, and may \nvary over time. As of December 31, 2022, the  \nSCB applicable to the Company is 2.5 percent. \nIf the Federal Reserve were to raise the      \ncountercyclical capital buffer, or if the SCB \napplicable to the Company were to exceed 2.5  \npercent, this would also change the effective \nminimum capital ratios to which the Company is\nsubject. For USBNA, the buffer requirement    \nconsists of the static capital conservation   \nbuffer equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. \n                                              \nBanking organizations that fail to meet the   \neffective minimum ratios will be subject to   \nconstraints on capital distributions,         \nincluding dividends and share repurchases, and\ncertain discretionary executive compensation, \nwith the severity of the constraints depending\non the extent of the shortfall and \u201celigible  \nretained income\u201d (defined as the greater of   \n(i) net income for the four preceding         \nquarters, net of distributions and associated \ntax effects not reflected in net income; and  \n(ii) the average of all net income over the   \npreceding four quarters).                     \n                                              \nUnited States banking organizations are also  \nsubject to a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of \n4.0 percent. As a Category III banking        \norganization, the Company is also subject to a\nminimum Supplementary Leverage Ratio (\u201cSLR\u201d)  \nof 3.0 percent that takes into account both   \non-balance sheet and certain off-balance sheet\nexposures. At December 31, 2022, the Company  \nexceeded the applicable minimum tier 1        \nleverage ratio and SLR requirements.          \n                                              \nIn December 2017, the Basel Committee         \nfinalized a package of revisions to the Basel \nIII framework. The changes are meant to       \nimprove the calculation of risk-weighted      \nassets (including by recalibrating risk       \nweights and introducing new capital           \nrequirements for certain \u201cunconditionally     \ncancellable commitments,\u201d including unused    \nlines of credit) and improve the comparability\nof capital ratios by (i) enhancing the        \nrobustness and risk sensitivity of the        \nstandardized approaches for credit risk,      \ncredit valuation adjustment (\u201cCVA\u201d) risk and  \noperational risk; (ii) constraining the use of\nthe internal model approaches, by placing     \nlimits on certain inputs used to calculate    \ncapital requirements under the internal       \nratings-based (\u201cIRB\u201d) approach for credit risk\nand by removing the use of the internal model \napproaches for CVA risk and for operational   \nrisk; (iii) introducing a leverage ratio      \nbuffer to further limit the leverage of global\nsystemically important banks; and (iv)        \nreplacing the existing Basel II output floor  \nwith a more robust risk-sensitive floor based \non the Committee\u2019s revised Basel III          \nstandardized approaches. In addition, in      \nJanuary 2019, the Basel Committee published a \nrevised market risk framework that, among     \nother things, revises the standardized        \napproach for market risk. The Basel framework \ncontemplated that these standards generally   \nwould be effective on January 1, 2023, with an\naggregate output floor phasing in through     \nJanuary 1, 2028. The federal bank regulators  \nhave not yet proposed rules implementing these\nstandards, and accordingly, the standards are \nnot yet in effect for United States banking   \norganizations. The effects of these revisions \non the Company and USBNA will depend on the   \nmanner in which they are implemented by the   \nUnited States federal banking agencies.       \n                                              \nIn 2020, the United States federal banking    \nagencies adopted a rule that allowed banking  \norganizations, including the Company and      \nUSBNA, to elect to delay temporarily the      \nestimated effects of adopting the current     \nexpected credit loss accounting standard      \n(\u201cCECL\u201d) on regulatory capital until January  \n2022 and subsequently to phase in the effects \nthrough January 2025. Through the 2022 stress \ntest cycle, the Federal Reserve has not yet   \nincorporated CECL into the calculation of the \nallowance for credit losses in supervisory    \nstress tests. For further discussion of CECL, \nsee Notes 1 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in the 2022 Annual       \nReport. The Company and USBNA elected to delay\nand subsequently phase in the regulatory      \ncapital impact of CECL in accordance with this\nrule.                                         \n                                              \nFor additional information regarding the      \nCompany\u2019s regulatory capital, see \u201cCapital    \nManagement\u201d in the 2022 Annual Report.        \n                      12                      \nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review As  \nrequired by the Federal Reserve\u2019s             \nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review     \n(\u201cCCAR\u201d) rules, the Company submits a capital \nplan to the Federal Reserve on an annual      \nbasis. As part of the CCAR process, the       \nFederal Reserve evaluates the Company\u2019s plans \nto make capital distributions, including by   \nrepurchasing stock or making dividend         \npayments, under a number of macroeconomic and \nCompany-specific assumptions based on the     \nCompany\u2019s and the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress    \ntests described under \u201cStress Testing\u201d below. \nThese capital plans consist of a number of    \nmandatory elements, including an assessment of\na company\u2019s sources and uses of capital over a\nnine-quarter planning horizon assuming both   \nexpected and stressful conditions; a detailed \ndescription of a company\u2019s process for        \nassessing capital adequacy; and a             \ndemonstration of a company\u2019s ability to       \nmaintain capital above each minimum regulatory\ncapital ratio (without taking the buffers into\naccount) under expected and stressful         \nconditions.                                   \n                                              \nStress Testing The Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR     \nframework and the Dodd-Frank Act stress       \ntesting framework require BHCs subject to     \nCategory III standards such as the Company to \nconduct an annual internal stress test in     \nconnection with its annual capital plan       \nsubmission as well as biennial company-run    \nstress tests, and subject such BHCs to annual \nsupervisory stress tests conducted by the     \nFederal Reserve. Among other things, the      \ncompany-run stress tests employ stress        \nscenarios developed by the Company as well as \nstress scenarios provided by the Federal      \nReserve and incorporate the Dodd-Frank Act    \ncapital actions (as opposed to the Company\u2019s  \nplanned capital actions), which are intended  \nto normalize capital distributions across     \nlarge United States bank holding companies.   \nThe Federal Reserve conducts CCAR and Dodd-   \nFrank Act supervisory stress tests employing  \nstress scenarios and internal supervisory     \nmodels and incorporates the Company\u2019s planned \ncapital actions and the Dodd-Frank Act capital\nactions, respectively, into its stress tests. \nThe Federal Reserve and the Company are       \ncurrently required to publish the results of  \nthe annual supervisory and biennial company-  \nrun stress tests, respectively, no later than \nJune 30 of each applicable year. If the       \nCompany were to become a \u201cCategory II\u201d        \ninstitution for purposes of the Tailoring     \nRules, whether as a result of growth in total \nconsolidated assets (including assets obtained\nin acquisitions) or cross-jurisdictional      \nactivity (as defined in the Tailoring Rules)  \nor action by the Federal Reserve in connection\nwith the Federal Reserve Commitments, the     \nCompany would become subject to annual (rather\nthan biennial) company-run stress tests.      \n                                              \nUnder the OCC\u2019s rules, national banks with    \nassets in excess of $250 billion, including   \nUSBNA, are required to submit company-run     \nstress test results to the OCC concurrently   \nwith their parent BHC\u2019s CCAR submission to the\nFederal Reserve. The stress test is based on  \nthe OCC\u2019s stress scenarios (which are         \ntypically the same as the Federal Reserve\u2019s   \nstress scenarios) and capital actions that are\nappropriate for the economic conditions       \nassumed in each scenario.                     \n                                              \nBasel III Liquidity Requirements As a Category\nIII banking organization, the Company, USBNA  \nand MUB are each subject to a minimum LCR     \nunder the Tailoring Rules. The LCR is designed\nto ensure that BHCs have sufficient high-     \nquality liquid assets to survive a significant\nliquidity stress event lasting for 30 calendar\ndays. In addition, the Company, USBNA and MUB \nare subject to the NSFR rule, which is        \ndesigned to promote stable, longer-term       \nfunding of assets and business activities over\na one-year time horizon. Under the Tailoring  \nRules and NSFR rule, the Company, USBNA and   \nMUB as Category III banking organizations with\nless than $75 billion of weighted short-term  \nwholesale funding, qualify for reduced LCR and\nNSFR requirements calibrated at 85 percent of \nthe full requirements. If the Company were to \nbecome a \u201cCategory II\u201d institution for        \npurposes of the Tailoring Rules, whether as a \nresult of growth in total consolidated assets \n(including assets obtained in acquisitions) or\ncross-jurisdictional activity (as defined in  \nthe Tailoring Rules) or action by the Federal \nReserve in connection with the Federal Reserve\nCommitments, the Company would become subject \nto the full (100 percent) LCR and NSFR        \nrequirements, as well as daily (rather than   \nmonthly) liquidity reporting requirements.    \n                                              \nPrompt Corrective Action The Federal Deposit  \nInsurance Corporation Improvement Act         \n(\u201cFDICIA\u201d) provides a framework for regulation\nof depository institutions and their          \naffiliates (including parent holding          \ncompanies) by federal banking regulators. As  \npart of that framework, the FDICIA requires   \nthe relevant federal banking regulator to take\n\u201cprompt corrective action\u201d with respect to an \nFDIC-insured depository institution, such as  \nUSBNA or MUB, if that institution does not    \nmeet certain capital adequacy standards.      \nSupervisory actions by                        \n                      13                      \nthe appropriate federal banking regulator     \nunder the \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d rules    \ngenerally depend upon an institution\u2019s        \nclassification within five capital categories.\nAn institution that fails to remain well-     \ncapitalized becomes subject to a series of    \nrestrictions that increase in severity as its \ncapital condition weakens. Such restrictions  \nmay include a prohibition on capital          \ndistributions, restrictions on asset growth or\nrestrictions on the ability to receive        \nregulatory approval of applications. The      \nFDICIA also provides for enhanced supervisory \nauthority over undercapitalized institutions, \nincluding authority for the appointment of a  \nconservator or receiver for the institution.  \n                                              \nPrompt corrective action regulations apply    \nonly to banks and not to BHCs such as the     \nCompany. However, the Federal Reserve is      \nauthorized to take appropriate action at the  \nBHC level, based on the undercapitalized      \nstatus of the BHC\u2019s subsidiary banking        \ninstitutions. In certain instances, relating  \nto an undercapitalized bank, the BHC would be \nrequired to guarantee the performance of the  \nundercapitalized subsidiary\u2019s capital         \nrestoration plan and could be liable for civil\nmoney damages for failure to fulfill those    \nguarantee commitments.                        \n                                              \nDeposit Insurance The DIF provides insurance  \ncoverage for certain deposits, up to a        \nstandard maximum deposit insurance amount of  \n$250,000 per depositor. Deposits at USBNA and \nMUB are insured up to the applicable limits.  \nThe DIF is funded through assessments on      \ninsured depository institutions, including    \nUSBNA and MUB, based on the risk each         \ninstitution poses to the DIF. The FDIC may    \nincrease USBNA\u2019s or MUB\u2019s insurance premiums  \nbased on various factors, including the FDIC\u2019s\nassessment of its risk profile.               \n                                              \nIn addition, large insured depository         \ninstitutions, including USBNA, are subject to \nenhanced deposit account recordkeeping and    \nrelated information technology system         \nrequirements meant to facilitate prompt       \npayment of insured deposits if such an        \ninstitution were to fail.                     \n                                              \nIn October 2022, the FDIC finalized a rule to \nincrease the initial base deposit insurance   \nassessment rate schedules for all insured     \ndepository institutions by two basis points,  \nbeginning with the first quarterly assessment \nperiod of 2023. The increased assessment rate \nis intended to improve the likelihood that the\nDIF reserve ratio would reach the required    \nminimum of 1.35 percent by the statutory      \ndeadline of September 30, 2028.               \n                                              \nDepositor Preference Under federal law, in the\nevent of the liquidation or other resolution  \nof an insured depository institution, the     \nclaims of a receiver of the institution for   \nadministrative expense and the claims of      \nholders of domestic deposit liabilities have  \npriority over the claims of other unsecured   \ncreditors of the institution, including       \nholders of publicly issued senior or          \nsubordinated debt and depositors in non-      \ndomestic offices. As a result, those          \ndebtholders and depositors would be treated   \ndifferently from, and could receive, if       \nanything, substantially less than, the        \ndepositors in domestic offices of the         \ndepository institution.                       \n                                              \nOrderly Liquidation Authority Upon the        \ninsolvency of a BHC, such as the Company, the \nFDIC may be appointed as conservator or       \nreceiver of the BHC if the Secretary of the   \nTreasury determines (upon the written         \nrecommendation of the FDIC and the Federal    \nReserve and after consultation with the       \nPresident of the United States) that certain  \nconditions set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act    \nregarding the potential impact on financial   \nstability of a financial company\u2019s failure    \nhave been met. FDIC rules set forth a         \ncomprehensive method for the receivership of a\ncovered financial company. Acting as a        \nconservator or receiver, the FDIC would have  \nbroad powers to transfer any assets or        \nliabilities of a BHC without the approval of  \nits creditors.                                \n                                              \nResolution PlansThe Company is required by the\nFederal Reserve and the FDIC to submit a      \nperiodic plan for the rapid and orderly       \nresolution of the Company and its significant \nlegal entities in the event of future material\nfinancial distress or failure. If the Federal \nReserve and the FDIC jointly determine that   \nthe resolution plan is not credible and such  \ndeficiencies are not cured in a timely manner,\nthe regulators may jointly impose on the      \nCompany more stringent capital, leverage or   \nliquidity requirements or restrictions on the \nCompany\u2019s growth, activities or operations. If\nthe Company were to fail to address the       \ndeficiencies in its resolution plan when      \nrequired, it could eventually be required to  \ndivest certain assets or operations. As a     \nCategory III banking organization, the Company\nis required to submit resolution plans on a   \ntriennial cycle (alternating between          \n                      14                      \ntargeted and full submissions). In December   \n2020, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC        \nreleased targeted plan guidance and directed  \nlarge foreign and domestic banks to file      \nresolution plans including core elements of a \nfirm\u2019s resolution strategy as well as how each\nfirm has integrated changes to and lessons    \nlearned from its response to COVID-19 into its\nresolution planning process. The Company      \nsubmitted its targeted resolution plan in     \nDecember 2021 and is scheduled to file its    \nnext full resolution plan in July 2024. Under \nthe Federal Reserve Commitments, the Company  \nhas committed to the Federal Reserve that it  \nwill, within six months of completing the     \nacquisition of MUB, provide the Federal       \nReserve and the FDIC with an interim update to\nits resolution plan.                          \n                                              \nIn September 2022, the Federal Reserve and the\nFDIC announced the development of new         \nresolution plan guidance for Category II and  \nCategory III banking organizations but that   \nagencies will seek and consider public comment\nprior to finalizing the guidance. The Company \nexpects to be subject to the final guidance.  \nIn addition, USBNA and MUB are required to    \nfile periodically separate resolution plans   \nwith the FDIC that should enable the FDIC, as \nreceiver, to resolve each institution under   \napplicable receivership provisions of the     \nFederal Deposit Insurance Act in a manner that\nensures that depositors receive access to     \ntheir insured deposits within one business day\nof the institution\u2019s failure, maximizes the   \nnet present value return from the sale or     \ndisposition of its assets and minimizes the   \namount of any loss to the institution\u2019s       \ncreditors. In June 2021, the FDIC issued a    \nStatement on Resolution Plans for Insured     \nDepository Institutions (the \u201cFDIC            \nStatement\u201d). Among other things, the FDIC     \nStatement established a three-year filing     \ncycle for banks with $100 billion or more in  \ntotal assets and provided details regarding   \nthe content that filers will be expected to   \nprepare. Under this filing cycle, USBNA and   \nMUB each submitted its most recent resolution \nplan to the FDIC in November 2022.            \n                                              \nIn addition, in connection with the approval  \nby the OCC of the merger of MUB into USBNA,   \nUSBNA committed (the \u201cOCC Commitments\u201d) to the\nOCC that it would (i) develop a list of       \nbusiness lines and/or portfolios (each an     \n\u201cobject of sale\u201d) that could be sold quickly  \nin the event of stress; and (ii) prepare a    \nplan, including a timeline, to effectuate such\nseparability, including through the           \nestablishment of \u201cdata rooms\u201d for each object \nof sale. Within six months of consummation of \nthe merger of MUB into USBNA, USBNA must      \nsubmit these items to the OCC for a written   \ndetermination of no supervisory objection.    \n                                              \nRecovery Plans The OCC has established        \nenforceable guidelines for recovery planning  \nby insured national banks with average total  \nconsolidated assets of $250 billion or more,  \nincluding USBNA. The guidelines provide that a\ncovered bank should develop and maintain a    \nrecovery plan that is appropriate for its     \nindividual risk profile, size, activities, and\ncomplexity, including the complexity of its   \norganizational and legal entity structure. The\nguidelines state that a recovery plan should, \namong other elements, (i) establish triggers, \nwhich are quantitative or qualitative         \nindicators of the risk or existence of severe \nstress that should always be escalated to     \nmanagement or the board of directors, as      \nappropriate, for purposes of initiating a     \nresponse; (ii) identify a wide range of       \ncredible options that a covered bank could    \nundertake to restore financial and operational\nstrength and viability; and (iii) address     \nescalation procedures, management reports, and\ncommunication procedures. USBNA\u2019s recovery    \nplan was reviewed and approved pursuant to    \nthese guidelines in December 2022.            \n                                              \nTransactions with Affiliates There are various\nlegal restrictions on the extent to which the \nCompany and its non-bank subsidiaries may     \nborrow or otherwise engage in certain types of\ntransactions with USBNA, MUB or their         \nrespective subsidiaries. Under the Federal    \nReserve Act and the Federal Reserve\u2019s         \nRegulation W, USBNA, MUB and their respective \nsubsidiaries are subject to quantitative and  \nqualitative limits on extensions of credit    \n(including credit exposure arising from       \nrepurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, \nsecurities borrowing and derivative           \ntransactions), purchases of assets, and       \ncertain other transactions with the Company or\nits other non-bank subsidiaries and           \naffiliates. Additionally, transactions between\nUSBNA, MUB or their respective subsidiaries,  \non the one hand, and the Company or its other \nnon-bank subsidiaries and affiliates, on the  \nother hand, are required to be on arm\u2019s length\nterms. Transactions between either USBNA or   \nMUB and their affiliates must be consistent   \nwith standards of safety and soundness.       \n                                              \nAnti-Money Laundering and Sanctions The       \nCompany is subject to several federal laws    \nthat are designed to combat money laundering  \nand terrorist financing, and to restrict      \ntransactions with persons, companies, or      \nforeign governments sanctioned by United      \nStates authorities. This category of laws     \nincludes the Bank Secrecy Act (the            \n                      15                      \n\u201cBSA\u201d), the Money Laundering Control Act, the \nUSA PATRIOT Act (collectively, \u201cAML laws\u201d),   \nand implementing regulations for the          \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act   \nand the Trading with the Enemy Act, as        \nadministered by the United States Treasury    \nDepartment\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control \n(\u201csanctions laws\u201d).                           \n                                              \nAs implemented by federal banking and         \nsecurities regulators and the Department of   \nthe Treasury, AML laws obligate depository    \ninstitutions and broker-dealers to verify     \ntheir customers\u2019 identity, verify the identity\nof beneficial owners of legal entity          \ncustomers, conduct customer due diligence,    \nreport on suspicious activity, file reports of\ncertain transactions in currency, and conduct \nenhanced due diligence on certain accounts.   \nSanctions laws prohibit United States persons \nand certain foreign affiliates from engaging  \nin any transaction with a restricted person or\nrestricted country. Depository institutions   \nand broker-dealers are required by their      \nrespective federal regulators to maintain     \npolicies and procedures in order to ensure    \ncompliance with the above obligations. Federal\nregulators regularly examine BSA/Anti-Money   \nLaundering (\u201cAML\u201d) and sanctions compliance   \nprograms to ensure their adequacy and         \neffectiveness, and the frequency and extent of\nsuch examinations and related remedial actions\nhave been increasing.                         \n                                              \nIn January 2021, the Anti-Money Laundering Act\nof 2020 (\u201cAMLA\u201d), which amends the BSA, was   \nenacted. Among other things, the AMLA codified\na risk-based approach to anti-money laundering\ncompliance for financial institutions;        \nrequired the development of standards by the  \nU.S. Department of the Treasury for evaluating\ntechnology and internal processes for BSA     \ncompliance; and expanded enforcement- and     \ninvestigation-related authority, including a  \nsignificant expansion in the available        \nsanctions for certain BSA violations. Many of \nthe statutory provisions in the AMLA will     \nrequire additional rulemakings, reports and   \nother measures, and the impact of the AMLA    \nwill depend on, among other things, rulemaking\nand implementation guidance. In June 2021, the\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau\nof the U.S. Department of the Treasury, issued\nthe priorities for anti-money laundering and  \ncountering the financing of terrorism policy  \nrequired under the AMLA. The priorities       \ninclude corruption, cybercrime, terrorist     \nfinancing, fraud, transnational crime, drug   \ntrafficking, human trafficking and            \nproliferation financing.                      \n                                              \nCommunity Reinvestment Act USBNA and MUB are  \nsubject to the provisions of the CRA. Under   \nthe terms of the CRA, banks have a continuing \nand affirmative obligation, consistent with   \nsafe and sound operation, to help meet the    \ncredit needs of their communities, including  \nproviding credit to individuals residing in   \nlow- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The   \nOCC assesses USBNA and MUB on their record in \nmeeting the credit needs of the community     \nserved by that institution, including low- and\nmoderate-income neighborhoods. CRA assessments\nalso are considered by the Federal Reserve or \nOCC when reviewing applications by banking    \ninstitutions to acquire, merge or consolidate \nwith another banking institution or its       \nholding company, to establish a new branch    \noffice that will accept deposits, or to       \nrelocate an office. In the case of a BHC      \napplying for approval to acquire a bank or    \nother BHC, the Federal Reserve will assess the\nCRA records of each subsidiary depository     \ninstitution of the applicant BHC, and those   \nrecords may be the basis for denying the      \napplication. USBNA received an \u201cOutstanding\u201d  \nCRA rating in its most recent examination,    \ncovering the period from January 1, 2016      \nthrough December 31, 2020. MUB received an    \n\u201cOutstanding\u201d CRA rating in its most recent   \nexamination, covering the period from January \n1, 2015 through December 31, 2018.            \n                                              \nIn May 2022, the OCC, together with the       \nFederal Reserve and FDIC, issued a joint      \nnotice of proposed rulemaking to modernize the\nCRA regulatory framework. The proposed rule is\nintended, among other things, to adapt to     \nchanges in the banking industry, including the\nexpanded role of mobile and online banking,   \nand to tailor performance standards to account\nfor differences in bank size and business     \nmodels. The proposed rule would adjust CRA    \nevaluations based on bank size and type, with \nmany of the proposed changes applying only to \nbanks with over $2 billion in assets and      \nseveral applying only to banks with over $10  \nbillion in assets, such as USBNA and MUB. The \neffects of the proposed CRA rules on USBNA and\nMUB will depend on the final form of any      \nrulemaking.                                   \n                                              \nRegulation of Brokerage, Investment Advisory  \nand Insurance Activities The Company conducts \na broad range of securities activities, both  \nretail and institutional, in the United States\nthrough U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., PFM   \nFund Distributors, Inc. and UnionBanc         \nInvestment Services LLC (\u201cbroker-dealer       \nentities\u201d). These                             \n                      16                      \nactivities are subject to regulations of the  \nSEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory        \nAuthority and other authorities, including    \nstate regulators. These regulations generally \ncover licensing of securities personnel,      \ninteractions with customers and               \ncounterparties, trading operations, customer  \nsuitability and communications. Securities    \nregulators impose capital requirements on the \nCompany\u2019s broker-dealer entities and          \nperiodically review their sales practice and  \nfinancial operations. In addition, the        \nCompany\u2019s broker-dealer entities are members  \nof the Securities Investor Protection         \nCorporation, which oversees the liquidation of\nmember broker-dealers that close when the     \nbroker-dealer is bankrupt or in financial     \ntrouble and imposes membership fee assessments\nand other reporting requirements on the       \nbroker-dealer entities.                       \n                                              \nThe operations of the First American family of\nfunds, the Company\u2019s proprietary money market \nfund complex, also are subject to regulation  \nby the SEC, including rules requiring a       \nfloating net asset value for institutional    \nprime and tax-free money market funds and     \npermitting the board of directors of the money\nmarket funds the ability to limit redemptions \nduring periods of stress (allowing for the use\nof liquidity fees and redemption gates during \nsuch times). In December 2021, the SEC        \nproposed amendments to the rules that govern  \nmoney market funds. The proposed amendments,  \nif implemented, may affect the operations of  \nthe funds, in particular, institutional prime \nand tax-exempt money market funds.            \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s operations in the areas of      \ninsurance brokerage and reinsurance of credit \nlife insurance are subject to regulation and  \nsupervision by various state insurance        \nregulatory authorities, including the         \nlicensing of insurance brokers and agents.    \n                                              \nRegulation of Derivatives and the Swaps       \nMarketplace Under the Dodd-Frank Act, USBNA,  \nas a CFTC provisionally-registered swap       \ndealer, is subject to rules regarding the     \nregulation of the swaps marketplace and over- \nthe-counter derivatives, including rules that \nrequire swap dealers and major swap           \nparticipants to register with the CFTC, to    \nmeet robust business conduct standards to     \nlower risk and promote market integrity, to   \nmeet certain recordkeeping and reporting      \nrequirements so that regulators can better    \nmonitor the markets, to centrally clear and   \ntrade swaps on regulated exchanges or         \nexecution facilities, and to be subject to    \ncertain capital and margin requirements.      \n                                              \nIn addition, the OCC\u2019s rules concerning swap  \nmargin and capital requirements for swap      \ndealers regulated by the OCC mandate the      \nexchange of initial and variation margin for  \nnon-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-   \nbased swaps between swap entities regulated by\nthe five agencies and certain counterparties. \nThe amount of margin will vary based on the   \nrelative risk of the non-cleared swap or non- \ncleared security-based swap. Other rules      \ngenerally exempt inter-affiliate transactions \nfrom initial margin requirements to the extent\na depository institution\u2019s total exposure to  \nall affiliates is less than 15 percent of its \ntier 1 capital.                               \n                                              \nThe Volcker Rule Section 13 of the BHC Act and\nits implementing regulations, commonly        \nreferred to as the \u201cVolcker Rule,\u201d prohibit   \nbanking entities from engaging in proprietary \ntrading, and prohibit certain interests in, or\nrelationships with, hedge funds or private    \nequity funds. The Volcker Rule applies to the \nCompany, USBNA, MUB and their affiliates, and \ncompliance requirements are tailored based on \nthe size and scope of trading activities. The \nCompany has a Volcker Rule compliance program \nin place that covers all of its subsidiaries  \nand affiliates, including USBNA and MUB.      \n                                              \nPrivacy and Data Protection Federal and state \nlaw contains extensive consumer privacy and   \ndata protection provisions. The Gramm Leach-  \nBliley Act (\u201cGLBA\u201d) requires financial        \ninstitutions to periodically disclose their   \nprivacy policies and practices relating to    \nsharing nonpublic personal information and    \nenables retail customers to opt out of the    \nsharing of such information with nonaffiliated\nthird parties under certain circumstances.    \nOther federal and state laws and regulations  \nimpact the Company\u2019s ability to share certain \ninformation with affiliates and non-affiliates\nfor marketing and/or non-marketing purposes,  \nor to contact customers with marketing offers.\nThe GLBA also requires financial institutions \nto implement a comprehensive information      \nsecurity program. Security and privacy        \npolicies and procedures for the protection of \npersonal and confidential information are in  \neffect across all the Company\u2019s businesses and\ngeographic locations.                         \n                                              \nData privacy and data protection are areas of \nincreasing state legislative focus, and       \nseveral U.S. states have recently enacted     \ncomprehensive consumer privacy laws that      \nimpose compliance obligations with respect to \npersonal information. For example, the Company\nis subject to the California Consumer         \nProtection Act of 2018                        \n                      17                      \nand its implementing regulations              \n(collectively, the \u201cCCPA\u201d). The CCPA gives    \nconsumers several rights with respect to their\npersonal information, including the right to  \n(i) know the information that has been        \ncollected about them and whether that         \ninformation has been sold or shared with      \nothers; (ii) request deletion of their        \npersonal information (subject to certain      \nexceptions); (iii) opt out of the sale of     \ntheir personal information; and (iv) not be   \ndiscriminated against for exercising these    \nrights. The CCPA contains several exemptions  \nto the CCPA\u2019s requirements, including an      \nexemption for personal information that is    \nsubject to the GLBA. The CCPA also provides   \nresidents of California (regardless of whether\ntheir information is covered under the GLBA   \nexemption) with a limited private right of    \naction, including the right to seek statutory \ndamages, against businesses that fail to      \nimplement and maintain reasonable security    \nprocedures and practices and the failure      \nresults in the unauthorized access and        \nexfiltration, theft, or disclosure of certain \ntypes of the California residents\u2019 personal   \ninformation. In November 2020, voters in the  \nState of California approved the California   \nPrivacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), a ballot measure \nthat amends and supplements the CCPA by, among\nother things, expanding certain rights        \nrelating to personal information and its use, \ncollection, and disclosure by covered         \nbusinesses. While the CPRA\u2019s substantive      \namendments to the CCPA took effect on January \n1, 2023, the process of providing implementing\nregulations for those amendments is ongoing,  \nwith finalized regulations not expected until \nmonths after the amendments\u2019 effective date.  \nIn addition, similar laws have been adopted by\nother states where the Company does business, \nincluding the Colorado Privacy Act, the       \nConnecticut Act Concerning Personal Data      \nPrivacy and Online Monitoring of 2022, the    \nUtah Consumer Privacy Act and the Virginia    \nConsumer Data Protection Act. Each of these   \nstate laws, however, includes an entity level \nexemption for \u201cfinancial institutions\u201d like   \nthe Company. The Company has made and will    \nmake operational adjustments in accordance    \nwith the requirements of applicable privacy   \nand data protection laws. The United States   \nCongress has also proposed legislation        \nrelating to data privacy and data protection, \nand the federal government may in the future  \npass such legislation. In addition, in the    \nEuropean Union (\u201cEU\u201d), privacy law is governed\nby the General Data Protection Regulation     \n(\u201cGDPR\u201d), which is directly binding and       \napplicable in each EU member state. The GDPR  \ncontains enhanced compliance obligations and  \nincreased penalties for non-compliance        \ncompared to the prior law governing data      \nprivacy in the EU and is regularly enforced by\nEuropean regulators.                          \n                                              \nLike other lenders, USBNA, MUB and other      \nsubsidiaries of the Company use consumer      \nreports in their underwriting activities. Use \nof such information is regulated under the    \nFair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d), and the   \nFCRA also regulates reporting information to  \nconsumer reporting agencies, prescreening     \nindividuals for credit offers, sharing of     \nconsumer reports between affiliates, and using\naffiliate credit data for marketing purposes. \nSimilar state laws may impose additional      \nrequirements on the Company and its           \nsubsidiaries.                                 \n                                              \nThe federal banking regulators, as well as the\nSEC, CFPB, CFTC, and related self-regulatory  \norganizations, regularly issue guidance on    \ncybersecurity that is intended to enhance     \ncyber risk management among financial         \ninstitutions. A financial institution\u2019s       \nmanagement is required to maintain sufficient \nbusiness continuity planning processes to     \nensure the rapid recovery, resumption and     \nmaintenance of the institution\u2019s operations   \nafter a cybersecurity incident. A financial   \ninstitution is also expected to develop       \nappropriate processes to enable recovery of   \ndata and business operations if the           \ninstitution or its critical service providers \nexperience a cybersecurity incident.          \n                                              \nIn November 2021, the United States federal   \nbank regulatory agencies adopted a rule       \nregarding notification requirements for       \nbanking organizations related to significant  \ncomputer security incidents. Under the final  \nrule, which was effective April 1, 2022, a    \nBHC, such as the Company, and a national bank,\nsuch as USBNA or MUB, is required to notify   \nthe Federal Reserve or OCC, respectively,     \nwithin 36 hours of a computer security        \nincident that results in actual harm to the   \nconfidentiality, integrity or availability of \nan information system or the information that \nthe system processes, stores or transmits,    \nwhich has materially disrupted or degraded, or\nis reasonably likely to materially disrupt or \ndegrade, the banking organization\u2019s ability to\ndeliver services to a material portion of its \ncustomer base, jeopardize the viability of key\noperations of the banking organization, or    \nimpact the stability of the financial sector. \nSimilarly, the Office of the Superintendent of\nFinancial Institutions in Canada requires     \nFederally Regulated Financial Institutions to \nreport qualifying technology and cybersecurity\nincidents under the provisions of the August  \n13, 2021 Technology and Cyber Security        \nIncident Reporting Advisory.                  \n                      18                      \nConsumer Protection USBNA\u2019s and MUB\u2019s retail  \nbanking activities are subject to a variety of\nfederal and state statutes and regulations    \ndesigned to protect consumers. These laws and \nregulations require, among other things,      \ndisclosures of the cost of credit and terms of\ndeposit accounts, provide substantive consumer\nrights, prohibit discrimination in credit     \ntransactions, regulate the use of credit      \nreport information, provide financial privacy \nprotections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and   \nabusive practices and subject USBNA and MUB to\nsubstantial regulatory oversight. Violations  \nof applicable consumer protection laws can    \nresult in significant potential liability from\nlitigation brought by customers, including    \nactual damages, restitution and attorneys\u2019    \nfees, and may also result in significant      \nreputational harm. USBNA\u2019s and MUB\u2019s          \nregulators may also seek to enforce consumer  \nprotection requirements and obtain these and  \nother remedies, including regulatory sanctions\nand civil money penalties.                    \n                                              \nUSBNA, MUB and their respective subsidiaries  \nare subject to supervision and regulation by  \nthe CFPB with respect to federal consumer     \nlaws. The CFPB has undertaken numerous rule-  \nmaking and other initiatives, including       \nlaunching an initiative to reduce the amounts \nand types of fees financial institutions may  \ncharge, including by recently proposing a rule\nthat would significantly reduce the           \npermissible amount of credit card late fees,  \nissuing informal guidance and taking          \nenforcement actions against certain financial \ninstitutions. The CFPB\u2019s rulemaking,          \nexamination and enforcement authority has     \naffected and will continue to affect financial\ninstitutions that provide consumer financial  \nproducts and services, including the Company, \nUSBNA, MUB and the Company\u2019s other            \nsubsidiaries. These regulatory activities may \nlimit the types of financial services and     \nproducts the Company may offer, which in turn \nmay reduce the Company\u2019s revenues.            \n                                              \nLIBOR ActIn March 2022, the Adjustable        \nInterest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the \u201cLIBOR Act\u201d)   \nwas enacted. The LIBOR Act provides a uniform \napproach for replacing LIBOR as a reference   \ninterest rate in certain LIBOR-linked         \ncontracts for a time when LIBOR is no longer  \npublished or is no longer representative. The \nLIBOR Act covers contracts that either do not \ninclude effective fallback provisions, for    \nexample, because they have no provisions for a\nreplacement benchmark or provisions based on  \nprior LIBOR values or dealer polls, or permit \na party to select a replacement benchmark in  \nits discretion. Under the LIBOR Act,          \nreferences to the most common tenors of LIBOR \nin these contracts will be replaced as a      \nmatter of law, without the need to be amended \nby the parties, to instead reference a        \nbenchmark interest rate identified in Federal \nReserve regulations that is based on the      \nsecured overnight funding rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). In   \nDecember 2022, the Federal Reserve issued     \nfinal regulations to implement the LIBOR Act. \nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s final rule identified   \nbenchmark replacements, based on SOFR, for    \nvarious types of contracts subject to the     \nLIBOR Act. The Company continues to evaluate  \nthe effect of the LIBOR Act and its           \nimplementing regulations on the Company\u2019s     \nLIBOR-linked contracts. See the section       \nentitled \u201cLIBOR Transition\u201d of the Company\u2019s  \n2022 Annual Report for additional information \nregarding the Company\u2019s efforts to transition \naway from LIBOR.                              \n                                              \nExecutive and Incentive Compensation          \nGuidelines adopted by the federal banking     \nagencies prohibit excessive compensation as an\nunsafe and unsound practice and describe      \ncompensation as \u201cexcessive\u201d when the amounts  \npaid are unreasonable or disproportionate to  \nthe services performed by an executive        \nofficer, employee, director or principal      \nstockholder. The Federal Reserve has issued   \ncomprehensive guidance on incentive           \ncompensation policies (the \u201cIncentive         \nCompensation Guidance\u201d) intended to ensure    \nthat the incentive compensation policies of   \nbanking organizations do not undermine safety \nand soundness organizations by encouraging    \nexcessive risk-taking. The Incentive          \nCompensation Guidance is based upon the key   \nprinciples that a banking organization\u2019s      \nincentive compensation arrangements should (i)\nprovide incentives that do not encourage risk-\ntaking beyond the organization\u2019s ability to   \neffectively identify and manage risks; (ii) be\ncompatible with effective internal controls   \nand risk management; and (iii) be supported by\nstrong corporate governance, including active \nand effective oversight by the organization\u2019s \nboard of directors. The Incentive Compensation\nGuidance states that enforcement actions may  \nbe taken against a banking organization if its\nincentive compensation arrangements or related\nrisk-management control or governance         \nprocesses pose a risk to the organization\u2019s   \nsafety and soundness and the organization is  \nnot taking prompt and effective measures to   \ncorrect the deficiencies.                     \n                                              \nDuring 2016, the federal bank regulatory      \nagencies and the SEC proposed revised rules on\nincentive-based payment arrangements at       \nspecified regulated entities having at least  \n$1 billion of total assets. These proposed    \nrules have not been finalized.                \n                      19                      \nIn October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule \ndirecting national securities exchanges and   \nassociations, including the New York Stock    \nExchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d), to implement listing   \nstandards that require all listed companies to\nadopt policies mandating the recovery or      \n\u201cclawback\u201d of excess incentive-based          \ncompensation earned by a current or former    \nexecutive officer during the three fiscal     \nyears preceding a required accounting         \nrestatement, including to correct an error    \nthat would result in a material misstatement  \nif the error were corrected in the current    \nperiod. The excess compensation would be based\non the amount the executive officer would have\nreceived had the incentive-based compensation \nbeen determined using the restated financial  \nstatements. The final rule requires the       \nexchanges to propose conforming listing       \nstandards by February 26, 2023, and requires  \nthe standards to become effective no later    \nthan November 23, 2023. Each listed issuer,   \nincluding the Company, would then be required \nto adopt a clawback policy within 60 days     \nafter its exchange\u2019s listing standard has     \nbecome effective.                             \n                                              \nOther Supervision and Regulation The Company  \nis subject to the disclosure and regulatory   \nrequirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, and the Securities Exchange Act of   \n1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), both as\nadministered by the SEC, by virtue of the     \nCompany\u2019s status as a public company. As a    \nlisted company on the NYSE, the Company is    \nsubject to the rules of the NYSE for listed   \ncompanies.                                    \n                                              \nCapital Covenants                             \n                                              \nThe Company has entered into several          \ntransactions involving the issuance of capital\nsecurities (\u201cCapital Securities\u201d) by certain  \nDelaware statutory trusts formed by the       \nCompany (the \u201cTrusts\u201d), the issuance by the   \nCompany of preferred stock (\u201cPreferred Stock\u201d)\nor the issuance by a subsidiary of USBNA of   \npreferred stock exchangeable for the Company\u2019s\nPreferred Stock under certain circumstances   \n(\u201cExchangeable Preferred Stock\u201d).             \nSimultaneously with the closing of certain of \nthose transactions, the Company entered into a\nreplacement capital covenant, as amended from \ntime to time (as amended, each, a \u201cReplacement\nCapital Covenant\u201d and collectively, the       \n\u201cReplacement Capital Covenants\u201d) for the      \nbenefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a   \nspecified series of long-term indebtedness of \nthe Company or USBNA (the \u201cCovered Debt\u201d).    \nEach of the Replacement Capital Covenants     \nprovides that neither the Company nor any of  \nits subsidiaries (including any of the Trusts)\nwill repay, redeem or purchase any of the     \nPreferred Stock, Exchangeable Preferred Stock \nor the Capital Securities and the securities  \nheld by the Trust (the \u201cOther Securities\u201d), as\napplicable, on or before the date specified in\nthe applicable Replacement Capital Covenant,  \nunless the Company has received proceeds from \nthe sale of qualifying securities that (a)    \nhave equity-like characteristics that are the \nsame as, or more equity-like than, the        \napplicable characteristics of the Preferred   \nStock, the Exchangeable Preferred Stock, the  \nCapital Securities or Other Securities, as    \napplicable, at the time of repayment,         \nredemption or purchase, and (b) the Company   \nhas obtained the prior approval of the Federal\nReserve, if such approval is then required by \nthe Federal Reserve or, in the case of the    \nExchangeable Preferred Stock, the approval of \nthe OCC.                                      \n                                              \nThe Company will provide a copy of any        \nReplacement Capital Covenant to a holder of   \nthe relevant Covered Debt.
