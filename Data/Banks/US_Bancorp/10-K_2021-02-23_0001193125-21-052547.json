Continued deterioration in general \nbusiness and economic conditions or turbulence\nin domestic or global financial markets could \nadversely affect U.S. Bancorp\u2019s revenues and  \nthe values of its assets and liabilities,     \nreduce the availability of funding to certain \nfinancial institutions, lead to a tightening  \nof credit, and increase stock price           \nvolatility. In addition, changes to statutes, \nregulations, or regulatory policies or        \npractices could affect U.S. Bancorp in        \nsubstantial and unpredictable ways. U.S.      \nBancorp\u2019s results could also be adversely     \naffected by changes in interest rates; further\nincreases in unemployment rates; deterioration\nin the credit quality of its loan portfolios  \nor in the value of the collateral securing    \nthose loans; deterioration in the value of its\ninvestment securities; legal and regulatory   \ndevelopments; litigation; increased           \ncompetition from both banks and non-          \nbanks;civil unrest; changes in customer       \nbehavior and preferences; breaches in data    \nsecurity; failures to safeguard personal      \ninformation; effects of mergers and           \nacquisitions and related integration; effects \nof critical accounting policies and judgments;\nand management\u2019s ability to effectively manage\ncredit risk, market risk, operational risk,   \ncompliance risk, strategic risk, interest rate\nrisk, liquidity risk and reputation risk.

Competition The financial services \nindustry is highly competitive. The Company   \ncompetes with other commercial banks, savings \nand loan associations, mutual savings banks,  \nfinance companies, mortgage banking companies,\ncredit unions, investment companies, credit   \ncard companies and a variety of other         \nfinancial services, advisory and technology   \ncompanies. The financial services industry    \ncontinues to undergo rapid technological      \nchange with frequent introductions of new     \ntechnology-driven products and services,      \nincluding innovative ways that customers can  \nmake payments or manage their accounts, such  \nas through the use of mobile payments, digital\nwallets or digital currencies. In recent      \nyears, competition has increased from         \ninstitutions not subject to the same          \nregulatory restrictions as domestic banks and \nbank holding companies, including by financial\ntechnology companies, or \u201cfintechs,\u201d which may\noffer bank-like products or services that     \ncompete directly with the Company\u2019s products  \nand services. Competition is based on a number\nof factors, including, among others, customer \nservice, quality and range of products and    \nservices offered, price, reputation, interest \nrates on loans and deposits, lending limits   \nand customer convenience, including the       \nability to address customer needs by using    \ntechnology to provide products and services   \nthat customers want to adopt. The Company\u2019s   \nability to continue to compete effectively    \nalso depends in large part on its ability to  \nattract new employees and retain and motivate \nexisting employees, while managing            \ncompensation and other costs. For additional  \ninformation relating to how the Company       \nattracts and retains employees, see \u201cHuman    \nCapital\u201d above. Information Security          \nInformation security, including cybersecurity,\nis a high priority for the Company. Recent    \nhighly publicized events have highlighted the \nimportance of cybersecurity, including        \ncyberattacks against financial institutions,  \ngovernmental agencies and other organizations \nthat resulted in the compromise of personal   \nand/or confidential information, the theft or \ndestruction of corporate information, and     \ndemands for ransom payments to release        \ncorporate information encrypted by so-        \ncalled\u201cransomware.\u201d A successful cyberattack, \nincluding an attack at a third-party vendor   \nthe Company utilizes, could harm the Company\u2019s\nreputation and/or impair its ability to       \nprovide services to its customers. The Company\nhas expended, and may in the future expend,   \nsignificant resources to implement            \ntechnologies and various response and recovery\nplans and procedures as part of its           \ninformation security program. For additional  \ninformation on cybersecurity risks the Company\nfaces, refer to Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d below.\nGovernment Policies The operations of the     \nCompany\u2019s various businesses are affected by  \nfederal and state laws and legislative changes\nand by policies of various regulatory         \nauthorities of the numerous states in which   \nthey operate, the United States and foreign   \ngovernments. These laws, rules and policies   \ninclude, for example, statutory maximum legal \nlending rates, domestic monetary policies of  \nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem (the \u201cFederal Reserve\u201d), United States \nfiscal policy, international currency         \nregulations and monetary policies and capital \nadequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by \nbank regulatory agencies. 5                   \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Supervision and Regulation                  \n                                              \nU.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject \nto the extensive regulatory framework         \napplicable to bank holding companies and their\nsubsidiaries. This regulatory framework is    \nintended primarily for the protection of      \ndepositors, the deposit insurance fund (the   \n\u201cDIF\u201d) of the Federal Deposit Insurance       \nCorporation (the \u201cFDIC\u201d), consumers, the      \nstability of the financial system in the      \nUnited States, and the health of the national \neconomy, and not for investors in bank holding\ncompanies such as the Company.                \n                                              \nThis section summarizes certain provisions of \nthe principal laws and regulations applicable \nto the Company and its subsidiaries. The      \ndescriptions are not intended to be complete  \nand are qualified in their entirety by        \nreference to the full text of the statutes and\nregulations described below.                  \n                                              \nGeneral As a bank holding company, the Company\nis subject to regulation under the BHC Act and\nto inspection, examination and supervision by \nthe Federal Reserve. U.S.\u00a0Bank National       \nAssociation and its subsidiaries are subject  \nto regulation, examination and supervision    \nprimarily by the Office of the Comptroller of \nthe Currency (the \u201cOCC\u201d) and also by the FDIC,\nthe Federal Reserve, the Consumer Financial   \nProtection Bureau (the \u201cCFPB\u201d), the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and the   \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission (the   \n\u201cCFTC\u201d) in certain areas.                     \n                                              \nSupervision and regulation by the responsible \nregulatory agency generally include           \ncomprehensive annual reviews of all major     \naspects of a bank holding company\u2019s or bank\u2019s \nbusiness and condition, and imposition of     \nperiodic reporting requirements and           \nlimitations on investments and certain types  \nof activities. U.S. Bank National Association,\nthe Company and the Company\u2019s non-bank        \naffiliates must undergo regular on-site       \nexaminations by the appropriate regulatory    \nagency, which examine for adherence to a range\nof legal and regulatory compliance            \nrequirements. If they deem the Company to be  \noperating in a manner that is inconsistent    \nwith safe and sound banking practices, the    \napplicable regulatory agencies can require the\nentry into informal or formal supervisory     \nagreements, including board resolutions,      \nmemoranda of understanding, written agreements\nand consent or cease and desist orders,       \npursuant to which the Company would be        \nrequired to take identified corrective actions\nto address cited concerns and to refrain from \ntaking certain actions. Supervision and       \nexaminations are confidential, and the        \noutcomes of these actions generally are not   \nmade public.                                  \n                                              \nBanking and other financial services statutes,\nregulations and policies are continually under\nreview by the United States Congress, state   \nlegislatures and federal and state regulatory \nagencies. In addition to laws and regulations,\nstate and federal bank regulatory agencies may\nissue policy statements, interpretive letters \nand similar written guidance applicable to the\nCompany and its subsidiaries. Any change in   \nthe statutes, regulations or regulatory       \npolicies applicable to the Company, including \nchanges in their interpretation or            \nimplementation, could have a material effect  \non its business or organization.              \n                                              \nAs a bank holding company with over $250      \nbillion in total consolidated assets, the     \nCompany is subject to the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s    \nenhanced prudential standards requirements.   \nThe Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by the Economic\nGrowth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer        \nProtection Act (\u201cEGRRCPA\u201d), however, mandated \nthat the Federal Reserve tailor the enhanced  \nprudential standards applicable to a bank     \nholding company or category of bank holding   \ncompanies based on several factors, including \nsize, capital structure, complexity, and other\nrisk-related factors. In October 2019, the    \nfederal banking regulators adopted two final  \nrules (the \u201cTailoring Rules\u201d) that revised the\ncriteria for determining the applicability of \nregulatory capital and liquidity requirements \nfor large United States banking organizations,\nincluding the Company and U.S. Bank National  \nAssociation, and that tailored the application\nof the Federal Reserve\u2019s enhanced prudential  \nstandards to large banking organizations. The \nrules applicable to the Company and U.S. Bank \nNational Association are described in more    \ndetail below.                                 \n                                              \nSupervisory Ratings Federal banking regulators\nregularly examine the Company and U.S. Bank   \nNational Association to evaluate their        \nfinancial condition and monitor their         \ncompliance with laws and regulatory policies. \nFollowing those exams, the Company and U.S.   \nBank National Association are assigned        \nsupervisory ratings. These ratings are        \nconsidered confidential supervisory           \ninformation and disclosure to third parties is\nnot allowed                                   \n                      6                       \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nwithout permission of the issuing regulator.  \nViolations of laws and regulations or deemed  \ndeficiencies in risk management or compliance \npractices may be incorporated into these      \nsupervisory ratings. A downgrade in these     \nratings could limit the Company\u2019s ability to  \npursue acquisitions or conduct other          \nexpansionary activities for a period of time, \nrequire new or additional regulatory approvals\nbefore engaging in certain other business     \nactivities or investments, affect U.S. Bank   \nNational Association\u2019s deposit insurance      \nassessment rate, and impose additional        \nrecordkeeping and corporate governance        \nrequirements, as well as generally increase   \nregulatory scrutiny of the Company.           \n                                              \nIn November 2018, the Federal Reserve adopted \nthe Large Financial Institution Rating System \n(\u201cLFI Rating System\u201d), which replaced the     \nprior rating system for large financial       \ninstitutions, including the Company, and      \naligned the supervisory rating system with the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s supervisory programs for    \nthese firms. As compared to the rating system \nit replaced, which continues to be used for   \nsmaller bank holding companies, the LFI Rating\nSystem places a greater emphasis on capital   \nand liquidity, including related planning and \nrisk management practices. Ratings issued     \nunder the LFI Rating System will remain       \nconfidential.                                 \n                                              \nThe Federal Reserve has also proposed guidance\nfor the governance and controls component of  \nthe LFI Rating System that addresses the role \nof boards of directors as well as the         \nresponsibilities of members of senior and     \nbusiness line management and controls at large\nfinancial institutions.                       \n                                              \nBank Holding Company Activities The Company is\na bank holding company under the BHC Act and  \nhas elected to be a financial holding company \npursuant to the provisions of the Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act (the \u201cGLBA\u201d). Under the GLBA, bank \nholding companies that qualify and elect to be\ntreated as financial holding companies may    \nengage in, and affiliate with financial       \ncompanies engaging in, a broader range of     \nactivities than would otherwise be permitted  \nfor a bank holding company. Under the GLBA\u2019s  \nsystem of \u201cfunctional regulation,\u201d the Federal\nReserve acts as an umbrella regulator for the \nCompany, and certain of the Company\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries are primarily regulated directly \nby additional agencies based on the particular\nactivities of those subsidiaries.             \n                                              \nIf a financial holding company or a depository\ninstitution controlled by a financial holding \ncompany ceases to be well-capitalized or well-\nmanaged, the Federal Reserve may impose       \ncorrective capital and managerial requirements\non the financial holding company and may place\nlimitations on its ability to conduct all of  \nthe business activities that financial holding\ncompanies are generally permitted to conduct  \nand its ability to make certain acquisitions. \nSee \u201cPermissible Business Activities\u201d below.  \nIf the failure to meet these standards        \npersists, the financial holding company may be\nrequired to divest its depository institution \nsubsidiaries or cease all activities other    \nthan those activities that may be conducted by\nbank holding companies that are not financial \nholding companies. In addition, if a          \ndepository institution controlled by a        \nfinancial holding company does not receive a  \nCommunity Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) rating of  \nat least \u201csatisfactory\u201d at its most recent    \nexamination, the Federal Reserve will prohibit\nthe financial holding company from conducting \nnew business activities that financial holding\ncompanies are generally permitted to conduct  \nand from making certain acquisitions.         \n                                              \nThe Federal Reserve also requires bank holding\ncompanies to meet certain applicable capital  \nand management standards. Failure by the      \nCompany to meet these standards could limit   \nthe Company from engaging in any new activity \nor acquiring other companies without the prior\napproval of the Federal Reserve.              \n                                              \nPermissible Business Activities As a financial\nholding company, the Company may affiliate    \nwith securities firms and insurance companies \nand engage in other activities that are       \nfinancial in nature or incidental or          \ncomplementary to activities that are financial\nin nature. \u201cFinancial in nature\u201d activities   \ninclude securities underwriting, dealing and  \nmarket making; sponsoring mutual funds and    \ninvestment companies; insurance underwriting  \nand agency; merchant banking; and activities  \nthat the Federal Reserve, in consultation with\nthe Secretary of the United States Treasury,  \ndetermines to be financial in nature or       \nincidental to such financial activity.        \n\u201cComplementary activities\u201d are activities that\nthe Federal Reserve determines upon           \napplication to be complementary to a financial\nactivity and that do not pose a safety and    \nsoundness risk.                               \n                      7                       \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe Company generally is not required to      \nobtain Federal Reserve approval to acquire a  \ncompany (other than a bank holding company,   \nbank or savings association) engaged in       \nactivities that are financial in nature or    \nincidental to activities that are financial in\nnature, as determined by the Federal Reserve, \nas long as the Company meets the capital,     \nmanagerial and CRA requirements to qualify as \na financial holding company. However, the     \nCompany is required to receive approval for an\nacquisition in which the total consolidated   \nassets to be acquired exceed $10 billion.     \nFinancial holding companies are also required \nto obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve \nbefore they may acquire more than five percent\nof the voting shares or substantially all of  \nthe assets of an unaffiliated bank holding    \ncompany, bank or savings association. In      \naddition, banks must receive approval before  \nthey may acquire, merge with, acquire         \nsubstantially all of the assets of or assume  \nany deposits of a bank or savings association \nand may be required to receive approval for   \nacquisitions of other companies.              \n                                              \nInterstate Banking A bank holding company may \nacquire banks in states other than its home   \nstate, subject to any state requirement that  \nthe bank has been organized and operating for \na minimum period of time (not to exceed five  \nyears). Also, such an acquisition is not      \npermitted if the bank holding company         \ncontrols, prior to or following the proposed  \nacquisition, more than 10\u00a0percent of the total\namount of deposits of insured depository      \ninstitutions nationwide, or, if the           \nacquisition is the bank holding company\u2019s     \ninitial entry into the state, more than       \n30\u00a0percent of the deposits of insured         \ndepository institutions in the state (or any  \nlesser or greater amount set by the state).   \n                                              \nBanks may merge across state lines to create  \ninterstate branches and are permitted to      \nestablish new branches in another state to the\nsame extent as banks chartered by that state. \n                                              \nRegulatory Approval for Acquisitions In       \ndetermining whether to approve a proposed bank\nacquisition, federal bank regulators will     \nconsider a number of factors, including the   \neffect of the acquisition on competition,     \nfinancial condition and future prospects      \n(including current and projected capital      \nratios and levels); the competence, experience\nand integrity of management and its record of \ncompliance with laws and regulations; the     \nconvenience and needs of the communities to be\nserved (including the acquiring institution\u2019s \nrecord of compliance under the CRA); the      \neffectiveness of the acquiring institution in \ncombating money laundering activities; and the\nextent to which the transaction would result  \nin greater or more concentrated risks to the  \nstability of the United States banking or     \nfinancial system. In addition, approval of    \ninterstate transactions requires that the     \nacquiror satisfy regulatory standards for     \nwell-capitalized and well-managed             \ninstitutions.                                 \n                                              \nSource of Strength The Company is required to \nact as a source of strength to U.S. Bank      \nNational Association, and to commit capital   \nand financial resources to support this       \nsubsidiary in circumstances where it might not\notherwise do so. Under these requirements, the\nFederal Reserve may in the future require the \nCompany to provide financial assistance to    \nU.S. Bank National Association, should it     \nexperience financial distress. Capital loans  \nby the Company to U.S. Bank National          \nAssociation would be subordinate in right of  \npayment to deposits and certain other debts of\nU.S. Bank National Association. In the event  \nof the Company\u2019s bankruptcy, any commitment by\nthe Company to a federal bank regulatory      \nagency to maintain the capital of U.S. Bank   \nNational Association would be assumed by the  \nbankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority \nof payment.                                   \n                                              \nOCC Heightened Standards The OCC has issued   \nguidelines establishing heightened standards  \nfor large national banks such as U.S. Bank    \nNational Association. The guidelines establish\nminimum standards for the design and          \nimplementation of a risk governance framework \nfor banks. The OCC may take action against    \ninstitutions that fail to meet these          \nstandards.                                    \n                                              \nEnhanced Prudential Standards Under the Dodd- \nFrank Act, as modified by the EGRRCPA and the \nTailoring Rules, large bank holding companies,\nsuch as the Company, are subject to certain   \nenhanced prudential standards based on the    \nbanking organization\u2019s size, status as a      \nglobal systemically important bank, cross-    \njurisdictional activity, weighted short-term  \nwholesale funding, nonbank assets and off-    \nbalance sheet exposures. The prudential       \nstandards include enhanced risk-based capital \nand leverage requirements, enhanced liquidity \nrequirements, enhanced risk management and    \nrisk committee requirements, a requirement to \nsubmit a resolution                           \n                      8                       \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nplan, single-counterparty credit limits and   \nstress tests. These standards also require the\nFederal Reserve to impose a maximum 15-to-1   \ndebt-to-equity ratio on a bank holding company\nwith total consolidated assets of $250\u00a0billion\nor more, if the Financial Stability Oversight \nCouncil determines that the company poses a   \ngrave threat to the financial stability of the\nUnited States and that the imposition of such \na debt-to-equity requirement would mitigate   \nsuch risk. In addition, the Federal Reserve is\nrequired to establish early remediation       \nrequirements for bank holding companies with  \ntotal consolidated assets of $250\u00a0billion or  \nmore, but these requirements have not yet been\nfinalized.                                    \n                                              \nCertain of the enhanced prudential standards  \napplicable to the Company are described below \nin further detail, including changes that have\nbeen made to these requirements under the     \nTailoring Rules.                              \n                                              \nDividend Restrictions The Company is a legal  \nentity separate and distinct from its         \nsubsidiaries. Typically, the majority of the  \nCompany\u2019s operating funds are received in the \nform of dividends paid to the Company by U.S. \nBank National Association. Federal law imposes\nlimitations on the payment of dividends by    \nnational banks.                               \n                                              \nIn general, dividends payable by U.S. Bank    \nNational Association and the Company\u2019s trust  \nbank subsidiaries, as national banking        \nassociations, are limited by rules that       \ncompare dividends to net income for periods   \ndefined by regulation.                        \n                                              \nThe OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC also\nhave authority to prohibit or limit the       \npayment of dividends by the banking           \norganizations they supervise (including the   \nCompany and U.S. Bank National Association),  \nif, in the banking regulator\u2019s opinion,       \npayment of a dividend would constitute an     \nunsafe or unsound practice in light of the    \nfinancial condition of the banking            \norganization.                                 \n                                              \nIn March 2020, the Federal Reserve approved a \nfinal rule replacing the static 2.5 percent   \ncomponent of the capital conservation buffer  \nwith the stress capital buffer (\u201cSCB\u201d) for    \nbank holding companies with $100 billion or   \nmore in total consolidated assets, such as the\nCompany. The SCB reflects stressed losses in  \nthe supervisory severely adverse scenario of  \nthe CCAR stress tests, described in more      \ndetail in \u201cStress Testing\u201d below, and includes\nfour quarters of planned common stock         \ndividends. The SCB is subject to a 2.5 percent\nfloor. A firm\u2019s SCB requirement is generally  \neffective on October 1 of each year and       \nremains in effect until October 1 of the      \nfollowing year, unless the firm\u2019s SCB is reset\nin connection with a resubmission of a capital\nplan. The Company\u2019s first SCB requirement of  \n2.5 percent took effect on October 1, 2020.   \n                                              \nThe final rule implementing the SCB also      \nprovides that a bank holding company must     \nreceive prior approval for any dividend, stock\nrepurchase or other capital distribution,     \nother than a capital distribution on a newly  \nissued capital instrument, if the bank holding\ncompany is required to resubmit its capital   \nplan. In connection with the November 2020    \nresubmission described under \u201cComprehensive   \nCapital Analysis and Review\u201d below, the       \nFederal Reserve required those bank holding   \ncompanies, including the Company, to suspend  \nstock repurchases during the third and fourth \nquarters of 2020, and not to increase common  \nstock dividends or pay common stock dividends \nin excess of their average net income over the\npast four quarters. In December 2020, the     \nFederal Reserve announced that these bank     \nholding companies could continue existing     \ndividend payments and resume stock repurchases\nin the first quarter of 2021, as long as the  \ncombined amounts of repurchases and dividends \nin that quarter do not exceed the bank holding\ncompany\u2019s average earnings per quarter over   \nthe last four quarters.                       \n                                              \nCapital Requirements The Company is subject to\ncertain regulatory risk-based capital and     \nleverage requirements under capital rules     \nadopted by the Federal Reserve, and U.S. Bank \nNational Association is subject to            \nsubstantially similar rules adopted by the    \nOCC. These rules implement the Basel          \nCommittee\u2019s framework for strengthening the   \nregulation, supervision and risk management of\nbanks (\u201cBasel III\u201d), as well as certain       \nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. These       \nquantitative calculations are minimums, and   \nthe Federal Reserve and OCC may determine that\na banking organization, based on its size,    \ncomplexity or risk profile, must maintain a   \nhigher level of capital in order to operate in\na safe and sound manner.                      \n                      9                       \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nUnder the Tailoring Rules, the Company and    \nU.S. Bank National Association are each       \nsubject to \u201cCategory III\u201d standards because   \nthey are not subject to \u201cCategory I\u201d or       \n\u201cCategory II\u201d standards and have at least     \n$250\u00a0billion in total consolidated assets.    \nAccordingly, the Company and U.S. Bank        \nNational Association are \u201cstandardized        \napproach\u201d banking organizations. As           \n\u201cstandardized approach\u201d banking organizations,\nthe Company and U.S. Bank National Association\nare subject to the final rule adopted by the  \nbanking regulators in July 2019 relating to   \nsimplifications of the capital rules          \napplicable to non-advanced approach           \norganizations. These rules became effective on\nJanuary\u00a01, 2020, and provide for simplified   \ncapital requirements relating to the threshold\ndeductions for mortgage servicing assets,     \ndeferred tax assets arising from temporary    \ndifferences that a banking organization could \nnot realize through net operating loss carry  \nbacks, and investments in the capital of      \nunconsolidated financial institutions, as well\nas the inclusion of minority interests in     \nregulatory capital.                           \n                                              \nUnder the United States Basel III-based       \ncapital rules, the Company is subject to a    \nminimum common equity tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) capital \nratio (CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets)  \nof 4.5\u00a0percent, a minimum tier 1 capital ratio\nof 6.0\u00a0percent and a minimum total capital    \nratio of 8.0\u00a0percent. The Company is also     \nsubject to the SCB, which is based on the     \nresults of the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory  \nstress tests and the Company\u2019s planned common \nstock dividends, and, if deployed by the      \nFederal Reserve, up to a 2.5\u00a0percent common   \nequity tier 1 countercyclical capital buffer. \nThese additional requirements must be         \nsatisfied entirely with capital that qualifies\nas CET1. The countercyclical capital buffer   \napplies only to banking organizations subject \nto Category I, II or III standards under the  \nTailoring Rules, including the Company.       \nAlthough the Federal Reserve has not to date  \nraised the countercyclical capital buffer     \nabove zero percent, the countercyclical       \ncapital buffer could change in the future. The\nSCB replaces the static 2.5\u00a0percent component \nof the capital conservation buffer and is     \nlikely to vary over time. As of December\u00a031,  \n2020, the SCB applicable to the Company is    \n2.5\u00a0percent. If the Federal Reserve were to   \nraise the countercyclical capital buffer above\nzero percent, or if the SCB applicable to the \nCompany were to exceed 2.5\u00a0percent, this would\nalso change the effective minimum capital     \nratios to which the Company is subject.       \n                                              \nBanking organizations that fail to meet the   \neffective minimum ratios will be subject to   \nconstraints on capital distributions,         \nincluding dividends and share repurchases and \ncertain discretionary executive compensation, \nwith the severity of the constraints depending\non the extent of the shortfall and \u201celigible  \nretained income\u201d (since March 2020, defined as\nthe greater of (i) net income for the four    \npreceding quarters, net of distributions and  \nassociated tax effects not reflected in net   \nincome; and (ii) the average of all net income\nover the preceding four quarters), with       \nprogressively more stringent constraints on   \ncapital actions as the Company approaches the \nminimum ratios.                               \n                                              \nUnited States banking organizations are also  \nsubject to a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of \n4.0\u00a0percent. Banking organizations subject to \nCategory I, II or III standards under the     \nTailoring Rules, including the Company, are   \nalso subject to a minimum Supplementary       \nLeverage Ratio (\u201cSLR\u201d) of 3.0\u00a0percent that    \ntakes into account both on-balance sheet and  \ncertain off-balance sheet exposures. At       \nDecember\u00a031, 2020, the Company exceeded the   \napplicable minimum tier 1 leverage ratio and  \nSLR requirements.                             \n                                              \nIn December 2017, the Basel Committee         \nfinalized a package of revisions to the Basel \nIII framework. The changes are meant to       \nimprove the calculation of risk-weighted      \nassets (including by recalibrating risk       \nweights and introducing new capital           \nrequirements for certain \u201cunconditionally     \ncancellable commitments,\u201d including unused    \nlines of credit) and improve the comparability\nof capital ratios by (i)\u00a0enhancing the        \nrobustness and risk sensitivity of the        \nstandardized approaches for credit risk,      \ncredit valuation adjustment (\u201cCVA\u201d) risk and  \noperational risk; (ii)\u00a0constraining the use of\nthe internal model approaches, by placing     \nlimits on certain inputs used to calculate    \ncapital requirements under the internal       \nratings-based (\u201cIRB\u201d) approach for credit risk\nand by removing the use of the internal model \napproaches for CVA risk and for operational   \nrisk; (iii)\u00a0introducing a leverage ratio      \nbuffer to further limit the leverage of global\nsystemically important banks (\u201cG-SIBs\u201d); and  \n(iv)\u00a0replacing the existing Basel II output   \nfloor with a more robust risk-sensitive floor \nbased on the Committee\u2019s revised Basel III    \nstandardized approaches. Under the Basel      \nstandards, the implementation date for the    \nrevised standardized approach for credit risk \nand leverage ratios as well as the IRB, CVA,  \noperational risk, and market risk frameworks  \nis January\u00a01, 2023. In addition, in January   \n2019, the Basel Committee published a revised \nmarket                                        \n                      10                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nrisk framework that, among other things,      \nrevises the standardized approach for market  \nrisk. The output floor will be subject to a   \ntransitional period beginning in January 1,   \n2023, with full implementation by January 1,  \n2028. The effects of these revisions on the   \nCompany and U.S. Bank National Association    \nwill depend on the manner in which they are   \nimplemented by the United States federal      \nbanking agencies.                             \n                                              \nDuring 2020, the United States federal banking\nagencies adopted a rule that allows banking   \norganizations, including the Company and U.S. \nBank National Association, to elect to delay  \ntemporarily the estimated effects of adopting \nthe current expected credit loss accounting   \nstandard (\u201cCECL\u201d) on regulatory capital until \nJanuary 2022 and subsequently to phase in the \neffects through January 2025. The Federal     \nReserve has also stated that it will not      \nincorporate CECL into the calculation of the  \nallowance for credit losses in supervisory    \nstress tests through the 2021 stress test     \ncycle. For further discussion of CECL, see    \nNotes 1, 2 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated \nFinancial Statements in the 2020 Annual       \nReport. The Company and U.S. Bank National    \nAssociation elected to delay and subsequently \nphase in the regulatory capital impact of CECL\nin accordance with this rule.                 \n                                              \nFor additional information regarding the      \nCompany\u2019s regulatory capital, see \u201cCapital    \nManagement\u201d in the 2020 Annual Report.        \n                                              \nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review As  \nrequired by the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR rules, \nthe Company submits a capital plan to the     \nFederal Reserve on an annual basis. As part of\nthe CCAR process, the Federal Reserve         \nevaluates the Company\u2019s plans to make capital \ndistributions, including by repurchasing stock\nor making dividend payments, under a number of\nmacroeconomic and Company-specific assumptions\nbased on the Company\u2019s and the Federal        \nReserve\u2019s stress tests described under \u201cStress\nTesting\u201d below. These capital plans consist of\na number of mandatory elements, including an  \nassessment of a company\u2019s sources and uses of \ncapital over a nine-quarter planning horizon  \nassuming both expected and stressful          \nconditions; a detailed description of a       \ncompany\u2019s process for assessing capital       \nadequacy; and a demonstration of a company\u2019s  \nability to maintain capital above each minimum\nregulatory capital ratio (without taking the  \nbuffers into account) under expected and      \nstressful conditions.                         \n                                              \nIn June 2020, all bank holding companies      \nparticipating in CCAR 2020, including the     \nCompany, were required by the Federal Reserve \nto resubmit their capital plans in November   \n2020 in light of the ongoing economic effects \nof the COVID-19 pandemic. After reviewing the \nresubmitted capital plans, in December 2020,  \nthe Federal Reserve announced that these bank \nholding companies, including the Company,     \ncould continue existing dividend payments and \nresume stock repurchases in the first quarter \nof 2021, as long as the combined amounts of   \nrepurchases and dividends in that quarter do  \nnot exceed the bank holding company\u2019s average \nearnings per quarter over the last four       \nquarters.                                     \n                                              \nStress Testing The Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR     \nframework and the Dodd-Frank Act stress       \ntesting framework require bank holding        \ncompanies subject to Category III standards   \nsuch as the Company to conduct an annual      \ninternal stress test in connection with its   \nannual capital plan submission as well as     \nbiennial company-run stress tests, and subject\nsuch bank holding companies to annual         \nsupervisory stress tests conducted by the     \nFederal Reserve. Among other things, the      \ncompany-run stress tests employ stress        \nscenarios developed by the Company as well as \nstress scenarios provided by the Federal      \nReserve and incorporate the Dodd-Frank Act    \ncapital actions (as opposed to the Company\u2019s  \nplanned capital actions), which are intended  \nto normalize capital distributions across     \nlarge United States bank holding companies.   \nThe Federal Reserve conducts CCAR and Dodd-   \nFrank Act supervisory stress tests employing  \nstress scenarios and internal supervisory     \nmodels. The Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR and Dodd-  \nFrank Act supervisory stress tests incorporate\nthe Company\u2019s planned capital actions and the \nDodd-Frank Act capital actions, respectively. \nThe Federal Reserve and the Company are       \ncurrently required to publish the results of  \nthe annual supervisory and biennial company-  \nrun stress tests, respectively, no later than \nJune\u00a030 of each applicable year. Under the    \nTailoring Rules, the Company is no longer     \nrequired to conduct mid-cycle stress tests,   \nand the Federal Reserve has eliminated the    \nadverse scenario as a mandatory scenario.     \n                                              \nIn October 2019, the OCC adopted a final rule \nthat aligned the stress testing requirements  \nfor national banks with requirements for their\nholding companies under the Tailoring Rules.  \nUnder the OCC\u2019s rule, national banks          \n                      11                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nwith assets in excess of $250\u00a0billion,        \nincluding U.S. Bank National Association, are \nrequired to submit company-run stress test    \nresults to the OCC concurrently with their    \nparent bank holding company\u2019s CCAR submission \nto the Federal Reserve. Accordingly, U.S. Bank\nNational Association began submitting company-\nrun stress tests on a biennial basis starting \nwith its 2020 submission. The stress test is  \nbased on the OCC\u2019s stress scenarios (which are\ntypically the same as the Federal Reserve\u2019s   \nstress scenarios, and which will no longer    \ninclude \u201cadverse\u201d stress scenarios) and       \ncapital actions that are appropriate for the  \neconomic conditions assumed in each scenario. \n                                              \nBasel III Liquidity Requirements Bank holding \ncompanies and their domestic bank subsidiaries\nsubject to Category I, II or III standards    \nunder the Tailoring Rules are subject to a    \nminimum Liquidity Coverage Ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d). The \nLCR is designed to ensure that bank holding   \ncompanies have sufficient high-quality liquid \nassets to survive a significant liquidity     \nstress event lasting for 30 calendar days.    \n                                              \nIn October 2020, the federal banking          \nregulators finalized a rule to implement the  \nNet Stable Funding Ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d). The NSFR is\ndesigned to promote stable, longer-term       \nfunding of assets and business activities over\na one-year time horizon and applies to the    \nCompany and U.S. Bank National Association.   \nThe final rule is generally similar to the May\n2016 proposal with modifications to           \nincorporate the changes made in the Tailoring \nRules and align funding requirements for      \ncertain non-derivative assets and short-term  \nlending transactions to better reflect their  \nrisks and role in supporting the stability of \ncertain funding markets.                      \n                                              \nUnder the Tailoring Rules and final NSFR rule,\nthe Company and U.S. Bank National            \nAssociation, as Category III banking          \norganizations with less than $75 billion of   \nweighted short-term wholesale funding, qualify\nfor reduced LCR and NSFR requirements         \ncalibrated at 85 percent of the full          \nrequirements.                                 \n                                              \nBrokered Deposits The Federal Deposit         \nInsurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 \n(the \u201cFDICIA\u201d) and FDIC regulations limit the \nability of an insured depository institution, \nsuch as U.S. Bank National Association, to    \naccept, renew or roll over brokered deposits  \nunless the institution is well-capitalized    \nunder the prompt corrective action framework  \ndescribed below, or unless it is adequately   \ncapitalized and obtains a waiver from the     \nFDIC. In addition, less than well-capitalized \nbanks are subject to restrictions on the      \ninterest rates they may pay on deposits. In   \nDecember 2020, the FDIC issued a final rule   \nthat is designed to encourage innovation in   \nhow banks offer services and products to      \ncustomers by reducing obstacles to certain    \ntypes of partnerships and that is expected to \nreduce the amount of deposits that would be   \nclassified as brokered. Full compliance with  \nthe final rule is required as of January\u00a01,   \n2022. U.S. Bank National Association is       \nreviewing its deposits in light of the final  \nrule. The ultimate impact of the final rule on\nU.S. Bank National Association may be limited \nbecause the liquidity rules\u2019 treatment of     \ncertain deposits remains unchanged even if    \nsuch deposits would no longer be deemed to be \nbrokered deposits under the FDIC\u2019s final rule.\n                                              \nPrompt Corrective Action The FDICIA provides a\nframework for regulation of depository        \ninstitutions and their affiliates (including  \nparent holding companies) by federal banking  \nregulators. As part of that framework, the    \nFDICIA requires the relevant federal banking  \nregulator to take \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d  \nwith respect to an FDIC-insured depository    \ninstitution, such as U.S. Bank National       \nAssociation, if that institution does not meet\ncertain capital adequacy standards.           \nSupervisory actions by the appropriate federal\nbanking regulator under the \u201cprompt corrective\naction\u201d rules generally depend upon an        \ninstitution\u2019s classification within five      \ncapital categories. An institution that fails \nto remain well-capitalized becomes subject to \na series of restrictions that increase in     \nseverity as its capital condition weakens.    \nSuch restrictions may include a prohibition on\ncapital distributions, restrictions on asset  \ngrowth or restrictions on the ability to      \nreceive regulatory approval of applications.  \nThe FDICIA also provides for enhanced         \nsupervisory authority over undercapitalized   \ninstitutions, including authority for the     \nappointment of a conservator or receiver for  \nthe institution.                              \n                                              \nThe regulations apply only to banks and not to\nbank holding companies such as the Company.   \nHowever, the Federal Reserve is authorized to \ntake appropriate action at the holding company\nlevel, based on the undercapitalized status of\nthe holding company\u2019s subsidiary banking      \ninstitutions. In certain instances, relating  \nto                                            \n                      12                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nan undercapitalized banking institution, the  \nbank holding company would be required to     \nguarantee the performance of the              \nundercapitalized subsidiary\u2019s capital         \nrestoration plan and could be liable for civil\nmoney damages for failure to fulfill those    \nguarantee commitments.                        \n                                              \nSingle-Counterparty Credit Limits In June     \n2018, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule \nregarding single-counterparty credit limits   \n(\u201cSCCL\u201d) for large banking organizations,     \nincluding the Company. Under these rules, the \nCompany is subject to a limit of 25\u00a0percent of\nTier 1 capital for aggregate net credit       \nexposures to any other unaffiliated           \ncounterparty.                                 \n                                              \nDeposit Insurance The DIF provides insurance  \ncoverage for certain deposits, up to a        \nstandard maximum deposit insurance amount of  \n$250,000 per depositor. Deposits at U.S.      \nNational Bank are insured up to the applicable\nlimits. The DIF is funded through assessments \non insured depository institutions, including \nU.S. Bank National Association, based on the  \nrisk each institution poses to the DIF. The   \nFDIC may increase U.S. Bank National          \nAssociation\u2019s insurance premiums based on     \nvarious factors, including the FDIC\u2019s         \nassessment of its risk profile.               \n                                              \nIn addition, large insured depository         \ninstitutions, including U.S. Bank National    \nAssociation, are subject to enhanced deposit  \naccount recordkeeping and related information \ntechnology system requirements meant to       \nfacilitate prompt payment of insured deposits \nif such an institution were to fail.          \n                                              \nPowers of the FDIC Upon Insolvency of an      \nInsured Institution If the FDIC is appointed  \nthe conservator or receiver of an insured     \ndepository institution upon its insolvency or \nin certain other events, the FDIC has the     \npower to (i)\u00a0transfer any of the depository   \ninstitution\u2019s assets and liabilities to a new \nobligor without the approval of the depository\ninstitution\u2019s creditors; (ii)\u00a0enforce the     \nterms of the depository institution\u2019s         \ncontracts pursuant to their terms; or         \n(iii)\u00a0repudiate or disaffirm any contracts (if\nthe FDIC determines that performance of the   \ncontract is burdensome and that the           \nrepudiation or disaffirmation is necessary to \npromote the orderly administration of the     \ndepository institution). These provisions     \nwould be applicable to obligations and        \nliabilities of the Company\u2019s insured          \ndepository institution subsidiary, U.S. Bank  \nNational Association.                         \n                                              \nDepositor Preference Under federal law, in the\nevent of the liquidation or other resolution  \nof an insured depository institution, the     \nclaims of a receiver of the institution for   \nadministrative expense and the claims of      \nholders of domestic deposit liabilities       \n(including the FDIC, as subrogee of the       \ndepositors) have priority over the claims of  \nother unsecured creditors of the institution, \nincluding holders of publicly issued senior or\nsubordinated debt and depositors in non-      \ndomestic offices. As a result, those          \ndebtholders and depositors would be treated   \ndifferently from, and could receive, if       \nanything, substantially less than, the        \ndepositors in domestic offices of the         \ndepository institution.                       \n                                              \nOrderly Liquidation Authority Upon the        \ninsolvency of a bank holding company, such as \nthe Company, the FDIC may be appointed as     \nconservator or receiver of the bank holding   \ncompany if the Secretary of the Treasury      \ndetermines (upon the written recommendation of\nthe FDIC and the Federal Reserve and after    \nconsultation with the President of the United \nStates) that certain conditions set forth in  \nthe Dodd-Frank Act regarding the potential    \nimpact on financial stability of the financial\ncompany\u2019s failure have been met. FDIC rules   \nset forth a comprehensive method for the      \nreceivership of a covered financial company.  \nActing as a conservator or receiver, the FDIC \nwould have broad powers to transfer any assets\nor liabilities of a bank holding company      \nwithout the approval of its creditors.        \n                                              \nResolution Plans The Company is required by   \nthe Federal Reserve and the FDIC to submit a  \nperiodic plan for the rapid and orderly       \nresolution of the Company and its significant \nlegal entities in the event of future material\nfinancial distress or failure. If the Federal \nReserve and the FDIC jointly determine that   \nthe resolution plan is not credible and such  \ndeficiencies are not cured in a timely manner,\nthe regulators may jointly impose on the      \nCompany more stringent capital, leverage or   \nliquidity requirements or restrictions on the \nCompany\u2019s growth, activities or operations. If\nthe Company were to fail to address the       \ndeficiencies in its resolution plan when      \n                      13                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nrequired, it could eventually be required to  \ndivest certain assets or operations. In       \nOctober 2019, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC\nadopted a final rule requiring banking        \norganizations that are subject to Category III\nstandards under the Tailoring Rules, including\nthe Company, to submit resolution plans on a  \ntriennial cycle (alternating between targeted \nand full submissions). On December\u00a09, 2020,   \nthe Federal Reserve and the FDIC released     \ntargeted plan guidance and directed large     \nforeign and domestic banks to file resolution \nplans including core elements of a firm\u2019s     \nresolution strategy \u2014 such as capital,        \nliquidity, and recapitalization strategies \u2014  \nas well as how each firm has integrated       \nchanges to and lessons learned from its       \nresponse to COVID-19 into its resolution      \nplanning process The Company must submit its  \ntargeted resolution plan by December\u00a017, 2021.\n                                              \nIn addition, U.S. Bank National Association is\nrequired to file periodically a separate      \nresolution plan with the FDIC that should     \nenable the FDIC, as receiver, to resolve the  \ninstitution under applicable receivership     \nprovisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance   \nAct in a manner that ensures that depositors  \nreceive access to their insured deposits      \nwithin one business day of the institution\u2019s  \nfailure, maximizes the net present value      \nreturn from the sale or disposition of its    \nassets and minimizes the amount of any loss to\nbe realized by the institution\u2019s creditors. In\nApril 2019, the FDIC released an advance      \nnotice of proposed rulemaking regarding       \npotential changes to its resolution planning  \nrequirements for insured depository           \ninstitutions, including U.S. Bank National    \nAssociation, and voted to delay the next round\nof resolution plan submissions until the      \nrulemaking process is complete. In January    \n2021, the FDIC announced that, given the      \npassage of time from the last resolution plan \nsubmissions and the uncertain economic        \noutlook, the FDIC will resume requiring       \nresolution plan submissions for insured       \ndepository institutions with $100 billion or  \nmore in assets, including U.S. Bank National  \nAssociation. The FDIC indicated that no       \ninsured depository institution will be        \nrequired to submit a resolution plan without  \nat least 12 months advance notice, but did not\notherwise provide notice of when U.S. Bank    \nNational Association will be required to      \nsubmit its next resolution plan.              \n                                              \nThe public versions of the resolution plans   \npreviously submitted by the Company and U.S.  \nBank National Association are available on the\nFDIC\u2019s website and, in the case of the        \nCompany\u2019s resolution plans, also on the       \nFederal Reserve\u2019s website.                    \n                                              \nRecovery Plans The OCC has established        \nenforceable guidelines for recovery planning  \nby insured national banks with average total  \nconsolidated assets of $250\u00a0billion or more,  \nincluding U.S. Bank National Association. The \nguidelines provide that a covered bank should \ndevelop and maintain a recovery plan that is  \nappropriate for its individual risk profile,  \nsize, activities, and complexity, including   \nthe complexity of its organizational and legal\nentity structure. The guidelines state that a \nrecovery plan should, among other elements,   \n(i)\u00a0establish triggers, which are quantitative\nor qualitative indicators of the risk or      \nexistence of severe stress that should always \nbe escalated to management or the board of    \ndirectors, as appropriate, for purposes of    \ninitiating a response; (ii)\u00a0identify a wide   \nrange of credible options that a covered bank \ncould undertake to restore financial and      \noperational strength and viability; and       \n(iii)\u00a0address escalation procedures,          \nmanagement reports, and communication         \nprocedures. The board of U.S. Bank National   \nAssociation reviewed and approved U.S. Bank   \nNational Association\u2019s recovery plan pursuant \nto these guidelines in December 2020.         \n                                              \nLiability of Commonly Controlled Institutions \nAn FDIC-insured depository institution can be \nheld liable for any loss incurred or expected \nto be incurred by the FDIC in connection with \nanother FDIC-insured institution under common \ncontrol with that institution being \u201cin       \ndefault\u201d or \u201cin danger of default\u201d (commonly  \nreferred to as \u201ccross-guarantee\u201d liability).  \nAn FDIC claim for cross-guarantee liability   \nagainst a depository institution is generally \nsuperior in right of payment to claims of the \nholding company and its affiliates against the\ndepository institution.                       \n                                              \nTransactions with Affiliates There are various\nlegal restrictions on the extent to which the \nCompany and its non-bank subsidiaries may     \nborrow or otherwise engage in certain types of\ntransactions with U.S. Bank National          \nAssociation or its subsidiaries. Under the    \nFederal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve\u2019s \nRegulation W, U.S. Bank National Association  \nand its subsidiaries are subject to           \nquantitative and qualitative limits on        \nextensions of credit (including credit        \nexposure arising from repurchase and reverse  \nrepurchase agreements, securities             \n                      14                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nborrowing and derivative transactions),       \npurchases of assets, and certain other        \ntransactions with the Company or its other    \nnon-bank subsidiaries and affiliates.         \nAdditionally, transactions between U.S. Bank  \nNational Association or its subsidiaries, on  \nthe one hand, and the Company or its other    \nnon-bank subsidiaries and affiliates, on the  \nother hand, are required to be on arm\u2019s length\nterms. Transactions between U.S. Bank National\nAssociations and its affiliates must be       \nconsistent with standards of safety and       \nsoundness.                                    \n                                              \nAnti-Money Laundering and Sanctions The       \nCompany is subject to several federal laws    \nthat are designed to combat money laundering  \nand terrorist financing, and to restrict      \ntransactions with persons, companies, or      \nforeign governments sanctioned by United      \nStates authorities. This category of laws     \nincludes the Bank Secrecy Act (the \u201cBSA\u201d), the\nMoney Laundering Control Act, the USA PATRIOT \nAct (collectively, \u201cAML laws\u201d), and           \nimplementing regulations for the International\nEmergency Economic Powers Act and the Trading \nwith the Enemy Act, as administered by the    \nUnited States Treasury Department\u2019s Office of \nForeign Assets Control (\u201csanctions laws\u201d).    \n                                              \nAs implemented by federal banking and         \nsecurities regulators and the Department of   \nthe Treasury, AML laws obligate depository    \ninstitutions and broker-dealers to verify     \ntheir customers\u2019 identity, verify the identity\nof beneficial owners of legal entity          \ncustomers, conduct customer due diligence,    \nreport on suspicious activity, file reports of\ntransactions in currency, and conduct enhanced\ndue diligence on certain accounts. Sanctions  \nlaws prohibit United States persons and       \ncertain foreign affiliates from engaging in   \nany transaction with a restricted person or   \nrestricted country. Depository institutions   \nand broker-dealers are required by their      \nrespective federal regulators to maintain     \npolicies and procedures in order to ensure    \ncompliance with the above obligations. Federal\nregulators regularly examine BSA/Anti-Money   \nLaundering (\u201cAML\u201d) and sanctions compliance   \nprograms to ensure their adequacy and         \neffectiveness, and the frequency and extent of\nsuch examinations and the remedial actions    \nresulting therefrom have been increasing.     \n                                              \nIn January 2021, the Anti-Money Laundering Act\nof 2020 (\u201cAMLA\u201d), which amends the BSA, was   \nenacted. The AMLA is intended to              \ncomprehensively reform and modernize U.S.     \nanti-money laundering laws. Among other       \nthings, the AMLA codifies a risk-based        \napproach to anti-money laundering compliance  \nfor financial institutions; requires the      \ndevelopment of standards by the U.S.          \nDepartment of the Treasury for evaluating     \ntechnology and internal processes for BSA     \ncompliance; and expands enforcement- and      \ninvestigation-related authority, including a  \nsignificant expansion in the available        \nsanctions for certain BSA violations. Many of \nthe statutory provisions in the AMLA will     \nrequire additional rulemakings, reports and   \nother measures, and the impact of the AMLA    \nwill depend on, among other things, rulemaking\nand implementation guidance.                  \n                                              \nCommunity Reinvestment Act U.S. Bank National \nAssociation is subject to the provisions of   \nthe CRA. Under the terms of the CRA, banks    \nhave a continuing and affirmative obligation, \nconsistent with safe and sound operation, to  \nhelp meet the credit needs of their           \ncommunities, including providing credit to    \nindividuals residing in low- and moderate-    \nincome neighborhoods. The CRA does not        \nestablish specific lending requirements or    \nprograms for financial institutions, and does \nnot limit an institution\u2019s discretion to      \ndevelop the types of products and services    \nthat it believes are best suited to its       \nparticular community in a manner consistent   \nwith the CRA.                                 \n                                              \nThe OCC regularly assesses U.S. Bank National \nAssociation on its record in meeting the      \ncredit needs of the community served by that  \ninstitution, including low- and moderate-     \nincome neighborhoods. CRA assessments also are\nconsidered by the Federal Reserve or OCC when \nreviewing applications by banking institutions\nto acquire, merge or consolidate with another \nbanking institution or its holding company, to\nestablish a new branch office that will accept\ndeposits, or to relocate an office. In the    \ncase of a bank holding company applying for   \napproval to acquire a bank or other bank      \nholding company, the Federal Reserve will     \nassess the CRA records of each subsidiary     \ndepository institution of the applicant bank  \nholding company, and those records may be the \nbasis for denying the application.            \n                                              \nU.S. Bank National Association received an    \n\u201cOutstanding\u201d CRA rating in its most recent   \nexamination, covering the period from January \n1, 2012 through December 31, 2015.            \n                      15                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nIn April 2018, the United States Department of\nTreasury issued a memorandum to the federal   \nbanking regulators with recommend changes to  \nthe CRA\u2019s implementing regulations to reduce  \ntheir complexity and associated burden on     \nbanks. In August 2018, the OCC issued an      \nadvance notice of proposed rulemaking to      \nsolicit ideas for building a new CRA          \nframework. In response to the feedback        \nreceived, in December 2019, the OCC and FDIC  \nreleased a notice of proposed rulemaking to   \nestablish a new CRA framework. In May 2020,   \nthe OCC issued its final CRA rule. The CRA    \nframework expands the types of activity that  \nqualify for CRA credit; revises how banks     \ndelineate their CRA assessment areas; and     \nestablishes new standards for evaluating banks\nwith more than $2.5\u00a0billion in assets,        \nincluding, the number of qualifying retail    \nloan originations to low- and moderate-income \nindividuals. The impact on U.S. Bank National \nAssociation from any changes to the CRA       \nregulations will depend on how the OCC\u2019s final\nrule is implemented.                          \n                                              \nRegulation of Brokerage, Investment Advisory  \nand Insurance Activities The Company conducts \nsecurities underwriting, dealing and brokerage\nactivities in the United States through U.S.  \nBancorp Investments, Inc. (\u201cUSBII\u201d) and other \nsubsidiaries. These activities are subject to \nregulations of the SEC, the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority and other authorities,   \nincluding state regulators. These regulations \ngenerally cover licensing of securities       \npersonnel, interactions with customers,       \ntrading operations and periodic examinations. \n                                              \nSecurities regulators impose capital          \nrequirements on USBII and monitor its         \nfinancial operations with periodic financial  \nreviews. In addition, USBII is a member of the\nSecurities Investor Protection Corporation,   \nwhich oversees the liquidation of member      \nbroker-dealers that close when the broker-    \ndealer is bankrupt or in financial trouble and\nimposes reporting requirements and assessments\non USBII.                                     \n                                              \nIn June 2019, the SEC issued a final rule,    \nreferred to as Regulation Best Interest, that \nimposed a new standard of conduct on SEC-     \nregistered broker-dealers when making         \nrecommendations to retail customers, and also \nissued an interpretation clarifying certain   \naspects of the fiduciary duty that an SEC-    \nregistered investment adviser owes to its     \nclients. In addition, the SEC issued a final  \nrule that requires broker-dealers and         \ninvestment advisers to provide a standardized \nsummary disclosure to retail customers        \ndescribing their relationship with and        \nservices offered by the broker-dealer or      \ninvestment adviser.                           \n                                              \nThe operations of the First American family of\nfunds, the Company\u2019s proprietary money market \nfund complex, also are subject to regulation  \nby the SEC, including rules requiring a       \nfloating net asset value for institutional    \nprime and tax-free money market funds and     \npermitting the board of directors of the money\nmarket funds the ability to limit redemptions \nduring periods of stress (allowing for the use\nof liquidity fees and redemption gates during \nsuch times).                                  \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s operations in the areas of      \ninsurance brokerage and reinsurance of credit \nlife insurance are subject to regulation and  \nsupervision by various state insurance        \nregulatory authorities, including the         \nlicensing of insurance brokers and agents.    \n                                              \nRegulation of Derivatives and the Swaps       \nMarketplace Under the Dodd-Frank Act, U.S.    \nBank National Association, as a CFTC          \nprovisionally-registered swap dealer, is      \nsubject to rules regarding the regulation of  \nthe swaps marketplace and over-the-counter    \nderivatives, including rules that require swap\ndealers and major swap participants to        \nregister with the CFTC, to meet robust        \nbusiness conduct standards to lower risk and  \npromote market integrity, to meet certain     \nrecordkeeping and reporting requirements so   \nthat regulators can better monitor the        \nmarkets, to centrally clear and trade swaps on\nregulated exchanges or execution facilities,  \nand to be subject to certain capital and      \nmargin requirements.                          \n                                              \nIn addition, the OCC has finalized a rule     \nconcerning swap margin and capital            \nrequirements for swap dealers regulated by the\nOCC.

The      \namount of margin will vary based on the       \nrelative risk of the non-cleared swap or non- \ncleared security-based swap. The rules for    \nvariation margin requirements have become     \neffective, and the rules for initial          \n                      16                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nmargin have become effective and will be fully\nphased-in on September\u00a01, 2021, depending on  \nthe level of derivatives activity of the swap \ndealer and the relevant counterparty. In June \n2020, the banking regulators finalized rules  \nto conform their margin rules on inter-       \naffiliate transactions to the CFTC\u2019s margin   \nrules, which generally exempt inter-affiliate \ntransactions from initial margin requirements \nto the extent a depository institution\u2019s total\nexposure to all affiliates is less than       \n15\u00a0percent of its tier 1 capital.             \n                                              \nThe Volcker Rule Section\u00a013 of the BHC Act and\nits implementing regulations, commonly        \nreferred to as the \u201cVolcker Rule,\u201d prohibit   \nbanking entities from engaging in proprietary \ntrading, and prohibits certain interests in,  \nor relationships with, hedge funds or private \nequity funds. The Volcker Rule applies to the \nCompany, U.S. Bank National Association and   \ntheir affiliates. The Company has a Volcker   \nRule compliance program in place that covers  \nall of its subsidiaries and affiliates,       \nincluding U.S. Bank National Association.     \n                                              \nIn October 2019, the Volcker Rule regulators  \nfinalized amendments, effective on January 1, \n2020, but with a required compliance date of  \nJanuary 1, 2021, to their regulations         \nimplementing the Volcker Rule, tailoring      \ncompliance requirements based on the size and \nscope of a banking entity\u2019s trading activities\nand clarifying and amending certain           \ndefinitions, requirements and exemptions. In  \naddition, in June 2020, the Volcker Rule      \nregulators finalized their previously proposed\namendments to the Volcker Rule\u2019s regulations  \nrelating to covered funds. These amendments   \nestablished new exclusions from covered fund  \nstatus for certain types of investment        \nvehicles, modified the eligibility criteria   \nfor certain existing exclusions, and clarified\nand modified other provisions governing       \nbanking entities\u2019 investments in and other    \ntransactions and relationships involving      \ncovered funds. In particular, these amendments\nclarified that banking entities are not       \nrequired to treat investments alongside       \ncovered funds as investments in covered funds \nsubject to certain limitations and if certain \nconditions are met. These amendments became   \neffective on October 1, 2020.                 \n                                              \nData Privacy and Cybersecurity Federal and    \nstate law contains extensive consumer privacy \nprotection provisions. The GLBA requires      \nfinancial institutions to periodically        \ndisclose their privacy policies and practices \nrelating to sharing such information and      \nenables retail customers to opt out of the    \nCompany\u2019s ability to share information with   \nunaffiliated third parties under certain      \ncircumstances. Other federal and state laws   \nand regulations impact the Company\u2019s ability  \nto share certain information with affiliates  \nand non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-  \nmarketing purposes, or to contact customers   \nwith marketing offers. The GLBA also requires \nfinancial institutions to implement a         \ncomprehensive information security program    \nthat includes administrative, technical and   \nphysical safeguards to ensure the security and\nconfidentiality of customer records and       \ninformation. These security and privacy       \npolicies and procedures for the protection of \npersonal and confidential information are in  \neffect across all businesses and geographic   \nlocations. Federal law also makes it a        \ncriminal offense, except in limited           \ncircumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain \ncustomer information of a financial nature by \nfraudulent or deceptive means.                \n                                              \nData privacy and data protection are areas of \nincreasing state legislative focus, and       \nseveral states have recently enacted consumer \nprivacy laws that impose compliance           \nobligations with respect to personal          \ninformation. For example, in June 2018, the   \nGovernor of California signed into law the    \nCalifornia Consumer Protection Act of 2018    \n(the \u201cCCPA\u201d). The CCPA, which became effective\non January\u00a01, 2020, applies to for-profit     \nbusinesses that conduct business in California\nand meet certain revenue or data collection   \nthresholds. The CCPA gives consumers the right\nto request disclosure of information collected\nabout them, and whether that information has  \nbeen sold or shared with others, the right to \nrequest deletion of personal information      \n(subject to certain exceptions), the right to \nopt out of the sale of the consumer\u2019s personal\ninformation, and the right not to be          \ndiscriminated against for exercising these    \nrights. The CCPA contains several exemptions, \nincluding an exemption applicable to          \ninformation that is collected, processed, sold\nor disclosed pursuant to the GLBA. In August  \n2020, the California Office of Administrative \nLaw approved the California Attorney General\u2019s\nregulations to implement the CCPA. These      \nregulations went into effect immediately. The \nCompany has a physical footprint in California\nand is required to comply with the CCPA and   \nits implementing regulations. In November     \n2020, voters in the State of California       \napproved the California Privacy Rights Act    \n(\u201cCPRA\u201d), a ballot measure that amends and    \nsupplements the CCPA by creating the          \nCalifornia Privacy Protection Agency, a       \n                      17                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nwatchdog privacy agency to be appointed       \nshortly after the CPRA\u2019s enactment. The CPRA  \nalso modifies the CCPA by expanding both the  \nscope of businesses covered by the law and    \ncertain rights relating to personal           \ninformation and its use, collection, and      \ndisclosure by covered businesses. In addition,\nsimilar laws may be adopted by other states   \nwhere the Company does business. The Company  \nhas made and will make operational adjustments\nin accordance with the requirements of the    \nCCPA and other state privacy laws. The federal\ngovernment may also pass data privacy or data \nprotection legislation. In addition, in the   \nEuropean Union (\u201cEU\u201d), privacy law is now     \ngoverned by the General Data Protection       \nRegulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which is directly binding\nand applicable for each EU member state since \nMay\u00a025, 2018. The GDPR contains enhanced      \ncompliance obligations and increased penalties\nfor non-compliance compared to the prior law  \ngoverning data privacy in the EU.             \n                                              \nLike other lenders, U.S. Bank National        \nAssociation and other subsidiaries of the     \nCompany use credit bureau data in their       \nunderwriting activities. Use of such data is  \nregulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act \n(\u201cFCRA\u201d), and the FCRA also regulates         \nreporting information to credit bureaus,      \nprescreening individuals for credit offers,   \nsharing of information between affiliates, and\nusing affiliate data for marketing purposes.  \nSimilar state laws may impose additional      \nrequirements on the Company and its           \nsubsidiaries.                                 \n                                              \nThe federal banking regulators, as well as the\nSEC, CFTC, and related self-regulatory        \norganizations, regularly issue guidance       \nregarding cybersecurity that is intended to   \nenhance cyber risk management among financial \ninstitutions. A financial institution is      \nexpected to establish lines of defense and to \nensure that their risk management processes   \nalso address the risk posed by potential      \nthreats to the institution. A financial       \ninstitution\u2019s management is expected to       \nmaintain sufficient business continuity       \nplanning processes to ensure the rapid        \nrecovery, resumption and maintenance of the   \ninstitution\u2019s operations after a cyber-attack.\nA financial institution is also expected to   \ndevelop appropriate processes to enable       \nrecovery of data and business operations if   \nthe institution or its critical service       \nproviders fall victim to a cyber-attack.      \n                                              \nIn December 2020, the United States federal   \nbank regulatory agencies released a proposed  \nrule regarding notification requirements for  \nbanking organizations related to significant  \ncomputer security incidents. Under the        \nproposal, a bank holding company, such as the \nCompany, and a national bank, such as U.S.    \nBank National Association, would be required  \nto notify the Federal Reserve or OCC,         \nrespectively, within 36 hours of incidents    \nthat could result in the banking              \norganization\u2019s inability to deliver services  \nto a material portion of its customer base,   \njeopardize the viability of key operations of \nthe banking organization, or impact the       \nstability of the financial sector. The effects\non the Company and U.S. National Bank         \nAssociation will depend on the final form of  \nthe rule and how it is implemented.           \n                                              \nConsumer Protection U.S. Bank National        \nAssociation\u2019s retail banking activities are   \nsubject to a variety of statutes and          \nregulations designed to protect consumers.    \nThese laws and regulations include the Truth- \nin-Lending, Truth-in-Savings, Home Mortgage   \nDisclosure, Equal Credit Opportunity, Fair    \nCredit Reporting, Fair Debt Collection        \nPractices, Real Estate Settlement Procedures, \nElectronic Funds Transfer, Right to Financial \nPrivacy and Servicemembers Civil Relief and   \nPayday Lending Acts. Interest and other       \ncharges collected or contracted for by banks  \nare subject to state usury laws and federal   \nlaws concerning interest rates. These and     \nother laws and regulations require, among     \nother things, disclosures of the cost of      \ncredit and terms of deposit accounts, provide \nsubstantive consumer rights, prohibit         \ndiscrimination in credit transactions,        \nregulate the use of credit report information,\nprovide financial privacy protections,        \nprohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive        \npractices and subject U.S. Bank National      \nAssociation to substantial regulatory         \noversight. Violations of applicable consumer  \nprotection laws can result in significant     \npotential liability from litigation brought by\ncustomers, including actual damages,          \nrestitution and attorneys\u2019 fees. U.S. Bank    \nNational Association\u2019s regulators may also    \nseek to enforce consumer protection           \nrequirements and obtain these and other       \nremedies, including regulatory sanctions and  \ncivil money penalties. Failure to comply with \nconsumer protection requirements may also     \nresult in significant reputational harm.      \n                                              \nU.S. Bank National Association and its        \nsubsidiaries are subject to supervision and   \nregulation by the CFPB with respect to federal\nconsumer laws, including many of the consumer \nprotection laws and regulations described     \n                      18                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nabove. The CFPB has undertaken numerous rule- \nmaking and other initiatives, including       \nissuing informal guidance and taking          \nenforcement actions against certain financial \ninstitutions. The CFPB\u2019s rulemaking,          \nexamination and enforcement authority has     \naffected and will continue to impact financial\ninstitutions involved in the provision of     \nconsumer financial products and services,     \nincluding the Company, U.S. Bank National     \nAssociation, and the Company\u2019s other          \nsubsidiaries. These regulatory activities may \nlimit the types of financial services and     \nproducts the Company may offer, which in turn \nmay reduce the Company\u2019s revenues. Other      \nSupervision and RegulationThe Company is      \nsubject to the disclosure and regulatory      \nrequirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, and the Securities Exchange Act of   \n1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), both as\nadministered by the SEC, by virtue of the     \nCompany\u2019s status as a public company.
