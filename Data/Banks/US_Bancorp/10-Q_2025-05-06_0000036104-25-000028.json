2025, or\n$1.03 per diluted\ncommon share, compared\nwith $1.3 billion, or\n$0.78 per diluted\ncommon share, for the\nfirst quarter of 2024.\nReturn on average\nassets and return on\naverage common equity\nwere 1.04 percent and\n12.3 percent,\nrespectively, for the\nfirst quarter of 2025,\ncompared with 0.81\npercent and 10.0\npercent, respectively,\nfor the first quarter\nof 2024. The results\nfor the first quarter\nof 2024 included the\nimpact of $265 million\n($199 million net-of-\ntax) of notable items,\nincluding $155 million\nof merger and\nintegration charges\nassociated with the\nacquisition of MUFG\nUnion Bank, N.A.\n(\u201cMUB\u201d) and $110\nmillion of incremental\nFDIC special\nassessment charges,\nwhich decreased\ndiluted earnings per\ncommon share for the\nfirst quarter of 2024\nby $0.12.\n\nTotal net revenue for\nthe first quarter of\n2025 was $243 million\n(3.6 percent) higher\nthan the first quarter\nof 2024, reflecting a\n2.7 percent increase\nin net interest income\nand a 5.0 percent\nincrease in\nnoninterest income.\nThe increase in net\ninterest income from\nthe first quarter of\n2024 was primarily due\nto the mix of earning\nassets, fixed asset\nrepricing and modest\nloan growth, partially\noffset by deposit mix.\nThe increase in\nnoninterest income was\ndriven by higher trust\nand investment\nmanagement fees,\npayment services\nrevenue and other\nnoninterest income.\n\nNoninterest expense in\nthe first quarter of\n2025 was $227 million\n(5.1 percent) lower\nthan the first quarter\nof 2024, primarily due\nto the impact of\nmerger and integration\ncharges in the prior\nyear and lower\ncompensation and\nemployee benefits\nexpense, partially\noffset by higher\nmarketing and business\ndevelopment expense\nand technology and\ncommunications\nexpense.\n\nThe provision for\ncredit losses for the\nfirst quarter of 2025\nwas $16 million (2.9\npercent) lower than\nthe first quarter of\n2024, driven by\nimproved credit\nquality and loan\nportfolio mix, which\ncontributed to a $10\nmillion reserve\nrelease in the first\nquarter of 2025. Net\ncharge-offs in the\nfirst quarter of 2025\nwere $547 million,\ncompared with $488\nmillion in the first\nquarter of 2024.

The net\ninterest margin, on a\ntaxable-equivalent\nbasis, in the first\nquarter of 2025 was\n2.72 percent, compared\nwith 2.70 percent in\nthe first quarter of\n2024. The increase in\nnet interest margin\nfrom the first quarter\nof 2024 was primarily\ndue to improved\nbalance sheet mix,\nfixed asset repricing\nand modest loan\ngrowth, partially\noffset by deposit mix\nand higher earning\nassets. Refer to the\n\u201cConsolidated Daily\nAverage Balance Sheet\nand Related Yields and\nRates\u201d table for\nfurther information on\nnet interest income.\n\nAverage total loans in\nthe first quarter of\n2025 were $8.0 billion\n(2.1 percent) higher\nthan the first quarter\nof 2024. The increase\nwas primarily due to\nhigher commercial\nloans, residential\nmortgages and credit\ncard loans, partially\noffset by lower\ncommercial real estate\nloans and other retail\nloans. The increase in\naverage commercial\nloans was primarily\ndue to growth in loans\nto financial\ninstitutions. The\nincrease in\nresidential mortgages\nwas primarily driven\nby originations. The\nincrease in average\ncredit card loans was\nprimarily driven by\ncustomer account\ngrowth and higher\nspend volume. The\ndecrease in average\ncommercial real estate\nloans was primarily\ndue to loan workout\nactivities and payoffs\nexceeding a reduced\nlevel of new\noriginations. The\ndecrease in average\nother retail loans was\ndriven by lower\nautomobile loans.\n\nAverage investment\nsecurities in the\nfirst quarter of 2025\nwere $9.9 billion (6.2\npercent) higher than\nthe first quarter of\n2024, primarily due to\nbalance sheet\npositioning and\nliquidity management.\n\nAverage total deposits\nfor the first quarter\nof 2025 were $3.5\nbillion (0.7 percent)\nhigher than the first\nquarter of 2024.\nAverage total savings\ndeposits for the first\nquarter of 2025 were\n$8.2 billion (2.3\npercent) higher than\nthe first quarter of\n2024, driven by\nincreases in Wealth,\nCorporate, Commercial\nand Institutional\nBanking, and Consumer\nand Business Banking\nbalances. Average time\ndeposits for the first\nquarter of 2025 were\n$358 million (0.6\npercent) higher than\nthe first quarter of\n2024, mainly due to\nincreases in Consumer\nand Business Banking\nbalances, partially\noffset by decreases in\nWealth, Corporate,\nCommercial and\nInstitutional Banking\nbalances. Changes in\ntime deposits are\nprimarily related to\nthose deposits managed\nas an alternative to\nother funding sources,\nbased largely on\nrelative pricing and\nliquidity\ncharacteristics.\nAverage noninterest-\nbearing deposits for\nthe first quarter of\n2025 were $5.1 billion\n(6.0 percent) lower\nthan the first quarter\nof 2024, driven by\ndecreases in Wealth,\nCorporate, Commercial\nand Institutional\nBanking, and Consumer\nand Business Banking\nbalances.\n\nProvision for Credit\nLosses The provision\nfor credit losses was\n$537 million in the\nfirst quarter of 2025,\nrepresenting a\ndecrease of $16\nmillion (2.9 percent)\nfrom the first quarter\nof 2024, primarily\ndriven by improved\ncredit quality and\nloan portfolio mix,\nwhich contributed to a\n$10 million reserve\nrelease in the first\nquarter of 2025. Net\ncharge-offs increased\n$59 million (12.1\npercent) in the first\nquarter of 2025,\ncompared with the\nfirst quarter of 2024,\nreflecting higher\ncommercial and credit\ncard loan net charge-\noffs.

Payment\nservices revenue\nincreased primarily\ndue to increases\nacross all categories\ndue to business volume\ngrowth. The increase\nin card revenue was\npartially offset by a\nreduction in prepaid\ncard volumes from the\nprior year. Other\nnoninterest income\nincreased primarily\ndue to higher tax\ncredit investment\nactivity and the\nimpact of other\nfavorable items.\n\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense\nwas $4.2 billion in\nthe first quarter of\n2025, representing a\ndecrease of $227\n\nmillion (5.1 percent)\nfrom the first quarter\nof 2024. The decrease\nin noninterest expense\nreflected the impact\nof merger and\nintegration charges in\nthe prior year, along\nwith lower\ncompensation and\nemployee benefits\nexpense and lower\nother noninterest\nexpense, partially\noffset by higher\nmarketing and business\ndevelopment expense\nand higher technology\nand communications\nexpense. Compensation\nand employee benefits\nexpense decreased\nprimarily due to cost\nsavings from\noperational\nefficiencies,\npartially offset by\nmerit increases. Other\nnoninterest expense\ndecreased primarily\ndue to the impact of\nthe FDIC special\nassessment in the\nprior year. Marketing\nand business\ndevelopment expense\nincreased primarily\ndue to a higher\ncharitable foundation\ncontribution.\nTechnology and\ncommunications expense\nincreased primarily\ndue to investments in\ninfrastructure and\ntechnology\ndevelopment.\n\nIncome Tax Expense The\nprovision for income\ntaxes was $443 million\n(an effective rate of\n20.5 percent) for the\nfirst quarter of 2025,\ncompared with $347\nmillion (an effective\nrate of 20.7 percent)\nfor the first quarter\nof 2024.

\nLoans The Company\u2019s\nloan portfolio was\n$381.8 billion at\nMarch 31, 2025,\ncompared with $379.8\nbillion at December\n31, 2024, an increase\nof $2.0 billion (0.5\npercent). The increase\nwas driven by higher\ncommercial loans,\npartially offset by\nlower credit card\nloans and other retail\nloans.\n\nCommercial loans\nincreased $4.6 billion\n(3.3 percent) at March\n31, 2025, compared\nwith December 31,\n2024, primarily due to\ngrowth in loans to\nfinancial\ninstitutions.\n\nResidential mortgages\nheld in the loan\nportfolio increased\n$94 million (0.1\npercent) at March 31,\n2025, compared with\nDecember 31, 2024,\ndriven by\noriginations.\nResidential mortgages\noriginated and placed\nin the Company\u2019s loan\nportfolio include\njumbo mortgages and\nbranch-originated\nfirst lien home equity\nloans to borrowers\nwith high credit\nquality.\n\nCredit card loans\ndecreased $1.1 billion\n(3.7 percent) at March\n31, 2025, compared\nwith December 31,\n2024, primarily the\nresult of customers\nseasonally paying down\nbalances.\n\nOther retail loans\ndecreased $1.1 billion\n(2.5 percent) at March\n31, 2025, compared\nwith December 31,\n2024, primarily due to\na decrease in\nautomobile loans.\n\nCommercial real estate\nloans decreased $525\nmillion (1.1 percent)\nat March 31, 2025,\ncompared with December\n31, 2024, primarily\ndue to loan workout\nactivities and payoffs\nexceeding a reduced\nlevel of new\noriginations.\n\nThe Company generally\nretains portfolio\nloans through\nmaturity; however, the\nCompany\u2019s intent may\nchange over time based\nupon various factors\nsuch as ongoing\nasset/liability\nmanagement activities,\nassessment of product\nprofitability, credit\nrisk, liquidity needs,\nand capital\nimplications. If the\nCompany\u2019s intent or\nability to hold an\nexisting portfolio\nloan changes, it is\ntransferred to loans\nheld for sale.\n\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans held for sale,\nconsisting primarily\nof residential\nmortgages to be sold\nin the secondary\nmarket, were $1.7\nbillion at March 31,\n2025, compared with\n$2.6 billion at\nDecember 31, 2024. The\ndecrease in loans held\nfor sale was\nprincipally due to a\nlower level of\nmortgage loan closings\n\nin the first quarter\nof 2025, compared with\nthe fourth quarter of\n2024. Almost all of\nthe residential\nmortgage loans the\nCompany originates or\npurchases for sale\nfollow guidelines that\nallow the loans to be\nsold into existing,\nhighly liquid\nsecondary markets, in\nparticular in\ngovernment agency\ntransactions and to\ngovernment sponsored\nenterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d).\n\nInvestment Securities\nInvestment securities\ntotaled $164.8 billion\nat March 31, 2025,\ncompared with $164.6\nbillion at December\n31, 2024. The $156\nmillion (0.1 percent)\nincrease was primarily\ndue to a $508 million\nfavorable change in\nnet unrealized gains\n(losses) on available-\nfor-sale investment\nsecurities, partially\noffset by net\ninvestment securities\nsales driven by\nbalance sheet\npositioning and\nliquidity management.\n\nThe Company\u2019s\navailable-for-sale\ninvestment securities\nare carried at fair\nvalue with changes in\nfair value reflected\nin other comprehensive\nincome (loss) unless a\nportion of a\nsecurity\u2019s unrealized\nloss is related to\ncredit and an\nallowance for credit\nlosses is necessary.\nAt March 31, 2025, the\nCompany\u2019s net\nunrealized losses on\navailable-for-sale\ninvestment securities\nwere $6.3 billion\n($4.7 billion net-of-\ntax), compared with\nnet unrealized losses\nof $6.8 billion ($5.1\nbillion net-of-tax) at\nDecember 31, 2024. The\nfavorable change in\nnet unrealized gains\n(losses) was primarily\ndue to increases in\nthe fair value of U.S.\ntreasury and mortgage-\nbacked securities as a\nresult of changes in\ninterest rates. Gross\nunrealized losses on\navailable-for-sale\ninvestment securities\ntotaled $6.4 billion\nat March 31, 2025,\ncompared with $6.9\nbillion at December\n31, 2024. When\nevaluating credit\nlosses, the Company\nconsiders various\nfactors such as the\nnature of the\ninvestment security,\nthe credit ratings or\nfinancial condition of\nthe issuer, the extent\nof the unrealized\nloss, expected cash\nflows of the\nunderlying collateral,\nthe existence of any\ngovernment or agency\nguarantees, and market\nconditions. At March\n31, 2025, the Company\nhad no plans to sell\nsecurities with\nunrealized losses, and\nbelieved it was more\nlikely than not that\nit would not be\nrequired to sell such\nsecurities before\nrecovery of their\namortized cost.\n                     \n  6    U.S. Bancorp  \n                     \nRefer to Notes 3 and\n14 in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements for further\ninformation on\ninvestment securities.\n\nDeposits Total\ndeposits were $512.5\nbillion at March 31,\n2025, compared with\n$518.3 billion at\nDecember 31, 2024. The\n$5.8 billion (1.1\npercent) decrease in\ntotal deposits\nreflected decreases in\ntotal savings deposits\nand noninterest-\nbearing deposits,\npartially offset by an\nincrease in time\ndeposits. Money market\ndeposit balances\ndecreased $21.1\nbillion (10.2\npercent), primarily\ndue to lower Wealth,\nCorporate, Commercial\nand Institutional\nBanking, and Consumer\nand Business Banking\nbalances. Savings\naccount balances\nincreased $10.0\nbillion (22.0\npercent), driven by\nhigher Consumer and\nBusiness Banking\nbalances. Interest\nchecking balances\nincreased $4.9 billion\n(3.8 percent),\nprimarily due to\nhigher Wealth,\nCorporate, Commercial\nand Institutional\nBanking, and Consumer\nand Business Banking\nbalances. Noninterest-\nbearing deposits\ndecreased $72 million\n(0.1 percent) at March\n31, 2025, compared\nwith December 31,\n2024, primarily driven\nby a decrease in\nWealth, Corporate,\nCommercial and\nInstitutional Banking\nbalances, partially\noffset by an increase\nin Consumer and\nBusiness Banking\nbalances. Time\ndeposits increased\n$476 million (0.9\npercent) at\n\nMarch 31, 2025,\ncompared with December\n31, 2024, driven by\nhigher Consumer and\nBusiness Banking\nbalances. Changes in\ntime deposits are\nprimarily related to\nthose deposits managed\nas an alternative to\nother funding sources,\nbased largely on\nrelative pricing and\nliquidity\ncharacteristics.\n\nBorrowings The Company\nutilizes both short-\nterm and long-term\nborrowings as part of\nits asset/liability\nmanagement and funding\nstrategies. Short-term\nborrowings, which\ninclude federal funds\npurchased, commercial\npaper, repurchase\nagreements, borrowings\nsecured by high-grade\nassets and other\nshort-term borrowings,\nwere $17.2 billion at\nMarch 31, 2025,\ncompared with $15.5\nbillion at December\n31, 2024. The $1.6\nbillion (10.6 percent)\nincrease in short-term\nborrowings was\nprimarily due to\nincreases in\nrepurchase agreement\nbalances, partially\noffset by a decrease\nin short-term Federal\nHome Loan Bank\n(\u201cFHLB\u201d) advances.\nLong-term debt was\n$59.9 billion at March\n31, 2025, compared\nwith $58.0 billion at\nDecember 31, 2024. The\n$1.9 billion (3.2\npercent) increase was\nprimarily due to $3.0\nbillion of medium-term\nnote and $625 million\nof credit-linked bank\nnote issuances,\npartially offset by\n$2.0 billion of bank\nnote repayments.

The\nCompany\u2019s Board of\nDirectors has approved\na risk management\nframework which\nestablishes governance\nand risk management\nrequirements for all\nrisk-taking\nactivities. This\nframework includes\nCompany and business\nline risk appetite\nstatements which set\nboundaries for the\ntypes and amount of\nrisk that may be\nundertaken in pursuing\nbusiness objectives\nand initiatives. The\nBoard of Directors,\nprimarily through its\nRisk Management\nCommittee, oversees\nperformance relative\nto the risk management\nframework, risk\nappetite statements,\nand other policy\nrequirements.\n\nThe Executive Risk\nCommittee (\u201cERC\u201d),\nwhich is chaired by\nthe Chief Risk Officer\nand includes the Chief\nExecutive Officer and\nother members of the\nexecutive management\nteam, oversees\nexecution against the\nrisk management\nframework and risk\nappetite statements.\nThe ERC focuses on\ncurrent and emerging\nrisks, including\nstrategic and\nreputation risks, by\ndirecting timely and\ncomprehensive actions.\nSenior operating\ncommittees have also\nbeen established, each\nresponsible for\noverseeing a specified\ncategory of risk.\n\nThe Company\u2019s most\nprominent risk\nexposures are credit,\ninterest rate, market,\nliquidity,\noperational,\ncompliance, strategic,\nand reputation. Credit\nrisk is the risk of\nloss associated with a\nchange in the credit\nprofile or the failure\nof a borrower or\ncounterparty to meet\nits contractual\nobligations. Interest\nrate risk is the\ncurrent or prospective\nrisk to earnings and\ncapital, or market\nvaluations, arising\nfrom the impact of\nchanges in interest\nrates. Market risk is\nthe risk associated\nwith fluctuations in\ninterest rates,\nforeign exchange\nrates, commodities and\ncredit spreads that\nmay result in changes\nin the values of\nfinancial instruments,\nsuch as trading and\navailable-for-sale\ninvestment securities,\nmortgage loans held\nfor sale (\u201cMLHFS\u201d),\nmortgage servicing\nrights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) and\nderivatives that are\naccounted for on a\nfair value basis.\nLiquidity risk is the\nrisk that financial\ncondition or overall\nsafety and soundness\nis adversely affected\nby the Company\u2019s\ninability, or\nperceived inability,\nto meet its cash flow\nobligations in a\ntimely and complete\nmanner in either\nnormal or stressed\nconditions.\nOperational risk is\nthe risk to current or\nprojected financial\ncondition and\nresilience arising\nfrom inadequate or\nfailed internal\nprocesses or systems,\npeople (including\nhuman errors or\nmisconduct), or\nadverse external\nevents, including the\nrisk of loss resulting\nfrom breaches in data\nsecurity. Operational\nrisk can also include\nthe risk of loss due\nto failures by third\nparties with which the\nCompany does business.\nCompliance risk is the\nrisk that the Company\nmay suffer legal or\nregulatory sanctions,\nfinancial losses, and\nreputational damage if\nit fails to adhere to\ncompliance\nrequirements and the\nCompany\u2019s compliance\npolicies. Strategic\nrisk is the risk to\ncurrent or projected\nfinancial condition\nand resilience arising\nfrom adverse business\ndecisions, poor\nimplementation of\nbusiness decisions, or\nlack of responsiveness\nto changes in the\nbanking industry and\noperating environment.\nReputation risk is the\nrisk to current or\nprojected financial\ncondition and\nresilience arising\nfrom negative public\nopinion. This risk may\nimpair the Company\u2019s\ncompetitiveness by\naffecting its ability\nto establish new\nrelationships or\nservices, or continue\nservicing existing\n\nrelationships. In\naddition to the risks\nidentified above,\nother risk factors\nexist that may impact\nthe Company. Refer to\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d in the\nCompany\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024, for\na detailed discussion\nof these factors.\n\nThe Company\u2019s Board\nand management-level\ngovernance committees\nare supported by a\n\u201cthree lines of\ndefense\u201d model for\nestablishing effective\nchecks and balances.\nThe first line of\ndefense, the business\nlines, manages risks\nin conformity with\nestablished limits and\npolicy requirements.\nIn turn, business line\nleaders and their risk\nofficers establish\nprograms to ensure\nconformity with these\nlimits and policy\nrequirements. The\nsecond line of\ndefense, which\nincludes the Chief\nRisk Officer\u2019s\norganization as well\nas policy and\noversight activities\nof corporate support\nfunctions, translates\nrisk appetite and\nstrategy into\nactionable risk limits\nand policies. The\nsecond line of defense\nmonitors first line of\ndefense conformity\nwith limits and\npolicies and provides\nreporting and\nescalation of emerging\nrisks and other\nconcerns to senior\nmanagement and the\nRisk Management\nCommittee of the Board\nof Directors. The\nthird line of defense,\ninternal audit, is\nresponsible for\nproviding the Audit\nCommittee of the Board\nof Directors and\nsenior management with\nindependent assessment\nand assurance\nregarding the\neffectiveness of the\nCompany\u2019s governance,\nrisk management and\ncontrol processes.\n\nManagement regularly\nprovides reports to\nthe Risk Management\nCommittee of the Board\nof Directors. The Risk\nManagement Committee\ndiscusses with\nmanagement the\nCompany\u2019s risk\nmanagement performance\nand provides a summary\nof key risks to the\nentire Board of\nDirectors, covering\nthe status of existing\nmatters, areas of\npotential future\nconcern and specific\ninformation on certain\ntypes of loss events.\nThe Risk Management\nCommittee considers\nquarterly reports by\nmanagement assessing\nthe Company\u2019s\nperformance relative\nto the risk appetite\nstatements and the\nassociated risk\nlimits, including:\n\n\u2022 Macroeconomic\nenvironment and other\nqualitative\nconsiderations, such\nas regulatory and\ncompliance changes,\nlitigation\ndevelopments,\ngeopolitical events,\nand technology and\ncybersecurity;\n\n\u2022 Credit measures,\nincluding adversely\nrated and\nnonperforming loans,\nleveraged\ntransactions, credit\nconcentrations and\nlending limits;\n\n\u2022 Interest rate and\nmarket risk, including\nmarket value and net\nincome simulation, and\ntrading-related Value\nat Risk (\u201cVaR\u201d);\n\n\u2022 Liquidity risk,\nincluding funding\nprojections under\nvarious stressed\nscenarios;\n\n\u2022 Operational and\ncompliance risk,\nincluding losses\nstemming from events\nsuch as fraud,\nprocessing errors,\ncontrol breaches,\nbreaches in data\nsecurity or adverse\nbusiness decisions, as\nwell as reporting on\ntechnology\nperformance, and\nvarious legal and\nregulatory compliance\nmeasures;\n\n\u2022 Capital ratios and\nprojections, including\nregulatory measures\nand stressed\nscenarios; and\n\n\u2022 Strategic and\nreputation risk\nconsiderations,\nimpacts and responses.\n                     \n  8    U.S. Bancorp  \n                     \nCredit Risk Management\nThe Company\u2019s strategy\nfor credit risk\nmanagement includes\nwell-defined,\ncentralized credit\npolicies, uniform\nunderwriting criteria,\nand ongoing risk\nmonitoring and review\nprocesses for all\ncommercial and\nconsumer credit\nexposures. The\nstrategy also\nemphasizes\ndiversification on a\ngeographic, industry\nand customer level,\nregular credit\nexaminations and\nmanagement reviews of\nloans exhibiting\ndeterioration of\ncredit quality. In\nevaluating its credit\nrisk, the Company\nconsiders changes, if\nany, in underwriting\nactivities, the loan\nportfolio composition\n(including product mix\nand geographic,\nindustry or customer-\nspecific factors),\ncollateral values,\ntrends in loan\nperformance and\nmacroeconomic factors,\nsuch as changes in\nunemployment rates,\ngross domestic product\nlevels, inflation,\ninterest rates and\nconsumer bankruptcy\nfilings. The Risk\nManagement Committee\noversees the Company\u2019s\ncredit risk management\nprocess.\n\nIn addition, credit\nquality ratings, as\ndefined by the\nCompany, are an\nimportant part of the\nCompany\u2019s overall\ncredit risk management\nand evaluation of its\nallowance for credit\nlosses. Loans with a\npass rating represent\nthose loans not\nclassified on the\nCompany\u2019s rating scale\nfor problem credits,\nas minimal credit risk\nhas been identified.\nLoans with a special\nmention or classified\nrating (defined by\ninternally assessed\nrating or exception\nbased monitoring\ncredits in consumer\nlending and small\nbusiness loans that\nare 90 days or more\npast due and still\naccruing, nonaccrual\nloans and loans in a\njunior lien position\nthat are current but\nare behind a first\nlien position on\nnonaccrual) encompass\nall loans held by the\nCompany that it\nconsiders to have a\npotential or well-\ndefined weakness that\nmay put full\ncollection of\ncontractual cash flows\nat risk. The Company\u2019s\ninternal credit\nquality ratings for\nconsumer loans are\nprimarily based on\ndelinquency and\nnonperforming status.\nRefer to Note 4 in the\nNotes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements\nfor further discussion\nof the Company\u2019s loan\nportfolios including\ninternal credit\nquality ratings. In\naddition, refer to\n\u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis \u2014 Credit Risk\nManagement\u201d in the\nCompany\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024, for\na more detailed\ndiscussion on credit\nrisk management\nprocesses.\n\nThe Company manages\nits credit risk, in\npart, through\ndiversification of its\nloan portfolio, which\nis achieved through\nlimit setting by\nproduct type criteria,\nsuch as industry,\ngeography and\nidentification of\ncredit concentrations.\nThe Company\ncategorizes its loan\nportfolio into two\nsegments, which is the\nlevel at which it\ndevelops and documents\na systematic\nmethodology to\ndetermine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses. The Company\u2019s\ntwo loan portfolio\nsegments are\ncommercial lending and\nconsumer lending.\n\nThe commercial lending\nsegment includes loans\nand leases made to\nsmall business, middle\nmarket, large\ncorporate, commercial\nreal estate, financial\ninstitution, non-\nprofit and public\nsector customers. Key\nrisk characteristics\nrelevant to commercial\nlending segment loans\ninclude the industry\nand geography of the\nborrower\u2019s business,\npurpose of the loan,\nrepayment source,\nborrower\u2019s debt\ncapacity and financial\nflexibility, loan\ncovenants, and nature\nof pledged collateral,\nif any, as well as\nmacroeconomic factors\nsuch as unemployment\nrates, gross domestic\nproduct levels,\ncorporate bond spreads\nand long-term interest\nrates. These risk\n\ncharacteristics, among\nothers, are considered\nin determining\nestimates about the\nlikelihood of default\nby the borrowers and\nthe severity of loss\nin the event of\ndefault. The Company\nconsiders these risk\ncharacteristics in\nassigning internal\nrisk ratings to, or\nforecasting losses on,\nthese loans, which are\nthe significant\nfactors in determining\nthe allowance for\ncredit losses for\nloans in the\ncommercial lending\nsegment.\n\nThe consumer lending\nsegment represents\nloans and leases made\nto consumer customers,\nincluding residential\nmortgages, credit card\nloans, and other\nretail loans such as\nrevolving consumer\nlines, auto loans and\nleases and home equity\nloans and lines. Key\nrisk characteristics\nrelevant to consumer\nlending segment loans\nprimarily relate to\nthe borrowers\u2019\ncapacity and\nwillingness to repay,\ncustomer payment\nhistory and credit\nscores and consider\nmacroeconomic factors\nsuch as unemployment\nrates, consumer\nbankruptcy filings,\nhousehold debt levels,\nreal disposable\nincome, effect of\nhigher interest rates\non variable rate or\nadjustable rate loans,\nand in some cases,\nupdated loan-to-value\n(\u201cLTV\u201d) information\nreflecting current\nmarket conditions on\nsecured loans. These\nand other risk\ncharacteristics are\nreflected in forecasts\nof delinquency levels,\nbankruptcies and\nlosses which are the\nprimary factors in\ndetermining the\nallowance for credit\nlosses for the\nconsumer lending\nsegment.\n\nThe Company further\ndisaggregates its loan\nportfolio segments\ninto various classes\nbased on their\nunderlying risk\ncharacteristics. The\ntwo classes within the\ncommercial lending\nsegment are commercial\nloans and commercial\nreal estate loans. The\nthree classes within\nthe consumer lending\nsegment are\nresidential mortgages,\ncredit card loans and\nother retail loans.\n\nThe Company\u2019s consumer\nlending segment\noriginates consumer\ncredit through several\nchannels, including\ntraditional branch\nlending, mobile and\nonline banking,\nindirect lending,\nalliance partnerships\nand correspondent\nbanks. Each distinct\nunderwriting and\norigination process\nwithin consumer\nlending manages unique\ncredit risk\ncharacteristics and\nprices its loan\nproduction\ncommensurate with the\ndiffering risk\nprofiles.\n\nResidential mortgage\noriginations are\ngenerally limited to\nprime borrowers and\nare performed through\nthe Company\u2019s\nbranches, loan\nproduction offices,\nmobile and online\nservices, and a\nwholesale network of\noriginators. The\nCompany may retain\nresidential mortgage\nloans it originates on\nits balance sheet or\nsell the loans into\nthe secondary market\nwhile retaining the\nservicing rights and\ncustomer\nrelationships.\nUtilizing the\nsecondary markets\nenables the Company to\neffectively reduce its\ncredit and other\nasset/liability risks.\nFor residential\nmortgages that are\nretained in the\nCompany\u2019s portfolio\nand for home equity\nand second mortgages,\ncredit risk is managed\nby adherence to LTV\nand borrower credit\ncriteria during the\nunderwriting process.\n\nThe Company estimates\nupdated LTV\ninformation on its\noutstanding\nresidential mortgages\nquarterly, based on a\nmethod that combines\nautomated valuation\nmodel updates and\nrelevant home price\nindices. LTV is the\nratio of the loan\u2019s\noutstanding principal\nbalance to the current\nestimate of property\nvalue. For home equity\nand second mortgages,\ncombined loan-to-value\n(\u201cCLTV\u201d) is the\ncombination of the\nfirst mortgage\noriginal principal\nbalance and the second\nlien\n                     \n  U.S. Bancorp    9  \n                     \noutstanding principal\nbalance, relative to\nthe current estimate\nof property value.\nCertain loans do not\nhave an LTV or CLTV,\nprimarily due to lack\nof availability of\nrelevant automated\nvaluation model and/or\nhome price indices\nvalues, or lack of\nnecessary valuation\ndata on acquired\nloans. The following\ntables provide summary\ninformation of\nresidential mortgages\nand home equity and\nsecond mortgages by\nLTV at March 31, 2025:\n                                              \n  \u2026

wildfires.\n\n(c) Includes revolving\ncredit, installment\nand automobile loans.\n\nModified Loans In\ncertain circumstances,\nthe Company may modify\nthe terms of a loan to\nmaximize the\ncollection of amounts\ndue when a borrower is\nexperiencing financial\ndifficulties or is\nexpected to experience\ndifficulties in the\nnear-term. In most\ncases the modification\nis either a\nconcessionary\nreduction in interest\nrate, extension of the\nmaturity date or other\nconcessionary\nmodification of loan\nterms that would\notherwise not be\nconsidered.\n\nModified loans accrue\ninterest if the\nborrower complies with\nthe revised terms and\nconditions and has\ndemonstrated repayment\nperformance at a level\ncommensurate with the\nmodified terms over\nseveral payment\ncycles, which is\ngenerally six months\nor greater.\n\nThe Company continues\nto work with borrowers\nwho are experiencing\nfinancial difficulties\nto modify their loans.\nMany of the Company\u2019s\nloan modifications are\ndetermined on a case-\nby-case basis in\nconnection with\nongoing loan\ncollection processes.\nThe modifications vary\nwithin each of the\nCompany\u2019s loan\nclasses. Commercial\nlending segment\nmodifications\ngenerally include\nextensions of the\nmaturity date and may\nbe accompanied by an\nincrease or decrease\nto the interest rate.\nThe Company may also\nwork with the borrower\nto\n\nmake other changes to\nthe loan to mitigate\nlosses, such as\nobtaining additional\ncollateral and/or\nguarantees to support\nthe loan.\n\nThe Company has also\nimplemented certain\nresidential mortgage\nloan modification\nprograms. The Company\nmodifies residential\nmortgage loans under\nFederal Housing\nAdministration, United\nStates Department of\nVeterans Affairs, and\nits own internal\nprograms. Under these\nprograms, the Company\noffers qualifying\nhomeowners the\nopportunity to\npermanently modify\ntheir loan and achieve\nmore affordable\nmonthly payments.\nThese modifications\nmay include\nadjustments to\ninterest rates,\nconversion of\nadjustable rates to\nfixed rates,\nextensions of maturity\ndates or deferrals of\npayments,\ncapitalization of\naccrued interest\nand/or outstanding\nadvances, or in\nlimited situations,\npartial forgiveness of\nloan principal. In\nsome instances,\nparticipation in\nresidential mortgage\nloan modification\nprograms requires the\ncustomer to complete a\nshort-term trial\nperiod. A permanent\nloan modification is\ncontingent on the\ncustomer successfully\ncompleting the trial\nperiod arrangement,\nand the loan documents\nare not modified until\nthat time.\n                      \n  12    U.S. Bancorp  \n                      \nCredit card and other\nretail loan\nmodifications are\ngenerally part of\ndistinct modification\nprograms providing\ncustomers modification\nsolutions over a\nspecified time period,\ngenerally up to 60\nmonths.\n\nThe Company also makes\nshort-term\nmodifications, in\nlimited circumstances,\nto assist borrowers\nexperiencing temporary\nhardships. Short-term\nconsumer lending\nmodification programs\ninclude payment\nreductions, deferrals\nof up to three past\ndue payments, and the\nability to return to\ncurrent status if the\nborrower makes\nrequired payments. The\nCompany may also make\nshort-term\nmodifications to\ncommercial lending\nloans, with the most\ncommon modification\nbeing an extension of\nthe maturity date of\nthree months or less.\nSuch extensions\ngenerally are used\nwhen the maturity date\nis imminent and the\nborrower is\nexperiencing some\nlevel of financial\nstress, but the\nCompany believes the\nborrower will pay all\ncontractual amounts\nowed. During January\n2025, wildfires caused\nsubstantial damage and\ndisruption to the Los\nAngeles area. The\nCompany has programs\navailable to work with\nimpacted customers and\nsupport the community.\nThe Company continues\nto monitor the\npotential impacts on\nits customers and\nfinancial statements\nas the situation\nevolves.

charge-offs were\n$547 million for the\nfirst quarter of 2025,\ncompared with $488\nmillion for the first\nquarter of 2024. The\nincrease reflected\nhigher commercial and\ncredit card loan net\ncharge-offs. The ratio\nof total loan net\ncharge-offs to average\nloans outstanding on\nan annualized basis\nfor the first quarter\nof 2025 was 0.59\npercent, compared with\n0.53 percent for the\nfirst quarter of 2024.\n\nAnalysis and\nDetermination of the\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses The allowance\nfor credit losses is\nestablished for\ncurrent expected\ncredit losses on the\nCompany\u2019s loan and\nlease portfolio,\nincluding unfunded\ncredit commitments.\nThe allowance\nconsiders expected\nlosses for the\nremaining lives of the\napplicable assets,\ninclusive of expected\nrecoveries. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses is increased\nthrough provisions\ncharged to earnings\nand reduced by net\ncharge-offs.\n\nManagement evaluates\nthe appropriateness of\nthe allowance for\ncredit losses on a\nquarterly basis.\nMultiple economic\nscenarios are\nconsidered over a\nthree-year reasonable\nand supportable\nforecast period, which\nincludes increasing\nconsideration of\nhistorical loss\nexperience over years\ntwo and three. These\neconomic scenarios are\nconstructed with\ninterrelated\nprojections of\nmultiple economic\nvariables, and loss\nestimates are produced\nthat consider the\nhistorical correlation\nof those economic\nvariables with credit\nlosses. After the\nforecast period, the\nCompany fully reverts\nto long-term\nhistorical loss\nexperience, adjusted\nfor prepayments and\ncharacteristics of the\ncurrent loan and lease\nportfolio, to estimate\nlosses over the\nremaining life of the\nportfolio. The\neconomic scenarios are\nupdated at least\nquarterly and are\ndesigned to provide a\nrange of reasonable\nestimates, both better\nand worse than current\nexpectations.\nScenarios are weighted\nbased on the Company\u2019s\nexpectation of\neconomic\n\nconditions for the\nforeseeable future and\nreflect significant\njudgment and\nconsideration of\neconomic forecast\nuncertainty. Final\nloss estimates also\nconsider factors\naffecting credit\nlosses not reflected\nin the scenarios, due\nto the unique aspects\nof current conditions\nand expectations.\nThese factors may\ninclude, but are not\nlimited to, changes in\nborrower behavior or\nconditions in specific\nlending segments, loan\nservicing practices,\nregulatory guidance,\nand/or fiscal and\nmonetary policy\nactions.\n\nBecause business\nprocesses and credit\nrisks associated with\nunfunded credit\ncommitments are\nessentially the same\nas for loans, the\nCompany utilizes\nsimilar processes to\nestimate its liability\nfor unfunded credit\ncommitments, which is\nincluded in other\nliabilities in the\nConsolidated Balance\nSheet. Both the\nallowance for loan\nlosses and the\nliability for unfunded\ncredit commitments are\nincluded in the\nCompany\u2019s analysis of\ncredit losses and\nreported reserve\nratios.\n\nThe allowance recorded\nfor credit losses\nutilizes forward-\nlooking expected loss\nmodels to consider a\nvariety of factors\naffecting lifetime\ncredit losses. These\nfactors include, but\nare not limited to,\nmacroeconomic\nvariables such as\nunemployment rates,\nreal estate prices,\ngross domestic product\nlevels, interest\nrates, and corporate\nbond spreads, as well\nas loan and borrower\ncharacteristics, such\nas internal risk\nratings on commercial\nloans and consumer\ncredit scores,\ndelinquency status,\ncollateral type and\navailable valuation\ninformation,\nconsideration of end-\nof-term losses on\nlease residuals, and\nthe remaining term of\nthe loan, adjusted for\nexpected prepayments.\nFor each loan\nportfolio, including\nthose loans modified\nunder various loan\nmodification programs,\nmodel estimates are\nadjusted as necessary\nto consider any\nrelevant changes in\nportfolio composition,\nlending policies,\nunderwriting\nstandards, risk\nmanagement\n                      \n  U.S. Bancorp    15  \n                      \npractices, economic\nconditions or other\nfactors that may\naffect the accuracy of\nthe model. Expected\ncredit loss estimates\nalso include\nconsideration of\nexpected cash\nrecoveries on loans\npreviously charged-off\nor expected recoveries\non collateral-\ndependent loans where\nrecovery is expected\nthrough sale of the\ncollateral at fair\nvalue less selling\ncosts.\n\nFor loans and leases\nthat do not share\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics with a\npool of loans, the\nCompany establishes\nindividually assessed\nreserves. Reserves for\nindividual commercial\nnonperforming loans\ngreater than $5\nmillion in the\ncommercial lending\nsegment are analyzed\nutilizing expected\ncash flows discounted\nusing the original\neffective interest\nrate, the observable\nmarket price of the\nloan, or the fair\nvalue of the\ncollateral, less\nselling costs, for\ncollateral-dependent\nloans as appropriate.\n\nWhen evaluating the\nappropriateness of the\nallowance for credit\nlosses for any loans\nand lines in a junior\nlien position, the\nCompany considers the\ndelinquency and\nmodification status of\nthe first lien, based\non either servicing\ndata for the first\nlien accounts serviced\nby the Company or the\nstatus of first lien\nmortgage accounts\nreported on customer\ncredit bureau files\nwhen the first lien is\nnot serviced by the\nCompany. This\ninformation is\nconsidered within the\noverall assessment of\neconomic conditions,\nproblem loans, recent\nloss experience and\nother factors in\ndetermining the\nallowance for credit\nlosses.\n\nWhen a loan portfolio\nis purchased, the\nacquired loans are\ndivided into those\nconsidered purchased\nwith more than\ninsignificant credit\ndeterioration (\u201cPCD\u201d)\nand those not\nconsidered PCD. An\nallowance is\nestablished for each\npopulation and\nconsiders product mix,\nrisk characteristics\nof the portfolio and\ndelinquency status and\nrefreshed LTV ratios\nwhen possible.\nConsiderations for PCD\nloans include whether\nthe loan has\nexperienced a charge-\noff, bankruptcy or\nsignificant\ndeterioration since\norigination. The\nallowance established\nfor purchased loans\nnot considered PCD is\nrecognized through\nprovision expense upon\nacquisition, whereas\nthe allowance\nestablished for loans\nconsidered PCD at\nacquisition is offset\nby an increase in the\nbasis of the acquired\nloans. Any subsequent\nincreases and\ndecreases in the\nallowance related to\npurchased loans,\nregardless of PCD\nstatus, are recognized\nthrough provision\nexpense, with charge-\noffs charged to the\nallowance. The Company\nhad a total net book\nbalance of $2.2\nbillion of PCD loans,\nprimarily related to\nthe MUB acquisition,\nincluded in its loan\nportfolio at March 31,\n2025.\n\nThe Company\u2019s\nmethodology for\ndetermining the\nappropriate allowance\nfor credit losses also\nconsiders the\nimprecision inherent\nin the methodologies\nused and allocated to\nthe various loan\nportfolios. As a\nresult, amounts\ndetermined under the\nmethodologies\ndescribed above are\nadjusted by management\nto consider the\npotential impact of\nother qualitative\nfactors not captured\nin quantitative model\nadjustments which\ninclude, but are not\nlimited to, the\nfollowing: model\nimprecision,\nimprecision in\neconomic scenario\nassumptions, and\nemerging risks related\nto either changes in\nthe economic\nenvironment that are\naffecting specific\nportfolios, or changes\nin portfolio\nconcentrations over\ntime that may affect\nmodel performance. The\nconsideration of these\nitems results in\nadjustments to\nallowance amounts\nincluded in\n\nthe Company\u2019s\nallowance for credit\nlosses for each loan\nportfolio.\n\nAlthough the Company\ndetermined the amount\nof each element of the\nallowance separately\nand considers this\nprocess to be an\nimportant credit\nmanagement tool, the\nentire allowance for\ncredit losses is\navailable for the\nentire loan portfolio.\nThe actual amount of\nlosses can vary\nsignificantly from the\nestimated amounts.\n\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses was $7.9\nbillion at March 31,\n2025 and December 31,\n2024. The $10 million\n(0.1 percent) decrease\nin the allowance for\ncredit losses at March\n31, 2025, compared\nwith December 31,\n2024, was primarily\ndriven by improved\ncredit quality and\nportfolio mix. The\nCompany continued to\nmonitor economic\nuncertainty related to\ninterest rates,\ninflationary\npressures, changing\ntariff policies, and\nother economic factors\nthat may affect the\nfinancial strength of\ncorporate and consumer\nborrowers. The Company\nalso continued to\nmonitor the commercial\nreal estate office\nportfolio and has\nmaintained an\nallowance to loan\ncoverage ratio of\napproximately 10.9\npercent at March 31,\n2025. In addition to\nthese broad economic\nfactors, the Company\nconsidered various\nfactors for\ndetermining its\nexpected loss\nestimates, including\ncustomer specific\ninformation impacting\nchanges in risk\nratings, projected\ndelinquencies and the\nimpact of economic\ndeterioration on\nselected borrowers\u2019\nliquidity and ability\nto repay.\n\nThe ratio of the\nallowance for credit\nlosses to period-end\nloans was 2.07 percent\nat March 31, 2025,\ncompared with 2.09\npercent at December\n31, 2024. The ratio of\nthe allowance for\ncredit losses to\nnonperforming loans\nwas 470 percent at\nMarch 31, 2025,\ncompared with 442\npercent at December\n31, 2024. The ratio of\nthe allowance for\ncredit losses to\nannualized loan net\ncharge-offs was 357\npercent at March 31,\n2025, compared with\n368 percent of full\nyear 2024 net charge-\noffs at December 31,\n2024.\n\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses related\nto commercial lending\nsegment loans\ndecreased $39 million\nduring the first three\nmonths of 2025,\nreflecting improved\ncredit quality and\nportfolio mix,\npartially offset by\ncommercial loan growth\nand increased economic\nuncertainty.\n\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses related\nto consumer lending\nsegment loans\nincreased $29 million\nduring the first three\nmonths of 2025, due to\nthe impacts of\neconomic uncertainty.\n\nEconomic conditions\nconsidered in\nestimating the\nallowance for credit\nlosses at March 31,\n2025 included changes\nin projected gross\ndomestic product and\nunemployment levels.\nThese factors were\nevaluated through a\ncombination of\nquantitative\ncalculations using\nmultiple economic\nscenarios and\nadditional qualitative\nassessments that\nconsidered the degree\nof economic\nuncertainty in the\ncurrent environment.\nThe projected\nunemployment rates for\n2025 considered in the\nestimate ranged from\n3.2 percent to 8.4\npercent.\n                      \n  16    U.S. Bancorp  \n                      \nThe following table summarizes the baseline\nforecast for key

The Company\nmanages its exposure\nto changes in interest\nrates through asset\nand liability\nmanagement activities\nwithin guidelines\nestablished by its\nAsset Liability\nManagement Committee\n(\u201cALCO\u201d) and approved\nby the Board of\nDirectors. The ALCO\nhas the responsibility\nfor approving and\noverseeing compliance\nwith the ALCO\nmanagement policies,\nincluding interest\nrate risk exposure.\nOne way the Company\nmeasures and analyzes\nits interest rate risk\nis through analysis of\nnet interest income\nsensitivities across a\nrange of scenarios.\n\nNet interest income\nsensitivity analysis\nincludes evaluating\nall of the Company\u2019s\nassets and liabilities\nand off-balance sheet\ninstruments, inclusive\nof new business\nactivity, under\nvarious interest rate\nscenarios that differ\nin the direction,\namount and speed of\nchange over time, as\nwell as the overall\nshape of the yield\ncurve. The balance\nsheet includes\nassumptions regarding\nloan and deposit\nvolumes and pricing\nwhich are based on\nquantitative analysis,\nhistorical trends and\nmanagement outlook and\nstrategies. Deposit\nbalances, mix and\npricing are dynamic\nacross interest rate\nscenarios and will\nchange both with the\nabsolute level of\nrates as well as the\nassumed interest rate\nshock. Deposit pricing\nchanges, commonly\nreferred to as the\ndeposit beta,\nrepresents the amount\nby which the Company\u2019s\ninterest-bearing\ndeposit rates have or\nwill change given a\nchange in short-term\nmarket rates. Base\ncase and net interest\nincome sensitivities\nare reviewed monthly\nby the ALCO and are\nused to guide\nasset/liability\nmanagement strategies.\n\nThe Company also\nmanages interest rate\nsensitivity by\nutilizing market value\nof equity modeling,\nwhich measures the\ndegree to which the\nmarket values of the\nCompany\u2019s assets and\nliabilities and off-\nbalance sheet\ninstruments will\nchange given a change\nin interest rates.\nManagement measures\nthe impact of changes\nin market values due\nto interest rates\nunder a number of\nscenarios, including\nimmediate and\nsustained parallel\nshifts, and flattening\nor steepening of the\nyield curve. The\nCompany manages its\ninterest rate risk\nposition by holding\nassets with desired\ninterest rate risk\ncharacteristics on its\nbalance sheet,\nexecuting certain\npricing strategies for\nloans and deposits and\ndeploying investment\nportfolio, funding and\nderivative strategies.\n                                              \n  TABLE\u20099    Sensitivity of Net Interest      \n             Income                           \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                      \n  U.S. Bancorp    19  \n                      \nTable 9 summarizes the\nprojected impact to\nnet interest income\nover the next 12\nmonths of various\npotential interest\nrate changes. The\nsensitivity of the\nprojected impact to\nnet interest income\nover the next 12\nmonths is dependent on\nbalance sheet growth,\nproduct mix, customer\nbehavior, deposit\npricing and funding\ndecisions. From\nDecember 31, 2024 to\nMarch 31, 2025,\ninterest rate\nsensitivity to higher\nand lower rates was\nlargely unchanged. As\nof March 31, 2025, the\nCompany continues to\nbe asset sensitive to\na parallel upward move\nin interest rates with\nmost of that impact\ncoming from the long\nend of the yield\ncurve. Net interest\nincome simulation\nincorporates rate-\nsensitive deposit\nbehavior that could\nresult in changes in\nboth projected deposit\nbalances and mix under\nthe various interest\nrate scenarios. Higher\nrate scenarios result\nin disintermediation\nof bank deposits and a\nmix shift into higher\nyielding deposits.\nConversely, in lower\nrate scenarios, the\nanalysis assumes that\ndeposits will shift\ninto lower yielding\nproducts. While the\nCompany utilizes\nmodels and assumptions\nbased on historical\ninformation and\nexpected behaviors,\nactual outcomes could\nvary significantly.\nFor larger interest\nrate shock scenarios,\nmortgage assets and\ndeposits are expected\nto behave in a non-\nlinear manner\nresulting in varying\nimpacts to net\ninterest income in\nthose scenarios.\n\nUse of Derivatives to\nManage Interest Rate\nand Other Risks To\nmanage the sensitivity\nof earnings and\ncapital to interest\nrate, prepayment,\ncredit, price and\nforeign currency\nfluctuations (asset\nand liability\nmanagement positions),\nthe Company enters\ninto derivative\ntransactions. The\nCompany uses\nderivatives for asset\nand liability\nmanagement purposes\nprimarily in the\nfollowing ways:\n\n\u2022 To convert fixed-\nrate debt and\navailable-for-sale\ninvestment securities\nfrom fixed-rate\npayments to floating-\nrate payments;\n\n\u2022 To convert floating-\nrate loans and debt\nfrom floating-rate\npayments to fixed-rate\npayments;\n\n\u2022 To mitigate changes\nin value of the\nCompany\u2019s unfunded\nmortgage loan\ncommitments, funded\nMLHFS and MSRs;\n\n\u2022 To mitigate\nremeasurement\nvolatility of foreign\ncurrency denominated\nbalances; and\n\n\u2022 To mitigate the\nvolatility of the\nCompany\u2019s net\ninvestment in foreign\noperations driven by\nfluctuations in\nforeign currency\nexchange rates.\n\nIn addition, the\nCompany enters into\ninterest rate, foreign\nexchange and commodity\nderivative contracts\nto support the\nbusiness requirements\nof its customers\n(customer-related\npositions). The\nCompany minimizes the\nmarket, funding and\nliquidity risks of\ncustomer-related\npositions by either\nentering into similar\noffsetting positions\nwith broker-dealers,\nor on a portfolio\nbasis by entering into\nother derivative or\nnon-derivative\nfinancial instruments\nthat partially or\nfully offset the\nexposure from these\ncustomer-related\npositions. The Company\nmay enter into\nderivative contracts\nthat are either\nexchange-traded,\ncentrally cleared\nthrough clearinghouses\nor over-the-counter.\nThe Company does not\nutilize derivatives\nfor speculative\npurposes.\n\nThe Company does not\ndesignate all of the\nderivatives that it\nenters into for risk\nmanagement purposes as\naccounting hedges\nbecause of the\ninefficiency of\napplying the\nassociated accounting\nrequirements and may\ninstead elect fair\nvalue\n\naccounting for the\nrelated hedged items.\nIn particular, the\nCompany enters into\ninterest rate swaps,\nswaptions, forward\ncommitments to buy to-\nbe-announced\nsecurities (\u201cTBAs\u201d),\nU.S. Treasury and\nSecured Overnight\nFinancing Rate\n(\u201cSOFR\u201d) futures and\noptions on U.S.\nTreasury futures to\nmitigate fluctuations\nin the value of its\nMSRs, but does not\ndesignate those\nderivatives as\naccounting hedges.\nRefer to Note 6 of the\nNotes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements\nfor additional\ninformation regarding\nMSRs, including\nmanagement of the\nchanges in fair value.\n\nAdditionally, the\nCompany uses forward\ncommitments to sell\nTBAs and other\ncommitments to sell\nresidential mortgage\nloans at specified\nprices to economically\nhedge the interest\nrate risk in its\nresidential mortgage\nloan production\nactivities. The\nforward commitments to\nsell and the unfunded\nmortgage loan\ncommitments on loans\nintended to be sold\nare considered\nderivatives under the\naccounting guidance\nrelated to accounting\nfor derivative\ninstruments and\nhedging activities.\nThe Company has\nelected the fair value\noption for the MLHFS.\n\nDerivatives are\nsubject to credit risk\nassociated with\ncounterparties to the\ncontracts. Credit risk\nassociated with\nderivatives is\nmeasured by the\nCompany based on the\nprobability of\ncounterparty default.\nThe Company manages\nthe credit risk of its\nderivative positions\nby diversifying its\npositions among\nvarious\ncounterparties, by\nentering into master\nnetting arrangements,\nand, where possible,\nby requiring\ncollateral\narrangements. The\nCompany may also\ntransfer counterparty\ncredit risk related to\ninterest rate swaps to\nthird parties through\nthe use of risk\nparticipation\nagreements. In\naddition, certain\ninterest rate swaps,\ninterest rate forwards\nand credit contracts\nare required to be\ncentrally cleared\nthrough clearinghouses\nto further mitigate\ncounterparty credit\nrisk. The Company also\nmitigates the credit\nrisk of its derivative\npositions, as well as\nthe credit risk on\nloans or lending\nportfolios, through\nthe use of credit\ncontracts.\n\nFor additional\ninformation on\nderivatives and\nhedging activities,\nrefer to Notes 12 and\n13 in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nMarket Risk Management\nIn addition to\ninterest rate risk,\nthe Company is exposed\nto other forms of\nmarket risk,\nprincipally related to\ntrading activities\nwhich support\ncustomers\u2019 strategies\nto manage their own\nforeign currency,\ninterest rate risk,\ncommodities risk and\nfunding activities.\nFor purposes of its\ninternal capital\nadequacy assessment\nprocess, the Company\nconsiders risk arising\nfrom its trading\nactivities, as well as\nthe remeasurement\nvolatility of foreign\ncurrency denominated\nbalances included on\nits Consolidated\nBalance Sheet\n(collectively,\n\u201cCovered Positions\u201d),\nemploying\nmethodologies\nconsistent with the\nrequirements of\nregulatory rules for\nmarket risk. The\nCompany\u2019s Market Risk\nCommittee (\u201cMRC\u201d),\nwithin the framework\nof the ALCO, oversees\nmarket risk\nmanagement. The MRC\nmonitors and reviews\nthe Company\u2019s Covered\nPositions and\nestablishes policies\nfor market risk\nmanagement, including\nexposure limits for\neach portfolio. The\nCompany uses a VaR\napproach to measure\ngeneral market risk.\nTheoretically, VaR\nrepresents the\nstatistical risk of\nloss the Company has\nto adverse market\nmovements over a one-\nday time horizon. The\nCompany uses the\nHistorical Simulation\nmethod to calculate\nVaR for its Covered\nPositions measured at\nthe ninety-ninth\npercentile using a\none-year look-back\nperiod for\ndistributions derived\n                      \n  20    U.S. Bancorp  \n                      \nfrom past market data.\nThe market factors\nused in the\ncalculations include\nthose pertinent to\nmarket risks inherent\nin the underlying\ntrading portfolios,\nprincipally those that\naffect the Company\u2019s\ncorporate bond trading\nbusiness, foreign\ncurrency transaction\nbusiness, client\nderivatives business,\nloan trading business\nand municipal\nsecurities business,\nas well as those\ninherent in the\nCompany\u2019s foreign\ndenominated balances\nand the derivatives\nused to mitigate the\nrelated measurement\nvolatility. On\naverage, the Company\nexpects the one-day\nVaR to be exceeded by\nactual losses two to\nthree times per year\nrelated to these\npositions. The Company\nmonitors the accuracy\nof internal VaR models\nand modeling processes\nby back-testing model\nperformance, regularly\nupdating the\nhistorical data used\nby the VaR models and\nregular model\nvalidations to assess\nthe accuracy of the\nmodels\u2019 input,\nprocessing, and\nreporting components.\nAll models are\nrequired to be\nindependently reviewed\nand approved prior to\nbeing placed in use.\nIf the Company were to\nexperience market\nlosses in excess of\nthe estimated VaR more\noften than expected,\nthe VaR models and\nassociated assumptions\nwould be analyzed and\nadjusted. The average,\nhigh, low and period-\nend one-day VaR\namounts for the\nCompany\u2019s Covered\nPositions were as\nfollows:\n                                              \n  Three Months                                \n  Ended March 31                              \n  (Dollars in                                 \n  Millions)                 2025        2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Average             $  2        $  3        \n  High                   3           4        \n  Low                    2           2        \n  Period-end             3           3        \n                                              \nThe Company did not\nexperience any actual\nlosses for its\ncombined Covered\nPositions that\nexceeded VaR during\nthe three months ended\nMarch 31, 2025 and\n2024.

The\nCompany engages in\nvarious activities to\nmanage its liquidity\nrisk. These activities\ninclude diversifying\nits funding sources,\nstress testing, and\nholding readily-\nmarketable assets\nwhich can be used as a\nsource of liquidity if\nneeded. In addition,\nthe Company\u2019s\nprofitable operations,\nsound credit quality\nand strong credit\nratings and capital\nposition have enabled\nit to develop a large\nand reliable base of\ncore deposit funding\nwithin its market\nareas and in domestic\nand global capital\nmarkets.

The\nRisk Management\nCommittee of the\nCompany\u2019s Board of\nDirectors oversees the\nCompany\u2019s liquidity\nrisk management\nprocess and approves a\ncontingency funding\nplan. The ALCO reviews\nthe Company\u2019s\nliquidity policy and\nlimits, and regularly\nassesses the Company\u2019s\nability to meet\nfunding requirements\narising from adverse\ncompany-specific or\nmarket events. The\nCompany regularly\nprojects its funding\nneeds under various\nstress scenarios and\nmaintains a\ncontingency funding\nplan consistent with\nthe Company\u2019s access\nto diversified sources\nof contingent funding.\nThe Company maintains\na substantial level of\ntotal available\nliquidity in the form\nof on-balance sheet\nand off-balance sheet\nfunding sources. These\nliquidity sources\ninclude cash at the\nFederal Reserve Bank\nand certain European\ncentral banks,\nunencumbered liquid\nassets, and capacity\nto borrow from the\nFHLB and at the\n                      \n  U.S. Bancorp    21  \n                      \nFederal Reserve Bank\u2019s\nDiscount Window.\nUnencumbered liquid\nassets in the\nCompany\u2019s investment\nsecurities portfolio\nprovide asset\nliquidity through the\nCompany\u2019s ability to\nsell the securities or\npledge and borrow\nagainst them.

Total deposits were $512.5 billion at\nMarch 31, 2025, compared with $518.3 billion\nat December 31, 2024. Average noninterest-\nbearing deposit balances for the first quarter\nof 2025 decreased 6.0 percent compared with\nthe first quarter of 2024, reflecting the\nshift of noninterest-bearing balances into\ninterest-bearing deposit products resulting\nfrom the higher interest rate environment.\nAverage total deposits for the first quarter\nof 2025 and first quarter of 2024 funded\napproximately 76 percent and 77 percent of the\nCompany\u2019s total assets for these same periods,\nrespectively. Refer to \u201cBalance Sheet\nAnalysis\u201d for further information on the\nCompany\u2019s deposits. Additional funding is\nprovided by long-term debt and short-term\nborrowings. Long-term debt was $59.9 billion\nat March 31, 2025, and is an important funding\nsource because of its multi-year borrowing\nstructure. Short-term borrowings were $17.2\nbillion at March 31, 2025, and supplement the\nCompany\u2019s other funding sources. Refer to\n\u201cBalance Sheet Analysis\u201d for further\ninformation on the Company\u2019s long-term debt\nand short-term borrowings. In addition to\nassessing liquidity risk on a consolidated\nbasis, the Company monitors the parent\ncompany\u2019s liquidity. The parent company\u2019s\nroutine funding requirements consist primarily\nof operating expenses, dividends paid to\nshareholders, debt service, repurchases of\ncommon stock and funds used for acquisitions.\nThe parent company obtains funding to meet its\nobligations from dividends collected from its\nsubsidiaries and the issuance of debt and\ncapital securities. The Company establishes\nlimits for the minimal number of months into\nthe future where the parent company can meet\nexisting and forecasted obligations with cash\nand securities held that can be readily\nmonetized. The Company measures and manages\nthis limit in both normal and adverse\nconditions. The Company maintains sufficient\nfunding to meet expected capital and debt\nservice obligations for 24 months\n\nwithout the support of dividends from\nsubsidiaries and assuming access to the\nwholesale markets is maintained. The Company\nmaintains sufficient liquidity to meet its\ncapital and debt service obligations for 12\nmonths under adverse conditions without the\nsupport of dividends from subsidiaries or\naccess to the wholesale markets. The parent\ncompany is currently in excess of required\nliquidity minimums. At March 31, 2025, parent\ncompany long-term debt outstanding was $38.4\nbillion, compared with $35.3 billion at\nDecember 31, 2024. The increase was primarily\ndue to $3.0 billion of medium-term note\nissuances. As of March 31, 2025, there was\n$2.3 billion of parent company debt scheduled\nto mature in the remainder of 2025. Future\ndebt maturities may be met through medium-term\nnote and capital security issuances and\ndividends from subsidiaries, as well as from\nparent company cash and cash equivalents. The\nCompany is subject to a regulatory Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d) requirement which\nrequires large banking organizations to\nmaintain an adequate level of unencumbered\nhigh quality liquid assets to meet estimated\nliquidity needs over a 30-day stressed period.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024, the Company\u2019s average daily\nLCR was 108.3 percent and 106.6 percent,\nrespectively. The Company was compliant with\nthis requirement for both of these periods.\nThe Company is also subject to a regulatory\nNet Stable Funding Ratio requirement which\nrequires large banking organizations to\nmaintain a minimum level of stable funding\nbased on the liquidity characteristics of\ntheir assets, commitments, and derivative\nexposures over a one-year time horizon. The\nCompany was compliant with this requirement at\nMarch 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. Refer to\n\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \u2014\nLiquidity Risk Management\u201d in the Company\u2019s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024, for further discussion on\nliquidity risk management. European Exposures\nThe Company provides merchant processing and\ncorporate trust services in Europe either\ndirectly or through banking affiliations in\nEurope. Revenue generated from sources in\nEurope represented approximately 2 percent of\nthe Company\u2019s total net revenue for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2025. Operating cash\nfor these businesses is deposited on a short-\nterm basis typically with certain European\ncentral banks. For deposits placed at other\nEuropean banks, exposure is mitigated by the\nCompany placing deposits at multiple banks and\nmanaging the amounts on deposit at any bank\nbased on institution-specific deposit limits.\nAt March 31, 2025, the Company had an\naggregate amount on deposit with European\nbanks of approximately $7.2 billion,\npredominately with the Central Bank of Ireland\nand Bank of England. In addition, the Company\nprovides financing to domestic multinational\ncorporations that generate revenue from\ncustomers in European countries, transacts\nwith various European banks as counterparties\nto certain derivative-related activities, and\nthrough a subsidiary, manages money market\nfunds that hold certain investments in\nEuropean sovereign debt. Any deterioration in\neconomic conditions in Europe, including the\nimpacts resulting from the Russia-Ukraine\nconflict, is not expected to have a\nsignificant effect on the Company related to\nthese activities.\n                      \n  22    U.S. Bancorp  \n                      \nCommitments,\nContingent Liabilities\nand Other Contractual\nObligations The\nCompany participates\nin many different\ncontractual\narrangements which may\nor may not be recorded\non its balance sheet,\nwith unrelated or\nconsolidated entities,\nunder which the\nCompany has an\nobligation to pay\ncertain amounts,\nprovide credit or\nliquidity enhancements\nor provide market risk\nsupport. These\narrangements include\ncommitments to extend\ncredit, letters of\ncredit and various\nforms of guarantees.\nRefer to Note 15 of\nthe Notes to\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements for further\ninformation on\nguarantees and\ncontingent\nliabilities. These\narrangements also\ninclude any obligation\nrelated to a variable\ninterest held in an\nunconsolidated entity\nthat provides\nfinancing, liquidity,\ncredit enhancement or\nmarket risk support.\nRefer to Note 5 of the\nNotes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements\nfor further\ninformation related to\nthe Company\u2019s\ninterests in variable\ninterest entities\n(\u201cVIEs\u201d).\n\nCapital Management The\nCompany is committed\nto managing capital to\nmaintain strong\nprotection for\ndepositors and\ncreditors and for\nmaximum shareholder\nbenefit. The Company\nalso manages its\ncapital to exceed\nregulatory capital\nrequirements for\nbanking organizations.\nTo achieve its capital\ngoals, the Company\nemploys a variety of\ncapital management\ntools, including\ndividends, common\nshare repurchases, and\nthe issuance of\nsubordinated debt,\nnon-cumulative\nperpetual preferred\nstock, common stock\nand other capital\ninstruments. The\nregulatory capital\nrequirements effective\nfor the Company follow\nBasel III, with the\nCompany being subject\nto calculating its\ncapital adequacy as a\npercentage of risk-\nweighted assets under\nthe standardized\napproach. Beginning in\n2022, the Company\nbegan to phase into\nits regulatory capital\nrequirements the\ncumulative deferred\nimpact of its 2020\nadoption of the\naccounting guidance\n\nrelated to the\nimpairment of\nfinancial instruments\nbased on the current\nexpected credit losses\n(\u201cCECL\u201d) methodology\nplus 25 percent of its\nquarterly credit\nreserve increases\nduring 2020 and 2021.\nThis cumulative\ndeferred impact was\nphased into the\nCompany\u2019s regulatory\ncapital during 2022\nthrough 2024.\nBeginning January 1,\n2025, the regulatory\ncapital requirements\nreflect the full\nimplementation of the\nCECL methodology.\nTable 10 provides a\nsummary of statutory\nregulatory capital\nratios in effect for\nthe Company at March\n31, 2025 and December\n31, 2024. All\nregulatory ratios\nexceeded regulatory\n\u201cwell-capitalized\u201d\nrequirements.\n\nIn July 2023, the U.S.\nfederal bank\nregulatory authorities\nproposed a rule to\nrefine the Basel III\ncapital framework for\nfinancial\ninstitutions. The\nproposal incorporates\nelements of the\ninternational Basel\nCommittee\u2019s post-\ncrisis reforms,\nincluding the\nFundamental Review of\nthe Trading Book to\nreplace the existing\nmarket risk rule, and\nintroduces new\nstandardized\napproaches for credit\nrisk, operational risk\nand credit valuation\nadjustment (CVA) risk.\nThe proposal\u2019s\nfinalization could\nrevise the risk-based\ncapital measures\napplicable to the\nCompany; however,\nuntil the proposal is\nfinalized the exact\nimpacts are unknown.\n\nThe Company believes\ncertain other capital\nratios are useful in\nevaluating its capital\nadequacy. The\nCompany\u2019s tangible\ncommon equity, as a\npercent of tangible\nassets and as a\npercent of risk-\nweighted assets\ndetermined in\naccordance with\nprescribed regulatory\ncapital requirements\nunder the standardized\napproach, was 6.0\npercent and 8.9\npercent, respectively,\nat March 31, 2025,\ncompared with 5.8\npercent and 8.5\npercent, respectively,\nat December 31, 2024.\nRefer to \u201cNon-GAAP\nFinancial Measures\u201d\nbeginning on page\n27for further\ninformation on these\nother capital ratios.\n                                         \n  TABLE\u200910

regulators,\nthe Company considers\nvarious other measures\nwhen evaluating\ncapital utilization\nand adequacy,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 Tangible common\nequity to tangible\nassets,\n\n\u2022 Tangible common\nequity to risk-\nweighted assets,\n\n\u2022 Common equity tier 1\ncapital to risk-\nweighted assets,\nreflecting the full\nimplementation of the\nCECL methodology, and\n\n\u2022 Return on tangible\ncommon equity.\n\nThese capital measures\nare viewed by\nmanagement as useful\nadditional methods of\nevaluating the\nCompany\u2019s utilization\nof its capital held\nand the level of\ncapital available to\nwithstand unexpected\nnegative market or\neconomic conditions.\nAdditionally,\npresentation of these\nmeasures allows\ninvestors, analysts\nand banking regulators\nto assess the\nCompany\u2019s capital\nposition and use of\ncapital relative to\nother financial\nservices companies.\nThese capital measures\nare not defined in\ngenerally accepted\naccounting principles\n(\u201cGAAP\u201d), or in\nbanking regulations or\nwere not effective for\ncertain periods. In\naddition, certain\ncapital measures\nrelated to prior\nperiods are presented\non the same basis as\nthose in the current\nperiod. The effective\ncapital ratios defined\nby banking\n\nregulations for these\nperiods were subject\nto certain\ntransitional\nprovisions for the\nimplementation of\naccounting guidance\nrelated to impairment\nof financial\ninstruments based on\nthe CECL methodology.\nAs a result, these\ncapital measures\ndisclosed by the\nCompany may be\nconsidered non-GAAP\nfinancial measures.\nManagement believes\nthis information helps\ninvestors assess\ntrends in the\nCompany\u2019s capital\nutilization and\nadequacy.\n\nThe Company also\ndiscloses net interest\nincome and related\nratios and analysis on\na taxable-equivalent\nbasis, which may also\nbe considered non-GAAP\nfinancial measures.\nThe Company believes\nthis presentation to\nbe the preferred\nindustry measurement\nof net interest income\nas it provides a\nrelevant comparison of\nnet interest income\narising from taxable\nand tax-exempt\nsources. In addition,\ncertain performance\nmeasures utilize net\ninterest income on a\ntaxable-equivalent\nbasis, including the\nefficiency ratio and\nnet interest margin.\n\nThere may be limits in\nthe usefulness of\nthese measures to\ninvestors. As a\nresult, the Company\nencourages readers to\nconsider the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements and other\nfinancial information\ncontained in this\nreport in their\nentirety, and not to\nrely on

 \n                                              \nThe accounting and\nreporting policies of\nthe Company comply\nwith accounting\nprinciples generally\naccepted in the United\nStates and conform to\ngeneral practices\nwithin the banking\nindustry. The\npreparation of\nfinancial statements\nin conformity with\nGAAP requires\nmanagement to make\nestimates and\nassumptions. The\nCompany\u2019s financial\nposition and results\nof operations can be\naffected by these\nestimates and\nassumptions, which are\nintegral to\nunderstanding the\nCompany\u2019s financial\nstatements. Critical\naccounting policies\nare those policies\nmanagement believes\nare the most important\nto the portrayal of\nthe Company\u2019s\nfinancial condition\nand results, and\nrequire management to\nmake estimates that\nare difficult,\nsubjective or complex.\nMost accounting\npolicies are not\nconsidered by\nmanagement to be\ncritical accounting\npolicies. Management\nhas discussed the\ndevelopment and the\nselection of critical\naccounting policies\nwith the Company\u2019s\nAudit Committee. Those\npolicies considered to\nbe critical accounting\npolicies relate to the\nallowance for credit\nlosses, fair value\nestimates, MSRs, and\nincome taxes. These\naccounting policies\nare discussed in\ndetail in\n\u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis \u2014 Critical\nAccounting Policies\u201d\nand the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in the\n\nCompany\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024.\n                                              \n   Controls and Procedures                    \n                                              \nUnder the supervision\nand with the\nparticipation of the\nCompany\u2019s management,\nincluding its\nprincipal executive\nofficer and principal\nfinancial officer, the\nCompany has evaluated\nthe effectiveness of\nthe design and\noperation of its\ndisclosure controls\nand procedures (as\ndefined in Rules\n13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e) under the\nSecurities Exchange\nAct of 1934, as\namended (the \u201cExchange\nAct\u201d)). Based upon\nthis evaluation, the\nprincipal executive\nofficer and principal\nfinancial officer have\nconcluded that, as of\nthe end of the period\ncovered by this\nreport, the Company\u2019s\ndisclosure controls\nand procedures were\neffective.\n\nDuring the first\nquarter of 2025, there\nwas no change made in\nthe Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting (as defined\nin Rules 13a-15(f) and\n15d-15(f) under the\nExchange Act) that has\nmaterially affected,\nor is reasonably\nlikely to materially\naffect, the Company\u2019s\ninternal control

If the Company\nintends to sell or it is more likely than not\nthe Company will be required to sell an\ninvestment security, the amortized cost of the\nsecurity is written down to fair value. When\nevaluating credit losses, the Company\nconsiders various factors such as the nature\nof the investment security, the credit ratings\nor financial condition of the issuer, the\nextent of the unrealized loss, expected cash\nflows of underlying collateral, the existence\nof any government or agency guarantees, and\nmarket conditions. The Company measures the\nallowance for credit losses using market\ninformation where available and discounting\nthe cash flows at the original effective rate\nof the investment security. The allowance for\ncredit losses is adjusted each period through\nearnings and can be subsequently recovered.\nThe allowance for credit losses on the\nCompany\u2019s available-for-sale investment\nsecurities was immaterial at March 31, 2025\nand December 31, 2024.\n\nAt March 31, 2025, certain investment\nsecurities had a fair value below amortized\ncost.

In general, the issuers of the\ninvestment securities are contractually\nprohibited from prepayment at less than par,\nand the Company did not pay significant\npurchase premiums for these investment\nsecurities. At March 31, 2025, the Company had\nno plans to sell investment securities with\nunrealized losses, and believes it is more\nlikely than not it would not be required to\nsell such investment securities before\nrecovery of their amortized cost.\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2025\nand 2024, the Company did not purchase any\ninvestment securities that had more-than-\ninsignificant credit deterioration.\n\nPredominately all of the Company\u2019s held-to-\nmaturity investment securities are U.S.\nTreasury and agencies securities and highly\nrated agency mortgage-backed securities that\nare guaranteed or otherwise supported by the\nUnited States government and have no history\nof credit losses.

All other\npurchased loans are considered non-purchased\ncredit deteriorated loans.\nAllowance for Credit Losses The allowance for\ncredit losses is established for current\nexpected credit losses on the Company\u2019s loan\nand lease portfolio, including unfunded credit\ncommitments. The allowance considers expected\nlosses for the remaining lives of the\napplicable assets, inclusive of expected\nrecoveries. The allowance for credit losses is\nincreased through provisions charged to\nearnings and reduced by net charge-offs.\nManagement evaluates the appropriateness of\nthe allowance for credit losses on a quarterly\nbasis.\nMultiple economic scenarios are considered\nover a three-yearreasonable and supportable\nforecast period, which includes increasing\nconsideration of historical loss experience\nover years two and three. These economic\nscenarios are constructed with interrelated\nprojections of multiple economic variables,\nand loss estimates are produced that consider\nthe historical correlation of those economic\nvariables with credit losses. After the\nforecast period, the Company fully reverts to\nlong-term historical loss experience, adjusted\nfor prepayments and characteristics of the\ncurrent loan and lease portfolio, to estimate\nlosses over the remaining life of the\nportfolio. The economic scenarios are updated\nat least quarterly and are designed to provide\na range of reasonable estimates, both better\nand worse than current expectations. Scenarios\nare weighted based on the Company\u2019s\nexpectation of economic conditions for the\nforeseeable future and reflect significant\njudgment and consideration of economic\nforecast uncertainty. Final loss estimates\nalso consider factors affecting credit losses\nnot reflected in the scenarios, due to the\nunique aspects of current conditions and\nexpectations. These factors may include, but\nare not limited to, loan servicing practices,\nregulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and\nmonetary policy actions.\nThe allowance recorded for credit losses\nutilizes forward-looking expected loss models\nto consider a variety of factors affecting\nlifetime credit losses. These factors include,\nbut are not limited to, macroeconomic\nvariables such as unemployment rates, real\n                      \n  38    U.S. Bancorp  \n                      \nestate prices, gross domestic product levels,\ninflation, interest rates and corporate bonds\nspreads, as well as loan and borrower\ncharacteristics, such as internal risk ratings\non commercial loans and consumer credit\nscores, delinquency status, collateral type\nand available valuation information,\nconsideration of end-of-term losses on lease\nresiduals, and the remaining term of the loan,\nadjusted for expected prepayments. For each\nloan portfolio, including those loans modified\nunder various loan modification programs,\nmodel estimates are adjusted as necessary to\nconsider any relevant changes in portfolio\ncomposition, lending policies, underwriting\nstandards, risk management practices, economic\nconditions or other factors that would affect\nthe accuracy of the model. Expected credit\nloss estimates also include consideration of\nexpected cash recoveries on loans previously\ncharged-off or expected recoveries on\ncollateral dependent loans where recovery is\nexpected through sale of the collateral at\nfair value less selling costs. Where loans do\nnot exhibit similar risk characteristics, an\nindividual analysis is performed to consider\nexpected credit losses. For loans and leases\nthat do not share similar risk characteristics\nwith a pool of loans, the Company establishes\nindividually assessed reserves. Reserves for\nindividual commercial nonperforming loans\ngreater than $ 5million in the commercial\nlending segment are analyzed utilizing\nexpected cash flows discounted using the\noriginal effective interest rate, the\nobservable market price of the loan, or the\nfair value of the collateral, less selling\ncosts, for collateral-dependent loans as\nappropriate. For smaller commercial loans\ncollectively evaluated for impairment,\nhistorical loss experience is also\nincorporated into the allowance methodology\napplied to this category of loans.\n\nThe Company\u2019s methodology for determining the\nappropriate allowance for credit losses also\nconsiders the imprecision inherent in the\nmethodologies used and allocated to the\nvarious loan portfolios. As a result, amounts\ndetermined under the methodologies described\nabove are adjusted by management to consider\nthe potential impact of other qualitative\nfactors not captured in the quantitative model\nadjustments which include, but are not limited\nto, the following: model imprecision,\nimprecision in economic scenario assumptions,\nand emerging risks related to either changes\nin the environment that are affecting specific\nportfolios, or changes in portfolio\nconcentrations over time that may affect model\nperformance. The consideration of these items\nresults in adjustments to allowance amounts\nincluded in the Company\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses for each loan portfolio.\n\nThe Company also assesses the credit risk\nassociated with off-balance sheet loan\ncommitments, letters of credit, investment\nsecurities and derivatives. Credit risk\nassociated with derivatives is reflected in\nthe fair values recorded for those positions.\nThe liability for off-balance sheet credit\nexposure related to loan commitments and other\ncredit guarantees is included in other\nliabilities. Because business processes and\ncredit risks associated with unfunded credit\ncommitments are essentially the same as for\nloans, the Company utilizes similar processes\nto estimate its liability for unfunded credit\ncommitments.\n\nThe results of the analysis are evaluated\nquarterly to confirm the estimates are\nappropriate for each specific loan portfolio,\nas well as the entire loan portfolio, as the\nentire allowance for credit losses is\navailable for the entire loan portfolio.\nActivity in the allowance for credit losses by\nportfolio class was as follows:\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n        \u2026    $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n        \u2026                                     \n                                              \n        \u2026                                     \n        \u2026                                     \n        \u2026                                     \n        \u2026    $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n        \u2026    $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n        \u2026                                     \n                                              \n        \u2026                                     \n        \u2026                                     \n        \u2026                                     \n        \u2026    $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \nThe decrease in the allowance for credit\nlosses at March 31, 2025, compared with\nDecember 31, 2024, was primarily driven by\nimproved credit quality and portfolio mix.\n                      \n  U.S. Bancorp    39  \n                      \nThe following table provides a summary of\nloans charged-off by portfolio class and year\nof origination:\n                                              \n                                    \u2026         \n                                    \u2026         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                   \u2014    $      $         \u2026    \n                   \u2014                     \u2026    \n                   \u2014                     \u2026    \n                   \u2014                     \u2026    \n                   \u2014                     \u2026    \n                   4                     \u2026    \n                   \u2014                     \u2026    \n                   4    $      $         \u2026    \n                                              \n                   \u2014    $      $         7    \n                   \u2014                     \u2026    \n                   \u2014                     \u2026    \n                   \u2014                     \u2026    \n                   \u2014                     \u2026    \n                   4                     \u2026    \n                   \u2014                     \u2026    \n                   4    $      $         \u2026    \n                                              \nNote: Year of origination is based on the\norigination date of a loan, or for existing\nloans the date when the maturity date, pricing\nor commitment amount is amended. Predominantly\nall current year and near term loan\norigination years for gross charge-offs relate\nto existing loans that have had recent\nmaturity date, pricing or commitment amount\namendments.\n(a) Predominantly all credit card loans are\nconsidered revolving loans. Includes an\nimmaterial amount of charge-offs related to\nrevolving converted to term loans.\nCredit Quality The credit quality of the\nCompany\u2019s loan portfolios is assessed as a\nfunction of net credit losses, levels of\nnonperforming assets and delinquencies, and\ncredit quality ratings as defined by the\nCompany.\n\nFor all loan portfolio classes, loans are\nconsidered past due based on the number of\ndays delinquent except for monthly amortizing\nloans which are classified delinquent based\nupon the number of contractually required\npayments not made (for example, two missed\npayments is considered 30 days delinquent).\nWhen a loan is placed on nonaccrual status,\nunpaid accrued interest is reversed, reducing\ninterest income in the current period.\n\nCommercial lending segment loans are generally\nplaced on nonaccrual status when the\ncollection of principal and interest has\nbecome 90days past due or is otherwise\nconsidered doubtful. Commercial lending\nsegment loans are generally fully charged down\nif unsecured by collateral or partially\ncharged down to the fair value of the\ncollateral securing the loan, less costs to\nsell, when the loan is placed on nonaccrual.\n\nConsumer lending segment loans are generally\ncharged-off at a specific number of days or\npayments past due. Residential mortgages and\nother retail loans secured by 1-4 family\nproperties are generally charged down to the\nfair value of the collateral securing the\nloan, less costs to sell, at 180days past due.\nResidential mortgage loans and lines in a\nfirst lien position are placed on nonaccrual\nstatus in instances where a partial charge-off\noccurs unless the loan is well secured and in\nthe process of collection. Residential\nmortgage loans and lines in a junior lien\nposition secured by 1-4 family properties are\nplaced on nonaccrual status at 120days past\ndue or when they are behind a first lien that\nhas become 180days or greater past due or\nplaced on nonaccrual status. Any secured\nconsumer lending segment loan whose borrower\nhas had debt discharged through bankruptcy,\nfor which the loan amount exceeds the fair\nvalue of the collateral, is charged down to\nthe fair value of the related collateral and\nthe remaining balance is placed on nonaccrual\nstatus. Credit card loans continue to accrue\ninterest until the account is charged-off.\nCredit cards are charged-off at 180days past\ndue. Other retail loans not secured by 1-4\nfamily properties are charged-off at 120days\npast due, and revolving consumer lines are\ncharged-off at 180days past due. Similar to\ncredit cards, other retail loans are generally\nnot placed on nonaccrual status because of the\nrelative short period of time to charge-off.\nCertain retail customers having financial\ndifficulties may have the terms of their\ncredit card and other loan agreements modified\nto require only principal payments and, as\nsuch, are reported as nonaccrual.\n\nFor all loan classes, interest payments\nreceived on nonaccrual loans are generally\nrecorded as a reduction to a loan\u2019s carrying\namount while a loan is on nonaccrual and are\nrecognized as interest income upon payoff of\nthe loan. However, interest income may be\nrecognized for interest payments if the\nremaining carrying amount of the loan is\nbelieved to be collectible. In certain\ncircumstances, loans in any class may be\nrestored to accrual status, such as when a\nloan has demonstrated sustained repayment\nperformance or no amounts are past due and\nprospects for future payment are no longer in\ndoubt; or when the loan becomes well secured\nand is in the process of collection. Loans\nwhere there has been a partial charge-off may\nbe returned to accrual status if all principal\nand interest (including amounts previously\ncharged-off) is expected to be collected and\nthe loan is current.\n                      \n  40    U.S. Bancorp  \n                      \nThe following table provides a summary of\nloans by portfolio class, including the\ndelinquency status of those that continue to\naccrue interest, and those that are\nnonperforming:\n                                              \n                          \u2026                   \n                          \u2026                   \n                  \u2026       \u2026                   \n                  \u2026       \u2026                   \n                  \u2026       \u2026                   \n         \u2026  \u2026     \u2026       \u2026       \u2026           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       5       \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026       \u2014      \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       9       \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026       \u2014      \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n(a) At March 31, 2025, $ 512million of loans\n30\u201389 days past due and $ 2.5billion of loans\n90 days or more past due purchased and that\ncould be purchased from GNMA mortgage pools\nunder delinquent loan repurchase options whose\nrepayments are insured by the Federal Housing\nAdministration or guaranteed by the United\nStates Department of Veterans Affairs, were\nclassified as current, compared with $\n660million and $ 2.3billion at December 31,\n2024, respectively.\n(b) Substantially all nonperforming loans at\nMarch 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, had an\nassociated allowance for credit losses.

Commercial and commercial real estate\nmodifications generally include extensions of\nthe maturity date and may be accompanied by an\nincrease or decrease to the interest rate. In\naddition, the Company may work with the\nborrower in identifying other changes that\nmitigate loss to the Company, which may\ninclude additional collateral or guarantees to\nsupport the loan. To a lesser extent, the\nCompany may provide an interest rate\nreduction.\n\nModifications for the consumer lending segment\nare generally part of programs the Company has\ninitiated. The Company modifies residential\nmortgage loans under Federal Housing\nAdministration, United States Department of\nVeterans Affairs, or its own internal\nprograms. Under these programs, the Company\noffers qualifying homeowners the opportunity\nto permanently modify their loan and achieve\nmore affordable monthly payments. These\nmodifications may include adjustments to\ninterest rates, conversion of adjustable rates\nto fixed rates, extension of maturity dates or\ndeferrals of payments, capitalization of\naccrued interest and/or outstanding advances,\nor in limited situations, partial forgiveness\nof loan principal. In some instances,\nparticipation in residential mortgage loan\nmodification programs requires the customer to\ncomplete a short-term trial period. A\npermanent loan modification is contingent on\nthe customer successfully completing the trial\nperiod arrangement, and the loan documents are\nnot modified until that time.\n\nCredit card and other retail loan\nmodifications are generally part of distinct\nmodification programs providing customers\nexperiencing financial difficulty with\nmodifications whereby balances may be\namortized up to 60months, and generally\ninclude waiver of fees and reduced interest\nrates.\n\nLoans that receive a forbearance plan\ngenerally remain in default until they are no\nlonger delinquent as the result of the payment\nof all past due amounts or the borrower\nreceiving a term extension or modification.\nTherefore, loans only receiving forbearance\nplans are not included in the table below.\nThe

The majority of the\nCompany\u2019s financial asset transfers are\nresidential mortgage loan sales primarily to\nGSEs, transfers of tax-advantaged investments,\ncommercial loan sales through participation\nagreements, and other individual or portfolio\nloan and securities sales. In accordance with\nthe accounting guidance for asset transfers,\nthe Company considers any ongoing involvement\nwith transferred assets in determining whether\nthe assets can be derecognized from the\nbalance sheet.Guarantees provided to certain\nthird parties in connection with the transfer\nof assets are further discussed in Note 15.\nFor loans sold under participation agreements,\nthe Company also considers whether the terms\nof the loan participation agreement meet the\naccounting definition of a participating\ninterest. With the exception of servicing and\ncertain performance-based guarantees, the\nCompany\u2019s continuing involvement with\nfinancial assets sold is minimal and generally\nlimited to market customary representation and\nwarranty clauses. Any gain or loss on sale\ndepends on the previous carrying amount of the\ntransferred financial assets, the\nconsideration received, and any liabilities\nincurred in exchange for the transferred\nassets. Upon transfer, any servicing assets\nand other interests that continue to be held\nby the Company are initially recognized at\nfair value.For further information on MSRs,\nrefer to Note 6. On a limited basis, the\nCompany may acquire and package high-grade\ncorporate bonds for select corporate\ncustomers, in which the Company generally has\nno continuing involvement with these\ntransactions. Additionally, the Company is an\nauthorized GNMA issuer and issues GNMA\nsecurities on a regular basis. The Company has\nno other asset securitizations or similar\nasset-backed financing arrangements that are\noff-balance sheet.\nThe Company is involved in various entities\nthat are considered to be VIEs. The Company\u2019s\ninvestments in VIEs are primarily related to\ninvestments promoting affordable housing,\ncommunity development and renewable energy\nsources. Some of these tax-advantaged\ninvestments support the Company\u2019s regulatory\ncompliance with the Community Reinvestment\nAct. The Company\u2019s investments in these\nentities generate a return primarily through\nthe realization of federal and state income\ntax credits, and other tax benefits, such as\ntax deductions from operating losses of the\ninvestments, over specified time periods.\nThese tax credits are recognized as a\nreduction of tax expense or, for investments\nqualifying as investment tax credits, as a\nreduction to the related investment asset. The\nCompany recognized federal and state income\ntax credits related to its affordable housing\nand other tax-advantaged investments in tax\nexpense of $ 152million and $ 139million for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2025 and\n2024,\n                      \n  U.S. Bancorp    45  \n                      \nrespectively. The Company recognized $\n146million and $ 138million of expenses\nrelated to all of these investments for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024,\nrespectively, which were primarily included in\ntax expense.\nThe Company is not required to consolidate\nVIEs in which it has concluded it does not\nhave a controlling financial interest, and\nthus is not the primary beneficiary. In such\ncases, the Company does not have both the\npower to direct the entities\u2019 most significant\nactivities and the obligation to absorb losses\nor the right to receive benefits that could\npotentially be significant to the VIEs.\nThe Company\u2019s investments in these\nunconsolidated VIEs are carried in other\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The\nCompany\u2019s unfunded capital and other\ncommitments related to these unconsolidated\nVIEs are generally carried in other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe Company\u2019s maximum exposure to loss from\nthese unconsolidated VIEs include the\ninvestment recorded on the Company\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, net of unfunded\ncapital commitments, and previously recorded\ntax credits which remain subject to recapture\nby taxing authorities based on compliance\nfeatures required to be met at the project\nlevel. While the Company believes potential\nlosses from these investments are remote, the\nmaximum exposure was determined by assuming a\nscenario where the community-based business\nand housing projects completely fail and do\nnot meet certain government compliance\nrequirements resulting in recapture of the\nrelated tax credits.\nThe following table provides a summary of\ninvestments in community development and tax-\nadvantaged VIEs that the Company has not\nconsolidated:\n                                              \n  (Dol\u2026              March             Dece\u2026  \n  in                 31,               31,    \n  Mill\u2026              2025              2024   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Inve\u2026                                       \n  carr\u2026    $  8,703          $  8,107         \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  Unfu\u2026                                       \n  capi\u2026                                       \n  and         5,751             5,032         \n  other                                       \n  comm\u2026                                       \n  Maxi\u2026                                       \n  expo\u2026       8,522             8,435         \n  to                                          \n  loss                                        \n                                              \nThe Company also has noncontrolling financial\ninvestments in private investment funds and\npartnerships considered to be VIEs, which are\nnot consolidated. The Company\u2019s recorded\ninvestment in these entities, carried in other\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, was\napproximately $ 273million at March 31, 2025\nand $ 264million at December 31, 2024. The\nmaximum exposure to loss related to these VIEs\nwas $ 398million at March 31, 2025 and $\n382million at December 31, 2024, representing\nthe Company\u2019s investment balance and its\nunfunded commitments to invest additional\namounts.\n\nThe Company also held senior notes of $\n2.7billion as available-for-sale investment\nsecurities at March 31, 2025, compared with $\n3.2billion at December 31, 2024. These senior\nnotes were issued by third-party\nsecuritization vehicles that held $ 3.1billion\nat March 31, 2025 and $ 3.6billion at December\n31, 2024 of indirect auto loans that\ncollateralize the senior notes. These VIEs are\nnot consolidated by the Company.\n\nThe Company\u2019s individual net investments in\nunconsolidated VIEs, which exclude any\nunfunded capital commitments, ranged from less\nthan $ 1million to $ 80million at March 31,\n2025, compared with less than $ 1million to $\n79million at December 31, 2024.\n\nThe Company is required to consolidate VIEs in\nwhich it has concluded it has a controlling\nfinancial interest.The Company sponsors\nentities to which it transfers its interests\nin tax-advantaged investments to third\nparties. At March 31, 2025, approximately $\n5.8billion of the Company\u2019s assets and $\n3.5billion of its liabilities included on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet were related to\ncommunity development and tax-advantaged\ninvestment VIEs which the Company has\nconsolidated, primarily related to these\ntransfers. These amounts compared to $\n6.4billion and $ 4.2billion, respectively, at\nDecember 31, 2024. The majority of the assets\nof these consolidated VIEs are reported in\nother assets, and the liabilities are reported\nin long-term debt and other liabilities. The\nassets of a particular VIE are the primary\nsource of funds to settle its obligations. The\ncreditors of the VIEs do not have recourse to\nthe general credit of the Company. The\nCompany\u2019s exposure to the consolidated VIEs is\ngenerally limited to the carrying value of its\nvariable interests plus any related tax\ncredits previously recognized or transferred\nto others with a guarantee.\n                      \n  46    U.S. Bancorp  \n                      \n                                       \n  NOTE\u20096    Mortgage Servicing Rights  \n                                       \nThe Company capitalizes MSRs as separate\nassets when loans are sold and servicing is\nretained. MSRs may also be purchased from\nothers. The Company carries MSRs at fair\nvalue, with changes in the fair value recorded\nin earnings during the period in which they\noccur.

Included in mortgage\nbanking revenue are the MSR fair value changes\narising from market rate and model assumption\nchanges, net of the value change in\nderivatives used to economically hedge MSRs.\nThese changes resulted in net gains of $\n2million and net losses of $ 3million for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024,\nrespectively.

On\nan ongoing basis, numerous federal, state,\nlocal and foreign examinations are in progress\nand cover multiple tax years. As of March 31,\n2025, federal tax examinations for all years\nending through December 31, 2020 are completed\nand resolved. The Company\u2019s tax returns for\nthe years ended December 31, 2021 through\nDecember 31, 2022 are under examination by the\nInternal Revenue Service. The years open to\nexamination by foreign, state and local\ngovernment authorities vary by jurisdiction.\n\nThe Company\u2019s net deferred tax asset was $\n5.7billion at March 31, 2025 and $ 6.3billion\nat December 31, 2024.\n                                     \n  NOTE 12    Derivative Instruments  \n                                     \nIn the ordinary course of business, the\nCompany enters into derivative transactions to\nmanage various risks and to accommodate the\nbusiness requirements of its customers. The\nCompany recognizes all derivatives on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet at fair value in\nother assets or in other liabilities. On the\ndate the Company enters into a derivative\ncontract, the derivative is designated as\neither a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge,\nnet investment hedge, or a designation is not\nmade as it is a customer-related transaction,\nan economic hedge for asset/liability risk\nmanagement purposes or another stand-alone\nderivative created through the Company\u2019s\noperations (\u201cfree-standing derivative\u201d). When\na derivative is designated as a fair value,\ncash flow or net investment hedge, the Company\nperforms an assessment, at inception and, at a\nminimum, quarterly thereafter, to determine\nthe effectiveness of the derivative in\noffsetting changes in the value or cash flows\nof the hedged item(s).\nFair Value Hedges These derivatives are\ninterest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge\nthe change in fair value related to interest\nrate changes of its underlying available-for-\nsale investment securities and fixed-rate\ndebt. Changes in the fair value of derivatives\ndesignated as fair value hedges, and changes\nin the fair value of the hedged items, are\nrecorded in earnings.\nCash Flow Hedges These derivatives are\ninterest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge\nthe forecasted cash flows from its underlying\nvariable-rate loans and debt. Changes in the\nfair value of derivatives designated as cash\nflow hedges are recorded in other\ncomprehensive income (loss) until the cash\nflows of the hedged items are realized. If a\nderivative designated as a cash flow hedge is\nterminated or ceases to be highly effective,\nthe gain or loss in other comprehensive income\n(loss) is amortized to earnings over the\nperiod the forecasted hedged transactions\nimpact earnings. If a hedged forecasted\ntransaction is no longer probable, hedge\naccounting is ceased and any gain or loss\nincluded in other comprehensive income (loss)\nis reported in earnings immediately, unless\nthe forecasted transaction is at least\nreasonably possible of occurring, whereby the\namounts remain within other comprehensive\nincome (loss). At March 31, 2025, the Company\nhad $ 297million (net-of-tax) of realized and\nunrealized losses on derivatives classified as\ncash flow hedges recorded in other\ncomprehensive income (loss), compared with $\n553million (net-of-tax) of realized and\nunrealized losses at December 31, 2024. The\nestimated amount to be reclassified from other\ncomprehensive income (loss) into earnings\nduring the next 12 months is a loss of $\n152million (net-of-tax). All cash flow hedges\nwere highly effective for the three months\nended March 31, 2025.\nNet Investment Hedges The Company uses forward\ncommitments to sell specified amounts of\ncertain foreign currencies, and non-derivative\ndebt instruments, to hedge the volatility of\nits net investment in foreign operations\ndriven by fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates. The carrying amount of non-\nderivative debt instruments designated as net\ninvestment hedges was $ 1.6billion at March\n31, 2025 and $ 1.3billion at December 31,\n2024.\nOther Derivative Positions The Company enters\ninto free-standing derivatives to mitigate\ninterest rate risk and for other risk\nmanagement purposes. These derivatives include\nforward commitments to sell TBAs and other\ncommitments to sell residential mortgage\nloans, which are used to economically hedge\nthe interest rate risk related to MLHFS and\nunfunded mortgage loan commitments. The\nCompany also enters into interest rate swaps,\nswaptions, forward commitments to buy TBAs,\nU.S. Treasury and SOFR futures and options on\nU.S. Treasury futures to economically hedge\nthe change in the fair value of the Company\u2019s\nMSRs. The Company enters into foreign currency\nforwards to economically hedge remeasurement\ngains and losses the Company recognizes on\nforeign currency denominated assets and\nliabilities. The Company also enters into\ninterest rate swaps as economic hedges of fair\nvalue option elected deposits and long-term\ndebt. In addition, the Company acts as a\nseller and buyer of interest rate, foreign\n                      \n  U.S. Bancorp    51  \n                      \nexchange and commodity contracts for its\ncustomers. The Company mitigates the market,\nfunding and liquidity risk associated with\nthese customer derivatives by entering into\nsimilar offsetting positions with broker-\ndealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering\ninto other derivative or non-derivative\nfinancial instruments that partially or fully\noffset the exposure to earnings from these\ncustomer-related positions. The Company\u2019s\ncustomer derivatives and related hedges are\nmonitored and reviewed by the Company\u2019s Market\nRisk Committee, which establishes policies for\nmarket risk management, including exposure\nlimits for each portfolio. The Company also\nhas derivative contracts that are created\nthrough its operations, including certain\nunfunded mortgage loan commitments and swap\nagreements related to the sale of a portion of\nits Class B common and preferred shares of\nVisa Inc. Refer to Note 14 for further\ninformation on these swap agreements.

\n                                              \nDerivatives are subject to credit risk\nassociated with counterparties to the\nderivative contracts. The Company measures\nthat credit risk using a credit valuation\nadjustment and includes it within the fair\nvalue of the derivative. The Company manages\ncounterparty credit risk through\ndiversification of its derivative positions\namong various counterparties, by entering into\nderivative positions that are centrally\ncleared through clearinghouses, by entering\ninto master netting arrangements and, where\npossible, by requiring collateral\narrangements. A master netting arrangement\nallows two counterparties, who have multiple\nderivative contracts with each other, the\nability to net settle amounts under all\ncontracts, including any related collateral,\nthrough a single payment and in a single\ncurrency. Collateral arrangements generally\nrequire the counterparty to deliver collateral\n(typically cash or U.S. Treasury and agency\nsecurities) equal to the Company\u2019s net\nderivative receivable, subject to minimum\ntransfer and credit rating requirements.\n\nThe Company\u2019s collateral arrangements are\npredominately bilateral and, therefore,\ncontain provisions that require\ncollateralization of the Company\u2019s net\nliability derivative positions. Required\ncollateral coverage is based on net liability\nthresholds and may be contingent upon the\nCompany\u2019s credit rating from two of the\nnationally recognized statistical rating\norganizations. If the Company\u2019s credit rating\nwere to fall below credit ratings thresholds\nestablished in the collateral arrangements,\nthe counterparties to the derivatives could\nrequest immediate additional collateral\ncoverage up to and including full collateral\ncoverage for derivatives in a net liability\nposition. The aggregate fair value of all\nderivatives under collateral arrangements that\nwere in a net liability position at March 31,\n2025, was $ 1.7billion. At March 31, 2025, the\nCompany had $ 1.4billion of cash posted as\ncollateral against this net liability\nposition.\n                      \n  U.S. Bancorp    55  \n                      \n                                              \n             Netting Arrangements for         \n  NOTE 13    Certain Financial Instruments    \n             and Securities                   \n             Financing Activities             \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s derivative portfolio consists of\nbilateral over-the-counter trades, certain\ninterest rate derivatives and credit contracts\nrequired to be centrally cleared through\nclearinghouses per current regulations, and\nexchange-traded positions which may include\nU.S. Treasury and SOFR futures or options on\nU.S. Treasury futures. Of the Company\u2019s $\n1.3trillion total notional amount of\nderivative positions at March 31, 2025, $\n583.8billion related to bilateral over-the-\ncounter trades, $ 696.3billion related to\nthose centrally cleared through clearinghouses\nand $ 19.1billion related to those that were\nexchange-traded. The Company\u2019s derivative\ncontracts typically include offsetting rights\n(referred to as netting arrangements), and\ndepending on expected volume, credit risk, and\ncounterparty preference, collateral\nmaintenance may be required. For all\nderivatives under collateral support\narrangements, fair value is determined daily\nand, depending on the collateral maintenance\nrequirements, the Company and a counterparty\nmay receive or deliver collateral, based upon\nthe net fair value of all derivative positions\nbetween the Company and the counterparty.\nCollateral is typically cash, but securities\nmay be allowed under collateral arrangements\nwith certain counterparties. Receivables and\npayables related to cash collateral are\nincluded in other assets and other liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet, along with\nthe related derivative asset and liability\nfair values. Any securities pledged to\ncounterparties as collateral remain on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Securities\nreceived from counterparties as collateral are\nnot recognized on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet, unless the counterparty defaults. In\ngeneral, securities used as collateral can be\nsold, repledged or otherwise used by the party\nin possession. No restrictions exist on the\nuse of cash collateral by either party. Refer\nto Note 12 for further discussion of the\nCompany\u2019s derivatives, including collateral\narrangements.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s treasury and broker-\ndealer operations, the Company executes\ntransactions that are treated as securities\nsold under agreements to repurchase or\nsecurities purchased under agreements to\nresell, both of which are accounted for as\ncollateralized financings. Securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase include\nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned\ntransactions. Securities purchased under\nagreements to resell include reverse\nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed\ntransactions. For securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase, the Company records\na liability for the cash received, which is\nincluded in short-term borrowings on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. For securities\npurchased under agreements to resell, the\nCompany records a receivable for the cash\npaid, which is included in other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nSecurities transferred to counterparties under\nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned\ntransactions continue to be recognized on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, are measured at\nfair value, and are included in investment\nsecurities or other assets. Securities\nreceived from counterparties under reverse\nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed\ntransactions are not recognized on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet unless the\ncounterparty defaults. The securities\ntransferred under repurchase and reverse\nrepurchase transactions typically are U.S.\nTreasury and agency securities, residential\nagency mortgage-backed securities, corporate\ndebt securities or asset-backed securities.\nThe securities loaned or borrowed typically\nare corporate debt securities traded by the\nCompany\u2019s primary broker-dealer subsidiary. In\ngeneral, the securities transferred can be\nsold, repledged or otherwise used by the party\nin possession. No restrictions exist on the\nuse of cash collateral by either party.\nRepurchase/reverse repurchase and securities\nloaned/borrowed transactions expose the\nCompany to counterparty risk. The Company\nmanages this risk by performing assessments,\nindependent of business line managers, and\nestablishing concentration limits on each\ncounterparty. Additionally, these transactions\ninclude collateral arrangements that require\nthe fair values of the underlying securities\nto be determined daily, resulting in cash\nbeing obtained from or refunded to\ncounterparties to maintain specified\ncollateral levels.\n                      \n  56    U.S. Bancorp  \n                      \nThe following table summarizes the maturities\nby category of collateral pledged for\nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned\ntransactions:\n                                              \n                  \u2026                 \u2026         \n            \u2026     \u2026                 \u2026         \n            \u2026     \u2026                 \u2026         \n            \u2026     \u2026                 \u2026         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2014       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2026        5       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n                                              \n         \u2026        \u2014       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2014       \u2014              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2014       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2014       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n                                              \n         \u2026        \u2014       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2014       \u2014              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $         \u2026    \n                                              \nThe Company executes its derivative,\nrepurchase/reverse repurchase and securities\nloaned/borrowed transactions under the\nrespective industry standard agreements.

Additionally, from\ntime to time, the Company may be required to\nrecord at fair value other assets on a\nnonrecurring basis, such as loans held for\nsale, loans held for investment and certain\nother assets. These nonrecurring fair value\nadjustments typically involve application of\nlower-of-cost-or-fair value accounting or\nimpairment write-downs of individual assets.\nOther financial instruments, such as held-to-\nmaturity investment securities, loans, the\nmajority of time deposits, short-term\nborrowings and long-term debt, are accounted\nfor at amortized cost. See \u201cFair Value of\nFinancial Instruments\u201d in this Note for\nfurther information on the estimated fair\nvalue of these other financial instruments. In\naccordance with disclosure guidance, certain\nfinancial instruments, such as deposits with\nno defined or contractual maturity,\nreceivables and payables due in one year or\nless, insurance contracts and equity\ninvestments not accounted for at fair value,\nare excluded from this Note.\nFair value is defined as the exchange price\nthat would be received for an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability (an exit price) in the\nprincipal or most advantageous market for the\nasset or liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants on the measurement\ndate. A fair value measurement reflects all of\nthe assumptions that market participants would\nuse in pricing the asset\n                      \n  58    U.S. Bancorp  \n                      \nor liability, including assumptions about the\nrisk inherent in a particular valuation\ntechnique, the effect of a restriction on the\nsale or use of an asset and the risk of\nnonperformance.\n\nThe Company groups its assets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value into a three-level\nhierarchy for valuation techniques used to\nmeasure financial assets and financial\nliabilities at fair value. This hierarchy is\nbased on whether the valuation inputs are\nobservable or unobservable. These levels are:\n\n\u2022 Level 1 \u2014 Quoted prices in active markets\nfor identical assets or liabilities. Level 1\nincludes U.S. Treasury securities, as well as\nexchange-traded instruments.\n\n\u2022 Level 2 \u2014 Observable inputs other than Level\n1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar\nassets or liabilities; quoted prices in\nmarkets that are not active; or other inputs\nthat are observable or can be corroborated by\nobservable market data for substantially the\nfull term of the assets or liabilities. Level\n2 includes debt securities that are traded\nless frequently than exchange-traded\ninstruments and which are typically valued\nusing third party pricing services; derivative\ncontracts and other assets and liabilities,\nincluding securities, and certain time\ndeposits and structured long-term notes, whose\nvalue is determined using a pricing model with\ninputs that are observable in the market or\ncan be derived principally from or\ncorroborated by observable market data; and\nMLHFS whose values are determined using quoted\nprices for similar assets or pricing models\nwith inputs that are observable in the market\nor can be corroborated by observable market\ndata.\n\n\u2022 Level 3 \u2014 Unobservable inputs that are\nsupported by little or no market activity and\nthat are significant to the fair value of the\nassets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and\nliabilities include financial instruments\nwhose values are determined using pricing\nmodels, discounted cash flow methodologies, or\nsimilar techniques, as well as instruments for\nwhich the determination of fair value requires\nsignificant management judgment or estimation.\nThis category includes MSRs and certain\nderivative contracts.\n\nValuation Methodologies\n\nThe valuation methodologies used by the\nCompany to measure financial assets and\nliabilities at fair value are described below.\nIn addition, the following section includes an\nindication of the level of the fair value\nhierarchy in which the assets or liabilities\nare classified. Where appropriate, the\ndescriptions include information about the\nvaluation models and key inputs to those\nmodels. During the three months ended March\n31, 2025 and 2024, there were no significant\nchanges to the valuation techniques used by\nthe Company to measure fair value.\n\nAvailable-for-Sale Investment Securities When\nquoted market prices for identical securities\nare available in an active market, these\nprices are used to determine fair value and\nthese securities are classified within Level 1\nof the fair value hierarchy. Level 1\ninvestment securities include U.S. Treasury\nand exchange-traded securities.\n\nFor other securities, quoted market prices may\nnot be readily available for the specific\nsecurities. When possible, the Company\ndetermines fair value based on market\nobservable information, including quoted\nmarket prices for similar securities, inactive\ntransaction prices, and broker quotes. These\nsecurities are classified within Level 2 of\nthe fair value hierarchy. Level 2 valuations\nare generally provided by a third-party\npricing service. Level 2 investment securities\nare predominantly agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities, certain other asset-backed\nsecurities, obligations of state and political\nsubdivisions and agency debt securities.\n\nMortgage Loans Held For Sale MLHFS measured at\nfair value, for which an active secondary\nmarket and readily available market prices\nexist, are initially valued at the transaction\nprice and are subsequently valued by\ncomparison to instruments with similar\ncollateral and risk profiles. MLHFS are\nclassified within Level 2. Included in\nmortgage banking revenue were net gains of $\n3million and net losses of $ 1million for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024,\nrespectively, from the changes to fair value\nof these MLHFS under fair value option\naccounting guidance. Changes in fair value due\nto instrument specific credit risk were\nimmaterial. Interest income for MLHFS is\nmeasured based on contractual interest rates\nand reported as interest income on the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. Electing to\nmeasure MLHFS at fair value reduces certain\ntiming differences and better matches changes\nin fair value of these assets with changes in\nthe value of the derivative instruments used\nto economically hedge them without the burden\nof complying with the requirements for hedge\naccounting.\n\nTime Deposits The Company elects the fair\nvalue option to account for certain time\ndeposits that are hedged with derivatives that\ndo not qualify for hedge accounting. Electing\nto measure these time deposits at fair value\nreduces certain timing differences and better\nmatches changes in fair value of these\ndeposits with changes in the value of the\nderivative instruments used to economically\nhedge them. The time deposits measured at fair\nvalue are valued using a discounted cash flow\nmodel that utilizes market observable inputs\nand are classified within Level 2. Included in\ninterest expense on deposits were net gains of\n$ 3million and $ 8million for the three months\nended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively,\nfrom the changes in fair value of time\ndeposits under fair value option accounting\nguidance.\n\nLong-term Debt The Company elects the fair\nvalue option to account for certain structured\nnotes that are hedged with derivatives that do\nnot qualify for hedge accounting. Electing to\nmeasure these structured notes at fair value\nreduces certain timing differences and better\nmatches changes in fair value of these notes\nwith changes in the value of the derivative\ninstruments used to economically hedge them.\nThe structured notes measured at fair value\nare valued using a discounted cash flow model\nthat utilizes market observable inputs and are\nclassified within Level 2. The discount rate\nused in the discounted cash flow model\nincorporates the impact of the Company\u2019s\ncredit spread, which is based on observable\nspreads in the secondary bond market. Changes\nin fair value attributable to instrument\nspecific credit risk are recorded as debit\nvaluation adjustments (\u201cDVA\u201d) in other\ncomprehensive income (loss) with all other\nchanges in fair value recorded in interest\nexpense. Included in other comprehensive\nincome (loss) and interest\n                      \n  U.S. Bancorp    59  \n                      \nexpense on long-term debt were net DVA gains\nof $ 2million and net losses of $ 1million,\nrespectively, for the three months ended March\n31, 2025 from the changes in the fair value of\nstructured notes under the fair value option\naccount guidance.\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights MSRs are valued\nusing a discounted cash flow methodology, and\nare classified within Level 3. The Company\ndetermines fair value of the MSRs by\nprojecting future cash flows for different\ninterest rate scenarios using prepayment rates\nand other assumptions, and discounts these\ncash flows using a risk adjusted rate based on\noption adjusted spread levels. There is\nminimal observable market activity for MSRs on\ncomparable portfolios, and therefore, the\ndetermination of fair value requires\nsignificant management judgment. Refer to Note\n6 for further information on MSR valuation\nassumptions.\n\nDerivatives The majority of derivatives held\nby the Company are executed over-the-counter\nor centrally cleared through clearinghouses\nand are valued using market standard cash flow\nvaluation techniques. The models incorporate\ninputs, depending on the type of derivative,\nincluding interest rate curves, foreign\nexchange rates and volatility. All derivative\nvalues incorporate an assessment of the risk\nof counterparty nonperformance, measured based\non the Company\u2019s evaluation of credit risk\nincluding external assessments of credit risk.\nThe Company monitors and manages its\nnonperformance risk by considering its ability\nto net derivative positions under master\nnetting arrangements, as well as collateral\nreceived or provided under collateral\narrangements. Accordingly, the Company has\nelected to measure the fair value of\nderivatives, at a counterparty level, on a net\nbasis. The majority of the derivatives are\nclassified within Level 2 of the fair value\nhierarchy, as the significant inputs to the\nmodels, including nonperformance risk, are\nobservable. However, certain derivative\ntransactions are with counterparties where\nrisk of nonperformance cannot be observed in\nthe market and, therefore, the credit\nvaluation adjustments result in these\nderivatives being classified within Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe Company also has other derivative\ncontracts that are created through its\noperations, including commitments to purchase\nand originate mortgage loans and swap\nagreements executed in conjunction with the\nsale of a portion of its Class B common and\npreferred shares of Visa Inc. (the \u201cVisa\nswaps\u201d). The mortgage loan commitments are\nvalued by pricing models that include market\nobservable and unobservable inputs, which\nresult in the commitments being classified\nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe unobservable inputs include assumptions\nabout the percentage of commitments that\nactually become a closed loan and the MSR\nvalue that is inherent in the underlying loan\nvalue. The Visa swaps require payments by\neither the Company or the purchaser of the\nVisa Inc. Class B common and preferred shares\nwhen there are changes in the conversion rate\nof the Visa Inc. Class B common and preferred\nshares to Visa Inc. Class A common and\npreferred shares, respectively, as well as\nquarterly payments to the purchaser based on\nspecified terms of the agreements. Management\nreviews and updates the Visa swaps fair value\nin conjunction with its review of Visa Inc.\nrelated litigation contingencies, and the\nassociated escrow funding. The expected\nlitigation resolution impacts the Visa Inc.\nClass B common share to Visa Inc. Class A\ncommon share conversion rate, as well as the\nultimate termination date for the Visa swaps.\nAccordingly, the Visa swaps are classified\nwithin Level 3. Refer to Note 15 for further\ninformation on the Visa Inc. restructuring and\nrelated card association litigation.\n\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs of Level 3\nAssets and Liabilities\n\nThe following section provides information to\nfacilitate an understanding of the uncertainty\nin the fair value measurements for the\nCompany\u2019s Level 3 assets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. This section includes a\ndescription of the significant inputs used by\nthe Company and a description of any\ninterrelationships between these inputs. The\ndiscussion below excludes nonrecurring fair\nvalue measurements of collateral value used\nfor impairment measures for loans and OREO.\nThese valuations utilize third party appraisal\nor broker price opinions, and are classified\nas Level 3 due to the significant judgment\ninvolved.\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights The significant\nunobservable inputs used in the fair value\nmeasurement of the Company\u2019s MSRs are expected\nprepayments and the option adjusted spread\nthat is added to the risk-free rate to\ndiscount projected cash flows. Significant\nincreases in either of these inputs in\nisolation would have resulted in a\nsignificantly lower fair value measurement.\nSignificant decreases in either of these\ninputs in isolation would have resulted in a\nsignificantly higher fair value measurement.\nThere is no direct interrelationship between\nprepayments and option adjusted spread.\nPrepayment rates generally move in the\nopposite direction of market interest rates.\nOption adjusted spread is generally impacted\nby changes in market return requirements.\nThe following table shows the significant\nvaluation assumption ranges for MSRs at March\n31, 2025:\n                                              \n             Mini\u2026        Maxi\u2026    Weigh\u2026     \n                                   Avera\u2026     \n  Exp\u2026    6  %        19  %             9  %  \n  pre\u2026                                        \n  Opt\u2026                                        \n  adj\u2026    5           11                6     \n  spr\u2026                                        \n                                              \n(a) Determined based on the relative fair\nvalue of the related mortgage loans serviced.\n\nDerivatives The Company has two distinct Level\n3 derivative portfolios: (i) the Company\u2019s\ncommitments to purchase and originate mortgage\nloans that meet the requirements of a\nderivative and (ii) the Company\u2019s\nasset/liability and customer-related\nderivatives that are Level 3 due to\nunobservable inputs related to measurement of\nrisk of nonperformance by the counterparty. In\naddition, the Company\u2019s Visa swaps are\nclassified within Level 3.\n\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in\nthe fair value measurement of the Company\u2019s\nderivative commitments to purchase and\noriginate mortgage loans are the percentage of\ncommitments that actually become a closed loan\nand the MSR value that is\n                      \n  60    U.S. Bancorp  \n                      \ninherent in the underlying loan value. A\nsignificant increase in the rate of loans that\nclose would have resulted in a larger\nderivative asset or liability. A significant\nincrease in the inherent MSR value would have\nresulted in an increase in the derivative\nasset or a reduction in the derivative\nliability. Expected loan close rates and the\ninherent MSR values are directly impacted by\nchanges in market rates and will generally\nmove in the same direction as interest rates.\nThe following table shows the significant\nvaluation assumption ranges for the Company\u2019s\nderivative commitments to purchase and\noriginate mortgage loans at March 31, 2025:\n                                              \n              Mini\u2026         Maxi\u2026    Wei\u2026     \n                                     Ave\u2026     \n  Exp\u2026                                        \n  loan     5  %        100  %          81  %  \n  clo\u2026                                        \n  rate                                        \n  Inh\u2026                                        \n  MSR                                         \n  val\u2026                                        \n  (ba\u2026    57           200            110     \n  poi\u2026                                        \n  per                                         \n  loa\u2026                                        \n                                              \n(a) Determined based on the relative fair\nvalue of the related mortgage loans.\n\nThe significant unobservable input used in the\nfair value measurement of certain of the\nCompany\u2019s asset/liability and customer-related\nderivatives is the credit valuation adjustment\nrelated to the risk of counterparty\nnonperformance. A significant increase in the\ncredit valuation adjustment would have\nresulted in a lower fair value measurement. A\nsignificant decrease in the credit valuation\nadjustment would have resulted in a higher\nfair value measurement. The credit valuation\nadjustment is impacted by changes in market\nrates, volatility, market implied credit\nspreads, and loss recovery rates, as well as\nthe Company\u2019s assessment of the counterparty\u2019s\ncredit position. At March 31, 2025, the\nminimum, maximum and weighted-average credit\nvaluation adjustment as a percentage of the\nnet fair value of the counterparty\u2019s\nderivative contracts prior to adjustment was 0\npercent, 367percent and 2percent,\nrespectively.\n\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in\nthe fair value measurement of the Visa swaps\nare management\u2019s estimate of the probability\nof certain litigation scenarios occurring, and\nthe timing of the resolution of the related\nlitigation loss estimates in excess, or\nshortfall, of the Company\u2019s proportional share\nof escrow funds. An increase in the loss\nestimate or a delay in the resolution of the\nrelated litigation would have resulted in an\nincrease in the derivative liability. A\ndecrease in the loss estimate or an\nacceleration of the resolution of the related\nlitigation would have resulted in a decrease\nin the derivative liability.\n                      \n  U.S. Bancorp    61  \n                      \nThe following table summarizes the balances of\nassets and liabilities measured at fair value\non a recurring basis:\n                                              \n            \u2026        \u2026                        \n            1        2              \u2026         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2014    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n         \u2014        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n                                              \n         \u2014        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2014        7       \u2014              7    \n         \u2014        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2014        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2014        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2014        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2014        \u2014       \u2026              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n      $  \u2014     $  \u2026       \u2014    $         \u2026    \n         \u2014        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2014    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n         \u2014        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n                                              \n         \u2014        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2014        6       \u2014              6    \n         \u2014        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2014        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2014        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2014        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2014        \u2014       \u2026              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n      $  \u2014     $  \u2026       \u2014    $         \u2026    \n         \u2014        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2014              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \nNote: Excluded from the table above are equity\ninvestments without readily determinable fair\nvalues.

In\n2007, Visa completed a restructuring and\nissued shares of Visa Inc. common stock to its\nfinancial institution members in contemplation\nof its initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d)\ncompleted in the first quarter of 2008 (the\n\u201cVisa Reorganization\u201d). As a part of the Visa\nReorganization, the Company received its\nproportionate number of shares of Visa Inc.\ncommon stock, which were subsequently\nconverted to Class B shares of Visa Inc.\n(\u201cClass B shares\u201d). As of March 31, 2025, the\nCompany has sold substantially all of its\nClass B shares.\nVisa U.S.A. Inc. (\u201cVisa U.S.A.\u201d) and\nMasterCard International (collectively, the\n\u201cCard Brands\u201d) are defendants in antitrust\nlawsuits challenging the practices of the Card\nBrands (the \u201cVisa Litigation\u201d). Visa U.S.A.\nmember banks have a contingent obligation to\nindemnify Visa Inc. under the Visa U.S.A.\nbylaws (which were modified at the time of the\nrestructuring in October 2007) for potential\nlosses arising from the Visa Litigation. The\nindemnification by the Visa U.S.A. member\nbanks has no specific maximum amount. Using\nproceeds from its IPO and through reductions\nto the conversion ratio applicable to the\nClass B shares held by Visa U.S.A. member\nbanks, Visa Inc. has funded an escrow account\nfor the benefit of member financial\ninstitutions to fund their indemnification\nobligations associated with the Visa\nLitigation. The receivable related to the\nescrow account is classified in other\nliabilities and fully offsets the related Visa\nLitigation contingent liability.\nIn October 2012, Visa signed a settlement\nagreement to resolve merchant class action\nclaims associated with the multidistrict\ninterchange litigation pending in the United\nStates District Court for the Eastern District\nof New York (the \u201cMulti-District Litigation\u201d).\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit reversed the approval of that\nsettlement and remanded the matter to the\ndistrict court. Thereafter, the case was split\ninto two putative class actions, one seeking\ndamages (the \u201cDamages Action\u201d) and a separate\nclass action seeking injunctive relief only\n(the \u201cInjunctive Action\u201d). The Damages Action\nwas settled and is fully resolved. A number of\nmerchants opted out of the Damages Action\nclass settlement and filed individual cases in\nvarious federal district courts. Some of those\ncases have been settled and others are still\nbeing litigated. In March 2024, Visa signed a\nsettlement agreement to resolve the Injunctive\nAction. In June 2024, the court declined to\ngrant preliminary approval of the proposed\nsettlement, which provided for lower\ninterchange fees and various other rule\nchanges for U.S. merchants. Accordingly, the\nInjunctive Action continues.\nOther Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities\nThe following table is a summary of other\nguarantees and contingent liabilities of the\nCompany at March 31, 2025:\n                                              \n                                  Max\u2026        \n  (D\u2026                             Pot\u2026        \n  in        Col\u2026       Car\u2026       Fut\u2026        \n  Mi\u2026       Held       Amo\u2026       Pay\u2026        \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  St\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026    $     \u2014    $    20    $  10,\u2026        \n  of                                          \n  cr\u2026                                         \n  Se\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026       6,9\u2026          \u2014       6,7\u2026        \n  in\u2026                                         \n  As\u2026          \u2014        107       12,\u2026    -a  \n  sa\u2026                                         \n  Me\u2026        826         63       147\u2026        \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  Ot\u2026          \u2014         21       3,6\u2026        \n                                              \n(a) The maximum potential future payments do\nnot include loan sales where the Company\nprovides standard representation and\nwarranties to the buyer against losses related\nto loan underwriting documentation defects\nthat may have existed at the time of sale that\ngenerally are identified after the occurrence\nof a triggering event such as delinquency. For\nthese types of loan sales, the maximum\npotential future payments is generally the\nunpaid principal balance of loans sold\nmeasured at the end of the current reporting\nperiod. Actual losses will be significantly\nless than the maximum exposure, as only a\nfraction of loans sold will have a\nrepresentation and warranty breach, and any\nlosses on repurchase would generally be\nmitigated by any collateral held against the\nloans.\nMerchant Processing The Company, through its\nsubsidiaries, provides merchant processing\nservices. Under the rules of credit card\nassociations, a merchant processor retains a\ncontingent liability for credit card\ntransactions processed. This contingent\nliability arises in the event of a billing\ndispute between the merchant and a cardholder\nthat is ultimately resolved in the\ncardholder\u2019s favor. In this situation, the\ntransaction is \u201ccharged-back\u201d to the merchant\nand the disputed amount is credited or\notherwise refunded to the cardholder. If the\nCompany is unable to collect this amount from\nthe merchant, it bears the loss for the amount\nof the refund paid to the cardholder.\nThe Company currently processes card\ntransactions in the United States, Canada and\nEurope through wholly-owned subsidiaries. In\nthe event a merchant was unable to fulfill\nproduct or services subject to future\ndelivery, such as airline tickets, the Company\ncould become financially liable for refunding\nthe purchase price of such products or\nservices purchased through the credit card\nassociations under the charge-back provisions.\nCharge-back risk related to these merchants is\nevaluated in a manner similar to credit risk\nassessments and, as such, merchant processing\ncontracts contain various provisions to\nprotect the Company in the event of default.\nAt March 31, 2025, the value of airline\ntickets purchased to be delivered at a future\ndate through card transactions processed by\nthe Company was $ 12.3billion. The Company\nheld collateral of $ 706million in escrow\ndeposits, letters of credit and indemnities\nfrom financial institutions, and liens on\nvarious assets related to these airline\nprocessing arrangements. In addition to\nspecific collateral or other credit\nenhancements, the Company maintains a\nliability for its implied guarantees\nassociated with future delivery. At March 31,\n2025, the liability was $ 40million primarily\nrelated to these airline processing\narrangements.\n                      \n  U.S. Bancorp    65  \n                      \nAsset Sales The Company regularly sells loans\nto GSEs as part of its mortgage banking\nactivities. The Company provides customary\nrepresentations and warranties to GSEs in\nconjunction with these sales. These\nrepresentations and warranties generally\nrequire the Company to repurchase assets if it\nis subsequently determined that a loan did not\nmeet specified criteria, such as a\ndocumentation deficiency or rescission of\nmortgage insurance. If the Company is unable\nto cure or refute a repurchase request, the\nCompany is generally obligated to repurchase\nthe loan or otherwise reimburse the GSE for\nlosses. At March 31, 2025 and December 31,\n2024, the Company had reserved $ 9million for\npotential losses from representation and\nwarranty obligations. The Company\u2019s reserve\nreflects management\u2019s best estimate of losses\nfor representation and warranty obligations.\nThe Company\u2019s repurchase reserve is modeled at\nthe loan level, taking into consideration the\nindividual credit quality and borrower\nactivity that has transpired since\norigination. The model applies credit quality\nand economic risk factors to derive a\nprobability of default and potential\nrepurchase that are based on the Company\u2019s\nhistorical loss experience, and estimates loss\nseverity based on expected collateral value.\nThe Company also considers qualitative factors\nthat may result in anticipated losses\ndiffering from historical loss trends.\n\nAs of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,\nthe Company had $ 18million and $ 15million,\nrespectively, of unresolved representation and\nwarranty claims from GSEs. The Company does\nnot have a significant amount of unresolved\nclaims from investors other than GSEs.\n\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters\n\nThe Company is subject to various litigation\nand regulatory matters that arise from the\nconduct of its business activities. The\nCompany establishes reserves for such matters\nwhen potential losses become probable and can\nbe reasonably estimated. The Company believes\nthe ultimate resolution of existing legal and\nregulatory matters will not have a material\nadverse effect on the financial condition,\nresults of operations or cash flows of the\nCompany. However, in light of the\nuncertainties inherent in these matters, it is\npossible that the ultimate resolution of one\nor more of these matters may have a material\nadverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of\noperations for a particular period, and future\nchanges in circumstances or additional\ninformation could result in additional\naccruals or resolution in excess of\nestablished accruals, which could adversely\naffect the Company\u2019s results of operations,\npotentially materially.\n\nResidential Mortgage-Backed Securities\nLitigation Starting in 2011, the Company and\nother large financial institutions have been\nsued in their capacity as trustee for\nresidential mortgage\u2013backed securities trusts\nfor losses arising out of the 2008 financial\ncrisis. In the lawsuits brought against the\nCompany, the investors allege that the\nCompany\u2019s banking subsidiary, USBNA, as\ntrustee caused them to incur substantial\nlosses by failing to enforce loan repurchase\nobligations and failing to abide by\nappropriate standards of care after events of\ndefault allegedly occurred. The plaintiffs in\nthese matters seek monetary damages in\nunspecified amounts and most also seek\nequitable relief.\n\nRegulatory Matters The Company is continually\nsubject to examinations, inquiries,\ninvestigations and other forms of regulatory\nand governmental inquiry or scrutiny covering\na wide range of issues in its financial\nservices businesses including in areas of\nheightened regulatory scrutiny, such as\ncompliance, risk management, third-party risk\nmanagement and consumer protection. In some\ncases, these matters are part of reviews of\nspecified activities at multiple industry\nparticipants; in others, they are directed at\nthe Company individually. The Company is\ncooperating fully with all pending\nexaminations, inquiries and investigations,\nany of which could lead to administrative or\nlegal proceedings or settlements. Remedies in\nthese proceedings or settlements may include\nfines, penalties, restitution or alterations\nin the Company\u2019s business practices (which may\nincrease the Company\u2019s operating expenses and\ndecrease its revenue).\n\nThe Division of Enforcement of the SEC\nconducted an investigation of U.S. Bancorp\nFund Services, LLC, a subsidiary of USBNA,\nrelating to fraud committed by an unaffiliated\nthird party. On March 19, 2025, the SEC\nnotified the Company that it had concluded its\ninvestigation, and based on the information\nthe SEC had as of that date, the SEC staff did\nnot intend to recommend an enforcement action.\n\nOutlook Due to their complex nature, it can be\nyears before litigation and regulatory matters\nare resolved. The Company may be unable to\ndevelop an estimate or range of loss where\nmatters are in early stages, there are\nsignificant factual or legal issues to be\nresolved, damages are unspecified or\nuncertain, or there is uncertainty as to a\nlitigation class being certified or the\noutcome of pending motions, appeals or\nproceedings. For those litigation and\nregulatory matters where the Company has\ninformation to develop an estimate or range of\nloss, the Company believes the upper end of\nthe range of reasonably possible losses in\naggregate, in excess of any reserves\nestablished for matters where a loss is\nconsidered probable, will not be material to\nits financial condition, results of operations\nor cash flows. The Company\u2019s estimates are\nsubject to significant judgment and\nuncertainties, and the matters underlying the\nestimates will change from time to time.\nActual results may vary significantly from the\ncurrent estimates.\n                      \n  66    U.S. Bancorp  \n                      \n                                \n  NOTE 16    Business Segments  \n                                \nThe Company's management reporting is\norganized into threereportable operating\nsegments aligned by major lines of business\nbased on the products and services provided to\ncustomers through its distribution channels.\nAll other business activities not included in\nthe reportable operating segments are included\nin the Treasury and Corporate Support business\nsegment. The chief operating decision maker\nuses net interest income on a taxable-\nequivalent basis, noninterest income and net\nincome (loss) before income taxes for all\nreportable segments in deciding how to\nallocate resources during the annual budget\nand monthly forecasting process. The chief\noperating decision maker considers variances\nin reported results to forecasts and variances\nto prior periods to assess performance. The\nCompany\u2019s chief operating decision maker is\nthe Chief Executive Officer. The Company has\nthe following reportable operating and other\nbusiness segments:\nWealth, Corporate, Commercial and\nInstitutional Banking Wealth, Corporate,\nCommercial and Institutional Banking provides\ncore banking, specialized lending, transaction\nand payment processing, capital markets, asset\nmanagement, and brokerage and investment\nrelated services to wealth, middle market,\nlarge corporate, commercial real estate,\ngovernment and institutional clients.\nConsumer and Business Banking Consumer and\nBusiness Banking comprises consumer banking,\nsmall business banking and consumer lending.\nProducts and services are delivered through\nbanking offices, telephone servicing and\nsales, online services, direct mail, ATMs,\nmobile devices, distributed mortgage loan\nofficers, and intermediary relationships\nincluding auto dealerships, mortgage banks,\nand strategic business partners.\nPayment Services Payment Services includes\nconsumer and business credit cards, stored-\nvalue cards, debit cards, corporate,\ngovernment and purchasing card services and\nmerchant processing.\nTreasury and Corporate Support Treasury and\nCorporate Support includes the Company\u2019s\ninvestment portfolios, funding, capital\nmanagement, interest rate risk management,\nincome taxes not allocated to business\nsegments, including most investments in tax-\nadvantaged projects, and the residual\naggregate of those expenses associated with\ncorporate activities that are managed on a\nconsolidated basis.\nBasis of Presentation Business segment results\nare derived from the Company\u2019s business unit\nprofitability reporting systems by\nspecifically attributing managed balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and\ntheir related income or expense. The allowance\nfor credit losses and related provision\nexpense are allocated to the business segments\naccording to the volume and credit quality of\nthe loan balances managed, but with the impact\nof changes in economic forecasts recorded in\nTreasury and Corporate Support. Goodwill and\nother intangible assets are assigned to the\nbusiness segments based on the mix of business\nof an entity acquired by the Company. Within\nthe Company, capital levels are evaluated and\nmanaged centrally; however, capital is\nallocated to the business segments to support\nevaluation of business performance. Business\nsegments are allocated capital on a risk-\nadjusted basis considering economic and\nregulatory capital requirements. Generally,\nthe determination of the amount of capital\nallocated to each business segment includes\ncredit allocations following a Basel III\nregulatory framework. Interest income and\nexpense is determined based on the assets and\nliabilities managed by the business segment.\nBecause funding and asset/liability management\nis a central function, funds transfer-pricing\nmethodologies are utilized to allocate a cost\nof funds used or credit for funds provided to\nall business segment assets and liabilities,\nrespectively, using a matched funding concept.\nAlso, each business unit is allocated the\ntaxable-equivalent benefit of tax-exempt\nproducts. The residual effect on net interest\nincome of asset/liability management\nactivities is included in Treasury and\nCorporate Support. Noninterest income and\nexpenses directly managed by each business\nsegment, including fees, service charges,\nsalaries and benefits, and other direct\nrevenues and costs, are accounted for within\neach segment\u2019s financial results in a manner\nsimilar to the consolidated financial\nstatements. Occupancy costs are allocated\nbased on utilization of facilities by the\nbusiness segments. Generally, operating losses\nare charged to the business segment when the\nloss event is realized in a manner similar to\na loan charge-off. Noninterest expenses\nincurred by centrally managed operations or\nbusiness segments that directly support\nanother business segment\u2019s operations are\ncharged to the applicable business segment\nbased on its utilization of those services,\nprimarily measured by the volume of customer\nactivities, number of employees or other\nrelevant factors. These allocated expenses are\nreported as net shared services expense within\nnoninterest expense. Certain activities that\ndo not directly support the operations of the\nbusiness segments or for which the business\nsegments are not considered financially\naccountable in evaluating their performance\nare not charged to the business segments. The\nincome or expenses associated with these\ncorporate activities, including merger and\nintegration charges, are reported within the\nTreasury and Corporate Support business\nsegment. Income taxes are assessed to each\nbusiness segment at a standard tax rate with\nthe residual tax expense or benefit to arrive\nat the consolidated effective tax rate\nincluded in Treasury and Corporate Support.\nDesignations, assignments and allocations\nchange from time to time as management systems\nare enhanced, methods of evaluating\nperformance or product lines change or\nbusiness segments are realigned to better\nrespond to the Company\u2019s diverse customer\nbase. During 2025 and 2024, certain\norganization and methodology changes were\nmade, including revising the Company\u2019s\nbusiness segment funds transfer-pricing\nmethodology related to deposits and loans\nduring the second quarter of 2024.
