Change in Fiscal   \n  Year.On April\u00a020, 2021, the Board of        \n  Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) of U.S. Bancorp     \n  (the \u201cCompany\u201d) approved and adopted        \n  amendments to the Company\u2019s Amended and     \n  Restated Bylaws (as so amended, the         \n  \u201cBylaws\u201d) to add a federal exclusive forum  \n  provision and make certain other            \n  modifications and clarifications.Section\u00a0   \n  3(b) of Article VIII has been added and     \n  provides that, unless the Company consents  \n  in writing to the selection of an           \n  alternative forum, the federal district     \n  courts of the United States shall be the    \n  exclusive forum for any action asserting a  \n  cause of action arising under the           \n  Securities Act of 1933 or any rule or       \n  regulation promulgated thereunder, to the   \n  fullest extent permitted by law. A          \n  provision regarding notice to stockholders  \n  of both the Company\u2019s state and federal     \n  exclusive forum provisions has also been    \n  added (Section 3(c) of Article VIII).The    \n  other changes made to the Bylaws are as     \n  follows:\u2022Section\u00a03 of Article II has been   \n  updated to provide that stockholders who    \n  request a special meeting must provide the  \n  Company notice of any reduction in their    \n  holdings prior to the requested meeting     \n  and acknowledge that a reduction below the  \n  requisite shares of stock to call a         \n  special meeting is deemed a revocation of   \n  the request to call the special             \n  meeting.\u2022Section\u00a07 of Article II has been   \n  updated to clarify the authority of the     \n  chair of stockholder meetings to, among     \n  other things, adjourn meetings, and to      \n  appoint inspectors of                       \n  elections.\u2022Clarifications have been added   \n  where applicable to confirm that            \n  adjournments or postponements of            \n  stockholder meetings do not create new      \n  notice periods under the Bylaws and to      \n  clarify the time period for receipt of      \n  stockholder proposals.\u2022Section\u00a08 of         \n  Article II has been revised to make clear   \n  that the number of persons a stockholder    \n  may nominate for election as a director     \n  may not exceed the number of directors to   \n  be elected at the applicable stockholder    \n  meeting and that a nominating stockholder   \n  must provide an acknowledgement that,       \n  consistent with the proxy access            \n  provisions, if he or she does not appear,   \n  in person or by proxy, at the relevant      \n  meeting, the Company is not required to     \n  present his or her nominee for a vote at    \n  such meeting. Other procedural              \n  clarifications regarding time periods for   \n  nominations and types of information to be  \n  provided by nominees were made. These       \n  clarifications also apply to nominations    \n  made under proxy access.\u2022Section\u00a010 of      \n  Article II has been revised to provide,     \n  among other changes, that stockholder       \n  nominees must agree to meet with the        \n  governance committee of the Board at the    \n  committee\u2019s reasonable request. The proxy   \n  access provisions have also been revised    \n  to clarify that the Company may omit a      \n  proxy access nomination following the       \n  receipt of notice that a stockholder also   \n  intends to nominate a director through the  \n  director nomination provisions, regardless  \n  of whether the separate nomination is       \n  later withdrawn or settled.\u2022Certain         \n  provisions of Article III regarding Board   \n  meetings have been updated to include       \n  references to remote meetings of the Board  \n  and to add the lead director to the list    \n  of persons who can call special Board       \n  meetings.\u2022Section\u00a01 of Article X has been   \n  updated to reference epidemics, pandemics   \n  and declarations of national emergency by   \n  the United States government and to         \n  conform to and reference the relevant       \n  provisions of the Delaware General          \n  Corporation Law. The list of officers that  \n  can be deemed directors under the           \n  emergency bylaw (Section 3 of Article X)    \n  has also been updated to reflect current    \n  officer titles.\u2022A number                    \n  ofnon-substantive,ministerial, clarifying   \n  and conforming changes were made as         \n  well.The foregoing summary is qualified in  \n  its entirety by reference to the Bylaws, a  \n  copy of which is attached hereto as         \n  Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by   \n  reference.2                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Item\u00a09.01.
