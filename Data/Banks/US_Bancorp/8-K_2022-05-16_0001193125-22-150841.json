Other Events  \n                            \nIn September 2021, U.S. Bancorp announced that\nit had entered into a definitive acquisition  \nagreement to acquire the core regional banking\nfranchise of MUFG Union Bank, N.A. Closing of \nthe transaction is subject to customary       \nclosing conditions, including regulatory      \napprovals which are not within U.S. Bancorp\u2019s \ncontrol. U.S. Bancorp no longer expects to    \nreceive U.S. regulatory approvals in time to  \nallow for closing to occur in the first half  \nof 2022; however, the parties continue to make\nsignificant progress in planning for closing  \nand integration while awaiting regulatory     \napprovals. At this time, U.S. Bancorp expects \nclosing and system integration to occur in the\nsecond half of 2022. \u201cSafe Harbor\u201d Statement  \nunder the Private Securities Litigation Reform\nAct of 1995: This current report on Form      \n8-Kcontains forward-looking statements about  \nU.S. Bancorp. Statements that are not         \nhistorical or current facts, including        \nstatements about beliefs and expectations, are\nforward-looking statements and are based on   \nthe information available to, and assumptions \nand estimates made by, management as of the   \ndate hereof. These forward-looking statements \ncover, among other things, anticipated future \nrevenue and expenses and the future plans and \nprospects of U.S. Bancorp. Forward-looking    \nstatements often use words such as            \n\u201canticipates,\u201d \u201ctargets,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201chopes,\u201d \n\u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d         \n\u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cgoals,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d      \n\u201ccontinue\u201d and other similar expressions or   \nfuture or conditional verbs such as \u201cwill,\u201d   \n\u201cmay,\u201d \u201cmight,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwould\u201d and \u201ccould.\u201d\nForward-looking statements involve inherent   \nrisks and uncertainties, including the        \nfollowing risks and uncertainties and the     \nrisks and uncertainties more fully discussed  \nin the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of     \nExhibit 13 to U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Annual Report on \nForm 10-K forthe year ended December 31, 2021,\nwhich could cause actual results to differ    \nmaterially from those anticipated. The        \nCOVID-19pandemic is adversely affecting U.S.  \nBancorp, its customers, counterparties,       \nemployees, and third-party service providers, \nand the ultimate extent of the impacts on its \nbusiness, financial position, results of      \noperations, liquidity, and prospects is       \nuncertain. Continued deterioration in general \nbusiness and economic conditions or turbulence\nin domestic or global financial markets could \nadversely affect U.S. Bancorp\u2019s revenues and  \nthe values of its assets and liabilities,     \nreduce the availability of funding to certain \nfinancial institutions, lead to a tightening  \nof credit, and increase stock price           \nvolatility. In addition, changes to statutes, \nregulations, or regulatory policies or        \npractices could affect U.S. Bancorp in        \nsubstantial and unpredictable ways. U.S.      \nBancorp\u2019s results could also be adversely     \naffected by changes in interest rates;        \nincreases in unemployment rates; deterioration\nin the credit quality of its loan portfolios  \nor in the value of the collateral securing    \nthose loans; deterioration in the value of its\ninvestment securities; legal and regulatory   \ndevelopments; litigation; increased           \ncompetition from both banks and non-banks;    \ncivilunrest; the effects of climate change;   \nchanges in customer behavior and preferences; \nbreaches in data security, including as a     \nresult of work-from-home arrangements;        \nfailures to safeguard personal information;   \nthe impacts of international hostilities or   \ngeopolitical events; effects of mergers and   \nacquisitions and related integration; effects \nof critical accounting policies and judgments;\nand management\u2019s ability to effectively manage\ncredit risk, market risk, operational risk,   \ncompliance risk, strategic risk, interest rate\nrisk, liquidity risk and reputation risk. In  \naddition, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s proposed acquisition \nof MUFG Union Bank presents risks and         \nuncertainties, including, among others: the   \nrisk that the cost savings, any revenue       \nsynergies and other anticipated benefits of   \nthe proposed acquisition may not be realized  \nor may take longer than anticipated to be     \nrealized; the risk that U.S. Bancorp\u2019s        \nbusiness could be disrupted as a result of the\nannouncement and pendency of the proposed     \nacquisition and diversion of management\u2019s     \nattention from ongoing business operations and\nopportunities; the possibility that the       \nproposed acquisition, including the           \nintegration of MUFG Union Bank, may be more   \ncostly or difficult to complete than          \nanticipated; delays in closing the proposed   \nacquisition; and the failure of required      \ngovernmental approvals to be obtained or any  \nother closing conditions in the definitive    \npurchase agreement to be satisfied. For       \ndiscussion of these and other risks that may  \ncause actual results to differ from those     \ndescribed in forward-looking statements, refer\nto U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Annual Report on Form       \n10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2021, on  \nfile with the Securities and Exchange         \nCommission, including the sections entitled   \n\u201cCorporate Risk Profile\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d   \ncontained in Exhibit 13, and all subsequent   \nfilings with the Securities and Exchange      \nCommission under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or \n15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. \nIn addition, factors other than these risks   \nalso could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp\u2019s    \nresults, and the reader should not consider   \nthese risks to be a complete set of all       \npotential risks or uncertainties. Readers are \ncautioned not to place undue reliance on any  \nforward-looking statements.
