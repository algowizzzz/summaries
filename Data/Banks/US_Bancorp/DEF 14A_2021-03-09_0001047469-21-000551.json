 \n  This last year challenged our strength,     \n  resiliency and flexibility, but we          \n  persevered. I am proud of our employees     \n  and our ability to overcome the obstacles   \n  that were ahead                             \n  of us. I appreciate the customers who       \n  relied on us to be their financial partner  \n  during an unprecedented time. I also am     \n  grateful for the way we helped more than    \n  108,000 small businesses obtain Paycheck    \n  Protection Program loans, provided          \n  forbearance                                 \n  programs, and extended credit to companies  \n  when they needed it.    We frequently talk  \n  about our ability to deliver consistently   \n  solid results, steady approach to credit    \n  and                                         \n  risk management, financial discipline and   \n  intentionally diversified business          \n  portfolio. We know this allows us to        \n  create value and shareholder returns in     \n  any environment.                            \n  That success is due to our employees, our   \n  culture and approach to business. Our       \n  balanced strategy helped us weather the     \n  challenges of 2020, when tailwinds became   \n  headwinds and economies shut down due to    \n  the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the          \n  obstacles we                                \n  faced, we kept people healthy and safe. We  \n  served millions of customers and ran our    \n  business effectively\u00a0\u0097 even with most of     \n  our employees working remotely. We          \n  reinforced our commitment to the            \n  communities where we do business, and we    \n  redoubled our efforts to help bridge        \n  social and economic gaps.    We             \n  reprioritized our efforts, invested in the  \n  areas that would accelerate our strategy,   \n  and made sure that we                       \n  addressed short-term needs while ensuring   \n  long-term success. In the end, we           \n  continued to show that we are more than an  \n  essential service. We have been and         \n  continue to be ready, willing and able to   \n  serve our customers in the moments that     \n  matter most.                                \n  Perhaps more importantly, we are an         \n  organization of people committed to each    \n  other, our communities and our              \n  shareholders. Relationships, trust and      \n  purpose are the heart of everything we do.  \n  We expect to see signs of recovery          \n  throughout 2021, due in part to the         \n  possibility of additional economic          \n  stimulus efforts and greater availability   \n  of the COVID-19 vaccine. We are ready for   \n  a                                           \n  return to more of a normal state and        \n  expect to move quickly when that time       \n  comes.

Our company was    \n  faced with determining how to deliver       \n  essential financial services in a           \n  pandemic,                                   \n  examining how to better facilitate and      \n  accelerate racial equity and inclusion,     \n  and pivoting to remote working as we acted  \n  as a conduit of government assistance to    \n  individuals and businesses. The demands     \n  were tremendous for U.S. Bank management    \n  and                                         \n  their teams. On behalf of the Board of      \n  Directors, I want to assure you they not    \n  only rose to the challenge, they went       \n  above and beyond to identify opportunities  \n  to serve and provide support for our        \n  customers and communities.    Although our  \n  Board was able to meet in person only one   \n  time during the year, we quickly adjusted   \n  to frequent virtual meetings to provide     \n  effective oversight and counsel throughout  \n  the year. The                               \n  culture of collaboration and candid dialog  \n  that we have built over the years served    \n  us well as we adapted to new ways of        \n  working. It also allowed us to oversee the  \n  company's many initiatives to rapidly       \n  adapt to the changing environment and       \n  evaluate                                    \n  its strategic priorities.    We have        \n  entered 2021 more confident than ever that  \n  U.S. Bancorp has the agility, stamina,      \n  talent and vision to provide leadership in  \n  turbulent                                   \n  times, to serve customers needs as new      \n  challenges and opportunities arise, and to  \n  take action on critical and strategic       \n  issues for the benefit of all its           \n  stakeholders. We also are pleased with the  \n  upcoming release of the company's first     \n  ESG report                                  \n  this year, which describes key focus areas  \n  for environmental, social and governance    \n  excellence.

Thirteen of our current\ndirectors have been nominated for election by\nthe Board to hold office until the 2022 annual\nmeeting and the election of their successors.\nMarc N. Casper is currently serving as a\ndirector but will not stand for re-election at\nthe 2021 annual meeting.\n\nAll of the nominees currently serve on our\nBoard. Kimberly N. Ellison-Taylor was\nappointed a director by the Board in January\n2021. Each of the other nominees has\npreviously been elected by the shareholders.\nThe Board has determined that, except for\nAndrew Cecere, our Chairman, President and\nChief Executive Officer, each nominee for\nelection as a director at the annual meeting\nis independent from U.S. Bancorp as discussed\nlater in this proxy statement under \"Corporate\nGovernance \u0097 Director Independence.\"\n                                              \n  Director selection and nomination           \n  considerations                              \n                                              \nDirector nominee selection process\n\nThe selection process for first-time director\ncandidates includes the following steps:\n\nDirector candidates recommended by\nshareholders are given the same consideration\nas candidates suggested by a search firm,\ndirectors or executive officers. A shareholder\nseeking to recommend a prospective candidate\nfor the Governance Committee's consideration\nshould submit the candidate's name and\nsufficient written information about the\ncandidate to permit a determination by the\nGovernance Committee of whether the candidate\nmeets the director selection criteria set\nforth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.\nRecommendations should be sent to the Chair of\nthe Governance Committee in care of the\nCorporate Secretary of U.S. Bancorp at the\naddress listed on page 75 of this proxy\nstatement.\n\nCommitment to Board diversity\n\nOur company is committed to diversity, equity\nand inclusion. Our Board is focused on\ndiversity within its membership in order to\nbenefit from a variety of perspectives,\nexperiences and skill sets in exercising its\noversight role. The Board's commitment to\ndiversity is reflected in our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, which require that any\ndirector search firm used to identify external\ncandidates for a Board vacancy will be\nrequested to present a diverse slate of\ncandidates.\n\nDirector nomination considerations\n\nOur Governance Committee continuously assesses\nthe evolving opportunities and challenges\nfacing our company in order to align the\nBoard's composition with our company's\nleadership needs and strategic direction. When\nnominating new and incumbent directors, our\nGovernance Committee considers the following\nfactors:\n                  \n  \u200b             \u200b   \n  \u200b             \u200b   \n  \u200b                \n  U.S.            \n  Bancorp      \u200b   \n  2021         8  \n  Proxy           \n  Statement       \n                  \nTable of Contents\n                                     \n  \u200b                                   \n  Proposal 1\u00a0\u0097 Election of directors  \n                                     \nThe Governance Committee applies certain\ncriteria to identify the skills, experiences\nand professional qualifications that are\nlikely to be strong indicators of an\nindividual's unique contribution to the\nBoard's collective oversight work. These\ncriteria, along with the number of our\nnominees who possess each skill or\nqualification and the ways these experiences\ncontribute to the Board's collective oversight\nof the development and

The\nBoard's commitment to refreshment can require\ncandid conversations with individual directors\nwhen the Governance Committee has determined\nthat a different board composition would\nincrease the Board's effectiveness. As a\nresult of the Board evaluation and skills-to-\nstrategy alignment processes, directors may\ndecide or be asked not to stand for re-\nelection at the next annual meeting.\n                              \n  2021 nominees for director  \n                              \nEach of the director nominees named below has\nagreed to serve as a director if elected.\nProxies may not be voted for more than 13\nnominees.

Our Board of Directors has\nadopted Corporate Governance Guidelines to\nprovide a corporate governance framework for\nour directors and management to effectively\npursue our objectives for the benefit of our\nshareholders. The Board reviews and updates\nthese guidelines and the charters of the Board\ncommittees at least annually in response to\nevolving best practices and the results of\nannual Board and committee evaluations.

Baxter, Dorothy J.\nBridges, Elizabeth L. Buse, Marc N. Casper,\nKimberly N. Ellison-Taylor, Kimberly J.\nHarris, Roland A. Hernandez, Olivia F.\nKirtley, Karen S. Lynch, Richard P. McKenney,\nYusuf I. Mehdi, John P. Wiehoff and Scott W.\nWine. Andrew Cecere is not independent because\nhe is an executive officer of U.S. Bancorp.\nThe Board had determined that each of Arthur\nD. Collins, Jr., Doreen Woo Ho, David B.\nO'Maley, O'dell M. Owens, M.D., M.P.H and\nCraig D. Schnuck was an independent director\nprior to their retirement from the Board in\nApril 2020.\n\nOur Board has adopted a set of standards in\nour Corporate Governance Guidelines to assist\nit in assessing the independence of each of\nour non-employee directors. A director of U.S.\nBancorp who meets the independence\nqualifications of the New York Stock Exchange\n(the \"NYSE\") listing standards may be deemed\n\"independent\" by the Board of Directors after\nconsideration of the relationships between\nU.S. Bancorp or any of its affiliates and the\ndirector or any of his or her immediate family\nmembers or other related parties. Our Board\ndeems the following relationships to be\ncategorically immaterial such that they will\nnot, by themselves, affect an independence\ndetermination:\n\nThe only relationships between U.S. Bancorp\nand our directors or the directors' related\ninterests that were considered by the Board\nwhen assessing the independence of our non-\nemployee directors are the relationships\nbetween U.S. Bancorp and each of Microsoft\nCorporation, a corporation with which our\ndirector Yusuf I. Mehdi is affiliated, Oracle\nCorporation, a corporation with which our\ndirector Kimberly N. Ellison-Taylor is\naffiliated, and Schnuck Markets, Inc., a\ncorporation with which Craig D. Schnuck, a\nformer director who retired in April 2020, is\naffiliated.\n\nThe Board determined that these relationships,\nwhich are described later in this proxy\nstatement under the heading \"Certain\nRelationships and Related Transactions \u0097\nRelated Person Transactions,\" do not or did\nnot impair Mr. Mehdi's, Ms. Ellison-Taylor's\nor Mr. Schnuck's independence. This\ndetermination was based on the Board's\nconclusion that the amounts involved in\ntransactions between U.S. Bancorp and\nMicrosoft, Oracle or Schnuck Markets, as the\ncase may be, are immaterial to Microsoft's,\nOracle's and Schnuck Markets' gross revenues,\nrespectively, and that the relationships had\nno unique characteristics that could influence\nMr. Mehdi's, Ms. Ellison-Taylor's or Mr.\nSchnuck's impartial judgment as a director of\nU.S. Bancorp.\n                   \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b                 \n  U.S.             \n  Bancorp      \u200b    \n  2021         18  \n  Proxy            \n  Statement        \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                        \n  \u200b                      \n  Corporate governance  \n                        \n                                 \n  Board meetings and committees  \n                                 \nThe Board of Directors conducts its business\nthrough meetings of the Board and the\nfollowing standing committees: Audit, Capital\nPlanning, Compensation and Human Resources,\nGovernance, Public Responsibility, Risk\nManagement, and Executive. The standing\ncommittees report on their deliberations and\nactions at each full Board meeting. Each of\nthe standing committees has the authority to\nengage outside experts, advisers and counsel\nto the extent it considers appropriate to\nassist the committee in its work. Each of the\nstanding committees has adopted and operates\nunder a written charter.\n\nThe independent directors meet in executive\nsession (without the CEO or any other member\nof management present) at the end of each\nregularly scheduled Board meeting and may also\nmeet in executive session at any other time.\nThe Lead Director presides over these\nexecutive sessions. See \"Board Leadership\nStructure.\" During each committee meeting, the\ncommittees have the opportunity to hold\nexecutive sessions without members of\nmanagement present.\n\nThe Board of Directors held eleven meetings\nduring 2020. Each director attended at least\n75% of the total meetings of the Board and\nBoard committees on which he or she served\nduring the year. The average attendance rate\nof all directors at Board and Board committee\nmeetings in 2020 was 99%.\n\nDirectors are expected to attend all meetings\nof shareholders. All directors serving at the\ntime attended the 2020 annual meeting.\n                   \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n        \u200b           \n        U.S.       \n  \u200b      Bancorp    \n  19    2021       \n        Proxy      \n        Statement  \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                        \n  \u200b                      \n  Corporate governance  \n                        \n                                 \n  Board performance evaluations  \n                                 \nOur Governance Committee conducts an annual\nassessment of the Board's performance to\ndetermine whether the Board, its committees\nand its members are functioning effectively\nand to identify areas for growth and\nimprovement. The annual process is as follows:\n\nBased on director feedback received over the\nlast several years through this annual\nevaluation process and through less formal\nchannels, including feedback provided by\ndirectors at meetings, management has adjusted\nthe content and style of its written materials\nand oral presentations for committee meetings.\nIn addition, the Governance Committee has\nreceived information about the skills and\nqualifications that directors would like\nfuture Board or committee members to have.\nDirector feedback has also led to discussion\nof how to appropriately balance oversight\nresponsibility for critical matters affecting\nour company among the Board and its\ncommittees, and how committee action is most\neffectively communicated to the full Board.\n                   \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b                 \n  U.S.             \n  Bancorp      \u200b    \n  2021         20  \n  Proxy            \n  Statement        \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                        \n  \u200b                      \n  Corporate governance  \n                        \n                      \n  Director education  \n                      \nIt is important for our directors to\ncontinually receive additional information and\ntraining that will help them to effectively\noversee the management of our company. We have\nimplemented a robust director education\nprogram that begins with in-depth training\ncovering our industry and each of our lines of\nbusiness, and that continues with special\neducation sessions throughout the year that\nhighlight current business, industry,\nregulatory and governance topics presented by\ninternal and external experts. Directors are\nencouraged to attend continuing training\nsessions offered by outside providers on\ntopics related to general corporate governance\nas well as specialized areas in risk\nmanagement, audit, compensation and other\nmatters, at the company's expense.\n                          \n  Shareholder engagement  \n                          \nWe value the views of our investors and\nwelcome feedback from them. Our standard\nengagement practice is to initiate\nconversations with our largest investors each\nfall. In the fall of 2020, we reached out to\nour top 50 shareholders and invited them to\ntalk to us about corporate governance, our\nCOVD-19 response, executive compensation and\ndisclosure matters, and any other topics they\nwish to discuss. We also consider requests for\nengagement from shareholders outside of the\nfall outreach effort.\n\nManagement shares the feedback received from\nshareholders with the Governance Committee,\nand feedback that relates to matters that are\nspecifically overseen by a different Board\ncommittee are also provided to those\ncommittees. The committees take the views\nexpressed by our shareholders into\nconsideration when making decisions.\nManagement also considers shareholder feedback\nabout disclosure practices when preparing our\ncompany's public filings.\n           \n  Conduct  \n           \nWe are deeply committed to maintaining the\nhighest standards of ethical conduct that\nreflect our purpose and core values. In\nrecognition of that commitment, we were named\none of the World's Most Ethical Companies\u00ae in\n2021 by the Ethisphere Institute.\n\nOur Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, which\nis available on our website at usbank.com by\nclicking on \"About us\", \"Investor relations\",\n\"Corporate Governance\" and then \"Governance\ndocuments\", outlines the responsibilities of\nevery employee and director to our customers,\nour shareholders, our community and each\nother.\n                                   \n  Committee member qualifications  \n                                   \nAll of the Audit Committee members meet the\nindependence and experience requirements of\nthe NYSE and the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \"SEC\"). As part of those\nrequirements, our Board of Directors has\ndetermined that each member of the Audit\nCommittee is financially literate. All of the\nGovernance Committee members and Compensation\nand Human Resources Committee members also\nmeet the independence requirements of the\nNYSE, including, with respect to the\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee\nmembers, the NYSE's independence requirements\nspecific to members of compensation\ncommittees.\n\nThe Audit Committee charter generally\nprohibits Audit Committee members from serving\non more than two other public company audit\ncommittees.

This framework\nincludes company-level and business unit Risk\nAppetite Statements that set boundaries for\nthe types and amount of risk that may be\nundertaken in pursuing business objectives and\ninitiatives.\n\nThe Board of Directors oversees management's\nperformance relative to the Risk Management\nFramework, Risk Appetite Statements, and other\npolicy requirements. While management is\nresponsible for defining the various risks\nfacing our company, formulating risk\nmanagement policies and procedures, and\nmanaging risk exposures on a day-to-day basis,\nthe Board's responsibility is to oversee our\ncompany's risk management processes by\ninforming itself about our material risks and\nevaluating whether management has reasonable\nrisk management and control processes in place\nto address those material risks.\n\nThe Board's risk oversight responsibility is\nprimarily carried out through its standing\ncommittees, as follows:\n\nThe Risk Management, Audit, and Capital\nPlanning Committees meet annually in joint\nsession to give each committee the opportunity\nto review the risk areas primarily overseen by\nthe other, and all Board members attend this\nmeeting to benefit from the discussion.\nFinally, at each meeting of the full Board of\nDirectors, each committee gives a detailed\nreport of the matters it discussed and\nconclusions it reached during its recent\nmeetings.\n                   \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b                 \n  U.S.             \n  Bancorp      \u200b    \n  2021         24  \n  Proxy            \n  Statement        \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                        \n  \u200b                      \n  Corporate governance  \n                        \nFocus on cybersecurity risk\n\nThe Board is very focused on the risks that\ncybersecurity threats pose to our company as a\nmajor financial services institution. The\nBoard has established a comprehensive\noversight framework to address those\nincreasing risks:\n\n\u25b6 a Cybersecurity Oversight Subcommittee of\nthe Risk Management Committee was formed in\nJanuary 2019 to provide dedicated oversight of\nthe following matters: \u0096 our program and\npractices for identifying cybersecurity risks;\n\u0096 our controls to prevent, detect and respond\nto cyber attacks, cyber incidents or\ninformation or data breaches; \u0096 our cyber\nresiliency, including cybersecurity risk\npreparedness, incident response plans, and\nbusiness continuity and disaster recovery\ncapabilities; and \u0096 our investments in\ncybersecurity infrastructure;\n\n\u25b6 the Risk Management Committee receives\nregular reports from management on\ncybersecurity issues and maintains primary\noversight of risks arising from the related\nareas of data privacy and information\nsecurity;\n\n\u25b6 the annual joint session of the Risk\nManagement, Audit, and Capital Planning\nCommittees includes a report from our\ncompany's Chief Information Security Officer\non the cybersecurity threats facing our\ncompany and our company's preparedness to meet\nand respond to those threats; and\n\n\u25b6 the full Board typically holds an annual\ncybersecurity educational session, which\nfeatures the perspective of an outside expert\non a current cybersecurity topic, complemented\nby special presentations from our company's\ninformation security and risk management\nfunctions.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is profoundly affecting\nour customers, our employees and the\ncommunities we serve. At the onset of the\npandemic we activated our crisis management\nplans, which are tested annually under the\noversight of the Board. The Board was highly\nengaged in overseeing management's pandemic\nresponse, and increased its communications and\ninteractions with management as the crisis\ndeveloped and as the company adjusted its\noperations to provide critical financial\nsupport, through both private and government\nprograms, to our communities.\n\nAs the crisis continues to evolve, our\ncustomers rely on us to provide essential\nfinancial services and our employees rely on\nus to provide a safe working environment. The\nBoard has continued to actively monitor\nmanagement's response to this crisis, which\nhas included:\n\nManagement and the Board of Directors will\ncontinue to actively oversee our response and\nthe risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n                   \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n        \u200b           \n        U.S.       \n  \u200b      Bancorp    \n  25    2021       \n        Proxy      \n        Statement  \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                        \n  \u200b                      \n  Corporate governance  \n                        \nManagement-level risk structure underlying\nBoard oversight\n\nEach Board committee carries out its risk\nmanagement responsibilities using reports from\nmanagement containing information relevant to\nthe risk areas under that committee's\noversight. The committees must therefore be\nconfident that an appropriate risk monitoring\nstructure is in place at the management level\nin order to be provided accurate and useful\ninformational reports. The management-level\nrisk oversight structure is robust. Our\ncompany relies on comprehensive risk\nmanagement processes to identify, aggregate\nand measure, manage, and monitor risks. This\nsystem enables the Board of Directors to\nestablish a mutual understanding with\nmanagement of the effectiveness of our\ncompany's risk management practices and\ncapabilities, to review our company's risk\nexposure and to elevate certain key risks for\ndiscussion at the Board level. A framework\nexists to account for the introduction of\nemerging risks or any increase in risks\nroutinely taken, which would either be largely\ncontrolled by the risk limits in place or\nidentified through the frequent risk reporting\nthat occurs throughout our company.\n\nTheExecutive Risk Committee, which is chaired\nby our Chief Risk Officer and which includes\nthe CEO and other members of the executive\nmanagement team, oversees execution against\nthe Risk Management Framework and company-\nlevel Risk Appetite Statement. The Executive\nRisk Committee meets monthly, and more\nfrequently when circumstances merit, to\nprovide executive management oversight of our\nRisk Management Framework, assess appropriate\nlevels of risk exposure and actions that may\nbe required for identified risks to be\nadequately mitigated, promote effective\nmanagement of all risk categories, and foster\nthe establishment and maintenance of an\neffective risk culture. The Executive Risk\nCommittee members manage large, sophisticated\ngroups within our company that are dedicated\nto controlling and monitoring risk to the\nlevels deemed appropriate by the Board of\nDirectors and executive management. These\nindividuals, together with our company's\nController, Treasurer and others, also provide\nthe Board's committees with the information\nthe committees need and request in order to\ncarry out their oversight responsibilities.\n\nThe Executive Risk Committee focuses on\ncurrent and emerging risks, including\nstrategic and reputational risks, directing\ntimely and comprehensive actions. The\nfollowing senior operating committees have\nalso been established to support the work of\nthe Executive Risk Committee, each responsible\nfor overseeing a specified category of risk:\n                                              \n  Asset and Liability Management              \n  Committee                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  Capital Management Operating                \n  Committee                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  Compliance Risk Management                  \n  Committee                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  Conduct Risk Committee                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  Disclosure Committee                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Enterprise IT Governance                    \n  Committee                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  Executive Credit Management Group           \n  Committee                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  Incentive Review Committee                  \n                                              \n                   \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b                 \n  U.S.             \n  Bancorp      \u200b    \n  2021         26  \n  Proxy            \n  Statement        \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                        \n  \u200b                      \n  Corporate governance  \n                        \n                                              \n  Mergers and Acquisitions                    \n  Committee                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  Operational Risk Committee                  \n                                              \n                                              \n  Reputation Risk Oversight                   \n  Committee                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  Strategic Investment                        \n  Committee                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  Trust Management Committee                  \n                                              \nOur Board and management-level committees are\nsupported by a \"three lines of defense\" model\nfor establishing effective checks and\nbalances. The first line of defense, primarily\nthe revenue-generating business lines, manages\nrisks in conformity with established limits\nand policy requirements. In turn, business\nleaders and their risk officers establish\nprograms to ensure conformity with these\nlimits and policy requirements. The second\nline of defense, primarily the Chief Risk\nOfficer's organization, but also including the\npolicy and oversight activities of corporate\nsupport functions, translates risk appetite\nand strategy into actionable risk limits and\npolicies. The second line of defense monitors\nthe first line of defense's compliance with\nlimits and policies, and provides reporting\nand escalation of emerging risks and other\nconcerns to senior management and the Risk\nManagement Committee of the Board of\nDirectors. The third line of defense, internal\naudit, is responsible for providing the Audit\nCommittee and senior management with\nindependent assessment and assurance regarding\nthe effectiveness of our company's governance,\nrisk management and control processes.\n                              \n  Board leadership structure  \n                              \nBoard leadership policies and practices\n\nOur Board believes that a strong, independent\nBoard of Directors is critical to effective\noversight of management. The Board regularly\nand carefully considers the critical issue of\nthe best independent leadership structure for\nthe Board, and maintains a flexible policy\nregarding the issue of whether the position of\nChairman should be held by an independent\ndirector. At least annually, the Board reviews\nthe Board's and company's needs and the\nleadership attributes of its directors and\nexecutives to determine whether our company is\nbest served at that particular time by having\nthe CEO or another director hold the position\nof Chairman.\n\nIn order to provide strong independent Board\nleadership, the independent directors elect a\nLead Director with the substantial leadership\nresponsibilities detailed below when the\nposition of Chairman is not held by an\nindependent director. The Lead Director is\nelected annually upon the recommendation of\nthe Governance Committee, with the expectation\nthat he or she will generally serve three, and\nmay serve up to five, consecutive terms.\n\nIn addition to strong independent leadership\nof the full Board, each of the Audit\nCommittee, Governance Committee, and\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee is\ncomposed solely of independent directors.\nIndependent directors, therefore, oversee\ncritical, risk-sensitive matters such as the\nquality and integrity of our financial\nstatements; the compensation of our executive\nofficers, including the CEO; the nomination of\ndirectors; and the evaluation of the Board,\nits committees, and its members.

The voting standard for directors in\na contested election is a plurality of the\nvotes cast at the meeting.\n\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines provide\nthat director nominees must submit a\ncontingent resignation in writing to the\nGovernance Committee, which becomes effective\nif the director fails to receive a sufficient\nnumber of votes for re-election at the annual\nmeeting of shareholders and the Board accepts\nthe resignation. The Board will nominate for\nelection or re-election as director only\ncandidates who have tendered such a contingent\nresignation.\n\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines further\nprovide that if an incumbent director fails to\nreceive the required vote for re-election, our\nGovernance Committee will act within 90 days\nafter certification of the shareholder vote to\ndetermine whether to accept the director's\nresignation, and will submit a recommendation\nfor prompt consideration by the Board. The\nBoard expects the director whose resignation\nis under consideration to abstain from\nparticipating in any decision regarding his or\nher resignation. The Governance Committee and\nthe Board may consider any factors they deem\nrelevant in deciding whether to accept a\ndirector's resignation.\n\nIf each member of the Governance Committee\nfails to receive the required vote in favor of\nhis or her election in the same election, then\nthose independent directors who did receive\nthe required vote will appoint a committee\namongst themselves to consider the\nresignations and recommend to the Board\nwhether to accept them. However, if the only\ndirectors who received the required vote in\nthe same election constitute three or fewer\ndirectors, all directors may participate in\nthe decision regarding whether to accept the\nresignations.\n\nEach director nominee named in this proxy\nstatement has tendered an irrevocable,\ncontingent resignation as a director in\naccordance with our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines, which resignation will become\neffective if he or she fails to receive the\nrequired vote for election at the annual\nmeeting and the Board accepts his or her\nresignation.\n                                              \n  Succession planning and management          \n  development                                 \n                                              \nA primary responsibility of the Board is\nplanning for CEO succession, as well as\noverseeing succession planning for other\nsenior management positions. The Board's\nprocess targets the building of enhanced\nmanagement depth and skills, considers\ncontinuity and stability within our company,\nand responds to our company's evolving needs\nand changing circumstances. To achieve these\ngoals, the executive talent development and\nsuccession planning process is integrated into\nthe Board's annual activities.\n\nThe Board works with the Governance Committee\nto evaluate a number of potential internal and\nexternal candidates as successors to the CEO,\nand considers emergency, temporary scenarios\nas well as long-term succession. The CEO makes\navailable to the Board his or her\nrecommendations and evaluations of potential\nsuccessors, along with a review of any\ndevelopment plans recommended for those\nindividuals. The Compensation and Human\nResources Committee is responsible for\nreviewing succession planning for executive\nofficer positions other than the CEO.\n                   \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n        \u200b           \n        U.S.       \n  \u200b      Bancorp    \n  29    2021       \n        Proxy      \n        Statement  \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  \u200b                                            \n  Certain relationships and related           \n  transactions                                \n                                              \nCertain relationships and related transactions\n                                         \n  Review of related person transactions  \n                                         \nThe Board has adopted a written Related Person\nTransactions Policy for the review, evaluation\nand approval or ratification of transactions\nbetween our company and its related persons.\n\"Related persons\" under this policy include\nour directors, director nominees, executive\nofficers, holders of more than 5% of our\ncommon stock, and their respective immediate\nfamily members. \"Immediate family members\"\ninclude children, stepchildren, parents,\nstepparents, spouses, siblings, mothers- and\nfathers-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law,\nbrothers- and sisters-in-law, and any person\n(other than a tenant or employee) sharing the\nperson's household.\n\nExcept as described below, the policy requires\nthe Governance Committee of the Board to\nreview and evaluate and either approve or\ndisapprove all transactions or series of\ntransactions in which:\n\nThe Board has determined that the Governance\nCommittee does not need to review or approve\ncertain transactions even if the amount\ninvolved will exceed $120,000, including the\nfollowing transactions:\n\nWhen considering whether to approve or ratify\na transaction, the Governance Committee will\nconsider facts and circumstances that it deems\nrelevant to its determination, including:\n\nNo director is allowed to participate in the\ndeliberations or vote on the approval or\nratification of a transaction if that director\nis a related person with respect to the\ntransaction under review.

Any\nadjustments applied to the performance metric\ncalculations were made in accordance with the\nterms of the awards, which had been\nestablished before COVID-19 became a pandemic,\nand are described in detail in this\n\"Compensation Discussion and Analysis\"\nsection. \u25b6 Payouts for NEOs' 2020 annual cash\nincentive awards ranged from 61.2% to 87.6% of\ntheir respective target amounts, based on\nearnings per share (\"EPS\") and business line\npretax income results for the year. \u25b6 The\nperformance-based restricted stock units\n(\"PRSUs\") granted in 2018 were earned at\n120.5% of the NEOs' respective target amounts,\nbased on absolute and relative return on\nequity (\"ROE\") results for 2018-2020.\n                                   \n  Corporate financial performance  \n                                   \nIn 2020 our company once again demonstrated\nstrong performance relative to its financial\npeer group in the most commonly used\nperformance metrics for the banking industry.\n                   \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n        \u200b           \n        U.S.       \n  \u200b      Bancorp    \n  33    2021       \n        Proxy      \n        Statement  \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                                        \n  \u200b                                      \n  Compensation discussion and analysis  \n                                        \n                                         \n  Elements of total direct compensation  \n                                         \n                                \n  Sound compensation practices  \n                                \nOur executive compensation program\nincorporates many strong governance features,\nincluding the following:\n                                              \n  What we do                                  \n              Significant majority of each    \n              executive officer's             \n              compensation is at risk         \n              We may cancel unvested equity   \n              awards and reduce cash          \n              incentive compensation for      \n              executives who demonstrate      \n              inadequate sensitivity to risk  \n              We have a clawback policy that  \n              allows us to recoup annual      \n              cash incentive payouts          \n              attributable to incorrectly     \n              reported earnings               \n              We have meaningful stock        \n              ownership and                   \n              hold-until-retirement           \n              requirements                    \n              The Committee retains an        \n              independent compensation        \n              consultant that provides no     \n              other services to our company   \n                                              \n                                              \n  What we don't do                            \n                    Our executive officers    \n                    do not have employment    \n                    or change-in-control      \n                    agreements                \n                    We do not allow           \n                    executive officers to     \n                    hedge or pledge their     \n                    company stock             \n                    We do not have            \n                    single-trigger            \n                    accelerated vesting of    \n                    equity awards upon a      \n                    change-in-control of the  \n                    company                   \n                    We do not provide tax     \n                    gross-ups (except in      \n                    relation to relocation    \n                    expenses)                 \n                    We do not pay dividends   \n                    on any PRSUs that are     \n                    not earned through        \n                    satisfaction of the       \n                    awards' performance       \n                    metrics;

The Committee achieves this\nobjective through a compensation program that:\n\nPay for performance\n\nU.S. Bancorp operates in a highly complex\nbusiness environment, where it competes with\nmany well-established financial institutions\nand, increasingly, with non-banks offering\nproducts and services that traditionally were\noffered only by banks. Our long-term business\nobjective is to maximize shareholder value by\nconsistently delivering superior returns on\ncommon equity that exceed the cost of equity.\nIf we are successful in achieving this\nobjective, the Committee believes the results\nwill benefit our shareholders.\n\nAccordingly, our executive compensation\nprogram is designed to reward our executives\nfor achieving annual and long-term financial\nresults that further our long-term business\nobjectives. The annual cash incentive plan\nrewards performance relative to corporate EPS\nand business line pretax income targets\nestablished at the beginning of the fiscal\nyear, and the PRSUs are earned based on\nachievement of ROE targets over a three-year\nperiod that directly measure the return\ngenerated by the company on its shareholders'\ninvestment. The ultimate value of both the\nPRSUs and RSUs is dependent on our long-term\nfinancial success as reflected in the price of\nU.S. Bancorp stock.\n\nAt the same time, the Committee carefully\nweighs the risks inherent in these programs\nagainst the goals of the programs and the\ncompany's risk appetite. Additional discussion\nof the risk oversight undertaken by the\nCommittee can be found below under \"Decision\nMaking and Policies \u0097 Risk Considerations.\"\n\nPay levels\n\nWhen determining executive compensation levels\neach year, the Committee considers the value\nof each compensation element as well as the\nvalue of the total direct compensation\npackage. Key factors that inform pay levels\ninclude the following:\n                   \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n        \u200b           \n        U.S.       \n  \u200b      Bancorp    \n  35    2021       \n        Proxy      \n        Statement  \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                                        \n  \u200b                                      \n  Compensation discussion and analysis  \n                                        \nCompensation elements\n\nOur NEOs' total direct compensation consists\nof three elements: base salary, annual cash\nincentive compensation, and long-term\nincentive compensation (60% of which is\ndelivered in PRSUs and 40% in RSUs). Each of\nthese elements of total direct compensation is\ndescribed in detail below.\n\nNEOs are also eligible to receive health\nbenefits under the same plans available to our\nother employees, matching contributions to\ntheir U.S. Bank 401(k) Savings Plan accounts\non the same basis as our other employees, and\nretirement benefits that are earned over their\ncareer with the company. No NEO has an\nemployment or standalone change-in-control\nagreement. NEOs do not receive gross-up\npayments for tax liabilities resulting from\nperquisites, except in relation to relocation\nexpenses.\n               \n  Base salary  \n               \nBase salary is the only component of the NEO's\ntotal direct compensation not at risk. The\nCommittee considers the salary of executive\nofficers relative to comparable executives in\nour compensation peer group and will make\nmarket-based adjustments as it deems\nappropriate. Salaries can also be adjusted to\nreflect experience and tenure in a position,\ninternal pay equity within the executive\nofficer group, promotions or increased scope\nof responsibilities, individual performance,\nand retention considerations.\n\n2020 salary actions:The Committee made no\nchanges to Mr. Cecere's salary for 2020.

Both\nthe EPS and business line pretax income\nresults are assessed relative to targets\nincluded in our company's annual financial\nplan. The Board establishes these financial\ntargets at the beginning of the fiscal year\nwith the intent that they are challenging yet\nachievable goals.\n\nFor executives with leadership\nresponsibilities for the entire company,\nincluding Messrs. Cecere and Dolan, or for a\ncorporate-wide support function, including Mr.\nvon Gillern, the Business Line Result is based\non the weighted average of the pretax income\nresults of all the company's business lines.\nFor executives who lead a revenue-producing\ngroup, including Mr. Welsh and Ms. Kedia, the\nBusiness Line Result is based on the weighted\naverage pretax income results of the business\nlines within the group he or she leads.\n\nFor purposes of computing the Bonus Funding\nPercentage, we adjust EPS results to remove\nthe impact of any variation in our loan loss\nreserve build or release on an after-tax\nbasis, while including net charge-offs to\ncapture actual credit losses experienced. The\nCommittee established this approach at the\nbeginning of 2020 in connection with our\nadoption of the Current Expected Credit Losses\n(\"CECL\") accounting standard in January 2020,\nwhich created significant potential accounting\nvolatility and uncertainty with our loan loss\nreserve that would be dependent upon a number\nof judgmental factors and economic\nassumptions.\n\nFor business line pretax income, the results\ninclude a component for changes in the loan\nloss reserve driven by loan balances and\nchanges in loan portfolio credit quality. The\nCommittee adjusts the results, however, so\nthat the effect of any variation in our loan\nloss reserve build or release driven by\nchanges in loan portfolio credit quality is\nreduced by 50% to align bonus funding with\nchanges in credit quality while reducing some\nof the volatility caused by judgmental\nfactors. In previous years, before we had\nadopted CECL, we had made the 50% modification\nfor both EPS and business line pretax income\nresults.\n\nThese adjustments for loan loss reserve\nvariation maintain accountability for credit\nquality and are applied consistently whether\nthe adjustment is positive or negative. The\nCommittee will also consider in any year\nwhether EPS should be further adjusted from\nreported amounts to normalize any notable\nitems and whether other normalizing\nadjustments should be made to business line\npretax income results.\n                   \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n        \u200b           \n        U.S.       \n  \u200b      Bancorp    \n  37    2021       \n        Proxy      \n        Statement  \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                                        \n  \u200b                                      \n  Compensation discussion and analysis  \n                                        \nThe Committee believes that EPS and business\nline pretax income are appropriate performance\nmetrics for the executive officers' annual\ncash incentive awards for the following\nreasons:\n\nThe Bonus Funding Percentage for each business\nline is calculated as follows:\n\n2020 Corporate Result:The Corporate Result\nwas58.7%, which was calculated as follows:\n\n2020 Business Line Results:Pretax income\nresults, inclusive of the regular adjustments\ndescribed above, ranged from 40.6% to 224.6%\nof target performance across our company's 23\nrevenue-producing business lines.

The\nCommittee also uses a formal \"risk scorecard\"\nassessment, which can result in downward or\nupward adjustments to the Bonus Funding\nPercentage to reflect the executives'\ndemonstrated sensitivity to risk.\n\nThe Committee believes that it is important to\nretain the ability to recognize outstanding\nindividual performance and risk mitigation in\ndetermining Annual Cash Incentive Payouts, as\nwell as to acknowledge circumstances where\nindividual performance improvements are\nsuggested or where inappropriate risk-taking\nbehaviors have occurred. Modifications to our\nNEOs' Bonus Funding Percentage based on their\nindividual performance and risk sensitivity\nhave been used only occasionally, however, and\nhave historically been modest in scope. During\nthe five-year period preceding 2020, NEOs\ncollectively received increases two times and\ndecreases two times, resulting in\nmodifications ranging from \u00965% to +10%.\n\n2020 individual performance and risk\nsensitivity actions:The Committee increased\nthe Bonus Funding Percentage applicable to Ms.\nKedia's Target Award Amount by 5% to recognize\nher significant leadership outside her normal\nresponsibilities in supporting the company's\nparticipation in the CARES Act's Paycheck\nProtection Program in 2020. The Committee did\nnot make any other modifications for\nindividual performance. Following an analysis\nof the NEOs' risk scorecard results, the\nCommittee did not make any risk-based\nmodifications to the NEOs' Bonus Funding\nPercentages.\n\n2020 Annual Cash Incentive Payout results:The\nresulting payouts made to the NEOs in March\n2021 for 2020 performance under the AEIP were\nas follows:\n                   \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n        \u200b           \n        U.S.       \n  \u200b      Bancorp    \n  39    2021       \n        Proxy      \n        Statement  \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                                        \n  \u200b                                      \n  Compensation discussion and analysis  \n                                        \n                              \n  Long-term incentive awards  \n                              \nEstablishing the structure of the equity\nawards\n\nLong-term, stock-based compensation represents\nthe most significant portion of our NEOs'\ntotal compensation package. In 2020, 67% of\nour CEO's target total direct compensation and\n60% of our other NEOs' target total direct\ncompensation (on average) consisted of equity\nawards. The Committee uses equity awards to\nalign the NEOs' interests with those of long-\nterm shareholders.\n\nThe Committee grants equity awards to\nexecutive officers under the U.S. Bancorp 2015\nStock Incentive Plan. In 2020, 60% of the\nvalue of each executive officer's long-term\nincentive award was granted in the form of\nPRSUs that will cliff vest (if earned) on the\nthird anniversary of the grant date, following\na three-year performance period, and 40% was\ngranted in the form of RSUs that will vest\nratably over three years. Cash dividends on\nunvested PRSUs are accrued during the\nperformance period but are only paid at\nvesting on shares earned, if any, by the\nexecutives.\n\nThe mix of performance-based and time-based\nequity vehicles, with the mix more heavily\nweighted toward performance-based equity, is\ndesigned to motivate achievement of financial\nobjectives while encouraging retention and\nstock ownership.\n\nSetting the value of the equity awards\n\nEach year in January, the Committee determines\nthe dollar value of the long-term incentive\nawards to be granted to the executive\nofficers, and the grants are made on a pre-\ndetermined date in February or March. In\nsetting each year's award amounts, the\nCommittee considers the relative market\nposition of the awards and the total\ncompensation for each executive, the\nproportion of each executive's total direct\ncompensation to be delivered as a long-term\nincentive award, internal pay equity,\nexecutive performance and changes in\nresponsibility, retention considerations, and\ncorporate performance.\n\n2020 equity value actions: The Committee\nincreased the value of the long-term incentive\nawards granted to the NEOs in 2020 to reward\nstrong performance during 2019 and to align\nthose NEOs' total compensation more closely\nwith the opportunities available to executives\nin similar roles at companies in our peer\ngroup.\n                                              \n           Val\u2026              Va\u2026              \n           of                of               \n           equ\u2026              eq\u2026              \n           awa\u2026              aw\u2026              \n           gra\u2026              gr\u2026              \n           in                in               \n  NEO      2019              20\u2026              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  An\u2026      $     8,1\u2026        $    8,6\u2026        \n  Ce\u2026                                         \n  \u200b         \u200b                  \u200b                 \n  Te\u2026                                         \n  R.       $     3,5\u2026        $    3,6\u2026        \n  Do\u2026                                         \n  \u200b         \u200b                  \u200b                 \n  Je\u2026                                         \n  H.       $     2,5\u2026        $    2,7\u2026        \n  von                                         \n  Gi\u2026                                         \n  \u200b         \u200b                  \u200b                 \n  Ti\u2026                                         \n  A.       $     2,1\u2026        $    2,3\u2026        \n  We\u2026                                         \n  \u200b         \u200b                  \u200b                 \n  Gu\u2026      $     2,1\u2026        $    2,3\u2026        \n  Ke\u2026                                         \n  \u200b         \u200b                  \u200b                 \n                                              \nSelecting the performance metrics for the PRSU\nawards\n\nThe number of PRSUs earned is determined\naccording to a formula that uses a comparison\nof our actual ROE result to target-level ROE,\nas well as our ROE performance relative to\nthat of our peer financial institutions. ROE\nis used as the performance metric because:\n                   \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b                 \n  U.S.             \n  Bancorp      \u200b    \n  2021         40  \n  Proxy            \n  Statement        \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                                        \n  \u200b                                      \n  Compensation discussion and analysis  \n                                        \nThe Committee uses a performance matrix,\nillustrated below, that reflects both absolute\nand relative ROE scales to determine the final\nPRSU award amounts earned during the\nperformance period. Target levels of both\nabsolute and relative ROE are established,\nwith maximum and minimum levels also\nidentified. Earn-out amounts are determined\nusing interpolation.\n\nThe Committee believes that the PRSU earn-out\nstructure provides an important balance\nbetween rewarding the achievement of absolute\nperformance goals and strong relative\nperformance. Executives are not rewarded for\npoor performance simply because members of our\nfinancial peer group have even worse\nperformance, nor are they rewarded for\nexceeding expectations if performance relative\nto peers is substandard. In addition, by using\na sliding scale for each ROE performance\nmetric, the matrix takes into account the\namount of variance from the ROE target and\npeer group ROE results, rewarding performance\nwhile mitigating the incentive for excessive\nrisk taking that may result from an \"all-or-\nnothing\" award.\n\nSetting the levels of absolute and relative\nROE for the PRSU performance matrix\n\nThe target and maximum ROE levels selected by\nthe Committee for the three-year performance\nperiod contained in the PRSU awards granted\neach year are based on the ROE range included\nin the company's profitability goals announced\nat the last Investor Day conference held\nbefore the grant or changes to profitability\ngoals that are publicly communicated prior to\nthe grant date. ROE may be adjusted from\nreported results to normalize the effect of\nsignificant notable items, e.g. merger-related\nchanges in the event there were an acquisition\nintegration occuring. Beginning in 2020, ROE\nresults include adjustments related to the\nimpacts of the CECL accounting standard. The\nadjustments eliminate the volatility of the\naccounting standard related to changes in the\nallowance for credit losses, while including\nnet charge-offs related to actual credit\nlosses experienced. These CECL-related\nadjustments to the ROE calculation for the\nPRSU awards were adopted by the Committee in\nJanuary 2020, when we adopted the accounting\nstandard, and before COVID-19 became a\npandemic.\n\nThe Committee also establishes a sliding scale\nof ROE achieved relative to the ROE of our\nfinancial peer group, which consists of the\nfollowing institutions: Bank of America,\nCitizens, Fifth Third, J.P. Morgan, KeyCorp,\nPNC, Regions, Truist Financial, and Wells\nFargo. This group is used by the company for\nfinancial comparison purposes because these\ncompanies, along with U.S. Bancorp, are the\nlargest financial services companies based in\nthe United States that provide broadly\ncomparable retail and commercial banking\nservices. The ROE performance matrix provides\nthat performance above the median of peers\nwill increase the payout otherwise earned\nbased on our absolute ROE result, while\nperformance below the median of peers will\nreduce the award payout.\n\nThe company's absolute and relative ROE\nresults for each of the three years within the\nperformance period are applied to the\nperformance matrix to produce a percentage of\ntarget PRSUs result for that year. At the end\nof the performance period, the percentage\nresults for the three years will be averaged\nto determine the percentage of target PRSUs\nearned and eligible to vest upon the third\nanniversary of the grant date.\n\nResults of PRSUs earned 2018-2020:In February\n2018, PRSUs were granted for the 2018-2020\nperformance period using the following ROE\nperformance matrix:\n                   \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n        \u200b           \n        U.S.       \n  \u200b      Bancorp    \n  41    2021       \n        Proxy      \n        Statement  \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                                        \n  \u200b                                      \n  Compensation discussion and analysis  \n                                        \nThe absolute and relative ROE performance\nduring the three-year period was as follows:\n                                              \n        \u200b  \u200b        \u200b          \u200b          \u200b        \n                            P\u2026        E\u2026      \n      Y\u2026          R\u2026        g\u2026        o\u2026      \n                            r\u2026        p\u2026      \n        \u200b  \u200b        \u200b          \u200b          \u200b        \n                            At                \n                            or                \n      2\u2026          1\u2026        a\u2026        1\u2026      \n                            7\u2026                \n                            %\u2026                \n        \u200b  \u200b        \u200b          \u200b          \u200b        \n                            At                \n                            or                \n      2\u2026          1\u2026        a\u2026        1\u2026      \n                            7\u2026                \n                            %\u2026                \n        \u200b  \u200b        \u200b          \u200b          \u200b        \n                            At                \n                            or                \n      2\u2026          1\u2026        a\u2026        1\u2026      \n                            7\u2026                \n                            %\u2026                \n        \u200b  \u200b        \u200b          \u200b          \u200b        \n          F\u2026                                  \n          e\u2026                                  \n          o\u2026                                  \n          p\u2026                                  \n          f\u2026                          1\u2026      \n          P\u2026                                  \n          a\u2026                                  \n          g\u2026                                  \n          in                                  \n          2\u2026                                  \n        \u200b  \u200b        \u200b          \u200b          \u200b        \n                                              \n1. 2018 and 2019 ROE results are as reported, \nand 2020 ROE results include adjustments      \nrelated to the impacts of the CECL accounting \nstandard as described above.

Committee selects companies for the\ncompensation peer group that it believes\nrepresent our most meaningful competitors in\nthe marketplace for executive talent. The\nCommittee also reviews and uses compensation\ndata from a large group of diversified\nfinancial services companies as an additional\npoint of comparison. As a result of this\nongoing analysis and resulting compensation\nadjustments, our executive compensation\npositioning is generally within market range,\nrecognizing that several positions are unique\nto our company and do not have clear market\ncomparisons.\n\nStock ownership and retention requirements\n\nThe Committee believes that ownership of our\ncommon stock by our executive officers\ndirectly aligns their interests with those of\nour other shareholders and helps balance the\nincentives for risk taking inherent in equity-\nbased awards. We require our executives to\nhold significant amounts of company stock. We\nalso require that they retain until retirement\na substantial portion of their vested stock\nawards (net of shares withheld to satisfy tax\nobligations), even after minimum ownership\nlevels have been met. The current ownership\nand retention requirements are as follows:\n\nVested PRSUs, all RSUs and stock received and\nheld after exercise of stock options are\nincluded in determining whether an executive\nofficer satisfies his or her applicable\nminimum ownership level. As of December 31,\n2020, all our executive officers were in\ncompliance with the stock ownership and\nretention requirements except for one, whose\nholdings fell slightly below the applicable\nminimum level due to the reduced price of our\nstock.\n                   \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b                 \n  U.S.             \n  Bancorp      \u200b    \n  2021         44  \n  Proxy            \n  Statement        \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                                        \n  \u200b                                      \n  Compensation discussion and analysis  \n                                        \nClawback and forfeiture provisions applicable\nto executive awards\n\nChange-in-control provisions for executive\nofficers\n\nHedging and pledging policy\n\nThe company's Insider Trading Policy prohibits\nexecutive officers and directors of the\ncompany from hedging shares of the company's\ncommon stock, including, but not limited to,\nengaging in short sales or trading in puts,\ncalls, covered calls or other derivative\nproducts. The policy also prohibits executive\nofficers and directors from pledging shares of\nthe company's common stock as collateral for a\nloan.\n\nRisk considerations\n\nOverview:Prudent risk taking is an integral\npart of any business strategy, and our\ncompensation program is not intended to\nencourage management decisions that completely\neliminate risk. Rather, the combination of\nvarious elements in our program is designed to\nencourage appropriate sensitivity to risk and\nmitigate the potential to reward risk taking\nthat may produce short-term results that\nappear in isolation to be favorable, but that\nmay undermine the successful execution of our\nlong-term business strategy and negatively\naffect shareholder value. Our compensation\npractices are also designed to reward\nperformance while maintaining our core\ncommitment to customer service and ethical\nprinciples. Together with the company's\nprocesses for strategic planning, its internal\ncontrol over financial reporting and other\nfinancial and compliance policies and\npractices, the design of our compensation\nprogram helps to discourage management actions\nthat demonstrate insensitivity to risk.\n\nRole of management:As a large financial\nservices company, we have been subject to a\ncontinuing horizontal industry review of\nincentive compensation policies and practices\nundertaken by the Federal Reserve Board. We\nroutinely undertake a thorough risk analysis\nof every incentive compensation plan of the\ncompany, the individuals covered by each plan\nand the risks inherent in each plan's design\nand implementation. We also conduct validation\nand back-testing activities to ensure that\ncompensation plans are correctly risk rated,\nthe plans are designed to adequately mitigate\nrisk inherent therein, and the plans are\nadministered effectively. The Incentive Review\nCommittee was created to oversee that review\nand to provide more comprehensive oversight of\nthe relationship between the various kinds of\nrisk we manage and our company's incentive\ncompensation plans and programs. The Incentive\nReview Committee meets throughout the year and\nreviews and approves all company incentive\nplans.\n\nThe Incentive Review Committee reviews\nincentive plan elements such as risk controls,\nplan participants, performance measures,\nperformance and payout curves or formulas, how\ntarget level performance is determined\n(including whether any thresholds and caps\nexist), how frequently payouts occur, and the\nmix of fixed and variable compensation that\nthe plan delivers. The plans and programs are\nalso reviewed from the standpoint of\nreasonableness (for example, how target pay\nlevels compare to similar plans for similar\nemployee groups at other companies, and how\npayout amounts relate to the results that\ngenerate the payments), how well the plans and\nprograms are aligned with the company's goals\nand objectives and with its risk appetite, and\nfrom an overall standpoint, whether these\nplans and programs represent an appropriate\nmix of short-term and long-term compensation.\n                   \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n        \u200b           \n        U.S.       \n  \u200b      Bancorp    \n  45    2021       \n        Proxy      \n        Statement  \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                                        \n  \u200b                                      \n  Compensation discussion and analysis  \n                                        \nAs part of this review by the Incentive Review\nCommittee, our management team, including\nsenior risk officers and individuals from the\ncompensation department, have identified the\nrisks inherent in these programs and have\nmodified plans and controls where appropriate\nto mitigate certain potential risks. For\nexample, most business line incentive\ncompensation plans with a credit component\ntrack early defaults, or defaults that occur\nwithin the first 12 months, and must include a\nprovision that allows the company to offset\nfuture payments by the amount of the\npreviously paid incentives related to the\nearly default.\n\nIn addition, a \"risk scorecard\" assessment\nmeasuring adequacy of risk management is\nundertaken for senior management-level\nemployees who have the individual ability to\npose material risk to the company, including\nthe executive officers; all employees who have\ncredit responsibility and who participate in\nannual corporate cash incentive plans; and all\nemployees who, as part of a group, can engage\nin risk-taking behavior that could be material\nto the company and who participate in annual\ncorporate cash incentive plans. This analysis\nserves as the basis for annual cash incentive\nplan adjustments for these employees.\nAnnually, the Incentive Review Committee also\naddresses risk events that pose a material\nadverse impact to the company or business line\nto determine whether an event should trigger\ncancellation of equity awards. The Incentive\nReview Committee has reviewed its process with\nthe Compensation and Human Resources Committee\nand discussed the areas where compensation-\nrelated risks were being addressed by plan\nmodifications, or were mitigated by internal\ncontrols or otherwise.\n\nRole of the Board:The Compensation and Human\nResources Committee also conducts an annual\nreview of the compensation packages and\ncomponents for the executive officers. The\nCommittee assesses the incentives for risk\ntaking contained in the compensation program\nand balances them with the other goals of the\ncompensation program. In evaluating the\nincentives for risk taking in compensation\nplans and policies for executive officers, the\nCommittee considered the following risk-\nmitigating aspects of those plans and\npolicies:\n                                              \n  Overall executive compensation program      \n  risk                                        \n  mitigation factors                          \n  \u25b6 Long-term incentive focus: The majority   \n  of the total compensation received by       \n  executive officers is in the form of        \n  equity awards with multi-year vesting       \n  schedules, which helps to ensure that       \n  executives have significant value tied to   \n  long-term stock price performance and       \n  mitigates incentives to manage the company  \n  with an excessive focus on short-term       \n  gain.                                       \n  Annual cash incentive risk mitigation       \n  factors                                     \n  \u25b6 Specific risk sensitivity analysis: A     \n  \"risk scorecard\" assessment is performed    \n  for executive officers and can result       \n  in adjustments to award payouts under the   \n  AEIP.                                       \n  \u25b6 Clawback policy: The company's incentive  \n  compensation clawback policy discourages    \n  risk taking that would lead to              \n  improper financial reporting.               \n  \u25b6 Cap on award value: The maximum annual    \n  cash incentive award payable to an          \n  executive officer is equal to 200% of that  \n  officer's target award value, which limits  \n  the potential incentive to take excessive   \n  risk to maximize award value.               \n  Long-term incentive risk mitigation         \n  factors                                     \n  \u25b6 Equity cancellation provisions:           \n  Executive officers' unvested equity awards  \n  can be cancelled if their conduct has       \n  subjected the company to significant        \n  financial, reputational or other risk.      \n  \u25b6 Choice of performance metric: The PRSUs   \n  use ROE as the measure of corporate         \n  performance for determining the final       \n  number of units earned under the award.     \n  Achieving a high ROE requires an            \n  appropriate balance between achieving the   \n  highest return on invested capital and      \n  managing risk within the company's          \n  established risk tolerance levels.          \n  \u25b6 Maximum PRSU payout limited: The number   \n  of units that may be earned under the       \n  performance formula is capped at 150%,      \n  which limits the potential incentive to     \n  take excessive risk to maximize award       \n  value.                                      \n  \u25b6 Sliding scale earn-out calculation: The   \n  PRSU performance matrix takes into account  \n  the amount of variance from the ROE         \n  target and peer group ROE results,          \n  mitigating the incentive for excessive      \n  risk taking that may result from an         \n  \"all-or-nothing\" award.                     \n  \u25b6 Meaningful stock ownership and retention  \n  requirements: Executives are required to    \n  hold significant amounts of company         \n  stock, a portion of which must be held      \n  until retirement, which fosters the         \n  alignment of executives' interests with     \n  those of our long-term shareholders.        \n  \u25b6 Policy prohibiting hedging of shares:     \n  Our executives are prohibited from taking   \n  actions designed to hedge or offset         \n  any decrease in the market value of our     \n  common stock.                               \n                                              \n                   \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b                 \n  U.S.             \n  Bancorp      \u200b    \n  2021         46  \n  Proxy            \n  Statement        \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                                        \n  \u200b                                      \n  Compensation discussion and analysis  \n                                        \nBased on a consideration of the foregoing\nreviews and factors, the Committee has\ndetermined that risks arising from the\ncompany's compensation policies and practices\nfor its employees are not reasonably likely to\nhave a material adverse effect on the company.\n\nCompensation committee report\n\nThe Compensation and Human Resources Committee\nhas reviewed and discussed the Compensation\nDiscussion and Analysis with management.

The U.S.\nBank Legacy Pension Plan was established\neffective January 1, 2020, to receive a\ntransfer from the U.S. Bank Pension Plan of\nthe accrued benefits of participants who\nterminated employment prior to January 1,\n2020. The U.S. Bank Legacy Pension Plan and\nthe U.S. Bank Pension Plan have substantively\nidentical terms. If an employee whose pension\nwas transferred to the U.S. Bank Legacy\nPension Plan is rehired, the employee will\nparticipate in the U.S. Bank Legacy Pension\nPlan on the same terms as the employee would\nhave participated in the U.S. Bank Pension\nPlan prior to the spinoff. Employees may only\nparticipate in the U.S. Bank Pension Plan or\nthe U.S. Bank Legacy Pension Plan \u0097 under no\ncircumstance may an employee participate in\nboth plans.\n\nBecause the U.S. Bank Legacy Pension Plan\nreceived accrued benefits transferred from the\nU.S. Bank Pension Plan, the history of the\nU.S. Bank Pension Plan is relevant to both\nplans. The U.S. Bank Pension Plan was created\nthrough the merger of the former U.S.\nBancorp's career average pay defined benefit\nplan, known as the \"U.S. Bancorp Cash Balance\nPension Plan,\" and the former Firstar\nCorporation's non-contributory defined benefit\nplan, which was primarily a final average pay\nplan. On July 3, 2008, the U.S. Bank Pension\nPlan was frozen to new hires and on November\n15, 2009, the U.S. Bank Pension Plan was\nfrozen to rehires. Employees who were hired\nprior to July 3, 2008, or rehired prior to\nNovember 15, 2009, could elect to continue to\naccrue benefits under the final average pay\nformula of the U.S. Bank Pension Plan, or\ncould elect to accrue benefits under the cash\nbalance portion of the U.S. Bank Pension Plan\nknown as the U.S. Bank 2010 Cash Balance Plan.\nIf no election was made, those employees\ndefaulted into the U.S. Bank 2010 Cash Balance\nPlan. For employees who elected to accrue\nbenefits under the final average pay formula,\nbenefits are calculated using a final average\npay formula, based upon the employee's years\nof service and average salary during the five\nconsecutive years of service in which\ncompensation was the highest during the ten\nyears prior to retirement, with a normal\nretirement age of 65.\n\nEffective January 1, 2010, our company\nestablished a new cash balance formula for\ncertain current and all future eligible\nemployees known as the U.S. Bank 2010 Cash\nBalance Plan. Under the cash balance formula,\nparticipants receive annual pay credits based\non eligible pay multiplied by a percentage\ndetermined by their age and years of service.\nParticipants also receive an annual interest\ncredit. Participants in the pension plan that\nelected to receive pension benefits using the\ncash balance formula or defaulted into the\ncash balance formula had their existing\nbenefits in the pension plan frozen and earn\nfuture benefits under the cash balance\nformula.\n                   \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n        \u200b           \n        U.S.       \n  \u200b      Bancorp    \n  53    2021       \n        Proxy      \n        Statement  \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                          \n  \u200b                        \n  Executive compensation  \n                          \nSubstantially all employees are eligible to\nreceive benefits under the U.S. Bank Pension\nPlan or the U.S. Bank Legacy Pension Plan, as\napplicable. Participation requires one year of\nservice with U.S. Bancorp or its affiliates,\nand vesting of benefits requires five years of\nservice for benefits under the final average\npay formula and three years of service for\nbenefits under the post-2009 cash balance\nformula (and certain legacy plans). Mr. Dolan\nis the only NEO (of those eligible at the\ntime) who elected to remain covered by the\nfinal average pay formula; all other NEOs are\ncovered by the cash balance formula.\n\nAlthough no new benefits are accrued under the\nformer U.S. Bancorp Cash Balance Pension Plan\nformula and Firstar Corporation's plan formula\nfor service after 2001, benefits previously\nearned under those plans have been preserved\nand will be part of a retiree's total\nretirement benefit. In order to preserve the\nrelative value of benefits that use the final\naverage pay formula, subsequent changes in\ncompensation (but not in service) may increase\nthe amount of those benefits.\n\nFederal laws limit the amount of compensation\nwe may consider when determining benefits\npayable under qualified defined benefit\npension plans. We also maintain a non-\ncontributory, non-qualified retirement plan\n(the U.S. Bank Non-Qualified Retirement Plan)\nthat pays the excess pension benefits that\nwould have been payable under our current and\nprior qualified defined benefit pension plans\nif the federal limits were not in effect.\n\nMessrs. Cecere, Dolan and von Gillern earned\nbenefits under the former U.S. Bancorp Cash\nBalance Pension Plan that will be included in\ntheir ultimate retirement benefits.\n\nAs part of her compensation package agreed to\nat hire, Ms. Kedia receives an additional 23\nyears of service when calculating her pay\ncredits in the non-qualified plan. The\nadditional years of service represent her\nservice with her prior employer.\n\nSupplemental retirement benefits\n\nMessrs. Cecere, Dolan and von Gillern are\neligible for a supplemental benefit, which is\nalso paid under the U.S. Bank Non-Qualified\nRetirement Plan, that augments benefits earned\nunder the U.S. Bank Pension Plan and the non-\nqualified excess benefits discussed above. The\nsupplemental benefit ensures that eligible\nexecutives receive a total retirement benefit\nequal to a fixed percentage of the executive's\nfinal average cash compensation. In the case\nof Messrs. Dolan and von Gillern, their\nsupplemental benefits were frozen in 2001. For\npurposes of this supplemental benefit, final\naverage cash compensation includes annual base\nsalary, annual cash bonuses and other cash\ncompensation awards as determined by the\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee.\nEligibility for these supplemental benefits\nhas been determined by this committee based on\nindividual performance and level of\nresponsibility.\n\nVesting of the supplemental benefit is\ngenerally subject to certain conditions,\nincluding that an executive officer provide a\ncertain number of years of service determined\nby the Compensation and Human Resources\nCommittee. Mr. Cecere is eligible for an\namount of total retirement benefits at age 65\nequal to 55% of the average cash compensation\nduring his final three years of service,\nreduced by his estimated retirement benefits\nfrom Social Security. Mr. Cecere is fully\nvested in his supplemental benefit. Mr. Dolan\nhas a frozen monthly annuity of $522 in which\nhe is fully vested, payable as early as his\ntermination date. Mr. von Gillern also has a\nfrozen monthly annuity benefit of $138 in\nwhich he is fully vested, payable as early as\nhis termination date.\n\nIn accordance with his election, Mr. Cecere's\nsupplemental benefit will be paid in the form\nof a lump sum. For the supplemental benefits\npayable to Messrs. Dolan and von Gillern, the\nstandard form is either a lump sum or a joint\nand survivor annuity, depending on the present\nvalue of the lump sum at retirement.\n\nThe present value of the supplemental benefit\nfor Messrs. Dolan and von Gillern is currently\nless than $400,000, so in accordance with plan\nrules, their supplemental benefit will default\nto payment in a lump sum. Each of Messrs.\nDolan and von Gillern has the option to make\nan election to receive his supplemental\nbenefit as an annuity if the election is made\n12 months prior to the applicable officer's\ntermination date, the officer is over age 55,\nand the present value of the supplemental\nbenefit exceeds $50,000.

The measurement date and material actuarial\nassumptions applied in quantifying the present\nvalue of the current accrued benefits are     \ndiscussed in Note 16 to our consolidated      \nfinancial statements included in our 2020     \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. These assumptions \ninclude the use of a 2.55% discount rate for  \nthe supplemental and excess plans and a 2.91% \ndiscount rate for the qualified pension plan. \nThe mortality assumptions used are based on   \nthe white collar PRI-2012 mortality table     \nprojected generationally using the MP-2020    \nimprovement scale. The average pay used for   \nthe benefit calculations was historical pay   \nthrough the measurement date (December 31,    \n2020).                                        \n                                              \nThe amounts in this column were calculated    \nbased on the earliest age at which the        \napplicable officer is entitled to receive     \nunreduced retirement benefits and ignore any  \nvesting requirements. The earliest age of     \nunreduced retirement benefits is 65 for all   \nour NEOs, and all are currently vested in 100%\nof their pension benefits.                    \n                                              \n2. In the event of the death of one of the    \nofficers in this table, a pre-established     \npercentage of the officer's pension benefits  \nwill be paid to the officer's beneficiary. The\nactual percentage paid to the beneficiary is  \ndependent on the form of payment of benefits  \nelected by the officer. The default percentage\nis 50% to the officer's spouse. An additional \nlump sum death benefit may be payable based on\ncertain actuarial calculations. The present   \nvalue of the payments to an officer's         \nbeneficiary would not exceed the total present\nvalue of accumulated benefits shown in this   \ncolumn, except as described in footnote three \nfor Mr. Cecere. 3. Mr. Cecere is 100% vested  \nand eligible to begin receiving his U.S. Bank \nPension Plan benefit and the pre-2005 portion \nof his excess and supplemental benefits under \nthe U.S. Bank Non-Qualified Retirement Plan   \nupon retirement at any age. The remainder of  \nhis excess and supplemental benefits are      \npayable upon the later of age 62 or           \n                   \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n        \u200b           \n        U.S.       \n  \u200b      Bancorp    \n  55    2021       \n        Proxy      \n        Statement  \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                          \n  \u200b                        \n  Executive compensation  \n                          \nretirement. If any of the vested benefits are \npaid before Mr. Cecere reaches age 65, the    \nbenefits are reduced by certain early         \nretirement benefit formulas specified in the  \napplicable plan for each year prior to Mr.    \nCecere's reaching age 65. These early         \nretirement benefit formulas reduce the annual \npension benefit amount payable to Mr. Cecere  \ndue to the longer benefit payment period      \nrelated to the earlier commencement of        \nbenefits. Per the standard provisions of the  \nsupplemental plan, upon his attainment of age \n60, Mr. Cecere became eligible for five       \naccelerated years of service credit for       \nservice to age 65, worth approximately $2.8   \nmillion; this value will gradually be         \nreflected in the table above and will have no \nextra value if he works to age 65. There is no\neffect on the applicable early reductions or  \nbenefit timing noted above.                   \n                                      \n  Nonqualified deferred compensation  \n                                      \nUnder the U.S. Bank Executive Employees\nDeferred Compensation Plan (2005 Statement)\n(the \"Executive Deferred Compensation Plan\"),\nmembers of our senior management, including\nall of our executive officers, may choose to\ndefer all or a part of their annual base\nsalary and annual cash incentive payments.

The\nmeasurement funds are merely measuring tools\nto determine the amount by which account\nbalances will be debited or credited to\nreflect deemed investment returns on deferred\ncompensation.\n\nAlthough the plan administrator has\nestablished procedures permitting a plan\nparticipant to reallocate deferred amounts\namong these investment alternatives after the\ninitial election to defer, the election to\ndefer is irrevocable, and the deferred\ncompensation will not be paid to the plan\nparticipant until his or her retirement or\nearlier termination of employment.

Payments are made ratably in cash from\neach of the investment alternatives in which\nthe participant has a balance, except the U.S.\nBancorp stock fund, which is generally paid in\nshares. If a participant dies before the\nentire deferred amount has been distributed,\nthe undistributed portion will be paid to the\nparticipant's beneficiary in a single lump\nsum. The benefits under the plan otherwise are\nnot transferable by the participant.\n                   \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b                 \n  U.S.             \n  Bancorp      \u200b    \n  2021         56  \n  Proxy            \n  Statement        \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                          \n  \u200b                        \n  Executive compensation  \n                          \nThe following table summarizes information\nwith respect to the participation of the NEOs\nin any defined contribution or other plan that\nprovides for the deferral of compensation on a\nbasis that is not tax-qualified.\n\nNonqualified deferred compensation for fiscal\n2020\n                                              \n         E\u2026      \u2026      A\u2026             A\u2026     \n         c\u2026      \u2026      e\u2026      \u2026      b\u2026     \n  \u2026      in      \u2026      in      \u2026      at     \n         l\u2026      \u2026      l\u2026      \u2026      l\u2026     \n         FY      \u2026      FY      \u2026      F\u2026     \n         (\u2026      \u2026      (\u2026             (\u2026     \n  \u2026        \u0097      \u0097         \u0097      \u0097         \u0097     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u200b         \u200b      \u200b         \u200b      \u200b         \u200b   \u200b  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        \u0097      \u0097         \u0097      \u0097         \u0097     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u200b         \u200b      \u200b         \u200b      \u200b         \u200b   \u200b  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        \u0097      \u0097         \u0097      \u0097         \u0097     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u200b         \u200b      \u200b         \u200b      \u200b         \u200b   \u200b  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      \u0097       6\u2026      \u0097       4\u2026  \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u200b         \u200b      \u200b         \u200b      \u200b         \u200b   \u200b  \n  \u2026        \u0097      \u0097       3\u2026      \u0097       1\u2026  \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u200b         \u200b      \u200b         \u200b      \u200b         \u200b   \u200b  \n                                              \n1.

Of this amount, $248,385 represents \nMr. Welsh's deferrals of cash compensation,   \nwhich were made in 2019 and 2020. Of the      \namount deferred, $195,097 is deferred salary  \nand deferred incentive pay and is reported in \nthe Summary Compensation Table for the        \napplicable years. The amount also includes    \n$53,288 in deferred incentive pay earned for  \n2018 performance and is not included in the   \nSummary Compensation Table as Mr. Welsh was   \nnot an NEO in 2018. 3. Of this amount,        \n$110,995 represents Ms. Kedia's deferral of   \nincentive cash compensation that was earned   \nfor her 2018 performance, and this amount is  \nincluded in the Summary Compensation Table    \nwith her 2018 compensation.                   \n                                          \n  Potential payments upon termination or  \n  change-in-control                       \n                                          \nGeneral\n\nAny NEO whose employment is voluntarily or\ninvoluntarily terminated is entitled to the\npayments or other benefits that the officer\nhas accrued and is vested in under the benefit\nplans discussed above in this proxy statement,\nincluding under the heading \"Pension\nBenefits.\" Except as is specifically described\nbelow with respect to disability, death or\ntermination of employment following a change-\nin-control of U.S. Bancorp, no NEO is entitled\nto any other benefits upon any employment\ntermination or change-in-control scenario.\n\nPayments made upon disability\n\nCash payments:Under the terms of the U.S. Bank\nNon-Qualified Retirement Plan, Mr. Cecere is\neligible for an annual disability benefit that\nis equal to 60% of his current annual cash\ncompensation. The definition of disability is\nsimilar to that used for the broad-based\ndisability program described below. The\ndefinition of annual cash compensation is the\nsame definition as is used to calculate\nsupplemental pension benefits under this plan,\nwithout using a five-year average. His\nagreement under the non-qualified retirement\nplan provides that Mr. Cecere is eligible to\nreceive disability payments through the\nearlier of the cessation of his disability or\nreaching his normal retirement age.\n\nMessrs. Dolan, von Gillern, and Welsh and Ms.\nKedia are eligible for an annual disability\nbenefit of $150,000 (equal to 50% of annual\ncash compensation, capped at $300,000 of\ncompensation) under the terms of the U.S. Bank\nLong-Term Disability Insurance Plan insured by\nHartford Life and Accident Insurance Company,\nour broad-based disability program. Optional\nadditional disability insurance is available\nfor purchase by those NEOs. The definition of\ndisability is generally that a participant is\nunable to perform material duties of his or\nher own occupation for 24 months following the\nsix-month elimination period, or any\noccupation after 24 months, and suffers a loss\nof at least 20% in predisability earnings. The\ndefinition of annual cash compensation is\nactual cash compensation for a one-year period\nending\n                   \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n  \u200b      \u200b           \n        \u200b           \n        U.S.       \n  \u200b      Bancorp    \n  57    2021       \n        Proxy      \n        Statement  \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                          \n  \u200b                        \n  Executive compensation  \n                          \nSeptember 30. The disability benefit for any\nof the officers would be reduced by any\nbenefits payable under the U.S. Bank Pension\nPlan, Social Security or worker's\ncompensation. The duration of disability\npayments under this broad-based program is\ndependent upon the age of the participant when\nthe disability occurs. Because each of Messrs.\nDolan, von Gillern, and Welsh and Ms. Kedia is\nunder age 63, payments would continue through\nthe earlier of the cessation of their\ndisability or reaching their normal retirement\nage, assuming all other plan conditions are\nmet.\n\nEffect on equity awards:If the employment of\nany of our NEOs who have received equity\ncompensation awards is terminated due to\ndisability, the terms of our stock option,\nPRSU, and most RSU agreements provide that the\nvesting and other terms of those awards will\ncontinue as if the termination of employment\ndid not occur. No financial information for\nthe event of disability is set forth below in\nthe Potential Payments Upon Disability, Death,\nor Termination After a Change-in-Control table\nbelow for the equity awards held by our NEOs\nother than Mr. Welsh, as there is no immediate\nfinancial impact upon the occurrence of this\nevent. Mr. Welsh holds unvested RSUs he was\ngranted when initially hired, and the\nagreement governing that award provides for\nthe acceleration of any unvested RSUs in the\nevent of long-term disability.\n\nPayments made upon death\n\nCash payments:NEOs are eligible to receive\nlife insurance benefits under the same plans\navailable to our other employees. Their\nbenefit is equal to annual cash compensation,\ncapped at $300,000. In addition, optional term\nlife insurance is available for purchase. As\nthis benefit is generally available to all\nsalaried employees and does not discriminate\nin scope, terms, or operation in favor of the\nNEOs, the value has not been quantified in the\nPotential Payments Upon Disability, Death, or\nTermination After a Change-in-Control table.\n\nEffect on equity awards:Most of our equity\naward agreements with NEOs provide for the\nacceleration of any unvested award upon death.\nFor all RSUs and for PRSUs other than those\ngranted in 2018, outstanding units will vest\nupon death. All of our stock option agreements\nalso provide for the acceleration of vesting\nupon death, and the stock option agreements\ngenerally provide that the administrator of\nthe NEO's estate has a three-year period after\ndeath during which to exercise the options.\n\nFor PRSUs granted in 2018, the vesting and\nother terms of the award will continue as if\nthe death did not occur. The value of the\nPRSUs granted in 2018 is accordingly not\nincluded in the amounts payable upon death in\nthe Potential Payments Upon Disability, Death,\nor Termination After a Change-in-Control table\nbelow.\n\nPayments upon termination after a change-in-\ncontrol\n\nCash payments:None of our NEOs is entitled to\nany cash payments in connection with a change-\nin-control of U.S. Bancorp.\n\nEffect on equity awards:Most of our equity\naward agreements provide for acceleration of\nthe vesting of any unvested award if an NEO's\nemployment is involuntarily terminated within\n12 months after a change-in-control of U.S.\nBancorp other than for cause. For all RSUs and\nfor PRSUs other than those granted in 2018,\noutstanding units will vest upon a qualifying\ntermination. All of our stock option\nagreements also provide for acceleration after\na qualifying termination, and accelerated\nstock options may be exercised at any time\nduring the 12 months following the NEO's\ntermination.\n\nFor PRSUs granted in 2018, the vesting and\nother terms of the award will continue as if\nthe termination following a change-in-control\ndid not occur. The value of the PRSUs granted\nin 2018 is accordingly not included in the\namounts payable upon involuntary termination\n(other than for cause) after a change-in-\ncontrol in the Potential Payments Upon\nDisability, Death, or Termination After a\nChange-in-Control table below.\n\nQuantification of estimated payments and\nbenefits\n\nThe following table shows potential annual\ncash payments to the NEOs upon disability and\nthe potential benefits the NEOs could accrue\nthrough accelerated equity vesting upon death\nor involuntary termination of employment\n(other than for cause) following a change-in-\ncontrol of U.S. Bancorp. The table also shows\nthe potential benefit Mr. Welsh could accrue\nthrough accelerated vesting of RSUs upon\ndisability. No information regarding pension\namounts payable to the NEOs is shown in the\nfollowing table; applicable pension amounts\npayable to these executive officers are\ndiscussed above under the heading \"Pension\nBenefits.\"\n                   \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b                 \n  U.S.             \n  Bancorp      \u200b    \n  2021         58  \n  Proxy            \n  Statement        \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                          \n  \u200b                        \n  Executive compensation  \n                          \nThe amounts shown assume that termination was\neffective as of December 31, 2020, and are\nestimates of the amounts that would be paid to\nthe NEOs upon termination, in addition to the\nbase salary and cash incentive payments earned\nby them during 2020.

We\nconsidered any person to whom we delivered a\nForm W-2 Wage and Tax Statement for services\nperformed in 2020 to be a U.S.-based employee,\nand this group includes full-time, part-time,\nand temporary workers. For purposes of\ndetermining the compensation paid to the\nemployees under consideration, we used\nearnings subject to Medicare tax as reported\nin Box 5, \"Medicare wages and tips,\" on each\nemployee's 2020 Form W-2. We did not annualize\nthe compensation of anyone who was employed by\nus for only part of the year.\n\nIn accordance with the \"de minimis\" exemption\nprovided in Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we\nexcluded from consideration all of our\nnon-U.S. employees. As of December 31, 2020,\nwe had 2,686 non-U.S. employees, representing\napproximately 3.9% of our total U.S. and\nnon-U.S. workforce of 68,989 active employees\non that date. The excluded employees work in\nthe following jurisdictions: Ireland (995),\nPoland (764), United Kingdom (492), Canada\n(180), Spain (103), Germany (69), Norway (37),\nLithuania (26), Sweden (10), Luxembourg (8),\nBelize (1), and Cayman Islands (1).\n\nWe determined our median employee's total\ncompensation in the same manner that we\ndetermined the CEO's compensation for purposes\nof this pay ratio disclosure.\n                   \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b                 \n  U.S.             \n  Bancorp      \u200b    \n  2021         60  \n  Proxy            \n  Statement        \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                         \n  \u200b                       \n  Director compensation  \n                         \nDirector compensation\n\nDetermining compensation for non-employee\ndirectors\n\nThe Compensation and Human Resources Committee\nretained its independent compensation\nconsultant to provide advice regarding non-\nemployee director compensation in 2020. Before\nrecommending a non-employee director\ncompensation program to the independent\nmembers of the Board for approval, the\nCommittee reviewed director compensation\ninformation for our compensation peer group\ncompanies to check the alignment of our\ncompensation package with market practice and\ncurrent trends. The detailed peer data that\nwas reviewed included information about\ncompensation paid per director, total board\ncompensation cost, the absolute and relative\namounts attributable to various compensation\ncomponents, additional retainers paid to lead\nindependent directors and committee chairs,\nand stock ownership requirements.\n\nCash compensation for Board and committee\nservice in the April 2020 \u0096 April 2021 term\n\nOur non-employee directors received the\nfollowing cash fees for serving on the Board\nand committees this term:\n                                              \n                               \u200b   Retainer    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Annual retainer for          $   100,000    \n  service on the Board                        \n  \u200b                             \u200b           \u200b    \n  Additional annual                           \n  retainer for Lead            $    50,000    \n  Director                                    \n  \u200b                             \u200b           \u200b    \n  Additional annual                           \n  retainer for chairs of                      \n  Capital Planning,                           \n  Compensation and Human       $    25,000    \n  Resources, Governance,                      \n  and Public                                  \n  Responsibility Committees                   \n  \u200b                             \u200b           \u200b    \n  Additional annual                           \n  retainer for chairs of       $    40,000    \n  Audit and Risk Management                   \n  Committees                                  \n  \u200b                             \u200b           \u200b    \n  Additional annual                           \n  retainer for other                          \n  members of Audit and Risk    $    15,000    \n  Management                                  \n  Committees                                  \n  \u200b                             \u200b           \u200b    \n                                              \nEach non-employee director who served on U.S.\nBancorp's primary banking subsidiary's board\nof directors or on any ad hoc committee of the\nU.S. Bancorp Board of Directors received\n$1,500 per meeting for that service. Each non-\nemployee director was also paid $1,500 for\neach meeting he or she attended that was not a\nregularly scheduled Board or committee\nmeeting.\n\nEquity award for Board service in the April\n2020 \u0096 April 2021 term\n\nAs part of the non-employee director\ncompensation program for Board service during\nthe April 2020 \u0096 April 2021 term that the\nindependent members of the Board had approved\nin late 2019, each of our non-employee\ndirectors was entitled to receive an annual\naward of restricted stock units with a grant\ndate fair value of approximately $160,000\nunder the U.S. Bancorp 2015 Stock Incentive\nPlan. In April 2020, the non-employee\ndirectors elected to reduce their equity award\nfor the term by 33% to recognize the impacts\nof the COVID-19 pandemic on the company and\nthe economy. Accordingly, each non-employee\ndirector received an award of restricted stock\nunits with a grant date fair value of\napproximately $106,667 for his or her Board\nservice in the April 2020 \u0096 April 2021 term.\n\nThe U.S. Bancorp 2015 Stock Incentive Plan\nprovides that no non-employee director may\nreceive an equity award or awards with an\naggregate grant date fair value in excess of\n$600,000 in any calendar year. The restricted\nstock units were fully vested at the time of\ngrant, but the underlying shares will not be\ndelivered until the director ceases to serve\non the Board. Each non-employee director may\nelect to have all of his or her shares\ndelivered promptly following cessation of\nservice or to have the shares delivered in ten\nannual installments. Each non-employee\ndirector is entitled to receive additional\nfully vested restricted stock units having a\nfair market value equal to the amount of\ndividends he or she would have received had\nrestricted stock been awarded instead of\nrestricted stock units.\n\nDirector stock ownership requirements\n\nThe Compensation and Human Resources Committee\nhas established stock ownership requirements\nfor each non-employee director equal to five\ntimes the value of the annual cash retainer.\nNew directors must satisfy this minimum\nownership level within five years after\njoining the Board. As of December 31, 2020,\nall the directors had sufficient holdings to\nmeet or exceed the stock ownership\nrequirements, or had not yet served on our\nBoard for five years.\n\nDeferred compensation plan participation\n\nUnder the U.S. Bank Outside Directors Deferred\nCompensation Plan (2005 Statement) (the\n\"Director Deferred Compensation Plan\"), our\nnon-employee directors may choose to defer all\nor a part of their cash fees.

That other person is\ncalled a proxy. If you designate someone as\nyour proxy in a written document, that\ndocument also is called a proxy or a proxy\ncard. When you designate a proxy, you also may\ndirect the proxy how to vote your shares. We\nrefer to this as your \"proxy vote.\" Andrew\nCecere, our Chairman, President and Chief\nExecutive Officer, and Laura F. Bednarski, our\nCorporate Secretary, have been designated as\nthe proxies to cast the votes of our\nshareholders at our 2021 annual meeting of\nshareholders.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the meeting?\n\nAt our annual meeting, shareholders will act\nupon the matters outlined in the notice of\nannual meeting of shareholders and described\nin this proxy statement. Management will also\nreport on our 2020 performance and, once the\nbusiness of the annual meeting is concluded,\nrespond to questions submitted in writing\nduring or before the meeting.\n\nHow can I access the proxy materials and vote\nmy shares?\n\nThe instructions for accessing the proxy\nmaterials and voting can be found in the\ninformation you received either by mail or\ne-mail. Depending on how you received the\nproxy materials, you may vote by Internet,\ntelephone or mail. We encourage you to vote by\nInternet.\n\n\u25b6 If you are a shareholder who received a\nnotice by mail regarding the Internet\navailability of the proxy materials: You may\naccess the proxy materials and voting\ninstructions over the Internet via the web\naddress provided in the notice. In order to\naccess this material and vote, you will need\nthe 16-digit control number provided on the\nnotice you received in the mail. You may vote\nby following the instructions on the notice or\non the website.\n\n\u25b6 If you are a shareholder who received an\ne-mail directing you to the proxy materials:\nYou may access the proxy materials and voting\ninstructions over the Internet via the web\naddress provided in the e-mail. In order to\naccess these materials and vote, you will need\nthe 16-digit control number provided in the\ne-mail. You may vote by following the\ninstructions in the e-mail or on the website.\n\n\u25b6 If you are a shareholder who received the\nproxy materials by mail: You may vote your\nshares by following the instructions provided\non the proxy card or voting instruction form.\nIf you vote by Internet or telephone, you will\nneed the 16-digit control number provided on\nthe proxy card or voting instruction form. If\nyou vote by mail, please complete, sign and\ndate the proxy card or voting instruction form\nand mail it in the accompanying pre-addressed\nenvelope.\n\nHow do I vote if my shares are held in the\nU.S. Bank 401(k) Savings Plan?\n\nIf you hold any shares in the U.S. Bank 401(k)\nSavings Plan, you are receiving, or being\nprovided access to, the same proxy materials\nas any other shareholder. However, your proxy\nvote will serve as voting instructions to the\nplan trustee. Your voting instructions must be\nreceived at least five days prior to the\nannual meeting in order to count. In\naccordance with the terms of the plan, the\ntrustee will vote all of the shares held in\nthe plan in the same proportion as the actual\nproxy votes submitted by plan participants at\nleast five days prior to the annual meeting.\n\nWhy did I receive a notice regarding the\nInternet availability of proxy materials\ninstead of a printed copy of the proxy\nmaterials?\n\nIn accordance with rules adopted by the SEC,\nwe are furnishing our proxy materials to our\nshareholders primarily over the Internet\ninstead of mailing printed copies of those\nmaterials to each shareholder. By doing so, we\nreduce costs and lessen the environmental\nimpact of our proxy solicitation. On or about\nMarch 9, 2021, we mailed a notice of Internet\navailability of the proxy materials to most of\nour shareholders. The notice contains\ninstructions about how to access our\n                   \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b                 \n  U.S.             \n  Bancorp      \u200b    \n  2021         70  \n  Proxy            \n  Statement        \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  \u200b                                            \n  Questions and answers about the annual      \n  meeting and voting                          \n                                              \nproxy materials and vote online. This notice\nis not a proxy card and cannot be used to vote\nyour shares. If you received a notice but\nwould like to receive a paper copy of our\nproxy materials, please follow the\ninstructions on the notice.\n\nOur other shareholders, including shareholders\nwho have previously requested to receive paper\ncopies of the proxy materials and persons\nholding shares through our benefit plans,\nreceived paper copies of the proxy materials\ninstead of a notice. If you received paper\ncopies of the notice or proxy materials, we\nencourage you to sign up to receive all of\nyour future proxy materials electronically, as\ndescribed under \"How can I receive my proxy\nmaterials by e-mail in the future?\" below.\n\nWho is entitled to vote at the meeting?\n\nThe Board has set February 23, 2021, as the\nrecord date for the annual meeting. If you\nwere a shareholder at the close of business on\nFebruary 23, 2021, you are entitled to vote at\nthe meeting. As of the record date,\n1,502,573,964 shares of our common stock were\nissued and outstanding and, therefore,\neligible to vote at the meeting.\n\nWhat are my voting rights?\n\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to\none vote per share. Therefore, a total of\n1,502,573,964 votes are entitled to be cast at\nthe meeting. There is no cumulative voting.\n\nHow many shares must be present to hold the\nmeeting?\n\nIn accordance with our bylaws, shares equal to\nat least one-third of the voting power of our\noutstanding shares of common stock as of the\nrecord date must be present at the meeting in\norder to hold the meeting and conduct\nbusiness. This is called a quorum. Your shares\nare counted as present at the meeting if:\n\nWhat is the difference between a shareholder\nof record and a \"street name\" holder?\n\nIf your shares are registered directly in your\nname with our transfer agent, Computershare\nInvestor Services, you are considered the\nshareholder of record with respect to those\nshares.\n\nIf your shares are held in a stock brokerage\naccount or by a bank, trust company or other\nnominee, then the broker, bank, trust company\nor other nominee is considered to be the\nshareholder of record with respect to those\nshares. However, you still are considered the\nbeneficial owner of those shares and your\nshares are said to be held in \"street name.\"\nStreet name holders generally cannot vote\ntheir shares directly and must instead\ninstruct the broker, bank, trust company or\nother nominee how to vote their shares using\nthe voting instruction form provided by it.\n\nHow do I attend the virtual meeting?\n\nDue to the public health concerns regarding\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, we are holding the 2021\nAnnual Meeting of Shareholders in a virtual-\nonly format. You will not be able to attend\nthe annual meeting at a physical location.

Even if you currently plan to attend the\nvirtual meeting, we recommend that you submit\nyour proxy as described above so that your\nvote will be counted if you later decide not\nto attend the meeting. If you are a\nparticipant in the U.S. Bank 401(k) Savings\nPlan or hold your shares in street name, you\nmay submit your vote as described above, but\nyou may not vote your 401(k) Savings Plan\nshares or shares held in street name during\nthe meeting.\n\nWhat if I am a shareholder of record and do\nnot specify how I want my shares voted?\n\nIf you submit your proxy by Internet or submit\na signed proxy card and do not specify how you\nwant to vote your shares, we will vote your\nshares in accordance with the recommendations\nof the Board. Our telephone voting procedures\ndo not permit you to submit your proxy vote by\ntelephone without specifying how you want your\nshares voted.\n\nWhat if I hold my shares in street name and do\nnot provide voting instructions?\n\nIf you hold your shares in street name and do\nnot provide voting instructions, your broker,\nbank, trust company or other nominee has\ndiscretionary authority to vote your shares on\nthe ratification of the selection of Ernst &\nYoung LLP as our independent auditor. However,\nin the absence of your specific instructions\nas to how to vote, your broker, bank, trust\ncompany or other nominee does not have\ndiscretionary authority to vote on any other\nproposal. Such a situation results in a\n\"broker non-vote,\" which does not have an\neffect on the outcome of the proposal. It is\nimportant, therefore, that you provide\ninstructions to your broker, bank, trust\ncompany or other nominee so that your vote\nwith respect to the other proposals is\ncounted.\n\nWhat is the voting standard and what is the\neffect of abstentions?\n\nYou may vote \"FOR,\" \"AGAINST\" or \"ABSTAIN\"\nwith respect to each nominee for the Board of\nDirectors (Proposal 1), the ratification of\nthe selection of independent auditor (Proposal\n2), and the advisory vote on executive\ncompensation (Proposal 3).\n\nThe following table summarizes the voting\nstandard applicable to each proposal and the\neffect of an \"ABSTAIN\" vote in each instance.\n                                              \n                 Voting          Effect of    \n  Proposal       standard        \"ABSTAIN\"    \n                                 vote         \n                 The nominee                  \n                 is elected                   \n                 if the                       \n                 number of                    \n                 votes cast                   \n  Election of    \"FOR\" him or    No effect    \n  directors      her exceeds                  \n                 the number                   \n                 of votes                     \n                 cast                         \n                 \"AGAINST\"                    \n                 him or her                   \n  \u200b               \u200b                \u200b             \n                 The proposal                 \n                 is approved                  \n                 if \"FOR\"                     \n                 votes are       Same effect  \n  Other          cast by the     as           \n  proposals      majority of     \"AGAINST\"    \n                 shares          vote         \n                 present and                  \n                 entitled to                  \n                 vote on the                  \n                 matter                       \n  \u200b               \u200b                \u200b             \n                                              \nWhat does it mean if I receive more than one\nnotice of Internet availability of proxy\nmaterials, proxy card, voting instruction\nform, or e-mail with instructions on how to\naccess the proxy materials?\n\nIf you receive more than one notice of\nInternet availability of proxy materials,\nproxy card, voting instruction form, or e-mail\nwith instructions on how to access the proxy\nmaterials, it means that you hold shares in\nmore than one account.\n                   \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b             \u200b    \n  \u200b                 \n  U.S.             \n  Bancorp      \u200b    \n  2021         72  \n  Proxy            \n  Statement        \n                   \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  \u200b                                            \n  Questions and answers about the annual      \n  meeting and voting                          \n                                              \nTo ensure that all of your shares are voted,\nvote separately for each notice of Internet\navailability of proxy materials, proxy card,\nvoting instruction form, and e-mail you\nreceive.\n\nCan I change my vote after submitting my\nproxy?\n\nYes. You may revoke your proxy and change your\nvote at any time before your proxy is voted at\nthe annual meeting. If you are a shareholder\nof record, you may revoke your proxy and\nchange your vote by:\n\nTo request an additional proxy card, or if you\nhave any questions about the annual meeting or\nhow to vote or revoke your proxy, you should\nwrite to Investor Relations, U.S. Bancorp, 800\nNicollet Mall, Minneapolis, MN 55402 or call\n866.775.9668.\n\nIf you hold your shares in street name,\ncontact your broker, bank, trust company or\nother nominee regarding how to revoke your\nproxy and change your vote.

We have procedures to ensure that all\nproxies, ballots and voting tabulations that\nidentify shareholders are kept permanently\nconfidential, except as follows: to meet legal\nrequirements, to assert claims for or defend\nclaims against our company, to allow\nauthorized individuals to count and certify\nthe results of the shareholder vote if a proxy\nsolicitation in opposition to the Board takes\nplace, or to respond to shareholders who have\nwritten comments on proxy cards or who have\nrequested disclosure. We also have the voting\ntabulations performed by an independent third\nparty.\n\nWho will count the votes?\n\nRepresentatives of Broadridge Financial\nSolutions, Inc., our tabulation agent, will\ntabulate the votes and act as independent\ninspectors of election.\n\nWho pays for the cost of proxy preparation and\nsolicitation?\n\nWe pay for the cost of proxy preparation and\nsolicitation, including the reasonable charges\nand expenses of brokerage firms, banks, trust\ncompanies or other nominees for forwarding\nproxy materials to street name holders. We\nhave retained Alliance Advisors, LLC, to\nassist in the solicitation of proxies for the\nannual meeting for a fee of $20,000, plus\nassociated costs and expenses.\n\nWe are soliciting proxies primarily by mail.\nIn addition, our directors, officers and\nemployees may solicit proxies by telephone,\nfacsimile, e-mail or in person. They will not\nreceive any additional compensation for these\nactivities.\n\nDo we \"household\" annual meeting materials?\n\nThe SEC rules allow a single copy of the\nnotice of Internet availability of proxy\nmaterials or proxy statement and annual report\nto be delivered to multiple shareholders\nsharing the same address and last name, or who\nwe reasonably believe are members of the same\nfamily, and who consent to receive a single\ncopy of these materials in a manner provided\nby these rules. This practice is referred to\nas \"householding.\" Although we do not\nhousehold for our registered shareholders, we\nunderstand that some brokers, banks, trust\ncompanies and other nominees household U.S.\nBancorp notices of Internet availability of\nproxy materials or proxy statements and annual\nreports, delivering a single copy of each to\nmultiple shareholders sharing an address\nunless contrary instructions have been\nreceived from the affected shareholders. Once\nyou have received notice from your broker,\nbank, trust company or other nominee that it\nwill be householding materials to your\naddress, householding will continue until you\nare notified otherwise or until you revoke\nyour consent.\n\nIf, at any time, you no longer wish to\nparticipate in householding and would prefer\nto receive a separate copy of our notice of\nInternet availability of proxy materials or\nproxy statement or annual report, or if you\nare receiving multiple copies of any of these\ndocuments and wish to receive only one, please\nnotify your broker, bank, trust company or\nother nominee.

Your e-mail\naddress will be kept separate from any other\ncompany operations and will be used for no\nother purpose.\n\nIf we mailed you a notice of Internet\navailability of proxy materials or a printed\ncopy of our proxy statement and annual report\nand you would like to sign up to receive these\nmaterials by e-mail in the future, you can\nchoose this option by:\n\nYou may revoke this request at any time by\nfollowing the instructions at\nhttp://enroll.icsdelivery.com/usb.
