attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $1.5   \nbillion for the second quarter of 2022, or    \n$0.99 per diluted common share, compared with \n$2.0 billion, or $1.28 per diluted common     \nshare, for the second quarter of 2021. Return \non average assets and return on average common\nequity were 1.06 percent and 13.9 percent,    \nrespectively, for the second quarter of 2022, \ncompared with 1.44 percent and 16.3 percent,  \nrespectively, for the second quarter of 2021. \nThe results for the second quarter of 2022    \nincluded the impact of $197 million ($153     \nmillion net-of-tax) of merger and integration-\nrelated charges associated with the planned   \nacquisition of MUFG Union Bank\u2019s core regional\nbanking franchise from Mitsubishi UFJ         \nFinancial Group, Inc. (\u201cMUFG\u201d), which         \ndecreased diluted earnings per common share by\n$0.10. Total net revenue for the second       \nquarter of 2022 was $229 million (4.0 percent)\nhigher than the second quarter of 2021,       \nreflecting a 9.5 percent increase in net      \ninterest income and a 2.7 percent decrease in \nnoninterest income. The increase in net       \ninterest income from the second quarter of    \n2021 was primarily due to higher average loan \nand investment securities balances, as well as\nrising interest rates in the current year and \nthe impact of a favorable yield curve on      \nearning assets, partially offset by deposit   \npricing changes and lower loan fees driven by \nthe impact of loan forgiveness related to the \nSmall Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) Paycheck\nProtection Program in the second quarter of   \n2021. The reduction in noninterest income     \nreflected lower mortgage banking revenue as   \nrefinancing activities declined, lower other  \nnoninterest income and lower gains on the sale\nof securities, mostly offset by higher payment\nservices revenue and trust and investment     \nmanagement fees. Noninterest expense in the   \nsecond quarter of 2022 was $337 million (9.9  \npercent) higher than the second quarter of    \n2021, reflecting increases in compensation    \nexpense, employee benefits expense, marketing \nand business development expense, and the     \nimpact of merger and integration-related      \ncharges of $197 million. The provision for    \ncredit losses for the second quarter of 2022  \nwas $311 million, compared with a benefit of  \n$170 million for the second quarter of 2021.  \nThe provision for credit losses in the second \nquarter of 2022 reflected the impact of loan  \ngrowth and increasing economic uncertainty.   \nThe provision for credit losses for the second\nquarter of 2021 reflected a decrease in the   \nallowance for credit losses as a result of    \nimproving economic conditions and credit      \nquality. Net charge-offs in the second quarter\nof 2022 were $161 million, compared with $180 \nmillion in the second quarter of 2021. Refer  \nto \u201cCorporate Risk Profile\u201d for further       \ninformation on the provision for credit       \nlosses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets \nand other factors considered by the Company in\nassessing the credit quality of the loan      \nportfolio and establishing the allowance for  \ncredit losses. Net income attributable to U.S.\nBancorp for the first six months of 2022 was  \n$3.1 billion, or $1.97 per diluted common     \nshare, compared with $4.3 billion, or $2.73   \nper diluted common share, for the first six   \nmonths of 2021. Return on average assets and  \nreturn on average common equity were 1.08     \npercent and 13.3 percent, respectively, for   \nthe first six months of 2022, compared with   \n1.56 percent and 17.6 percent, respectively,  \nfor the first six months of 2021. Total net   \nrevenue for the first six months of 2022 was  \n$355 million (3.2 percent) higher than the    \nfirst six months of 2021, reflecting a 6.6    \npercent increase in net interest income and a \n1.1 percent decrease in noninterest income.   \nThe increase in net interest income from the  \nfirst six months of 2021 was primarily due to \nhigher average loan and investment securities \nbalances, as well as rising interest rates in \nthe current year and the impact of a favorable\nyield curve on earning assets, partially      \noffset by deposit pricing changes and lower   \nloan fees driven by the impact of loan        \nforgiveness related to the SBA Paycheck       \nProtection Program in the first six months of \n2021. The reduction in noninterest income     \nreflected lower mortgage banking revenue,     \nlower other noninterest income and lower gains\non the sale of securities, mostly offset by   \nhigher payment services revenue and trust and \ninvestment management fees. Noninterest       \nexpense in the first six months of 2022 was   \n$460 million (6.8 percent) higher than the    \nfirst six months of 2021, reflecting increases\nin compensation expense, employee benefits    \nexpense, marketing and business development   \nexpense, professional services expense and the\nimpact of merger and integration-related      \ncharges of $197 million. The provision for    \ncredit losses for the first six months of 2022\nwas $423 million, compared with a benefit of  \n                     \n  4    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n$997 million for the first six months of 2021.\nThe provision for credit losses for the first \nsix months of 2022 reflected the impact of    \nloan growth and increasing economic           \nuncertainty. The provision for credit losses  \nfor the first six months of 2021 reflected a  \ndecrease in the allowance for credit losses as\na result of improving economic conditions and \ncredit quality. Net charge-offs in the first  \nsix months of 2022 were $323 million, compared\nwith $403 million in the first six months of  \n2021. Refer to \u201cCorporate Risk Profile\u201d for   \nfurther information on the provision for      \ncredit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming \nassets and other factors considered by the    \nCompany in assessing the credit quality of the\nloan portfolio and establishing the allowance \nfor credit losses. Pending Acquisition In     \nSeptember 2021, the Company announced that it \nentered into a definitive agreement to acquire\nMUFG Union Bank\u2019s core regional banking       \nfranchise, for an expected purchase price of  \napproximately $8.0 billion, including $5.5    \nbillion in cash and approximately 44 million  \nshares of the Company\u2019s common stock. The     \ntransaction excludes the purchase of          \nsubstantially all of MUFG Union Bank\u2019s Global \nCorporate & Investment Bank (other than       \ncertain deposits), certain middle and back    \noffice functions, and other assets.

Closing of the    \ntransaction is subject to customary closing   \nconditions, including regulatory approvals    \nwhich are not within the Company\u2019s control.   \nThe parties continue to make significant      \nprogress in planning for closing and          \nintegration while awaiting regulatory         \napprovals. At this time, the Company expects  \nto receive U.S. regulatory approvals in time  \nfor closing to occur in the second half of    \n2022. STATEMENT OF INCOME ANALYSIS Net        \nInterest Income Net interest income, on a     \ntaxable-equivalent basis, was $3.5 billion in \nthe second quarter and $6.7 billion in the    \nfirst six months of 2022, representing        \nincreases of $300 million (9.5 percent) and   \n$411 million (6.6 percent), respectively,     \ncompared with the same periods of 2021. The   \nincreases were primarily due to higher loan   \nand investment securities balances, in        \naddition to rising interest rates in the      \ncurrent year and a favorable yield curve      \nimpacting earning assets, partially offset by \ndeposit pricing changes and lower loan fees   \ndriven by the impact of loan forgiveness      \nrelated to the SBA Paycheck Protection Program\nin the first six months of 2021. Average      \nearning assets for the second quarter and     \nfirst six months of 2022 were $36.0 billion   \n(7.2 percent) and $34.1 billion (6.8 percent) \nhigher, respectively, than the same periods of\nthe prior year, reflecting increases in       \ninvestment securities and loans, partially    \noffset by decreases in interest-bearing       \ndeposits with banks. The net interest margin, \non a taxable-equivalent basis, in the second  \nquarter and first six months of 2022 was 2.59 \npercent and 2.51 percent, respectively,       \ncompared with 2.53 percent and 2.52 percent in\nthe second quarter and first six months of    \n2021, respectively. The increase in net       \ninterest margin in the second quarter of 2022,\ncompared with the second quarter of 2021, was \nprimarily due to the net impact of rising     \ninterest rates in the current year and higher \nyields in the investment portfolio, partially \noffset by deposit pricing and loan mix        \nchanges. The decrease in net interest margin  \nin the first six months of 2022, compared with\nthe first six months of 2021, was primarily   \ndriven by earning asset mix and lower loan    \nfees driven by the impact of loan forgiveness \nrelated to the SBA Paycheck Protection        \nProgram. Refer to the \u201cConsolidated Daily     \nAverage Balance Sheet and Related Yields and  \nRates\u201d table for further information on net   \ninterest income. Average total loans in the   \nsecond quarter and first six months of 2022   \nwere $29.9 billion (10.2 percent) and $24.5   \nbillion (8.3 percent) higher, respectively,   \nthan the same periods of 2021. The increases  \nwere primarily due to strong growth in        \ncommercial loans, residential mortgages and   \nother retail loans. The increase in commercial\nloans was primarily due to higher utilization \ndriven by working capital needs of corporate  \ncustomers, slower payoffs given higher        \nvolatility in the capital markets, as well as \ncore growth, partially offset by expected     \nreductions related to the forgiveness of loans\nin the SBA Paycheck Protection Program. The   \nincrease in residential mortgages was driven  \nby stronger on-balancesheet loan activities   \nand slower refinance activity. The increase in\nother retail loans was driven by higher auto  \nand recreational vehicle loans, partially     \noffset by lower retail leasing balances and   \nhome equity and second mortgages. Average     \ninvestment securities in the second quarter   \nand first six months of 2022 were $10.7       \nbillion (6.7 percent) and $19.9 billion (13.0 \npercent) higher, respectively, than the same  \nperiods of 2021, primarily due to purchases of\nmortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities, \nnet of prepayments, sales and maturities.     \nAverage total deposits for the second quarter \nand first six months of 2022 were $27.3       \nbillion (6.4 percent) and $27.6 billion (6.4  \npercent) higher, respectively, than the same  \nperiods of 2021. Average total savings        \ndeposits for the second quarter and first six \nmonths of 2022 were $29.7 billion (10.6       \npercent) and $25.1 billion (9.0 percent)      \nhigher, respectively, than the same periods of\nthe prior year, driven by increases in        \nCorporate and Commercial Banking, and Consumer\nand Business                                  \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    5  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nBanking balances. Average time deposits for   \nthe second quarter and first six months of    \n2022 were $2.1 billion (8.5 percent) higher   \nand $115 million (0.4 percent) lower,         \nrespectively, than the same periods of the    \nprior year. The changes in time deposits were \nprimarily driven by increases in Corporate and\nCommercial Banking balances, offset by        \ndecreases in Consumer and Business Banking    \nbalances. Changes in time deposits are        \nprimarily related to those deposits managed as\nan alternative to other funding sources, based\nlargely on relative pricing and liquidity     \ncharacteristics. Average noninterest-bearing  \ndeposits for the second quarter of 2022 were  \n$4.5 billion (3.6 percent) lower than the     \nsecond quarter of 2021, driven by decreases in\nCorporate and Commercial Banking, Consumer and\nBusiness Banking, and Payment Services        \nbalances, partially offset by an increase in  \nWealth Management and Investment Services     \nbalances. Average noninterest-bearing deposits\nfor the first six months of 2022 were $2.5    \nbillion (2.1 percent) higher than the first   \nsix months of 2021, primarily due to increases\nin Wealth Management and Investment Services, \nand Corporate and Commercial Banking balances,\npartially offset by decreases in Payment      \nServices and Consumer and Business Banking    \nbalances. Provision for Credit Losses The     \nprovision for credit losses was $311 million  \nin the second quarter and $423 million in     \nfirst six months of 2022, compared with a     \nbenefit of $170 million and $997 million,     \nrespectively, for the same periods of 2021.   \nThe provision for credit losses in the second \nquarter and first six months of 2022 reflected\nthe impact of loan growth and increasing      \neconomic uncertainty primarily associated with\nongoing supply chain challenges and rising    \ninflationary concerns. The provision for      \ncredit losses in the second quarter and first \nsix months of 2021 reflected the enactment of \nadditional government stimulus programs and   \nwidespread COVID-19vaccine availability,      \ncontributing to economic improvement during   \nthe period, which resulted in significant     \ndecreases in the allowance for credit losses. \nNet charge-offs decreased $19 million (10.6   \npercent) in the second quarter and $80 million\n(19.9 percent) in the first six months of     \n2022, compared with the same periods of the   \nprior year, primarily driven by lower credit  \ncard net charge-offs. Refer to \u201cCorporate Risk\nProfile\u201d for further information on the       \nprovision for credit losses, net charge-offs, \nnonperforming assets and other factors        \nconsidered by the Company in assessing the    \ncredit quality of the loan portfolio and      \nestablishing the allowance for credit losses. \nNoninterest Income Noninterest income was $2.5\nbillion in the second quarter and $4.9 billion\nin the first six months of 2022, representing \ndecreases of $71 million (2.7 percent) and $56\nmillion (1.1 percent), respectively, compared \nwith the same periods of 2021. The decreases  \nfrom the prior year reflected lower mortgage  \nbanking revenue, lower other noninterest      \nincome and lower gains on the sale of         \nsecurities, mostly offset by higher payment   \nservices revenue and trust and investment     \nmanagement fees. Mortgage banking revenue     \ndecreased primarily due to lower application  \nvolume, given declining refinance activities  \nexperienced in the mortgage industry, lower   \nrelated gain on sale margins and lower        \nperforming loan sales, partially offset by    \nincreases in mortgage servicing rights        \n(\u201cMSRs\u201d) valuations, net of hedging           \nactivities. Other noninterest income decreased\nprimarily due to lower retail leasing end-of- \nterm residual gains and lower gains on sales  \nof certain assets. Payment services revenue   \nincreased as a result of increases in         \ncorporate payment products revenue due to     \nhigher sales volume and increases in merchant \nprocessing services revenue driven by higher  \nsales volume and merchant fees. Trust and     \ninvestment management fees increased primarily\ndue to business growth, activity related to   \nthe fourth quarter of 2021 acquisition of PFM \nAsset Management LLC (\u201cPFM\u201d) and lower money  \nmarket fee waivers.                           \n                                 \n  Table\u00a02    Noninterest Income  \n                                 \n                                              \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      \u2026      $      $      \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n      $      $      \u2026      $      $      \u2026    \n                                              \n                     \n  6    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nNoninterest Expense Noninterest expense was   \n$3.7 billion in the second quarter and $7.2   \nbillion in the first six months of 2022,      \nrepresenting increases of $337 million (9.9   \npercent) and $460 million (6.8 percent),      \nrespectively, over the same periods of 2021.  \nThe increases from the prior year reflected   \nhigher compensation expense, employee benefits\nexpense, marketing and business development   \nexpense, and the impact of merger and         \nintegration-related charges associated with   \nthe planned acquisition of MUFG Union Bank.   \nCompensation expense increased primarily due  \nto merit increases and hiring to support      \nbusiness growth, partially offset by lower    \nperformance-based incentives. Employee        \nbenefits expense increased primarily driven by\nhigher medical expenses. Marketing and        \nbusiness development expense increased due to \nincreased travel and entertainment. Marketing \nand business development expense further      \nincreased in the first six months of 2022,    \ncompared with the first six months of 2021,   \ndue to the timing of marketing campaigns.     \nNoninterest expense further increased in the  \nfirst six months of 2022, compared with the   \nfirst six months of 2021, due to higher       \nprofessional services expense reflecting an   \nincrease in business investment and related   \ninitiatives during the current year. Income   \nTax Expense The provision for income taxes was\n$414 million (an effective rate of 21.3       \npercent) for the second quarter and $811      \nmillion (an effective rate of 20.8 percent)   \nfor the first six months of 2022, compared    \nwith $551 million (an effective rate of 21.7  \npercent) and $1.2 billion (an effective rate  \nof 21.3 percent) for the same periods of 2021,\nrespectively.

BALANCE    \nSHEET ANALYSIS Loans The Company\u2019s loan       \nportfolio was $332.4 billion at June 30, 2022,\ncompared with $312.0 billion at December 31,  \n2021, an increase of $20.4 billion (6.5       \npercent). The increase was driven by higher   \ncommercial loans, residential mortgages,      \ncredit card loans and commercial real estate  \nloans, partially offset by lower other retail \nloans. Commercial loans increased $14.0       \nbillion (12.5 percent) at June 30, 2022,      \ncompared with December 31, 2021, due to higher\nutilization driven by working capital needs of\ncorporate customers and slower payoffs given  \nhigher volatility in the capital markets, as  \nwell as core growth. Residential mortgages    \nheld in the loan portfolio increased $5.6     \nbillion (7.3 percent) at June 30, 2022,       \ncompared with December 31, 2021, due to       \nstronger on-balancesheet loan activities and  \nslower refinance activity. Residential        \nmortgages originated and placed in the        \nCompany\u2019s loan portfolio include jumbo        \nmortgages and branch-originated first lien    \nhome equity loans to borrowers with high      \ncredit quality. Credit card loans increased   \n$1.2 billion (5.3 percent) at June 30, 2022,  \ncompared with December 31, 2021, reflecting   \nincreased consumer spending and new account   \ngrowth. Commercial real estate loans increased\n$700 million (1.8 percent) at June 30, 2022,  \ncompared with December 31, 2021, primarily the\nresult of new originations. Other retail loans\ndecreased $1.1 billion (1.8 percent) at June  \n30, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, due\nto decreases in auto loans and retail leasing \nbalances, partially offset by an increase in  \nhome equity loans.                            \n                                  \n  Table\u00a03    Noninterest Expense  \n                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                     \n  *  Not meaningful  \n                     \n                                              \n  a)  SeeNon-GAAPFinancial Measures           \n      beginning on page 31.                   \n                                              \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    7  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                    \n  Table\u00a04    Investment Securities  \n                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Information related to asset and       \n       mortgage-backed securities included    \n  (a)  above is presented based upon          \n       weighted-average maturities that take  \n       into account anticipated future        \n       prepayments.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Information related to obligations of  \n       state and political subdivisions is    \n       presented based upon yield to first    \n  (b)  optional call date if the security is  \n       purchased at a premium, and yield to   \n       maturity if the security is purchased  \n       at par or a discount.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Maturity calculations for obligations  \n       of state and political subdivisions    \n       are based on the first optional call   \n  (c)  date for securities with a fair value  \n       above par and the contractual          \n       maturity date for securities with a    \n       fair value equal to or below par.      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Yields on investment securities are    \n       computed based on amortized cost       \n       balances. Weighted-average yields for  \n  (d)  obligations of state and political     \n       subdivisions are presented on a        \n       fully-taxable equivalent basis based   \n       on a federal income tax rate of 21\u00a0    \n       percent.                               \n                                              \nThe Company generally retains portfolio loans \nthrough maturity; however, the Company\u2019s      \nintent may change over time based upon various\nfactors such as ongoing asset/liability       \nmanagement activities, assessment of product  \nprofitability, credit risk, liquidity needs,  \nand capital implications. If the Company\u2019s    \nintent or ability to hold an existing         \nportfolio loan changes, it is transferred to  \nloans held for sale. Loans Held for Sale Loans\nheld for sale, consisting primarily of        \nresidential mortgages to be sold in the       \nsecondary market, were $3.9 billion at June   \n30, 2022, compared with $7.8 billion at       \nDecember 31, 2021. The decrease in loans held \nfor sale was principally due to a lower level \nof mortgage loan closings in the second       \nquarter of 2022, compared with the fourth     \nquarter of 2021. Almost all of the residential\nmortgage loans the Company originates or      \npurchases for sale follow guidelines that     \nallow the loans to be sold into existing,     \nhighly liquid secondary markets, in particular\nin government agency transactions and to      \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d).    \nInvestment Securities Investment securities   \ntotaled $160.3 billion at June 30, 2022,      \ncompared with $174.8 billion at December 31,  \n2021. The $14.5 billion (8.3 percent) decrease\nwas primarily due to an $11.4 billion         \nunfavorable change in net unrealized gains    \n(losses) on available-for-saleinvestment      \nsecurities and $2.3 billion of net investment \nsales and maturities. During the second       \nquarter of 2022, the Company transferred $17.1\nbillion amortized cost ($15.7 billion fair    \nvalue) of available-for-saleinvestment        \nsecurities to the held-to-maturitycategory to \nreflect its new intent for these securities.  \nSubsequent to June 30, 2022, the Company      \ntransferred an additional $19.8 billion       \namortized cost ($17.6 billion fair value) of  \navailable-for-sale investment securities to   \nthe held-to-maturity category. The Company\u2019s  \navailable-for-saleinvestment securities are   \ncarried at fair value with changes in fair    \nvalue reflected in other comprehensive income \n(loss) unless a portion of a security\u2019s       \nunrealized loss is related to credit and an   \nallowance for credit losses is necessary. At  \nJune 30, 2022, the Company\u2019s net unrealized   \nlosses on available-for-saleinvestment        \nsecurities were $9.4 billion, compared with   \n$722 million of net unrealized gains at       \nDecember 31, 2021. The unfavorable change in  \nnet unrealized gains (losses) was primarily   \ndue to decreases in the fair value of         \nmortgage-backed, U.S. Treasury and state and  \npolitical securities as a result of changes in\ninterest rates, partially offset by the impact\nof the transfer of available-for-             \nsaleinvestment securities to the held-to-     \nmaturitycategory. Gross unrealized losses on  \navailable-for-saleinvestment securities       \ntotaled $9.5 billion at June 30, 2022,        \ncompared with $812 million at December 31,    \n2021. At June 30, 2022, the Company had no    \nplans to sell securities with unrealized      \nlosses, and believed it is more likely than   \nnot that it would not be required to sell such\nsecurities before recovery of their amortized \ncost. Refer to Notes 4 and 15 in the Notes to \nConsolidated Financial Statements for further \ninformation on investment securities. Deposits\nTotal deposits were $467.1 billion at June 30,\n2022, compared with $456.1 billion at December\n31, 2021.

Savings account balances increased  \n$2.3 billion (3.4 percent), driven by higher  \nConsumer and Business Banking balances.       \nInterest checking balances decreased $2.4     \nbillion (2.0 percent), primarily due to lower \nWealth Management and Investment Services     \nbalances, partially offset by higher Corporate\nand Commercial Banking, and Consumer and      \nBusiness Banking balances. Time deposits      \nincreased $8.0 billion (35.1 percent) at June \n30, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021,    \ndriven by higher Corporate and Commercial     \nBanking balances, partially offset by lower   \nConsumer and Business Banking balances.       \nChanges in time deposits are primarily related\nto those deposits managed as an alternative to\nother funding sources, based largely on       \nrelative pricing and liquidity                \ncharacteristics. Noninterest-bearing deposits \ndecreased $5.8 billion (4.3 percent) at June  \n30, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021,    \nprimarily due to lower Corporate and          \nCommercial Banking balances, partially offset \nby higher Wealth Management and Investment    \nServices balances. Borrowings The Company     \nutilizes both short-term and long-term        \nborrowings as part of its asset/liability     \nmanagement and funding strategies. Short-term \nborrowings, which include federal funds       \npurchased, commercial paper, repurchase       \nagreements, borrowings secured by high-grade  \nassets and other short-term borrowings, were  \n$25.0 billion at June 30, 2022, compared with \n$11.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The $13.2 \nbillion increase in short-term borrowings was \nprimarily due to increases in short-term      \nFederal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) advances and  \ncommercial paper balances. Long-term debt was \n$29.4 billion at June 30, 2022, compared with \n$32.1 billion at December 31, 2021. The $2.7  \nbillion (8.5 percent) decrease was primarily  \ndue to $2.6 billion of bank note repayments   \nand maturities, $1.3 billion of subordinated  \nnote repayments and $1.0 billion of medium-   \nterm note repayments, partially offset by $2.1\nbillion of medium-term note issuances. Refer  \nto the \u201cLiquidity Risk Management\u201d section for\ndiscussion of liquidity management of the     \nCompany. CORPORATE RISK PROFILE Overview      \nManaging risks is an essential part of        \nsuccessfully operating a financial services   \ncompany. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors has \napproved a risk management framework which    \nestablishes governance and risk management    \nrequirements for all risk-taking activities.  \nThis framework includes Company and business  \nline risk appetite statements which set       \nboundaries for the types and amount of risk   \nthat may be undertaken in pursuing business   \nobjectives and initiatives. The Board of      \nDirectors, primarily through its Risk         \nManagement Committee, oversees performance    \nrelative to the risk management framework,    \nrisk appetite statements, and other policy    \nrequirements. The Executive Risk Committee    \n(\u201cERC\u201d), which is chaired by the Chief Risk   \nOfficer and includes the Chief Executive      \nOfficer and other members of the executive    \nmanagement team, oversees execution against   \nthe risk management framework and risk        \nappetite statements. The ERC focuses on       \ncurrent and emerging risks, including         \nstrategic and reputation risks, by directing  \ntimely and comprehensive actions. Senior      \noperating committees have also been           \nestablished, each responsible for overseeing a\nspecified category of risk. The Company\u2019s most\nprominent risk exposures are credit, interest \nrate, market, liquidity, operational,         \ncompliance, strategic, and reputation. Credit \nrisk is the risk of loss associated with a    \nchange in the credit profile or the failure of\na borrower or counterparty to meet its        \ncontractual obligations. Interest rate risk is\nthe current or prospective risk to earnings   \nand capital, or market valuations, arising    \nfrom the impact of changes in interest rates. \nMarket risk arises from fluctuations in       \ninterest rates, foreign exchange rates, and   \nsecurity prices that may result in changes in \nthe values of financial instruments, such as  \ntrading and available-for-salesecurities,     \nmortgage loans held for sale (\u201cMLHFS\u201d), MSRs  \nand derivatives that are accounted for on a   \nfair value basis. Liquidity risk is the risk  \nthat financial condition or overall safety and\nsoundness is adversely affected by the        \nCompany\u2019s inability, or perceived inability,  \nto meet its cash flow obligations in a timely \nand complete manner in either normal or       \nstressed conditions. Operational risk is the  \nrisk to current or projected financial        \ncondition and resilience arising from         \ninadequate or failed internal processes or    \nsystems, people (including human errors or    \nmisconduct), or adverse external events,      \nincluding the risk of loss resulting from     \nbreaches in data security. Operational risk   \ncan also include the risk of loss due to      \nfailures by third parties with which the      \nCompany does business. Compliance risk is the \nrisk that the Company may suffer legal or     \nregulatory sanctions, financial losses, and   \nreputational damage if it fails to adhere to  \ncompliance requirements and the Company\u2019s     \ncompliance policies. Strategic risk is the    \nrisk to current or projected financial        \ncondition and resilience arising from adverse \nbusiness decisions, poor implementation of    \nbusiness decisions, or                        \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    9  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nlack of responsiveness to changes in the      \nbanking industry and operating environment.   \nReputation risk is the risk to current or     \nanticipated earnings, capital, or franchise or\nenterprise value arising from negative public \nopinion. This risk may impair the Company\u2019s   \ncompetitiveness by affecting its ability to   \nestablish new relationships or services, or   \ncontinue serving existing relationships. In   \naddition to the risks identified above, other \nrisk factors exist that may impact the        \nCompany. Refer to \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in the       \nCompany\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor the   \nyear ended December 31, 2021, for a detailed  \ndiscussion of these factors. The Company\u2019s    \nBoard and management-level governance         \ncommittees are supported by a \u201cthree lines of \ndefense\u201d model for establishing effective     \nchecks and balances. The first line of        \ndefense, the business lines, manages risks in \nconformity with established limits and policy \nrequirements. In turn, business line leaders  \nand their risk officers establish programs to \nensure conformity with these limits and policy\nrequirements. The second line of defense,     \nwhich includes the Chief Risk Officer\u2019s       \norganization as well as policy and oversight  \nactivities of corporate support functions,    \ntranslates risk appetite and strategy into    \nactionable risk limits and policies.

In  \nevaluating its credit risk, the Company       \nconsiders changes, if any, in underwriting    \nactivities, the loan portfolio composition    \n(including product mix and geographic,        \nindustry or customer-specific concentrations),\ncollateral values, trends in loan performance \nand macroeconomic factors, such as changes in \nunemployment rates, gross domestic product    \nlevels and consumer bankruptcy filings. The   \nRisk Management Committee oversees the        \nCompany\u2019s credit risk management process. In  \naddition, credit quality ratings as defined by\nthe Company are an important part of the      \nCompany\u2019s overall credit risk management and  \nevaluation of its allowance for credit losses.\nLoans with a pass rating represent those loans\nnot classified on the Company\u2019s rating scale  \nfor problem credits, as minimal credit risk   \nhas been identified. Loans with a special     \nmention or classified rating, including       \nconsumer lending and small business loans that\nare 90 days or more past due and still        \naccruing, nonaccrual loans, those loans       \nconsidered troubled debt restructurings       \n(\u201cTDRs\u201d), and loans in a junior lien position \nthat are current but are behind a first lien  \nposition on nonaccrual, encompass all loans   \nheld by the Company that it considers to have \na potential or well-defined weakness that may \nput full collection of contractual cash flows \nat risk. The Company\u2019s internal credit quality\nratings for consumer loans are primarily based\non delinquency and nonperforming status,      \nexcept for a limited population of larger     \nloans within those portfolios that are        \nindividually evaluated. For this limited      \npopulation, the determination of the internal \ncredit quality rating may also consider       \ncollateral value and customer cash flows.     \nRefer to Note 5 in the Notes to               \n                      \n  10    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nConsolidated Financial Statements for further \ndiscussion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolios   \nincluding internal credit quality ratings. In \naddition, refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion   \nand Analysis \u2014 Credit Risk Management\u201d in the \nCompany\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor the   \nyear ended December 31, 2021, for a more      \ndetailed discussion on credit risk management \nprocesses. The Company manages its credit     \nrisk, in part, through diversification of its \nloan portfolio which is achieved through limit\nsetting by product type criteria, such as     \nindustry, and identification of credit        \nconcentrations. As part of its normal business\nactivities, the Company offers a broad array  \nof lending products. The Company categorizes  \nits loan portfolio into two segments, which is\nthe level at which it develops and documents a\nsystematic methodology to determine the       \nallowance for credit losses. The Company\u2019s two\nloan portfolio segments are commercial lending\nand consumer lending. The commercial lending  \nsegment includes loans and leases made to     \nsmall business, middle market, large          \ncorporate, commercial real estate, financial  \ninstitution, non-profitand public sector      \ncustomers. Key risk characteristics relevant  \nto commercial lending segment loans include   \nthe industry and geography of the borrower\u2019s  \nbusiness, purpose of the loan, repayment      \nsource, borrower\u2019s debt capacity and financial\nflexibility, loan covenants, and nature of    \npledged collateral, if any, as well as        \nmacroeconomic factors such as unemployment    \nrates, gross domestic product levels,         \ncorporate bond spreads and long-term interest \nrates. These risk characteristics, among      \nothers, are considered in determining         \nestimates about the likelihood of default by  \nthe borrowers and the severity of loss in the \nevent of default. The Company considers these \nrisk characteristics in assigning internal    \nrisk ratings to, or forecasting losses on,    \nthese loans, which are the significant factors\nin determining the allowance for credit losses\nfor loans in the commercial lending segment.  \nThe consumer lending segment represents loans \nand leases made to consumer customers,        \nincluding residential mortgages, credit card  \nloans, and other retail loans such as         \nrevolving consumer lines, auto loans and      \nleases, home equity loans and lines, and      \nstudent loans, a run-offportfolio. Home equity\nor second mortgage loans are junior lien      \nclosed-endaccounts fully disbursed at         \norigination. These loans typically are fixed  \nrate loans, secured by residential real       \nestate, with a 10-or 15-yearfixed payment     \namortization schedule. Home equity lines are  \nrevolving accounts giving the borrower the    \nability to draw and repay balances repeatedly,\nup to a maximum commitment, and are secured by\nresidential real estate. These include        \naccounts in either a first or junior lien     \nposition. Typical terms on home equity lines  \nin the portfolio are variable rates           \nbenchmarked to the prime rate, with a 10-or   \n15-yeardraw period during which a minimum     \npayment is equivalent to the monthly interest,\nfollowed by a 20-or 10-yearamortization       \nperiod, respectively. At June 30, 2022,       \nsubstantially all of the Company\u2019s home equity\nlines were in the draw period. Key risk       \ncharacteristics relevant to consumer lending  \nsegment loans primarily relate to the         \nborrowers\u2019 capacity and willingness to repay  \nand include unemployment rates, consumer      \nbankruptcy filings and other macroeconomic    \nfactors, customer payment history and credit  \nscores, and in some cases, updated loan-to-   \nvalue(\u201cLTV\u201d) information reflecting current   \nmarket conditions on real estate-based loans. \nThese and other risk characteristics are      \nreflected in forecasts of delinquency levels, \nbankruptcies and losses which are the primary \nfactors in determining the allowance for      \ncredit losses for the consumer lending        \nsegment. The Company further disaggregates its\nloan portfolio segments into various classes  \nbased on their underlying risk                \ncharacteristics. The two classes within the   \ncommercial lending segment are commercial     \nloans and commercial real estate loans. The   \nthree classes within the consumer lending     \nsegment are residential mortgages, credit card\nloans and other retail loans. The Company\u2019s   \nconsumer lending segment utilizes several     \ndistinct business processes and channels to   \noriginate consumer credit, including          \ntraditional branch lending, mobile and on-    \nlinebanking, indirect lending, alliance       \npartnerships and correspondent banks. Each    \ndistinct underwriting and origination activity\nmanages unique credit risk characteristics and\nprices its loan production commensurate with  \nthe differing risk profiles. Residential      \nmortgage originations are generally limited to\nprime borrowers and are performed through the \nCompany\u2019s branches, loan production offices,  \nmobile and on-lineservices and a wholesale    \nnetwork of originators. The Company may retain\nresidential mortgage loans it originates on   \nits balance sheet or sell the loans into the  \nsecondary market while retaining the servicing\nrights and customer relationships. Utilizing  \nthe secondary markets enables the Company to  \neffectively reduce its credit and other       \nasset/liability risks. For residential        \nmortgages that are retained in the Company\u2019s  \nportfolio and for home equity and second      \nmortgages, credit risk is also diversified by \ngeography and managed by adherence to LTV and \nborrower credit criteria during the           \nunderwriting process. The Company estimates   \nupdated LTV information on its outstanding    \nresidential mortgages quarterly, based on a   \nmethod that combines automated valuation model\nupdates and relevant home price indices. LTV  \nis the ratio of the loan\u2019s outstanding        \nprincipal balance to the current estimate of  \nproperty value.

Certain   \nloans do not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily   \ndue to lack of availability of relevant       \nautomated valuation model and/or home price   \nindices values, or lack of necessary valuation\ndata on acquired loans.

        \nRestructured Loans In certain circumstances,  \nthe Company may modify the terms of a loan to \nmaximize the collection of amounts due when a \nborrower is experiencing financial            \ndifficulties or is expected to experience     \ndifficulties in the near-term. In most cases  \nthe modification is either a concessionary    \nreduction in interest rate, extension of the  \nmaturity date or reduction in the principal   \nbalance that would otherwise not be           \nconsidered. Troubled Debt Restructurings      \nConcessionary modifications are classified as \nTDRs unless the modification results in only  \nan insignificant delay in the payments to be  \nreceived. TDRs accrue interest if the borrower\ncomplies with the revised terms and conditions\nand has demonstrated repayment performance at \na level commensurate with the modified terms  \nover several payment cycles, which is         \ngenerally six months or greater. At June 30,  \n2022, performing TDRs were $3.2 billion,      \ncompared with $3.1 billion at December 31,    \n2021. The Company continues to work with      \ncustomers to modify loans for borrowers who   \nare experiencing financial difficulties. Many \nof the Company\u2019s TDRs are determined on a     \ncase-by-casebasis in connection with ongoing  \nloan collection processes. The modifications  \nvary within each of the Company\u2019s loan        \nclasses. Commercial lending segment TDRs      \ngenerally include extensions of the maturity  \ndate and may be accompanied by an increase or \ndecrease to the interest rate. The Company may\nalso work with the borrower to make other     \nchanges to the loan to mitigate losses, such  \nas obtaining additional collateral and/or     \nguarantees to support the loan. The Company   \nhas also implemented certain residential      \nmortgage loan restructuring programs that may \nresult in TDRs. The Company modifies          \nresidential mortgage loans under Federal      \nHousing Administration, United States         \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and its own   \ninternal programs. Under these programs, the  \nCompany offers qualifying homeowners the      \nopportunity to permanently modify their loan  \nand achieve more affordable monthly payments  \nby providing loan concessions. These          \nconcessions may include adjustments to        \ninterest rates, conversion of adjustable rates\nto fixed rates, extensions of maturity dates  \nor deferrals of payments, capitalization of   \naccrued interest and/or outstanding advances, \nor in limited situations, partial forgiveness \nof loan principal. In most instances,         \nparticipation in residential mortgage loan    \nrestructuring programs requires the customer  \nto complete a short-term trial period. A      \npermanent loan modification is contingent on  \nthe customer successfully completing the trial\nperiod arrangement, and the loan documents are\nnot modified until that time. The Company     \nreports loans in a trial period arrangement as\nTDRs and continues to report them as TDRs     \nafter the trial period. Credit card and other \nretail loan TDRs are generally part of        \ndistinct restructuring programs providing     \ncustomers modification solutions over a       \nspecified time period, generally up to 60     \nmonths. In accordance with regulatory         \nguidance, the Company considers secured       \nconsumer loans that have had debt discharged  \nthrough bankruptcy where the borrower has not \nreaffirmed the debt to be TDRs. If the loan   \namount exceeds the collateral value, the loan \nis charged down to collateral value and the   \nremaining amount is reported as nonperforming.\nThe following table provides a summary of TDRs\nby loan class, including the delinquency      \nstatus for TDRs that continue to accrue       \ninterest and TDRs included in nonperforming   \nassets:

   \n                                              \nShort-term and Other Loan Modifications The   \nCompany makes short-term and other            \nmodifications that it does not consider to be \nTDRs, in limited circumstances, to assist     \nborrowers experiencing temporary hardships,   \nincluding previously offering payment relief  \nto borrowers that experienced financial       \nhardship resulting directly from the effects  \nof the COVID-19pandemic. Short-term consumer  \nlending modification programs include payment \nreductions, deferrals of up to three past due \npayments, and the ability to return to current\nstatus if the borrower makes required         \npayments. The Company may also make short-term\nmodifications to commercial lending loans,    \nwith the most common modification being an    \nextension of the maturity date of three months\nor less. Such extensions generally are used   \nwhen the maturity date is imminent and the    \nborrower is experiencing some level of        \nfinancial stress, but the Company believes the\nborrower will pay all contractual amounts     \nowed. Nonperforming Assets The level of       \nnonperforming assets represents another       \nindicator of the potential for future credit  \nlosses. Nonperforming assets include          \nnonaccrual loans, restructured loans not      \nperforming in accordance with modified terms  \nand not accruing interest, restructured loans \nthat have not met the performance period      \nrequired to return to accrual status, other   \nreal estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d) and other          \nnonperforming assets owned by the Company.    \nInterest payments collected from assets on    \nnonaccrual status are generally applied       \nagainst the principal balance and not recorded\nas income. However, interest income may be    \nrecognized for interest payments if the       \nremaining carrying amount of the loan is      \nbelieved to be collectible. At June 30, 2022, \ntotal nonperforming assets were $770 million, \ncompared to $878 million at December 31, 2021.\nThe $108 million (12.3 percent) decrease in   \nnonperforming assets was driven by a decrease \nin nonperforming commercial real estate and   \ncommercial loans. The ratio of total          \nnonperforming assets to total loans and other \nreal estate was 0.23 percent at June 30, 2022,\ncompared with 0.28 percent at December 31,    \n2021. OREO was $23 million at June 30, 2022,  \ncompared with $22 million at December 31,     \n2021, and was related to foreclosed properties\nthat previously secured loan balances. These  \nbalances exclude foreclosed GNMA loans whose  \nrepayments are primarily insured by the       \nFederal Housing Administration or guaranteed  \nby the United States Department of Veterans   \nAffairs.                                      \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    15  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents

\nnet charge-offs were $161 million for the     \nsecond quarter and $323 million for the first \nsix months of 2022, compared with $180 million\nand $403 million, respectively, for the same  \nperiods of 2021. The year-over-year decreases \nin net charge-offs were primarily driven by   \nlower credit card net charge-offs. The ratio  \nof total loan net charge-offs to average loans\noutstanding on an annualized basis for both   \nthe second quarter and first six months of    \n2022 was 0.20 percent, compared with 0.25     \npercent and 0.28 percent, respectively, for   \nthe same periods of 2021. Analysis and        \nDetermination of the Allowance for Credit     \nLosses The allowance for credit losses is     \nestablished for current expected credit losses\non the Company\u2019s loan and lease portfolio,    \nincluding unfunded credit commitments. The    \nallowance considers expected losses for the   \nremaining lives of the applicable assets,     \ninclusive of expected recoveries. The         \nallowance for credit losses is increased      \nthrough provisions charged to earnings and    \nreduced by net charge-offs. Management        \nevaluates the appropriateness of the allowance\nfor credit losses on a quarterly basis.       \nMultiple economic scenarios are considered    \nover a three-year reasonable and supportable  \nforecast period, which includes increasing    \nconsideration of historical loss experience   \nover years two and three. These economic      \nscenarios are constructed with interrelated   \nprojections of multiple economic variables,   \nand loss estimates are produced that consider \nthe historical correlation of those economic  \nvariables with credit losses. After the       \nforecast period, the Company fully reverts to \nlong-term historical                          \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    17  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nloss experience, adjusted for prepayments and \ncharacteristics of the current loan and lease \nportfolio, to estimate losses over the        \nremaining life of the portfolio. The economic \nscenarios are updated at least quarterly and  \nare designed to provide a range of reasonable \nestimates from better to worse than current   \nexpectations. Scenarios are weighted based on \nthe Company\u2019s expectation of economic         \nconditions for the foreseeable future and     \nreflect significant judgment and consideration\nof economic forecast uncertainty. Final loss  \nestimates also consider factors affecting     \ncredit losses not reflected in the scenarios, \ndue to the unique aspects of current          \nconditions and expectations. These factors may\ninclude, but are not limited to, loan         \nservicing practices, regulatory guidance,     \nand/or fiscal and monetary policy actions.    \nBecause business processes and credit risks   \nassociated with unfunded credit commitments   \nare essentially the same as for loans, the    \nCompany utilizes similar processes to estimate\nits liability for unfunded credit commitments,\nwhich is included in other liabilities in the \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Both the allowance\nfor loan losses and the liability for unfunded\ncredit commitments are included in the        \nCompany\u2019s analysis of credit losses and       \nreported reserve ratios. The allowance        \nrecorded for credit losses utilizes forward-  \nlooking expected loss models to consider a    \nvariety of factors affecting lifetime credit  \nlosses. These factors include, but are not    \nlimited to, macroeconomic variables such as   \nunemployment rates, real estate prices, gross \ndomestic product levels and corporate bond    \nspreads, as well as loan and borrower         \ncharacteristics, such as internal risk ratings\non commercial loans and consumer credit       \nscores, delinquency status, collateral type   \nand available valuation information,          \nconsideration of end-of-termlosses on lease   \nresiduals, and the remaining term of the loan,\nadjusted for expected prepayments. For each   \nloan portfolio, model estimates are adjusted  \nas necessary to consider any relevant changes \nin portfolio composition, lending policies,   \nunderwriting standards, risk management       \npractices, economic conditions or other       \nfactors that may affect the accuracy of the   \nmodel. Expected credit loss estimates also    \ninclude consideration of expected cash        \nrecoveries on loans previously charged-offor  \nexpected recoveries on collateral-dependent   \nloans where recovery is expected through sale \nof the collateral. Where loans do not exhibit \nsimilar risk characteristics, an individual   \nanalysis is performed to consider expected    \ncredit losses. The allowance recorded for     \nindividually evaluated loans greater than $5  \nmillion in the commercial lending segment is  \nbased on an analysis utilizing expected cash  \nflows discounted using the original effective \ninterest rate, the observable market price of \nthe loan, or the fair value of the collateral,\nless selling costs, for collateral-dependent  \nloans as appropriate. For commercial TDRs     \nindividually evaluated for impairment,        \nattributes of the borrower are the primary    \nfactors in determining the allowance for      \ncredit losses. For smaller commercial loans   \ncollectively evaluated for impairment,        \nhistorical loss experience is also            \nincorporated into the allowance methodology   \napplied to this category of loans. The        \nallowance recorded for TDR loans in the       \nconsumer lending segment is determined on a   \nhomogenous pool basis utilizing expected cash \nflows discounted using the original effective \ninterest rate of the pool. The expected cash  \nflows on TDR loans consider subsequent payment\ndefaults since modification, the borrower\u2019s   \nability to pay under the restructured terms,  \nand the timing and amount of payments. The    \nallowance for collateral-dependent loans in   \nthe consumer lending segment is determined    \nbased on the current fair value of the        \ncollateral less costs to sell. When evaluating\nthe appropriateness of the allowance for      \ncredit losses for any loans and lines in a    \njunior lien position, the Company considers   \nthe delinquency and modification status of the\nfirst lien. At June 30, 2022, the Company     \nserviced the first lien on 34 percent of the  \nhome equity loans and lines in a junior lien  \nposition. The Company also considers the      \nstatus of first lien mortgage accounts        \nreported on customer credit bureau files when \nthe first lien is not serviced by the Company.\nRegardless of whether the Company services the\nfirst lien, an assessment is made of economic \nconditions, problem loans, recent loss        \nexperience and other factors in determining   \nthe allowance for credit losses. Based on the \navailable information, the Company estimated  \n$193 million or 1.8 percent of its total home \nequity portfolio at June 30, 2022, represented\nnon-delinquentjunior liens where the first    \nlien was delinquent or modified. The Company  \nconsiders historical loss experience on the   \nloans and lines in a junior lien position to  \nestablish loss estimates for junior lien loans\nand lines the Company services that are       \ncurrent, but the first lien is delinquent or  \nmodified. The historical long-term average    \nloss experience related to junior liens has   \nbeen relatively limited (less than 1 percent  \nof the total portfolio annually), and         \nestimates are adjusted to consider current    \ncollateral support and portfolio risk         \ncharacteristics. These include updated credit \nscores and collateral estimates obtained on   \nthe Company\u2019s home equity portfolio each      \nquarter. In its evaluation of the allowance   \nfor credit losses, the Company also considers \nthe increased risk of loss associated with    \nhome equity lines that are contractually      \nscheduled to convert from a revolving status  \nto a fully amortizing payment.                \n                      \n  18    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nWhen a loan portfolio is purchased, the       \nacquired loans are divided into those         \nconsidered purchased with more than           \ninsignificant credit deterioration (\u201cPCD\u201d) and\nthose not considered PCD. An allowance is     \nestablished for each population and considers \nproduct mix, risk characteristics of the      \nportfolio, bankruptcy experience, delinquency \nstatus and refreshed LTV ratios when possible.\nThe allowance established for purchased loans \nnot considered PCD is recognized through      \nprovision expense upon acquisition, whereas   \nthe allowance established for loans considered\nPCD at acquisition is offset by an increase in\nthe basis of the acquired loans. Any          \nsubsequent increases and decreases in the     \nallowance related to purchased loans,         \nregardless of PCD status, are recognized      \nthrough provision expense, with charge-offs   \ncharged to the allowance. The Company did not \nhave a material amount of PCD loans included  \nin its loan portfolio at June 30, 2022. The   \nCompany\u2019s methodology for determining the     \nappropriate allowance for credit losses also  \nconsiders the imprecision inherent in the     \nmethodologies used and allocated to the       \nvarious loan portfolios. As a result, amounts \ndetermined under the methodologies described  \nabove are adjusted by management to consider  \nthe potential impact of other qualitative     \nfactors not captured in quantitative model    \nadjustments which include, but are not limited\nto, the following: model imprecision,         \nimprecision in economic scenario assumptions, \nand emerging risks related to either changes  \nin the economic environment that are affecting\nspecific portfolios, or changes in portfolio  \nconcentrations over time that may affect model\nperformance. The consideration of these items \nresults in adjustments to allowance amounts   \nincluded in the Company\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses for each loan portfolio. Although the  \nCompany determined the amount of each element \nof the allowance separately and considers this\nprocess to be an important credit management  \ntool, the entire allowance for credit losses  \nis available for the entire loan portfolio.   \nThe actual amount of losses can vary          \nsignificantly from the estimated amounts. At  \nJune 30, 2022, the allowance for credit losses\nwas $6.3 billion (1.88 percent of period-     \nendloans), compared with an allowance of $6.2 \nbillion (1.97 percent of period-endloans) at  \nDecember 31, 2021. The ratio of the allowance \nfor credit losses to nonperforming loans was  \n863 percent at June 30, 2022, compared with   \n738 percent at December 31, 2021. The ratio of\nthe allowance for credit losses to annualized \nloan net charge-offs was 969 percent at June  \n30, 2022, compared with 902 percent of full   \nyear 2021 net charge-offs at December 31,     \n2021. The increase in the allowance for credit\nlosses of $100 million (1.6 percent) at June  \n30, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, was\ndriven by strong loan growth and increased    \neconomic uncertainty, partially offset by     \nstabilizing credit quality. Economic          \nuncertainty and recession risk has been       \nincreasing due to ongoing supply chain        \nchallenges, rising inflationary concerns,     \nmarket volatility, rising oil prices resulting\nfrom the Russia-Ukraine conflict and, to a    \nlesser extent, additional COVID-19virus       \nvariants. In addition to these factors,       \nexpected loss estimates consider various      \nfactors including customer specific           \ninformation impacting changes in risk ratings,\nprojected delinquencies, potential effects of \ninflationary pressures and the impact of      \nrising interest rates on borrowers\u2019 liquidity \nand ability to repay. Economic conditions     \nconsidered in estimating the allowance for    \ncredit losses at June 30, 2022 included       \nchanges in projected gross domestic product   \nand unemployment levels. These factors are    \nevaluated through a combination of            \nquantitative calculations using economic      \nscenarios and qualitative assessments that    \nconsider the high degree of economic          \nuncertainty in the current environment. The   \nfollowing table summarizes the baseline       \nforecast for key economic variables the       \nCompany used in its estimate of the allowance \nfor credit losses at June 30, 2022 and        \nDecember 31, 2021:                            \n                                              \n                                 December     \n               June\u00a030,               31,     \n                   2022              2021     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  United                                      \n  States                                      \n  unemploy\u2026                                   \n  rate for                                    \n  the                                         \n  three                                       \n  months                                      \n  ending                                      \n  (a)                                         \n  June\u00a030,          3.6  %            3.6  %  \n  2022                                        \n  September         3.4               3.5     \n  30, 2022                                    \n  December\u00a0         3.3               3.5     \n  31, 2022                                    \n  United                                      \n  States                                      \n  real                                        \n  gross                                       \n  domestic                                    \n  product                                     \n  for the                                     \n  three                                       \n  months                                      \n  ending                                      \n  (b)                                         \n  June\u00a030,          2.5  %            4.4  %  \n  2022                                        \n  September         2.8               4.5     \n  30, 2022                                    \n  December\u00a0         1.8               3.4     \n  31, 2022                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Reflects quarterly average of          \n  (a)  forecasted reported United States      \n       unemployment rate.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  (b)  Reflects year-over-year growth rates.  \n                                              \nThe allowance for credit losses related to    \ncommercial lending segment loans decreased    \n$103 million during the first six months of   \n2022, reflecting select commercial portfolios \ncontinuing to recover from the effects of the \nCOVID-19pandemic, partially offset by the     \nimpacts of loan growth and rising economic    \nuncertainty.

of its  \nleased assets, regular residual asset         \nvaluation reviews and monitoring of residual  \nvalue gains or losses upon the disposition of \nassets. As of June 30, 2022, no significant   \nchange in the amount of residual values or    \nconcentration of the portfolios had occurred  \nsince December 31, 2021.

Operational risk is   \ninherent in all business activities, and the  \nmanagement of this risk is important to the   \nachievement of the Company\u2019s objectives.      \nBusiness lines have direct and primary        \nresponsibility and accountability for         \nidentifying, controlling, and monitoring      \noperational risks embedded in their business  \nactivities, including those additional or     \nincreased risks created by economic and       \nfinancial disruptions. The Company maintains a\nsystem of controls with the objective of      \nproviding proper transaction authorization and\nexecution, proper system operations, proper   \noversight of third parties with whom it does  \nbusiness, safeguarding of assets from misuse  \nor theft, and ensuring the reliability and    \nsecurity of financial and other data.

Compliance Risk  \nManagement The Company may suffer legal or    \nregulatory sanctions, material financial loss,\nor damage to its reputation through failure to\ncomply with laws, regulations, rules,         \nstandards of good practice, and codes of      \nconduct, including those related to compliance\nwith Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering   \nrequirements, sanctions compliance            \nrequirements as administered by the Office of \nForeign Assets Control, consumer protection   \nand other requirements. The Company has       \ncontrols and processes in place for the       \nassessment, identification, monitoring,       \nmanagement and reporting of compliance risks  \nand issues including those created or         \nincreased by economic and financial           \ndisruptions.

The    \nCompany manages its exposure to changes in    \ninterest rates through asset and liability    \nmanagement activities within guidelines       \nestablished by its Asset Liability Management \nCommittee (\u201cALCO\u201d) and approved by the Board  \nof Directors. The ALCO has the responsibility \nfor approving and overseeing compliance with  \nthe ALCO management policies, including       \ninterest rate risk exposure. One way the      \nCompany measures and analyzes its interest    \nrate risk is through net interest income      \nsimulation analysis. Simulation analysis      \nincorporates substantially all of the         \nCompany\u2019s assets and liabilities and off-     \nbalancesheet instruments, together with       \nforecasted changes in the balance sheet and   \nassumptions that reflect the current interest \nrate environment. Through this simulation,    \nmanagement estimates the impact on net        \ninterest income of various interest rate      \nchanges that differ in the direction, amount  \nand speed of change over time, as well as the \nshape of the yield curve. This simulation     \nincludes assumptions about how the balance    \nsheet is likely to be affected by changes in  \nloan and deposit growth. Assumptions are made \nto project interest rates for new loans and   \ndeposits based on historical analysis,        \nmanagement\u2019s outlook and re-pricingstrategies.\nThese assumptions are reviewed and validated  \non a periodic basis with sensitivity analysis \nbeing provided for key variables of the       \nsimulation. The results are reviewed monthly  \nby the ALCO and are used to guide             \nasset/liability management strategies. The    \nCompany manages its interest rate risk        \nposition by holding assets with desired       \ninterest rate risk characteristics on its     \nbalance sheet, implementing certain pricing   \nstrategies for loans and deposits and         \nselecting derivatives and various funding and \ninvestment portfolio strategies. Table 9      \nsummarizes the projected impact to net        \ninterest income over the next 12 months of    \nvarious potential interest rate changes. The  \nsensitivity of the projected impact to net    \ninterest income over the next 12 months is    \ndependent on balance sheet growth, product    \nmix, deposit behavior, pricing and funding    \ndecisions. While the Company utilizes models  \nand assumptions based on historical           \ninformation and expected behaviors, actual    \noutcomes could vary significantly. Net        \ninterest income sensitivities reflect the     \nimpact of current market expectations for     \ninterest rates, driving an increase in        \nbaseline projected net interest income. As    \nmarket expectations are reflected in projected\nresults, incremental interest rate sensitivity\ndeclines on a percentage basis.               \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    21  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table\u00a09    Sensitivity of Net Interest      \n             Income                           \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  *  Given the level of interest rates,       \n     downward rate scenario is not computed.  \n                                              \nUse of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and\nOther Risks To manage the sensitivity of      \nearnings and capital to interest rate,        \nprepayment, credit, price and foreign currency\nfluctuations (asset and liability management  \npositions), the Company enters into derivative\ntransactions. The Company uses derivatives for\nasset and liability management purposes       \nprimarily in the following ways:              \n                                              \n       To convert fixed-rate debt             \n  \u2022    andavailable-for-saleinvestment        \n       securities from fixed-rate payments    \n       to floating-rate payments;             \n                                              \n                                              \n       To convert floating-rate loans and     \n  \u2022    debt from floating-rate payments to    \n       fixed-rate payments;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate changes in value of the    \n  \u2022    Company\u2019s unfunded mortgage loan       \n       commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs;    \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate remeasurement volatility   \n  \u2022    of foreign currency denominated        \n       balances; and                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate the volatility of the      \n  \u2022    Company\u2019s net investment in foreign    \n       operations driven by fluctuations in   \n       foreign currency exchange rates.       \n                                              \nIn addition, the Company enters into interest \nrate and foreign exchange derivative contracts\nto support the business requirements of its   \ncustomers (customer-related positions). The   \nCompany minimizes the market and liquidity    \nrisks of customer-related positions by either \nentering into similar offsetting positions    \nwith broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis  \nby entering into other derivative or non-     \nderivativefinancial instruments that partially\nor fully offset the exposure from these       \ncustomer-related positions. The Company may   \nenter into derivative contracts that are      \neither exchange-traded, centrally cleared     \nthrough clearinghouses or over-the-counter.The\nCompany does not utilize derivatives for      \nspeculative purposes. The Company does not    \ndesignate all of the derivatives that it      \nenters into for risk management purposes as   \naccounting hedges because of the inefficiency \nof applying the accounting requirements and   \nmay instead elect fair value accounting for   \nthe related hedged items. In particular, the  \nCompany enters into interest rate swaps,      \nswaptions, forward commitments to buy to-be-  \nannouncedsecurities (\u201cTBAs\u201d), U.S. Treasury   \nand Eurodollar futures and options on U.S.    \nTreasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in  \nthe value of its MSRs, but does not designate \nthose derivatives as accounting hedges.       \nAdditionally, the Company uses forward        \ncommitments to sell TBAs and other commitments\nto sell residential mortgage loans at         \nspecified prices to economically hedge the    \ninterest rate risk in its residential mortgage\nloan production activities. At June 30, 2022, \nthe Company had $5.1 billion of forward       \ncommitments to sell, hedging $2.1 billion of  \nMLHFS and $4.0 billion of unfunded mortgage   \nloan commitments. The forward commitments to  \nsell and the unfunded mortgage loan           \ncommitments on loans intended to be sold are  \nconsidered derivatives under the accounting   \nguidance related to accounting for derivative \ninstruments and hedging activities. The       \nCompany has elected the fair value option for \nthe MLHFS. Derivatives are subject to credit  \nrisk associated with counterparties to the    \ncontracts. Credit risk associated with        \nderivatives is measured by the Company based  \non the probability of counterparty default.   \nThe Company manages the credit risk of its    \nderivative positions by diversifying its      \npositions among various counterparties, by    \nentering into master netting arrangements,    \nand, where possible, by requiring collateral  \narrangements. The Company may also transfer   \ncounterparty credit risk related to interest  \nrate swaps to third parties through the use of\nrisk participation agreements. In addition,   \ncertain interest rate swaps, interest rate    \nforwards and credit contracts are required to \nbe centrally cleared through clearinghouses to\nfurther mitigate counterparty credit risk.

LIBOR Transition In July 2017, the\nUnited Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority  \n(the \u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it would no longer \nrequire banks to submit rates for the London  \nInterBank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) after 2021.  \nIn March 2021, the FCA and the administrator  \nof LIBOR announced that, with respect to the  \nmost commonly used tenors of United States    \nDollar LIBOR, LIBOR will no longer be         \npublished on a representative basis after June\n30, 2023. The publication of all other tenors \nof United States Dollar LIBOR ceased to be    \nprovided or ceased to be representative after \nDecember 31, 2021. The Company holds financial\ninstruments impacted by the discontinuance of \nLIBOR, including certain loans, investment    \nsecurities, derivatives,                      \n                      \n  22    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nborrowings and other financial instruments    \nthat use LIBOR as the benchmark rate. The     \nCompany also provides various services to     \ncustomers in its capacities as trustee and    \nservicer, which involve financial instruments \nthat will be similarly impacted by the        \ndiscontinuance of LIBOR. The Company has      \ntransitioned financial instruments associated \nto LIBOR currencies and tenors that ceased or \nbecame nonrepresentative on December 31, 2021 \nto alternative reference rates, with limited  \nexceptions. The Company also anticipates that \nadditional financial instruments associated to\nthe remaining United States Dollar LIBOR      \ntenors will require transition to a new       \nreference rate by June 30, 2023. The Company  \nis currently assessing the applicability and  \nscope of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) \nAct (the \u201cLIBOR Act\u201d), which was enacted on   \nMarch 15, 2022. The LIBOR Act establishes a   \nprocess for replacing LIBOR on existing LIBOR \ncontracts that do not provide for the use of a\nclearly defined or practicable replacement    \nbenchmark rate by providing that a benchmark  \nreplacement identified by the Federal Reserve \nBoard that is based on the Secured Overnight  \nFinancing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) will replace LIBOR as \nthe benchmark for such contracts. The final   \nimplementation of the LIBOR Act currently     \nremains uncertain, as the Federal Reserve has \n180 days after its enactment to issue any     \nregulations that are necessary for its        \nadministration. In order to facilitate the    \ntransition process, the Company has instituted\na LIBOR Transition Office and commenced an    \nenterprise-wide project to identify, assess,  \nmonitor and mitigate risks associated with the\nexpected discontinuance or unavailability of  \nLIBOR, actively engage with industry working  \ngroups and regulators, achieve operational    \nreadiness for the use of alternative reference\nrates and engage impacted customers to        \nremediate and transition impacted instruments.\nThe Company has also invested in updating its \nsystems, models, procedures and internal      \ninfrastructure as part of the transition      \nprogram. Additionally, in alignment with      \nguidance from United States banking agencies  \nand the FCA, the Company has ceased the use of\nLIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts,   \nwith limited exceptions, and continues to     \nincrease the usage of alternative reference   \nrates such as SOFR. The Company has also      \nadopted industry best practice guidelines for \nfallback language for new transactions,       \nconverted its cleared interest rate swaps     \ndiscounting to SOFR discounting, and          \ndistributed communications related to the     \ntransition to certain impacted parties, both  \ninside and outside the Company. Refer to \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on    \nForm 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2021,\nfor further discussion on potential risks that\ncould adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial\nresults as a result of the LIBOR transition.  \nMarket Risk Management In addition to interest\nrate risk, the Company is exposed to other    \nforms of market risk, principally related to  \ntrading activities which support customers\u2019   \nstrategies to manage their own foreign        \ncurrency, interest rate risk and funding      \nactivities. For purposes of its internal      \ncapital adequacy assessment process, the      \nCompany considers risk arising from its       \ntrading activities, as well as the            \nremeasurement volatility of foreign currency  \ndenominated balances included on its          \nConsolidated Balance Sheet (collectively,     \n\u201cCovered Positions\u201d), employing methodologies \nconsistent with the requirements of regulatory\nrules for market risk. The Company\u2019s Market   \nRisk Committee (\u201cMRC\u201d), within the framework  \nof the ALCO, oversees market risk management. \nThe MRC monitors and reviews the Company\u2019s    \nCovered Positions and establishes policies for\nmarket risk management, including exposure    \nlimits for each portfolio. The Company uses a \nVaR approach to measure general market risk.  \nTheoretically, VaR represents the statistical \nrisk of loss the Company has to adverse market\nmovements over a one-daytime horizon. The     \nCompany uses the Historical Simulation method \nto calculate VaR for its Covered Positions    \nmeasured at the ninety-ninth percentile using \na one-yearlook-back period for distributions  \nderived from past market data. The market     \nfactors used in the calculations include those\npertinent to market risks inherent in the     \nunderlying trading portfolios, principally    \nthose that affect the Company\u2019s corporate bond\ntrading business, foreign currency transaction\nbusiness, client derivatives business, loan   \ntrading business and municipal securities     \nbusiness, as well as those inherent in the    \nCompany\u2019s foreign denominated balances and the\nderivatives used to mitigate the related      \nmeasurement volatility. On average, the       \nCompany expects the one-dayVaR to be exceeded \nby actual losses two to three times per year  \nrelated to these positions. The Company       \nmonitors the accuracy of internal VaR models  \nand modeling processes by back-testing model  \nperformance, regularly updating the historical\ndata used by the VaR models and regular model \nvalidations to assess the accuracy of the     \nmodels\u2019 input, processing, and reporting      \ncomponents. All models are required to be     \nindependently reviewed and approved prior to  \nbeing placed in use. If the Company were to   \nexperience market losses in excess of the     \nestimated VaR more often than expected, the   \nVaR models and associated assumptions would be\nanalyzed and adjusted.                        \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    23  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe average, high, low and period-end one-    \ndayVaR amounts for the Company\u2019s Covered      \nPositions were as follows:                    \n                                              \n  Six Months Ended                            \n  June\u00a030                                     \n  (Dollars in                                 \n  Millions)                  2022       2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Average                 $     1    $     2  \n  High                          2          4  \n  Low                           1          1  \n  Period-end                    2          2  \n                                              \nThe Company did not experience any actual     \nlosses for its combined Covered Positions that\nexceeded VaR during the six months ended June \n30, 2022 and 2021.

The Company engages in various  \nactivities to manage its liquidity risk. These\nactivities include diversifying its funding   \nsources, stress testing, and holding readily- \nmarketable assets which can be used as a      \nsource of liquidity if needed. In addition,   \nthe Company\u2019s profitable operations, sound    \ncredit quality and strong capital position    \nhave enabled it to develop a large and        \nreliable base of core deposit funding within  \nits market areas and in domestic and global   \ncapital markets. The Company\u2019s Board of       \nDirectors approves the Company\u2019s liquidity    \npolicy. The Risk Management Committee of the  \nCompany\u2019s Board of Directors oversees the     \nCompany\u2019s liquidity risk management process   \nand approves a contingency funding plan. The  \nALCO reviews the Company\u2019s liquidity policy   \nand limits, and regularly assesses the        \nCompany\u2019s ability to meet funding requirements\narising from adverse company-specific or      \nmarket events. The Company regularly projects \nits funding needs under various stress        \nscenarios and maintains a contingency funding \nplan consistent with the Company\u2019s access to  \ndiversified sources of contingent funding. The\nCompany maintains a substantial level of total\navailable liquidity in the form of on-        \nbalancesheet and off-balancesheet funding     \nsources. These liquidity sources include cash \nat the Federal Reserve Bank and certain       \nEuropean central banks, unencumbered liquid   \nassets, and capacity to borrow from the FHLB  \nand at the Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s Discount    \nWindow. At June 30, 2022, the fair value of   \nunencumbered investment securities totaled    \n$137.5 billion, compared with $144.0 billion  \nat December 31, 2021.

Asset liquidity is     \nfurther enhanced by the Company\u2019s practice of \npledging loans to access secured borrowing    \nfacilities through the FHLB and               \n                      \n  24    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nFederal Reserve Bank. At June 30, 2022, the   \nCompany could have borrowed a total of an     \nadditional $95.5 billion from the FHLB and    \nFederal Reserve Bank based on collateral      \navailable for additional borrowings. The      \nCompany\u2019s diversified deposit base provides a \nsizeable source of relatively stable and low- \ncostfunding, while reducing the Company\u2019s     \nreliance on the wholesale markets. Total      \ndeposits were $467.1 billion at June 30, 2022,\ncompared with $456.1 billion at December 31,  \n2021. Refer to \u201cBalance Sheet Analysis\u201d for   \nfurther information on the Company\u2019s deposits.\nAdditional funding is provided by long-term   \ndebt and short-term borrowings. Long-term debt\nwas $29.4 billion at June 30, 2022, and is an \nimportant funding source because of its multi-\nyear borrowing structure. Short-term          \nborrowings were $25.0 billion at June 30,     \n2022, and supplement the Company\u2019s other      \nfunding sources. Refer to \u201cBalance Sheet      \nAnalysis\u201d for further information on the      \nCompany\u2019s long-term debt and short-term       \nborrowings. In addition to assessing liquidity\nrisk on a consolidated basis, the Company     \nmonitors the parent company\u2019s liquidity. The  \nCompany establishes limits for the minimal    \nnumber of months into the future where the    \nparent company can meet existing and          \nforecasted obligations with cash and          \nsecurities held that can be readily monetized.\nThe Company measures and manages this limit in\nboth normal and adverse conditions. The       \nCompany maintains sufficient funding to meet  \nexpected capital and debt service obligations \nfor 24 months without the support of dividends\nfrom subsidiaries and assuming access to the  \nwholesale markets is maintained. The Company  \nmaintains sufficient liquidity to meet its    \ncapital and debt service obligations for 12   \nmonths under adverse conditions without the   \nsupport of dividends from subsidiaries or     \naccess to the wholesale markets. The parent   \ncompany is currently well in excess of        \nrequired liquidity minimums. At June 30, 2022,\nparent company long-term debt outstanding was \n$18.4 billion, compared with $18.9 billion at \nDecember 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily \ndue to $1.3 billion of subordinated note and  \n$1.0 billion of medium-term note repayments,  \npartially offset by $2.1 billion of medium-   \nterm note issuances. As of June 30, 2022,     \nthere was no parent company debt scheduled to \nmature in the remainder of 2022. The Company  \nis subject to a regulatory Liquidity Coverage \nRatio (\u201cLCR\u201d) requirement which requires banks\nto maintain an adequate level of unencumbered \nhigh quality liquid assets to meet estimated  \nliquidity needs over a 30-daystressed period. \nAt June 30, 2022, the Company was compliant   \nwith this requirement. The Company is also    \nsubject to a regulatory Net Stable Funding    \nRatio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) requirement which requires     \nbanks to maintain a minimum level of stable   \nfunding based on the liquidity characteristics\nof their assets, commitments, and derivative  \nexposures over a one-yeartime horizon. At June\n30, 2022, the Company was compliant with this \nrequirement. Refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion\nand Analysis \u2014 Liquidity Risk Management\u201d in  \nthe Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor   \nthe year ended December 31, 2021, for further \ndiscussion on liquidity risk management.      \nEuropean Exposures The Company provides       \nmerchant processing and corporate trust       \nservices in Europe either directly or through \nbanking affiliations in Europe. Revenue       \ngenerated from sources in Europe represented  \napproximately 2 percent of the Company\u2019s total\nnet revenue for both the three and six months \nended June 30, 2022. Operating cash for these \nbusinesses is deposited on a short-term basis \ntypically with certain European central banks.\nFor deposits placed at other European banks,  \nexposure is mitigated by the Company placing  \ndeposits at multiple banks and managing the   \namounts on deposit at any bank based on       \ninstitution-specific deposit limits. At June  \n30, 2022, the Company had an aggregate amount \non deposit with European banks of             \napproximately $7.3 billion, predominately with\nthe Central Bank of Ireland and Bank of       \nEngland. In addition, the Company provides    \nfinancing to domestic multinational           \ncorporations that generate revenue from       \ncustomers in European countries, transacts    \nwith various European banks as counterparties \nto certain derivative-related activities, and \nthrough a subsidiary, manages money market    \nfunds that hold certain investments in        \nEuropean sovereign debt. Any deterioration in \neconomic conditions in Europe, including the  \nimpacts resulting from the Russia-Ukraine     \nconflict, is not expected to have a           \nsignificant effect on the Company related to  \nthese activities.

The Company also manages \nits capital to exceed regulatory capital      \nrequirements for banking organizations. The   \nregulatory capital requirements effective for \nthe Company follow Basel III, with the Company\nbeing subject to calculating its capital      \nadequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted     \nassets under the standardized approach.       \nBeginning in 2022, the Company began to phase \ninto its regulatory capital requirements the  \ncumulative deferred impact of its 2020        \nadoption of the accounting guidance related to\nthe impairment of financial instruments based \non the current expected credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d)\nmethodology plus 25 percent of its quarterly  \ncredit reserve increases over the past two    \nyears. This cumulative deferred impact will be\nphased into the Company\u2019s regulatory capital  \nover the next three years, culminating with a \nfully phased in regulatory capital calculation\nbeginning in 2025. Table 10 provides a summary\nof statutory regulatory capital ratios in     \neffect for the Company at June 30, 2022 and   \nDecember 31, 2021. All regulatory ratios      \nexceeded regulatory \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d        \nrequirements. The Company believes certain    \nother capital ratios are useful in evaluating \nits capital adequacy. The Company\u2019s tangible  \ncommon equity, as a percent of tangible assets\nand as a percent of risk-weighted assets      \ndetermined in accordance with transitional    \nregulatory capital requirements related to the\nCECL methodology under the standardized       \napproach, was 5.5 percent and 7.2 percent,    \nrespectively, at June 30, 2022, compared with \n6.8 percent and 9.2 percent, respectively, at \nDecember 31, 2021. In addition, the Company\u2019s \ncommon equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted \nassets ratio, reflecting the full             \nimplementation of the CECL methodology was 9.4\npercent at June 30, 2022, compared with 9.6   \npercent at December 31, 2021. Refer to \u201cNon-  \nGAAP Financial Measures\u201d beginning on page 31 \nfor further information on these other capital\nratios. Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders\u2019      \nequity was $48.6 billion at June 30, 2022,    \ncompared with $54.9 billion at December 31,   \n2021. The decrease was primarily the result of\nchanges in unrealized gains and losses on     \navailable-for-sale investment securities      \nincluded in other comprehensive income (loss) \nand dividends paid, partially offset by       \ncorporate earnings and the issuance of        \npreferred stock. The Company announced on     \nDecember 22, 2020 that its Board of Directors \nhad approved an authorization to repurchase   \n$3.0 billion of its common stock beginning    \nJanuary 1, 2021, and repurchased $1.5 billion \nof its common stock during the first six      \nmonths of 2021 under this program. The Company\nsuspended all common stock repurchases at the \nbeginning of the third quarter of 2021, except\nfor those done exclusively in connection with \nits stock-based compensation programs, due to \nits pending acquisition of MUFG Union Bank\u2019s  \ncore regional banking franchise. The Company  \nexpects to operate at a common equity tier 1  \ncapital ratio near its target ratio of 8.5    \npercent at the time of closing the acquisition\nand increasing toward 9.0 percent after       \nclosing of the acquisition. The Company does  \nnot expect to commence repurchasing its common\nstock until after the acquisition closes and  \nits common equity tier 1 capital ratio        \napproximates 9.0 percent.

LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL\nREVIEW The Company\u2019s major lines of business  \nare Corporate and Commercial Banking, Consumer\nand Business Banking, Wealth Management and   \nInvestment Services, Payment Services, and    \nTreasury and Corporate Support. These         \noperating segments are components of the      \nCompany about which financial information is  \nprepared and is evaluated regularly by        \nmanagement in deciding how to allocate        \nresources and assess performance. Basis for   \nFinancial Presentation Business line results  \nare derived from the Company\u2019s business unit  \nprofitability reporting systems by            \nspecifically attributing managed balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and    \ntheir related income or expense. Refer to Note\n17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial     \nStatements for further information on the     \nbusiness lines\u2019 basis for financial           \npresentation. Designations, assignments and   \nallocations change from time to time as       \nmanagement systems are enhanced, methods of   \nevaluating performance or product lines change\nor business segments are realigned to better  \nrespond to the Company\u2019s diverse customer     \nbase. During 2022, certain organization and   \nmethodology changes were made and,            \naccordingly, 2021 results were restated and   \npresented on a comparable basis. Corporate and\nCommercial Banking Corporate and Commercial   \nBanking offers lending, equipment finance and \nsmall-ticket leasing, depository services,    \ntreasury management, capital markets services,\ninternational trade services and other        \nfinancial services to middle market, large    \ncorporate, commercial real estate, financial  \ninstitution, non-profit and public sector     \nclients. Corporate and Commercial Banking     \ncontributed $377 million of the Company\u2019s net \nincome in the second quarter and $793 million \nin the first six months of 2022, or decreases \nof $41 million (9.8 percent) and $87 million  \n(9.9 percent), respectively, compared with the\nsame periods of 2021. Net revenue increased   \n$65 million (6.6 percent) in the second       \nquarter and $59 million (3.0 percent) in the  \nfirst six months of 2022, compared with the   \nsame periods of 2021. Net interest income, on \na taxable-equivalent basis, increased $58     \nmillion (8.0 percent) in the second quarter   \nand $75 million (5.2 percent) in the first six\nmonths of 2022, compared with the same periods\nof 2021. The increases were primarily due to  \nhigher loan and interest-bearing deposit      \nbalances, partially offset by lower spreads on\nloans and unfavorable changes in deposit      \nrates. Noninterest income increased $7 million\n(2.6 percent) in the second quarter of 2022,  \ncompared with the second quarter of 2021,     \nprimarily due to stronger treasury management \nfees driven by core growth and increased      \nfederal government volume. Noninterest income \ndecreased $16 million (3.0 percent) in the    \nfirst six months of 2022, compared with the   \nfirst six months of 2021, primarily due to    \nlower corporate bond fees and trading revenue \nwithin the capital markets business, partially\noffset by higher treasury management fees.    \nNoninterest expense increased $20 million (4.6\npercent) in the second quarter and $25 million\n(2.9 percent) in the first six months of 2022,\ncompared with the same periods of 2021,       \nprimarily due to higher Federal Deposit       \nInsurance Corporation insurance expense and   \nhigher compensation expense primarily due to  \nmerit increases, variable compensation and    \nhiring to support business growth, partially  \noffset by lower performance-based incentives  \nrelated to capital markets activity. The      \nprovision for credit losses increased $100    \nmillion in the second quarter and $150 million\nin the first six months of 2022, compared with\nthe same periods of 2021, primarily due to    \nloan loss provisions supporting stronger      \ngrowth in loan balances, partially offset by  \nimproving portfolio credit quality.

Noninterest expense increased $60      \nmillion (11.5 percent) in the second quarter  \nand $154 million (15.1 percent) in the first  \nsix months of 2022, compared with the same    \nperiods of 2021, reflecting higher            \ncompensation as a result of merit increases,  \nthe PFM acquisition, core business growth and \nperformance-based incentives, as well as      \nhigher net shared services expense driven by  \ninvestment in support of business growth.     \nNoninterest expense further increased in the  \nfirst six months of 2022, compared with the   \nfirst six months of 2021, due to litigation   \nsettlements and fraud-related losses. The     \nprovision for credit losses was flat in the   \nsecond quarter and increased $3 million in the\nfirst six months of 2022, compared with the   \nsame periods of 2021. Payment Services Payment\nServices includes consumer and business credit\ncards, stored-value cards, debit cards,       \ncorporate, government and purchasing card     \nservices, consumer lines of credit and        \nmerchant processing. Payment Services         \ncontributed $391 million of the Company\u2019s net \nincome in the second quarter and $762 million \nin the first six months of 2022, or decreases \nof $50 million (11.3 percent) and $172 million\n(18.4 percent), respectively, compared with   \nthe same periods of 2021. Net revenue         \nincreased $105 million (7.0 percent) in the   \nsecond quarter and $171 million (5.9 percent) \nin the first six months of 2022, compared with\nthe same periods of 2021. Noninterest income  \nincreased $81 million (8.9 percent) in the    \nsecond quarter and $154 million (9.1 percent) \nin the first six months of 2022, compared with\nthe same periods of 2021, mainly due to       \ncontinued strengthening of consumer and       \nbusiness spending across most sectors. As a   \nresult, there was strong growth in merchant   \nprocessing services revenue driven by higher  \nsales volume and higher merchant fees,        \npartially offset by higher rebates. There was \nalso growth in corporate payment products     \nrevenue driven by improving business spending \nacross all product groups. Strong consumer    \nspending also drove an increase in credit and \ndebit card revenue, mostly offset by declining\nprepaid processing fees as the beneficial     \nimpact of                                     \n                      \n  30    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \ngovernment stimulus programs dissipated year- \nover-year. Net interest income, on a taxable- \nequivalent basis, increased $24 million (4.0  \npercent) in the second quarter and $17 million\n(1.4 percent) in the first six months of 2022,\ncompared with the same periods of 2021,       \nprimarily due to higher loan balances and loan\nfees, partially offset by lower loan yields   \ndriven by declining customer revolve rates.   \nNoninterest expense increased $42 million (5.1\npercent) in the second quarter and $99 million\n(6.1 percent) in the first six months of 2022,\ncompared with the same periods of 2021,       \nreflecting higher net shared services expense \ndriven by investment in infrastructure and    \ntechnology development, in addition to higher \ncompensation expense as a result of merit     \nincreases, core business growth and variable  \ncompensation. The provision for credit losses \nincreased $130 million in the second quarter  \nand $301 million in the first six months of   \n2022, compared with the same periods of 2021, \nprimarily due to stronger growth in loan      \nbalances and relatively stable credit quality \nin the current year, compared with a stronger \ndecline in delinquencies in the prior year.   \nTreasury and Corporate Support Treasury and   \nCorporate Support includes the Company\u2019s      \ninvestment portfolios, funding, capital       \nmanagement, interest rate risk management,    \nincome taxes not allocated to the business    \nlines, including most investments in tax-     \nadvantaged projects, and the residual         \naggregate of those expenses associated with   \ncorporate activities that are managed on a    \nconsolidated basis. Treasury and Corporate    \nSupport recorded a net loss of $58 million in \nthe second quarter and net income of $131     \nmillion in the first six months of 2022,      \ncompared with net income of $269 million and  \n$808 million in the same periods of 2021,     \nrespectively. Net revenue increased $6 million\n(1.9 percent) in the second quarter and $97   \nmillion (18.7 percent) in the first six months\nof 2022, compared with the same periods of    \n2021. Net interest income, on a taxable-      \nequivalent basis, increased $29 million (46.0 \npercent) in the second quarter and $112       \nmillion in the first six months of 2022,      \ncompared with the same periods of 2021,       \nprimarily due to higher investment securities \nportfolio and cash balances. Noninterest      \nincome decreased $23 million (8.9 percent) in \nthe second quarter and $15 million (3.1       \npercent) in the first six months of 2022,     \ncompared with the same periods of 2021,       \nprimarily due to lower securities gains and   \nlower gains on the disposition of assets,     \npartially offset by higher commercial products\nrevenue. Noninterest expense increased $171   \nmillion (74.7 percent) in the second quarter  \nand $74 million (13.8 percent) in the first   \nsix months of 2022, compared with the same    \nperiods of 2021, primarily due to merger and  \nintegration-related charges associated with   \nthe planned acquisition of MUFG Union Bank and\nhigher compensation expense reflecting merit  \nincreases, hiring to support business growth  \nand core business growth net of lower variable\ncompensation, partially offset by lower net   \nshared services expense. The provision for    \ncredit losses increased $258 million in the   \nsecond quarter and $886 million (99.1 percent)\nin the first six months of 2022, compared with\nthe same periods of 2021, reflecting the      \nresidual impact of changes in the allowance   \nfor credit losses being impacted by increasing\neconomic uncertainty in the current year,     \ncompared to improving economic conditions in  \nthe prior year. Income taxes are assessed to  \neach line of business at a managerial tax rate\nof 25.0 percent with the residual tax expense \nor benefit to arrive at the consolidated      \neffective tax rate included in Treasury and   \nCorporate Support. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn addition to capital ratios defined by      \nbanking regulators, the Company considers     \nvarious other measures when evaluating capital\nutilization and adequacy, including:          \n                                              \n  \u2022    Tangible common equity to tangible     \n       assets,                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Tangible common equity to              \n       risk-weighted assets, and              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Common equity tier\u00a01 capital to        \n  \u2022    risk-weighted assets, reflecting the   \n       full implementation of the CECL        \n       methodology.                           \n                                              \nThese capital measures are viewed by          \nmanagement as useful additional methods of    \nevaluating the Company\u2019s utilization of its   \ncapital held and the level of capital         \navailable to withstand unexpected negative    \nmarket or economic conditions. Additionally,  \npresentation of these measures allows         \ninvestors, analysts and banking regulators to \nassess the Company\u2019s capital position relative\nto other financial services companies. These  \ncapital measures are not defined in generally \naccepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), or   \nare not currently effective or defined in     \nbanking regulations. In addition, certain of  \nthese measures differ from currently effective\ncapital ratios defined by banking regulations \nprincipally in that the currently effective   \nratios, which are subject to certain          \ntransitional provisions, temporarily exclude  \nthe impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting \nguidance related to impairment of financial   \ninstruments based on the CECL methodology. As \na result, these capital measures disclosed by \nthe Company may be considered non-GAAP        \nfinancial measures. Management believes this  \ninformation helps investors assess trends in  \nthe Company\u2019s capital adequacy.               \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    31  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe Company also discloses net interest income\nand related ratios and analysis on a taxable- \nequivalent basis, which may also be considered\nnon-GAAP financial measures. The Company      \nbelieves this presentation to be the preferred\nindustry measurement of net interest income as\nit provides a relevant comparison of net      \ninterest income arising from taxable and tax- \nexempt sources. In addition, certain          \nperformance measures, including the efficiency\nratio and net interest margin utilize net     \ninterest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.\nThere may be limits in the usefulness of these\nmeasures to investors. As a result, the       \nCompany encourages readers to consider the    \nconsolidated financial statements and other   \nfinancial information contained in this report\nin their entirety, and not to rely on any     \nsingle financial measure.

accounting principles generally accepted \nin the United States and conform to general   \npractices within the banking industry. The    \npreparation of financial statements in        \nconformity with GAAP requires management to   \nmake estimates and assumptions. The Company\u2019s \nfinancial position and results of operations  \ncan be affected by these estimates and        \nassumptions, which are integral to            \nunderstanding the Company\u2019s financial         \nstatements. Critical accounting policies are  \nthose policies management believes are the    \nmost important to the portrayal of the        \nCompany\u2019s financial condition and results, and\nrequire management to make estimates that are \ndifficult, subjective or complex. Most        \naccounting policies are not considered by     \nmanagement to be critical accounting policies.\nManagement has discussed the development and  \nthe selection of critical accounting policies \nwith the Company\u2019s Audit Committee. Those     \npolicies considered to be critical accounting \npolicies relate to the allowance for credit   \nlosses, fair value estimates, MSRs, and income\ntaxes. These accounting policies are discussed\nin detail in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and     \nAnalysis \u2014 Critical Accounting Policies\u201d and  \nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K   \nfor the year ended December 31, 2021. CONTROLS\nAND PROCEDURES Under the supervision and with \nthe participation of the Company\u2019s management,\nincluding its principal executive officer and \nprincipal financial officer, the Company has  \nevaluated the effectiveness of the design and \noperation of its disclosure controls and      \nprocedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and \n15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)). Based upon this   \nevaluation, the principal executive officer   \nand principal financial officer have concluded\nthat, as of the end of the period covered by  \nthis report, the Company\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures were effective. During the most\nrecently completed fiscal quarter, there was  \nno change made in the Company\u2019s internal      \ncontrol over financial reporting (as defined  \nin Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the    \nExchange Act) that has materially affected, or\nis reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial     \nreporting.

in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in   \nthe United States. In the opinion of          \nmanagement of U.S.\u00a0Bancorp (the \u201cCompany\u201d),   \nall adjustments (consisting only of normal    \nrecurring adjustments) necessary for a fair   \nstatement of results for the interim periods  \nhave been made. These financial statements and\nnotes should be read in conjunction with the  \nconsolidated financial statements and notes   \nincluded in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on    \nForm\u00a010-K for the year ended December\u00a031,     \n2021. Certain amounts in prior periods have   \nbeen reclassified to conform to the current   \nperiod presentation.                          \n                                \n  Note\u00a02    Accounting Changes  \n                                \nReference Interest Rate Transition In March   \n2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(\u201cFASB\u201d) issued accounting guidance, providing\ntemporary optional expedients and exceptions  \nto the guidance in United States generally    \naccepted accounting principles on contract    \nmodifications and hedge accounting, to ease   \nthe financial reporting burdens related to the\nexpected market transition from the London    \nInterbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and other    \ninterbank offered rates to alternative        \nreference rates. Under the guidance, a company\ncan elect not to apply certain modification   \naccounting requirements to contracts affected \nby reference rate transition, if certain      \ncriteria are met. A company that makes this   \nelection would not be required to remeasure   \nthe contracts at the modification date or     \nreassess a previous accounting determination. \nThis guidance also permits a company to elect \nvarious optional expedients that would allow  \nit to continue applying hedge accounting for  \nhedging relationships affected by reference   \nrate transition, if certain criteria are met. \nThe guidance is effective upon issuance and   \ngenerally can be applied through December 31, \n2022. The Company is in the process of        \nevaluating and applying, as applicable, the   \noptional expedients and exceptions in         \naccounting for eligible contract              \nmodifications, eligible existing hedging      \nrelationships and new hedging relationships   \navailable through December 31, 2022. The      \nadoption of this guidance has not had, and is \nexpected to continue to not have, a material  \nimpact on the Company\u2019s financial statements. \nFair Value Hedging \u2013 Portfolio Layer Method In\nMarch 2022, the FASB issued accounting        \nguidance, effective for the Company no later  \nthan January 1, 2023, related to fair value   \nhedge accounting of portfolios of financial   \nassets. This guidance expands the current     \nlast-of-layer hedging method that permits a   \ncompany to apply fair value hedging to a      \nstated amount of a closed portfolio of        \nprepayable financial assets, by allowing it to\ndesignate multiple hedging relationships on a \nsingle closed portfolio, resulting in a larger\nportion of the interest rate risk associated  \nwith such a portfolio being eligible to be    \nhedged. The guidance also expands the scope of\nthe method to include non-prepayable financial\nassets and clarifies other technical questions\nfrom the original accounting guidance. The    \nCompany expects the adoption of this guidance \nwill not be material to its financial         \nstatements.                                   \nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Troubled Debt         \nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures In     \nMarch 2022, the FASB issued accounting        \nguidance, effective for the Company no later  \nthan January 1, 2023, related to the          \nrecognition and measurement of troubled debt  \nrestructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d) by creditors. This    \nguidance removes the separate recognition and \nmeasurement requirements for TDRs by replacing\nthem with a requirement for a company to apply\nexisting accounting guidance to determine     \nwhether a modification results in a new loan  \nor a continuation of an existing loan. This   \nguidance also replaces existing TDR           \ndisclosures with similar but more expansive   \ndisclosures for certain modifications of      \nreceivables made to borrowers experiencing    \nfinancial difficulty. Further, this guidance  \nalso requires companies to disclose current-  \nperiod gross write-offs by year of origination\nfor financing receivables. The guidance can be\nadopted on a prospective or modified          \nretrospective basis. The Company expects the  \nadoption of this guidance will not be material\nto its financial statements.                  \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    39  \n                      \nTable of Contents\n                                    \n  Note\u00a0\u00a03    Business Combinations  \n                                    \nIn September 2021, the Company announced that \nit entered into a definitive agreement to     \nacquire MUFG Union Bank\u2019s core regional       \nbanking franchise from Mitsubishi UFJ         \nFinancial Group, Inc.

The transaction       \nexcludes the purchase of substantially all of \nMUFG Union Bank\u2019s Global Corporate\u00a0&          \nInvestment Bank (other than certain deposits),\ncertain middle and back office functions, and \nother assets. MUFG Union Bank has             \napproximately 300 branches in California,     \nWashington and Oregon and is expected to add  \napproximately $ 105 billion in total assets, $\n58 billion of loans and $ 90 billion of       \ndeposits to the Company\u2019s consolidated balance\nsheet. Closing of the transaction is subject  \nto customary closing conditions, including    \nregulatory approvals which are not within the \nCompany\u2019s control. The parties continue to    \nmake significant progress in planning for     \nclosing and integration while awaiting        \nregulatory approvals. At this time, the       \nCompany expects to receive U.S. regulatory    \napprovals in time for closing to occur in the \nsecond half of 2022.                          \n                                    \n  Note\u00a0\u00a04    Investment Securities  \n                                    \nThe Company\u2019s held-to-maturity investment     \nsecurities are carried at historical cost,    \nadjusted for amortization of premiums and     \naccretion of discounts.

conducts a regular assessment of  \nits available-for-sale investment securities  \nwith unrealized losses to determine whether   \nall or some portion of a security\u2019s unrealized\nloss is related to credit and an allowance for\ncredit losses is necessary. If the Company    \nintends to sell or it is more likely than not \nthe Company will be required to sell an       \ninvestment security, the amortized cost of the\nsecurity is written down to fair value. When  \nevaluating credit losses, the Company         \nconsiders various factors such as the nature  \nof the investment security, the credit ratings\nor financial condition of the issuer, the     \nextent of the unrealized loss, expected cash  \nflows of underlying collateral, the existence \nof any government or agency guarantees, and   \nmarket conditions. The Company measures the   \nallowance for credit losses using market      \ninformation where available and discounting   \nthe cash flows at the original effective rate \nof the investment security. The allowance for \ncredit losses is adjusted each period through \nearnings and can be subsequently recovered.   \nThe allowance for credit losses on the        \nCompany\u2019s available-for-sale investment       \nsecurities was immaterial at June\u00a030, 2022 and\nDecember\u00a031, 2021.                            \n                                              \nAt June\u00a030, 2022, certain investment          \nsecurities had a fair value below amortized   \ncost. The following table shows the gross     \nunrealized losses and fair value of the       \nCompany\u2019s available-for-sale investment       \nsecurities with unrealized losses, aggregated \nby investment category and length of time the \nindividual investment securities have been in \ncontinuous unrealized loss positions, at June \n30, 2022:                                     \n                                              \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2013    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \nThese unrealized losses primarily relate to   \nchanges in interest rates and market spreads  \nsubsequent to purchase of these available-for-\nsale investment securities. U.S. Treasury and \nagencies securities and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities are issued, guaranteed or otherwise\nsupported by the United States government. The\nCompany\u2019s obligations of state and political  \nsubdivisions are generally high grade.        \nAccordingly, the Company does not consider    \nthese unrealized losses to be credit-related  \nand an allowance for credit losses is not     \nnecessary. In general, the issuers of the     \ninvestment securities are contractually       \nprohibited from prepayment at less than par,  \nand the Company did not pay significant       \npurchase premiums for these investment        \nsecurities. At June\u00a030, 2022, the Company had \nno plans to sell investment securities with   \nunrealized losses, and believes it is more    \nlikely than not it would not be required to   \nsell such investment securities before        \nrecovery o f their amortized cost.            \n                                              \nDuring the six months ended June\u00a030, 2022 and \n2021, the Company did not purchase any        \ninvestment securities that had more-than-     \ninsignificant credit deterioration.           \n                                              \nAll of the Company\u2019s held-to-maturity         \ninvestment securities are highly rated agency \nmortgage-backed securities that are guaranteed\nor otherwise supported by the United States   \ngovernment and have no history of credit      \nlosses. Accordingly the Company does not      \nexpect to incur any credit losses on held-to- \nmaturity investment securities and has no     \nallowance for credit losses recorded for these\nsecurities.

Company had loans of $ 92.4 billion at    \nJune\u00a030, 2022, and $ 92.1 billion at          \nDecember\u00a031, 2021, pledged at the Federal Home\nLoan Bank, and loans of $ 83.7 billion at     \nJune\u00a030, 2022, and $ 76.9 billion at          \nDecember\u00a031, 2021, pledged at the Federal     \nReserve Bank.                                 \nOriginated loans are reported at the principal\namount outstanding, net of unearned interest  \nand deferred fees and costs, and any partial  \ncharge-offs recorded. Net unearned interest   \nand deferred fees and costs amounted to $ 364 \nmillion at June\u00a030, 2022 and $ 475 million at \nDecember\u00a031, 2021. All purchased loans are    \nrecorded at fair value at the date of         \npurchase. The Company evaluates purchased     \nloans for more-than-insignificant             \ndeterioration at the date of purchase in      \naccordance with applicable authoritative      \naccounting guidance. Purchased loans that have\nexperienced more-than-insignificant           \ndeterioration from origination are considered \npurchased credit deteriorated loans. All other\npurchased loans are considered non-purchased  \ncredit deteriorated loans.                    \nAllowance for Credit Losses The allowance for \ncredit losses is established for current      \nexpected credit losses on the Company\u2019s loan  \nand lease portfolio, including unfunded credit\ncommitments. The allowance considers expected \nlosses for the remaining lives of the         \napplicable assets, inclusive of expected      \nrecoveries. The allowance for credit losses is\nincreased through provisions charged to       \nearnings and reduced by net charge-offs.      \nManagement evaluates the appropriateness of   \nthe allowance for credit losses on a quarterly\nbasis.                                        \nMultiple economic scenarios are considered    \nover a three-year reasonable and supportable  \nforecast period, which includes increasing    \nconsideration of historical loss experience   \nover years two and three. These economic      \nscenarios are constructed with interrelated   \nprojections of multiple economic variables,   \nand loss estimates are produced that consider \nthe historical correlation of those economic  \nvariables with credit losses. After the       \nforecast period, the Company fully reverts to \nlong-term historical loss experience, adjusted\nfor prepayments and characteristics of the    \ncurrent loan and lease portfolio, to estimate \nlosses over the remaining life of the         \nportfolio. The economic scenarios are updated \nat least quarterly and are designed to provide\na range of reasonable estimates, from better  \nto worse than current expectations. Scenarios \nare weighted based on the Company\u2019s           \nexpectation of economic conditions for the    \nforeseeable future and reflect significant    \njudgment and consideration of economic        \nforecast uncertainty. Final loss estimates    \nalso consider factors affecting credit losses \nnot reflected in the scenarios, due to the    \nunique aspects of current conditions and      \nexpectations. These factors may include, but  \nare not limited to, loan servicing practices, \nregulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and        \nmonetary policy actions.                      \nThe allowance recorded for credit losses      \nutilizes forward-looking expected loss models \nto consider a variety of factors affecting    \nlifetime credit losses. These factors include,\nbut are not limited to, macroeconomic         \nvariables such as unemployment rates, real    \nestate prices, gross domestic product levels  \nand corporate bonds spreads, as well as loan  \nand                                           \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    43  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nborrower characteristics, such as internal    \nrisk ratings on commercial loans and consumer \ncredit scores, delinquency status, collateral \ntype and available valuation information,     \nconsideration of end-of-term losses on lease  \nresiduals, and the remaining term of the loan,\nadjusted for expected prepayments. For each   \nloan portfolio, model estimates are adjusted  \nas necessary to consider any relevant changes \nin portfolio composition, lending policies,   \nunderwriting standards, risk management       \npractices, economic conditions or other       \nfactors that would affect the accuracy of the \nmodel. Expected credit loss estimates also    \ninclude consideration of expected cash        \nrecoveries on loans previously charged-off or \nexpected recoveries on collateral dependent   \nloans where recovery is expected through sale \nof the collateral. Where loans do not exhibit \nsimilar risk characteristics, an individual   \nanalysis is performed to consider expected    \ncredit losses. The allowance recorded for     \nindividually evaluated loans greater than $   \n5million in the commercial lending segment is \nbased on an analysis utilizing expected cash  \nflows discounted using the original effective \ninterest rate, the observable market price of \nthe loan, or the fair value of the collateral,\nless selling costs, for collateral-dependent  \nloans as appropriate. The allowance recorded  \nfor Troubled Debt Restructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d) loans \nin the consumer lending segment is determined \non a homogenous pool basis utilizing expected \ncash flows discounted using the original      \neffective interest rate of the pool. The      \nexpected cash flows on TDR loans consider     \nsubsequent payment defaults since             \nmodification, the borrower\u2019s ability to pay   \nunder the restructured terms, and the timing  \nand amount of payments. The allowance for     \ncollateral-dependent loans in the consumer    \nlending segment is determined based on the    \nfair value of the collateral less costs to    \nsell. For commercial TDRs individually        \nevaluated for impairment, attributes of the   \nborrower are the primary factors in           \ndetermining the allowance for credit losses.  \nFor smaller commercial loans collectively     \nevaluated for impairment, historical loss     \nexperience is also incorporated into the      \nallowance methodology applied to this category\nof loans. The Company\u2019s methodology for       \ndetermining the appropriate allowance for     \ncredit losses also considers the imprecision  \ninherent in the methodologies used and        \nallocated to the various loan portfolios. As a\nresult, amounts determined under the          \nmethodologies described above, are adjusted by\nmanagement to consider the potential impact of\nother qualitative factors not captured in the \nquantitative model adjustments which include, \nbut are not limited to the following: model   \nimprecision, imprecision in economic scenario \nassumptions, and emerging risks related to    \neither changes in the environment that are    \naffecting specific portfolios, or changes in  \nportfolio concentrations over time that may   \naffect model performance. The consideration of\nthese items results in adjustments to         \nallowance amounts included in the Company\u2019s   \nallowance for credit losses for each loan     \nportfolio. The Company also assesses the      \ncredit risk associated with off-balance sheet \nloan commitments, letters of credit,          \ninvestment securities and derivatives. Credit \nrisk associated with derivatives is reflected \nin the fair values recorded for those         \npositions. The liability for off-balance sheet\ncredit exposure related to loan commitments   \nand other credit guarantees is included in    \nother liabilities. Because business processes \nand credit risks associated with unfunded     \ncredit commitments are essentially the same as\nfor loans, the Company utilizes similar       \nprocesses to estimate its liability for       \nunfunded credit commitments. The results of   \nthe analysis are evaluated quarterly to       \nconfirm the estimates are appropriate for each\nspecific loan portfolio, as well as the entire\nloan portfolio, as the entire allowance for   \ncredit losses is available for the entire loan\nportfolio.                                    \n                      \n  44    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n

number of    \ndays delinquent except for monthly amortizing \nloans which are classified delinquent based   \nupon the number of contractually required     \npayments not made (for example, two missed    \npayments is considered 30 days delinquent).   \nWhen a loan is placed on nonaccrual status,   \nunpaid accrued interest is reversed, reducing \ninterest income in the current period.        \n                                              \nCommercial lending segment loans are generally\nplaced on nonaccrual status when the          \ncollection of principal and interest has      \nbecome 90 days past due or is otherwise       \nconsidered doubtful. Commercial lending       \nsegment loans are generally fully charged down\nif unsecured by collateral or partially       \ncharged down to the fair value of the         \ncollateral securing the loan, less costs to   \nsell, when the loan is placed on nonaccrual.  \n                                              \nConsumer lending segment loans are generally  \ncharged-off at a specific number of days or   \npayments past due. Residential mortgages and  \nother retail loans secured by 1-4 family      \nproperties are generally charged down to the  \nfair value of the collateral securing the     \nloan, less costs to sell, at 180 days past    \ndue. Residential mortgage loans and lines in a\nfirst lien position are placed on nonaccrual  \nstatus in instances where a partial charge-off\noccurs unless the loan is well secured and in \nthe process of collection. Residential        \nmortgage loans and lines in a junior lien     \nposition secured by 1-4 family properties are \nplaced on nonaccrual status at 120 days past  \ndue or when they are behind a first lien that \nhas                                           \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    45  \n                      \nTable of Contents become 180 days or greater\npast due or placed on nonaccrual status. Any\nsecured consumer lending segment loan whose\nborrower has had debt discharged through\nbankruptcy, for which the loan amount exceeds\nthe fair value of the collateral, is charged\ndown to the fair value of the related\ncollateral and the remaining balance is placed\non nonaccrual status. Credit card loans\ncontinue to accrue interest until the account\nis charged-off. Credit cards are charged-off\nat 180 days past due. Other retail loans not\nsecured by 1-4 family properties are charged-\noff at 120 days past due; and revolving\nconsumer lines are charged-off at 180 days\npast due. Similar to credit cards, other\nretail loans are generally not placed on\nnonaccrual status because of the relative\nshort period of time to charge-off. Certain\nretail customers having financial difficulties\nmay have the terms of their credit card and\nother loan agreements modified to require only\nprincipal payments and, as such, are reported\nas nonaccrual.\nFor all loan classes, interest payments       \nreceived on nonaccrual loans are generally    \nrecorded as a reduction to a loan\u2019s carrying  \namount while a loan is on nonaccrual and are  \nrecognized as interest income upon payoff of  \nthe loan. However, interest income may be     \nrecognized for interest payments if the       \nremaining carrying amount of the loan is      \nbelieved to be collectible. In certain        \ncircumstances, loans in any class may be      \nrestored to accrual status, such as when a    \nloan has demonstrated sustained repayment     \nperformance or no amounts are past due and    \nprospects for future payment are no longer in \ndoubt; or when the loan becomes well secured  \nand is in the process of collection. Loans    \nwhere there has been a partial charge-off may \nbe returned to accrual status if all principal\nand interest (including amounts previously    \ncharged-off) is expected to be collected and  \nthe loan is current.                          \nThe following table provides a summary of     \nloans by portfolio class, including the       \ndelinquency status of those that continue to  \naccrue interest, and those that are           \nnonperforming:                                \n                                              \n  (\u2026                                          \n  in                       90                 \n  M\u2026                      Da\u2026                 \n  J\u2026              30-\u2026    or\u2026                 \n  3\u2026       Ac\u2026    Day\u2026    Pa\u2026    Non\u2026         \n  2\u2026       Cu\u2026     Due    Due     (b)    To\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  C\u2026    $  12\u2026       $      $    $148    $1\u2026  \n                   254     91                 \n  C\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026       39\u2026      24      4     206    39\u2026  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026       81\u2026     100    102     223    82\u2026  \n  (\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026       23\u2026     200    164       \u2013    23\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       60\u2026     236     62     148    60\u2026  \n  r\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026    $  33\u2026            $4\u2026    $725    $3\u2026  \n  l\u2026                                          \n  D\u2026                                          \n  3\u2026                                          \n  2\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026    $  11\u2026       $    $49    $174    $1\u2026  \n                   530                        \n  C\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026       38\u2026      80     11     284    39\u2026  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026       75\u2026     124    181     226    76\u2026  \n  (\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026       22\u2026     193    165       \u2013    22\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       61\u2026     275     66     150    61\u2026  \n  r\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026    $  30\u2026    $1,\u2026    $4\u2026    $834    $3\u2026  \n  l\u2026                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       At June\u00a030, 2022, $642million of       \n       loans 30\u201389 days past due and          \n       $1.7billion of loans 90 days or more   \n       past due purchasedand loans that       \n       could be purchasedfrom Government      \n       National Mortgage Association          \n       (\u201cGNMA\u201d) mortgage poolsunder           \n  (a)  delinquent loan repurchase             \n       optionswhose repayments are insured    \n       by the Federal Housing Administration  \n       or guaranteed by the United States     \n       Department of Veterans Affairs, were   \n       classified as current, compared with   \n       $791million and $1.5billion at         \n       December\u00a031, 2021, respectively.       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Substantially all nonperforming loans  \n       at June\u00a030, 2022 and December\u00a031,      \n       2021, had an associated allowance for  \n       credit losses.

Restructurings In certain       \ncircumstances, the Company may modify the     \nterms of a loan to maximize the collection of \namounts due when a borrower is experiencing   \nfinancial difficulties

payments to be      \nreceived. The Company recognizes interest on  \nTDRs if the borrower complies with the revised\nterms and conditions as agreed upon with the  \nCompany and has demonstrated repayment        \nperformance at a level commensurate with the  \nmodified terms over several payment cycles,   \nwhich is generally six months or greater. To  \nthe extent a previous restructuring was       \ninsignificant, the Company considers the      \ncumulative effect of past restructurings      \nrelated to the receivable when determining    \nwhether a current restructuring is a TDR.     \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    47  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a summary of     \nloans modified as TDRs for the periods        \npresented by portfolio class:                 \n                                              \n        20\u2026                 20\u2026               \n  (\u2026    Nu\u2026    Pr\u2026          Nu\u2026    P\u2026         \n  in     of    Ou\u2026    P\u2026     of    O\u2026    Po\u2026  \n  M\u2026    Lo\u2026    Lo\u2026          Lo\u2026    L\u2026         \n               Ba\u2026                 B\u2026         \n  T\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  J\u2026                                          \n  30                                          \n  C\u2026    506      $     $    526     $      $  \n                50    41           12     13  \n  C\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026     28     11     9     30    38     41  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026    366    106    1\u2026    360    1\u2026    140  \n  m\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026    8,\u2026     48    49    5,\u2026    31     31  \n  c\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026    756     24    20    468    18     17  \n  r\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n  e\u2026                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n  p\u2026    10\u2026    239    2\u2026    6,\u2026    2\u2026    242  \n  f\u2026                                          \n  G\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026                                          \n  p\u2026                                          \n  L\u2026                                          \n  p\u2026                                          \n  f\u2026    353     47    50    478    67     69  \n  G\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026                                          \n  p\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026    10\u2026      $    $\u2026    6,\u2026     $      $  \n  l\u2026           286                 3\u2026    311  \n  S\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  J\u2026                                          \n  30                                          \n  C\u2026    1,\u2026      $     $    1,\u2026     $      $  \n                88    73           87     73  \n  C\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026     37     22    19     86    1\u2026    112  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026    1,\u2026    334    3\u2026    696    2\u2026    244  \n  m\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026    18\u2026     98    99    10\u2026    64     65  \n  c\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026    1,\u2026     61    57    1,\u2026    55     49  \n  r\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n  e\u2026                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n  p\u2026    21\u2026    603    5\u2026    14\u2026    5\u2026    543  \n  f\u2026                                          \n  G\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026                                          \n  p\u2026                                          \n  L\u2026                                          \n  p\u2026                                          \n  f\u2026    743    102    1\u2026    1,\u2026    1\u2026    158  \n  G\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026                                          \n  p\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026    22\u2026      $    $\u2026    15\u2026     $      $  \n  l\u2026           705                 7\u2026    701  \n                                              \nResidential mortgages, home equity and second \nmortgages, and loans purchased from GNMA      \nmortgage pools in the table above include     \ntrial period arrangements offered to customers\nduring the periods presented.

In addition, the Company may work with  \nthe borrower in identifying other changes that\nmitigate loss to the Company, which may       \ninclude additional collateral or guarantees to\nsupport the loan. To a lesser extent, the     \nCompany may waive contractual principal. The  \nCompany classifies all of the above           \nconcessions as TDRs to the extent the Company \ndetermines that the borrower is experiencing  \nfinancial difficulty.                         \n                                              \nModifications for the consumer lending segment\nare generally part of programs the Company has\ninitiated. The Company modifies residential   \nmortgage loans under Federal Housing          \nAdministration, United States Department of   \nVeterans Affairs, or its own internal         \nprograms. Under these programs, the Company   \noffers qualifying homeowners the opportunity  \nto permanently modify their loan and achieve  \nmore affordable monthly payments by providing \nloan concessions. These concessions may       \ninclude adjustments to interest rates,        \nconversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates,\nextension of maturity dates or deferrals of   \npayments, capitalization of accrued interest  \nand/or outstanding advances, or in limited    \nsituations, partial forgiveness of loan       \nprincipal. In most instances, participation in\nresidential mortgage loan restructuring       \nprograms requires the customer to complete a  \nshort-term trial period. A permanent loan     \nmodification is contingent on the customer    \nsuccessfully completing the trial period      \narrangement, and the loan documents are not   \nmodified until that time. The Company reports \nloans in a trial period arrangement as TDRs   \nand continues to report them as TDRs after the\ntrial period.                                 \n                                              \nCredit card and other retail loan TDRs are    \ngenerally part of distinct restructuring      \nprograms providing customers experiencing     \nfinancial difficulty with modifications       \nwhereby balances may be amortized up to 60    \nmonths, and generally include waiver of fees  \nand reduced interest rates.                   \n                      \n  48    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp

The majority of the\nCompany\u2019s financial asset transfers are       \nresidential mortgage loan sales primarily to  \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d),    \ntransfers of tax-advantaged investments,      \ncommercial loan sales through participation   \nagreements, and other individual or portfolio \nloan and securities sales. In accordance with \nthe accounting guidance for asset transfers,  \nthe Company considers any ongoing involvement \nwith transferred assets in determining whether\nthe assets can be derecognized from the       \nbalance sheet. Guarantees provided to certain \nthird parties in connection with the transfer \nof assets are further discussed in Note 16.   \nFor loans sold under participation agreements,\nthe Company also considers whether the terms  \nof the loan participation agreement meet the  \naccounting definition of a participating      \ninterest. With the exception of servicing and \ncertain performance-based guarantees, the     \nCompany\u2019s continuing involvement with         \nfinancial assets sold is minimal and generally\nlimited to market customary representation and\nwarranty clauses. Any gain or loss on sale    \ndepends on the previous carrying amount of the\ntransferred financial assets, the             \nconsideration received, and any liabilities   \nincurred in exchange for the transferred      \nassets. Upon transfer, any servicing assets   \nand other interests that continue to be held  \nby the Company are initially recognized at    \nfair value. For further information on        \nmortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d), refer to  \nNote 7. On a limited basis, the Company may   \nacquire and package high-grade corporate bonds\nfor select corporate customers, in which the  \nCompany generally has no continuing           \ninvolvement with these transactions.          \nAdditionally, the Company is an authorized    \nGNMA issuer and issues GNMA securities on a   \nregular basis. The Company has no other asset \nsecuritizations or similar asset-backed       \nfinancing arrangements that are off-balance   \nsheet.                                        \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    49  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThe Company also provides financial support   \nprimarily through the use of waivers of trust \nand investment management fees associated with\nvarious unconsolidated registered money market\nfunds it manages.

The Company\u2019s investments  \nin VIEs are primarily related to investments  \npromoting affordable housing, community       \ndevelopment and renewable energy sources. Some\nof these tax-advantaged investments support   \nthe Company\u2019s regulatory compliance with the  \nCommunity Reinvestment Act. The Company\u2019s     \ninvestments in these entities generate a      \nreturn primarily through the realization of   \nfederal and state income tax credits, and     \nother tax benefits, such as tax deductions    \nfrom operating losses of the investments, over\nspecified time periods. These tax credits are \nrecognized as a reduction of tax expense or,  \nfor investments qualifying as investment tax  \ncredits, as a reduction to the related        \ninvestment asset. The Company recognized      \nfederal and state income tax credits related  \nto its affordable housing and other tax-      \nadvantaged investments in tax expense of $ 112\nmillion and $ 110 million for the three months\nended June\u00a030, 2022 and 2021, respectively,   \nand $ 225 million and $ 243 million for the   \nsix months ended June\u00a030, 2022 and 2021,      \nrespectively.

The Company recognized $ 106    \nmillion of expenses related to all of these   \ninvestments for both the three months ended   \nJune\u00a030, 2022 and 2021, of which $ 92 million \nand $ 87 million, respectively, were included \nin tax expense and the remaining amounts were \nincluded in noninterest expense.

While the Company believes potential   \nlosses from these investments are remote, the \nmaximum exposure was determined by assuming a \nscenario where the community-based business   \nand housing projects completely fail and do   \nnot meet certain government compliance        \nrequirements resulting in recapture of the    \nrelated tax credits.                          \nThe following table provides a summary of     \ninvestments in community development and tax- \nadvantaged VIEs that the Company has not      \nconsolidated:                                 \n                                              \n  (Dollars                          December  \n  in              June\u00a030,               31,  \n  Millions)           2022              2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Investme\u2026                                   \n  carrying     $     4,999    $        4,484  \n  amount                                      \n  Unfunded                                    \n  capital            2,210             1,890  \n  and other                                   \n  commitme\u2026                                   \n  Maximum                                     \n  exposure           9,872             9,899  \n  to loss                                     \n                                              \nThe Company also has noncontrolling financial \ninvestments in private investment funds and   \npartnerships considered to be VIEs, which are \nnot consolidated.

These amounts     \ncompared to $ 5.0billion and $ 3.4billion,    \nrespectively, at December 31, 2021. The       \nmajority of the assets of these consolidated  \nVIEs are reported in other assets, and the    \nliabilities are reported in long-term debt and\nother liabilities. The assets of a particular \nVIE are the primary source of funds to settle \nits obligations. The creditors of the VIEs do \nnot have recourse to the general credit of the\nCompany. The Company\u2019s exposure to the        \nconsolidated VIEs is generally limited to the \ncarrying value of its variable interests plus \nany related tax credits previously recognized \nor transferred to others with a guarantee. In \naddition, the Company sponsors a municipal    \nbond securities tender option bond program.   \nThe Company controls the activities of the    \nprogram\u2019s entities, is entitled to the        \nresidual returns and provides liquidity and   \nremarketing arrangements to the program. As a \nresult, the Company has consolidated the      \nprogram\u2019s entities. At June 30, 2022, $       \n1.5billion of available-for-saleinvestment    \nsecurities and $ 1.2billion of short-term     \nborrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet  \nwere related to the tender option bond        \nprogram, compared with $ 1.7billion of        \navailable-for-saleinvestment securities and $ \n1.2billion of short-term borrowings at        \nDecember 31, 2021.                            \n                                       \n  Note\u00a07    Mortgage Servicing Rights  \n                                       \nThe Company capitalizes MSRs as separate      \nassets when loans are sold and servicing is   \nretained. MSRs may also be purchased from     \nothers. The Company carries MSRs at fair      \nvalue, with changes in the fair value recorded\nin earnings during the period in which they   \noccur. The Company serviced $ 226.4 billion of\nresidential mortgage loans for others at      \nJune\u00a030, 2022, and $ 222.4 billion at         \nDecember\u00a031, 2021, including subserviced      \nmortgages with no corresponding MSR asset.    \nIncluded in mortgage banking revenue are the  \nMSR fair value changes arising from market    \nrate and model assumption changes, net of the \nvalue change in derivatives used to           \neconomically hedge MSRs. These changes        \nresulted in net gains of $ 13 million and net \nlosses of $ 27 million for the three months   \nended June\u00a030, 2022 and 2021, respectively,   \nand net losses of $ 16 million and $ 147      \nmillion for the six months ended June\u00a030, 2022\nand 2021, respectively. Loan servicing and    \nancillary fees, not including valuation       \nchanges, included in mortgage banking revenue \nwere $ 186 million and $ 178 million for the  \nthree months ended June\u00a030, 2022 and 2021     \nrespectively, and $ 371 million and $ 353     \nmillion for the six months ended June\u00a030, 2022\nand 2021, respectively.                       \nChanges in fair value of capitalized MSRs are \nsummarized as follows:                        \n                                              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026          \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026         \u2026    \n         3          \u2026          6         \u2026    \n         \u2026          \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n         \u2014          1          1         1    \n                                              \n         \u2026          \u2026  )       \u2026         \u2026    \n         6          \u2026  )       \u2026  )      \u2026    \n         \u2026  )       \u2026  )       \u2026  )      \u2026    \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026         \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n       MSRs sold include those having a       \n  (a)  negative fair value, resulting from    \n       the loans being severely delinquent.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Includes changes in MSR value          \n       associated with changes in market      \n  (b)  interest rates, including estimated    \n       prepayment rates and anticipated       \n       earnings on escrow deposits.           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Includes changes in MSR value not      \n       caused by changes in market interest   \n  (c)  rates, such as changes in assumed      \n       cost to service, ancillary income and  \n       option adjusted spread, as well as     \n       the impact of any model changes.       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Primarily the change in MSR value      \n       from passage of time and cash flows    \n       realized (decay), but also includes    \n  (d)  the impact of changes to expected      \n       cash flows not associated with         \n       changes in market interest rates,      \n       such as the impact of delinquencies.   \n                                              \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    51  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThe estimated sensitivity to changes in       \ninterest rates of the fair value of the MSR   \nportfolio and the related derivative          \ninstruments was as follows:                   \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nTh e fair value of MSRs and their sensitivity \nto changes in interest rates is influenced by \nthe mix of the servicing portfolio and        \ncharacteristics of each segment of the        \nportfolio.

As of June\u00a030,  \n2022, federal tax examinations for all years  \nending through December\u00a031, 2014 are completed\nand resolved.

The   \nCompany recognizes all derivatives on the     \nConsolidated Balance Sheet at fair value in   \nother assets or in other liabilities. On the  \ndate the Company enters into a derivative     \ncontract, the derivative is designated as     \neither a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge,   \nnet investment hedge, or a designation is not \nmade as it is a customer-related transaction, \nan economic hedge for asset/liability risk    \nmanagement purposes or another stand-alone    \nderivative created through the Company\u2019s      \noperations (\u201cfree-standing derivative\u201d). When \na derivative is designated as a fair value,   \ncash flow or net investment hedge, the Company\nperforms an assessment, at inception and, at a\nminimum, quarterly thereafter, to determine   \nthe effectiveness of the derivative in        \noffsetting changes in the value or cash flows \nof the hedged item(s).                        \nFair Value Hedges These derivatives are       \ninterest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge \nthe change in fair value related to interest  \nrate changes of its underlying available-for- \nsaleinvestment securities and fixed-rate debt.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives      \ndesignated as fair value hedges, and changes  \nin the fair value of the hedged items, are    \nrecorded in earnings.                         \nCash Flow Hedges These derivatives are        \ninterest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge \nthe forecasted cash flows from its underlying \nvariable-rate loans and debt. Changes in the  \nfair value of derivatives designated as cash  \nflow hedges are recorded in other             \ncomprehensive income (loss) until the cash    \nflows of the hedged items are realized. If a  \nderivative designated as a cash flow hedge is \nterminated or ceases to be highly effective,  \nthe gain or loss in other comprehensive income\n(loss) is amortized to earnings over the      \nperiod the forecasted hedged transactions     \nimpact earnings. If a hedged                  \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    55  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nforecasted transaction is no longer probable, \nhedge accounting is ceased and any gain or    \nloss included in other comprehensive income   \n(loss) is reported in earnings immediately,   \nunless the forecasted transaction is at least \nreasonably possible of occurring, whereby the \namounts remain within other comprehensive     \nincome (loss). At June\u00a030, 2022, the Company  \nhad $ 4 million (net-of-tax) of realized and  \nunrealized gains on derivatives classified as \ncash flow hedges recorded in other            \ncomprehensive income (loss), compared with $  \n85 million (net-of-tax) of realized and       \nunrealized losses at December\u00a031, 2021. The   \nestimated amount to be reclassified from other\ncomprehensive income (loss) into earnings     \nduring the next 12\u00a0months is a loss of $ 15   \nmillion (net-of-tax). All cash flow hedges    \nwere highly effective for the three months    \nended June 30, 2022. There were no derivatives\nheld as cash flow hedges at December\u00a031, 2021.\n                                              \nNet Investment Hedges The Company uses forward\ncommitments to sell specified amounts of      \ncertain foreign currencies, and non-          \nderivativedebt instruments, to hedge the      \nvolatility of its net investment in foreign   \noperations driven by fluctuations in foreign  \ncurrency exchange rates. The carrying amount  \nof non-derivativedebt instruments designated  \nas net investment hedges was $ 1.2billion at  \nJune 30, 2022, compared with $ 1.3billion at  \nDecember 31, 2021.                            \n                                              \nOther Derivative Positions The Company enters \ninto free-standing derivatives to mitigate    \ninterest rate risk and for other risk         \nmanagement purposes. These derivatives include\nforward commitments to sell to-be-            \nannouncedsecurities (\u201cTBAs\u201d) and other        \ncommitments to sell residential mortgage      \nloans, which are used to economically hedge   \nthe interest rate risk related to mortgage    \nloans held for sale (\u201cMLHFS\u201d) and unfunded    \nmortgage loan commitments. The Company also   \nenters into interest rate swaps, swaptions,   \nforward commitments to buy TBAs, U.S. Treasury\nand Eurodollar futures and options on U.S.    \nTreasury futures to economically hedge the    \nchange in the fair value of the Company\u2019s     \nMSRs.

The Company measures    \nthat credit risk using a credit valuation     \nadjustment and includes it within the fair    \nvalue of the derivative. The Company manages  \ncounterparty credit risk through              \ndiversification of its derivative positions   \namong various counterparties, by entering into\nderivative positions that are centrally       \ncleared through clearinghouses, by entering   \ninto master netting arrangements and, where   \npossible, by requiring collateral             \narrangements. A master netting arrangement    \nallows two counterparties, who have multiple  \nderivative contracts with each other, the     \nability to net settle amounts under all       \ncontracts, including any related collateral,  \nthrough a single payment and in a single      \ncurrency. Collateral arrangements generally   \nrequire the counterparty to deliver collateral\n(typically cash or U.S. Treasury and agency   \nsecurities) equal to the Company\u2019s net        \nderivative receivable, subject to minimum     \ntransfer and credit rating requirements.      \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s collateral arrangements are     \npredominately bilateral and, therefore,       \ncontain provisions that require               \ncollateralization of the Company\u2019s net        \nliability derivative positions. Required      \ncollateral coverage is based on net liability \nthresholds and may be contingent upon the     \nCompany\u2019s credit rating from two of the       \nnationally recognized statistical rating      \norganizations. If the Company\u2019s credit rating \nwere to fall below credit ratings thresholds  \nestablished in the collateral arrangements,   \nthe counterparties to the derivatives could   \nrequest immediate additional collateral       \ncoverage up to and including full collateral  \ncoverage for derivatives in a net liability   \nposition. The aggregate fair value of all     \nderivatives under collateral arrangements that\nwere in a net liability position at June\u00a030,  \n2022, was $ 1.5 billion. At June\u00a030, 2022, the\nCompany had $ 1.2 billion of cash posted as   \ncollateral against this net liability         \nposition.                                     \n                                              \n             Netting Arrangements for         \n  Note\u00a014    Certain Financial Instruments    \n             and Securities Financing         \n             Activities                       \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s derivative portfolio consists of\nbilateral over-the-counter trades, certain    \ninterest rate derivatives and credit contracts\nrequired to be centrally cleared through      \nclearinghouses per current regulations, and   \nexchange-traded positions which may include   \nU.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures or       \noptions on U.S. Treasury futures.

The Company\u2019s derivative     \ncontracts typically include offsetting rights \n(referred to as netting arrangements), and    \ndepending on expected volume, credit risk, and\ncounterparty preference, collateral           \nmaintenance may be required. For all          \nderivatives under collateral support          \narrangements, fair value is determined daily  \nand, depending on the collateral maintenance  \nrequirements, the Company and a counterparty  \nmay receive or deliver collateral, based upon \nthe net fair value of all derivative positions\nbetween the Company and the counterparty.     \nCollateral is typically cash, but securities  \nmay be allowed under collateral arrangements  \nwith certain counterparties. Receivables and  \npayables related to cash collateral are       \nincluded in other assets and other liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet, along with \nthe related derivative asset and liability    \nfair values. Any securities pledged to        \ncounterparties as collateral remain on the    \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Securities        \nreceived from counterparties as collateral are\nnot recognized on the Consolidated Balance    \nSheet, unless the counterparty defaults. In   \ngeneral, securities used as collateral can be \nsold, repledged or otherwise used by the party\nin possession. No restrictions exist on the   \nuse of cash collateral by either party. Refer \nto Note 13 for further discussion of the      \nCompany\u2019s derivatives, including collateral   \narrangements. As part of the Company\u2019s        \ntreasury and broker-dealer operations, the    \nCompany executes transactions that are treated\nas securities sold under agreements to        \nrepurchase or securities purchased under      \nagreements to resell, both of which are       \naccounted for as collateralized financings.   \nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase\ninclude repurchase agreements and securities  \nloaned transactions. Securities purchased     \nunder agreements to resell include reverse    \nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed \ntransactions. For securities sold under       \nagreements to repurchase, the Company records \na liability for the cash received, which is   \nincluded in short-term borrowings on the      \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. For securities    \npurchased under agreements to resell, the     \nCompany records a receivable for the cash     \npaid, which is included in other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Securities        \ntransferred to counterparties under repurchase\nagreements and securities loaned transactions \ncontinue to be recognized on the Consolidated \nBalance Sheet, are measured at fair value, and\nare included in investment securities or other\nassets. Securities received from              \ncounterparties under reverse repurchase       \nagreements and securities borrowed            \ntransactions are not recognized on the        \nConsolidated Balance Sheet unless the         \ncounterparty defaults. The securities         \ntransferred under repurchase and reverse      \nrepurchase transactions typically are U.S.    \nTreasury and agency securities, residential   \nagency mortgage-backed securities or corporate\ndebt securities. The securities loaned or     \nborrowed typically are corporate debt         \nsecurities traded by the Company\u2019s broker-    \ndealer subsidiary. In general, the securities \ntransferred can be sold, repledged or         \notherwise used by the party in possession. No \nrestrictions exist on the use of cash         \ncollateral by either party. Repurchase/reverse\nrepurchase and securities loaned/borrowed     \ntransactions expose the Company to            \ncounterparty risk. The Company manages this   \nrisk by performing assessments, independent of\nbusiness line managers, and establishing      \nconcentration limits on each counterparty.    \nAdditionally, these transactions include      \ncollateral arrangements that require the fair \nvalues of the underlying securities to be     \ndetermined daily, resulting in cash being     \nobtained or refunded to counterparties to     \nmaintain specified collateral levels.         \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    59  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the maturities \nby category of collateral pledged for         \nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned   \ntransactions:                                 \n                                              \n                 \u2026                \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026                \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026                \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       T\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  4\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       9\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       5\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       2\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  2\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  3\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       5\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       6\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  1\u2026  \n                                              \nThe Company executes its derivative,          \nrepurchase/reverse repurchase and securities  \nloaned/borrowed transactions under the        \nrespective industry standard agreements.

Additionally, from time to   \ntime, the Company may be required to record at\nfair value other assets on a nonrecurring     \nbasis, such as loans held for sale, loans held\nfor investment and certain other assets. These\nnonrecurring fair value adjustments typically \ninvolve application of lower-of-cost-or-fair  \nvalue accounting or impairment write-downs of \nindividual assets.                            \nFair value is defined as the exchange price   \nthat would be received for an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability (an exit price) in the   \nprincipal or most advantageous market for the \nasset or liability in an orderly transaction  \nbetween market participants on the measurement\ndate. A fair value measurement reflects all of\nthe assumptions that market participants would\nuse in pricing the asset or liability,        \nincluding assumptions about the risk inherent \nin a particular valuation technique, the      \neffect of a restriction on the sale or use of \nan asset and the risk of nonperformance.      \nThe Company groups its assets and liabilities \nmeasured at fair value into a three-level     \nhierarchy for valuation techniques used to    \nmeasure financial assets and financial        \nliabilities at fair value. This hierarchy is  \nbased on whether the valuation inputs are     \nobservable or unobservable. These levels are: \n                                              \n       Level\u00a01 \u2014 Quoted prices in active      \n       markets for identical assets or        \n  \u2022    liabilities. Level\u00a01 includes U.S.     \n       Treasury securities, as well as        \n       exchange-traded instruments.           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Level\u00a02 \u2014 Observable inputs other      \n       than Level\u00a01 prices, such as quoted    \n       prices for similar assets or           \n       liabilities; quoted prices in markets  \n       that are not active; or other inputs   \n       that are observable or can be          \n       corroborated by observable market      \n       data for substantially the full term   \n       of the assets or liabilities. Level\u00a02  \n       includes debt securities that are      \n       traded less frequently than            \n       exchange-traded instruments and which  \n       are typically valued using third       \n  \u2022    party pricing services; derivative     \n       contracts and other assets and         \n       liabilities, including securities,     \n       whose value is determined using a      \n       pricing model with inputs that are     \n       observable in the market or can be     \n       derived principally from or            \n       corroborated by observable market      \n       data; and MLHFS whose values are       \n       determined using quoted prices for     \n       similar assets or pricing models with  \n       inputs that are observable in the      \n       market or can be corroborated by       \n       observable market data.                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Level\u00a03 \u2014 Unobservable inputs that     \n       are supported by little or no market   \n       activity and that are significant to   \n       the fair value of the assets or        \n       liabilities. Level\u00a03 assets and        \n       liabilities include financial          \n       instruments whose values are           \n  \u2022    determined using pricing models,       \n       discounted cash flow methodologies,    \n       or similar techniques, as well as      \n       instruments for which the              \n       determination of fair value requires   \n       significant management judgment or     \n       estimation. This category includes     \n       MSRs and certain derivative            \n       contracts.                             \n                                              \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    61  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nValuation Methodologies The valuation         \nmethodologies used by the Company to measure  \nfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value\nare described below. In addition, the         \nfollowing section includes an indication of   \nthe level of the fair value hierarchy in which\nthe assets or liabilities are classified.     \nWhere appropriate, the descriptions include   \ninformation about the valuation models and key\ninputs to those models. During the six months \nended June 30, 2022 and 2021, there were no   \nsignificant changes to the valuation          \ntechniques used by the Company to measure fair\nvalue. Available-For-SaleInvestment Securities\nWhen quoted market prices for identical       \nsecurities are available in an active market, \nthese prices are used to determine fair value \nand these securities are classified within    \nLevel 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 1  \ninvestment securities include U.S. Treasury   \nand exchange-traded securities. For other     \nsecurities, quoted market prices may not be   \nreadily available for the specific securities.\nWhen possible, the Company determines fair    \nvalue based on market observable information, \nincluding quoted market prices for similar    \nsecurities, inactive transaction prices, and  \nbroker quotes. These securities are classified\nwithin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.   \nLevel 2 valuations are generally provided by a\nthird-party pricing service. Level 2          \ninvestment securities are predominantly agency\nmortgage-backed securities, certain other     \nasset-backed securities, obligations of state \nand political subdivisions and agency debt    \nsecurities. Mortgage Loans Held For Sale MLHFS\nmeasured at fair value, for which an active   \nsecondary market and readily available market \nprices exist, are initially valued at the     \ntransaction price and are subsequently valued \nby comparison to instruments with similar     \ncollateral and risk profiles. MLHFS are       \nclassified within Level 2. Included in        \nmortgage banking revenue was a net loss of $  \n64million and a net gain of $ 98million for   \nthe three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, and net losses of $ 298million  \nand $ 117million for the six months ended June\n30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, from the     \nchanges to fair value of these MLHFS under    \nfair value option accounting guidance. Changes\nin fair value due to instrument specific      \ncredit risk were immaterial. Interest income  \nfor MLHFS is measured based on contractual    \ninterest rates and reported as interest income\non the Consolidated Statement of Income.      \nElecting to measure MLHFS at fair value       \nreduces certain timing differences and better \nmatches changes in fair value of these assets \nwith changes in the value of the derivative   \ninstruments used to economically hedge them   \nwithout the burden of complying with the      \nrequirements for hedge accounting. Mortgage   \nServicing Rights MSRs are valued using a      \ndiscounted cash flow methodology, and are     \nclassified within Level 3. The Company        \ndetermines fair value of the MSRs by          \nprojecting future cash flows for different    \ninterest rate scenarios using prepayment rates\nand other assumptions, and discounts these    \ncash flows using a risk adjusted rate based on\noption adjusted spread levels. There is       \nminimal observable market activity for MSRs on\ncomparable portfolios and, therefore, the     \ndetermination of fair value requires          \nsignificant management judgment. Refer to Note\n7 for further information on MSR valuation    \nassumptions. Derivatives The majority of      \nderivatives held by the Company are executed  \nover-the-counteror centrally cleared through  \nclearinghouses and are valued using market    \nstandard cash flow valuation techniques. The  \nmodels incorporate inputs, depending on the   \ntype of derivative, including interest rate   \ncurves, foreign exchange rates and volatility.\nAll derivative values incorporate an          \nassessment of the risk of counterparty        \nnonperformance, measured based on the         \nCompany\u2019s evaluation of credit risk including \nexternal assessments of credit risk. The      \nCompany monitors and manages its              \nnonperformance risk by considering its ability\nto net derivative positions under master      \nnetting arrangements, as well as collateral   \nreceived or provided under collateral         \narrangements. Accordingly, the Company has    \nelected to measure the fair value of          \nderivatives, at a counterparty level, on a net\nbasis. The majority of the derivatives are    \nclassified within Level 2 of the fair value   \nhierarchy, as the significant inputs to the   \nmodels, including nonperformance risk, are    \nobservable. However, certain derivative       \ntransactions are with counterparties where    \nrisk of nonperformance cannot be observed in  \nthe market and, therefore, the credit         \nvaluation adjustments result in these         \nderivatives being classified within Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy. The Company also has\nother derivative contracts that are created   \nthrough its operations, including commitments \nto purchase and originate mortgage loans and  \nswap agreements executed in conjunction with  \nthe sale of a portion of its Class B common   \nand preferred shares of Visa Inc. (the \u201cVisa  \nswaps\u201d). The mortgage loan commitments are    \nvalued by pricing models that include market  \nobservable and unobservable inputs, which     \nresult in the commitments being classified    \nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.   \nThe unobservable inputs include assumptions   \nabout the percentage of commitments that      \nactually become a closed loan and the MSR     \nvalue that is inherent in the underlying loan \nvalue.                                        \n                      \n  62    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThe Visa swaps require payments by either the \nCompany or the purchaser of the Visa Inc.     \nClass\u00a0B common and preferred shares when there\nare changes in the conversion rate of the Visa\nInc. Class\u00a0B common and preferred shares to   \nVisa Inc. Class\u00a0A common and preferred shares,\nrespectively, as well as quarterly payments to\nthe purchaser based on specified terms of the \nagreements. Management reviews and updates the\nVisa swaps fair value in conjunction with its \nreview of Visa Inc. related litigation        \ncontingencies, and the associated escrow      \nfunding. The expected litigation resolution   \nimpacts the Visa Inc. Class\u00a0B common share to \nVisa Inc. Class\u00a0A common share conversion     \nrate, as well as the ultimate termination date\nfor the Visa swaps. Accordingly, the Visa     \nswaps are classified within Level\u00a03.

The  \ndiscussion below excludes nonrecurring fair   \nvalue measurements of collateral value used   \nfor impairment measures for loans and OREO.   \nThese valuations utilize third party appraisal\nor broker price opinions, and are classified  \nas Level\u00a03 due to the significant judgment    \ninvolved.                                     \n                                              \nMortgage Servicing Rights The significant     \nunobservable inputs used in the fair value    \nmeasurement of the Company\u2019s MSRs are expected\nprepayments and the option adjusted spread    \nthat is added to the risk-free rate to        \ndiscount projected cash flows. Significant    \nincreases in either of these inputs in        \nisolation would have resulted in a            \nsignificantly lower fair value measurement.   \nSignificant decreases in either of these      \ninputs in isolation would have resulted in a  \nsignificantly higher fair value measurement.  \nThere is no direct interrelationship between  \nprepayments and option adjusted spread.       \nPrepayment rates generally move in the        \nopposite direction of market interest rates.  \nOption adjusted spread is generally impacted  \nby changes in market return requirements.     \nThe following table shows the significant     \nvaluation assumption ranges for MSRs at       \nJune\u00a030, 2022:                                \n                                              \n                                   Weigh\u2026     \n          Minim\u2026       Maxi\u2026       Avera\u2026     \n                                      (a)     \n  Exp\u2026         5  %       10  %         7  %  \n  pre\u2026                                        \n  Opt\u2026                                        \n  adj\u2026         5          11            6     \n  spr\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Determined based on the relative fair  \n  (a)  value of the related mortgage loans    \n       serviced.                              \n                                              \nDerivatives The Company has two distinct Level\n3 derivative portfolios: (i) the Company\u2019s    \ncommitments to purchase and originate mortgage\nloans that meet the requirements of a         \nderivative and (ii) the Company\u2019s             \nasset/liability and customer-related          \nderivatives that are Level 3 due to           \nunobservable inputs related to measurement of \nrisk of nonperformance by the counterparty.

A significant increase \nin the rate of loans that close would have    \nresulted in a larger derivative asset or      \nliability.

Inc. card association \nor its affiliates (collectively \u201cVisa\u201d). In   \n2007, Visa completed a restructuring and      \nissued shares of Visa Inc. common stock to its\nfinancial institution members in contemplation\nof its initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d)        \ncompleted in the first quarter of 2008 (the   \n\u201cVisa Reorganization\u201d). As a part of the Visa \nReorganization, the Company received its      \nproportionate number of shares of Visa Inc.   \ncommon stock, which were subsequently         \nconverted to Class B shares of Visa Inc.      \n(\u201cClass B shares\u201d).                           \nVisa U.S.A. Inc. (\u201cVisa U.S.A.\u201d) and          \nMasterCard International (collectively, the   \n\u201cCard Brands\u201d) are defendants in antitrust    \nlawsuits challenging the practices of the Card\nBrands (the \u201cVisa Litigation\u201d). Visa U.S.A.   \nmember banks have a contingent obligation to  \nindemnify Visa Inc. under the Visa U.S.A.     \nbylaws (which were modified at the time of the\nrestructuring in October 2007) for potential  \nlosses arising from the Visa Litigation. The  \nindemnification by the Visa U.S.A. member     \nbanks has no specific maximum amount. Using   \nproceeds from its IPO and through reductions  \nto the conversion ratio applicable to the     \nClass\u00a0B shares held by Visa U.S.A. member     \nbanks, Visa Inc. has funded an escrow account \nfor the benefit of member financial           \ninstitutions to fund their indemnification    \nobligations associated with the Visa          \nLitigation. The receivable related to the     \nescrow account is classified in other         \nliabilities as a direct offset to the related \nVisa Litigation contingent liability.         \nIn October 2012, Visa signed a settlement     \nagreement to resolve class action claims      \nassociated with the multidistrict interchange \nlitigation pending in the United States       \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork (the \u201cMulti-District Litigation\u201d). The   \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit  \nreversed the approval of that settlement and  \nremanded the matter to the district court.    \nThereafter, the case was split into two       \nputative class actions, one seeking damages   \n(the \u201cDamages Action\u201d) and a separate class   \naction seeking injunctive relief only (the    \n\u201cInjunctive Action\u201d). In September 2018, Visa \nsigned a new settlement agreement, superseding\nthe original settlement agreement, to resolve \nthe Damages Action. The Damages Action        \nsettlement was approved by the United States  \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork, but is now on appeal. The Injunctive    \nAction, which generally seeks changes to Visa \nrules, is still pending.                      \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    67  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nOther Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities   \nThe following table is a summary of other     \nguarantees and contingent liabilities of the  \nCompany at June\u00a030, 2022:                     \n                                              \n                                   Maxi\u2026      \n  (D\u2026                              Pote\u2026      \n  in        Coll\u2026       Car\u2026       Futu\u2026      \n  Mi\u2026        Held       Amo\u2026       Paym\u2026      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  St\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026    $      \u2014    $    55    $  9,844      \n  of                                          \n  cr\u2026                                         \n  Th\u2026                                         \n  pa\u2026           \u2014          \u2014           7      \n  bo\u2026                                         \n  ar\u2026                                         \n  Se\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026       7,822          \u2014       7,461      \n  in\u2026                                         \n  As\u2026           \u2014         85       7,629  -a  \n  sa\u2026                                         \n  Me\u2026       1,415        118       141,\u2026      \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  Te\u2026                                         \n  op\u2026                                         \n  bo\u2026       1,521          \u2014       1,489      \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  gu\u2026                                         \n  Ot\u2026           \u2014         21       1,343      \n                                              \n                                              \n       The maximum potential future payments  \n       do not include loan sales where the    \n       Company provides standard              \n       representation and warranties to the   \n       buyer against losses related to loan   \n       underwriting documentation defects     \n       that may have existed at the time of   \n       sale that generally are identified     \n       after the occurrence of a triggering   \n       event such as delinquency. For these   \n  (a)  types of loan sales, the maximum       \n       potential future payments is           \n       generally the unpaid principal         \n       balance of loans sold measured at the  \n       end of the current reporting period.   \n       Actual losses will be significantly    \n       less than the maximum exposure, as     \n       only a fraction of loans sold will     \n       have a representation and warranty     \n       breach, and any losses on repurchase   \n       would generally be mitigated by any    \n       collateral held against the loans.     \n                                              \nMerchant Processing The Company, through its  \nsubsidiaries, provides merchant processing    \nservices. Under the rules of credit card      \nassociations, a merchant processor retains a  \ncontingent liability for credit card          \ntransactions processed. This contingent       \nliability arises in the event of a billing    \ndispute between the merchant and a cardholder \nthat is ultimately resolved in the            \ncardholder\u2019s favor. In this situation, the    \ntransaction is \u201ccharged-back\u201d to the merchant \nand the disputed amount is credited or        \notherwise refunded to the cardholder. If the  \nCompany is unable to collect this amount from \nthe merchant, it bears the loss for the amount\nof the refund paid to the cardholder.         \n                                              \nThe Company currently processes card          \ntransactions in the United States, Canada and \nEurope through wholly-owned subsidiaries. In  \nthe event a merchant was unable to fulfill    \nproduct or services subject to future         \ndelivery, such as airline tickets, the Company\ncould become financially liable for refunding \nthe purchase price of such products or        \nservices purchased through the credit card    \nassociations under the charge-back provisions.\nCharge-back risk related to these merchants is\nevaluated in a manner similar to credit risk  \nassessments and, as such, merchant processing \ncontracts contain various provisions to       \nprotect the Company in the event of default.  \nAt June\u00a030, 2022, the value of airline tickets\npurchased to be delivered at a future date    \nthrough card transactions processed by the    \nCompany was $ 9.1 billion. The Company held   \ncollateral of $ 1.2 billion in escrow         \ndeposits, letters of credit and indemnities   \nfrom financial institutions, and liens on     \nvarious assets. In addition to specific       \ncollateral or other credit enhancements, the  \nCompany maintains a liability for its implied \nguarantees associated with future delivery. At\nJune\u00a030, 2022, the liability was $ 100 million\nprimarily related to these airline processing \narrangements.                                 \n                                              \nAsset Sales The Company regularly sells loans \nto GSEs as part of its mortgage banking       \nactivities. The Company provides customary    \nrepresentations and warranties to GSEs in     \nconjunction with these sales. These           \nrepresentations and warranties generally      \nrequire the Company to repurchase assets if it\nis subsequently determined that a loan did not\nmeet specified criteria, such as a            \ndocumentation deficiency or rescission of     \nmortgage insurance. If the Company is unable  \nto cure or refute a repurchase request, the   \nCompany is generally obligated to repurchase  \nthe loan or otherwise reimburse the GSE for   \nlosses. At June 30, 2022, the Company had     \nreserved $ 13million for potential losses from\nrepresentation and warranty obligations,      \ncompared with $ 18million at December 31,     \n2021. The Company\u2019s reserve reflects          \nmanagement\u2019s best estimate of losses for      \nrepresentation and warranty obligations. The  \nCompany\u2019s repurchase reserve is modeled at the\nloan level, taking into consideration the     \nindividual credit quality and borrower        \nactivity that has transpired since            \norigination. The model applies credit quality \nand economic risk factors to derive a         \nprobability of default and potential          \nrepurchase that are based on the Company\u2019s    \nhistorical loss experience, and estimates loss\nseverity based on expected collateral value.  \nThe Company also considers qualitative factors\nthat may result in anticipated losses         \ndiffering from historical loss trends.        \n                                              \nAs of June\u00a030, 2022 and December\u00a031, 2021, the\nCompany had $ 35 million and $ 19 million,    \nrespectively, of unresolved representation and\nwarranty claims from GSEs. The Company does   \nnot have a significant amount of unresolved   \nclaims from investors other than GSEs.        \n                      \n  68    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters The Company \nis subject to various litigation and          \nregulatory matters that arise in the ordinary \ncourse of its business. The Company           \nestablishes reserves for such matters when    \npotential losses become probable and can be   \nreasonably estimated. The Company believes the\nultimate resolution of existing legal and     \nregulatory matters will not have a material   \nadverse effect on the financial condition,    \nresults of operations or cash flows of the    \nCompany. However, in light of the             \nuncertainties inherent in these matters, it is\npossible that the ultimate resolution of one  \nor more of these matters may have a material  \nadverse effect on the Company\u2019s results from  \noperations for a particular period, and future\nchanges in circumstances or additional        \ninformation could result in additional        \naccruals or resolution in excess of           \nestablished accruals, which could adversely   \naffect the Company\u2019s results from operations, \npotentially materially. Residential Mortgage- \nBacked Securities Litigation Starting in 2011,\nthe Company and other large financial         \ninstitutions have been sued in their capacity \nas trustee for residential mortgage\u2013backed    \nsecurities trusts. In the lawsuits brought    \nagainst the Company, the investors allege that\nthe Company\u2019s banking subsidiary, U.S. Bank   \nNational Association (\u201cU.S. Bank\u201d), as trustee\ncaused them to incur substantial losses by    \nfailing to enforce loan repurchase obligations\nand failing to abide by appropriate standards \nof care after events of default allegedly     \noccurred. The plaintiffs in these matters seek\nmonetary damages in unspecified amounts and   \nmost also seek equitable relief. Regulatory   \nMatters The Company is continually subject to \nexaminations, inquiries and investigations in \nareas of heightened regulatory scrutiny, such \nas compliance, risk management, third-party   \nrisk management and consumer protection. The  \nCompany is cooperating fully with all pending \nexaminations, inquiries and investigations,   \nany of which could lead to administrative or  \nlegal proceedings or settlements. Remedies in \nthese proceedings or settlements may include  \nfines, penalties, restitution or alterations  \nin the Company\u2019s business practices (which may\nincrease the Company\u2019s operating expenses and \ndecrease its revenue). On July 27, 2022, U.S. \nBank agreed to the issuance of a consent order\nwith the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \nresolving the previously disclosed            \ninvestigation of certain of the Company\u2019s     \nconsumer sales practices. The financial impact\nof the resolution was not material to the     \nCompany\u2019s financial condition, results of     \noperations or cash flows. Outlook Due to their\ncomplex nature, it can be years before        \nlitigation and regulatory matters are         \nresolved. The Company may be unable to develop\nan estimate or range of loss where matters are\nin early stages, there are significant factual\nor legal issues to be resolved, damages are   \nunspecified or uncertain, or there is         \nuncertainty as to a litigation class being    \ncertified or the outcome of pending motions,  \nappeals or proceedings. For those litigation  \nand regulatory matters where the Company has  \ninformation to develop an estimate or range of\nloss, the Company believes the upper end of   \nthe range of reasonably possible losses in    \naggregate, in excess of any reserves          \nestablished for matters where a loss is       \nconsidered probable, will not be material to  \nits financial condition, results of operations\nor cash flows. The Company\u2019s estimates are    \nsubject to significant judgment and           \nuncertainties, and the matters underlying the \nestimates will change from time to time.      \nActual results may vary significantly from the\ncurrent estimates.                            \n                                 \n  Note\u00a0\u00a017    Business Segments  \n                                 \nWithin the Company, financial performance is  \nmeasured by major lines of business based on  \nthe products and services provided to         \ncustomers through its distribution channels.  \nThese operating segments are components of the\nCompany about which financial information is  \nprepared and is evaluated regularly by        \nmanagement in deciding how to allocate        \nresources and assess performance. The Company \nhas five reportable operating segments:       \nCorporate and Commercial Banking Corporate and\nCommercial Banking offers lending, equipment  \nfinance and small-ticket leasing, depository  \nservices, treasury management, capital markets\nservices, international trade services and    \nother financial services to middle market,    \nlarge corporate, commercial real estate,      \nfinancial institution, non-profitand public   \nsector clients.                               \nConsumer and Business Banking Consumer and    \nBusiness Banking delivers products and        \nservices through banking offices, telephone   \nservicing and sales, on-lineservices, direct  \nmail, ATM processing and mobile devices.

Payment Services Payment Services   \nincludes consumer and business credit cards,  \nstored-value cards, debit cards, corporate,   \ngovernment and purchasing card services,      \nconsumer lines of credit and merchant         \nprocessing. Treasury and Corporate Support    \nTreasury and Corporate Support includes the   \nCompany\u2019s investment portfolios, funding,     \ncapital management, interest rate risk        \nmanagement, income taxes not allocated to     \nbusiness segments, including most investments \nin tax-advantagedprojects, and the residual   \naggregate of those expenses associated with   \ncorporate activities that are managed on a    \nconsolidated basis. Basis of Presentation     \nBusiness segment results are derived from the \nCompany\u2019s business unit profitability         \nreporting systems by specifically attributing \nmanaged balance sheet assets, deposits and    \nother liabilities and their related income or \nexpense. The allowance for credit losses and  \nrelated provision expense are allocated to the\nbusiness segments according to the volume and \ncredit quality of the loan balances managed,  \nbut with the impact of changes in economic    \nforecasts recorded in Treasury and Corporate  \nSupport. Goodwill and other intangible assets \nare assigned to the business segments based on\nthe mix of business of an entity acquired by  \nthe Company. Within the Company, capital      \nlevels are evaluated and managed centrally;   \nhowever, capital is allocated to the business \nsegments to support evaluation of business    \nperformance. Business segments are allocated  \ncapital on a risk-adjusted basis considering  \neconomic and regulatory capital requirements. \nGenerally, the determination of the amount of \ncapital allocated to each business segment    \nincludes credit allocations following a Basel \nIII regulatory framework. Interest income and \nexpense is determined based on the assets and \nliabilities managed by the business segment.  \nBecause funding and asset/liability management\nis a central function, funds transfer-pricing \nmethodologies are utilized to allocate a cost \nof funds used or credit for funds provided to \nall business segment assets and liabilities,  \nrespectively, using a matched funding concept.\nAlso, each business unit is allocated the     \ntaxable-equivalent benefit of tax-            \nexemptproducts. The residual effect on net    \ninterest income of asset/ liability management\nactivities is included in Treasury and        \nCorporate Support. Noninterest income and     \nexpenses directly managed by each business    \nsegment, including fees, service charges,     \nsalaries and benefits, and other direct       \nrevenues and costs are accounted for within   \neach segment\u2019s financial results in a manner  \nsimilar to the consolidated financial         \nstatements. Occupancy costs are allocated     \nbased on utilization of facilities by the     \nbusiness segments. Generally, operating losses\nare charged to the business segment when the  \nloss event is realized in a manner similar to \na loan charge-off.Noninterest expenses        \nincurred by centrally managed operations or   \nbusiness segments that directly support       \nanother business segment\u2019s operations are     \ncharged to the applicable business segment    \nbased on its utilization of those services,   \nprimarily measured by the volume of customer  \nactivities, number of employees or other      \nrelevant factors. These allocated expenses are\nreported as net shared services expense within\nnoninterest expense. Certain activities that  \ndo not directly support the operations of the \nbusiness segments or for which the business   \nsegments are not considered financially       \naccountable in evaluating their performance   \nare not charged to the business segments. The \nincome or expenses associated with these      \ncorporate activities, including merger and    \nintegration charges, are reported within the  \nTreasury and Corporate Support business       \nsegment. Income taxes are assessed to each    \nbusiness segment at a standard tax rate with  \nthe residual tax expense or benefit to arrive \nat the consolidated effective tax rate        \nincluded in Treasury and Corporate Support.   \nDesignations, assignments and allocations     \nchange from time to time as management systems\nare enhanced, methods of evaluating           \nperformance or product lines change or        \nbusiness segments are realigned to better     \nrespond to the Company\u2019s diverse customer     \nbase. During 2022, certain organization and   \nmethodology changes were made and,            \naccordingly, 2021 results were restated and   \npresented on a comparable basis.              \n
