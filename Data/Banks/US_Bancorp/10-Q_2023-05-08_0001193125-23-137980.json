                                     \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis OVERVIEW \nEarnings Summary U.S. Bancorp and its         \nsubsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) reported net     \nincome attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $1.7   \nbillion for the first quarter of 2023, or     \n$1.04 per diluted common share, compared with \n$1.6 billion, or $0.99 per diluted common     \nshare, for the first quarter of 2022. Return  \non average assets and return on average common\nequity were 1.03 percent and 14.1 percent,    \nrespectively, for the first quarter of 2023,  \ncompared with 1.09 percent and 12.7 percent,  \nrespectively, for the first quarter of 2022.  \nThe results for the first quarter of 2023     \nincluded the impact of $244 million ($183     \nmillion net-of-tax) of merger and integration-\nrelated charges associated with the           \nacquisition of MUFG Union Bank, N.A. (\u201cMUB\u201d), \nwhich decreased diluted earnings per common   \nshare by $0.12. Total net revenue for the     \nfirst quarter of 2023 was $1.6 billion (28.2  \npercent) higher than the first quarter of     \n2022, reflecting a 46.0 percent increase in   \nnet interest income (45.9 percent on a        \ntaxable-equivalent basis) and a 4.6 percent   \nincrease in noninterest income. The increase  \nin net interest income from the first quarter \nof 2022 was due to the impact of rising       \ninterest rates on earning assets and the      \nimpacts of the MUB acquisition. The increase  \nin noninterest income reflected higher payment\nservices revenue, trust and investment        \nmanagement fees, and commercial products      \nrevenue, partially offset by lower mortgage   \nbanking revenue and losses on securities.     \nNoninterest expense in the first quarter of   \n2023 was $1.1 billion (30.1 percent) higher   \nthan the first quarter of 2022, reflecting    \nmerger and integration charges and operating  \nexpenses related to the MUB acquisition,      \nincluding core deposit intangible amortization\nexpense, as well as increases in legacy       \ncompensation and employee benefits expense to \nsupport business growth. The provision for    \ncredit losses for the first quarter of 2023 of\n$427 million was $315 million higher than the \nfirst quarter of 2022, driven by the          \nacquisition of MUB, normalizing credit losses \nand continued economic uncertainty. Net       \ncharge-offs in the first quarter of 2023 were \n$373 million, compared with $162 million in   \nthe first quarter of 2022. Refer to \u201cCorporate\nRisk Profile\u201d for further information on the  \nprovision for credit losses, net charge-offs, \nnonperforming assets and other factors        \nconsidered by the Company in assessing the    \ncredit quality of the loan portfolio and      \nestablishing the allowance for credit losses. \nRecent Industry Events Disruption in the      \nbanking industry in early March of 2023       \nresulted in significant deposit run-off at    \ncertain banking institutions and reinforced   \nthe importance of maintaining a well-         \ndiversified business with an appropriate risk \nprofile. The Company\u2019s resilient and          \ndiversified deposit base, ample liquidity     \nlevels and strong credit quality, supported by\ndisciplined underwriting standards, are all   \naspects of the Company\u2019s approach to strong   \nrisk management. Key highlights included:     \n                                              \n       From the beginning of the industry     \n       disruption on March 8, 2023, through   \n       the end of the first quarter, total    \n       deposit balances were relatively       \n  \u2022    stable, decreasing only 0.6 percent.   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Subsequent to March 31, 2023 and       \n       through April 30, 2023, total deposit  \n       balances decreased approximately $17   \n  \u2022    billion, of which $10 billion was      \n       related to seasonal corporate trust    \n       fluctuations, and $3 billion was       \n       related to transitional MUB deposits.  \n                                              \n                                              \n       At March 31, 2023, the Company\u2019s       \n       percent of insured deposits to total   \n       deposits was approximately 51          \n       percent, with approximately 80         \n       percent of uninsured deposits          \n       comprised of operational wholesale     \n       trust and retail deposits, which tend  \n       to be more stable as customers are     \n       contractually bound or tied to         \n       treasury management services and       \n       trust activities provided to           \n  \u2022    corporate and institutional clients.   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n       At March 31, 2023, the Company\u2019s       \n       total available liquidity was          \n  \u2022    approximately $315 billion,            \n       representing approximately 126         \n       percent of uninsured deposits.         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Over the last five quarters, and well  \n       ahead of the recent banking industry   \n       disruption, the Company reduced its    \n  \u2022    investment securities portfolio from   \n       approximately 30 percent to 25         \n       percent of total assets, while         \n       increasing cash levels.                \n                                              \nMUFG Union Bank Acquisition On December 1,    \n2022, the Company acquired MUB\u2019s core regional\nbanking franchise from Mitsubishi UFJ         \nFinancial Group, Inc.

The transaction excluded  \nthe purchase of substantially all of MUB\u2019s    \nGlobal Corporate & Investment Bank (other than\ncertain deposits), certain middle and back-   \noffice functions, and other assets. MUB       \noperates approximately 300 branches in        \nCalifornia, Washington and Oregon. The        \nCompany\u2019s first quarter of 2023 results       \nreflect the full benefit of the acquisition   \ninto the reported results. As of the date of  \nacquisition, MUB is a wholly-owned subsidiary \nof the Company and an affiliate of U.S. Bank  \nNational Association (\u201cUSBNA\u201d), the Company\u2019s \nprimary banking subsidiary. The Company       \nexpects to merge MUB into USBNA in connection \nwith the conversion of MUB customers and      \nsystems to the USBNA platform over Memorial   \nDay weekend in 2023. STATEMENT OF INCOME      \nANALYSIS Net Interest Income Net interest     \nincome, on a taxable-equivalent basis, was    \n$4.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023,    \nrepresenting an increase of $1.5 billion (45.9\npercent) compared with the first quarter of   \n2022. The increase was primarily due to the   \nimpact of rising interest rates on earning    \nassets and the acquisition of MUB. Average    \nearning assets were $77.8 billion (14.7       \npercent) higher than the first quarter of     \n2022, reflecting increases in loans and       \ninterest-bearing deposits with banks,         \npartially offset by a decrease in investment  \nsecurities. The net interest margin, on a     \ntaxable-equivalent basis, in the first quarter\nof 2023 was 3.10 percent, compared with 2.44  \npercent in the first quarter of 2022. The     \nincrease in net interest margin from the first\nquarter of 2022 was primarily due to the      \nimpact of higher rates on earning assets and  \nthe acquisition of MUB. Refer to the          \n\u201cConsolidated Daily Average Balance Sheet and \nRelated Yields and Rates\u201d table for further   \ninformation on net interest income. Average   \ntotal loans in the first quarter of 2023 were \n$73.8 billion (23.6 percent) higher than the  \nfirst quarter of 2022. The increase was driven\nby growth in the Company\u2019s legacy loan        \nportfolio as well as $52.8 billion in average \nloan balances from the MUB acquisition.       \nIncreases in residential mortgages (50.1      \npercent), commercial loans (21.7 percent),    \ncommercial real estate loans (42.2 percent)   \nand credit card loans (17.1 percent) were     \npartially offset by lower other retail loans  \n(13.2 percent). The increase in residential   \nmortgages was driven by the impact related to \nthe MUB acquisition, along with on-balance    \nsheet loan activities and slower refinancing  \nactivity. The increase in commercial loans was\ndue to higher utilization driven by working   \ncapital needs of corporate customers, slower  \npayoffs given higher volatility in the capital\nmarkets, as well as core growth and the impact\nrelated to the MUB acquisition. The increase  \nin commercial real estate loans was driven by \nthe impact of the MUB acquisition, while the  \nincrease in credit cards loans was primarily  \ndriven by higher spend volumes, account growth\nand lower payment rates. The decrease in other\nretail loans was driven by lower auto and     \ninstallment loans and lower retail leasing    \nbalances, partially offset by higher home     \nequity and second mortgages. Average          \ninvestment securities in the first quarter of \n2023 were $8.6 billion (4.9 percent) lower    \nthan the first quarter of 2022, driven by     \nbalance sheet repositioning and liquidity     \nmanagement in connection with the acquisition \nof MUB. The decrease from the first quarter of\n2022 reflected sales of investments           \nsecurities, partially offset by the impact of \nacquired MUB investment securities. Average   \ntotal deposits for the first quarter of 2023  \nwere $56.1 billion (12.4 percent) higher than \nthe first quarter of 2022. Average total      \nsavings deposits for the first quarter of 2023\nwere $43.5 billion (14.4 percent) higher than \nthe first quarter of 2022, driven by the      \nacquisition of MUB and increases in Corporate \nand Commercial Banking, and Wealth Management \nand Investment Services balances, partially   \noffset by a decrease in Consumer and Business \nBanking balances. Average time deposits were  \n$10.9 billion (44.1 percent) higher than the  \nprior year, mainly due to the acquisition of  \nMUB and an increase in Consumer and Business  \nBanking balances. Changes in time deposits are\nprimarily related to those deposits managed as\nan alternative to other funding sources, based\nlargely on relative pricing and liquidity     \ncharacteristics. Average noninterest-bearing  \ndeposits were $1.8 billion (1.4 percent)      \nhigher than the prior year, driven by the     \nimpact of the MUB acquisition, partially      \noffset by a decrease across all legacy        \nbusiness lines. Provision for Credit Losses   \nThe provision for credit losses was $427      \nmillion in the first quarter of 2023, compared\nwith $112 million in the first quarter of     \n2022. The increase of $315 million was driven \nby the acquisition of MUB, normalizing credit \nlosses and continued economic uncertainty. Net\ncharge-offs increased $211 million in the     \nfirst quarter of 2023, compared with the first\nquarter of 2022, reflecting $91 million of    \ncharge-offs related to the uncollectible      \namount of acquired loans, which were          \nconsidered purchased credit deteriorated as of\nthe date of the MUB acquisition, as well as   \nhigher charge-offs in most loan categories    \nconsistent with normalizing credit conditions.\nRefer to \u201cCorporate Risk Profile\u201d for further \ninformation on the provision for credit       \nlosses, net charge- offs, nonperforming assets\nand other factors considered by the Company in\nassessing the credit quality of the loan      \nportfolio and establishing the allowance for  \ncredit losses.                                \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    5  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                 \n  Table\u00a02    Noninterest Income  \n                                 \n                                              \n             Three                            \n             Mont\u2026                            \n             Ended                            \n  (Do\u2026       March                            \n  in            31                   Per\u2026     \n  Mil\u2026        2023           2022    Cha\u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Card    $    360       $    338     6.5  %  \n  rev\u2026                                        \n  Cor\u2026                                        \n  pay\u2026         189            158    19.6     \n  pro\u2026                                        \n  rev\u2026                                        \n  Mer\u2026                                        \n  pro\u2026         387            363     6.6     \n  ser\u2026                                        \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  and                                         \n  inv\u2026         590            500    18.0     \n  man\u2026                                        \n  fees                                        \n  Ser\u2026         324            333    (2.7  )  \n  cha\u2026                                        \n  Com\u2026                                        \n  pro\u2026         334            266    25.6     \n  rev\u2026                                        \n  Mor\u2026                                        \n  ban\u2026         128            200    (36\u2026  )  \n  rev\u2026                                        \n  Inv\u2026                                        \n  pro\u2026          68             62     9.7     \n  fees                                        \n  Sec\u2026                                        \n  gai\u2026         (32  )          18       *     \n  (lo\u2026                                        \n  net                                         \n  Oth\u2026         159            158      .6     \n  Tot\u2026                                        \n  non\u2026    $  2,507       $  2,396     4.6  %  \n  inc\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                     \n  *  Not meaningful  \n                     \nNoninterest Income Noninterest income was $2.5\nbillion in the first quarter of 2023,         \nrepresenting an increase of $111 million (4.6 \npercent) compared with the first quarter of   \n2022. The increase over the prior year        \nreflected stronger trust and investment       \nmanagement fees, payment services revenue and \ncommercial products revenue, partially offset \nby lower mortgage banking revenue and losses  \non the sale of securities. Trust and          \ninvestment management fees increased $90      \nmillion (18.0 percent) driven by lower money  \nmarket fee waivers and core business growth,  \npartially offset by unfavorable market        \nconditions. Payment services revenue increased\n$77 million (9.0 percent), as card revenue    \nincreased $22 million (6.5 percent) driven by \nhigher sales volume and the acquisition of    \nMUB, corporate payment products revenue       \nincreased $31 million (19.6 percent) due to   \nhigher business spending across all product   \ngroups and merchant processing services       \nrevenue increased $24 million (6.6 percent)   \ndriven by higher sales volume and merchant    \nfees. Commercial products revenue increased   \n$68 million (25.6 percent) driven by higher   \ntrading revenue and the acquisition of MUB.   \nMortgage banking revenue decreased $72 million\n(36.0 percent) reflecting lower application   \nvolume, given declining refinancing activities\nexperienced in the mortgage industry, lower   \nrelated gain on sale margins and fewer sales  \nof performing loans, partially offset by      \nincreases in mortgage servicing rights        \n(\u201cMSRs\u201d) valuations, net of hedging           \nactivities. Noninterest Expense Noninterest   \nexpense was $4.6 billion in the first quarter \n2023, representing an increase of $1.1 billion\n(30.1 percent) over the first quarter of 2022.\nThe increase from the prior year reflected the\nimpact of $244 million of merger and          \nintegration charges, as well as operating     \nexpenses related to the MUB acquisition,      \nhigher compensation and employee benefits     \nexpense, higher other intangibles expense and \nhigher other noninterest expense. Compensation\nand employee benefits expense increased $397  \nmillion (17.7 percent) primarily due to MUB   \nexpense as well as merit increases and hiring \nto support business growth and lower          \ncapitalized loan costs driven by lower        \nmortgage production, partially offset by lower\nperformance-based incentives. Other           \nintangibles expense increased $113 million    \ndriven by the core deposit intangible created \nas a result of the MUB acquisition. Other     \nnoninterest expense increased $103 million    \n(32.0 percent) due to lower prior year        \naccruals related to future delivery exposures \nfor merchant and airline processing and other \nliabilities, higher Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) insurance expense driven \nby an increase in the assessment base and     \nrate, and MUB expense. Although the timing is \nunknown, the Company expects that FDIC        \ninsurance assessments in future periods may be\nelevated due to recent failures by other      \nbanking institutions. Income Tax Expense The  \nprovision for income taxes was $455 million   \n(an effective rate of 21.1 percent) for the   \nfirst quarter of 2023, compared with $397     \nmillion (an effective rate of 20.3 percent)   \nfor the first quarter of 2022.

The decrease was driven by lower    \nother retail loans, credit card loans and     \ncommercial real estate loans, partially offset\nby higher commercial loans and residential    \nmortgages. Other retail loans decreased $2.0  \nbillion (3.6 percent) at March 31, 2023,      \ncompared with December 31, 2022, primarily due\nto decreases in auto loans, retail leasing    \nbalances, revolving credit balances and       \ninstallment loans. Credit card loans decreased\n$806 million (3.1 percent) at March 31, 2023, \ncompared with December 31, 2022, primarily the\nresult of customers seasonally paying down    \nbalances. Commercial real estate loans        \ndecreased $329 million (0.6 percent) at March \n31, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, due\nto payoffs exceeding a reduced level of new   \noriginations. Commercial loans increased $1.6 \nbillion (1.2 percent) at March 31, 2023,      \ncompared with December 31, 2022, due to higher\nutilization driven by working capital needs of\ncorporate customers and slower payoffs given  \nhigher volatility in the capital markets, as  \nwell as core growth. Residential mortgages    \nheld in the loan portfolio increased $1.1     \nbillion (1.0 percent) at March 31, 2023,      \ncompared with December 31, 2022, due to       \nstronger on-balance sheet loan activities and \nslower refinance activity. Residential        \nmortgages originated and placed in the        \nCompany\u2019s loan portfolio include jumbo        \nmortgages and branch-originated first lien    \nhome equity loans to borrowers with high      \ncredit quality. The Company generally retains \nportfolio loans through maturity; however, the\nCompany\u2019s intent may change over time based   \nupon various factors such as ongoing          \nasset/liability management activities,        \nassessment of product profitability, credit   \nrisk, liquidity needs, and capital            \nimplications. If the Company\u2019s intent or      \nability to hold an existing portfolio loan    \nchanges, it is transferred to loans held for  \nsale. Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale,\nconsisting primarily of residential mortgages \nto be sold in the secondary market, were $2.4 \nbillion at March 31, 2023, compared with $2.2 \nbillion at December 31, 2022. The increase in \nloans held for sale was principally due to a  \nhigher level of mortgage loan closings in the \nfirst quarter of 2023, compared with the      \nfourth quarter of 2022. Almost all of the     \nresidential mortgage loans the Company        \noriginates or purchases for sale follow       \nguidelines that allow the loans to be sold    \ninto existing, highly liquid secondary        \nmarkets, in particular in government agency   \ntransactions and to government-sponsored      \nenterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d).                         \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    7  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                    \n  Table\u00a04    Investment Securities  \n                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Information related to asset and       \n       mortgage-backed securities included    \n  (a)  above is presented based upon          \n       weighted-average maturities that take  \n       into account anticipated future        \n       prepayments.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Information related to obligations of  \n       state and political subdivisions is    \n       presented based upon yield to first    \n  (b)  optional call date if the security is  \n       purchased at a premium, and yield to   \n       maturity if the security is purchased  \n       at par or a discount.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Maturity calculations for obligations  \n       of state and political subdivisions    \n       are based on the first optional call   \n  (c)  date for securities with a fair value  \n       above par and the contractual          \n       maturity date for securities with a    \n       fair value equal to or below par.      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Weighted-average yields for            \n       obligations of state and political     \n       subdivisions are presented on a        \n       fully-taxable equivalent basis based   \n       on a federal income tax rate of 21     \n       percent.

The $7.7 billion (4.8 percent) decrease \nwas primarily due to $9.3 billion of net      \ninvestment sales and maturities, partially    \noffset by a $1.3 billion favorable change in  \nnet unrealized gains (losses) on available-   \nfor-sale investment securities. The Company\u2019s \navailable-for-sale investment securities are  \ncarried at fair value with changes in fair    \nvalue reflected in other comprehensive income \n(loss) unless a portion of a security\u2019s       \nunrealized loss is related to credit and an   \nallowance for credit losses is necessary. At  \nMarch 31, 2023, the Company\u2019s net unrealized  \nlosses on available-for-sale investment       \nsecurities were $7.2 billion ($5.4 billion    \nnet-of-tax), compared with $8.5 billion ($6.4 \nbillion net-of-tax) at December 31, 2022. The \nfavorable change in net unrealized gains      \n(losses) was primarily due to increases in the\nfair value of mortgage-backed, U.S. Treasury  \nand state and political securities as a result\nof changes in interest rates. Gross unrealized\nlosses on available-for-sale investment       \nsecurities totaled $7.2 billion at March 31,  \n2023, compared with $8.6 billion at December  \n31, 2022. When evaluating credit losses, the  \nCompany considers various factors such as the \nnature of the investment security, the credit \nratings or financial condition of the issuer, \nthe extent of the unrealized loss, expected   \ncash flows of the underlying collateral, the  \nexistence of any government or agency         \nguarantees, and market conditions. At March   \n31, 2023, the Company had no plans to sell    \nsecurities with unrealized losses, and        \nbelieved it is more likely than not that it   \nwould not be required to sell such securities \nbefore recovery of their amortized cost.

Deposits Total      \ndeposits were $505.3 billion at March 31,     \n2023, compared with $525.0 billion at December\n31, 2022. The first quarter of 2023 banking   \nindustry disruption, beginning on March 8, did\nnot meaningfully impact the Company\u2019s overall \ndeposit balances or composition. The Company\u2019s\ntotal deposits were approximately $508 billion\non March 8, 2023, compared with $505 billion  \non March 31, 2023. The Company maintains a    \ndiverse and stable funding base that includes \na mix of both consumer and operational        \nwholesale deposits. Consumer deposits account \nfor more than 50 percent of total deposits. A \nsignificant portion of the wholesale and trust\ndeposits are collateralized, contractual or   \nrelationship based. At March 31, 2023,        \napproximately 51 percent of deposits were     \ninsured through the FDIC insurance fund and an\nadditional 3 percent of deposits were fully   \ncollateralized. Of the uninsured deposits,    \napproximately 80 percent of these deposits    \nwere retail customers or operational in       \nnature, creating greater stability to these   \ndeposits. In addition, at March 31, 2023 the  \nCompany had total available liquidity         \nrepresenting 126 percent of uninsured         \nbalances. The $19.6 billion (3.7 percent)     \ndecrease in total deposits reflected decreases\nin noninterest-bearing deposits and total     \nsavings deposits, partially offset by an      \nincrease in time deposits. Noninterest-bearing\ndeposits decreased $13.1 billion (9.5 percent)\nat March 31, 2023, compared with December 31, \n2022, primarily due to lower Corporate and    \nCommercial Banking, Wealth Management and     \n                     \n  8    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nInvestment Services, and Consumer and Business\nBanking balances. Savings account balances    \ndecreased $6.8 billion (9.4 percent), driven  \nby lower Consumer and Business Banking        \nbalances. Interest checking balances decreased\n$5.4 billion (4.0 percent), primarily due to  \nlower Wealth Management and Investment        \nServices, Consumer and Business Banking, and  \nCorporate and Commercial Banking balances.    \nMoney market deposit balances increased $1.1  \nbillion (0.7 percent), primarily due to higher\nCorporate and Commercial Banking balances,    \npartially offset by lower Wealth Management   \nand Investment Services balances. Time        \ndeposits increased $4.6 billion (13.9 percent)\nat March 31, 2023, compared with December 31, \n2022, driven by higher Consumer and Business  \nBanking balances, partially offset by lower   \nCorporate and Commercial Banking balances.    \nChanges in time deposits are primarily related\nto those deposits managed as an alternative to\nother funding sources, based largely on       \nrelative pricing and liquidity                \ncharacteristics. Borrowings The Company       \nutilizes both short-term and long-term        \nborrowings as part of its asset/liability     \nmanagement and funding strategies. Short-term \nborrowings, which include federal funds       \npurchased, commercial paper, repurchase       \nagreements, borrowings secured by high-grade  \nassets and other short-term borrowings, were  \n$56.9 billion at March 31, 2023, compared with\n$31.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The $25.7 \nbillion (82.2 percent) increase in short-term \nborrowings was primarily due to increases in  \nshort-term Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d)    \nadvances. Long-term debt was $42.0 billion at \nMarch 31, 2023, compared with $39.8 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022. The $2.2 billion (5.6      \npercent) increase was primarily due to $3.7   \nbillion of medium-term note issuances,        \npartially offset by $1.6 billion of bank note \nrepayments and maturities.

CORPORATE RISK PROFILE Overview      \nManaging risks is an essential part of        \nsuccessfully operating a financial services   \ncompany. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors has \napproved a risk management framework which    \nestablishes governance and risk management    \nrequirements for all risk-taking activities.  \nThis framework includes Company and business  \nline risk appetite statements which set       \nboundaries for the types and amount of risk   \nthat may be undertaken in pursuing business   \nobjectives and initiatives. The Board of      \nDirectors, primarily through its Risk         \nManagement Committee, oversees performance    \nrelative to the risk management framework,    \nrisk appetite statements, and other policy    \nrequirements. The Executive Risk Committee    \n(\u201cERC\u201d), which is chaired by the Chief Risk   \nOfficer and includes the Chief Executive      \nOfficer and other members of the executive    \nmanagement team, oversees execution against   \nthe risk management framework and risk        \nappetite statements. The ERC focuses on       \ncurrent and emerging risks, including         \nstrategic and reputation risks, by directing  \ntimely and comprehensive actions. Senior      \noperating committees have also been           \nestablished, each responsible for overseeing a\nspecified category of risk. Upon closing of   \nthe MUB acquisition, the Company\u2019s risk       \nmanagement framework applies to the legal     \nentities acquired from Mitsubishi UFJ         \nFinancial Group, Inc., including MUB. Prior to\nclosing, the Company evaluated the frameworks,\npolicies and procedures of the acquired       \nentities as necessary. Updates were made to   \nalign the acquired entities with the Company\u2019s\nrisk appetite and connect the elements of     \ntheir respective risk governance and reporting\ninto the Company\u2019s existing risk management   \nframework. Connecting the existing MUB risk   \ngovernance and reporting framework into the   \nCompany\u2019s existing risk management framework  \nallows separate risk profiles, governance, and\nreporting for the Company and the acquired    \nentities, during the period from acquisition  \nthrough bank merger, while also providing the \nability to consolidate reporting for the      \nCompany. Upon completing the merger of MUB    \ninto USBNA, which is expected to occur in     \nconnection with the conversion of MUB         \ncustomers and systems to the USBNA platform   \nover Memorial Day weekend in 2023, the MUB    \nrisk governance and reporting framework will  \nno longer be applicable. The Company\u2019s most   \nprominent risk exposures are credit, interest \nrate, market, liquidity, operational,         \ncompliance, strategic, and reputation. Credit \nrisk is the risk of loss associated with a    \nchange in the credit profile or the failure of\na borrower or counterparty to meet its        \ncontractual obligations. Interest rate risk is\nthe current or prospective risk to earnings   \nand capital, or market valuations, arising    \nfrom the impact of changes in interest rates. \nMarket risk arises from fluctuations in       \ninterest rates, foreign exchange rates, and   \nsecurity prices that may result in changes in \nthe values of financial instruments, such as  \ntrading and available-for-sale securities,    \nmortgage loans held for sale (\u201cMLHFS\u201d), MSRs  \nand derivatives that are accounted for on a   \nfair value basis. Liquidity risk is the risk  \nthat financial condition or overall safety and\nsoundness is adversely affected by the        \nCompany\u2019s inability, or perceived inability,  \nto meet its cash flow obligations in a timely \nand                                           \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    9  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \ncomplete manner in either normal or stressed  \nconditions. Operational risk is the risk to   \ncurrent or projected financial condition and  \nresilience arising from inadequate or failed  \ninternal processes or systems, people         \n(including human errors or misconduct), or    \nadverse external events, including the risk of\nloss resulting from breaches in data security.\nOperational risk can also include the risk of \nloss due to failures by third parties with    \nwhich the Company does business. Compliance   \nrisk is the risk that the Company may suffer  \nlegal or regulatory sanctions, financial      \nlosses, and reputational damage if it fails to\nadhere to compliance requirements and the     \nCompany\u2019s compliance policies. Strategic risk \nis the risk to current or projected financial \ncondition and resilience arising from adverse \nbusiness decisions, poor implementation of    \nbusiness decisions, or lack of responsiveness \nto changes in the banking industry and        \noperating environment. Reputation risk is the \nrisk to current or anticipated earnings,      \ncapital, or franchise or enterprise value     \narising from negative public opinion. This    \nrisk may impair the Company\u2019s competitiveness \nby affecting its ability to establish new     \nrelationships or services, or continue serving\nexisting relationships. In addition to the    \nrisks identified above, other risk factors    \nexist that may impact the Company. Refer to   \n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report \non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,  \n2022, for a detailed discussion of these      \nfactors. The Company\u2019s Board and management-  \nlevel governance committees are supported by a\n\u201cthree lines of defense\u201d model for            \nestablishing effective checks and balances.   \nThe first line of defense, the business lines,\nmanages risks in conformity with established  \nlimits and policy requirements. In turn,      \nbusiness line leaders and their risk officers \nestablish programs to ensure conformity with  \nthese limits and policy requirements. The     \nsecond line of defense, which includes the    \nChief Risk Officer\u2019s organization as well as  \npolicy and oversight activities of corporate  \nsupport functions, translates risk appetite   \nand strategy into actionable risk limits and  \npolicies. The second line of defense monitors \nfirst line of defense conformity with limits  \nand policies, and provides reporting and      \nescalation of emerging risks and other        \nconcerns to senior management and the Risk    \nManagement Committee of the Board of          \nDirectors. The third line of defense, internal\naudit, is responsible for providing the Audit \nCommittee of the Board of Directors and senior\nmanagement with independent assessment and    \nassurance regarding the effectiveness of the  \nCompany\u2019s governance, risk management and     \ncontrol processes. Management regularly       \nprovides reports to the Risk Management       \nCommittee of the Board of Directors. The Risk \nManagement Committee discusses with management\nthe Company\u2019s risk management performance, and\nprovides a summary of key risks to the entire \nBoard of Directors, covering the status of    \nexisting matters, areas of potential future   \nconcern and specific information on certain   \ntypes of loss events. The Risk Management     \nCommittee considers quarterly reports by      \nmanagement assessing the Company\u2019s performance\nrelative to the risk appetite statements and  \nthe associated risk limits, including:        \n                                              \n       Macroeconomic environment and other    \n       qualitative considerations, such as    \n  \u2022    regulatory and compliance changes,     \n       litigation developments, geopolitical  \n       events, and technology and             \n       cybersecurity;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit measures, including adversely   \n  \u2022    rated and nonperforming loans,         \n       leveraged transactions, credit         \n       concentrations and lending limits;     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Interest rate and market risk,         \n  \u2022    including market value and net income  \n       simulation, and trading-related Value  \n       at Risk (\u201cVaR\u201d);                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Liquidity risk, including funding      \n  \u2022    projections under various stressed     \n       scenarios;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       Operational and compliance risk,       \n       including losses stemming from events  \n       such as fraud, processing errors,      \n       control breaches, breaches in data     \n  \u2022    security or adverse business           \n       decisions, as well as reporting on     \n       technology performance, and various    \n       legal and regulatory compliance        \n       measures;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Capital ratios and projections,        \n  \u2022    including regulatory measures and      \n       stressed scenarios; and                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Strategic and reputation risk          \n  \u2022    considerations, impacts and            \n       responses.                             \n                                              \nCredit Risk Management The Company\u2019s strategy \nfor credit risk management includes well-     \ndefined, centralized credit policies, uniform \nunderwriting criteria, and ongoing risk       \nmonitoring and review processes for all       \ncommercial and consumer credit exposures. The \nstrategy also emphasizes diversification on a \ngeographic, industry and customer level,      \nregular credit examinations and management    \nreviews of loans exhibiting deterioration of  \ncredit quality. In evaluating its credit risk,\nthe Company considers changes, if any, in     \nunderwriting activities, the loan portfolio   \ncomposition (including product mix and        \ngeographic, industry or customer-specific     \nconcentrations), collateral values, trends in \nloan performance and macroeconomic factors,   \nsuch as changes in unemployment rates, gross  \ndomestic product levels, inflation, interest  \nrates and consumer bankruptcy filings. The    \nRisk Management Committee oversees the        \nCompany\u2019s credit risk management process. In  \naddition, credit quality ratings, as defined  \nby the Company, are an important part of the  \nCompany\u2019s overall credit risk management and  \nevaluation of its                             \n                      \n  10    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nallowance for credit losses. Loans with a pass\nrating represent those loans not classified on\nthe Company\u2019s rating scale for problem        \ncredits, as minimal credit risk has been      \nidentified. Loans with a special mention or   \nclassified rating, including consumer lending \nand small business loans that are 90 days or  \nmore past due and still accruing, nonaccrual  \nloans and loans in a junior lien position that\nare current but are behind a first lien       \nposition on nonaccrual, encompass all loans   \nheld by the Company that it considers to have \na potential or well-defined weakness that may \nput full collection of contractual cash flows \nat risk. The Company\u2019s internal credit quality\nratings for consumer loans are primarily based\non delinquency and nonperforming status,      \nexcept for a limited population of larger     \nloans within those portfolios that are        \nindividually evaluated. For this limited      \npopulation, the determination of the internal \ncredit quality rating may also consider       \ncollateral value and customer cash flows.     \nRefer to Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated  \nFinancial Statements for further discussion of\nthe Company\u2019s loan portfolios including       \ninternal credit quality ratings. In addition, \nrefer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u2014 Credit Risk Management\u201d in the Company\u2019s    \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022, for a more detailed        \ndiscussion on credit risk management          \nprocesses. The Company manages its credit     \nrisk, in part, through diversification of its \nloan portfolio which is achieved through limit\nsetting by product type criteria, such as     \nindustry, and identification of credit        \nconcentrations. The Company categorizes its   \nloan portfolio into two segments, which is the\nlevel at which it develops and documents a    \nsystematic methodology to determine the       \nallowance for credit losses. The Company\u2019s two\nloan portfolio segments are commercial lending\nand consumer lending. The commercial lending  \nsegment includes loans and leases made to     \nsmall business, middle market, large          \ncorporate, commercial real estate, financial  \ninstitution, non-profit and public sector     \ncustomers. Key risk characteristics relevant  \nto commercial lending segment loans include   \nthe industry and geography of the borrower\u2019s  \nbusiness, purpose of the loan, repayment      \nsource, borrower\u2019s debt capacity and financial\nflexibility, loan covenants, and nature of    \npledged collateral, if any, as well as        \nmacroeconomic factors such as unemployment    \nrates, gross domestic product levels,         \ncorporate bond spreads and long-term interest \nrates. These risk characteristics, among      \nothers, are considered in determining         \nestimates about the likelihood of default by  \nthe borrowers and the severity of loss in the \nevent of default. The Company considers these \nrisk characteristics in assigning internal    \nrisk ratings to, or forecasting losses on,    \nthese loans, which are the significant factors\nin determining the allowance for credit losses\nfor loans in the commercial lending segment.  \nThe consumer lending segment represents loans \nand leases made to consumer customers,        \nincluding residential mortgages, credit card  \nloans, and other retail loans such as         \nrevolving consumer lines, auto loans and      \nleases, home equity loans and lines, and      \nstudent loans, a run-off portfolio. Home      \nequity or second mortgage loans are junior    \nlien closed-end accounts fully disbursed at   \norigination. These loans typically are fixed  \nrate loans, secured by residential real       \nestate, with a 10- or 15-year fixed payment   \namortization schedule. Home equity lines are  \nrevolving accounts giving the borrower the    \nability to draw and repay balances repeatedly,\nup to a maximum commitment, and are secured by\nresidential real estate. These include        \naccounts in either a first or junior lien     \nposition. Typical terms on home equity lines  \nin the portfolio are variable rates           \nbenchmarked to the prime rate, with a 10-year \ndraw period during which a minimum payment is \nequivalent to the monthly interest, followed  \nby a 20-year amortization period,             \nrespectively. At March 31, 2023, substantially\nall of the Company\u2019s home equity lines were in\nthe draw period. Key risk characteristics     \nrelevant to consumer lending segment loans    \nprimarily relate to the borrowers\u2019 capacity   \nand willingness to repay and include          \nunemployment rates, consumer bankruptcy       \nfilings and other macroeconomic factors,      \ncustomer payment history and credit scores,   \nand in some cases, updated loan-to-value      \n(\u201cLTV\u201d) information reflecting current market \nconditions on real estate-based loans. These  \nand other risk characteristics are reflected  \nin forecasts of delinquency levels,           \nbankruptcies and losses which are the primary \nfactors in determining the allowance for      \ncredit losses for the consumer lending        \nsegment. The Company further disaggregates its\nloan portfolio segments into various classes  \nbased on their underlying risk                \ncharacteristics. The two classes within the   \ncommercial lending segment are commercial     \nloans and commercial real estate loans. The   \nthree classes within the consumer lending     \nsegment are residential mortgages, credit card\nloans and other retail loans. The Company\u2019s   \nconsumer lending segment utilizes several     \ndistinct business processes and channels to   \noriginate consumer credit, including          \ntraditional branch lending, mobile and on-line\nbanking, indirect lending, alliance           \npartnerships and correspondent banks. Each    \ndistinct underwriting and origination activity\nmanages unique credit risk characteristics and\nprices its loan production commensurate with  \nthe differing risk profiles.                  \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    11  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nResidential mortgage originations are         \ngenerally limited to prime borrowers and are  \nperformed through the Company\u2019s branches, loan\nproduction offices, mobile and on-line        \nservices, and a wholesale network of          \noriginators. The Company may retain           \nresidential mortgage loans it originates on   \nits balance sheet or sell the loans into the  \nsecondary market while retaining the servicing\nrights and customer relationships. Utilizing  \nthe secondary markets enables the Company to  \neffectively reduce its credit and other       \nasset/liability risks. For residential        \nmortgages that are retained in the Company\u2019s  \nportfolio and for home equity and second      \nmortgages, credit risk is managed by adherence\nto LTV and borrower credit criteria during the\nunderwriting process. The Company estimates   \nupdated LTV information on its outstanding    \nresidential mortgages quarterly, based on a   \nmethod that combines automated valuation model\nupdates and relevant home price indices. LTV  \nis the ratio of the loan\u2019s outstanding        \nprincipal balance to the current estimate of  \nproperty value. For home equity and second    \nmortgages, combined loan-to-value (\u201cCLTV\u201d) is \nthe combination of the first mortgage original\nprincipal balance and the second lien         \noutstanding principal balance, relative to the\ncurrent estimate of property value. Certain   \nloans do not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily   \ndue to lack of availability of relevant       \nautomated valuation model and/or home price   \nindices values, or lack of necessary valuation\ndata on acquired loans.

Accruing loans  \n90 days or more past due are not included in  \nnonperforming assets and continue to accrue   \ninterest because they are adequately secured  \nby collateral, are in the process of          \ncollection and are reasonably expected to     \nresult in repayment or restoration to current \nstatus, or are managed in homogeneous         \nportfolios with specified charge-off          \ntimeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines. \nThe ratio of accruing loans 90 days or more   \npast due to total loans was 0.13 percent at   \nMarch 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.         \n                                              \n  Table\u00a05    Delinquent Loan Ratios as a      \n             Percent of Ending Loan Balances  \n                                              \n                                              \n  90 days                        December     \n  or more      March\u00a031,              31,     \n  past due          2023             2022     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Commerci\u2026                                   \n  Commerci\u2026          .05  %           .07  %  \n  Lease                \u2014                \u2014     \n  financing                                   \n  Total              .05              .07     \n  commerci\u2026                                   \n  Commerci\u2026                                   \n  Real                                        \n  Estate                                      \n  Commerci\u2026          .01                \u2014     \n  mortgages                                   \n  Construc\u2026                                   \n  and                .01              .03     \n  developm\u2026                                   \n  Total                                       \n  commerci\u2026          .01              .01     \n  real                                        \n  estate                                      \n  Resident\u2026                                   \n  Mortgages          .08              .08     \n  (a)                                         \n  Credit            1.00              .88     \n  Card                                        \n  Other                                       \n  Retail                                      \n  Retail             .04              .04     \n  leasing                                     \n  Home                                        \n  equity                                      \n  and                .29              .28     \n  second                                      \n  mortgages                                   \n  Other              .07              .08     \n  Total                                       \n  other              .12              .12     \n  retail                                      \n  Total              .13  %           .13  %  \n  loans                                       \n  90 days                                     \n  or more                        December     \n  past due     March\u00a031,              31,     \n  and               2023             2022     \n  nonperfo\u2026                                   \n  loans                                       \n  Commerci\u2026          .18  %           .19  %  \n  Commerci\u2026                                   \n  real               .98              .62     \n  estate                                      \n  Resident\u2026                                   \n  mortgages          .33              .36     \n  (a)                                         \n  Credit            1.01              .88     \n  card                                        \n  Other              .37              .37     \n  retail                                      \n  Total              .42  %           .38  %  \n  loans                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Delinquent loan ratios exclude $2.2    \n       billion at March\u00a031, 2023, and at      \n       December\u00a031, 2022, of loans purchased  \n       and loans that could be purchased      \n       from GNMA mortgage pools under         \n       delinquent loan repurchase options     \n       whose repayments are primarily         \n       insured by the Federal Housing         \n  (a)  Administration or guaranteed by the    \n       United States Department of Veterans   \n       Affairs.

certain circumstances, the  \nCompany may modify the terms of a loan to     \nmaximize the collection of amounts due when a \nborrower is experiencing financial            \ndifficulties or is expected to experience     \ndifficulties in the near-term. In most cases  \nthe modification is either a concessionary    \nreduction in interest rate, extension of the  \nmaturity date or reduction in the principal   \nbalance that would otherwise not be           \nconsidered. Modified loans accrue interest if \nthe borrower complies with the revised terms  \nand conditions and has demonstrated repayment \nperformance at a level commensurate with the  \nmodified terms over several payment cycles,   \nwhich is generally six months or greater. The \nCompany continues to work with customers to   \nmodify loans for borrowers who are            \nexperiencing financial difficulties. Many of  \nthe Company\u2019s loan modifications are          \ndetermined on a case-by-case basis in         \nconnection with ongoing loan collection       \nprocesses. The modifications vary within each \nof the Company\u2019s loan classes. Commercial     \nlending segment modifications generally       \ninclude extensions of the maturity date and   \nmay be accompanied by an increase or decrease \nto the interest rate. The Company may also    \nwork with the borrower to make other changes  \nto the loan to mitigate losses, such as       \nobtaining additional collateral and/or        \nguarantees to support the loan. The Company   \nhas also implemented certain residential      \nmortgage loan modification programs. The      \nCompany modifies residential mortgage loans   \nunder Federal Housing Administration, United  \nStates Department of Veterans Affairs, and its\nown internal programs. Under these programs,  \nthe Company offers qualifying homeowners the  \nopportunity to permanently modify their loan  \nand achieve more affordable monthly payments. \nThese modifications may include adjustments to\ninterest rates, conversion of adjustable rates\nto fixed rates, extensions of maturity dates  \nor deferrals of payments, capitalization of   \naccrued interest and/or outstanding advances, \nor in limited situations, partial forgiveness \nof loan principal. In most instances,         \nparticipation in residential mortgage loan    \nmodification programs requires the customer to\ncomplete a short-term trial period. A         \npermanent loan modification is contingent on  \nthe customer successfully completing the trial\nperiod arrangement, and the loan documents are\nnot modified until that time. Credit card and \nother retail loan modifications are generally \npart of distinct modification programs        \nproviding customers modification solutions    \nover a                                        \n                      \n  14    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nspecified time period, generally up to 60     \nmonths. The Company also makes short-term     \nmodifications, in limited circumstances, to   \nassist borrowers experiencing temporary       \nhardships, including previously offering      \npayment relief to borrowers that experienced  \nfinancial hardship resulting directly from the\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Short-term  \nconsumer lending modification programs include\npayment reductions, deferrals of up to three  \npast due payments, and the ability to return  \nto current status if the borrower makes       \nrequired payments. The Company may also make  \nshort-term modifications to commercial lending\nloans, with the most common modification being\nan extension of the maturity date of three    \nmonths or less. Such extensions generally are \nused when the maturity date is imminent and   \nthe borrower is experiencing some level of    \nfinancial stress, but the Company believes the\nborrower will pay all contractual amounts     \nowed. Nonperforming Assets The level of       \nnonperforming assets represents another       \nindicator of the potential for future credit  \nlosses. Nonperforming assets include          \nnonaccrual loans, modified loans not          \nperforming in accordance with modified terms  \nand not accruing interest, modified loans that\nhave not met the performance period required  \nto return to accrual status, other real estate\nowned (\u201cOREO\u201d) and other nonperforming assets \nowned by the Company. Interest payments       \ncollected from assets on nonaccrual status are\ngenerally applied against the principal       \nbalance and not recorded as income. However,  \ninterest income may be recognized for interest\npayments if the remaining carrying amount of  \nthe loan is believed to be collectible. At    \nMarch 31, 2023, total nonperforming assets    \nwere $1.2 billion, compared to $1.0 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022. The $165 million (16.2     \npercent) increase in nonperforming assets was \nprimarily due to higher nonperforming         \ncommercial real estate loans resulting from an\ninternal review of the acquired MUB loan      \nportfolio, completed once closing was achieved\nand access to loan documents and customer     \nfiles was available. The ratio of total       \nnonperforming assets to total loans and other \nreal estate was 0.30 percent at March 31,     \n2023, compared with 0.26 percent at December  \n31, 2022. OREO was $23 million at March 31,   \n2023 and December 31, 2022, and was related to\nforeclosed properties that previously secured \nloan balances. These balances exclude         \nforeclosed GNMA loans whose repayments are    \nprimarily insured by the Federal Housing      \nAdministration or guaranteed by the United    \nStates Department of Veterans Affairs.        \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    15  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n

The    \n$211 million increase reflected $91 million of\ncharge-offs related to the uncollectible      \namount of acquired loans, which were          \nconsidered purchased credit deteriorated as of\nthe date of the MUB acquisition, as well as   \nhigher charge-offs in most loan categories    \nconsistent with normalizing credit conditions.\nThe ratio of total loan net charge-offs to    \naverage loans outstanding on an annualized    \nbasis for the first quarter of 2023 was 0.39  \npercent (0.30 percent excluding the impact of \nthe MUB acquisition-related charge-offs),     \ncompared with 0.21 percent for the first      \nquarter of 2022. Analysis and Determination of\nthe Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance \nfor credit losses is established for current  \nexpected credit losses on the Company\u2019s loan  \nand lease portfolio, including unfunded credit\ncommitments. The allowance considers expected \nlosses for the remaining lives of the         \napplicable assets, inclusive of expected      \nrecoveries. The allowance for credit losses is\nincreased through provisions charged to       \nearnings and reduced by net charge-offs.      \nManagement evaluates the appropriateness of   \nthe allowance for credit losses on a quarterly\nbasis. Multiple economic scenarios are        \nconsidered over a three-year reasonable and   \nsupportable forecast period, which includes   \nincreasing consideration of historical loss   \nexperience over years two and three. These    \neconomic scenarios are constructed with       \ninterrelated projections of multiple economic \nvariables, and loss estimates are produced    \nthat consider the historical correlation of   \nthose economic variables with credit losses.  \nAfter the forecast period, the Company fully  \nreverts to long-term historical loss          \nexperience, adjusted for prepayments and      \ncharacteristics of the current loan and lease \nportfolio, to estimate losses over the        \nremaining life of the portfolio. The economic \nscenarios are updated at least quarterly and  \nare designed to provide a range of reasonable \nestimates from better to worse than current   \nexpectations. Scenarios are weighted based on \nthe Company\u2019s expectation of economic         \nconditions for the foreseeable future and     \nreflect significant judgment and consideration\nof economic forecast uncertainty. Final loss  \nestimates also consider factors affecting     \ncredit losses not reflected in the scenarios, \ndue to the unique aspects of current          \nconditions and expectations. These factors may\ninclude, but are not limited to, loan         \nservicing practices, regulatory guidance,     \nand/or fiscal and monetary policy actions.    \nBecause business processes and credit risks   \nassociated with unfunded credit commitments   \nare essentially the same as for loans, the    \nCompany utilizes similar processes to estimate\nits liability for unfunded credit commitments,\nwhich is included in other liabilities in the \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Both the allowance\nfor loan losses and the liability for unfunded\ncredit commitments are included in the        \nCompany\u2019s analysis of credit losses and       \nreported reserve ratios. The allowance        \nrecorded for credit losses utilizes forward-  \nlooking expected loss models to consider a    \nvariety of factors affecting lifetime credit  \nlosses. These factors include, but are not    \nlimited to, macroeconomic variables such as   \nunemployment rates, real estate prices, gross \ndomestic product levels, inflation, interest  \nrates, and corporate bond spreads, as well as \nloan and borrower characteristics, such as    \ninternal risk ratings on commercial loans and \nconsumer credit scores,                       \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    17  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \ndelinquency status, collateral type and       \navailable valuation information, consideration\nof end-of-term losses on lease residuals, and \nthe remaining term of the loan, adjusted for  \nexpected prepayments. For each loan portfolio,\nincluding those loans modified under various  \nloan modification programs, model estimates   \nare adjusted as necessary to consider any     \nrelevant changes in portfolio composition,    \nlending policies, underwriting standards, risk\nmanagement practices, economic conditions or  \nother factors that may affect the accuracy of \nthe model. Expected credit loss estimates also\ninclude consideration of expected cash        \nrecoveries on loans previously charged-off or \nexpected recoveries on collateral-dependent   \nloans where recovery is expected through sale \nof the collateral at fair value less selling  \ncosts. Where loans do not exhibit similar risk\ncharacteristics, an individual analysis is    \nperformed to consider expected credit losses. \nThe allowance recorded for individually       \nevaluated loans greater than $5 million in the\ncommercial lending segment is based on an     \nanalysis utilizing expected cash flows        \ndiscounted using the original effective       \ninterest rate, the observable market price of \nthe loan, or the fair value of the collateral,\nless selling costs, for collateral-dependent  \nloans as appropriate. When evaluating the     \nappropriateness of the allowance for credit   \nlosses for any loans and lines in a junior    \nlien position, the Company considers the      \ndelinquency and modification status of the    \nfirst lien. At March 31, 2023, the Company    \nserviced the first lien on 33 percent of the  \nhome equity loans and lines in a junior lien  \nposition. The Company also considers the      \nstatus of first lien mortgage accounts        \nreported on customer credit bureau files when \nthe first lien is not serviced by the Company.\nRegardless of whether the Company services the\nfirst lien, an assessment is made of economic \nconditions, problem loans, recent loss        \nexperience and other factors in determining   \nthe allowance for credit losses. Based on the \navailable information, the Company estimated  \n$178 million or 1.4 percent of its total home \nequity portfolio at March 31, 2023,           \nrepresented non-delinquent junior liens where \nthe first lien was delinquent or modified.    \nWhen a loan portfolio is purchased, the       \nacquired loans are divided into those         \nconsidered purchased with more than           \ninsignificant credit deterioration (\u201cPCD\u201d) and\nthose not considered PCD. An allowance is     \nestablished for each population and considers \nproduct mix, risk characteristics of the      \nportfolio and delinquency status and refreshed\nLTV ratios when possible. PCD loans also      \nconsider whether the loan has experienced a   \ncharge-off, bankruptcy or significant         \ndeterioration since origination. The allowance\nestablished for purchased loans not considered\nPCD is recognized through provision expense   \nupon acquisition, whereas the allowance       \nestablished for loans considered PCD at       \nacquisition is offset by an increase in the   \nbasis of the acquired loans. Any subsequent   \nincreases and decreases in the allowance      \nrelated to purchased loans, regardless of PCD \nstatus, are recognized through provision      \nexpense, with charge-offs charged to the      \nallowance. The Company had a total unpaid     \nprincipal balance of $4.8 billion of PCD      \nloans, primarily related to the MUB           \nacquisition, included in its loan portfolio at\nMarch 31, 2023. The Company\u2019s methodology for \ndetermining the appropriate allowance for     \ncredit losses also considers the imprecision  \ninherent in the methodologies used and        \nallocated to the various loan portfolios. As a\nresult, amounts determined under the          \nmethodologies described above are adjusted by \nmanagement to consider the potential impact of\nother qualitative factors not captured in     \nquantitative model adjustments which include, \nbut are not limited to, the following: model  \nimprecision, imprecision in economic scenario \nassumptions, and emerging risks related to    \neither changes in the economic environment    \nthat are affecting specific portfolios, or    \nchanges in portfolio concentrations over time \nthat may affect model performance. The        \nconsideration of these items results in       \nadjustments to allowance amounts included in  \nthe Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses for \neach loan portfolio. Although the Company     \ndetermined the amount of each element of the  \nallowance separately and considers this       \nprocess to be an important credit management  \ntool, the entire allowance for credit losses  \nis available for the entire loan portfolio.   \nThe actual amount of losses can vary          \nsignificantly from the estimated amounts. At  \nMarch 31, 2023, the allowance for credit      \nlosses was $7.5 billion (1.94 percent of      \nperiod-end loans), compared with an allowance \nof $7.4 billion (1.91 percent of period-end   \nloans) at December 31, 2022. The allowance for\ncredit losses at March 31, 2023 included a $62\nmillion decrease due to a change in accounting\nprinciple related to discontinuing the        \nseparate recognition and measurement of       \ntroubled debt restructurings. The increase in \nthe allowance for credit losses at March 31,  \n2023, compared with December 31, 2022, was    \nprimarily driven by increasing economic       \nuncertainty and normalizing credit losses as  \nwell as adjustments made to the purchase      \naccounting estimate for PCD loans. Economic   \nuncertainty and recession risk have been      \nincreasing due to rising interest rates,      \ninflationary concerns, market volatility and  \npressure on corporate earnings related to     \nthese factors. In addition to these broad     \neconomic factors, expected loss estimates     \nconsider various factors including customer   \nspecific information                          \n                      \n  18    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nimpacting changes in risk ratings, projected  \ndelinquencies and the impact of economic      \ndeterioration on selected borrowers\u2019 liquidity\nand ability to repay. The ratio of the        \nallowance for credit losses to nonperforming  \nloans was 660 percent at March 31, 2023,      \ncompared with 762 percent at December 31,     \n2022. The ratio of the allowance for credit   \nlosses to annualized loan net charge-offs was \n497 percent at March 31, 2023, compared with  \n697 percent of full year 2022 net charge- offs\nat December 31, 2022. Economic conditions     \nconsidered in estimating the allowance for    \ncredit losses at March 31, 2023 included      \nchanges in projected gross domestic product   \nand unemployment levels. These factors are    \nevaluated through a combination of            \nquantitative calculations using multiple      \neconomic scenarios and additional qualitative \nassessments that consider the high degree of  \neconomic uncertainty in the current           \nenvironment. The projected unemployment rates \nfor 2023 considered in the estimate range from\n3.0 percent to 7.5 percent.

  \nvalue of leased vehicles, office and business \nequipment, and other assets through           \ndisciplined residual valuation at the         \ninception of a lease, diversification of its  \nleased assets, regular residual asset         \nvaluation reviews and monitoring of residual  \nvalue gains or losses upon the disposition of \nassets. As of March 31, 2023, no significant  \nchange in the amount of residual values or    \nconcentration of the portfolios had occurred  \nsince December 31, 2022.

Operational risk is   \ninherent in all business activities, and the  \nmanagement of this risk is important to the   \nachievement of the Company\u2019s objectives.      \nBusiness lines have direct and primary        \nresponsibility and accountability for         \nidentifying, controlling, and monitoring      \noperational risks embedded in their business  \nactivities, including those additional or     \nincreased risks created by economic and       \nfinancial disruptions. The Company maintains a\nsystem of controls with the objective of      \nproviding proper transaction authorization and\nexecution, proper system operations, proper   \noversight of third parties with whom it does  \nbusiness, safeguarding of assets from misuse  \nor theft, and ensuring the reliability and    \nsecurity of financial and other data.

Compliance Risk  \nManagement The Company may suffer legal or    \nregulatory sanctions, material financial loss,\nor damage to its reputation through failure to\ncomply with laws, regulations, rules,         \nstandards of good practice, and codes of      \nconduct, including those related to compliance\nwith Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering   \nrequirements, sanctions compliance            \nrequirements as administered by the Office of \nForeign Assets Control, consumer protection   \nand other requirements. The Company has       \ncontrols and processes in place for the       \nassessment, identification, monitoring,       \nmanagement and reporting of compliance risks  \nand issues, including those created or        \nincreased by economic and financial           \ndisruptions. Refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion\nand Analysis \u2014 Compliance Risk Management\u201d in \nthe Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for  \nthe year ended December 31, 2022, for further \ndiscussion on compliance risk management.     \nInterest Rate Risk Management In the banking  \nindustry, changes in interest rates are a     \nsignificant risk that can impact earnings and \nthe safety and soundness of an entity. The    \nCompany manages its exposure to changes in    \ninterest rates through asset and liability    \nmanagement activities within guidelines       \nestablished by its Asset Liability Management \nCommittee (\u201cALCO\u201d) and approved by the Board  \nof Directors. The ALCO has the responsibility \nfor approving and overseeing compliance with  \nthe ALCO management policies, including       \ninterest rate risk exposure. One way the      \nCompany measures and analyzes its interest    \nrate risk is through net interest income      \nsimulation analysis. Simulation analysis      \nincorporates substantially all of the         \nCompany\u2019s assets and liabilities and off-     \nbalance sheet instruments, together with      \nforecasted changes in the balance sheet and   \nassumptions that reflect the current interest \nrate environment. Through this simulation,    \nmanagement estimates the impact on net        \ninterest income of various interest rate      \nchanges that differ in the direction, amount  \nand speed of change over time, as well as the \nshape of the yield curve. This simulation     \nincludes assumptions about how the balance    \nsheet is likely to be affected by changes in  \nloan and deposit growth. Assumptions are made \nto project interest rates for new loans and   \ndeposits based on historical analysis,        \nmanagement\u2019s outlook and re-pricing           \nstrategies. These assumptions are reviewed and\nvalidated on a periodic basis with sensitivity\nanalysis being provided for key variables of  \nthe simulation. The results are reviewed      \nmonthly by the ALCO and are used to guide     \nasset/liability management strategies. The    \nCompany manages its interest rate risk        \nposition by holding assets with desired       \ninterest rate risk characteristics on its     \nbalance sheet, implementing certain pricing   \nstrategies for loans and deposits and         \nselecting derivatives and various funding and \ninvestment portfolio strategies. The Company  \nalso manages interest rate sensitivity by     \nutilizing market value of equity modeling,    \nwhich measures the degree to which the market \nvalues of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities\nand off-balance sheet instruments will change \ngiven a change in interest rates. Management  \nmeasures the impact of changes in market      \nvalues due to interest rates under a number of\nscenarios, including immediate and sustained  \nparallel shifts, and flattening or steepening \nof the yield curve. The Company continues to  \nactively monitor markets and proactively      \nmanage its balance sheet and heightened its   \nfocus on its interest rate risk management    \ngovernance process during the first quarter of\n2023 banking industry disruption. Over the    \nlast five quarters, in advance of the recent  \nindustry disruption and in connection with the\npreparation and completion of the MUB         \nacquisition, the Company reduced its          \ninvestment securities portfolio from          \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    21  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table\u00a09    Sensitivity of Net Interest      \n             Income                           \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n30 percent to 25 percent of total assets, sold\nfixed rate loans, reduced outstanding         \nborrowings, increased cash balances and       \nentered into additional fair value hedges on  \navailable-for-sale investment securities in   \nresponse to economic uncertainty, industry    \ndynamics, rising interest rates and increased \nmarket volatility. Table 9 summarizes the     \nprojected impact to net interest income over  \nthe next 12 months of various potential       \ninterest rate changes. The sensitivity of the \nprojected impact to net interest income over  \nthe next 12 months is dependent on balance    \nsheet growth, product mix, deposit behavior,  \npricing and funding decisions. While the      \nCompany utilizes models and assumptions based \non historical information and expected        \nbehaviors, actual outcomes could vary         \nsignificantly. Net interest income            \nsensitivities reflect the impact of current   \nmarket expectations for interest rates,       \ndriving an increase in baseline projected net \ninterest income. As market expectations are   \nreflected in projected results, incremental   \ninterest rate sensitivity declines on a       \npercentage basis. Use of Derivatives to Manage\nInterest Rate and Other Risks To manage the   \nsensitivity of earnings and capital to        \ninterest rate, prepayment, credit, price and  \nforeign currency fluctuations (asset and      \nliability management positions), the Company  \nenters into derivative transactions. The      \nCompany uses derivatives for asset and        \nliability management purposes primarily in the\nfollowing ways:                               \n                                              \n       To convert fixed-rate debt and         \n  \u2022    available-for-sale investment          \n       securities from fixed-rate payments    \n       to floating-rate payments;             \n                                              \n                                              \n       To convert floating-rate loans and     \n  \u2022    debt from floating-rate payments to    \n       fixed-rate payments;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate changes in value of the    \n  \u2022    Company\u2019s unfunded mortgage loan       \n       commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs;    \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate remeasurement volatility   \n  \u2022    of foreign currency denominated        \n       balances; and                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate the volatility of the      \n  \u2022    Company\u2019s net investment in foreign    \n       operations driven by fluctuations in   \n       foreign currency exchange rates.       \n                                              \nIn addition, the Company enters into interest \nrate and foreign exchange derivative contracts\nto support the business requirements of its   \ncustomers (customer-related positions). The   \nCompany minimizes the market and liquidity    \nrisks of customer-related positions by either \nentering into similar offsetting positions    \nwith broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis  \nby entering into other derivative or non-     \nderivative financial instruments that         \npartially or fully offset the exposure from   \nthese customer-related positions. The Company \nmay enter into derivative contracts that are  \neither exchange-traded, centrally cleared     \nthrough clearinghouses or over-the-counter.   \nThe Company does not utilize derivatives for  \nspeculative purposes. The Company does not    \ndesignate all of the derivatives that it      \nenters into for risk management purposes as   \naccounting hedges because of the inefficiency \nof applying the accounting requirements and   \nmay instead elect fair value accounting for   \nthe related hedged items. In particular, the  \nCompany enters into interest rate swaps,      \nswaptions, forward commitments to buy to-be-  \nannounced securities (\u201cTBAs\u201d), U.S. Treasury  \nand Eurodollar futures and options on U.S.    \nTreasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in  \nthe value of its MSRs, but does not designate \nthose derivatives as accounting hedges.       \nAdditionally, the Company uses forward        \ncommitments to sell TBAs and other commitments\nto sell residential mortgage loans at         \nspecified prices to economically hedge the    \ninterest rate risk in its residential mortgage\nloan production activities. The forward       \ncommitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage \nloan commitments on loans intended to be sold \nare considered derivatives under the          \naccounting guidance related to accounting for \nderivative instruments and hedging activities.\nThe Company has elected the fair value option \nfor the MLHFS. Derivatives are subject to     \ncredit risk associated with counterparties to \nthe contracts. Credit risk associated with    \nderivatives is measured by the Company based  \non the probability of counterparty default.   \nThe Company manages the credit risk of its    \nderivative positions by diversifying its      \npositions among various counterparties, by    \nentering into master netting arrangements,    \nand, where possible, by requiring collateral  \narrangements. The Company may also transfer   \ncounterparty credit risk related to interest  \nrate swaps to third parties through the use of\nrisk participation agreements. In addition,   \ncertain interest rate swaps, interest rate    \nforwards and credit contracts are required to \nbe centrally cleared through clearinghouses to\nfurther mitigate counterparty credit risk. The\nCompany may mitigate credit risk on loans or  \nlending portfolios through the use of credit  \ncontracts.                                    \n                      \n  22    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nFor additional information on derivatives and \nhedging activities, refer to Notes 13 and 14  \nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial        \nStatements. LIBOR Transition In July 2017, the\nUnited Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority  \n(the \u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it would no longer \nrequire banks to submit rates for the London  \nInterBank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) after 2021.  \nIn March 2021, the FCA and the administrator  \nof LIBOR announced that, with respect to the  \nmost commonly used tenors of United States    \nDollar LIBOR, LIBOR will no longer be         \npublished on a representative basis after June\n30, 2023. The publication of all other tenors \nof United States Dollar LIBOR, as well as all \nnon-United States Dollar LIBOR tenors, ceased \nto be provided or ceased to be representative \nafter December 31, 2021. The Company holds    \nfinancial instruments impacted by the         \ndiscontinuance of LIBOR, including certain    \nloans, investment securities, derivatives,    \nborrowings and other financial instruments    \nthat use LIBOR as the benchmark rate. The     \nCompany also provides various services to     \ncustomers in its capacities as trustee,       \nservicer, and asset manager, which involve    \nfinancial instruments that will be similarly  \nimpacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR. In   \norder to facilitate the transition process,   \nthe Company has instituted a LIBOR Transition \nOffice and commenced an enterprise-wide       \nproject to (1) identify, assess, monitor and  \nmitigate risks associated with the expected   \ndiscontinuance or unavailability of LIBOR, (2)\nactively engage with industry working groups  \nand regulators, (3) develop and implement     \ntraining and education materials with respect \nto LIBOR and its discontinuance for the       \nCompany and for customers, (4) achieve        \noperational readiness for the use of          \nalternative reference rates (\u201cARRs\u201d) in new   \nfinancial instruments and transition existing \nLIBOR financial instruments to ARRs, (5)      \ndevelop and implement customer notification   \nprograms across the Company and engage        \nimpacted customers to remediate and transition\nimpacted instruments, and (6) develop         \nreporting on remediation of LIBOR instruments \nacross the Company for both internal and      \nexternal stakeholders. The Company has also   \ninvested in updating its systems, models,     \nprocedures and internal infrastructure as part\nof the transition program. The Company        \ntransitioned its financial instruments        \nassociated to LIBOR currencies and tenors that\nceased or became nonrepresentative on December\n31, 2021, to ARRs, with limited exceptions.   \nAdditionally, in alignment with guidance from \nUnited States banking agencies and the FCA,   \nthe Company has ceased the use of LIBOR as a  \nreference rate in new contracts, with limited \nexceptions, and continues to increase the     \nusage of ARRs such as the Secured Overnight   \nFinancing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). The Company also     \nanticipates that additional financial         \ninstruments associated with the remaining     \nUnited States Dollar LIBOR tenors will require\ntransition to a new reference rate by June 30,\n2023. The Company has been undergoing an      \nenterprise-wide effort to proactively reprice \nLIBOR loans and derivatives that mature after \nJune 30, 2023, with customers to an ARR. The  \nCompany has also adopted industry best        \npractice guidelines for fallback language for \nnew transactions, converted its cleared       \ninterest rate swaps discounting to SOFR       \ndiscounting, and distributed communications   \nrelated to the transition to certain impacted \nparties, both inside and outside the Company. \nThe Company\u2019s MUB acquisition impacts the     \nexecution of the Company\u2019s LIBOR transition   \nstrategies and execution plans. The Company is\ncurrently assessing MUB\u2019s LIBOR transition    \nprogram, remediation strategies, and          \npreparedness to execute on remediation        \nstrategies. In certain instances, the Company \nand MUB have different remediation strategies.\nAs a result, the Company is updating its LIBOR\ntransition plans to ensure that the Company   \ncan execute remediation plans across all      \nproducts and business units, including with   \nrespect to MUB. The Company is currently      \nassessing the applicability and scope of the  \nAdjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the     \n\u201cLIBOR Act\u201d), which was enacted on March 15,  \n2022, and the Regulations Implementing the    \nAdjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act          \n(Regulation ZZ) (the \u201cFinal Rules\u201d), which    \nwere implemented on December 16, 2022. The    \nLIBOR Act and Final Rules establish a process \nfor replacing LIBOR in existing LIBOR         \ncontracts that do not provide for the use of a\nclearly defined or practicable replacement    \nbenchmark rate by providing that a benchmark  \nreplacement identified by the Federal Reserve \nBoard that is based on SOFR will replace LIBOR\nas the benchmark for those contracts as a     \nmatter of law, without the need to be amended \nby the parties. The Company is currently      \nassessing its outstanding LIBOR portfolio to  \ndetermine the eligibility of certain financial\ninstruments for the LIBOR Act and will        \nincorporate the LIBOR Act as a remediation    \nstrategy where prudent. Refer to \u201cRisk        \nFactors\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on    \nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31,     \n2022, for further discussion on potential     \nrisks that could adversely affect the         \nCompany\u2019s financial results as a result of the\nLIBOR transition. Market Risk Management In   \naddition to interest rate risk, the Company is\nexposed to other forms of market risk,        \nprincipally related to trading activities     \nwhich support customers\u2019 strategies to manage \ntheir own foreign currency, interest rate risk\nand funding activities. For                   \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    23  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \npurposes of its internal capital adequacy     \nassessment process, the Company considers risk\narising from its trading activities, as well  \nas the remeasurement volatility of foreign    \ncurrency denominated balances included on its \nConsolidated Balance Sheet (collectively,     \n\u201cCovered Positions\u201d), employing methodologies \nconsistent with the requirements of regulatory\nrules for market risk. The Company\u2019s Market   \nRisk Committee (\u201cMRC\u201d), within the framework  \nof the ALCO, oversees market risk management. \nThe MRC monitors and reviews the Company\u2019s    \nCovered Positions and establishes policies for\nmarket risk management, including exposure    \nlimits for each portfolio. The Company uses a \nVaR approach to measure general market risk.  \nTheoretically, VaR represents the statistical \nrisk of loss the Company has to adverse market\nmovements over a one-day time horizon. The    \nCompany uses the Historical Simulation method \nto calculate VaR for its Covered Positions    \nmeasured at the ninety-ninth percentile using \na one-year look-back period for distributions \nderived from past market data. The market     \nfactors used in the calculations include those\npertinent to market risks inherent in the     \nunderlying trading portfolios, principally    \nthose that affect the Company\u2019s corporate bond\ntrading business, foreign currency transaction\nbusiness, client derivatives business, loan   \ntrading business and municipal securities     \nbusiness, as well as those inherent in the    \nCompany\u2019s foreign denominated balances and the\nderivatives used to mitigate the related      \nmeasurement volatility. On average, the       \nCompany expects the one-day VaR to be exceeded\nby actual losses two to three times per year  \nrelated to these positions. The Company       \nmonitors the accuracy of internal VaR models  \nand modeling processes by back-testing model  \nperformance, regularly updating the historical\ndata used by the VaR models and regular model \nvalidations to assess the accuracy of the     \nmodels\u2019 input, processing, and reporting      \ncomponents. All models are required to be     \nindependently reviewed and approved prior to  \nbeing placed in use. If the Company were to   \nexperience market losses in excess of the     \nestimated VaR more often than expected, the   \nVaR models and associated assumptions would be\nanalyzed and adjusted. VaR amounts reflect MUB\nbeginning December 1, 2022, the day the       \nacquisition transaction closed. The average,  \nhigh, low and period-end one-day VaR amounts  \nfor the Company\u2019s Covered Positions were as   \nfollows:                                      \n                                              \n  Three Months Ended                          \n  March\u00a031                                    \n  (Dollars in                                 \n  Millions)                  2023       2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Average                 $     5    $     2  \n  High                          6          2  \n  Low                           4          1  \n  Period-end                    5          2  \n                                              \nThe Company did not experience any actual     \nlosses for its combined Covered Positions that\nexceeded VaR during the three months ended    \nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022.

These\nactivities include diversifying its funding   \nsources, stress testing, and holding readily- \nmarketable assets which can be used as a      \nsource of liquidity if needed. In addition,   \nthe Company\u2019s profitable operations, sound    \ncredit quality and strong credit ratings and  \ncapital position have enabled it to develop a \nlarge and reliable base of core deposit       \nfunding within its market areas and in        \ndomestic and global capital markets. The      \nCompany\u2019s Board of Directors approves the     \nCompany\u2019s liquidity policy. The Risk          \nManagement Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of\nDirectors oversees the Company\u2019s liquidity    \nrisk management process and approves a        \ncontingency funding plan. The ALCO reviews the\nCompany\u2019s liquidity policy and limits, and    \nregularly assesses the Company\u2019s ability to   \nmeet funding requirements arising from adverse\ncompany-specific or market events. The Company\nregularly projects its funding needs under    \nvarious stress scenarios and maintains a      \ncontingency funding plan consistent with the  \nCompany\u2019s access to diversified sources of    \ncontingent funding. The Company maintains a   \nsubstantial level of total available liquidity\nin the form of on-balance sheet and off-      \nbalance sheet funding sources. These liquidity\nsources include cash at the Federal Reserve   \nBank and certain European central banks,      \nunencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to   \nborrow from the FHLB and at the Federal       \nReserve Bank\u2019s Discount Window and new Bank   \nTerm Funding Program, created in 2023.        \nUnencumbered liquid assets in the Company\u2019s   \ninvestment securities portfolio provides asset\nliquidity through the Company\u2019s ability to    \nsell the securities or pledge and borrow      \nagainst them. At March 31, 2023, the fair     \nvalue of unencumbered investment securities   \ntotaled $130.5 billion, compared with $135.5  \nbillion at December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 4 \nof the Notes to Consolidated Financial        \nStatements and \u201cBalance Sheet Analysis\u201d for   \nfurther information on investment securities  \nmaturities and trends. Asset liquidity is     \nfurther enhanced by the Company\u2019s practice of \npledging loans to access secured borrowing    \nfacilities through the FHLB and Federal       \nReserve Bank.

Total deposits were $505.3 billion at\nMarch 31, 2023, compared with $525.0 billion  \nat December 31, 2022. Refer to \u201cBalance Sheet \nAnalysis\u201d for further information on the      \nCompany\u2019s deposits. Additional funding is     \nprovided by long-term debt and short-term     \nborrowings. Long-term debt was $42.0 billion  \nat March 31, 2023, and is an important funding\nsource because of its multi-year borrowing    \nstructure. Short-term borrowings were $56.9   \nbillion at March 31, 2023, and supplement the \nCompany\u2019s other funding sources. Depositors   \nand investors often consider the credit rating\nof a Company. The Company receives various    \ncredit ratings from four separate credit      \nrating agencies and has strong investment     \ngrade ratings from all agencies. After the    \nfirst quarter of 2023, one credit rating      \nagency, Moody\u2019s Investors Service, downgraded \nits credit rating of the Company which is now \nin line with other large regional banks. Refer\nto \u201cBalance Sheet Analysis\u201d for further       \ninformation on the Company\u2019s long-term debt   \nand short-term borrowings. In addition to     \nassessing liquidity risk on a consolidated    \nbasis, the Company monitors the parent        \ncompany\u2019s liquidity. The parent company\u2019s     \nroutine funding requirements consist primarily\nof operating expenses, dividends paid to      \nshareholders, debt service, repurchases of    \ncommon stock and funds used for acquisitions. \nThe parent company obtains funding to meet its\nobligations from dividends collected from its \nsubsidiaries and the issuance of debt and     \ncapital securities. The Company establishes   \nlimits for the                                \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    25  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nminimal number of months into the future where\nthe parent company can meet existing and      \nforecasted obligations with cash and          \nsecurities held that can be readily monetized.\nThe Company measures and manages this limit in\nboth normal and adverse conditions. The       \nCompany maintains sufficient funding to meet  \nexpected capital and debt service obligations \nfor 24 months without the support of dividends\nfrom subsidiaries and assuming access to the  \nwholesale markets is maintained. The Company  \nmaintains sufficient liquidity to meet its    \ncapital and debt service obligations for 12   \nmonths under adverse conditions without the   \nsupport of dividends from subsidiaries or     \naccess to the wholesale markets. The parent   \ncompany is currently in excess of required    \nliquidity minimums. At March 31, 2023, parent \ncompany long-term debt outstanding was $30.8  \nbillion, compared with $27.0 billion at       \nDecember 31, 2022. The increase was primarily \ndue to $3.7 billion of medium-term note       \nissuances. As of March 31, 2023, there was no \nparent company debt scheduled to mature in the\nremainder of 2023. Future debt maturities may \nbe met through medium-term note and capital   \nsecurity issuances and dividends from         \nsubsidiaries, as well as from parent company  \ncash and cash equivalents. The Company is     \nsubject to a regulatory Liquidity Coverage    \nRatio (\u201cLCR\u201d) requirement which requires banks\nto maintain an adequate level of unencumbered \nhigh quality liquid assets to meet estimated  \nliquidity needs over a 30-day stressed period.\nAt March 31, 2023, the Company was compliant  \nwith this requirement. The Company is also    \nsubject to a regulatory Net Stable Funding    \nRatio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) requirement which requires     \nbanks to maintain a minimum level of stable   \nfunding based on the liquidity characteristics\nof their assets, commitments, and derivative  \nexposures over a one-year time horizon. At    \nMarch 31, 2023, the Company was compliant with\nthis requirement. Refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s      \nDiscussion and Analysis \u2014 Liquidity Risk      \nManagement\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on \nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31,     \n2022, for further discussion on liquidity risk\nmanagement. European Exposures The Company    \nprovides merchant processing and corporate    \ntrust services in Europe either directly or   \nthrough banking affiliations in Europe.       \nRevenue generated from sources in Europe      \nrepresented approximately 2 percent of the    \nCompany\u2019s total net revenue for the three     \nmonths ended March 31, 2023. Operating cash   \nfor these businesses is deposited on a short- \nterm basis typically with certain European    \ncentral banks. For deposits placed at other   \nEuropean banks, exposure is mitigated by the  \nCompany placing deposits at multiple banks and\nmanaging the amounts on deposit at any bank   \nbased on institution-specific deposit limits. \nAt March 31, 2023, the Company had an         \naggregate amount on deposit with European     \nbanks of approximately $7.5 billion,          \npredominately with the Central Bank of Ireland\nand Bank of England. In addition, the Company \nprovides financing to domestic multinational  \ncorporations that generate revenue from       \ncustomers in European countries, transacts    \nwith various European banks as counterparties \nto certain derivative-related activities, and \nthrough a subsidiary, manages money market    \nfunds that hold certain investments in        \nEuropean sovereign debt. Any deterioration in \neconomic conditions in Europe, including the  \nimpacts resulting from the Russia-Ukraine     \nconflict, is not expected to have a           \nsignificant effect on the Company related to  \nthese activities. Commitments, Contingent     \nLiabilities and Other Contractual Obligations \nThe Company participates in many different    \ncontractual arrangements which may or may not \nbe recorded on its balance sheet, with        \nunrelated or consolidated entities, under     \nwhich the Company has an obligation to pay    \ncertain amounts, provide credit or liquidity  \nenhancements or provide market risk support.  \nThese arrangements include commitments to     \nextend credit, letters of credit and various  \nforms of guarantees. Refer to Note 16 of the  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements for\nfurther information on guarantees and         \ncontingent liabilities. These arrangements    \nalso include any obligation related to a      \nvariable interest held in an unconsolidated   \nentity that provides financing, liquidity,    \ncredit enhancement or market risk support.    \nRefer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated  \nFinancial Statements for further information  \nrelated to the Company\u2019s interests in variable\ninterest entities.

\n                                              \nCapital Management The Company is committed to\nmanaging capital to maintain strong protection\nfor depositors and creditors and for maximum  \nshareholder benefit. The Company also manages \nits capital to exceed regulatory capital      \nrequirements for banking organizations. To    \nachieve its capital goals, the Company employs\na variety of capital management tools,        \nincluding dividends, common share repurchases,\nand the issuance of subordinated debt, non-   \ncumulative perpetual preferred stock, common  \nstock and other capital instruments. The      \nregulatory capital requirements effective for \nthe Company follow Basel III, with the Company\nbeing subject to calculating its capital      \nadequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted     \nassets under the standardized approach.       \nBeginning in 2022, the Company began to phase \ninto its regulatory capital requirements the  \ncumulative deferred impact of its 2020        \nadoption of the accounting guidance related to\nthe impairment of financial instruments based \non the current expected credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d)\nmethodology plus 25 percent of its quarterly  \ncredit reserve increases during 2020 and 2021.\nThis cumulative deferred impact will continue \nto be phased into the Company\u2019s regulatory    \ncapital over the next two years, culminating  \nwith a fully phased in regulatory capital     \ncalculation beginning in 2025. Table 10       \nprovides a summary of statutory regulatory    \ncapital ratios in effect for the Company at   \nMarch 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. All     \nregulatory ratios exceeded regulatory \u201cwell-  \ncapitalized\u201d requirements. The Company        \nbelieves certain other capital ratios are     \nuseful in evaluating its capital adequacy. The\nCompany\u2019s tangible common equity, as a percent\nof tangible assets and as a percent of risk-  \nweighted assets determined in accordance with \ntransitional regulatory capital requirements  \nrelated to the CECL methodology under the     \nstandardized approach, was 4.8 percent and 6.5\npercent, respectively, at March 31, 2023,     \ncompared with 4.5 percent and 6.0 percent,    \nrespectively, at December 31, 2022. In        \naddition, the Company\u2019s common equity tier 1  \ncapital to risk-weighted assets ratio,        \nreflecting the full implementation of the CECL\nmethodology was 8.3 percent at March 31, 2023,\ncompared with 8.1 percent at December 31,     \n2022. Refer to \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d  \nbeginning on page 31 for further information  \non these other capital ratios. Total U.S.     \nBancorp shareholders\u2019 equity was $53.0 billion\nat March 31, 2023, compared with $50.8 billion\nat December 31, 2022. The increase was        \nprimarily the result of corporate earnings and\nchanges in unrealized gains and losses on     \navailable-for-sale investment securities      \nincluded in other comprehensive income (loss),\npartially offset by dividends paid. The       \nCompany announced on December 22, 2020 that   \nits Board of Directors had approved an        \nauthorization to repurchase $3.0 billion of   \nits common stock beginning January 1, 2021.   \nThe Company suspended all common stock        \nrepurchases at the beginning of the third     \nquarter of 2021, except for those done        \nexclusively in connection with its stock-based\ncompensation programs, due to its acquisition \nof MUB. The Company does not expect to        \nevaluate potential repurchases until its      \ncommon equity tier 1 capital ratio is 9.0     \npercent, at which time the Company will       \nevaluate the potential capital requirements   \ngiven the regulatory landscape. Capital       \ndistributions, including dividends and stock  \nrepurchases, are subject to the approval of   \nthe Company\u2019s Board of Directors and          \ncompliance with regulatory requirements.      \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    27  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe following table provides a detailed       \nanalysis of all shares of common stock of the \nCompany purchased by the Company or any       \naffiliated purchaser during the first quarter \nof 2023:                                      \n                                              \n                                        App\u2026  \n                                        Dol\u2026  \n                                          of  \n                              To\u2026       Sha\u2026  \n                              Nu\u2026        May  \n                               of        Yet  \n        To\u2026           Ave\u2026    Sh\u2026       BeP\u2026  \n        Nu\u2026           Pri\u2026    Pu\u2026       Und\u2026  \n         of           Paid    Pa\u2026       Pro\u2026  \n        Sh\u2026            Per     of        (In  \n  P\u2026    Pu\u2026           Sha\u2026    Pu\u2026       Mil\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  J\u2026    15\u2026  -a    $  48.\u2026    9,\u2026    $  1,3\u2026  \n  F\u2026    37\u2026           48.\u2026    37\u2026       1,3\u2026  \n  M\u2026    1,\u2026  -b       40.\u2026    55\u2026       1,3\u2026  \n  T\u2026    1,\u2026  -c    $  42.\u2026    93\u2026    $  1,3\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Includes 150,000 shares of common      \n       stock purchased, at an average price   \n       per share of $48.35, in open-market    \n       transactions by U.S. Bank National     \n  (a)  Association, the Company\u2019s primary     \n       banking subsidiary, in its capacity    \n       as trustee of the U.S. Bank 401(k)     \n       Savings Plan, which is the Company\u2019s   \n       employee retirement savings plan.      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Includes910,000shares of common stock  \n       purchased, at an average price per     \n       share of $36.43, in open-market        \n  (b)  transactions by U.S. Bank National     \n       Association in its capacity as         \n       trustee of the U.S. Bank 401(k)        \n       Savings Plan.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Includes 1,060,000 shares of common    \n       stock purchased, at an average price   \n       per share of $38.12, in open-market    \n  (c)  transactions by U.S. Bank National     \n       Association in its capacity as         \n       trustee of the U.S. Bank 401(k)        \n       Savings Plan.                          \n                                              \nRefer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u2014 Capital Management\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual \nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended        \nDecember 31, 2022, for further discussion on  \ncapital management. LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL\nREVIEW The Company\u2019s major lines of business  \nare Corporate and Commercial Banking, Consumer\nand Business Banking, Wealth Management and   \nInvestment Services, Payment Services, and    \nTreasury and Corporate Support. These         \noperating segments are components of the      \nCompany about which financial information is  \nprepared and is evaluated regularly by        \nmanagement in deciding how to allocate        \nresources and assess performance. Basis for   \nFinancial Presentation Business line results  \nare derived from the Company\u2019s business unit  \nprofitability reporting systems by            \nspecifically attributing managed balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and    \ntheir related income or expense. Refer to Note\n17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial     \nStatements for further information on the     \nbusiness lines\u2019 basis for financial           \npresentation. Designations, assignments and   \nallocations change from time to time as       \nmanagement systems are enhanced, methods of   \nevaluating performance or product lines change\nor business segments are realigned to better  \nrespond to the Company\u2019s diverse customer     \nbase. During 2023, certain organization and   \nmethodology changes were made and,            \naccordingly, 2022 results were restated and   \npresented on a comparable basis. Corporate and\nCommercial Banking Corporate and Commercial   \nBanking offers lending, equipment finance and \nsmall-ticket leasing, depository services,    \ntreasury management, capital markets services,\ninternational trade services and other        \nfinancial services to middle market, large    \ncorporate, commercial real estate, financial  \ninstitution, non-profit and public sector     \nclients. Corporate and Commercial Banking     \ncontributed $580 million of the Company\u2019s net \nincome in the first quarter of 2023, or an    \nincrease of $172 million (42.2 percent)       \ncompared with the first quarter of 2022. Net  \nrevenue increased $397 million (40.0 percent) \nin the first quarter of 2023, compared with   \nthe first quarter of 2022. Net interest       \nincome, on a taxable-equivalent basis,        \nincreased $335 million (44.9 percent) in the  \nfirst quarter of 2023, compared with the first\nquarter of 2022. The increase was primarily   \ndue to the impacts of the MUB acquisition,    \nhigher loan balances and the impact of higher \nrates on the margin benefit from deposits,    \npartially offset by lower spreads on loans and\nlower noninterest-bearing deposits.           \nNoninterest income increased $62 million (25.1\npercent) in the first quarter of 2023,        \ncompared with the first quarter of 2022,      \nprimarily due to the MUB acquisition and      \nhigher commercial products revenue mainly due \nto higher trading revenue. Noninterest expense\nincreased $169 million (38.1 percent) in the  \nfirst quarter of 2023, compared with the first\nquarter of 2022, primarily due to higher FDIC \ninsurance expense, higher net shared services \nexpense driven by investment in support of    \nbusiness growth and the impacts of the MUB    \nacquisition, including intangible amortization\ndriven by the core deposit intangible. The    \nprovision for credit losses decreased $2      \nmillion (40.0 percent) in the first quarter of\n2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022,\nprimarily due to slower ending loan balance   \ngrowth in the current year.                   \n                      \n  28    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table\u00a011    Line of Business Financial      \n              Performance                     \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                     \n  *  Not meaningful  \n                     \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    29  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nConsumer and Business BankingConsumer and     \nBusiness Banking comprises consumer banking,  \nsmall business banking and consumer lending.  \nProducts and services are delivered through   \nbanking offices, telephone servicing and      \nsales, on-line services, direct mail, ATM     \nprocessing, mobile devices, distributed       \nmortgage loan officers, and intermediary      \nrelationships including auto dealerships,     \nmortgage banks, and strategic business        \npartners.

Noninterest income decreased \n$57 million (12.6 percent) in the first       \nquarter of 2023, compared with the first      \nquarter of 2022, primarily due to lower       \nmortgage banking revenue reflecting lower     \napplication volume, lower related gain on sale\nmargins and fewer performing loan sales,      \npartially offset by an increase in the fair   \nvalue of MSRs, net of hedging activities.     \nNoninterest income further decreased due to   \nlower residual gains on vehicle sales and the \nimpact of pricing changes on deposit service  \ncharges, partially offset by the impact of the\nMUB acquisition. Noninterest expense increased\n$378 million (27.0 percent) in the first      \nquarter of 2023, compared with the first      \nquarter of 2022, primarily due to increases in\nnet shared services expense due to investments\nin digital capabilities and the impact of the \nMUB acquisition, including intangible         \namortization driven by the core deposit       \nintangible, as well as lower capitalized loan \ncosts driven by lower mortgage production. The\nprovision for credit losses decreased $35     \nmillion (72.9 percent) in the first quarter of\n2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022,\ndue to a more favorable product mix in the    \ncurrent year.

Net interest income, on a    \ntaxable-equivalent basis, increased $212      \nmillion (76.8 percent) in the first quarter of\n2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022,\nprimarily due to the favorable impact of      \nhigher rates on the margin benefit from       \ndeposits. Noninterest income increased $105   \nmillion (17.6 percent) in the first quarter of\n2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022,\nprimarily driven by higher trust and          \ninvestment management fees reflecting lower   \nmoney market fund fee waivers and the impacts \nof the MUB acquisition, partially offset by   \nthe impact of unfavorable market conditions.  \nNoninterest expense increased $110 million    \n(19.7 percent) in the first quarter of 2023,  \ncompared with the first quarter of 2022,      \nreflecting higher compensation and employee   \nbenefits expense as a result of merit         \nincreases and core business growth, higher net\nshared services expense driven by investment  \nin support of business growth and the impact  \nof the MUB acquisition. The provision for     \ncredit losses decreased $20 million in the    \nfirst quarter of 2023, compared with the first\nquarter of 2022, primarily due to slower      \nending loan balance growth in the current     \nyear.

As a result, there was strong growth \nin corporate payment products revenue driven  \nby improving business spending across all     \nproduct groups. In addition, merchant         \nprocessing services revenue increased due to  \nhigher sales volume and higher merchant fees, \npartially offset by the impact of foreign     \ncurrency rate changes in Europe.              \n                      \n  30    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nNoninterest expense increased $66 million (7.8\npercent) in the first quarter of 2023,        \ncompared with the first quarter of 2022,      \nreflecting higher net shared services expense \ndriven by investment in infrastructure and    \ntechnology development, in addition to higher \ncompensation and employee benefits expense due\nto merit increases and core business growth.  \nThe provision for credit losses increased $96 \nmillion (73.8 percent) in the first quarter of\n2023, compared with the first quarter of 2022,\nprimarily due to the impacts of increasing    \ndelinquency rates and lower consumer          \nliquidity.

Treasury and Corporate    \nSupport recorded a net loss of $308 million in\nthe first quarter of 2023, compared with net  \nincome of $163 million in the first quarter of\n2022. Net revenue decreased $2 million (0.7   \npercent) in the first quarter of 2023,        \ncompared with the first quarter of 2022.      \nNoninterest income decreased $79 million (32.5\npercent) in the first quarter of 2023,        \ncompared with the first quarter of 2022,      \nprimarily due to lower tax-advantaged         \ninvestment syndication revenue and securities \nlosses. Net interest income, on a taxable-    \nequivalent basis, increased $77 million in the\nfirst quarter of 2023, compared with the first\nquarter of 2022, primarily due to the         \nacquisition of MUB, partially offset by higher\nfunding costs. Noninterest expense increased  \n$330 million in the first quarter of 2023,    \ncompared with the first quarter of 2022,      \nprimarily due to merger and integration       \ncharges and operating expenses related to the \nacquisition of MUB, higher compensation and   \nemployee benefits expense reflecting merit    \nincreases, hiring to support business growth, \ncore business growth and higher production    \nincentives, partially offset by lower net     \nshared services expense. The provision for    \ncredit losses increased $276 million in the   \nfirst quarter of 2023, compared with the first\nquarter of 2022, primarily due to increased   \neconomic uncertainty in the current year      \ncompared to the reduction in the allowance for\ncredit losses associated with improving       \neconomic conditions in the first quarter of   \n2022. Income taxes are assessed to each line  \nof business at a managerial tax rate of 25.0  \npercent with the residual tax expense or      \nbenefit to arrive at the consolidated         \neffective tax rate included in Treasury and   \nCorporate Support. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn addition to capital ratios defined by      \nbanking regulators, the Company considers     \nvarious other measures when evaluating capital\nutilization and adequacy, including:          \n                                              \n  \u2022    Tangible common equity to tangible     \n       assets,                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Tangible common equity to              \n       risk-weighted assets, and              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Common equity tier\u00a01 capital to        \n  \u2022    risk-weighted assets, reflecting the   \n       full implementation of the CECL        \n       methodology.                           \n                                              \nThese capital measures are viewed by          \nmanagement as useful additional methods of    \nevaluating the Company\u2019s utilization of its   \ncapital held and the level of capital         \navailable to withstand unexpected negative    \nmarket or economic conditions. Additionally,  \npresentation of these measures allows         \ninvestors, analysts and banking regulators to \nassess the Company\u2019s capital position relative\nto other financial services companies. These  \ncapital measures are not defined in generally \naccepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), or   \nare not currently effective or defined in     \nbanking regulations. In addition, certain of  \nthese measures differ from currently effective\ncapital ratios defined by banking regulations \nprincipally in that the currently effective   \nratios, which are subject to certain          \ntransitional provisions, temporarily exclude  \nthe impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting \nguidance related to impairment of financial   \ninstruments based on the CECL methodology. As \na result, these capital measures disclosed by \nthe Company may be considered non-GAAP        \nfinancial measures. Management believes this  \ninformation helps investors assess trends in  \nthe Company\u2019s capital adequacy. The Company   \nalso discloses net interest income and related\nratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent   \nbasis, which may also be considered non-GAAP  \nfinancial measures. The Company believes this \npresentation to be the preferred industry     \nmeasurement of net interest income as it      \nprovides a relevant comparison of net interest\nincome arising from taxable and tax-exempt    \nsources. In addition, certain performance     \nmeasures, including the efficiency ratio and  \nnet interest margin utilize net interest      \nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis. There   \nmay be limits in the usefulness of these      \nmeasures to investors. As a result, the       \nCompany encourages readers to consider the    \nconsolidated financial statements and other   \nfinancial information contained in this report\nin their entirety, and not to

accounting principles generally accepted \nin the United States and conform to general   \npractices within the banking industry. The    \npreparation of financial statements in        \nconformity with GAAP requires management to   \nmake estimates and assumptions. The Company\u2019s \nfinancial position and results of operations  \ncan be affected by these estimates and        \nassumptions, which are integral to            \nunderstanding the Company\u2019s financial         \nstatements. Critical accounting policies are  \nthose policies management believes are the    \nmost important to the portrayal of the        \nCompany\u2019s financial condition and results, and\nrequire management to make estimates that are \ndifficult, subjective or complex. Most        \naccounting policies are not considered by     \nmanagement to be critical accounting policies.\nManagement has discussed the development and  \nthe selection of critical accounting policies \nwith the Company\u2019s Audit Committee. Those     \npolicies considered to be critical accounting \npolicies relate to the allowance for credit   \nlosses, fair value estimates, MSRs, and income\ntaxes. These accounting policies are discussed\nin detail in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and     \nAnalysis \u2014 Critical Accounting Policies\u201d and  \nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K   \nfor the year ended December 31, 2022. CONTROLS\nAND PROCEDURES Under the supervision and with \nthe participation of the Company\u2019s management,\nincluding its principal executive officer and \nprincipal financial officer, the Company has  \nevaluated the effectiveness of the design and \noperation of its disclosure controls and      \nprocedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and \n15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)). Based upon this   \nevaluation, the principal executive officer   \nand principal financial officer have concluded\nthat, as of the end of the period covered by  \nthis report, the Company\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures were effective. The Company    \ncontinues to integrate MUB into its overall   \ninternal control over financial reporting     \nprocesses. During the most recently completed \nfiscal quarter, there were no other changes   \nmade in the Company\u2019s internal control over   \nfinancial reporting (as defined in Rules      \n13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange    \nAct) that have materially affected, or are    \nreasonably likely to materially affect, the   \nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial     \nreporting.

In the opinion of          \nmanagement of U.S.\u00a0Bancorp (the \u201cCompany\u201d),   \nall adjustments (consisting only of normal    \nrecurring adjustments) necessary for a fair   \nstatement of results for the interim periods  \nhave been made. These financial statements and\nnotes should be read in conjunction with the  \nconsolidated financial statements and notes   \nincluded in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on    \nForm\u00a010-K for the year ended December\u00a031,     \n2022. Certain amounts in prior periods have   \nbeen reclassified to conform to the current   \nperiod presentation.                          \n                                \n  Note\u00a02    Accounting Changes  \n                                \nReference Interest Rate Transition In March   \n2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(\u201cFASB\u201d) issued accounting guidance, providing\ntemporary optional expedients and exceptions  \nto the guidance in United States generally    \naccepted accounting principles on contract    \nmodifications and hedge accounting, to ease   \nthe financial reporting burdens related to the\nexpected market transition from the London    \nInterbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and other    \ninterbank offered rates to alternative        \nreference rates. Under the guidance, a company\ncan elect not to apply certain modification   \naccounting requirements to contracts affected \nby reference rate transition, if certain      \ncriteria are met. A company that makes this   \nelection would not be required to remeasure   \nthe contracts at the modification date or     \nreassess a previous accounting determination. \nThis guidance also permits a company to elect \nvarious optional expedients that would allow  \nit to continue applying hedge accounting for  \nhedging relationships affected by reference   \nrate transition, if certain criteria are met. \nThe guidance is effective upon issuance and   \ngenerally can be applied through December\u00a031, \n2024. The Company is applying certain optional\nexpedients and exceptions for cash flow hedges\nand will continue to evaluate these for       \neligible contract modifications and hedging   \nrelationships.                                \nFair Value Hedging \u2013 Portfolio Layer Method   \nEffective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted\naccounting guidance, issued by the FASB in    \nMarch 2022, related to fair value hedge       \naccounting of portfolios of financial assets. \nThis guidance permits a company to designate  \nmultiple hedging relationships on a single    \nclosed portfolio, resulting in a larger       \nportion of the interest rate risk associated  \nwith such a portfolio being eligible to be    \nhedged. The guidance also expands the scope of\nthe method to include non-prepayable financial\nassets and clarifies other technical questions\nfrom the original accounting guidance. The    \nadoption of this guidance was not material to \nthe Company\u2019s financial statements.           \nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Troubled Debt         \nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures        \nEffective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted\naccounting guidance on a modified             \nretrospective basis, issued by the FASB in    \nMarch 2022, related to the recognition and    \nmeasurement of troubled debt restructurings   \n(\u201cTDRs\u201d) by creditors. This guidance removes  \nthe separate recognition and measurement      \nrequirements for TDRs by replacing them with a\nrequirement for a company to apply existing   \naccounting guidance to determine whether a    \nmodification results in a new loan or a       \ncontinuation of an existing loan. This        \nguidance also replaces existing TDR           \ndisclosures with similar but more expansive   \ndisclosures for certain modifications of      \nreceivables made to borrowers experiencing    \nfinancial difficulty. Further, this guidance  \nalso requires companies to disclose current-  \nperiod gross write-offs by year of origination\nfor financing receivables. The adoption of    \nthis guidance was not material to the         \nCompany\u2019s financial statements.               \nAccounting for Tax Credit Investments Using   \nthe Proportional Amortization Method Effective\nJanuary 1, 2023, the Company adopted          \naccounting guidance on a modified             \nretrospective basis, issued by the FASB in    \nMarch 2023, related to the accounting for tax \ncredit investments. This guidance allows the  \nCompany to elect to account for tax credit    \ninvestments using the proportional            \namortization method on a program-by-program   \nbasis if certain conditions are met,          \nregardless of the program from which the      \nincome tax credits are received. The adoption \nof this guidance was not material to the      \nCompany\u2019s financial statements.               \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    39  \n                      \nTable of Contents\n                                    \n  Note\u00a0\u00a03    Business Combinations  \n                                    \nMUFG Union Bank Acquisition On December 1,    \n2022, the Company acquired MUB\u2019s core regional\nbanking franchise from Mitsubishi UFJ         \nFinancial Group, Inc. (\u201cMUFG\u201d). Pursuant to   \nthe terms of theShare Purchase Agreement, the \nCompany acquired all of the issued and        \noutstanding shares of common stock of MUB for \na purchase price consisting of $ 5.5billion in\ncash and approximately 44million shares of    \ncommon stock of the Company. Under the terms  \nof the Share Purchase Agreement, the purchase \nprice was based on MUB having a tangible book \nvalue of $ 6.25billion at the closing of the  \nacquisition. At the closing of the            \nacquisition, MUB had $ 3.5 billion of tangible\nbook value over the $ 6.25 billion target,    \nconsisting of additional cash. The additional \ncash received is held at the MUB subsidiary   \nand is required to be repaid to MUFG on or    \nprior to the fifth anniversary date of the    \ncompletion of the purchase, in accordance with\nthe terms of the Share Purchase Agreement. As \nsuch, it is recognized as debt at the parent  \ncompany. The transaction excludes the purchase\nof substantially all of MUB\u2019s Global Corporate\n& Investment Bank (other than certain         \ndeposits), certain middle and back office     \nfunctions, and other assets that were         \ntransferred by MUB to MUFG prior to the       \nacquisition. This transaction has been        \naccounted for as a business combination.      \nAccordingly, the assets acquired and          \nliabilities assumed from MUB were recorded at \nfair value as of the acquisition date. The    \ndetermination of fair value requires          \nmanagement to make estimates about discount   \nrates, future expected cash flows, market     \nconditions and other future events that are   \nhighly subjective in nature and subject to    \nchange. Fair value estimates related to the   \nassets and liabilities from MUB are subject to\nadjustment for up to one year after the       \nclosing date of the acquisition as additional \ninformation becomes available. Valuations     \nsubject to adjustment include, but are not    \nlimited to, loans, certain deposits, certain  \nother assets, customer relationships and the  \ncore deposit benefits intangible.             \nIn connection with the transaction, the       \nCompany incurred $ 244 million of nonrecurring\nmerger and integration charges during the     \nthree months ended March\u00a031, 2023 recorded    \nwithin noninterest expense. These expenses are\nprimarily comprised of personnel, legal,      \nadvisory and technology related costs.        \nThe following table includes the fair value of\nconsideration transferred and the preliminary \nfair value of the identifiable tangible and   \nintangible assets and liabilities from MUB:   \n                                              \n                December 1,                   \n                2022 (Dollars                 \n                in                            \n                Millions)                     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Acquisition                                 \n  considerati\u2026                                \n  Cash                         $    5,500     \n  Market value                                \n  of shares of                      2,014     \n  common stock                                \n  Total                                       \n  considerati\u2026                                \n  transferred                       7,514     \n  at                                          \n  acquisition                                 \n  close date                                  \n  Discounted                                  \n  liability to                      2,944     \n  MUFG (a)                                    \n  Total                        $   10,458     \n  Fair Value                                  \n  of MUB                                      \n  assets and                                  \n  liabilities                                 \n  Assets                                      \n  Cash and due                 $   17,754     \n  from banks                                  \n  Investment                       22,725     \n  securities                                  \n  Loans held                        2,220     \n  for sale                                    \n  Loans                            53,395     \n  Less                                        \n  allowance                          (463  )  \n  for loan                                    \n  losses                                      \n  Net loans                        52,932     \n  Premises and                        646     \n  equipment                                   \n  Other                                       \n  intangible                                  \n  assets                            2,808     \n  (excluding                                  \n  goodwill)                                   \n  Other assets                      4,700     \n  Total assets                 $  103,785     \n  Liabilities                                 \n  Deposits                     $   86,110     \n  Short-term                        4,773     \n  borrowings                                  \n  Long-term                         2,584     \n  debt                                        \n  Other                             2,267     \n  liabilities                                 \n  Total                            95,734     \n  liabilities                                 \n  Less: Net                    $    8,051     \n  assets                                      \n  Goodwill                     $    2,407     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents $3.5billion of              \n       noninterest-bearing                    \n       additionalcashheld by MUB upon close   \n       of the acquisition to be delivered to  \n  (a)  MUFG on or prior to December\u00a01, 2027,  \n       discounted at the Company\u2019s 5-year     \n       unsecured borrowing rate as of the     \n       acquisition date, per authoritative    \n       accounting guidance.                   \n                                              \n                      \n  40    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nPreliminary goodwill of $ 2.4billion recorded \nin connection with the transaction resulted   \nfrom the reputation, operating model and      \nexpertise of MUB.

securities  \nwith unrealized losses to determine whether   \nall or some portion of a security\u2019s unrealized\nloss is related to credit and an allowance for\ncredit losses is necessary. If the Company    \nintends to sell or it is more likely than not \nthe Company will be required to sell an       \ninvestment security, the amortized cost of the\nsecurity is written down to fair value. When  \nevaluating credit losses, the Company         \nconsiders various factors such as the nature  \nof the investment security, the credit ratings\nor financial condition of the issuer, the     \nextent of the unrealized loss, expected cash  \nflows of underlying collateral, the existence \nof any government or agency guarantees, and   \nmarket conditions. The Company measures the   \nallowance for credit losses using market      \ninformation where available and discounting   \nthe cash flows at the original effective rate \nof the investment security. The allowance for \ncredit losses is adjusted each period through \nearnings and can be subsequently recovered.   \nThe allowance for credit losses on the        \nCompany\u2019s available-for-sale investment       \nsecurities was immaterial at March\u00a031, 2023   \nand December\u00a031, 2022.                        \n                                              \nAt March\u00a031, 2023, certain investment         \nsecurities had a fair value below amortized   \ncost.

U.S. Treasury and \nagencies securities and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities are issued, guaranteed or otherwise\nsupported by the United States government. The\nCompany\u2019s obligations of state and political  \nsubdivisions are generally high grade.        \nAccordingly, the Company does not consider    \nthese unrealized losses to be credit-related  \nand an allowance for credit losses is not     \nnecessary. In general, the issuers of the     \ninvestment securities are contractually       \nprohibited from prepayment at less than par,  \nand the Company did not pay significant       \npurchase premiums for these investment        \nsecurities. At March\u00a031, 2023, the Company had\nno plans to sell investment securities with   \nunrealized losses, and believes it is more    \nlikely than not it would not be required to   \nsell such investment securities before        \nrecovery of their amortized cost.             \n                                              \nDuring the three months ended March\u00a031, 2023  \nand 2022, the Company did not purchase any    \ninvestment securities that had more-than-     \ninsignificant credit deterioration.           \n                                              \nAll of the Company\u2019s held-to-maturity         \ninvestment securities are U.S. Treasury and   \nagencies securities and highly rated agency   \nmortgage-backed securities that are guaranteed\nor otherwise supported by the United States   \ngovernment and have no history of credit      \nlosses. Accordingly the Company does not      \nexpect to incur any credit losses on held-to- \nmaturity investment securities and has no     \nallowance for credit losses recorded for these\nsecurities.

Purchased loans are     \nrecorded at fair value at the date of         \npurchase. Net unearned interest and deferred  \nfees and costs on originated loans and        \nunamortized premiums and discounts on         \npurchased loans amounted to $ 2.5 billion at  \nMarch\u00a031, 2023 and $ 3.1 billion at           \nDecember\u00a031, 2022. The Company evaluates      \npurchased loans for more-than-insignificant   \ndeterioration at the date of purchase in      \naccordance with applicable authoritative      \naccounting guidance. Purchased loans that have\nexperienced more-than-insignificant           \ndeterioration from origination are considered \npurchased credit deteriorated loans. All other\npurchased loans are considered non-purchased  \ncredit deteriorated loans.                    \nAllowance for Credit Losses The allowance for \ncredit losses is established for current      \nexpected credit losses on the Company\u2019s loan  \nand lease portfolio, including unfunded credit\ncommitments. The allowance considers expected \nlosses for the remaining lives of the         \napplicable assets, inclusive of expected      \nrecoveries. The allowance for credit losses is\nincreased through provisions charged to       \nearnings and reduced by net charge-offs.      \nManagement evaluates the appropriateness of   \nthe allowance for credit losses on a quarterly\nbasis.                                        \nMultiple economic scenarios are considered    \nover a three-year reasonable and supportable  \nforecast period, which includes increasing    \nconsideration of historical loss experience   \nover years two and three. These economic      \nscenarios are constructed with interrelated   \nprojections of multiple economic variables,   \nand loss estimates are produced that consider \nthe historical correlation of those economic  \nvariables with credit losses. After the       \nforecast period, the Company fully reverts to \nlong-term historical loss experience, adjusted\nfor prepayments and characteristics of the    \ncurrent loan and lease portfolio, to estimate \nlosses over the remaining life of the         \nportfolio. The economic scenarios are updated \nat least quarterly and are designed to provide\na range of reasonable estimates, from better  \nto worse than current expectations. Scenarios \nare weighted based on the Company\u2019s           \nexpectation of economic conditions for the    \nforeseeable future and reflect significant    \njudgment and consideration of economic        \nforecast uncertainty. Final loss estimates    \nalso consider factors affecting credit losses \nnot reflected in the scenarios, due to the    \nunique aspects of current conditions and      \nexpectations. These factors may include, but  \nare not limited to, loan servicing practices, \nregulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and        \nmonetary policy actions.                      \n                      \n  44    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThe allowance recorded for credit losses      \nutilizes forward-looking expected loss models \nto consider a variety of factors affecting    \nlifetime credit losses. These factors include,\nbut are not limited to, macroeconomic         \nvariables such as unemployment rates, real    \nestate prices, gross domestic product levels, \ninflation, interest rates and corporate bonds \nspreads, as well as loan and borrower         \ncharacteristics, such as internal risk ratings\non commercial loans and consumer credit       \nscores, delinquency status, collateral type   \nand available valuation information,          \nconsideration of end-of-term losses on lease  \nresiduals, and the remaining term of the loan,\nadjusted for expected prepayments. For each   \nloan portfolio, including those loans modified\nunder various loan modification programs,     \nmodel estimates are adjusted as necessary to  \nconsider any relevant changes in portfolio    \ncomposition, lending policies, underwriting   \nstandards, risk management practices, economic\nconditions or other factors that would affect \nthe accuracy of the model. Expected credit    \nloss estimates also include consideration of  \nexpected cash recoveries on loans previously  \ncharged-off or expected recoveries on         \ncollateral dependent loans where recovery is  \nexpected through sale of the collateral at    \nfair value less selling costs. Where loans do \nnot exhibit similar risk characteristics, an  \nindividual analysis is performed to consider  \nexpected credit losses. The allowance recorded\nfor individually evaluated loans greater than \n$ 5 million in the commercial lending segment \nis based on an analysis utilizing expected    \ncash flows discounted using the original      \neffective interest rate, the observable market\nprice of the loan, or the fair value of the   \ncollateral, less selling costs, for           \ncollateral-dependent loans as appropriate. For\nsmaller commercial loans collectively         \nevaluated for impairment, historical loss     \nexperience is also incorporated into the      \nallowance methodology applied to this category\nof loans.                                     \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s methodology for determining the \nappropriate allowance for credit losses also  \nconsiders the imprecision inherent in the     \nmethodologies used and allocated to the       \nvarious loan portfolios. As a result, amounts \ndetermined under the methodologies described  \nabove, are adjusted by management to consider \nthe potential impact of other qualitative     \nfactors not captured in the quantitative model\nadjustments which include, but are not limited\nto the following: model imprecision,          \nimprecision in economic scenario assumptions, \nand emerging risks related to either changes  \nin the environment that are affecting specific\nportfolios, or changes in portfolio           \nconcentrations over time that may affect model\nperformance. The consideration of these items \nresults in adjustments to allowance amounts   \nincluded in the Company\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses for each loan portfolio.               \n                                              \nThe Company also assesses the credit risk     \nassociated with off-balance sheet loan        \ncommitments, letters of credit, investment    \nsecurities and derivatives. Credit risk       \nassociated with derivatives is reflected in   \nthe fair values recorded for those positions. \nThe liability for off-balance sheet credit    \nexposure related to loan commitments and other\ncredit guarantees is included in other        \nliabilities. Because business processes and   \ncredit risks associated with unfunded credit  \ncommitments are essentially the same as for   \nloans, the Company utilizes similar processes \nto estimate its liability for unfunded credit \ncommitments.                                  \n                                              \nThe results of the analysis are evaluated     \nquarterly to confirm the

quality of the      \nCompany\u2019s loan portfolios is assessed as a    \nfunction of net credit losses, levels of      \nnonperforming assets and delinquencies, and   \ncredit quality ratings as defined by the      \nCompany .                                     \n                                              \nFor all loan portfolio classes, loans are     \nconsidered past due based on the number of    \ndays delinquent except for monthly amortizing \nloans which are classified delinquent based   \nupon the number of contractually required     \npayments not made (for example, two missed    \npayments is considered 30 days delinquent).   \nWhen a loan is placed on nonaccrual status,   \nunpaid accrued interest is reversed, reducing \ninterest income in the current period.        \n                                              \nCommercial lending segment loans are generally\nplaced on nonaccrual status when the          \ncollection of principal and interest has      \nbecome 90 days past due or is otherwise       \nconsidered doubtful. Commercial lending       \nsegment loans are generally fully charged down\nif unsecured by collateral or partially       \ncharged down to the fair value of the         \ncollateral securing the loan, less costs to   \nsell, when the loan is placed on nonaccrual.  \n                                              \nConsumer lending segment loans are generally  \ncharged-off at a specific number of days or   \npayments past due. Residential mortgages and  \nother retail loans secured by 1-4 family      \nproperties are generally charged down to the  \nfair value of the collateral securing the     \nloan, less costs to sell, at 180 days past    \ndue. Residential mortgage loans and lines in a\nfirst lien position are placed on nonaccrual  \nstatus in instances where a partial charge-off\noccurs unless the loan is well secured and in \nthe process of collection. Residential        \nmortgage loans and lines in a junior lien     \nposition secured by 1-4 family properties are \nplaced on nonaccrual status at 120 days past  \ndue or when they are behind a first lien that \nhas become 180 days or greater past due or    \nplaced on nonaccrual status. Any secured      \nconsumer lending segment loan whose borrower  \nhas had debt discharged through bankruptcy,   \nfor which the loan amount exceeds the fair    \nvalue of the collateral, is charged down to   \nthe fair value of the related collateral and  \nthe remaining balance is placed on nonaccrual \nstatus. Credit card loans continue to accrue  \ninterest until the account is charged-off.    \nCredit cards are charged-off at 180 days past \ndue. Other retail loans not secured by 1-4    \nfamily properties are charged-off at 120 days \npast due; and revolving consumer lines are    \ncharged-off at 180 days past due. Similar to  \ncredit cards, other retail loans are generally\nnot placed on nonaccrual status because of the\nrelative short period of time to charge-off.  \nCertain retail customers having financial     \ndifficulties may have the terms of their      \ncredit card and other loan agreements modified\nto require only principal payments and, as    \nsuch, are reported as nonaccrual.             \n                                              \nFor all loan classes, interest payments       \nreceived on nonaccrual loans are generally    \nrecorded as a reduction to a loan\u2019s carrying  \namount while a loan is on nonaccrual and are  \nrecognized as interest income upon payoff of  \nthe loan. However, interest income may be     \nrecognized for interest payments if the       \nremaining carrying amount of the loan is      \nbelieved to be collectible. In certain        \ncircumstances, loans in any class may be      \nrestored to accrual status, such as when a    \nloan has demonstrated sustained repayment     \nperformance or no amounts are past due and    \nprospects for future payment are no longer in \ndoubt; or when the loan becomes well secured  \nand is in the process of collection. Loans    \nwhere there has been a partial charge-off may \nbe returned to accrual status if all principal\nand interest (including amounts previously    \ncharged-off) is expected to be collected and  \nthe loan is current.                          \n                      \n  46    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a summary of     \nloans by portfolio class, including the       \ndelinquency status of those that continue to  \naccrue interest, and those that are           \nnonperforming:                                \n                                              \n  (\u2026                       90                 \n  in                      Da\u2026                 \n  M\u2026              30-\u2026     or                 \n  M\u2026              Days    Mo\u2026                 \n  3\u2026       Ac\u2026    Past    Pa\u2026    Non\u2026         \n  2\u2026       Cu\u2026     Due    Due     (b)    To\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  C\u2026    $  13\u2026       $      $       $    $1\u2026  \n                   457     72     178         \n  C\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026       54\u2026      74      5     535    55\u2026  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026       11\u2026     148     97     292    11\u2026  \n  (\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026       24\u2026     280    256       1    25\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       52\u2026     254     64     133    52\u2026  \n  r\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026    $  38\u2026    $1,\u2026    $4\u2026    $1,\u2026    $3\u2026  \n  l\u2026                                          \n  D\u2026                                          \n  3\u2026                                          \n  2\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026    $  13\u2026    $350    $94       $    $1\u2026  \n                                  169         \n  C\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026       55\u2026      87      5     338    55\u2026  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026       11\u2026     201     95     325    11\u2026  \n  (\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026       25\u2026     283    231       1    26\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       54\u2026     309     66     139    54\u2026  \n  r\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026    $  38\u2026    $1,\u2026    $4\u2026       $    $3\u2026  \n  l\u2026                              972         \n                                              \n                                              \n       At March\u00a031, 2023, $542million of      \n       loans 30\u201389 days past due and          \n       $2.2billion of loans 90 days or more   \n       past due purchased and that could be   \n       purchased from Government National     \n       Mortgage Association (\u201cGNMA\u201d)          \n       mortgage pools under delinquent loan   \n  (a)  repurchase options whose repayments    \n       are insured by the Federal Housing     \n       Administration or guaranteed by the    \n       United States Department of Veterans   \n       Affairs, were classified as current,   \n       compared with $647million and          \n       $2.2billion at December\u00a031, 2022,      \n       respectively.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Substantially all nonperforming loans  \n       at March\u00a031, 2023 and December\u00a031,     \n       2022, had an associated allowance for  \n  (b)  credit losses.

Commercial and commercial real estate  \nmodifications generally include extensions of \nthe maturity date and may be accompanied by an\nincrease or decrease to the interest rate. In \naddition, the Company may work with the       \nborrower in identifying other changes that    \nmitigate loss to the Company, which may       \ninclude additional collateral or guarantees to\nsupport the loan. To a lesser extent, the     \nCompany may provide an interest rate          \nreduction.                                    \n                                              \nModifications for the consumer lending segment\nare generally part of programs the Company has\ninitiated. The Company modifies residential   \nmortgage loans under Federal Housing          \nAdministration, United States Department of   \nVeterans Affairs, or its own internal         \nprograms. Under these programs, the Company   \noffers qualifying homeowners the opportunity  \nto permanently modify their loan and achieve  \nmore affordable monthly payments. These       \nmodifications may include adjustments to      \ninterest rates, conversion of adjustable rates\nto fixed rates, extension of maturity dates or\ndeferrals of payments, capitalization of      \naccrued interest and/or outstanding advances, \nor in limited situations, partial forgiveness \nof loan principal. In most instances,         \nparticipation in residential mortgage loan    \nmodification programs requires the customer to\ncomplete a short-term trial period. A         \npermanent loan modification is contingent on  \nthe customer successfully completing the trial\nperiod arrangement, and the loan documents are\nnot modified until that time.

                                     \nThe Company transfers financial assets in the \nnormal course of business. The majority of the\nCompany\u2019s financial asset transfers are       \nresidential mortgage loan sales primarily to  \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d),    \ntransfers of tax-advantaged investments,      \ncommercial loan sales through participation   \nagreements, and other individual or portfolio \nloan and securities sales. In accordance with \nthe accounting guidance for asset transfers,  \nthe Company considers any                     \n                      \n  50    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nongoing involvement with transferred assets in\ndetermining whether the assets can be         \nderecognized from the balance sheet.          \nGuarantees provided to certain third parties  \nin connection with the transfer of assets are \nfurther discussed in Note 16.                 \n                                              \nFor loans sold under participation agreements,\nthe Company also considers whether the terms  \nof the loan participation agreement meet the  \naccounting definition of a participating      \ninterest. With the exception of servicing and \ncertain performance-based guarantees, the     \nCompany\u2019s continuing involvement with         \nfinancial assets sold is minimal and generally\nlimited to market customary representation and\nwarranty clauses. Any gain or loss on sale    \ndepends on the previous carrying amount of the\ntransferred financial assets, the             \nconsideration received, and any liabilities   \nincurred in exchange for the transferred      \nassets. Upon transfer, any servicing assets   \nand other interests that continue to be held  \nby the Company are initially recognized at    \nfair value. For further information on        \nmortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d), refer to  \nNote 7. On a limited basis, the Company may   \nacquire and package high-grade corporate bonds\nfor select corporate customers, in which the  \nCompany generally has no continuing           \ninvolvement with these transactions.          \nAdditionally, the Company is an authorized    \nGNMA issuer and issues GNMA securities on a   \nregular basis. The Company has no other asset \nsecuritizations or similar asset-backed       \nfinancing arrangements that are off-balance   \nsheet.                                        \n                                              \nThe Company previously provided financial     \nsupport primarily through the use of waivers  \nof trust and investment management fees       \nassociated with various unconsolidated        \nregistered money market funds it manages. The \nCompany discontinued providing this support   \nbeginning in the third quarter of 2022 due to \nrising interest rates. The Company provided $ \n58 million of support to the funds during the \nthree months ended March 31, 2022.            \n                                              \nThe Company is involved in various entities   \nthat are considered to be variable interest   \nentities (\u201cVIEs\u201d). The Company\u2019s investments  \nin VIEs are primarily related to investments  \npromoting affordable housing, community       \ndevelopment and renewable energy sources. Some\nof these tax-advantaged investments support   \nthe Company\u2019s regulatory compliance with the  \nCommunity Reinvestment Act. The Company\u2019s     \ninvestments in these entities generate a      \nreturn primarily through the realization of   \nfederal and state income tax credits, and     \nother tax benefits, such as tax deductions    \nfrom operating losses of the investments, over\nspecified time periods. These tax credits are \nrecognized as a reduction of tax expense or,  \nfor investments qualifying as investment tax  \ncredits, as a reduction to the related        \ninvestment asset. The Company recognized      \nfederal and state income tax credits related  \nto its affordable housing and other tax-      \nadvantaged investments in tax expense of $ 138\nmillion and $ 113 million for the three months\nended March\u00a031, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  \nThe Company also recognized $ 164 million and \n$ 13 million of investment tax credits for the\nthree months ended March\u00a031, 2023 and 2022,   \nrespectively. The Company recognized $ 130    \nmillion and $ 102 million of expenses related \nto all of these investments for the three     \nmonths ended March\u00a031, 2023 and 2022,         \nrespectively, which were primarily included in\ntax expense.                                  \n                                              \nThe Company is not required to consolidate    \nVIEs in which it has concluded it does not    \nhave a controlling financial interest, and    \nthus is not the primary beneficiary. In such  \ncases, the Company does not have both the     \npower to direct the entities\u2019 most significant\nactivities and the obligation to absorb losses\nor the right to receive benefits that could   \npotentially be significant to the VIEs.       \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s investments in these            \nunconsolidated VIEs are carried in other      \nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The \nCompany\u2019s unfunded capital and other          \ncommitments related to these unconsolidated   \nVIEs are generally carried in other           \nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe Company\u2019s maximum exposure to loss from   \nthese unconsolidated VIEs include the         \ninvestment recorded on the Company\u2019s          \nConsolidated Balance Sheet, net of unfunded   \ncapital commitments, and previously recorded  \ntax credits which remain subject to recapture \nby taxing authorities based on compliance     \nfeatures required to be met at the project    \nlevel. While the Company believes potential   \nlosses from these investments are remote, the \nmaximum exposure was determined by assuming a \nscenario where the community-based business   \nand housing projects completely fail and do   \nnot meet certain government compliance        \nrequirements resulting in recapture of the    \nrelated tax credits.                          \nThe following table provides a summary of     \ninvestments in community development and tax- \nadvantaged VIEs that the Company has not      \nconsolidated:                                 \n                                              \n  (Dollars                          December  \n  in              March\u00a031,              31,  \n  Millions)            2023             2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Investme\u2026                                   \n  carrying     $      5,667    $       5,452  \n  amount                                      \n  Unfunded                                    \n  capital             2,680            2,416  \n  and other                                   \n  commitme\u2026                                   \n  Maximum                                     \n  exposure            9,662            9,761  \n  to loss                                     \n                                              \nThe Company also has noncontrolling financial \ninvestments in private investment funds and   \npartnerships considered to be VIEs, which are \nnot consolidated.

TheCompany also held senior notes of \n$ 3.0billion as available-for-sale investment \nsecurities at March 31, 2023, compared with $ \n3.4billion at December 31, 2022. These senior \nnotes were issued by third-party              \nsecuritization vehicles that held $ 3.5billion\nat March 31, 2023 and $ 4.0billion at December\n31, 2022 of indirect auto loans that          \ncollateralize the senior notes. These VIEs are\nnot consolidated by the Company. The Company\u2019s\nindividual net investments in unconsolidated  \nVIEs, which exclude any unfunded capital      \ncommitments, ranged from less than $ 1million \nto $ 96million at March 31, 2023, compared    \nwith less than $ 1million to $ 116million at  \nDecember 31, 2022. The Company is required to \nconsolidate VIEs in which it has concluded it \nhas a controlling financial interest. The     \nCompany sponsors entities to which it         \ntransfers its interests in tax-advantaged     \ninvestments to third parties. At March 31,    \n2023, approximately $ 6.0billion of the       \nCompany\u2019s assets and $ 4.4billion of its      \nliabilities included on the Consolidated      \nBalance Sheet were related to community       \ndevelopment and tax-advantaged investment VIEs\nwhich the Company has consolidated, primarily \nrelated to these transfers. These amounts     \ncompared to $ 5.9billion and $ 4.2billion,    \nrespectively, at December 31, 2022. The       \nmajority of the assets of these consolidated  \nVIEs are reported in other assets, and the    \nliabilities are reported in long-term debt and\nother liabilities. The assets of a particular \nVIE are the primary source of funds to settle \nits obligations. The creditors of the VIEs do \nnot have recourse to the general credit of the\nCompany. The Company\u2019s exposure to the        \nconsolidated VIEs is generally limited to the \ncarrying value of its variable interests plus \nany related tax credits previously recognized \nor transferred to others with a guarantee. In \naddition, the Company sponsors a municipal    \nbond securities tender option bond program.   \nThe Company controls the activities of the    \nprogram\u2019s entities, is entitled to the        \nresidual returns and provides liquidity and   \nremarketing arrangements to the program. As a \nresult, the Company has consolidated the      \nprogram\u2019s entities. At March 31, 2023, $      \n1.3billion of available-for-sale investment   \nsecurities and $ 1.0billion of short-term     \nborrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet  \nwere related to the tender option bond        \nprogram, compared with $ 1.5billion of        \navailable-for-sale investment securities and $\n1.0billion of short-term borrowings at        \nDecember 31, 2022.                            \n                                       \n  Note\u00a07    Mortgage Servicing Rights  \n                                       \nThe Company capitalizes MSRs as separate      \nassets when loans are sold and servicing is   \nretained. MSRs may also be purchased from     \nothers. The Company carries MSRs at fair      \nvalue, with changes in the fair value recorded\nin earnings during the period in which they   \noccur. The Company serviced $ 245.6 billion of\nresidential mortgage loans for others at      \nMarch\u00a031, 2023, and $ 243.6 billion at        \nDecember\u00a031, 2022, including subserviced      \nmortgages with no corresponding MSR asset.    \nIncluded in mortgage banking revenue are the  \nMSR fair value changes arising from market    \nrate and model assumption changes, net of the \nvalue change in derivatives used to           \neconomically hedge MSRs. These changes        \nresulted in net losses of $ 11 million and $  \n29 million for the three months ended         \nMarch\u00a031, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Loan   \nservicing and ancillary fees, not including   \nvaluation changes, included in mortgage       \nbanking revenue were $ 190 million and $ 185  \nmillion for the three months ended

On  \nan ongoing basis, numerous federal, state,    \nlocal and foreign examinations are in progress\nand cover multiple tax years. As of March\u00a031, \n2023, federal tax examinations for all years  \nending through December\u00a031, 2014 are completed\nand resolved. The Company\u2019s tax returns for   \nthe years ended December\u00a031, 2015 through     \nDecember\u00a031, 2020 are under examination by the\nInternal Revenue Service. The years open to   \nexamination by foreign, state and local       \ngovernment authorities vary by jurisdiction.  \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s net deferred tax asset was $ 6.0\nbillion at March\u00a031, 2023 and $ 6.3 billion at\nDecember\u00a031, 2022.                            \n                                      \n  Note\u00a0\u00a013    Derivative Instruments  \n                                      \nIn the ordinary course of business, the       \nCompany enters into derivative transactions to\nmanage various risks and to accommodate the   \nbusiness requirements of its customers. The   \nCompany recognizes all derivatives on the     \nConsolidated Balance Sheet at fair value in   \nother assets or in other liabilities. On the  \ndate the Company enters into a derivative     \ncontract, the derivative is designated as     \neither a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge,   \nnet investment hedge, or a designation is not \nmade as it is a customer-related transaction, \nan economic hedge for asset/liability risk    \nmanagement purposes or another stand-alone    \nderivative created through the Company\u2019s      \noperations (\u201cfree-standing derivative\u201d). When \na derivative is designated as a fair value,   \ncash flow or net investment hedge, the Company\nperforms an assessment, at inception and, at a\nminimum, quarterly thereafter, to determine   \nthe effectiveness of the derivative in        \noffsetting changes in the value or cash flows \nof the hedged item(s).                        \nFair Value Hedges These derivatives are       \ninterest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge \nthe change in fair value related to interest  \nrate changes of its underlying available-for- \nsale investment securities and fixed-rate     \ndebt. Changes in the fair value of derivatives\ndesignated as fair value hedges, and changes  \nin the fair value of the hedged items, are    \nrecorded in earnings.                         \nCash Flow Hedges These derivatives are        \ninterest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge \nthe forecasted cash flows from its underlying \nvariable-rate loans and debt. Changes in the  \nfair value of derivatives designated as cash  \nflow hedges are recorded in other             \ncomprehensive income (loss) until the cash    \nflows of the hedged items are realized. If a  \nderivative designated as a cash flow hedge is \nterminated or ceases to be highly effective,  \nthe gain or loss in other comprehensive income\n(loss) is amortized to earnings over the      \nperiod the forecasted hedged transactions     \nimpact earnings. If a hedged forecasted       \ntransaction is no longer probable, hedge      \naccounting is ceased and any gain or loss     \nincluded in other comprehensive income (loss) \nis reported in earnings immediately, unless   \nthe forecasted transaction is at least        \nreasonably possible of occurring, whereby the \namounts remain within other comprehensive     \nincome (loss). At March 31, 2023, the Company \nhad $ 43million (net-of-tax) of realized and  \nunrealized gains on derivatives classified as \ncash flow hedges recorded in other            \ncomprehensive income (loss), compared with $  \n114million (net-of-tax) of realized and       \nunrealized losses at December 31, 2022. The   \nestimated amount to be reclassified from other\ncomprehensive income (loss) into earnings     \nduring the next 12 months is a gainof $       \n31million (net-of-tax). All cash flow hedges  \nwere highly effective for the three months    \nended March 31, 2023.                         \nNet Investment Hedges The Company uses forward\ncommitments to sell specified amounts of      \ncertain foreign currencies, and non-derivative\ndebt instruments, to hedge the volatility of  \nits net investment in foreign operations      \ndriven by fluctuations in foreign currency    \nexchange rates. The carrying amount of non-   \nderivative debt instruments designated as net \ninvestment hedges was $ 1.3billion at March   \n31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.               \n                      \n  56    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nOther Derivative Positions The Company enters \ninto free-standing derivatives to mitigate    \ninterest rate risk and for other risk         \nmanagement purposes. These derivatives include\nforward commitments to sell to-be-announced   \nsecurities (\u201cTBAs\u201d) and other commitments to  \nsell residential mortgage loans, which are    \nused to economically hedge the interest rate  \nrisk related to mortgage loans held for sale  \n(\u201cMLHFS\u201d) and unfunded mortgage loan          \ncommitments. The Company also enters into     \ninterest rate swaps, swaptions, forward       \ncommitments to buy TBAs, U.S. Treasury and    \nEurodollar futures and options on U.S.        \nTreasury futures to economically hedge the    \nchange in the fair value of the Company\u2019s     \nMSRs. The Company also enters into foreign    \ncurrency forwards to economically hedge       \nremeasurement gains and losses the Company    \nrecognizes on foreign currency denominated    \nassets and liabilities. In addition, the      \nCompany acts as a seller and buyer of interest\nrate derivatives and foreign exchange         \ncontracts for its customers. The Company      \nmitigates the market and liquidity risk       \nassociated with these customer derivatives by \nentering into similar offsetting positions    \nwith broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis  \nby entering into other derivative or non-     \nderivative financial instruments that         \npartially or fully offset the exposure to     \nearnings from these customer-related          \npositions. The Company\u2019s customer derivatives \nand related hedges are monitored and reviewed \nby the Company\u2019s Market Risk Committee, which \nestablishes policies for market risk          \nmanagement, including exposure limits for each\nportfolio. The Company also has derivative    \ncontracts that are created through its        \noperations, including certain unfunded        \nmortgage loan commitments and swap agreements \nrelated to the sale of a portion of its Class \nB common and preferred shares of Visa Inc.    \nRefer to Note 15 for further information on   \nthese swap agreements.

the         \nderivative contracts. The Company measures    \nthat credit risk using a credit valuation     \nadjustment and includes it within the fair    \nvalue of the derivative. The Company manages  \ncounterparty credit risk through              \ndiversification of its derivative positions   \namong various counterparties, by entering into\nderivative positions that are centrally       \ncleared through clearinghouses, by entering   \ninto master netting arrangements and, where   \npossible, by requiring collateral             \narrangements. A master netting arrangement    \nallows two counterparties, who have multiple  \nderivative contracts with each other, the     \nability to net settle amounts under all       \ncontracts, including any related collateral,  \nthrough a single payment and in a single      \ncurrency. Collateral arrangements generally   \nrequire the counterparty to deliver collateral\n(typically cash or U.S. Treasury and agency   \nsecurities) equal to the Company\u2019s net        \nderivative receivable, subject to minimum     \ntransfer and credit rating requirements.      \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s collateral arrangements are     \npredominately bilateral and, therefore,       \ncontain provisions that require               \ncollateralization of the Company\u2019s net        \nliability derivative positions. Required      \ncollateral coverage is based on net liability \nthresholds and may be contingent upon the     \nCompany\u2019s credit rating from two of the       \nnationally recognized statistical rating      \norganizations. If the Company\u2019s credit rating \nwere to fall below credit ratings thresholds  \nestablished in the collateral arrangements,   \nthe counterparties to the derivatives could   \nrequest immediate additional collateral       \ncoverage up to and including full collateral  \ncoverage for derivatives in a net liability   \nposition. The aggregate fair value of all     \nderivatives under collateral arrangements that\nwere in a net liability position at March\u00a031, \n2023, was $ 2.2 billion. At March\u00a031, 2023,   \nthe Company had $ 1.8 billion of cash posted  \nas collateral against this net liability      \nposition.                                     \n                                              \n             Netting Arrangements for         \n  Note\u00a014    Certain Financial Instruments    \n             and Securities Financing         \n             Activities                       \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s derivative portfolio consists of\nbilateral over-the-counter trades, certain    \ninterest rate derivatives and credit contracts\nrequired to be centrally cleared through      \nclearinghouses per current regulations, and   \nexchange-traded positions which may include   \nU.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures or       \noptions on U.S. Treasury futures.

The Company\u2019s derivative     \ncontracts typically include offsetting rights \n(referred to as netting arrangements), and    \ndepending on expected volume, credit risk, and\ncounterparty preference, collateral           \nmaintenance may be required. For all          \nderivatives under collateral support          \narrangements, fair value is determined daily  \nand, depending on the collateral maintenance  \nrequirements, the Company and a counterparty  \nmay receive or deliver collateral, based upon \nthe net fair value of all derivative positions\nbetween the Company and the counterparty.     \nCollateral is typically cash, but securities  \nmay be allowed under collateral arrangements  \nwith certain counterparties. Receivables and  \npayables related to cash collateral are       \nincluded in other assets and other liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet, along with \nthe related derivative asset and liability    \nfair values. Any securities pledged to        \ncounterparties as collateral remain on the    \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Securities        \nreceived from counterparties as collateral are\nnot recognized on the Consolidated Balance    \nSheet, unless the counterparty defaults. In   \ngeneral, securities used as collateral can be \nsold, repledged or otherwise used by the party\nin possession. No restrictions exist on the   \nuse of cash collateral by either party. Refer \nto Note 13 for further discussion of the      \nCompany\u2019s derivatives, including collateral   \narrangements.                                 \n                                              \nAs part of the Company\u2019s treasury and broker- \ndealer operations, the Company executes       \ntransactions that are treated as securities   \nsold under agreements to repurchase or        \nsecurities purchased under agreements to      \nresell, both of which are accounted for as    \ncollateralized financings. Securities sold    \nunder agreements to repurchase include        \nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned   \ntransactions. Securities purchased under      \nagreements to resell include reverse          \nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed \ntransactions. For securities sold under       \nagreements to repurchase, the Company records \na liability for the cash received, which is   \nincluded in short-term borrowings on the      \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. For securities    \npurchased under agreements to resell, the     \nCompany records a receivable for the cash     \npaid, which is included in other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.                   \n                                              \nSecurities transferred to counterparties under\nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned   \ntransactions continue to be recognized on the \nConsolidated Balance Sheet, are measured at   \nfair value, and are included in investment    \nsecurities or other assets. Securities        \nreceived from counterparties under reverse    \nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed \ntransactions are not recognized on the        \nConsolidated Balance Sheet unless the         \ncounterparty defaults. The securities         \ntransferred under repurchase and reverse      \nrepurchase transactions typically are U.S.    \nTreasury and agency securities, residential   \nagency mortgage-backed securities or corporate\ndebt securities. The securities loaned or     \nborrowed typically are corporate debt         \nsecurities traded by the Company\u2019s broker-    \ndealer subsidiary. In general, the securities \ntransferred can be sold, repledged or         \notherwise used by the party in possession. No \nrestrictions exist on the use of cash         \ncollateral by either party. Repurchase/reverse\nrepurchase and securities loaned/borrowed     \ntransactions expose the Company to            \ncounterparty risk. The Company manages this   \nrisk by performing assessments, independent of\nbusiness line managers, and establishing      \nconcentration limits on each counterparty.    \nAdditionally, these transactions include      \ncollateral arrangements that require the fair \nvalues of the underlying securities to be     \ndetermined daily, resulting in cash being     \nobtained or refunded to counterparties to     \nmaintain specified collateral levels.         \n                      \n  60    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes

Additionally, from time to   \ntime, the Company may be required to record at\nfair value other assets on a nonrecurring     \nbasis, such as loans held for sale, loans held\nfor investment and certain other assets. These\nnonrecurring fair value adjustments typically \ninvolve application of lower-of-cost-or-fair  \nvalue accounting or impairment write-downs of \nindividual assets. Other financial            \ninstruments, such as held-to-maturity         \ninvestment securities, loans, time deposits,  \nshort-term borrowings and long-term debt, are \naccounted for at amortized cost. See \u201cFair    \nValue of Financial Instruments\u201d in this Note  \nfor further information on the estimated fair \nvalue of these other financial instruments. In\naccordance with disclosure guidance, certain  \nfinancial instruments, such as deposits with  \nno defined or contractual maturity,           \nreceivables and payables due in one year or   \nless, insurance contracts and equity          \ninvestments not accounted for at fair value,  \nare excluded from this Note.                  \nFair value is defined as the exchange price   \nthat would be received for an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability (an exit price) in the   \nprincipal or most advantageous market for the \nasset or liability in an orderly transaction  \nbetween market participants on the measurement\ndate. A fair value measurement reflects all of\nthe assumptions that market participants would\nuse in pricing the asset or liability,        \nincluding assumptions about the risk inherent \nin a particular valuation technique, the      \neffect of a restriction on the sale or use of \nan asset and the risk of nonperformance.      \nThe Company groups its assets and liabilities \nmeasured at fair value into a three-level     \nhierarchy for valuation techniques used to    \nmeasure financial assets and financial        \nliabilities at fair value. This hierarchy is  \nbased on whether the valuation inputs are     \nobservable or unobservable. These levels are: \n                                              \n       Level 1 \u2014 Quoted prices in active      \n       markets for identical assets or        \n  \u2022    liabilities. Level 1 includes U.S.     \n       Treasury securities, as well as        \n       exchange-traded instruments.           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Level 2 \u2014 Observable inputs other      \n       than Level 1 prices, such as quoted    \n       prices for similar assets or           \n       liabilities; quoted prices in markets  \n       that are not active; or other inputs   \n       that are observable or can be          \n       corroborated by observable market      \n       data for substantially the full term   \n       of the assets or liabilities. Level 2  \n       includes debt securities that are      \n       traded less frequently than            \n       exchange-traded instruments and which  \n       are typically valued using third       \n  \u2022    party pricing services; derivative     \n       contracts and other assets and         \n       liabilities, including securities,     \n       whose value is determined using a      \n       pricing model with inputs that are     \n       observable in the market or can be     \n       derived principally from or            \n       corroborated by observable market      \n       data; and MLHFS whose values are       \n       determined using quoted prices for     \n       similar assets or pricing models with  \n       inputs that are observable in the      \n       market or can be corroborated by       \n       observable market data.                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Level 3 \u2014 Unobservable inputs that     \n       are supported by little or no market   \n       activity and that are significant to   \n       the fair value of the assets or        \n       liabilities. Level 3 assets and        \n       liabilities include financial          \n       instruments whose values are           \n  \u2022    determined using pricing models,       \n       discounted cash flow methodologies,    \n       or similar techniques, as well as      \n       instruments for which the              \n       determination of fair value requires   \n       significant management judgment or     \n       estimation. This category includes     \n       MSRs and certain derivative            \n       contracts.                             \n                                              \n                      \n  62    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nValuation Methodologies                       \n                                              \nThe valuation methodologies used by the       \nCompany to measure financial assets and       \nliabilities at fair value are described below.\nIn addition, the following section includes an\nindication of the level of the fair value     \nhierarchy in which the assets or liabilities  \nare classified. Where appropriate, the        \ndescriptions include information about the    \nvaluation models and key inputs to those      \nmodels. During the three months ended         \nMarch\u00a031, 2023 and 2022, there were no        \nsignificant changes to the valuation          \ntechniques used by the Company to measure fair\nvalue.                                        \n                                              \nAvailable-For-Sale Investment Securities When \nquoted market prices for identical securities \nare available in an active market, these      \nprices are used to determine fair value and   \nthese securities are classified within Level 1\nof the fair value hierarchy. Level 1          \ninvestment securities include U.S. Treasury   \nand exchange-traded securities.               \n                                              \nFor other securities, quoted market prices may\nnot be readily available for the specific     \nsecurities. When possible, the Company        \ndetermines fair value based on market         \nobservable information, including quoted      \nmarket prices for similar securities, inactive\ntransaction prices, and broker quotes. These  \nsecurities are classified within Level 2 of   \nthe fair value hierarchy. Level 2 valuations  \nare generally provided by a third-party       \npricing service. Level 2 investment securities\nare predominantly agency mortgage-backed      \nsecurities, certain other asset-backed        \nsecurities, obligations of state and political\nsubdivisions and agency debt securities.      \n                                              \nMortgage Loans Held For Sale MLHFS measured at\nfair value, for which an active secondary     \nmarket and readily available market prices    \nexist, are initially valued at the transaction\nprice and are subsequently valued by          \ncomparison to instruments with similar        \ncollateral and risk profiles. MLHFS are       \nclassified within Level 2. Included in        \nmortgage banking revenue were net losses of $ \n3million and $ 234million for the three months\nended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively,  \nfrom the changes to fair value of these MLHFS \nunder fair value option accounting guidance.  \nChanges in fair value due to instrument       \nspecific credit risk were immaterial. Interest\nincome for MLHFS is measured based on         \ncontractual interest rates and reported as    \ninterest income on the Consolidated Statement \nof Income. Electing to measure MLHFS at fair  \nvalue reduces certain timing differences and  \nbetter matches changes in fair value of these \nassets with changes in the value of the       \nderivative instruments used to economically   \nhedge them without the burden of complying    \nwith the requirements for hedge accounting.   \n                                              \nMortgage Servicing Rights MSRs are valued     \nusing a discounted cash flow methodology, and \nare classified within Level 3. The Company    \ndetermines fair value of the MSRs by          \nprojecting future cash flows for different    \ninterest rate scenarios using prepayment rates\nand other assumptions, and discounts these    \ncash flows using a risk adjusted rate based on\noption adjusted spread levels. There is       \nminimal observable market activity for MSRs on\ncomparable portfolios and, therefore, the     \ndetermination of fair value requires          \nsignificant management judgment. Refer to Note\n7 for further information on MSR valuation    \nassumptions.                                  \n                                              \nDerivatives The majority of derivatives held  \nby the Company are executed over-the-counter  \nor centrally cleared through clearinghouses   \nand are valued using market standard cash flow\nvaluation techniques. The models incorporate  \ninputs, depending on the type of derivative,  \nincluding interest rate curves, foreign       \nexchange rates and volatility. All derivative \nvalues incorporate an assessment of the risk  \nof counterparty nonperformance, measured based\non the Company\u2019s evaluation of credit risk    \nincluding external assessments of credit risk.\nThe Company monitors and manages its          \nnonperformance risk by considering its ability\nto net derivative positions under master      \nnetting arrangements, as well as collateral   \nreceived or provided under collateral         \narrangements. Accordingly, the Company has    \nelected to measure the fair value of          \nderivatives, at a counterparty level, on a net\nbasis. The majority of the derivatives are    \nclassified within Level 2 of the fair value   \nhierarchy, as the significant inputs to the   \nmodels, including nonperformance risk, are    \nobservable. However, certain derivative       \ntransactions are with counterparties where    \nrisk of nonperformance cannot be observed in  \nthe market and, therefore, the credit         \nvaluation adjustments result in these         \nderivatives being classified within Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy.                     \n                                              \nThe Company also has other derivative         \ncontracts that are created through its        \noperations, including commitments to purchase \nand originate mortgage loans and swap         \nagreements executed in conjunction with the   \nsale of a portion of its Class B common and   \npreferred shares of Visa Inc. (the \u201cVisa      \nswaps\u201d). The mortgage loan commitments are    \nvalued by pricing models that include market  \nobservable and unobservable inputs, which     \nresult in the commitments being classified    \nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.   \nThe unobservable inputs include assumptions   \nabout the percentage of commitments that      \nactually become a closed loan and the MSR     \nvalue that is inherent in the underlying loan \nvalue.                                        \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    63  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThe Visa swaps require payments by either the \nCompany or the purchaser of the Visa Inc.     \nClass B common and preferred shares when there\nare changes in the conversion rate of the Visa\nInc.

This section includes a        \ndescription of the significant inputs used by \nthe Company and a description of any          \ninterrelationships between these inputs. The  \ndiscussion below excludes nonrecurring fair   \nvalue measurements of collateral value used   \nfor impairment measures for loans and OREO.   \nThese valuations utilize third party appraisal\nor broker price opinions, and are classified  \nas Level 3 due to the significant judgment    \ninvolved.                                     \n                                              \nMortgage Servicing Rights The significant     \nunobservable inputs used in the fair value    \nmeasurement of the Company\u2019s MSRs are expected\nprepayments and the option adjusted spread    \nthat is added to the risk-free rate to        \ndiscount projected cash flows. Significant    \nincreases in either of these inputs in        \nisolation would have resulted in a            \nsignificantly lower fair value measurement.   \nSignificant decreases in either of these      \ninputs in isolation would have resulted in a  \nsignificantly higher fair value measurement.  \nThere is no direct interrelationship between  \nprepayments and option adjusted spread.       \nPrepayment rates generally move in the        \nopposite direction of market interest rates.  \nOption adjusted spread is generally impacted  \nby changes in market return requirements.     \nThe following table shows the significant     \nvaluation assumption ranges for MSRs at       \nMarch\u00a031, 2023:                               \n                                              \n                                   Weigh\u2026     \n          Minim\u2026       Maxi\u2026       Avera\u2026     \n                                      (a)     \n  Exp\u2026         6  %       20  %         9  %  \n  pre\u2026                                        \n  Opt\u2026                                        \n  adj\u2026         5          11            6     \n  spr\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Determined based on the relative fair  \n  (a)  value of the related mortgage loans    \n       serviced.                              \n                                              \nDerivatives The Company has two distinct Level\n3 derivative portfolios: (i) the Company\u2019s    \ncommitments to purchase and originate mortgage\nloans that meet the requirements of a         \nderivative and (ii) the Company\u2019s             \nasset/liability and customer-related          \nderivatives that are Level 3 due to           \nunobservable inputs related to measurement of \nrisk of nonperformance by the counterparty.

Inc. card association \nor its affiliates (collectively \u201cVisa\u201d). In   \n2007, Visa completed a restructuring and      \nissued shares of Visa Inc. common stock to its\nfinancial institution members in contemplation\nof its initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d)        \ncompleted in the first quarter of 2008 (the   \n\u201cVisa Reorganization\u201d). As a part of the Visa \nReorganization, the Company received its      \nproportionate number of shares of Visa Inc.   \ncommon stock, which were subsequently         \nconverted to Class B shares of Visa Inc.      \n(\u201cClass B shares\u201d).                           \nVisa U.S.A. Inc. (\u201cVisa U.S.A.\u201d) and          \nMasterCard International (collectively, the   \n\u201cCard Brands\u201d) are defendants in antitrust    \nlawsuits challenging the practices of the Card\nBrands (the \u201cVisa Litigation\u201d). Visa U.S.A.   \nmember banks have a contingent obligation to  \nindemnify Visa Inc. under the Visa U.S.A.     \nbylaws (which were modified at the time of the\nrestructuring in October 2007) for potential  \nlosses arising from the Visa Litigation. The  \nindemnification by the Visa U.S.A. member     \nbanks has no specific maximum amount. Using   \nproceeds from its IPO and through reductions  \nto the conversion ratio applicable to the     \nClass B shares held by Visa U.S.A. member     \nbanks, Visa Inc. has funded an escrow account \nfor the benefit of member financial           \ninstitutions to fund their indemnification    \nobligations associated with the Visa          \nLitigation. The receivable related to the     \nescrow account is classified in other         \nliabilities as a direct offset to the related \nVisa Litigation contingent liability.         \nIn October 2012, Visa signed a settlement     \nagreement to resolve class action claims      \nassociated with the multidistrict interchange \nlitigation pending in the United States       \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork (the \u201cMulti-District Litigation\u201d). The   \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit  \nreversed the approval of that settlement and  \nremanded the matter to the district court.    \nThereafter, the case was split into two       \nputative class actions, one seeking damages   \n(the \u201cDamages Action\u201d) and a separate class   \naction seeking injunctive relief only (the    \n\u201cInjunctive Action\u201d). In September 2018, Visa \nsigned a new settlement agreement, superseding\nthe original settlement agreement, to resolve \nthe Damages Action. The Damages Action        \nsettlement was approved by the United States  \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork, but is now on appeal. The Injunctive    \nAction, which generally seeks changes to Visa \nrules, is still pending.                      \nOther Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities   \nThe following table is a summary of other     \nguarantees and contingent liabilities of the  \nCompany at March\u00a031, 2023:                    \n                                              \n                                   Maxi\u2026      \n  (D\u2026                              Pote\u2026      \n  in        Coll\u2026       Car\u2026       Futu\u2026      \n  Mi\u2026        Held       Amo\u2026       Paym\u2026      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  St\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026    $      \u2014    $    21    $  10,6\u2026      \n  of                                          \n  cr\u2026                                         \n  Th\u2026                                         \n  pa\u2026           \u2014          \u2014          11      \n  bo\u2026                                         \n  ar\u2026                                         \n  Se\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026       9,778          \u2014       9,679      \n  in\u2026                                         \n  As\u2026           \u2014        100       8,221  -a  \n  sa\u2026                                         \n  Me\u2026         930        134       136,\u2026      \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  Te\u2026                                         \n  op\u2026                                         \n  bo\u2026       1,308          \u2014       1,280      \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  gu\u2026                                         \n  Ot\u2026           \u2014         21       2,005      \n                                              \n                                              \n       The maximum potential future payments  \n       do not include loan sales where the    \n       Company provides standard              \n       representation and warranties to the   \n       buyer against losses related to loan   \n       underwriting documentation defects     \n       that may have existed at the time of   \n       sale that generally are identified     \n       after the occurrence of a triggering   \n       event such as delinquency. For these   \n  (a)  types of loan sales, the maximum       \n       potential future payments is           \n       generally the unpaid principal         \n       balance of loans sold measured at the  \n       end of the current reporting period.   \n       Actual losses will be significantly    \n       less than the maximum exposure, as     \n       only a fraction of loans sold will     \n       have a representation and warranty     \n       breach, and any losses on repurchase   \n       would generally be mitigated by any    \n       collateral held against the loans.     \n                                              \nMerchant Processing The Company, through its  \nsubsidiaries, provides merchant processing    \nservices. Under the rules of credit card      \nassociations, a merchant processor retains a  \ncontingent liability for credit card          \ntransactions processed. This contingent       \nliability arises in the event of a billing    \ndispute between the merchant and a cardholder \nthat is ultimately resolved in the            \ncardholder\u2019s favor. In this situation, the    \ntransaction is \u201ccharged-back\u201d to the merchant \nand the disputed amount is credited or        \notherwise refunded to the cardholder. If the  \nCompany is unable to collect this amount from \nthe merchant, it bears the loss for the amount\nof the refund paid to the cardholder.         \nThe Company currently processes card          \ntransactions in the United States, Canada and \nEurope through wholly-owned subsidiaries. In  \nthe event a merchant was unable to fulfill    \nproduct or services subject to future         \ndelivery, such as airline tickets, the Company\ncould become financially liable for refunding \nthe purchase price of such products or        \nservices purchased through the credit card    \nassociations under the charge-back provisions.\nCharge-back risk related to these merchants is\nevaluated in a manner similar to credit risk  \nassessments and, as such, merchant processing \ncontracts contain various provisions to       \nprotect the Company in the event of default.  \nAt March\u00a031, 2023, the value of airline       \n                      \n  68    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\ntickets purchased to be delivered at a future \ndate through card transactions processed by   \nthe Company was $ 11.2 billion. The Company   \nheld collateral of $ 777 million in escrow    \ndeposits, letters of credit and indemnities   \nfrom financial institutions, and liens on     \nvarious assets. In addition to specific       \ncollateral or other credit enhancements, the  \nCompany maintains a liability for its implied \nguarantees associated with future delivery. At\nMarch\u00a031, 2023, the liability was $ 116       \nmillion primarily related to these airline    \nprocessing arrangements.                      \n                                              \nAsset Sales The Company regularly sells loans \nto GSEs as part of its mortgage banking       \nactivities. The Company provides customary    \nrepresentations and warranties to GSEs in     \nconjunction with these sales. These           \nrepresentations and warranties generally      \nrequire the Company to repurchase assets if it\nis subsequently determined that a loan did not\nmeet specified criteria, such as a            \ndocumentation deficiency or rescission of     \nmortgage insurance. If the Company is unable  \nto cure or refute a repurchase request, the   \nCompany is generally obligated to repurchase  \nthe loan or otherwise reimburse the GSE for   \nlosses. At March 31, 2023, the Company had    \nreserved $ 16million for potential losses from\nrepresentation and warranty obligations,      \ncompared with $ 17million at December 31,     \n2022. The Company\u2019s reserve reflects          \nmanagement\u2019s best estimate of losses for      \nrepresentation and warranty obligations. The  \nCompany\u2019s repurchase reserve is modeled at the\nloan level, taking into consideration the     \nindividual credit quality and borrower        \nactivity that has transpired since            \norigination. The model applies credit quality \nand economic risk factors to derive a         \nprobability of default and potential          \nrepurchase that are based on the Company\u2019s    \nhistorical loss experience, and estimates loss\nseverity based on expected collateral value.  \nThe Company also considers qualitative factors\nthat may result in anticipated losses         \ndiffering from historical loss trends.        \n                                              \nAs of March\u00a031, 2023 and December\u00a031, 2022,   \nthe Company had $ 36 million and $ 39 million,\nrespectively, of unresolved representation and\nwarranty claims from GSEs. The Company does   \nnot have a significant amount of unresolved   \nclaims from investors other than GSEs.        \n                                              \nLitigation and Regulatory Matters             \n                                              \nThe Company is subject to various litigation  \nand regulatory matters that arise in the      \nordinary course of its business. The Company  \nestablishes reserves for such matters when    \npotential losses become probable and can be   \nreasonably estimated. The Company believes the\nultimate resolution of existing legal and     \nregulatory matters will not have a material   \nadverse effect on the financial condition,    \nresults of operations or cash flows of the    \nCompany. However, in light of the             \nuncertainties inherent in these matters, it is\npossible that the ultimate resolution of one  \nor more of these matters may have a material  \nadverse effect on the Company\u2019s results from  \noperations for a particular period, and future\nchanges in circumstances or additional        \ninformation could result in additional        \naccruals or resolution in excess of           \nestablished accruals, which could adversely   \naffect the Company\u2019s results from operations, \npotentially materially.                       \n                                              \nResidential Mortgage-Backed Securities        \nLitigatio n Starting in 2011, the Company and \nother large financial institutions have been  \nsued in their capacity as trustee for         \nresidential mortgage\u2013backed securities trusts \nfor losses arising out of the 2008 financial  \ncrisis. In the lawsuits brought against the   \nCompany, the investors and a monoline insurer \nallege that the Company\u2019s primary banking     \nsubsidiary, U.S. Bank National Association    \n(\u201cUSBNA\u201d), as trustee caused them to incur    \nsubstantial losses by failing to enforce loan \nrepurchase obligations and failing to abide by\nappropriate standards of care after events of \ndefault allegedly occurred. The plaintiffs in \nthese matters seek monetary damages in        \nunspecified amounts and most also seek        \nequitable relief.                             \n                                              \nRegulatory Matters The Company is continually \nsubject to examinations, inquiries and        \ninvestigations in areas of heightened         \nregulatory scrutiny, such as compliance, risk \nmanagement, third-party risk management and   \nconsumer protection. For example, as part of  \nan industry-wide inquiry, the Company\u2019s       \nbroker-dealer and registered investment       \nadvisor subsidiaries received from the        \nSecurities and Exchange Commission a request  \nfor information concerning compliance with    \nrecord retention requirements relating to     \nelectronic business communications. Also, the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) \nhas been investigating the Company\u2019s          \nadministration of unemployment insurance      \nbenefit prepaid debit cards during the        \npandemic timeframe and is considering a       \npotential enforcement action. The Company is  \ncooperating fully with all pending            \nexaminations, inquiries and investigations,   \nany of which could lead to administrative or  \nlegal proceedings or settlements. Remedies in \nthese proceedings or settlements may include  \nfines, penalties, restitution or alterations  \nin the Company\u2019s business practices (which may\nincrease the Company\u2019s operating expenses and \ndecrease its revenue).                        \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    69  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nMUFG Union Bank Consent Order The Company     \nacquired MUB on December 1, 2022. Prior to the\nacquisition, on September 20, 2021, MUB       \nentered into a consent order with the Office  \nof the Comptroller of the Currency (the \u201cOCC\u201d)\nrelating to deficiencies in MUB\u2019s technology  \nand operational risk management (the \u201cMUB     \nConsent Order\u201d). Under the MUB Consent Order, \nthe OCC found MUB to be in noncompliance with \nthe Interagency Guidelines Establishing       \nInformation Security Standards and to have    \nengaged in unsafe and unsound practices       \nregarding technology and operational risk     \nmanagement. The OCC\u2019s conditional approval to \nmerge MUB with and into USBNA (the \u201cBank      \nMerger\u201d) requires USBNA to succeed to the     \nterms and obligations of the MUB Consent Order\nand comply with the other conditions described\ntherein. The Bank Merger is expected to occur \nin connection with the conversion of MUB      \ncustomers and systems to the USBNA platform   \nover Memorial Day weekend in 2023. The        \nCompany\u2019s losses, costs, expenses and damages \nrelating to or resulting from the MUB Consent \nOrder are indemnifiable by the seller, subject\nto the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement  \nfor the MUB acquisition. Outlook Due to their \ncomplex nature, it can be years before        \nlitigation and regulatory matters are         \nresolved. The Company may be unable to develop\nan estimate or range of loss where matters are\nin early stages, there are significant factual\nor legal issues to be resolved, damages are   \nunspecified or uncertain, or there is         \nuncertainty as to a litigation class being    \ncertified or the outcome of pending motions,  \nappeals or proceedings. For those litigation  \nand regulatory matters where the Company has  \ninformation to develop an estimate or range of\nloss, the Company believes the upper end of   \nthe range of reasonably possible losses in    \naggregate, in excess of any reserves          \nestablished for matters where a loss is       \nconsidered probable, will not be material to  \nits financial condition, results of operations\nor cash flows. The Company\u2019s estimates are    \nsubject to significant judgment and           \nuncertainties, and the matters underlying the \nestimates will change from time to time.      \nActual results may vary significantly from the\ncurrent estimates.                            \n                                 \n  Note\u00a0\u00a017    Business Segments  \n                                 \nWithin the Company, financial performance is  \nmeasured by major lines of business based on  \nthe products and services provided to         \ncustomers through its distribution channels.  \nThese operating segments are components of the\nCompany about which financial information is  \nprepared and is evaluated regularly by        \nmanagement in deciding how to allocate        \nresources and assess performance.

The allowance\nfor credit losses and related provision       \nexpense are allocated to the business segments\naccording to the volume and credit quality of \nthe loan balances managed, but with the impact\nof changes in economic forecasts recorded in  \nTreasury and Corporate Support.

Generally,   \nthe determination of the amount of capital    \nallocated to each business segment includes   \ncredit allocations following a Basel III      \nregulatory framework. Interest income and     \nexpense is determined based on the assets and \nliabilities managed by the business segment.  \nBecause funding and asset/liability management\nis a central function, funds transfer-pricing \nmethodologies are utilized to allocate a cost \nof funds used or credit for funds provided to \nall business segment assets and liabilities,  \nrespectively, using a matched funding concept.\nAlso, each business unit is allocated the     \ntaxable-equivalent benefit of tax-exempt      \nproducts. The residual effect on net interest \nincome of asset/liability management          \nactivities is included in Treasury and        \nCorporate Support. Noninterest income and     \nexpenses directly managed by each business    \nsegment, including fees, service charges,     \nsalaries and benefits, and other direct       \nrevenues and costs are accounted for within   \neach segment\u2019s financial results in a manner  \nsimilar to the consolidated financial         \nstatements. Occupancy costs are allocated     \nbased on utilization of facilities by the     \nbusiness segments. Generally, operating losses\nare charged to the business segment when the  \nloss event is realized in a manner similar to \na loan charge-off. Noninterest expenses       \nincurred by centrally managed operations or   \nbusiness segments that directly support       \nanother business segment\u2019s operations are     \ncharged to the applicable business segment    \nbased on its utilization of those services,   \nprimarily measured by the volume of customer  \nactivities, number of employees or other      \nrelevant factors. These allocated expenses are\nreported as net shared services expense within\nnoninterest expense. Certain activities that  \ndo not directly support the operations of the \nbusiness segments or for which the business   \nsegments are not considered financially       \naccountable in evaluating their performance   \nare not charged to the business segments. The \nincome or expenses associated with these      \ncorporate activities, including merger and    \nintegration charges, are reported within the  \nTreasury and Corporate Support business       \nsegment.
