In  \naddition, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s proposed acquisition \nof MUFG Union Bank presents risks and         \nuncertainties, including, among others: the   \nrisk that the cost savings, any revenue       \nsynergies and other anticipated benefits of   \nthe proposed acquisition may not be realized  \nor may take longer than anticipated to be     \nrealized; the risk that U.S. Bancorp\u2019s        \nbusiness could be disrupted as a result of the\nannouncement and pendency of the proposed     \nacquisition and diversion of management\u2019s     \nattention from ongoing business operations and\nopportunities; the possibility that the       \nproposed acquisition, including the           \nintegration of MUFG Union Bank, may be more   \ncostly or difficult to complete than          \nanticipated; delays in closing the proposed   \nacquisition; and the failure of any closing   \nconditions in the definitive purchase         \nagreement to be satisfied.

attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $1.8   \nbillion for the third quarter of 2022, or     \n$1.16 per diluted common share, compared with \n$2.0 billion, or $1.30 per diluted common     \nshare, for the third quarter of 2021. Return  \non average assets and return on average common\nequity were 1.22 percent and 15.8 percent,    \nrespectively, for the third quarter of 2022,  \ncompared with 1.45 percent and 15.9 percent,  \nrespectively, for the third quarter of 2021.  \nThe results for the third quarter of 2022     \nincluded the impact of $42 million ($33       \nmillion net-of-tax)of merger and integration- \nrelated charges associated with the planned   \nacquisition of MUFG Union Bank\u2019s core regional\nbanking franchise from Mitsubishi UFJ         \nFinancial Group, Inc. (\u201cMUFG\u201d), which         \ndecreased diluted earnings per common share by\n$0.02. Total net revenue for the third quarter\nof 2022 was $436 million (7.4 percent) higher \nthan the third quarter of 2021, reflecting a  \n20.7 percent increase in net interest income  \n(20.6 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis)  \nand an 8.3 percent decrease in noninterest    \nincome. The increase in net interest income   \nfrom the third quarter of 2021 was due to the \nimpact of rising interest rates on earning    \nassets and strong growth in average loan and  \ninvestment securities balances, partially     \noffset by deposit pricing, changes in funding \nmix and lower loan fees driven by the impact  \nof loan forgiveness related to the Small      \nBusiness Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) Paycheck      \nProtection Program in the third quarter of    \n2021. The reduction in noninterest income     \nreflected lower mortgage banking revenue      \ndriven by a decline in refinancing activities,\npartially offset by higher trust and          \ninvestment management fees and payment        \nservices revenue. Noninterest expense in the  \nthird quarter of 2022 was $208 million (6.1   \npercent) higher than the third quarter of     \n2021, reflecting increases in compensation    \nexpense, employee benefits expense, marketing \nand business development expense, net         \noccupancy and equipment expense and other     \nnoninterest expense, as well as the impact of \nmerger and integration-related charges of $42 \nmillion. The provision for credit losses for  \nthe third quarter of 2022 was $362 million,   \ncompared with a benefit of $163 million for   \nthe third quarter of 2021. The provision for  \ncredit losses in the third quarter of 2022    \nreflected the impact of strong loan growth and\nincreasing economic uncertainty. The provision\nfor credit losses for the third quarter of    \n2021 reflected a decrease in the allowance for\ncredit losses as a result of improving        \neconomic conditions and credit quality. Net   \ncharge-offs in the third quarter of 2022 were \n$162 million, compared with $147 million in   \nthe third quarter of 2021. Refer to \u201cCorporate\nRisk Profile\u201d for further information on the  \nprovision for credit losses, net charge-offs, \nnonperforming assets and other factors        \nconsidered by the Company in assessing the    \ncredit quality of the loan portfolio and      \nestablishing the allowance for credit losses. \nNet income attributable to U.S. Bancorp for   \nthe first nine months of 2022 was $4.9        \nbillion, or $3.13 per diluted common share,   \ncompared with $6.3 billion, or $4.04 per      \ndiluted common share, for the first nine      \nmonths of 2021. Return on average assets and  \nreturn on average common equity were 1.13     \npercent and 14.1 percent, respectively, for   \nthe first nine months of 2022, compared with  \n1.53 percent and 17.0 percent, respectively,  \nfor the first nine months of 2021. The results\nfor the first nine months of 2022 included the\nimpact of $239 million ($186 million net-of-  \ntax)of merger and integration-related charges,\nwhich decreased diluted earnings per common   \nshare by $0.12. Total net revenue for the     \nfirst nine months of 2022 was $791 million    \n(4.6 percent) higher than the first nine      \nmonths of 2021, reflecting an 11.4 percent    \nincrease in net interest income (11.3 percent \non a taxable-equivalent basis) and a 3.6      \npercent decrease in noninterest income. The   \nincrease in net interest income from the first\nnine months of 2021 was due to the impact of  \nrising interest rates on earning assets and   \nstrong growth in average loan and investment  \nsecurities balances, partially offset by      \ndeposit pricing, changes in funding mix and   \nlower loan fees driven by the impact of loan  \nforgiveness related to the SBA Paycheck       \nProtection Program in the first nine months of\n2021. The reduction in noninterest income     \nreflected lower mortgage banking revenue and  \nother noninterest income, partially offset by \nhigher trust and investment management fees   \nand payment services revenue. Noninterest     \nexpense in the first nine months of 2022 was  \n$668 million (6.6 percent) higher than the    \nfirst nine months of 2021, reflecting         \nincreases in                                  \n                     \n  4    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \ncompensation expense, employee benefits       \nexpense, marketing and business development   \nexpense, net occupancy and equipment expense  \nand other noninterest expense, as well as the \nimpact of merger and integration-related      \ncharges of $239 million. The provision for    \ncredit losses for the first nine months of    \n2022 was $785 million, compared with a benefit\nof $1.2 billion for the first nine months of  \n2021. The provision for credit losses for the \nfirst nine months of 2022 reflected the impact\nof strong loan growth and increasing economic \nuncertainty. The provision for credit losses  \nfor the first nine months of 2021 reflected a \ndecrease in the allowance for credit losses as\na result of improving economic conditions and \ncredit quality.

The transaction is expected to \nclose on December 1, 2022, pending            \nsatisfaction of customary closing conditions. \nSTATEMENT OF INCOME ANALYSIS Net Interest     \nIncome Net interest income, on a taxable-     \nequivalent basis, was $3.9 billion in the     \nthird quarter and $10.5 billion in the first  \nnine months of 2022, representing increases of\n$660 million (20.6 percent) and $1.1 billion  \n(11.3 percent), respectively, compared with   \nthe same periods of 2021. The increases were  \nprimarily due to the impact of rising interest\nrates on earning assets and strong growth in  \nloan and investment securities balances,      \npartially offset by deposit pricing, changes  \nin funding mix, and lower loan fees driven by \nthe impact of loan forgiveness related to the \nSBA Paycheck Protection Program in the first  \nnine months of 2021. Average earning assets   \nfor the third quarter and first nine months of\n2022 were $38.3 billion (7.6 percent) and     \n$35.5 billion (7.1 percent) higher,           \nrespectively, than the same periods of the    \nprior year, reflecting increases in loans and \ninvestment securities, partially offset by    \ndecreases in interest-bearing deposits with   \nbanks. The net interest margin, on a taxable- \nequivalent basis, in the third quarter and    \nfirst nine months of 2022 was 2.83 percent and\n2.62 percent, respectively, compared with 2.53\npercent and 2.52 percent in the third quarter \nand first nine months of 2021, respectively.  \nThe increase in net interest margin from the  \nprior year was primarily due to the impact of \nhigher rates on earning assets, partially     \noffset by deposit pricing and short-term      \nborrowing costs given the rise in short-term  \ninterest rates. Refer to the \u201cConsolidated    \nDaily Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields\nand Rates\u201d table for further information on   \nnet interest income. Average total loans in   \nthe third quarter and first nine months of    \n2022 were $40.0 billion (13.5 percent) and    \n$29.7 billion (10.1 percent) higher,          \nrespectively, than the same periods of 2021.  \nThe increases were primarily due to growth in \ncommercial loans, residential mortgages and   \ncredit card loans. The increase in commercial \nloans was primarily due to higher utilization \ndriven by working capital needs of corporate  \ncustomers, slower payoffs given higher        \nvolatility in the capital markets, as well as \ncore growth, partially offset by expected     \nreductions related to the forgiveness of loans\nin the SBA Paycheck Protection Program. The   \nincrease in residential mortgages was driven  \nby stronger on-balancesheet loan activities   \nand slower refinance activity, while the      \nincrease in credit cards loans was primarily  \ndue to increased consumer spending and account\ngrowth. In addition, other retail loans       \nincreased in the first nine months of 2022,   \ncompared with the first nine months of 2021,  \ndriven by higher auto and recreational vehicle\nloans, partially offset by lower retail       \nleasing balances. Average investment          \nsecurities in the third quarter and first nine\nmonths of 2022 were $13.1 billion (8.6        \npercent) and $17.6 billion (11.5 percent)     \nhigher, respectively, than the same periods of\n2021, primarily due to purchases of mortgage- \nbacked and U.S. Treasury securities, net of   \nprepayments, sales and maturities. Average    \ntotal deposits for the third quarter and first\nnine months of 2022 were $25.3 billion (5.9   \npercent) and $26.8 billion (6.2 percent)      \nhigher, respectively, than the same periods of\n2021. Average total savings deposits for      \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    5  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nthe third quarter and first nine months of    \n2022 were $27.6 billion (9.9 percent) and     \n$26.0 billion (9.3 percent) higher,           \nrespectively, than the same periods of the    \nprior year, driven by increases in Corporate  \nand Commercial Banking, and Consumer and      \nBusiness Banking balances. The increase in    \ntotal savings deposits for the first nine     \nmonths of 2022, compared with the first nine  \nmonths of 2021, was partially offset by a     \ndecrease in Wealth Management and Investment  \nServices balances. Average time deposits for  \nthe third quarter and first nine months of    \n2022 were $12.7 billion (54.0 percent) and    \n$4.2 billion (16.8 percent) higher,           \nrespectively, than the same periods of the    \nprior year, primarily driven by increases in  \nCorporate and Commercial Banking balances,    \npartially offset by decreases in Consumer and \nBusiness Banking balances. Changes in time    \ndeposits are primarily related to those       \ndeposits managed as an alternative to other   \nfunding sources, based largely on relative    \npricing and liquidity characteristics. Average\nnoninterest-bearing deposits for the third    \nquarter and first nine months of 2022 were    \n$15.0 billion (11.6 percent) and $3.4 billion \n(2.7 percent) lower, respectively, than the   \nsame periods of the prior year, driven by     \ndecreases in Corporate and Commercial Banking,\nConsumer and Business Banking, and Payment    \nServices balances. The decrease in average    \nnoninterest-bearing deposits in the first nine\nmonths of 2022, compared with the first nine  \nmonths of 2021, was partially offset by an    \nincrease in Wealth Management and Investment  \nServices balances. Provision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses was $362      \nmillion in the third quarter and $785 million \nin the first nine months of 2022, compared    \nwith a benefit of $163 million and $1.2       \nbillion, respectively, for the same periods of\n2021. The provision for credit losses in the  \nthird quarter and first nine months of 2022   \nreflected the impact of strong loan growth and\nincreasing economic uncertainty. The provision\nfor credit losses in the third quarter and    \nfirst nine months of 2021 reflected the       \nenactment of additional government stimulus   \nprograms and widespread COVID-19vaccine       \navailability, contributing to economic        \nimprovement during the period, which resulted \nin significant decreases in the allowance for \ncredit losses. Net charge-offs increased $15  \nmillion (10.2 percent) in the third quarter of\n2022, compared with the third quarter of 2021,\nreflecting higher commercial, credit card and \nother retail loan net charge-offs, partially  \noffset by a decrease in commercial real estate\nloan charge-offs. Net charge-offs decreased   \n$65 million (11.8 percent) in the first nine  \nmonths of 2022, compared with the first nine  \nmonths of 2021, primarily driven by lower     \ncredit card net charge-offs in the first nine \nmonths of 2022. Refer to \u201cCorporate Risk      \nProfile\u201d for further information on the       \nprovision for credit losses, net charge-offs, \nnonperforming assets and other factors        \nconsidered by the Company in assessing the    \ncredit quality of the loan portfolio and      \nestablishing the allowance for credit losses. \nNoninterest Income Noninterest income was $2.5\nbillion in the third quarter and $7.4 billion \nin the first nine months of 2022, representing\ndecreases of $224 million (8.3 percent) and   \n$280 million (3.6 percent), respectively,     \ncompared with the same periods of 2021. The   \ndecreases from the prior year reflected lower \nmortgage banking revenue, lower deposit       \nservice charges and lower gains on the sale of\nsecurities, partially offset by higher trust  \nand investment management fees and payment    \nservices revenue. Mortgage banking revenue    \ndecreased primarily due to lower application  \nvolume, given declining refinance activities  \nexperienced in the mortgage industry, lower   \nrelated gain on sale margins and lower        \nperforming loan sales. The decrease in        \nmortgage banking revenue in the first nine    \nmonths of 2022, compared with the first nine  \nmonths of 2021, was partially offset by       \nincreases in mortgage servicing rights        \n(\u201cMSRs\u201d) valuations, net of hedging           \nactivities. Deposit service charges decreased \nprimarily due to the impact of the elimination\nof certain consumer non-sufficientfunds fees  \nbeginning in the first quarter of 2022. Trust \nand investment management fees increased      \nprimarily due to lower money market fee       \nwaivers, activity related to the fourth       \nquarter of 2021 acquisition of PFM Asset      \nManagement LLC (\u201cPFM\u201d) and core business      \ngrowth, partially offset by unfavorable market\nconditions. Payment services revenue increased\nas a result of higher corporate payment       \nproducts revenue due to improving business    \nspending across all product groups, as well as\nincreases in merchant processing services     \nrevenue driven by higher sales volume and     \nmerchant fees. The increases in merchant      \nprocessing services revenue were partially    \noffset by the impact of foreign currency rate \nchanges, as the U.S. dollar has strengthened  \nconsiderably compared to European currencies  \ngiven recent uncertainties in Europe. Other   \nnoninterest income decreased in the first nine\nmonths of 2022, compared with the first nine  \nmonths of 2021, primarily due to lower retail \nleasing end-of-termresidual gains.            \n                     \n  6    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                 \n  Table\u00a02    Noninterest Income  \n                                 \n                                              \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      \u2026      $      $      \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2014    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n      $      $      \u2026      $      $      \u2026    \n                                              \nNoninterest Expense Noninterest expense was   \n$3.6 billion in the third quarter and $10.9   \nbillion in the first nine months of 2022,     \nrepresenting increases of $208 million (6.1   \npercent) and $668 million (6.6 percent),      \nrespectively, over the same periods of 2021.  \nThe increases from the prior year reflected   \nhigher compensation expense, employee benefits\nexpense, marketing and business development   \nexpense, net occupancy and equipment expense, \nother noninterest expense and the impact of   \nmerger and integration-related charges        \nassociated with the planned acquisition of    \nMUFG Union Bank. Compensation expense         \nincreased primarily due to merit increases and\nhiring to support business growth, partially  \noffset by lower performance-based incentives  \nand variable compensation. Employee benefits  \nexpense increased primarily driven by higher  \npost-pandemic medical expenses. Marketing and \nbusiness development expense increased due to \nthe timing of marketing campaigns as well as  \nincreased travel and entertainment, while net \noccupancy and equipment expense increased to  \nsupport business growth. Other noninterest    \nexpense increased due to accruals related to  \nfuture delivery exposures for merchant and    \nairline processing as processing volumes      \nrecover, higher Federal Deposit Insurance     \nCorporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) insurance expense driven \nby an increase in the assessment base and     \nrate, and higher other accruals, partially    \noffset by lower other expenses related to the \ndecline in mortgage production.

The increase was driven\nby higher commercial loans, residential       \nmortgages, credit card loans and commercial   \nreal estate loans, partially offset by lower  \nother retail loans. Commercial loans increased\n$19.7 billion (17.6 percent) at September 30, \n2022, compared with December 31, 2021, due to \nhigher utilization driven by working capital  \nneeds of corporate customers and slower       \npayoffs given higher volatility in the capital\nmarkets, as well as core growth. Residential  \nmortgages held in the loan portfolio increased\n$9.8 billion (12.8 percent) at September 30,  \n2022, compared with December 31, 2021, due to \nstronger on-balancesheet loan activities and  \nslower refinance activity. Residential        \nmortgages originated and placed in the        \nCompany\u2019s loan portfolio include jumbo        \nmortgages and branch-originated first lien    \nhome equity loans to borrowers with high      \ncredit quality. Credit card loans increased   \n$2.0 billion (9.1 percent) at September 30,   \n2022, compared with December 31, 2021,        \nreflecting increased consumer spending and    \naccount growth. Commercial real estate loans  \nincreased $1.3 billion (3.3 percent) at       \nSeptember 30, 2022, compared with December 31,\n2021, primarily the result of new             \noriginations. Other retail loans decreased    \n$2.1 billion (3.4 percent) at September 30,   \n2022, compared with December 31, 2021, due to \ndecreases in auto loans and retail leasing    \nbalances, partially offset by an increase in  \nhome equity loans. The Company generally      \nretains portfolio loans through maturity;     \nhowever, the Company\u2019s intent may change over \ntime based upon various factors such as       \nongoing asset/liability management activities,\nassessment of product profitability, credit   \nrisk, liquidity needs, and capital            \nimplications. If the Company\u2019s intent or      \nability to hold an existing portfolio loan    \nchanges, it is transferred to loans held for  \nsale. Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale,\nconsisting primarily of residential mortgages \nto be sold in the secondary market, were $3.6 \nbillion at September 30, 2022, compared with  \n$7.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The        \ndecrease in loans held for sale was           \nprincipally due to a lower level of mortgage  \nloan closings in the third quarter of 2022,   \ncompared with the fourth quarter of 2021.     \nAlmost all of the residential mortgage loans  \nthe Company originates or purchases for sale  \nfollow guidelines that allow the loans to be  \nsold into existing, highly liquid secondary   \nmarkets, in particular in government agency   \ntransactions and to government-sponsored      \nenterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d).                         \n                                    \n  Table\u00a04    Investment Securities  \n                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Information related to asset and       \n       mortgage-backed securities included    \n  (a)  above is presented based upon          \n       weighted-average maturities that take  \n       into account anticipated future        \n       prepayments.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Information related to obligations of  \n       state and political subdivisions is    \n       presented based upon yield to first    \n  (b)  optional call date if the security is  \n       purchased at a premium, and yield to   \n       maturity if the security is purchased  \n       at par or a discount.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Maturity calculations for obligations  \n       of state and political subdivisions    \n       are based on the first optional call   \n  (c)  date for securities with a fair value  \n       above par and the contractual          \n       maturity date for securities with a    \n       fair value equal to or below par.      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Weighted-average yields for            \n       obligations of state and political     \n       subdivisions are presented on a        \n       fully-taxable equivalent basis based   \n       on a federal income tax rate of 21\u00a0    \n  (d)  percent.

The $20.7 billion (11.9 percent)        \ndecrease was primarily due to a $14.1 billion \nunfavorable change in net unrealized gains    \n(losses) on available-for-saleinvestment      \nsecurities and $5.6 billion of net investment \npaydowns, maturities and sales. During the    \nfirst nine months of 2022, the Company        \ntransferred $45.1 billion amortized cost      \n($40.7 billion fair value) of available-for-  \nsaleinvestment securities to the held-to-     \nmaturitycategory to reflect its new intent for\nthese securities. The Company\u2019s available-for-\nsaleinvestment securities are carried at fair \nvalue with changes in fair value reflected in \nother comprehensive income (loss) unless a    \nportion of a security\u2019s unrealized loss is    \nrelated to credit and an allowance for credit \nlosses is necessary. At September 30, 2022,   \nthe Company\u2019s net unrealized losses on        \navailable-for-saleinvestment securities were  \n$9.2 billion, compared with $722 million of   \nnet unrealized gains at December 31, 2021. The\nunfavorable change in net unrealized gains    \n(losses) was primarily due to decreases in the\nfair value of mortgage-backed, U.S. Treasury  \nand state and political securities as a result\nof changes in interest rates, partially offset\nby the impact of the transfer of available-   \nfor-saleinvestment securities to the held-to- \nmaturitycategory. Gross unrealized losses on  \navailable-for-saleinvestment securities       \ntotaled $9.2 billion at September 30, 2022,   \ncompared with $812 million at December 31,    \n2021. At September 30, 2022, the Company had  \nno plans to sell securities with unrealized   \nlosses, and believed it is more likely than   \nnot that it would not be required to sell such\nsecurities before recovery of their amortized \ncost.

Deposits\nTotal deposits were $471.1 billion at         \nSeptember 30, 2022, compared with $456.1      \nbillion at December 31, 2021. The $15.0       \nbillion (3.3 percent) increase in total       \ndeposits reflected increases in time deposits \nand total savings deposits, partially offset  \nby a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits.\nTime deposits increased $19.8 billion (87.3   \npercent) at September 30, 2022, compared with \nDecember 31, 2021, driven by higher Corporate \nand Commercial Banking balances, partially    \noffset by lower Consumer and Business Banking \nbalances. Changes in time deposits are        \nprimarily related to those deposits managed as\nan alternative to other funding sources, based\nlargely on relative pricing and liquidity     \ncharacteristics. Money market deposit balances\nincreased $11.6 billion (9.9 percent) at      \nSeptember 30, 2022, compared with December 31,\n2021, primarily due to higher Wealth          \nManagement and Investment Services, and       \nCorporate and Commercial Banking balances.    \nInterest checking balances increased $2.1     \nbillion (1.8 percent), primarily due to higher\nCorporate and Commercial Banking, and Consumer\nand Business Banking balances, partially      \noffset by lower Wealth Management and         \nInvestment Services balances. Savings account \nbalances increased $1.3 billion (1.9 percent),\ndriven by higher Consumer and Business Banking\nbalances. Noninterest-bearing deposits        \ndecreased $19.7 billion (14.6 percent) at     \nSeptember 30, 2022, compared with December 31,\n2021, primarily due to lower Corporate and    \nCommercial Banking, and Wealth Management and \nInvestment Services balances. Borrowings The  \nCompany utilizes both short-term and long-term\nborrowings as part of its asset/liability     \nmanagement and funding strategies. Short-term \nborrowings, which include federal funds       \npurchased, commercial paper, repurchase       \nagreements, borrowings secured by high-grade  \nassets and other short-term borrowings, were  \n$25.1 billion at September 30, 2022, compared \nwith $11.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The  \n$13.3 billion increase in short-term          \nborrowings was primarily due to increases in  \nshort-term Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d)    \nadvances and commercial paper balances. Long- \nterm debt was $32.2 billion at September 30,  \n2022, compared with $32.1 billion at December \n31, 2021. The $103 million (0.3 percent)      \nincrease was primarily due to $3.9 billion of \nmedium-term note, $1.3 billion of subordinated\nnote and $324 million of bank note issuances, \npartially offset by $2.6 billion of bank note \nrepayments and maturities, $1.3 billion of    \nsubordinated note repayments and $1.0 billion \nof medium-term note repayments.

CORPORATE RISK PROFILE Overview      \nManaging risks is an essential part of        \nsuccessfully operating a financial services   \ncompany. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors has \napproved a risk management framework which    \nestablishes governance and risk management    \nrequirements for all risk-taking activities.  \nThis framework includes Company and business  \nline risk appetite statements which set       \nboundaries for the types and amount of risk   \nthat may be undertaken in pursuing business   \nobjectives and initiatives. The Board of      \nDirectors, primarily through its Risk         \nManagement Committee, oversees performance    \nrelative to the risk management framework,    \nrisk appetite statements, and other policy    \nrequirements.                                 \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    9  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe Executive Risk Committee (\u201cERC\u201d), which is\nchaired by the Chief Risk Officer and includes\nthe Chief Executive Officer and other members \nof the executive management team, oversees    \nexecution against the risk management         \nframework and risk appetite statements. The   \nERC focuses on current and emerging risks,    \nincluding strategic and reputation risks, by  \ndirecting timely and comprehensive actions.   \nSenior operating committees have also been    \nestablished, each responsible for overseeing a\nspecified category of risk. The Company\u2019s most\nprominent risk exposures are credit, interest \nrate, market, liquidity, operational,         \ncompliance, strategic, and reputation. Credit \nrisk is the risk of loss associated with a    \nchange in the credit profile or the failure of\na borrower or counterparty to meet its        \ncontractual obligations. Interest rate risk is\nthe current or prospective risk to earnings   \nand capital, or market valuations, arising    \nfrom the impact of changes in interest rates. \nMarket risk arises from fluctuations in       \ninterest rates, foreign exchange rates, and   \nsecurity prices that may result in changes in \nthe values of financial instruments, such as  \ntrading and available-for-salesecurities,     \nmortgage loans held for sale (\u201cMLHFS\u201d), MSRs  \nand derivatives that are accounted for on a   \nfair value basis. Liquidity risk is the risk  \nthat financial condition or overall safety and\nsoundness is adversely affected by the        \nCompany\u2019s inability, or perceived inability,  \nto meet its cash flow obligations in a timely \nand complete manner in either normal or       \nstressed conditions. Operational risk is the  \nrisk to current or projected financial        \ncondition and resilience arising from         \ninadequate or failed internal processes or    \nsystems, people (including human errors or    \nmisconduct), or adverse external events,      \nincluding the risk of loss resulting from     \nbreaches in data security. Operational risk   \ncan also include the risk of loss due to      \nfailures by third parties with which the      \nCompany does business. Compliance risk is the \nrisk that the Company may suffer legal or     \nregulatory sanctions, financial losses, and   \nreputational damage if it fails to adhere to  \ncompliance requirements and the Company\u2019s     \ncompliance policies. Strategic risk is the    \nrisk to current or projected financial        \ncondition and resilience arising from adverse \nbusiness decisions, poor implementation of    \nbusiness decisions, or lack of responsiveness \nto changes in the banking industry and        \noperating environment. Reputation risk is the \nrisk to current or anticipated earnings,      \ncapital, or franchise or enterprise value     \narising from negative public opinion. This    \nrisk may impair the Company\u2019s competitiveness \nby affecting its ability to establish new     \nrelationships or services, or continue serving\nexisting relationships. In addition to the    \nrisks identified above, other risk factors    \nexist that may impact the Company. Refer to   \n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report \non Form 10-Kfor the year ended December 31,   \n2021, for a detailed discussion of these      \nfactors. The Company\u2019s Board and management-  \nlevel governance committees are supported by a\n\u201cthree lines of defense\u201d model for            \nestablishing effective checks and balances.   \nThe first line of defense, the business lines,\nmanages risks in conformity with established  \nlimits and policy requirements. In turn,      \nbusiness line leaders and their risk officers \nestablish programs to ensure conformity with  \nthese limits and policy requirements. The     \nsecond line of defense, which includes the    \nChief Risk Officer\u2019s organization as well as  \npolicy and oversight activities of corporate  \nsupport functions, translates risk appetite   \nand strategy into actionable risk limits and  \npolicies. The second line of defense monitors \nfirst line of defense conformity with limits  \nand policies, and provides reporting and      \nescalation of emerging risks and other        \nconcerns to senior management and the Risk    \nManagement Committee of the Board of          \nDirectors. The third line of defense, internal\naudit, is responsible for providing the Audit \nCommittee of the Board of Directors and senior\nmanagement with independent assessment and    \nassurance regarding the effectiveness of the  \nCompany\u2019s governance, risk management and     \ncontrol processes. Management regularly       \nprovides reports to the Risk Management       \nCommittee of the Board of Directors. The Risk \nManagement Committee discusses with management\nthe Company\u2019s risk management performance, and\nprovides a summary of key risks to the entire \nBoard of Directors, covering the status of    \nexisting matters, areas of potential future   \nconcern and specific information on certain   \ntypes of loss events. The Risk Management     \nCommittee considers quarterly reports by      \nmanagement assessing the Company\u2019s performance\nrelative to the risk appetite statements and  \nthe associated risk limits, including:        \n                                              \n       Macroeconomic environment and other    \n       qualitative considerations, such as    \n  \u2022    regulatory and compliance changes,     \n       litigation developments, geopolitical  \n       events, and technology and             \n       cybersecurity;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit measures, including adversely   \n  \u2022    rated and nonperforming loans,         \n       leveraged transactions, credit         \n       concentrations and lending limits;     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Interest rate and market risk,         \n  \u2022    including market value and net income  \n       simulation, and trading-related Value  \n       at Risk (\u201cVaR\u201d);                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Liquidity risk, including funding      \n  \u2022    projections under various stressed     \n       scenarios;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       Operational and compliance risk,       \n       including losses stemming from events  \n       such as fraud, processing errors,      \n       control breaches, breaches in data     \n  \u2022    security or adverse business           \n       decisions, as well as reporting on     \n       technology performance, and various    \n       legal and regulatory compliance        \n       measures;                              \n                                              \n                      \n  10    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Capital ratios and projections,        \n  \u2022    including regulatory measures and      \n       stressed scenarios; and                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Strategic and reputation risk          \n  \u2022    considerations, impacts and            \n       responses.                             \n                                              \nCredit Risk Management The Company\u2019s strategy \nfor credit risk management includes well-     \ndefined, centralized credit policies, uniform \nunderwriting criteria, and ongoing risk       \nmonitoring and review processes for all       \ncommercial and consumer credit exposures. In  \nevaluating its credit risk, the Company       \nconsiders changes, if any, in underwriting    \nactivities, the loan portfolio composition    \n(including product mix and geographic,        \nindustry or customer-specific concentrations),\ncollateral values, trends in loan performance \nand macroeconomic factors, such as changes in \nunemployment rates, gross domestic product    \nlevels, inflation, interest rates and consumer\nbankruptcy filings. The Risk Management       \nCommittee oversees the Company\u2019s credit risk  \nmanagement process. In addition, credit       \nquality ratings as defined by the Company are \nan important part of the Company\u2019s overall    \ncredit risk management and evaluation of its  \nallowance for credit losses. Loans with a pass\nrating represent those loans not classified on\nthe Company\u2019s rating scale for problem        \ncredits, as minimal credit risk has been      \nidentified. Loans with a special mention or   \nclassified rating, including consumer lending \nand small business loans that are 90 days or  \nmore past due and still accruing, nonaccrual  \nloans, those loans considered troubled debt   \nrestructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d), and loans in a junior\nlien position that are current but are behind \na first lien position on nonaccrual, encompass\nall loans held by the Company that it         \nconsiders to have a potential or well-defined \nweakness that may put full collection of      \ncontractual cash flows at risk. The Company\u2019s \ninternal credit quality ratings for consumer  \nloans are primarily based on delinquency and  \nnonperforming status, except for a limited    \npopulation of larger loans within those       \nportfolios that are individually evaluated.   \nFor this limited population, the determination\nof the internal credit quality rating may also\nconsider collateral value and customer cash   \nflows. Refer to Note 5 in the Notes to        \nConsolidated Financial Statements for further \ndiscussion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolios   \nincluding internal credit quality ratings. In \naddition, refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion   \nand Analysis \u2014 Credit Risk Management\u201d in the \nCompany\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor the   \nyear ended December 31, 2021, for a more      \ndetailed discussion on credit risk management \nprocesses. The Company manages its credit     \nrisk, in part, through diversification of its \nloan portfolio which is achieved through limit\nsetting by product type criteria, such as     \nindustry, and identification of credit        \nconcentrations. As part of its normal business\nactivities, the Company offers a broad array  \nof lending products. The Company categorizes  \nits loan portfolio into two segments, which is\nthe level at which it develops and documents a\nsystematic methodology to determine the       \nallowance for credit losses. The Company\u2019s two\nloan portfolio segments are commercial lending\nand consumer lending. The commercial lending  \nsegment includes loans and leases made to     \nsmall business, middle market, large          \ncorporate, commercial real estate, financial  \ninstitution, non-profitand public sector      \ncustomers. Key risk characteristics relevant  \nto commercial lending segment loans include   \nthe industry and geography of the borrower\u2019s  \nbusiness, purpose of the loan, repayment      \nsource, borrower\u2019s debt capacity and financial\nflexibility, loan covenants, and nature of    \npledged collateral, if any, as well as        \nmacroeconomic factors such as unemployment    \nrates, gross domestic product levels,         \ncorporate bond spreads and long-term interest \nrates. These risk characteristics, among      \nothers, are considered in determining         \nestimates about the likelihood of default by  \nthe borrowers and the severity of loss in the \nevent of default. The Company considers these \nrisk characteristics in assigning internal    \nrisk ratings to, or forecasting losses on,    \nthese loans, which are the significant factors\nin determining the allowance for credit losses\nfor loans in the commercial lending segment.  \nThe consumer lending segment represents loans \nand leases made to consumer customers,        \nincluding residential mortgages, credit card  \nloans, and other retail loans such as         \nrevolving consumer lines, auto loans and      \nleases, home equity loans and lines, and      \nstudent loans, a run-offportfolio. Home equity\nor second mortgage loans are junior lien      \nclosed-endaccounts fully disbursed at         \norigination. These loans typically are fixed  \nrate loans, secured by residential real       \nestate, with a 10-or 15-yearfixed payment     \namortization schedule. Home equity lines are  \nrevolving accounts giving the borrower the    \nability to draw and repay balances repeatedly,\nup to a maximum commitment, and are secured by\nresidential real estate. These include        \naccounts in either a first or junior lien     \nposition. Typical terms on home equity lines  \nin the portfolio are variable rates           \nbenchmarked to the prime rate, with a 10-or   \n15-yeardraw period during which a minimum     \npayment is equivalent to the monthly interest,\nfollowed by a 20-or 10-yearamortization       \nperiod, respectively. At September 30, 2022,  \nsubstantially all of the Company\u2019s home equity\nlines were in the draw period. Key risk       \ncharacteristics relevant to consumer lending  \nsegment loans primarily relate to the         \nborrowers\u2019 capacity and willingness to repay  \nand include unemployment rates, consumer      \nbankruptcy filings and other macroeconomic    \nfactors, customer payment history             \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    11  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nand credit scores, and in some cases, updated \nloan-to-value(\u201cLTV\u201d) information reflecting   \ncurrent market conditions on real estate-based\nloans. These and other risk characteristics   \nare reflected in forecasts of delinquency     \nlevels, bankruptcies and losses which are the \nprimary factors in determining the allowance  \nfor credit losses for the consumer lending    \nsegment. The Company further disaggregates its\nloan portfolio segments into various classes  \nbased on their underlying risk                \ncharacteristics. The two classes within the   \ncommercial lending segment are commercial     \nloans and commercial real estate loans. The   \nthree classes within the consumer lending     \nsegment are residential mortgages, credit card\nloans and other retail loans. The Company\u2019s   \nconsumer lending segment utilizes several     \ndistinct business processes and channels to   \noriginate consumer credit, including          \ntraditional branch lending, mobile and on-    \nlinebanking, indirect lending, alliance       \npartnerships and correspondent banks. Each    \ndistinct underwriting and origination activity\nmanages unique credit risk characteristics and\nprices its loan production commensurate with  \nthe differing risk profiles. Residential      \nmortgage originations are generally limited to\nprime borrowers and are performed through the \nCompany\u2019s branches, loan production offices,  \nmobile and on-lineservices and a wholesale    \nnetwork of originators. The Company may retain\nresidential mortgage loans it originates on   \nits balance sheet or sell the loans into the  \nsecondary market while retaining the servicing\nrights and customer relationships. Utilizing  \nthe secondary markets enables the Company to  \neffectively reduce its credit and other       \nasset/liability risks. For residential        \nmortgages that are retained in the Company\u2019s  \nportfolio and for home equity and second      \nmortgages, credit risk is also diversified by \ngeography and managed by adherence to LTV and \nborrower credit criteria during the           \nunderwriting process. The Company estimates   \nupdated LTV information on its outstanding    \nresidential mortgages quarterly, based on a   \nmethod that combines automated valuation model\nupdates and relevant home price indices. LTV  \nis the ratio of the loan\u2019s outstanding        \nprincipal balance to the current estimate of  \nproperty value. For home equity and second    \nmortgages, combined loan-to-value(\u201cCLTV\u201d) is  \nthe combination of the first mortgage original\nprincipal balance and the second lien         \noutstanding principal balance, relative to the\ncurrent estimate of property value. Certain   \nloans do not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily   \ndue to lack of availability of relevant       \nautomated valuation model and/or home price   \nindices values, or lack of necessary valuation\ndata on acquired loans. The following tables  \nprovide summary information of residential    \nmortgages and home equity and second mortgages\nby LTV at September 30, 2022:                 \n

     \nRestructured Loans In certain circumstances,  \nthe Company may modify the terms of a loan to \nmaximize the collection of amounts due when a \nborrower is experiencing financial            \ndifficulties or is expected to experience     \ndifficulties in the near-term. In most cases  \nthe modification is either a concessionary    \nreduction in interest rate, extension of the  \nmaturity date or reduction in the principal   \nbalance that would otherwise not be           \nconsidered. Troubled Debt Restructurings      \nConcessionary modifications are classified as \nTDRs unless the modification results in only  \nan insignificant delay in the payments to be  \nreceived. TDRs accrue interest if the borrower\ncomplies with the revised terms and conditions\nand has demonstrated repayment performance at \na level commensurate with the modified terms  \nover several payment cycles, which is         \ngenerally six months or greater. At September \n30, 2022, performing TDRs were $3.2 billion,  \ncompared with $3.1 billion at December 31,    \n2021. The Company continues to work with      \ncustomers to modify loans for borrowers who   \nare experiencing financial difficulties. Many \nof the Company\u2019s TDRs are determined on a     \ncase-by-casebasis in connection with ongoing  \nloan collection processes. The modifications  \nvary within each of the Company\u2019s loan        \nclasses. Commercial lending segment TDRs      \ngenerally include extensions of the maturity  \ndate and may be accompanied by an increase or \ndecrease to the interest rate. The Company may\nalso work with the borrower to make other     \nchanges to the loan to mitigate losses, such  \nas obtaining additional collateral and/or     \nguarantees to support the loan. The Company   \nhas also implemented certain residential      \nmortgage loan restructuring programs that may \nresult in TDRs. The Company modifies          \nresidential mortgage loans under Federal      \nHousing Administration, United States         \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and its own   \ninternal programs. Under these programs, the  \nCompany offers qualifying homeowners the      \nopportunity to permanently modify their loan  \nand achieve more affordable monthly payments  \nby providing loan concessions. These          \nconcessions may include adjustments to        \ninterest rates, conversion of adjustable rates\nto fixed rates, extensions of maturity dates  \nor deferrals of payments, capitalization of   \naccrued interest and/or outstanding advances, \nor in limited situations, partial forgiveness \nof loan principal. In most instances,         \nparticipation in residential mortgage loan    \nrestructuring programs requires the customer  \nto complete a short-term trial period. A      \npermanent loan modification is contingent on  \nthe customer successfully completing the trial\nperiod arrangement, and the loan documents are\nnot modified until that time. The Company     \nreports loans in a trial period arrangement as\nTDRs and continues to report them as TDRs     \nafter the trial period. Credit card and other \nretail loan TDRs are generally part of        \ndistinct restructuring programs providing     \ncustomers modification solutions over a       \nspecified time period, generally up to 60     \nmonths. In accordance with regulatory         \nguidance, the Company considers secured       \nconsumer loans that have had debt discharged  \nthrough bankruptcy where the borrower has not \nreaffirmed the debt to be TDRs. If the loan   \namount exceeds the collateral value, the loan \nis charged down to collateral value and the   \nremaining amount is reported as nonperforming.\nThe following table provides a summary of TDRs\nby loan class, including the delinquency      \nstatus for TDRs that continue to accrue       \ninterest and TDRs included in nonperforming   \nassets:

it does not consider to be \nTDRs, in limited circumstances, to assist     \nborrowers experiencing temporary hardships,   \nincluding previously offering payment relief  \nto borrowers that experienced financial       \nhardship resulting directly from the effects  \nof the COVID-19pandemic. Short-term consumer  \nlending modification programs include payment \nreductions, deferrals of up to three past due \npayments, and the ability to return to current\nstatus if the borrower makes required         \npayments. The Company may also make short-term\nmodifications to commercial lending loans,    \nwith the most common modification being an    \nextension of the maturity date of three months\nor less. Such extensions generally are used   \nwhen the maturity date is imminent and the    \nborrower is experiencing some level of        \nfinancial stress, but the Company believes the\nborrower will pay all contractual amounts     \nowed. Nonperforming Assets The level of       \nnonperforming assets represents another       \nindicator of the potential for future credit  \nlosses. Nonperforming assets include          \nnonaccrual loans, restructured loans not      \nperforming in accordance with modified terms  \nand not accruing interest, restructured loans \nthat have not met the performance period      \nrequired to return to accrual status, other   \nreal estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d) and other          \nnonperforming assets owned by the Company.    \nInterest payments collected from assets on    \nnonaccrual status are generally applied       \nagainst the principal balance and not recorded\nas income. However, interest income may be    \nrecognized for interest payments if the       \nremaining carrying amount of the loan is      \nbelieved to be collectible.

charge-offs were $162 million for the     \nthird quarter of 2022, compared with $147     \nmillion in the third quarter of 2021. The     \nincrease reflected higher commercial, credit  \ncard and other retail loan net charge-offs,   \npartially offset by a decrease in commercial  \nreal estate loan charge-offs. Total loan net  \ncharge-offs were $485 million for the first   \nnine months of 2022, compared with $550       \nmillion in the first nine months of 2021. The \ndecrease was driven by lower credit card net  \ncharge-offs in the first nine months of 2022. \nThe ratio of total loan net charge-offs to    \naverage loans outstanding on an annualized    \nbasis for the third quarter and first nine    \nmonths of 2022 was 0.19 percent and 0.20      \npercent, respectively, compared with 0.20     \npercent and 0.25 percent, respectively, for   \nthe same periods of 2021. Analysis and        \nDetermination of the Allowance for Credit     \nLosses The allowance for credit losses is     \nestablished for current expected credit losses\non the Company\u2019s loan and lease portfolio,    \nincluding unfunded credit commitments. The    \nallowance considers expected losses for the   \nremaining lives of the applicable assets,     \ninclusive of expected recoveries. The         \nallowance for credit losses is increased      \nthrough provisions charged to earnings and    \nreduced by net charge-offs. Management        \nevaluates the appropriateness of the allowance\nfor credit losses on a quarterly basis.       \nMultiple economic scenarios are considered    \nover a three-year reasonable and supportable  \nforecast period, which includes increasing    \nconsideration of historical loss experience   \nover years two and three. These economic      \nscenarios are constructed with interrelated   \nprojections of                                \n                      \n  18    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nmultiple economic variables, and loss         \nestimates are produced that consider the      \nhistorical correlation of those economic      \nvariables with credit losses. After the       \nforecast period, the Company fully reverts to \nlong-term historical loss experience, adjusted\nfor prepayments and characteristics of the    \ncurrent loan and lease portfolio, to estimate \nlosses over the remaining life of the         \nportfolio. The economic scenarios are updated \nat least quarterly and are designed to provide\na range of reasonable estimates from better to\nworse than current expectations. Scenarios are\nweighted based on the Company\u2019s expectation of\neconomic conditions for the foreseeable future\nand reflect significant judgment and          \nconsideration of economic forecast            \nuncertainty. Final loss estimates also        \nconsider factors affecting credit losses not  \nreflected in the scenarios, due to the unique \naspects of current conditions and             \nexpectations. These factors may include, but  \nare not limited to, loan servicing practices, \nregulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and        \nmonetary policy actions. Because business     \nprocesses and credit risks associated with    \nunfunded credit commitments are essentially   \nthe same as for loans, the Company utilizes   \nsimilar processes to estimate its liability   \nfor unfunded credit commitments, which is     \nincluded in other liabilities in the          \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Both the allowance\nfor loan losses and the liability for unfunded\ncredit commitments are included in the        \nCompany\u2019s analysis of credit losses and       \nreported reserve ratios. The allowance        \nrecorded for credit losses utilizes forward-  \nlooking expected loss models to consider a    \nvariety of factors affecting lifetime credit  \nlosses. These factors include, but are not    \nlimited to, macroeconomic variables such as   \nunemployment rates, real estate prices, gross \ndomestic product levels, inflation, interest  \nrates, and corporate bond spreads, as well as \nloan and borrower characteristics, such as    \ninternal risk ratings on commercial loans and \nconsumer credit scores, delinquency status,   \ncollateral type and available valuation       \ninformation, consideration of end-of-         \ntermlosses on lease residuals, and the        \nremaining term of the loan, adjusted for      \nexpected prepayments. For each loan portfolio,\nmodel estimates are adjusted as necessary to  \nconsider any relevant changes in portfolio    \ncomposition, lending policies, underwriting   \nstandards, risk management practices, economic\nconditions or other factors that may affect   \nthe accuracy of the model. Expected credit    \nloss estimates also include consideration of  \nexpected cash recoveries on loans previously  \ncharged-offor expected recoveries on          \ncollateral-dependent loans where recovery is  \nexpected through sale of the collateral. Where\nloans do not exhibit similar risk             \ncharacteristics, an individual analysis is    \nperformed to consider expected credit losses. \nThe allowance recorded for individually       \nevaluated loans greater than $5 million in the\ncommercial lending segment is based on an     \nanalysis utilizing expected cash flows        \ndiscounted using the original effective       \ninterest rate, the observable market price of \nthe loan, or the fair value of the collateral,\nless selling costs, for collateral-dependent  \nloans as appropriate. For commercial TDRs     \nindividually evaluated for impairment,        \nattributes of the borrower are the primary    \nfactors in determining the allowance for      \ncredit losses. For smaller commercial loans   \ncollectively evaluated for impairment,        \nhistorical loss experience is also            \nincorporated into the allowance methodology   \napplied to this category of loans. The        \nallowance recorded for TDR loans in the       \nconsumer lending segment is determined on a   \nhomogenous pool basis utilizing expected cash \nflows discounted using the original effective \ninterest rate of the pool. The expected cash  \nflows on TDR loans consider subsequent payment\ndefaults since modification, the borrower\u2019s   \nability to pay under the restructured terms,  \nand the timing and amount of payments. The    \nallowance for collateral-dependent loans in   \nthe consumer lending segment is determined    \nbased on the current fair value of the        \ncollateral less costs to sell. When evaluating\nthe appropriateness of the allowance for      \ncredit losses for any loans and lines in a    \njunior lien position, the Company considers   \nthe delinquency and modification status of the\nfirst lien. At September 30, 2022, the Company\nserviced the first lien on 34 percent of the  \nhome equity loans and lines in a junior lien  \nposition. The Company also considers the      \nstatus of first lien mortgage accounts        \nreported on customer credit bureau files when \nthe first lien is not serviced by the Company.\nRegardless of whether the Company services the\nfirst lien, an assessment is made of economic \nconditions, problem loans, recent loss        \nexperience and other factors in determining   \nthe allowance for credit losses. Based on the \navailable information, the Company estimated  \n$187 million or 1.6 percent of its total home \nequity portfolio at September 30, 2022,       \nrepresented non-delinquentjunior liens where  \nthe first lien was delinquent or modified. The\nCompany considers historical loss experience  \non the loans and lines in a junior lien       \nposition to establish loss estimates for      \njunior lien loans and lines the Company       \nservices that are current, but the first lien \nis delinquent or modified. The historical     \nlong-term average loss experience related to  \njunior liens has been relatively limited (less\nthan 1 percent of the total portfolio         \nannually), and estimates are adjusted to      \nconsider current collateral support and       \nportfolio risk characteristics. These include \nupdated credit scores and collateral estimates\nobtained on the Company\u2019s home equity         \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    19  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nportfolio each quarter. In its evaluation of  \nthe allowance for credit losses, the Company  \nalso considers the increased risk of loss     \nassociated with home equity lines that are    \ncontractually scheduled to convert from a     \nrevolving status to a fully amortizing        \npayment. When a loan portfolio is purchased,  \nthe acquired loans are divided into those     \nconsidered purchased with more than           \ninsignificant credit deterioration (\u201cPCD\u201d) and\nthose not considered PCD. An allowance is     \nestablished for each population and considers \nproduct mix, risk characteristics of the      \nportfolio, bankruptcy experience, delinquency \nstatus and refreshed LTV ratios when possible.\nThe allowance established for purchased loans \nnot considered PCD is recognized through      \nprovision expense upon acquisition, whereas   \nthe allowance established for loans considered\nPCD at acquisition is offset by an increase in\nthe basis of the acquired loans. Any          \nsubsequent increases and decreases in the     \nallowance related to purchased loans,         \nregardless of PCD status, are recognized      \nthrough provision expense, with charge-offs   \ncharged to the allowance. The Company did not \nhave a material amount of PCD loans included  \nin its loan portfolio at September 30, 2022.  \nThe Company\u2019s methodology for determining the \nappropriate allowance for credit losses also  \nconsiders the imprecision inherent in the     \nmethodologies used and allocated to the       \nvarious loan portfolios. As a result, amounts \ndetermined under the methodologies described  \nabove are adjusted by management to consider  \nthe potential impact of other qualitative     \nfactors not captured in quantitative model    \nadjustments which include, but are not limited\nto, the following: model imprecision,         \nimprecision in economic scenario assumptions, \nand emerging risks related to either changes  \nin the economic environment that are affecting\nspecific portfolios, or changes in portfolio  \nconcentrations over time that may affect model\nperformance. The consideration of these items \nresults in adjustments to allowance amounts   \nincluded in the Company\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses for each loan portfolio. Although the  \nCompany determined the amount of each element \nof the allowance separately and considers this\nprocess to be an important credit management  \ntool, the entire allowance for credit losses  \nis available for the entire loan portfolio.   \nThe actual amount of losses can vary          \nsignificantly from the estimated amounts. At  \nSeptember 30, 2022, the allowance for credit  \nlosses was $6.5 billion (1.88 percent of      \nperiod-endloans), compared with an allowance  \nof $6.2 billion (1.97 percent of period-      \nendloans) at December 31, 2021. The ratio of  \nthe allowance for credit losses to            \nnonperforming loans was 1,025 percent at      \nSeptember 30, 2022, compared with 738 percent \nat December 31, 2021. The ratio of the        \nallowance for credit losses to annualized loan\nnet charge-offs was 1,004 percent at September\n30, 2022, compared with 902 percent of full   \nyear 2021 net charge-offs at December 31,     \n2021. The increase in the allowance for credit\nlosses of $300 million (4.9 percent) at       \nSeptember 30, 2022, compared with December 31,\n2021, was driven by strong loan growth and    \nincreased economic uncertainty. Economic      \nuncertainty and recession risk has been       \nincreasing due to ongoing supply chain        \nchallenges, rising interest rates and         \ninflationary concerns, market volatility,     \nrising energy prices resulting from the       \nRussia-Ukraine conflict and related pressure  \non corporate earnings. In addition to these   \nbroad economic factors, expected loss         \nestimates consider various factors including  \ncustomer specific information impacting       \nchanges in risk ratings, projected            \ndelinquencies, potential effects of           \ninflationary pressures and the impact of      \nrising interest rates on selected borrowers\u2019  \nliquidity and ability to repay. Economic      \nconditions considered in estimating the       \nallowance for credit losses at September 30,  \n2022 included changes in projected gross      \ndomestic product and unemployment levels.     \nThese factors are evaluated through a         \ncombination of quantitative calculations using\neconomic scenarios and qualitative assessments\nthat consider the high degree of economic     \nuncertainty in the current environment.

The Company has       \ncontrols and processes in place for the       \nassessment, identification, monitoring,       \nmanagement and reporting of compliance risks  \nand issues including those created or         \nincreased by economic and financial           \ndisruptions. Refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion\nand Analysis \u2014 Compliance Risk Management\u201d in \nthe Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor   \nthe year ended December 31, 2021, for further \ndiscussion on compliance risk management.     \nInterest Rate Risk Management In the banking  \nindustry, changes in interest rates are a     \nsignificant risk that can impact earnings and \nthe safety and soundness of an entity. The    \nCompany manages its exposure to changes in    \ninterest rates through asset and liability    \nmanagement activities within guidelines       \nestablished by its Asset Liability Management \nCommittee (\u201cALCO\u201d) and approved by the Board  \nof Directors. The ALCO has the responsibility \nfor approving and overseeing compliance with  \nthe ALCO management policies, including       \ninterest rate risk exposure. One way the      \nCompany measures and analyzes its interest    \nrate risk is through net interest income      \nsimulation analysis. Simulation analysis      \nincorporates substantially all of the         \nCompany\u2019s assets and liabilities and off-     \nbalancesheet instruments, together with       \nforecasted changes in the balance sheet and   \nassumptions that reflect the current interest \nrate environment. Through this simulation,    \nmanagement estimates the impact on net        \ninterest income of various interest rate      \nchanges that differ in the direction, amount  \nand speed of change over time, as well as the \nshape of the yield curve. This simulation     \nincludes assumptions about how the balance    \nsheet is likely to be affected by changes in  \nloan and deposit growth. Assumptions are made \nto project interest rates for new loans and   \ndeposits based on historical analysis,        \nmanagement\u2019s outlook and re-pricingstrategies.\nThese assumptions are reviewed and validated  \non a periodic basis with sensitivity analysis \nbeing provided for key variables of the       \nsimulation. The results are reviewed monthly  \nby the ALCO and are used to guide             \nasset/liability management strategies. The    \nCompany manages its interest rate risk        \nposition by holding assets with desired       \ninterest rate risk characteristics on its     \nbalance sheet, implementing certain pricing   \nstrategies for loans and deposits and         \nselecting derivatives and various funding and \ninvestment portfolio strategies. Table 9      \nsummarizes the projected impact to net        \ninterest income over the next 12 months of    \nvarious potential interest rate changes. The  \nsensitivity of the projected impact to net    \ninterest income over the next 12 months is    \ndependent on balance sheet growth, product    \nmix, deposit behavior, pricing and funding    \ndecisions. While the Company utilizes models  \nand assumptions based on historical           \ninformation and expected behaviors, actual    \noutcomes could vary significantly. Net        \ninterest income sensitivities reflect the     \nimpact of current market expectations for     \ninterest rates, driving an increase in        \nbaseline projected net interest income. As    \nmarket expectations are reflected in projected\nresults, incremental interest rate sensitivity\ndeclines on a percentage basis.               \n                      \n  22    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table\u00a09    Sensitivity of Net Interest      \n             Income                           \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  *  Given the level of interest rates,       \n     downward rate scenario is not computed.  \n                                              \nUse of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and\nOther Risks To manage the sensitivity of      \nearnings and capital to interest rate,        \nprepayment, credit, price and foreign currency\nfluctuations (asset and liability management  \npositions), the Company enters into derivative\ntransactions. The Company uses derivatives for\nasset and liability management purposes       \nprimarily in the following ways:              \n                                              \n       To convert fixed-rate debt             \n  \u2022    andavailable-for-saleinvestment        \n       securities from fixed-rate payments    \n       to floating-rate payments;             \n                                              \n                                              \n       To convert floating-rate loans and     \n  \u2022    debt from floating-rate payments to    \n       fixed-rate payments;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate changes in value of the    \n  \u2022    Company\u2019s unfunded mortgage loan       \n       commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs;    \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate remeasurement volatility   \n  \u2022    of foreign currency denominated        \n       balances; and                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate the volatility of the      \n  \u2022    Company\u2019s net investment in foreign    \n       operations driven by fluctuations in   \n       foreign currency exchange rates.       \n                                              \nIn addition, the Company enters into interest \nrate and foreign exchange derivative contracts\nto support the business requirements of its   \ncustomers (customer-related positions). The   \nCompany minimizes the market and liquidity    \nrisks of customer-related positions by either \nentering into similar offsetting positions    \nwith broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis  \nby entering into other derivative or non-     \nderivativefinancial instruments that partially\nor fully offset the exposure from these       \ncustomer-related positions. The Company may   \nenter into derivative contracts that are      \neither exchange-traded, centrally cleared     \nthrough clearinghouses or over-the-counter.The\nCompany does not utilize derivatives for      \nspeculative purposes. The Company does not    \ndesignate all of the derivatives that it      \nenters into for risk management purposes as   \naccounting hedges because of the inefficiency \nof applying the accounting requirements and   \nmay instead elect fair value accounting for   \nthe related hedged items. In particular, the  \nCompany enters into interest rate swaps,      \nswaptions, forward commitments to buy to-be-  \nannouncedsecurities (\u201cTBAs\u201d), U.S. Treasury   \nand Eurodollar futures and options on U.S.    \nTreasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in  \nthe value of its MSRs, but does not designate \nthose derivatives as accounting hedges.       \nAdditionally, the Company uses forward        \ncommitments to sell TBAs and other commitments\nto sell residential mortgage loans at         \nspecified prices to economically hedge the    \ninterest rate risk in its residential mortgage\nloan production activities. At September 30,  \n2022, the Company had $5.3 billion of forward \ncommitments to sell, hedging $2.7 billion of  \nMLHFS and $3.0 billion of unfunded mortgage   \nloan commitments. The forward commitments to  \nsell and the unfunded mortgage loan           \ncommitments on loans intended to be sold are  \nconsidered derivatives under the accounting   \nguidance related to accounting for derivative \ninstruments and hedging activities. The       \nCompany has elected the fair value option for \nthe MLHFS. Derivatives are subject to credit  \nrisk associated with counterparties to the    \ncontracts. Credit risk associated with        \nderivatives is measured by the Company based  \non the probability of counterparty default.   \nThe Company manages the credit risk of its    \nderivative positions by diversifying its      \npositions among various counterparties, by    \nentering into master netting arrangements,    \nand, where possible, by requiring collateral  \narrangements. The Company may also transfer   \ncounterparty credit risk related to interest  \nrate swaps to third parties through the use of\nrisk participation agreements. In addition,   \ncertain interest rate swaps, interest rate    \nforwards and credit contracts are required to \nbe centrally cleared through clearinghouses to\nfurther mitigate counterparty credit risk.

LIBOR Transition In July 2017, the\nUnited Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority  \n(the \u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it would no longer \nrequire banks to submit rates for the London  \nInterBank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) after 2021.  \nIn March 2021, the FCA and the administrator  \nof LIBOR announced that, with respect to the  \nmost commonly used tenors of United States    \nDollar LIBOR, LIBOR will no longer be         \npublished on a representative basis after June\n30, 2023. The publication of all other tenors \nof United States Dollar LIBOR ceased to be    \nprovided or ceased to be representative after \nDecember 31, 2021. The Company holds financial\ninstruments impacted by the discontinuance of \nLIBOR,                                        \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    23  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nincluding certain loans, investment           \nsecurities, derivatives, borrowings and other \nfinancial instruments that use LIBOR as the   \nbenchmark rate. The Company also provides     \nvarious services to customers in its          \ncapacities as trustee and servicer, which     \ninvolve financial instruments that will be    \nsimilarly impacted by the discontinuance of   \nLIBOR. The Company has transitioned financial \ninstruments associated to LIBOR currencies and\ntenors that ceased or became nonrepresentative\non December 31, 2021 to alternative reference \nrates, with limited exceptions. The Company   \nalso anticipates that additional financial    \ninstruments associated to the remaining United\nStates Dollar LIBOR tenors will require       \ntransition to a new reference rate by June 30,\n2023. The Company is currently assessing the  \napplicability and scope of the Adjustable     \nInterest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the \u201cLIBOR Act\u201d),  \nwhich was enacted on March 15, 2022. The LIBOR\nAct establishes a process for replacing LIBOR \non existing LIBOR contracts that do not       \nprovide for the use of a clearly defined or   \npracticable replacement benchmark rate by     \nproviding that a benchmark replacement        \nidentified by the Federal Reserve Board that  \nis based on the Secured Overnight Financing   \nRate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) will replace LIBOR as the       \nbenchmark for such contracts. The final       \nimplementation of the LIBOR Act currently     \nremains uncertain, as the Federal Reserve has \nnot yet issued final regulations that are     \nnecessary for its administration. In order to \nfacilitate the transition process, the Company\nhas instituted a LIBOR Transition Office and  \ncommenced an enterprise-wide project to       \nidentify, assess, monitor and mitigate risks  \nassociated with the expected discontinuance or\nunavailability of LIBOR, actively engage with \nindustry working groups and regulators,       \nachieve operational readiness for the use of  \nalternative reference rates and engage        \nimpacted customers to remediate and transition\nimpacted instruments. The Company has also    \ninvested in updating its systems, models,     \nprocedures and internal infrastructure as part\nof the transition program. Additionally, in   \nalignment with guidance from United States    \nbanking agencies and the FCA, the Company has \nceased the use of LIBOR as a reference rate in\nnew contracts, with limited exceptions, and   \ncontinues to increase the usage of alternative\nreference rates such as SOFR. The Company has \nbeen undergoing an enterprise-wide effort to  \nproactively reprice LIBOR loans with customers\nto an alternative reference rate. The Company \nhas also adopted industry best practice       \nguidelines for fallback language for new      \ntransactions, converted its cleared interest  \nrate swaps discounting to SOFR discounting,   \nand distributed communications related to the \ntransition to certain impacted parties, both  \ninside and outside the Company. Refer to \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on    \nForm 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2021,\nfor further discussion on potential risks that\ncould adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial\nresults as a result of the LIBOR transition.  \nMarket Risk Management In addition to interest\nrate risk, the Company is exposed to other    \nforms of market risk, principally related to  \ntrading activities which support customers\u2019   \nstrategies to manage their own foreign        \ncurrency, interest rate risk and funding      \nactivities. For purposes of its internal      \ncapital adequacy assessment process, the      \nCompany considers risk arising from its       \ntrading activities, as well as the            \nremeasurement volatility of foreign currency  \ndenominated balances included on its          \nConsolidated Balance Sheet (collectively,     \n\u201cCovered Positions\u201d), employing methodologies \nconsistent with the requirements of regulatory\nrules for market risk. The Company\u2019s Market   \nRisk Committee (\u201cMRC\u201d), within the framework  \nof the ALCO, oversees market risk management. \nThe MRC monitors and reviews the Company\u2019s    \nCovered Positions and establishes policies for\nmarket risk management, including exposure    \nlimits for each portfolio. The Company uses a \nVaR approach to measure general market risk.  \nTheoretically, VaR represents the statistical \nrisk of loss the Company has to adverse market\nmovements over a one-daytime horizon. The     \nCompany uses the Historical Simulation method \nto calculate VaR for its Covered Positions    \nmeasured at the ninety-ninth percentile using \na one-yearlook-back period for distributions  \nderived from past market data. The market     \nfactors used in the calculations include those\npertinent to market risks inherent in the     \nunderlying trading portfolios, principally    \nthose that affect the Company\u2019s corporate bond\ntrading business, foreign currency transaction\nbusiness, client derivatives business, loan   \ntrading business and municipal securities     \nbusiness, as well as those inherent in the    \nCompany\u2019s foreign denominated balances and the\nderivatives used to mitigate the related      \nmeasurement volatility. On average, the       \nCompany expects the one-dayVaR to be exceeded \nby actual losses two to three times per year  \nrelated to these positions. The Company       \nmonitors the accuracy of internal VaR models  \nand modeling processes by back-testing model  \nperformance, regularly updating the historical\ndata used by the VaR models and regular model \nvalidations to assess the accuracy of the     \nmodels\u2019 input, processing, and reporting      \ncomponents. All models are required to be     \nindependently reviewed and approved prior to  \nbeing placed in use. If the Company were to   \nexperience market losses in excess of the     \nestimated VaR more often than expected, the   \nVaR models and associated assumptions would be\nanalyzed and adjusted.                        \n                      \n  24    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe average, high, low and period-end one-    \ndayVaR amounts for the Company\u2019s Covered      \nPositions were as follows:                    \n                                              \n  Nine Months Ended                           \n  September\u00a030                                \n  (Dollars in                                 \n  Millions)                  2022       2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Average                 $     2    $     2  \n  High                          4          4  \n  Low                           1          1  \n  Period-end                    3          2  \n                                              \nThe Company did not experience any actual     \nlosses for its combined Covered Positions that\nexceeded VaR during the nine months ended     \nSeptember 30, 2022 and 2021.

The Company engages in various  \nactivities to manage its liquidity risk. These\nactivities include diversifying its funding   \nsources, stress testing, and holding readily- \nmarketable assets which can be used as a      \nsource of liquidity if needed. In addition,   \nthe Company\u2019s profitable operations, sound    \ncredit quality and strong capital position    \nhave enabled it to develop a large and        \nreliable base of core deposit funding within  \nits market areas and in domestic and global   \ncapital markets. The Company\u2019s Board of       \nDirectors approves the Company\u2019s liquidity    \npolicy. The Risk Management Committee of the  \nCompany\u2019s Board of Directors oversees the     \nCompany\u2019s liquidity risk management process   \nand approves a contingency funding plan. The  \nALCO reviews the Company\u2019s liquidity policy   \nand limits, and regularly assesses the        \nCompany\u2019s ability to meet funding requirements\narising from adverse company-specific or      \nmarket events. The Company regularly projects \nits funding needs under various stress        \nscenarios and maintains a contingency funding \nplan consistent with the Company\u2019s access to  \ndiversified sources of contingent funding. The\nCompany maintains a substantial level of total\navailable liquidity in the form of on-        \nbalancesheet and off-balancesheet funding     \nsources. These liquidity sources include cash \nat the Federal Reserve Bank and certain       \nEuropean central banks, unencumbered liquid   \nassets, and capacity to borrow from the FHLB  \nand at the Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s Discount    \nWindow. At September 30, 2022, the fair value \nof unencumbered investment securities totaled \n$128.4 billion, compared with $144.0 billion  \nat December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 4 of the  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements and\n\u201cBalance Sheet Analysis\u201d for further          \ninformation on investment securities          \nmaturities and trends. Asset liquidity is     \nfurther enhanced by the Company\u2019s practice of \npledging loans to access secured borrowing    \nfacilities through the FHLB and Federal       \nReserve Bank. At September 30, 2022, the      \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    25  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCompany could have borrowed a total of an     \nadditional $101.2 billion from the FHLB and   \nFederal Reserve Bank based on collateral      \navailable for additional borrowings. The      \nCompany\u2019s diversified deposit base provides a \nsizeable source of relatively stable and low- \ncostfunding, while reducing the Company\u2019s     \nreliance on the wholesale markets. Total      \ndeposits were $471.1 billion at September 30, \n2022, compared with $456.1 billion at December\n31, 2021. Refer to \u201cBalance Sheet Analysis\u201d   \nfor further information on the Company\u2019s      \ndeposits. Additional funding is provided by   \nlong-term debt and short-term borrowings.     \nLong-term debt was $32.2 billion at September \n30, 2022, and is an important funding source  \nbecause of its multi-year borrowing structure.\nShort-term borrowings were $25.1 billion at   \nSeptember 30, 2022, and supplement the        \nCompany\u2019s other funding sources. Refer to     \n\u201cBalance Sheet Analysis\u201d for further          \ninformation on the Company\u2019s long-term debt   \nand short-term borrowings. In addition to     \nassessing liquidity risk on a consolidated    \nbasis, the Company monitors the parent        \ncompany\u2019s liquidity. The Company establishes  \nlimits for the minimal number of months into  \nthe future where the parent company can meet  \nexisting and forecasted obligations with cash \nand securities held that can be readily       \nmonetized. The Company measures and manages   \nthis limit in both normal and adverse         \nconditions. The Company maintains sufficient  \nfunding to meet expected capital and debt     \nservice obligations for 24 months without the \nsupport of dividends from subsidiaries and    \nassuming access to the wholesale markets is   \nmaintained. The Company maintains sufficient  \nliquidity to meet its capital and debt service\nobligations for 12 months under adverse       \nconditions without the support of dividends   \nfrom subsidiaries or access to the wholesale  \nmarkets. The parent company is currently well \nin excess of required liquidity minimums. At  \nSeptember 30, 2022, parent company long-term  \ndebt outstanding was $20.9 billion, compared  \nwith $18.9 billion at December 31, 2021. The  \nincrease was primarily due to $3.9 billion of \nmedium-term note and $1.3 billion of          \nsubordinated note issuances, partially offset \nby $1.3 billion of subordinated note and $1.0 \nbillion of medium-term note repayments. As of \nSeptember 30, 2022, there was no parent       \ncompany debt scheduled to mature in the       \nremainder of 2022. The Company is subject to a\nregulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d)   \nrequirement which requires banks to maintain  \nan adequate level of unencumbered high quality\nliquid assets to meet estimated liquidity     \nneeds over a 30-daystressed period. At        \nSeptember 30, 2022, the Company was compliant \nwith this requirement. The Company is also    \nsubject to a regulatory Net Stable Funding    \nRatio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) requirement which requires     \nbanks to maintain a minimum level of stable   \nfunding based on the liquidity characteristics\nof their assets, commitments, and derivative  \nexposures over a one-yeartime horizon. At     \nSeptember 30, 2022, the Company was compliant \nwith this requirement. Refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s \nDiscussion and Analysis \u2014 Liquidity Risk      \nManagement\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on \nForm 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2021,\nfor further discussion on liquidity risk      \nmanagement. European Exposures The Company    \nprovides merchant processing and corporate    \ntrust services in Europe either directly or   \nthrough banking affiliations in Europe.       \nRevenue generated from sources in Europe      \nrepresented approximately 2 percent of the    \nCompany\u2019s total net revenue for both the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2022.     \nOperating cash for these businesses is        \ndeposited on a short-term basis typically with\ncertain European central banks. For deposits  \nplaced at other European banks, exposure is   \nmitigated by the Company placing deposits at  \nmultiple banks and managing the amounts on    \ndeposit at any bank based on institution-     \nspecific deposit limits. At September 30,     \n2022, the Company had an aggregate amount on  \ndeposit with European banks of approximately  \n$6.5 billion, predominately with the Central  \nBank of Ireland and Bank of England. In       \naddition, the Company provides financing to   \ndomestic multinational corporations that      \ngenerate revenue from customers in European   \ncountries, transacts with various European    \nbanks as counterparties to certain derivative-\nrelated activities, and through a subsidiary, \nmanages money market funds that hold certain  \ninvestments in European sovereign debt. Any   \ndeterioration in economic conditions in       \nEurope, including the impacts resulting from  \nthe Russia-Ukraine conflict, is not expected  \nto have a significant effect on the Company   \nrelated to these activities.

The Company also manages \nits capital to exceed regulatory capital      \nrequirements for banking organizations. The   \nregulatory capital requirements effective for \nthe Company follow Basel III, with the Company\nbeing subject to calculating its capital      \nadequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted     \nassets under the standardized approach.       \nBeginning in 2022, the Company began to phase \ninto its regulatory capital requirements the  \ncumulative deferred impact of its 2020        \nadoption of the accounting guidance related to\nthe impairment of financial instruments based \non the current expected credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d)\nmethodology plus 25 percent of its quarterly  \ncredit reserve increases over the past two    \nyears. This cumulative deferred impact will be\nphased into the Company\u2019s regulatory capital  \nover the next three years, culminating with a \nfully phased in regulatory capital calculation\nbeginning in 2025. Table 10 provides a summary\nof statutory regulatory capital ratios in     \neffect for the Company at September 30, 2022  \nand December 31, 2021. All regulatory ratios  \nexceeded regulatory \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d        \nrequirements. The Company believes certain    \nother capital ratios are useful in evaluating \nits capital adequacy. The Company\u2019s tangible  \ncommon equity, as a percent of tangible assets\nand as a percent of risk-weighted assets      \ndetermined in accordance with transitional    \nregulatory capital requirements related to the\nCECL methodology under the standardized       \napproach, was 5.2 percent and 6.7 percent,    \nrespectively, at September 30, 2022, compared \nwith 6.8 percent and 9.2 percent,             \nrespectively, at December 31, 2021. In        \naddition, the Company\u2019s common equity tier 1  \ncapital to risk-weighted assets ratio,        \nreflecting the full implementation of the CECL\nmethodology was 9.4 percent at September 30,  \n2022, compared with 9.6 percent at December   \n31, 2021. Refer to \u201cNon-GAAPFinancial         \nMeasures\u201d beginning on page 32 for further    \ninformation on these other capital ratios.    \nTotal U.S. Bancorp shareholders\u2019 equity was   \n$47.5 billion at September 30, 2022, compared \nwith $54.9 billion at December 31, 2021. The  \ndecrease was primarily the result of changes  \nin unrealized gains and losses on available-  \nfor-saleinvestment securities included in     \nother comprehensive income (loss) and         \ndividends paid, partially offset by corporate \nearnings and the issuance of preferred stock. \nThe Company announced on December 22, 2020    \nthat its Board of Directors had approved an   \nauthorization to repurchase $3.0 billion of   \nits common stock beginning January 1, 2021,   \nand repurchased $1.5 billion of its common    \nstock during the first six months of 2021     \nunder this program. The Company suspended all \ncommon stock repurchases at the beginning of  \nthe third quarter of 2021, except for those   \ndone exclusively in connection with its stock-\nbased compensation programs, due to its       \npending acquisition of MUFG Union Bank\u2019s core \nregional banking franchise. The Company\u2019s     \ntarget common equity tier 1 capital ratio is  \n8.5 percent and it expects to operate at a    \ncommon equity tier 1 capital ratio of         \napproximately 8.3 percent at the time of      \nclosing the acquisition, given interest rates \nat the time of the Company\u2019s third quarter    \n2022 earnings release of October 13, 2022. The\nCompany\u2019s common equity tier 1 capital ratio  \nis expected to increase toward 9.0 percent    \nsubsequent to the acquisition as a result of  \ncorporate earnings, which will include the    \nimpact of accretion of the purchase accounting\nvaluation adjustments. The Company does not   \nexpect to commence repurchasing its common    \nstock until after the acquisition closes and  \nits common equity tier 1 capital ratio        \napproximates 9.0 percent.

LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL REVIEW \nThe Company\u2019s major lines of business are     \nCorporate and Commercial Banking, Consumer and\nBusiness Banking, Wealth Management and       \nInvestment Services, Payment Services, and    \nTreasury and Corporate Support. These         \noperating segments are components of the      \nCompany about which financial information is  \nprepared and is evaluated regularly by        \nmanagement in deciding how to allocate        \nresources and assess performance. Basis for   \nFinancial Presentation Business line results  \nare derived from the Company\u2019s business unit  \nprofitability reporting systems by            \nspecifically attributing managed balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and    \ntheir related income or expense. Refer to Note\n17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial     \nStatements for further information on the     \nbusiness lines\u2019 basis for financial           \npresentation. Designations, assignments and   \nallocations change from time to time as       \nmanagement systems are enhanced, methods of   \nevaluating performance or product lines change\nor business segments are realigned to better  \nrespond to the Company\u2019s diverse customer     \nbase. During 2022, certain organization and   \nmethodology changes were made and,            \naccordingly, 2021 results were restated and   \npresented on a comparable basis. Corporate and\nCommercial Banking Corporate and Commercial   \nBanking offers lending, equipment finance and \nsmall-ticket leasing, depository services,    \ntreasury management, capital markets services,\ninternational trade services and other        \nfinancial services to middle market, large    \ncorporate, commercial real estate, financial  \ninstitution, non-profitand public sector      \nclients. Corporate and Commercial Banking     \ncontributed $502 million of the Company\u2019s net \nincome in the third quarter and $1.3 billion  \nin the first nine months of 2022, or increases\nof $121 million (31.8 percent) and $39 million\n(3.1 percent), respectively, compared with the\nsame periods of 2021. Net revenue increased   \n$235 million (24.6 percent) in the third      \nquarter and $303 million (10.3 percent) in the\nfirst nine months of 2022, compared with the  \nsame periods of 2021. Net interest income, on \na taxable-equivalent basis, increased $233    \nmillion (33.2 percent) in the third quarter   \nand $317 million (14.7 percent) in the first  \nnine months of 2022, compared with the same   \nperiods of 2021. The increases were primarily \ndue to higher loan and interest-bearing       \ndeposit balances and the impact of higher     \nrates on the margin benefit from deposits,    \npartially offset by lower spreads on loans and\nlower noninterest-bearing deposits.           \nNoninterest income increased $2 million (0.8  \npercent) in the third quarter of 2022,        \ncompared with the third quarter of 2021,      \nprimarily due to stronger trust and investment\nmanagement fees driven by lower money market  \nfee waivers and core growth, and higher       \ncommercial products revenue due to higher     \ncapital markets revenue, partially offset by  \nlower treasury management fees driven by the  \nimpact of rising interest rates on earnings   \ncredits. Noninterest income decreased $14     \nmillion (1.8 percent) in the first nine months\nof 2022, compared with the first nine months  \nof 2021, primarily due to lower corporate bond\nfees within the capital markets business,     \npartially offset by higher treasury management\nfees. Noninterest expense increased $17       \nmillion (3.9 percent) in the third quarter and\n$47 million (3.6 percent) in the first nine   \nmonths of 2022, compared with the same periods\nof 2021, primarily due to higher FDIC         \ninsurance expense and higher compensation     \nexpense primarily due to merit increases and  \nhiring to support business growth. The        \nincrease in noninterest expense for the first \nnine months of 2022, compared with the first  \nnine months of 2021, was partially offset by  \nlower performance-based incentives related to \ncapital markets activity. The provision for   \ncredit losses increased $56 million in the    \nthird quarter and $204 million in the first   \nnine months of 2022, compared with the same   \nperiods of 2021, primarily due to

The decrease in        \nmortgage banking revenue in the first nine    \nmonths of 2022, compared with the first nine  \nmonths of 2021, was partially offset by an    \nincrease in the fair value of MSRs, net of    \nhedging activities.

Noninterest expense       \ndecreased $13 million (0.9 percent) in the    \nthird quarter of 2022, compared with the third\nquarter of 2021, due to lower compensation    \nexpense reflecting lower revenue-related      \ncompensation due to mortgage production and   \nlower mortgage related loan expense, partially\noffset by increases in net shared services    \nexpense due to investments in digital         \ncapabilities. Noninterest expense increased   \n$86 million (2.1 percent) in the first nine   \nmonths of 2022, compared with the first nine  \nmonths of 2021, primarily due to increases in \nnet shared services expense, partially offset \nby lower compensation expense and mortgage    \nrelated loan expense. The provision for credit\nlosses increased $67 million in the third     \nquarter and $148 million in the first nine    \nmonths of 2022, compared with the same periods\nof 2021, due to loan balance growth and more  \nfavorable credit trends in the prior year.    \nWealth Management and Investment Services     \nWealth Management and Investment Services     \nprovides private banking, financial advisory  \nservices, investment management, retail       \nbrokerage services, insurance, trust, custody \nand fund servicing through four businesses:   \nWealth Management, Global Corporate Trust &   \nCustody, U.S. Bancorp Asset Management and    \nFund Services.

Net revenue increased $335   \nmillion (42.2 percent) in the third quarter   \nand $616 million (25.8 percent) in the first  \nnine months of 2022, compared with the same   \nperiods of 2021. Net interest income, on a    \ntaxable-equivalent basis, increased $241      \nmillion in the third quarter and $355 million \n(47.2 percent) in the first nine months of    \n2022, compared with the same periods of 2021, \nprimarily due to the favorable impact of      \nhigher rates on the margin benefit from       \ndeposits. Noninterest income increased $94    \nmillion (16.8 percent) in the third quarter   \nand $261 million (15.9 percent) in the first  \nnine months of 2022, compared with the same   \nperiods of 2021, primarily driven by higher   \ntrust and investment management fees          \nreflecting lower money market fund fee        \nwaivers, the impact of the PFM acquisition and\ncore business growth, partially offset by the \nimpact of unfavorable market conditions.      \nNoninterest expense increased $72 million     \n(13.8 percent) in the third quarter and $229  \nmillion (14.9 percent) in the first nine      \nmonths of 2022, compared with the same periods\nof 2021, reflecting higher compensation       \nexpense as a result of merit increases, the   \nPFM acquisition, core business growth and     \nperformance-based incentives, as well as      \nhigher net shared services expense driven by  \ninvestment in support of business growth. The \nprovision for credit losses increased $1      \nmillion (50.0 percent) in the third quarter   \nand $5 million in the first nine months of    \n2022, compared with the same periods of 2021. \nPayment Services Payment Services includes    \nconsumer and business credit cards, stored-   \nvalue cards, debit cards, corporate,          \ngovernment and purchasing card services,      \nconsumer lines of credit and merchant         \nprocessing. Payment Services contributed $330 \nmillion of the Company\u2019s net income in the    \nthird quarter and $1.1 billion in the first   \nnine months of 2022, or decreases of $70      \nmillion (17.5 percent) and $245 million (18.4 \npercent), respectively, compared with the same\nperiods of 2021. Net revenue increased $60    \nmillion (3.8 percent) in the third quarter and\n$231 million (5.2 percent) in the first nine  \nmonths of 2022, compared with the same periods\nof 2021. Noninterest income increased $49     \nmillion (5.2 percent) in the third quarter and\n$203 million (7.7 percent) in the first nine  \nmonths of 2022, compared with the same periods\nof 2021, mainly due to continued strengthening\nof consumer and business spending across most \nsectors. As a result, there was strong growth \nin corporate payment products revenue driven  \nby improving business spending across all     \nproduct                                       \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    31  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \ngroups. In addition, merchant processing      \nservices revenue increased due to higher sales\nvolume and higher merchant fees, partially    \noffset by the impact of foreign currency rate \nchanges in Europe. Credit and debit card      \nrevenue was negatively impacted by declining  \nprepaid processing fees as the beneficial     \nimpact of government stimulus programs        \ndissipated year-over-year, offset by strong   \nsales. Net interest income, on a taxable-     \nequivalent basis, increased $11 million (1.8  \npercent) in the third quarter and $28 million \n(1.5 percent) in the first nine months of     \n2022, compared with the same periods of 2021, \nprimarily due to higher loan balances and loan\nfees, partially offset by higher funding      \ncosts. Net interest income further increased  \nin the third quarter of 2022, compared with   \nthe third quarter of 2021, due to higher loan \nyields driven by higher interest rates net of \nlower customer revolve rates. Noninterest     \nexpense increased $35 million (4.1 percent) in\nthe third quarter and $138 million (5.5       \npercent) in the first nine months of 2022,    \ncompared with the same periods of 2021,       \nreflecting higher net shared services expense \ndriven by investment in infrastructure and    \ntechnology development, in addition to higher \ncompensation expense as a result of merit     \nincreases, core business growth and variable  \ncompensation. The provision for credit losses \nincreased $119 million (71.7 percent) in the  \nthird quarter and $420 million in the first   \nnine months of 2022, compared with the same   \nperiods of 2021, primarily due to the impacts \nof increasing delinquency rates, along with   \nstronger growth in loan balances. Treasury and\nCorporate Support Treasury and Corporate      \nSupport includes the Company\u2019s investment     \nportfolios, funding, capital management,      \ninterest rate risk management, income taxes   \nnot allocated to the business lines, including\nmost investments in tax-advantagedprojects,   \nand the residual aggregate of those expenses  \nassociated with corporate activities that are \nmanaged on a consolidated basis. Treasury and \nCorporate Support recorded net income of $113 \nmillion in the third quarter and $246 million \nin the first nine months of 2022, compared    \nwith net income of $378 million and $1.2      \nbillion in the same periods of 2021,          \nrespectively. Net revenue increased $16       \nmillion (5.2 percent) in the third quarter and\n$110 million (13.3 percent) in the first nine \nmonths of 2022, compared with the same periods\nof 2021. Net interest income, on a taxable-   \nequivalent basis, increased $7 million (8.1   \npercent) in the third quarter and $116 million\n(96.7 percent) in the first nine months of    \n2022, compared with the same periods of 2021, \nprimarily due to higher yields on the         \ninvestment securities portfolio and interest- \nbearing deposits with banks, mostly offset by \nhigher funding costs. Noninterest income      \nincreased $9 million (4.1 percent) in the     \nthird quarter of 2022, compared with the third\nquarter of 2021, primarily due to higher tax- \nadvantagedinvestment syndication revenue and  \ngains on the sale of certain assets, partially\noffset by lower securities gains. Noninterest \nincome decreased $6 million (0.8 percent) in  \nthe first nine months of 2022, compared with  \nthe first nine months of 2021, primarily due  \nto lower securities gains, partially offset by\nhigher tax-advantagedinvestment syndication   \nrevenue, gains on the sale of certain assets, \nand higher commercial products revenue.       \nNoninterest expense increased $97 million     \n(48.5 percent) in the third quarter and $168  \nmillion (22.9 percent) in the first nine      \nmonths of 2022, compared with the same periods\nof 2021, primarily due to merger and          \nintegration-related charges associated with   \nthe planned acquisition of MUFG Union Bank and\nhigher compensation expense reflecting merit  \nincreases, hiring to support business growth  \nand core business growth net of lower variable\ncompensation, partially offset by lower net   \nshared services expense. The provision for    \ncredit losses increased $282 million (89.2    \npercent) in the third quarter and $1.2 billion\n(96.5 percent) in the first nine months of    \n2022, compared with the same periods of 2021, \nreflecting the increase in the allowance for  \ncredit losses due to increasing economic      \nuncertainty in the current year, compared to  \nthe reduction in the allowance for credit     \nlosses associated with improving economic     \nconditions in the prior year. Income taxes are\nassessed to each line of business at a        \nmanagerial tax rate of 25.0 percent with the  \nresidual tax expense or benefit to arrive at  \nthe consolidated effective tax rate included  \nin Treasury and Corporate Support. NON-       \nGAAPFINANCIAL MEASURES In addition to capital \nratios defined by banking regulators, the     \nCompany considers various other measures when \nevaluating capital utilization and adequacy,  \nincluding:                                    \n                                              \n  \u2022    Tangible common equity to tangible     \n       assets,                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Tangible common equity to              \n       risk-weighted assets, and              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Common equity tier\u00a01 capital to        \n  \u2022    risk-weighted assets, reflecting the   \n       full implementation of the CECL        \n       methodology.                           \n                                              \nThese capital measures are viewed by          \nmanagement as useful additional methods of    \nevaluating the Company\u2019s utilization of its   \ncapital held and the level of capital         \navailable to withstand unexpected negative    \nmarket or economic conditions. Additionally,  \npresentation of these measures allows         \ninvestors, analysts                           \n                      \n  32    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nand banking regulators to assess the Company\u2019s\ncapital position relative to other financial  \nservices companies. These capital measures are\nnot defined in generally accepted accounting  \nprinciples (\u201cGAAP\u201d), or are not currently     \neffective or defined in banking regulations.  \nIn addition, certain of these measures differ \nfrom currently effective capital ratios       \ndefined by banking regulations principally in \nthat the currently effective ratios, which are\nsubject to certain transitional provisions,   \ntemporarily exclude the impact of the 2020    \nadoption of accounting guidance related to    \nimpairment of financial instruments based on  \nthe CECL methodology. As a result, these      \ncapital measures disclosed by the Company may \nbe considered non-GAAPfinancial measures.     \nManagement believes this information helps    \ninvestors assess trends in the Company\u2019s      \ncapital adequacy. The Company also discloses  \nnet interest income and related ratios and    \nanalysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which \nmay also be considered non-GAAPfinancial      \nmeasures. The Company believes this           \npresentation to be the preferred industry     \nmeasurement of net interest income as it      \nprovides a relevant comparison of net interest\nincome arising from taxable and tax-          \nexemptsources. In addition, certain           \nperformance measures, including the efficiency\nratio and net interest margin utilize net     \ninterest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.\nThere may be limits in the usefulness of these\nmeasures to investors. As a result, the       \nCompany encourages readers to consider the    \nconsolidated financial statements and other   \nfinancial information contained in this report\nin their entirety, and not to rely on any     \nsingle financial measure.

principles generally accepted \nin the United States and conform to general   \npractices within the banking industry. The    \npreparation of financial statements in        \nconformity with GAAP requires management to   \nmake estimates and assumptions. The Company\u2019s \nfinancial position and results of operations  \ncan be affected by these estimates and        \nassumptions, which are integral to            \nunderstanding the Company\u2019s financial         \nstatements. Critical accounting policies are  \nthose policies management believes are the    \nmost important to the portrayal of the        \nCompany\u2019s financial condition and results, and\nrequire management to make estimates that are \ndifficult, subjective or complex. Most        \naccounting policies are not considered by     \nmanagement to be critical accounting policies.\nManagement has discussed the development and  \nthe selection of critical accounting policies \nwith the Company\u2019s Audit Committee. Those     \npolicies considered to be critical accounting \npolicies relate to the allowance for credit   \nlosses, fair value estimates, MSRs, and income\ntaxes. These accounting policies are discussed\nin detail in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and     \nAnalysis \u2014 Critical Accounting Policies\u201d and  \nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor\nthe year ended December 31, 2021. CONTROLS AND\nPROCEDURES Under the supervision and with the \nparticipation of the Company\u2019s management,    \nincluding its principal executive officer and \nprincipal financial officer, the Company has  \nevaluated the effectiveness of the design and \noperation of its disclosure controls and      \nprocedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)and  \n15d-15(e)under the Securities Exchange Act of \n1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)). Based upon this   \nevaluation, the principal executive officer   \nand principal financial officer have concluded\nthat, as of the end of the period covered by  \nthis report, the Company\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures were effective. During the most\nrecently completed fiscal quarter, there was  \nno change made in the Company\u2019s internal      \ncontrol over financial reporting (as defined  \nin Rules 13a-15(f)and 15d-15(f)under the      \nExchange Act) that has materially affected, or\nis reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial     \nreporting.

\ntherefore, do not include all information and \nnotes necessary for a complete presentation of\nfinancial position, results of operations and \ncash flow activity required in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in   \nthe United States. In the opinion of          \nmanagement of U.S. Bancorp (the \u201cCompany\u201d),   \nall adjustments (consisting only of normal    \nrecurring adjustments) necessary for a fair   \nstatement of results for the interim periods  \nhave been made. These financial statements and\nnotes should be read in conjunction with the  \nconsolidated financial statements and notes   \nincluded in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on    \nForm 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been    \nreclassified to conform to the current period \npresentation.                                 \n                                \n  Note\u00a02    Accounting Changes  \n                                \nReference Interest Rate Transition In March   \n2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(\u201cFASB\u201d) issued accounting guidance, providing\ntemporary optional expedients and exceptions  \nto the guidance in United States generally    \naccepted accounting principles on contract    \nmodifications and hedge accounting, to ease   \nthe financial reporting burdens related to the\nexpected market transition from the London    \nInterbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and other    \ninterbank offered rates to alternative        \nreference rates. Under the guidance, a company\ncan elect not to apply certain modification   \naccounting requirements to contracts affected \nby reference rate transition, if certain      \ncriteria are met. A company that makes this   \nelection would not be required to remeasure   \nthe contracts at the modification date or     \nreassess a previous accounting determination. \nThis guidance also permits a company to elect \nvarious optional expedients that would allow  \nit to continue applying hedge accounting for  \nhedging relationships affected by reference   \nrate transition, if certain criteria are met. \nThe guidance is effective upon issuance and   \ngenerally can be applied through December 31, \n2022. The Company is in the process of        \nevaluating and applying, as applicable, the   \noptional expedients and exceptions in         \naccounting for eligible contract              \nmodifications, eligible existing hedging      \nrelationships and new hedging relationships   \navailable through December 31, 2022. The      \nadoption of this guidance has not had, and is \nexpected to continue to not have, a material  \nimpact on the Company\u2019s financial statements. \nFair Value Hedging \u2013 Portfolio Layer Method In\nMarch 2022, the FASB issued accounting        \nguidance, effective for the Company no later  \nthan January 1, 2023, related to fair value   \nhedge accounting of portfolios of financial   \nassets. This guidance expands the current     \nlast-of-layerhedging method that permits a    \ncompany to apply fair value hedging to a      \nstated amount of a closed portfolio of        \nprepayable financial assets, by allowing it to\ndesignate multiple hedging relationships on a \nsingle closed portfolio, resulting in a larger\nportion of the interest rate risk associated  \nwith such a portfolio being eligible to be    \nhedged. The guidance also expands the scope of\nthe method to include non-prepayablefinancial \nassets and clarifies other technical questions\nfrom the original accounting guidance. The    \nCompany expects the adoption of this guidance \nwill not be material to its financial         \nstatements.                                   \nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Troubled Debt         \nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures In     \nMarch 2022, the FASB issued accounting        \nguidance, effective for the Company no later  \nthan January 1, 2023, related to the          \nrecognition and measurement of troubled debt  \nrestructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d) by creditors. This    \nguidance removes the separate recognition and \nmeasurement requirements for TDRs by replacing\nthem with a requirement for a company to apply\nexisting accounting guidance to determine     \nwhether a modification results in a new loan  \nor a continuation of an existing loan. This   \nguidance also replaces existing TDR           \ndisclosures with similar but more expansive   \ndisclosures for certain modifications of      \nreceivables made to borrowers experiencing    \nfinancial difficulty. Further, this guidance  \nalso requires companies to disclose current-  \nperiod gross write-offs by year of origination\nfor financing receivables. The guidance can be\nadopted on a prospective or modified          \nretrospective basis. The Company expects the  \nadoption of this guidance will not be material\nto its financial sta tements.                 \n                      \n  40    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\n                                    \n  Note\u00a0\u00a03    Business Combinations  \n                                    \nIn September 2021, the Company announced that \nit entered into a definitive agreement to     \nacquire MUFG Union Bank\u2019s core regional       \nbanking franchise from Mitsubishi UFJ         \nFinancial Group, Inc.

MUFG Union Bank has             \napproximately 300 branches in California,     \nWashington and Oregon and is expected to add  \napproximately $ 105 billion in total assets, $\n58 billion of loans and $ 90 billion of       \ndeposits to the Company\u2019s consolidated balance\nsheet. On October 19, 2022, the Company       \nannounced that all required regulatory        \napprovals to complete the transaction have    \nbeen received. The transaction is expected to \nclose on December 1, 2022, pending            \nsatisfaction of customary closing conditions. \n                                    \n  Note\u00a0\u00a04    Investment Securities  \n                                    \nThe Company\u2019s held-to-maturity investment     \nsecurities are carried at historical cost,    \nadjusted for amortization of premiums and     \naccretion of discounts.

If the Company    \nintends to sell or it is more likely than not \nthe Company will be required to sell an       \ninvestment security, the amortized cost of the\nsecurity is written down to fair value.

The Company measures the   \nallowance for credit losses using market      \ninformation where available and discounting   \nthe cash flows at the original effective rate \nof the investment security. The allowance for \ncredit losses is adjusted each period through \nearnings and can be subsequently recovered.   \nThe allowance for credit losses on the        \nCompany\u2019s available-for-sale investment       \nsecurities was immaterial at September\u00a030,    \n2022 and December\u00a031, 2021.                   \n                                              \nAt September 30, 2022, certain investment     \nsecurities had a fair value below amortized   \ncost. The following table shows the gross     \nunrealized losses and fair value of the       \nCompany\u2019s available-for-saleinvestment        \nsecurities with unrealized losses, aggregated \nby investment category and length of time the \nindividual investment securities have been in \ncontinuous unrealized loss positions, at      \nSeptember 30, 2022:                           \n                                              \n                                         \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2013    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \nThese unrealized losses primarily relate to   \nchanges in interest rates and market spreads  \nsubsequent to purchase of these available-for-\nsaleinvestment securities. U.S. Treasury and  \nagencies securities and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities are issued, guaranteed or otherwise\nsupported by the United States government. The\nCompany\u2019s obligations of state and political  \nsubdivisions are generally high grade.        \nAccordingly, the Company does not consider    \nthese unrealized losses to be credit-related  \nand an allowance for credit losses is not     \nnecessary. In general, the issuers of the     \ninvestment securities are contractually       \nprohibited from prepayment at less than par,  \nand the Company did not pay significant       \npurchase premiums for these investment        \nsecurities. At September 30, 2022, the Company\nhad no plans to sell investment securities    \nwith unrealized losses, and believes it is    \nmore likely than not it would not be required \nto sell such investment securities before     \nrecovery of their amortized cost. During the  \nnine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021,\nthe Company did not purchase any investment   \nsecurities that had more-than-insignificant   \ncredit deterioration. All of the Company\u2019s    \nheld-to-maturityinvestment securities are U.S.\nTreasury and agencies securities andhighly    \nrated agency mortgage-backed securities that  \nare guaranteed or otherwise supported by the  \nUnited States government and have no history  \nof credit losses. Accordingly the Company does\nnot expect to incur any credit losses on held-\nto-maturityinvestment securities and has      \nnoallowance for credit losses recorded for    \nthese securities.

Net unearned interest   \nand deferred fees and costs amounted to $ 331 \nmillion at September\u00a030, 2022 and $ 475       \nmillion at December\u00a031, 2021. All purchased   \nloans are recorded at fair value at the date  \nof purchase. The Company evaluates purchased  \nloans for more-than-insignificant             \ndeterioration at the date of purchase in      \naccordance with applicable authoritative      \naccounting guidance. Purchased loans that have\nexperienced more-than-insignificant           \ndeterioration from origination are considered \npurchased credit deteriorated loans. All other\npurchased loans are considered non-purchased  \ncredit deteriorated loans.                    \nAllowance for Credit Losses The allowance for \ncredit losses is established for current      \nexpected credit losses on the Company\u2019s loan  \nand lease portfolio, including unfunded credit\ncommitments. The allowance considers expected \nlosses for the remaining lives of the         \napplicable assets, inclusive of expected      \nrecoveries. The allowance for credit losses is\nincreased through provisions charged to       \nearnings and reduced by net charge-offs.      \nManagement evaluates the appropriateness of   \nthe allowance for credit losses on a quarterly\nbasis.                                        \nMultiple economic scenarios are considered    \nover a three-year reasonable and supportable  \nforecast period, which includes increasing    \nconsideration of historical loss experience   \nover years two and three. These economic      \nscenarios are constructed with interrelated   \nprojections of multiple economic variables,   \nand loss estimates are produced that consider \nthe historical correlation of those economic  \nvariables with credit losses. After the       \nforecast period, the Company fully reverts to \nlong-term historical loss experience, adjusted\nfor prepayments and characteristics of the    \ncurrent loan and lease portfolio, to estimate \nlosses over the remaining life of the         \nportfolio. The economic scenarios are updated \nat least quarterly and are designed to provide\na range of reasonable estimates, from better  \nto worse than current expectations. Scenarios \nare weighted based on the Company\u2019s           \nexpectation of economic conditions for the    \nforeseeable future and reflect significant    \njudgment and consideration of economic        \nforecast uncertainty. Final loss estimates    \nalso consider factors affecting credit losses \nnot reflected in the scenarios, due to the    \nunique aspects of current conditions and      \nexpectations. These factors may include, but  \nare not limited to, loan servicing practices, \nregulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and        \nmonetary policy actions.                      \nThe allowance recorded for credit losses      \nutilizes forward-looking expected loss models \nto consider a variety of factors affecting    \nlifetime credit losses. These factors include,\nbut are not limited to, macroeconomic         \nvariables such as                             \n                      \n  44    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nunemployment rates, real estate prices, gross \ndomestic product levels , inflation, interest \nratesand corporate bonds spreads, as well as  \nloan and borrower characteristics, such as    \ninternal risk ratings on commercial loans and \nconsumer credit scores, delinquency status,   \ncollateral type and available valuation       \ninformation, consideration of end-of-         \ntermlosses on lease residuals, and the        \nremaining term of the loan, adjusted for      \nexpected prepayments. For each loan portfolio,\nmodel estimates are adjusted as necessary to  \nconsider any relevant changes in portfolio    \ncomposition, lending policies, underwriting   \nstandards, risk management practices, economic\nconditions or other factors that would affect \nthe accuracy of the model. Expected credit    \nloss estimates also include consideration of  \nexpected cash recoveries on loans previously  \ncharged-offor expected recoveries on          \ncollateral dependent loans where recovery is  \nexpected through sale of the collateral. Where\nloans do not exhibit similar risk             \ncharacteristics, an individual analysis is    \nperformed to consider expected credit losses. \nThe allowance recorded for individually       \nevaluated loans greater than $ 5million in the\ncommercial lending segment is based on an     \nanalysis utilizing expected cash flows        \ndiscounted using the original effective       \ninterest rate, the observable market price of \nthe loan, or the fair value of the collateral,\nless selling costs, for collateral-dependent  \nloans as appropriate. The allowance recorded  \nfor Troubled Debt Restructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d) loans \nin the consumer lending segment is determined \non a homogenous pool basis utilizing expected \ncash flows discounted using the original      \neffective interest rate of the pool. The      \nexpected cash flows on TDR loans consider     \nsubsequent payment defaults since             \nmodification, the borrower\u2019s ability to pay   \nunder the restructured terms, and the timing  \nand amount of payments. The allowance for     \ncollateral-dependent loans in the consumer    \nlending segment is determined based on the    \nfair value of the collateral less costs to    \nsell. For commercial TDRs individually        \nevaluated for impairment, attributes of the   \nborrower are the primary factors in           \ndetermining the allowance for credit losses.  \nFor smaller commercial loans collectively     \nevaluated for impairment, historical loss     \nexperience is also incorporated into the      \nallowance methodology applied to this category\nof loans. The Company\u2019s methodology for       \ndetermining the appropriate allowance for     \ncredit losses also considers the imprecision  \ninherent in the methodologies used and        \nallocated to the various loan portfolios. As a\nresult, amounts determined under the          \nmethodologies described above, are adjusted by\nmanagement to consider the potential impact of\nother qualitative factors not captured in the \nquantitative model adjustments which include, \nbut are not limited to the following: model   \nimprecision, imprecision in economic scenario \nassumptions, and emerging risks related to    \neither changes in the environment that are    \naffecting specific portfolios, or changes in  \nportfolio concentrations over time that may   \naffect model performance. The consideration of\nthese items results in adjustments to         \nallowance amounts included in the Company\u2019s   \nallowance for credit losses for each loan     \nportfolio. The Company also assesses the      \ncredit risk associated with off-balancesheet  \nloan commitments, letters of credit,          \ninvestment securities and derivatives. Credit \nrisk associated with derivatives is reflected \nin the fair values recorded for those         \npositions. The liability for off-balancesheet \ncredit exposure related to loan commitments   \nand other credit guarantees is included in    \nother liabilities. Because business processes \nand credit risks associated with unfunded     \ncredit commitments are essentially the same as\nfor loans, the Company utilizes similar       \nprocesses to estimate its liability for       \nunfunded credit commitments. The results of   \nthe analysis are evaluated quarterly to       \nconfirm the estimates are appropriate for each\nspecific loan portfolio, as well as the entire\nloan portfolio, as the entire allowance for   \ncredit losses is available for the entire loan\nportfolio.                                    \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    45  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nActivity in the allowance for credit losses by\nportfolio class was as follows:               \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026                                \n                                              \n      \u2026      $      \u2026      \u2026      $      \u2026    \n             \u2026                    \u2026           \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2013      2      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      $      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026                                \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      3      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      3      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026                                \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      $      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026           \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      9      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      $      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026                                \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      6      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \nThe increase in the allowance for credit      \nlosses from December\u00a031, 2021 to September\u00a030,\n2022 reflected strong loan growth and         \nincreased economic uncertainty.               \n                                              \nCredit Quality The credit quality of the      \nCompany\u2019s loan portfolios is assessed as a    \nfunction of net credit losses, levels of      \nnonperforming assets and delinquencies, and   \ncredit quality ratings as defined by the      \nCompany.                                      \n                                              \nFor all loan portfolio classes, loans are     \nconsidered past due based on the number of    \ndays delinquent except for monthly amortizing \nloans which are classified delinquent based   \nupon the number of contractually required     \npayments not made (for example, two missed    \npayments is considered 30 days delinquent).   \nWhen a loan is placed on nonaccrual status,   \nunpaid accrued interest is reversed, reducing \ninterest income in the current period.        \n                                              \nCommercial lending segment loans are generally\nplaced on nonaccrual status when the          \ncollection of principal and interest has      \nbecome 90 days past due or is otherwise       \nconsidered doubtful. Commercial lending       \nsegment loans are generally fully charged down\nif unsecured by collateral or partially       \ncharged down to the fair value of the         \ncollateral securing the loan, less costs to   \nsell, when the loan is placed on nonaccrual.  \n                                              \nConsumer lending segment loans are generally  \ncharged-off at a specific number of days or   \npayments past due. Residential mortgages and  \nother retail loans secured by 1-4 family      \nproperties are generally charged down to the  \nfair value of the collateral securing the     \nloan, less costs to sell, at 180 days past    \ndue. Residential mortgage loans and lines in a\nfirst lien position are placed on nonaccrual  \nstatus in instances where a partial charge-off\noccurs unless the loan is well                \n                      \n  46    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nsecured and in the process of collection.     \nResidential mortgage loans and lines in a     \njunior lien position secured by 1-4 family    \nproperties are placed on nonaccrual status at \n120 days past due or when they are behind a   \nfirst lien that has become 180 days or greater\npast due or placed on nonaccrual status. Any  \nsecured consumer lending segment loan whose   \nborrower has had debt discharged through      \nbankruptcy, for which the loan amount exceeds \nthe fair value of the collateral, is charged  \ndown to the fair value of the related         \ncollateral and the remaining balance is placed\non nonaccrual status. Credit card loans       \ncontinue to accrue interest until the account \nis charged-off. Credit cards are charged-off  \nat 180\u00a0days past due. Other retail loans not  \nsecured by 1-4 family properties are charged- \noff at 120 days past due; and revolving       \nconsumer lines are charged-off at 180 days    \npast due. Similar to credit cards, other      \nretail loans are generally not placed on      \nnonaccrual status because of the relative     \nshort period of time to charge-off. Certain   \nretail customers having financial difficulties\nmay have the terms of their credit card and   \nother loan agreements modified to require only\nprincipal payments and, as such, are reported \nas nonaccrual.                                \n                                              \nFor all loan classes, interest payments       \nreceived on nonaccrual loans are generally    \nrecorded as a reduction to a loan\u2019s carrying  \namount while a loan is on nonaccrual and are  \nrecognized as interest income upon payoff of  \nthe loan. However, interest income may be     \nrecognized for interest payments if the       \nremaining carrying amount of the loan is      \nbelieved to be collectible. In certain        \ncircumstances, loans in any class may be      \nrestored to accrual status, such as when a    \nloan has demonstrated sustained repayment     \nperformance or no amounts are past due and    \nprospects for future payment are no longer in \ndoubt; or when the loan becomes well secured  \nand is in the process of collection. Loans    \nwhere there has been a partial charge-off may \nbe returned to accrual status if all principal\nand interest (including amounts previously    \ncharged-off) is expected to be collected and  \nthe loan is current.                          \nThe following table provides a summary of     \nloans by portfolio class, including the       \ndelinquency status of those that continue to  \naccrue interest, and those that are           \nnonperforming:                                \n                                              \n  (\u2026                                          \n  in                       90                 \n  M\u2026                      Da\u2026                 \n  S\u2026              30-\u2026    or\u2026                 \n  3\u2026       Ac\u2026    Day\u2026    Pa\u2026    Non\u2026         \n  2\u2026       Cu\u2026     Due    Due     (b)    To\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  C\u2026    $  13\u2026       $      $    $122    $1\u2026  \n                   335     41                 \n  C\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026       40\u2026       8     19     167    40\u2026  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026       85\u2026      87     89     211    86\u2026  \n  (\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026       24\u2026     237    181       \u2013    24\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       59\u2026     244     63     130    59\u2026  \n  r\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026    $  34\u2026       $    $3\u2026    $630    $3\u2026  \n  l\u2026               911                        \n  D\u2026                                          \n  3\u2026                                          \n  2\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026    $  11\u2026       $      $    $174    $1\u2026  \n                   530     49                 \n  C\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026       38\u2026      80     11     284    39\u2026  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026       75\u2026     124    181     226    76\u2026  \n  (\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026       22\u2026     193    165       \u2013    22\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       61\u2026     275     66     150    61\u2026  \n  r\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026    $  30\u2026    $1,\u2026    $4\u2026    $834    $3\u2026  \n  l\u2026                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       At September\u00a030, 2022, $638million of  \n       loans 30\u201389 days past due and          \n       $1.9billion of loans 90 days or more   \n       past due purchased and that could be   \n       purchased from Government National     \n       Mortgage Association (\u201cGNMA\u201d)          \n       mortgage pools under delinquent loan   \n  (a)  repurchase options whose repayments    \n       are insured by the Federal Housing     \n       Administration or guaranteed by the    \n       United States Department of Veterans   \n       Affairs, were classified as current,   \n       compared with $791million and          \n       $1.5billion at December\u00a031, 2021,      \n       respectively.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Substantially all nonperforming loans  \n       at September 30, 2022 and December     \n       31, 2021, had an associated allowance  \n       for credit losses.

The post-       \nmodification balances for these loans reflect \nthe current outstanding balance until a       \npermanent modification is made. In addition,  \nthe post-modification balances typically      \ninclude capitalization of unpaid accrued      \ninterest and/or fees under the various        \nmodification programs. At September\u00a030, 2022, \n9 residential mortgages, 7 home equity and    \nsecond mortgage loans and 64 loans purchased  \nfrom GNMA mortgage pools with outstanding     \nbalances of less than $ 1 million, less than $\n1 million and $ 8 million, respectively, were \nin a trial period and have estimated post-    \nmodification balances of $ 1 million, less    \nthan $ 1 million and $ 8 million,             \nrespectively, assuming permanent modification \noccurs at the end of the trial period.        \n                                              \nThe Company has implemented certain           \nrestructuring programs that may result in     \nTDRs. However, many of the Company\u2019s TDRs are \nalso determined on a case-by-case basis in    \nconnection with ongoing loan collection       \nprocesses.                                    \n                                              \nFor the commercial lending segment,           \nmodifications generally result in the Company \nworking with borrowers on a case-by-case      \nbasis. Commercial and commercial real estate  \nmodifications generally include extensions of \nthe maturity date and may be accompanied by an\nincrease or decrease to the interest rate,    \nwhich may not be deemed a market interest     \nrate. In addition, the Company may work with  \nthe borrower in identifying other changes that\nmitigate loss to the Company, which may       \ninclude additional collateral or guarantees to\nsupport the loan. To a lesser extent, the     \nCompany may waive contractual principal. The  \nCompany classifies all of the above           \nconcessions as TDRs to the extent the Company \ndetermines that the borrower is experiencing  \nfinancial difficulty.                         \n                                              \nModifications for the consumer lending segment\nare generally part of programs the Company has\ninitiated. The Company modifies residential   \nmortgage loans under Federal Housing          \nAdministration, United States Department of   \nVeterans Affairs, or its own internal         \nprograms. Under these programs, the Company   \noffers qualifying homeowners the opportunity  \nto permanently modify their loan and achieve  \nmore affordable monthly payments by providing \nloan concessions. These concessions may       \ninclude adjustments to interest rates,        \nconversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates,\nextension of maturity dates or deferrals of   \npayments, capitalization of accrued interest  \nand/or outstanding advances, or in limited    \nsituations, partial forgiveness of loan       \nprincipal. In most instances, participation in\nresidential mortgage loan                     \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    49  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nrestructuring programs requires the customer  \nto complete a short-term trial period. A      \npermanent loan modification is contingent on  \nthe customer successfully completing the trial\nperiod arrangement, and the loan documents are\nnot modified until that time. The Company     \nreports loans in a trial period arrangement as\nTDRs and continues to report them as TDRs     \nafter the trial period.                       \n                                              \nCredit card and other retail loan TDRs are    \ngenerally part of distinct restructuring      \nprograms providing customers experiencing     \nfinancial difficulty with modifications       \nwhereby balances may be amortized up to 60    \nmonths, and generally include waiver of fees  \nand reduced interest rates.                   \n                                              \nIn

The majority of the\nCompany\u2019s financial asset transfers are       \nresidential mortgage loan sales primarily to  \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d),    \ntransfers of tax-advantaged investments,      \ncommercial loan sales through participation   \nagreements, and other individual or portfolio \nloan and securities sales. In accordance with \nthe accounting guidance for asset transfers,  \nthe Company considers any ongoing involvement \nwith transferred assets in determining whether\nthe assets can be derecognized from the       \nbalance sheet . Guarantees provided to certain\nthird parties in connection with the transfer \nof assets are further discussed in Note 16.   \nFor loans sold under participation agreements,\nthe Company also considers whether the terms  \nof the loan participation agreement meet the  \naccounting definition of a participating      \ninterest. With the exception of servicing and \ncertain performance-based guarantees, the     \nCompany\u2019s continuing involvement with         \nfinancial assets sold is minimal and generally\nlimited to market customary representation and\nwarranty clauses. Any gain or loss on sale    \ndepends on the previous carrying amount of the\ntransferred financial assets, the             \nconsideration received, and any liabilities   \nincurred in exchange for the transferred      \nassets. Upon transfer, any servicing assets   \nand other interests that continue to be held  \nby                                            \n                      \n  50    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nthe Company are initially recognized at fair  \nvalue .

On\na limited basis, the Company may acquire and  \npackage high-grade corporate bonds for select \ncorporate customers, in which the Company     \ngenerally has no continuing involvement with  \nthese transactions. Additionally, the Company \nis an authorized GNMA issuer and issues GNMA  \nsecurities on a regular basis. The Company has\nno other asset securitizations or similar     \nasset-backed financing arrangements that are  \noff-balance sheet.                            \n                                              \nThe Company previously provided financial     \nsupport primarily through the use of waivers  \nof trust and investment management fees       \nassociated with various unconsolidated        \nregistered money market funds it manages. The \nCompany discontinued providing this support   \nbeginning in the third quarter of 2022 due to \nrising interest rates in the current year. The\nCompany provided $ 67 million of support to   \nthe funds during the three months ended       \nSeptember\u00a030, 2021, and $ 65 million and $ 184\nmillion during the nine months ended          \nSeptember\u00a030, 2022 and 2021, respectively.    \n                                              \nThe Company is involved in various entities   \nthat are considered to be variable interest   \nentities (\u201cVIEs\u201d). The Company\u2019s investments  \nin VIEs are primarily related to investments  \npromoting affordable housing, community       \ndevelopment and renewable energy sources. Some\nof these tax-advantaged investments support   \nthe Company\u2019s regulatory compliance with the  \nCommunity Reinvestment Act. The Company\u2019s     \ninvestments in these entities generate a      \nreturn primarily through the realization of   \nfederal and state income tax credits, and     \nother tax benefits, such as tax deductions    \nfrom operating losses of the investments, over\nspecified time periods. These tax credits are \nrecognized as a reduction of tax expense or,  \nfor investments qualifying as investment tax  \ncredits, as a reduction to the related        \ninvestment asset. The Company recognized      \nfederal and state income tax credits related  \nto its affordable housing and other tax-      \nadvantaged investments in tax expense of $ 111\nmillion and $ 113 million for the three months\nended September\u00a030, 2022 and 2021,            \nrespectively, and $ 336 million and $ 356     \nmillion for the nine months ended             \nSeptember\u00a030, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The\nCompany also recognized $ 117 million and $ 75\nmillion of investment tax credits for the     \nthree months ended September\u00a030, 2022 and     \n2021, respectively, and $ 292 million and $   \n235 million for the nine months ended         \nSeptember\u00a030, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The\nCompany recognized $ 102 million and $ 101    \nmillion of expenses related to all of these   \ninvestments for the three months ended        \nSeptember\u00a030, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of \nwhich $ 87 million and $ 83 million,          \nrespectively, were included in tax expense and\nthe remaining amounts were included in        \nnoninterest expense. The Company recognized $ \n310 million and $ 333 million of expenses     \nrelated to all of these investments for the   \nnine months ended September\u00a030, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, of which $ 270 million and $ 262\nmillion, respectively, were included in tax   \nexpense and the remaining amounts were        \nincluded in noninterest expense.              \n                                              \nThe Company is not required to consolidate    \nVIEs in which it has concluded it does not    \nhave a controlling financial interest, and    \nthus is not the primary beneficiary. In such  \ncases, the Company does not have both the     \npower to direct the entities\u2019 most significant\nactivities and the obligation to absorb losses\nor the right to receive benefits that could   \npotentially be significant to the VIEs.       \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s investments in these            \nunconsolidated VIEs are carried in other      \nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The \nCompany\u2019s unfunded capital and other          \ncommitments related to these unconsolidated   \nVIEs are generally carried in other           \nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe Company\u2019s maximum exposure to loss from   \nthese unconsolidated VIEs include the         \ninvestment recorded on the Company\u2019s          \nConsolidated Balance Sheet, net of unfunded   \ncapital commitments, and previously recorded  \ntax credits which remain subject to recapture \nby taxing authorities based on compliance     \nfeatures required to be met at the project    \nlevel. While the Company believes potential   \nlosses from these investments are remote, the \nmaximum exposure was determined by assuming a \nscenario where the community-based business   \nand housing projects completely fail and do   \nnot meet certain government compliance        \nrequirements resulting in recapture of the    \nrelated tax credits.                          \nThe following table provides a summary of     \ninvestments in community development and tax- \nadvantagedVIEs that the Company has not       \nconsolidated:                                 \n                                              \n  (Dollars        September                   \n  in                    30,         December  \n  Millions)            2022          31,2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Investme\u2026                                   \n  carrying     $      5,617    $       4,484  \n  amount                                      \n  Unfunded                                    \n  capital             2,842            1,890  \n  and other                                   \n  commitme\u2026                                   \n  Maximum                                     \n  exposure            9,922            9,899  \n  to loss                                     \n                                              \nThe Company also has noncontrolling financial \ninvestments in private investment funds and   \npartnerships considered to be VIEs, which are \nnot consolidated.

The maximum exposure to loss related\nto these VIEs was $ 87million at September 30,\n2022 and $ 84million at December 31, 2021,    \nrepresenting the Company\u2019s investment balance \nand its unfunded commitments to invest        \nadditional amounts. The Company\u2019s individual  \nnet investments in unconsolidated VIEs, which \nexclude any unfunded capital commitments,     \nranged from less than $ 1million to $         \n123million at September 30, 2022, compared    \nwith less than $ 1million to $ 75million at   \nDecember 31, 2021. The Company is required to \nconsolidate VIEs in which it has concluded it \nhas a controlling financial interest.The      \nCompany sponsors entities to which it         \ntransfers its interests in tax-               \nadvantagedinvestments to third parties. At    \nSeptember 30, 2022, approximately $ 5.2billion\nof the Company\u2019s assets and $ 3.7billion of   \nits liabilities included on the Consolidated  \nBalance Sheet were related to community       \ndevelopment and tax-advantagedinvestment VIEs \nwhich the Company has consolidated, primarily \nrelated to these transfers. These amounts     \ncompared to $ 5.0billion and $ 3.4billion,    \nrespectively, at December 31, 2021. The       \nmajority of the assets of these consolidated  \nVIEs are reported in other assets, and the    \nliabilities are reported in long-term debt and\nother liabilities. The assets of a particular \nVIE are the primary source of funds to settle \nits obligations. The creditors of the VIEs do \nnot have recourse to the general credit of the\nCompany. The Company\u2019s exposure to the        \nconsolidated VIEs is generally limited to the \ncarrying value of its variable interests plus \nany related tax credits previously recognized \nor transferred to others with a guarantee. In \naddition, the Company sponsors a municipal    \nbond securities tender option bond program.   \nThe Company controls the activities of the    \nprogram\u2019s entities, is entitled to the        \nresidual returns and provides liquidity and   \nremarketing arrangements to the program. As a \nresult, the Company has consolidated the      \nprogram\u2019s entities. At September 30, 2022, $  \n1.4billion of available-for-saleinvestment    \nsecurities and $ 1.5billion of short-term     \nborrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet  \nwere related to the tender option bond        \nprogram, compared with $ 1.7billion of        \navailable-for-saleinvestment securities and $ \n1.2billion of short-term borrowings at        \nDecember 31, 2021.                            \n                                       \n  Note\u00a07    Mortgage Servicing Rights  \n                                       \nThe Company capitalizes MSRs as separate      \nassets when loans are sold and servicing is   \nretained. MSRs may also be purchased from     \nothers. The Company carries MSRs at fair      \nvalue, with changes in the fair value recorded\nin earnings during the period in which they   \noccur. The Company serviced $ 229.0 billion of\nresidential mortgage loans for others at      \nSeptember\u00a030, 2022, and $ 222.4 billion at    \nDecember\u00a031, 2021, including subserviced      \nmortgages with no corresponding MSR asset.    \nIncluded in mortgage banking revenue are the  \nMSR fair value changes arising from market    \nrate and model assumption changes, net of the \nvalue change in derivatives used to           \neconomically hedge MSRs. These changes        \nresulted in net losses of $ 19 million and $  \n21 million for the three months ended         \nSeptember\u00a030, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and\nnet losses of $ 35 million and $ 168 million  \nfor the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2022  \nand 2021, respectively. Loan servicing and    \nancillary fees, not including valuation       \nchanges, included in mortgage banking revenue \nwere $ 190 million and $ 183 million for the  \nthree months ended September\u00a030, 2022 and 2021\nrespectively, and $ 561 million and $ 536     \nmillion for the nine months ended             \nSeptember\u00a030, 2022 and 2021, respectively.    \nChanges in fair value of capitalized MSRs are \nsummarized as follows:                        \n                                              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026          \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026         \u2026    \n         1          9          7         \u2026    \n         \u2026          \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n         \u2014          \u2014          1         1    \n                                              \n         \u2026          \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n         \u2026  )       \u2026  )       \u2026  )      \u2026    \n         \u2026  )       \u2026  )       \u2026  )      \u2026    \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026         \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n       MSRs sold include those having a       \n  (a)  negative fair value, resulting from    \n       the loans being severely delinquent.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Includes changes in MSR value          \n       associated with changes in market      \n  (b)  interest rates, including estimated    \n       prepayment rates and anticipated       \n       earnings on escrow deposits.           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Includes changes in MSR value not      \n       caused by changes in market interest   \n  (c)  rates, such as changes in assumed      \n       cost to service, ancillary income and  \n       option adjusted spread, as well as     \n       the impact of any model changes.       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Primarily the change in MSR value      \n       from passage of time and cash flows    \n       realized (decay), but also includes    \n  (d)  the impact of changes to expected      \n       cash flows not associated with         \n       changes in market interest rates,      \n       such as the impact of delinquencies.   \n                                              \n                      \n  52    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThe estimated sensitivity to changes in       \ninterest rates of the fair value of the MSR   \nportfolio and the related derivative          \ninstruments was as follows:                   \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nThe fair value of MSRs and their sensitivity  \nto changes in interest rates is influenced by \nthe mix of the servicing portfolio and        \ncharacteristics of each segment of the        \nportfolio.

On  \nan ongoing basis, numerous federal, state,    \nlocal and foreign examinations are in progress\nand cover multiple tax years. As of           \nSeptember\u00a030, 2022, federal tax examinations  \nfor all years ending through December\u00a031, 2014\nare completed and resolved. The Company\u2019s tax \nreturns for the years ended December\u00a031, 2015 \nthrough December\u00a031, 2020 are under           \nexamination by the Internal Revenue Service.  \nThe years open to examination by foreign,     \nstate and local government authorities vary by\njurisdiction.                                 \nThe Company\u2019s net deferred tax asset was $ 4.4\nbillion at September\u00a030, 2022 and $ 785       \nmillion at December\u00a031, 2021.                 \n                                      \n  Note\u00a0\u00a013    Derivative Instruments  \n                                      \nIn the ordinary course of business, the       \nCompany enters into derivative transactions to\nmanage various risks and to accommodate the   \nbusiness requirements of its customers. The   \nCompany recognizes all derivatives on the     \nConsolidated Balance Sheet at fair value in   \nother assets or in other liabilities. On the  \ndate the Company enters into a derivative     \ncontract, the derivative is designated as     \neither a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge,   \nnet investment hedge, or a designation is not \nmade as it is a customer-related transaction, \nan economic hedge for asset/liability risk    \nmanagement purposes or another stand-alone    \nderivative created through the Company\u2019s      \noperations (\u201cfree-standing derivative\u201d). When \na derivative is designated as a fair value,   \ncash flow or net investment hedge, the Company\nperforms an assessment, at inception and, at a\nminimum, quarterly thereafter, to determine   \nthe effectiveness of the derivative in        \noffsetting changes in the value or cash flows \nof the hedged item(s).                        \nFair Value Hedges These derivatives are       \ninterest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge \nthe change in fair value related to interest  \nrate changes of its underlying available-for- \nsaleinvestment securities and fixed-rate debt.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives      \ndesignated as fair value hedges, and changes  \nin the fair value of the hedged items, are    \nrecorded in earnings.                         \nCash Flow Hedges These derivatives are        \ninterest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge \nthe forecasted cash flows from its underlying \nvariable-rate loans and debt. Changes in the  \nfair value of derivatives designated as cash  \nflow hedges are recorded in other             \ncomprehensive income (loss) until the cash    \nflows of the hedged items are realized. If a  \nderivative designated as a cash flow hedge is \nterminated or ceases to be highly effective,  \nthe gain or loss in other comprehensive income\n(loss) is                                     \n                      \n  56    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\namortized to earnings over the period the     \nforecasted hedged transactions impact         \nearnings. If a hedged forecasted transaction  \nis no longer probable, hedge accounting is    \nceased and any gain or loss included in other \ncomprehensive income (loss) is reported in    \nearnings immediately, unless the forecasted   \ntransaction is at least reasonably possible of\noccurring, whereby the amounts remain within  \nother comprehensive income (loss). At         \nSeptember 30, 2022, the Company had $         \n163million (net-of-tax)of realized and        \nunrealized losseson derivatives classified as \ncash flow hedges recorded in other            \ncomprehensive income (loss), compared with $  \n85million (net-of-tax)of realized and         \nunrealized losses at December 31, 2021. The   \nestimated amount to be reclassified from other\ncomprehensive income (loss) into earnings     \nduring the next 12 months is a loss of $      \n11million (net-of-tax).All cash flow hedges   \nwere highly effective for the three months    \nended September 30, 2022. There were          \nnoderivatives held as cash flow hedges at     \nDecember 31, 2021. Net Investment Hedges The  \nCompany uses forward commitments to sell      \nspecified amounts of certain foreign          \ncurrencies, and non-derivativedebt            \ninstruments, to hedge the volatility of its   \nnet investment in foreign operations driven by\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange     \nrates. The carrying amount of non-            \nderivativedebt instruments designated as net  \ninvestment hedges was $ 1.1billion at         \nSeptember 30, 2022, compared with $ 1.3billion\nat December 31, 2021. Other Derivative        \nPositions The Company enters into free-       \nstanding derivatives to mitigate interest rate\nrisk and for other risk management purposes.  \nThese derivatives include forward commitments \nto sell to-be-announcedsecurities (\u201cTBAs\u201d) and\nother commitments to sell residential mortgage\nloans, which are used to economically hedge   \nthe interest rate risk related to mortgage    \nloans held for sale (\u201cMLHFS\u201d) and unfunded    \nmortgage loan commitments. The Company also   \nenters into interest rate swaps, swaptions,   \nforward commitments to buy TBAs, U.S. Treasury\nand Eurodollar futures and options on U.S.    \nTreasury futures to economically hedge the    \nchange in the fair value of the Company\u2019s     \nMSRs. The Company also enters into foreign    \ncurrency forwards to economically hedge       \nremeasurement gains and losses the Company    \nrecognizes on foreign currency denominated    \nassets and liabilities. In addition, the      \nCompany acts as a seller and buyer of interest\nrate derivatives and foreign exchange         \ncontracts for its customers. The Company      \nmitigates the market and liquidity risk       \nassociated with these customer derivatives by \nentering into similar offsetting positions    \nwith broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis  \nby entering into other derivative or non-     \nderivativefinancial instruments that partially\nor fully offset the exposure to earnings from \nthese customer-related positions. The         \nCompany\u2019s customer derivatives and related    \nhedges are monitored and reviewed by the      \nCompany\u2019s Market Risk Committee, which        \nestablishes policies for market risk          \nmanagement, including exposure limits for each\nportfolio.

The Company measures    \nthat credit risk using a credit valuation     \nadjustment and includes it within the fair    \nvalue of the derivative. The Company manages  \ncounterparty credit risk through              \ndiversification of its derivative positions   \namong various counterparties, by entering into\nderivative positions that are centrally       \ncleared through clearinghouses, by entering   \ninto master netting arrangements and, where   \npossible, by requiring collateral             \narrangements. A master netting arrangement    \nallows two counterparties, who have multiple  \nderivative contracts with each other, the     \nability to net settle amounts under all       \ncontracts, including any related collateral,  \nthrough a single payment and in a single      \ncurrency. Collateral arrangements generally   \nrequire the counterparty to deliver collateral\n(typically cash or U.S. Treasury and agency   \nsecurities) equal to the Company\u2019s net        \nderivative receivable, subject to minimum     \ntransfer and credit rating requirements.      \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s collateral arrangements are     \npredominately bilateral and, therefore,       \ncontain provisions that require               \ncollateralization of the Company\u2019s net        \nliability derivative positions. Required      \ncollateral coverage is based on net liability \nthresholds and may be contingent upon the     \nCompany\u2019s credit rating from two of the       \nnationally recognized statistical rating      \norganizations. If the Company\u2019s credit rating \nwere to fall below credit ratings thresholds  \nestablished in the collateral arrangements,   \nthe counterparties to the derivatives could   \nrequest immediate additional collateral       \ncoverage up to and including full collateral  \ncoverage for derivatives in a net liability   \nposition. The aggregate fair value of all     \nderivatives under collateral arrangements that\nwere in a net liability position at           \nSeptember\u00a030, 2022, was $ 2.8 billion.

The Company\u2019s derivative     \ncontracts typically include offsetting rights \n(referred to as netting arrangements), and    \ndepending on expected volume, credit risk, and\ncounterparty preference, collateral           \nmaintenance may be required. For all          \nderivatives under collateral support          \narrangements, fair value is determined daily  \nand, depending on the collateral maintenance  \nrequirements, the Company and a counterparty  \nmay receive or deliver collateral, based upon \nthe net fair value of all derivative positions\nbetween the Company and the counterparty.     \nCollateral is typically cash, but securities  \nmay be allowed under collateral arrangements  \nwith certain counterparties. Receivables and  \npayables related to cash collateral are       \nincluded in other assets and other liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet, along with \nthe related derivative asset and liability    \nfair values. Any securities pledged to        \ncounterparties as collateral remain on the    \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Securities        \nreceived from counterparties as collateral are\nnot recognized on the Consolidated Balance    \nSheet, unless the counterparty defaults. In   \ngeneral, securities used as collateral can be \nsold, repledged or otherwise used by the party\nin possession. No restrictions exist on the   \nuse of cash collateral by either party. Refer \nto Note 13 for further discussion of the      \nCompany\u2019s derivatives, including collateral   \narrangements. As part of the Company\u2019s        \ntreasury and broker-dealer operations, the    \nCompany executes transactions that are treated\nas securities sold under agreements to        \nrepurchase or securities purchased under      \nagreements to resell, both of which are       \naccounted for as collateralized financings.   \nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase\ninclude repurchase agreements and securities  \nloaned transactions. Securities purchased     \nunder agreements to resell include reverse    \nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed \ntransactions. For securities sold under       \nagreements to repurchase, the Company records \na liability for the cash received, which is   \nincluded in short-term borrowings on the      \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. For securities    \npurchased under agreements to resell, the     \nCompany records a receivable for the cash     \npaid, which is included in other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Securities        \ntransferred to counterparties under repurchase\nagreements and securities loaned transactions \ncontinue to be recognized on the Consolidated \nBalance Sheet, are measured at fair value, and\nare included in investment securities or other\nassets. Securities received from              \ncounterparties under reverse repurchase       \nagreements and securities borrowed            \ntransactions are not recognized on the        \nConsolidated Balance Sheet unless the         \ncounterparty defaults. The securities         \ntransferred under repurchase and reverse      \nrepurchase transactions typically are U.S.    \nTreasury and agency securities, residential   \nagency mortgage-backed securities or corporate\ndebt securities. The securities loaned or     \nborrowed typically are corporate debt         \nsecurities traded by the Company\u2019s broker-    \ndealer subsidiary. In general, the securities \ntransferred can be sold, repledged or         \notherwise used by the party in possession. No \nrestrictions exist on the use of cash         \ncollateral by either party. Repurchase/reverse\nrepurchase and securities loaned/borrowed     \ntransactions expose the Company to            \ncounterparty risk. The Company manages this   \nrisk by performing assessments, independent of\nbusiness line managers, and establishing      \nconcentration limits on each counterparty.    \nAdditionally, these transactions include      \ncollateral arrangements that require the fair \nvalues of the underlying securities to be     \ndetermined daily, resulting in cash being     \nobtained or refunded to counterparties to     \nmaintain specified collateral levels.         \n                      \n  60    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the maturities \nby category of collateral pledged for         \nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned   \ntransactions:                                 \n                                              \n                 \u2026                \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026                \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026                \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       T\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  3\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       8\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       7\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  2\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  3\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       5\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       6\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  1\u2026  \n                                              \nThe Company executes its derivative,          \nrepurchase/reverse repurchase and securities  \nloaned/borrowed transactions under the        \nrespective industry standard agreements.

Additionally, from time to   \ntime, the Company may be required to record at\nfair value other assets on a nonrecurring     \nbasis, such as loans held for sale, loans held\nfor investment and certain other assets. These\nnonrecurring fair value adjustments typically \ninvolve application of lower-of-cost-or-fair  \nvalue accounting or impairment write-downs of \nindividual assets.                            \nFair value is defined as the exchange price   \nthat would be received for an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability (an exit price) in the   \nprincipal or most advantageous market for the \nasset or liability in an orderly transaction  \nbetween market participants on the measurement\ndate. A fair value measurement reflects all of\nthe assumptions that market participants would\nuse in pricing the asset or liability,        \nincluding assumptions about the risk inherent \nin a particular valuation technique, the      \neffect of a restriction on the sale or use of \nan asset and the risk of nonperformance.      \nThe Company groups its assets and liabilities \nmeasured at fair value into a three-level     \nhierarchy for valuation techniques used to    \nmeasure financial assets and financial        \nliabilities at fair value. This hierarchy is  \nbased on whether the valuation inputs are     \nobservable or unobservable. These levels are: \n                                              \n       Level\u00a01 \u2014 Quoted prices in active      \n       markets for identical assets or        \n  \u2022    liabilities. Level\u00a01 includes U.S.     \n       Treasury securities, as well as        \n       exchange-traded instruments.           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Level\u00a02 \u2014 Observable inputs other      \n       than Level\u00a01 prices, such as quoted    \n       prices for similar assets or           \n       liabilities; quoted prices in markets  \n       that are not active; or other inputs   \n       that are observable or can be          \n       corroborated by observable market      \n       data for substantially the full term   \n       of the assets or liabilities.

This category includes     \n       MSRs and certain derivative            \n       contracts.                             \n                                              \n                      \n  62    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nValuation Methodologies The valuation         \nmethodologies used by the Company to measure  \nfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value\nare described below. In addition, the         \nfollowing section includes an indication of   \nthe level of the fair value hierarchy in which\nthe assets or liabilities are classified.     \nWhere appropriate, the descriptions include   \ninformation about the valuation models and key\ninputs to those models. During the nine months\nended September 30, 2022 and 2021, there were \nno significant changes to the valuation       \ntechniques used by the Company to measure fair\nvalue. Available-For-SaleInvestment Securities\nWhen quoted market prices for identical       \nsecurities are available in an active market, \nthese prices are used to determine fair value \nand these securities are classified within    \nLevel 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 1  \ninvestment securities include U.S. Treasury   \nand exchange-traded securities. For other     \nsecurities, quoted market prices may not be   \nreadily available for the specific securities.\nWhen possible, the Company determines fair    \nvalue based on market observable information, \nincluding quoted market prices for similar    \nsecurities, inactive transaction prices, and  \nbroker quotes. These securities are classified\nwithin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.   \nLevel 2 valuations are generally provided by a\nthird-party pricing service. Level 2          \ninvestment securities are predominantly agency\nmortgage-backed securities, certain other     \nasset-backed securities, obligations of state \nand political subdivisions and agency debt    \nsecurities. Mortgage Loans Held For Sale MLHFS\nmeasured at fair value, for which an active   \nsecondary market and readily available market \nprices exist, are initially valued at the     \ntransaction price and are subsequently valued \nby comparison to instruments with similar     \ncollateral and risk profiles. MLHFS are       \nclassified within Level 2. Included in        \nmortgage banking revenue were net losses of $ \n144million and $ 18million for the three      \nmonths ended September 30, 2022 and 2021,     \nrespectively, and net losses of $ 442million  \nand $ 135million for the nine months ended    \nSeptember 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively,    \nfrom the changes to fair value of these MLHFS \nunder fair value option accounting guidance.  \nChanges in fair value due to instrument       \nspecific credit risk were immaterial. Interest\nincome for MLHFS is measured based on         \ncontractual interest rates and reported as    \ninterest income on the Consolidated Statement \nof Income. Electing to measure MLHFS at fair  \nvalue reduces certain timing differences and  \nbetter matches changes in fair value of these \nassets with changes in the value of the       \nderivative instruments used to economically   \nhedge them without the burden of complying    \nwith the requirements for hedge accounting.   \nMortgage Servicing Rights MSRs are valued     \nusing a discounted cash flow methodology, and \nare classified within Level 3. The Company    \ndetermines fair value of the MSRs by          \nprojecting future cash flows for different    \ninterest rate scenarios using prepayment rates\nand other assumptions, and discounts these    \ncash flows using a risk adjusted rate based on\noption adjusted spread levels. There is       \nminimal observable market activity for MSRs on\ncomparable portfolios and, therefore, the     \ndetermination of fair value requires          \nsignificant management judgment. Refer to Note\n7 for further information on MSR valuation    \nassumptions. Derivatives The majority of      \nderivatives held by the Company are executed  \nover-the-counteror centrally cleared through  \nclearinghouses and are valued using market    \nstandard cash flow valuation techniques. The  \nmodels incorporate inputs, depending on the   \ntype of derivative, including interest rate   \ncurves, foreign exchange rates and volatility.\nAll derivative values incorporate an          \nassessment of the risk of counterparty        \nnonperformance, measured based on the         \nCompany\u2019s evaluation of credit risk including \nexternal assessments of credit risk. The      \nCompany monitors and manages its              \nnonperformance risk by considering its ability\nto net derivative positions under master      \nnetting arrangements, as well as collateral   \nreceived or provided under collateral         \narrangements. Accordingly, the Company has    \nelected to measure the fair value of          \nderivatives, at a counterparty level, on a net\nbasis. The majority of the derivatives are    \nclassified within Level 2 of the fair value   \nhierarchy, as the significant inputs to the   \nmodels, including nonperformance risk, are    \nobservable. However, certain derivative       \ntransactions are with counterparties where    \nrisk of nonperformance cannot be observed in  \nthe market and, therefore, the credit         \nvaluation adjustments result in these         \nderivatives being classified within Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy. The Company also has\nother derivative contracts that are created   \nthrough its operations, including commitments \nto purchase and originate mortgage loans and  \nswap agreements executed in conjunction with  \nthe sale of a portion of its Class B common   \nand preferred shares of Visa Inc. (the \u201cVisa  \nswaps\u201d). The mortgage loan commitments are    \nvalued by pricing models that include market  \nobservable and unobservable inputs, which     \nresult in the commitments being classified    \nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.   \nThe unobservable inputs include assumptions   \nabout the percentage of commitments that      \nactually become a closed loan and the MSR     \nvalue that is inherent in the underlying loan \nvalue.                                        \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    63  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThe Visa swaps require payments by either the \nCompany or the purchaser of the Visa Inc.     \nClass\u00a0B common and preferred shares when there\nare changes in the conversion rate of the Visa\nInc. Class\u00a0B common and preferred shares to   \nVisa Inc. Class\u00a0A common and preferred shares,\nrespectively, as well as quarterly payments to\nthe purchaser based on specified terms of the \nagreements. Management reviews and updates the\nVisa swaps fair value in conjunction with its \nreview of Visa Inc. related litigation        \ncontingencies, and the associated escrow      \nfunding.

The  \ndiscussion below excludes nonrecurring fair   \nvalue measurements of collateral value used   \nfor impairment measures for loans and OREO.   \nThese valuations utilize third party appraisal\nor broker price opinions, and are classified  \nas Level\u00a03 due to the significant judgment    \ninvolved.                                     \n                                              \nMortgage Servicing Rights The significant     \nunobservable inputs used in the fair value    \nmeasurement of the Company\u2019s MSRs are expected\nprepayments and the option adjusted spread    \nthat is added to the risk-free rate to        \ndiscount projected cash flows. Significant    \nincreases in either of these inputs in        \nisolation would have resulted in a            \nsignificantly lower fair value measurement.   \nSignificant decreases in either of these      \ninputs in isolation would have resulted in a  \nsignificantly higher fair value measurement.  \nThere is no direct interrelationship between  \nprepayments and option adjusted spread.       \nPrepayment rates generally move in the        \nopposite direction of market interest rates.  \nOption adjusted spread is generally impacted  \nby changes in market return requirements.     \nThe following table shows the significant     \nvaluation assumption ranges for MSRs at       \nSeptember\u00a030, 2022:                           \n                                              \n                                   Weigh\u2026     \n          Minim\u2026       Maxi\u2026       Avera\u2026     \n                                      (a)     \n  Exp\u2026         5  %       11  %         7  %  \n  pre\u2026                                        \n  Opt\u2026                                        \n  adj\u2026         5          11            6     \n  spr\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Determined based on the relative fair  \n  (a)  value of the related mortgage loans    \n       serviced.                              \n                                              \nDerivatives The Company has two distinct Level\n3 derivative portfolios: (i) the Company\u2019s    \ncommitments to purchase and originate mortgage\nloans that meet the requirements of a         \nderivative and (ii) the Company\u2019s             \nasset/liability and customer-related          \nderivatives that are Level 3 due to           \nunobservable inputs related to measurement of \nrisk of nonperformance by the counterparty.

A significant increase \nin the rate of loans that close would have    \nresulted in a larger derivative asset or      \nliability. A significant increase in the      \ninherent MSR value would have resulted in an  \nincrease in the derivative asset or a         \nreduction in the derivative liability.        \nExpected loan close rates and the inherent MSR\nvalues are directly impacted by changes in    \nmarket rates and will generally move in the   \nsame direction as interest rates.             \nThe following table shows the significant     \nvaluation assumption ranges for the Company\u2019s \nderivative commitments to purchase and        \noriginate mortgage loans at September\u00a030,     \n2022:                                         \n                                              \n                                   Weigh\u2026     \n          Minim\u2026       Maxi\u2026       Avera\u2026     \n                                      (a)     \n  Exp\u2026                                        \n  loan        19  %      100  %        84  %  \n  clo\u2026                                        \n  rate                                        \n  Inh\u2026                                        \n  MSR                                         \n  val\u2026                                        \n  (ba\u2026        41         194          112     \n  poi\u2026                                        \n  per                                         \n  loa\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  (a)  Determined based on the relative fair  \n       value of the related mortgage loans.   \n                                              \nThe significant unobservable input used in the\nfair value measurement of certain of the      \nCompany\u2019s asset/liability and customer-related\nderivatives is the credit valuation adjustment\nrelated to the risk of counterparty           \nnonperformance.                               \n                      \n  64    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nA significant increase in the credit valuation\nadjustment would have resulted in a lower fair\nvalue measurement. A significant decrease in  \nthe credit valuation adjustment would have    \nresulted in a higher fair value measurement.  \nThe credit valuation adjustment is impacted by\nchanges in market rates, volatility, market   \nimplied credit spreads, and loss recovery     \nrates, as well as the Company\u2019s assessment of \nthe counterparty\u2019s credit position.

Inc. card association \nor its affiliates (collectively \u201cVisa\u201d). In   \n2007, Visa completed a restructuring and      \nissued shares of Visa Inc. common stock to its\nfinancial institution members in contemplation\nof its initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d)        \ncompleted in the first quarter of 2008 (the   \n\u201cVisa Reorganization\u201d). As a part of the Visa \nReorganization, the Company received its      \nproportionate number of shares of Visa Inc.   \ncommon stock, which were subsequently         \nconverted to Class B shares of Visa Inc.      \n(\u201cClass B shares\u201d).                           \nVisa U.S.A. Inc. (\u201cVisa U.S.A.\u201d) and          \nMasterCard International (collectively, the   \n\u201cCard Brands\u201d) are defendants in antitrust    \nlawsuits challenging the practices of the Card\nBrands (the \u201cVisa Litigation\u201d). Visa U.S.A.   \nmember banks have a contingent obligation to  \nindemnify Visa Inc. under the Visa U.S.A.     \nbylaws (which were modified at the time of the\nrestructuring in October 2007) for potential  \nlosses arising from the Visa Litigation. The  \nindemnification by the Visa U.S.A. member     \nbanks has no specific maximum amount. Using   \nproceeds from its IPO and through reductions  \nto the conversion ratio applicable to the     \nClass\u00a0B shares held by Visa U.S.A. member     \nbanks, Visa Inc. has funded an escrow account \nfor the benefit of member financial           \ninstitutions to fund their indemnification    \nobligations associated with the Visa          \nLitigation. The receivable related to the     \nescrow account is classified in other         \nliabilities as a direct offset to the related \nVisa Litigation contingent liability.         \nIn October 2012, Visa signed a settlement     \nagreement to resolve class action claims      \nassociated with the multidistrict interchange \nlitigation pending in the United States       \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork (the \u201cMulti-District Litigation\u201d). The   \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit  \nreversed the approval of that settlement and  \nremanded the matter to the district court.    \nThereafter, the case was split into two       \nputative class actions, one seeking damages   \n(the \u201cDamages Action\u201d) and a separate class   \naction seeking injunctive relief only (the    \n\u201cInjunctive Action\u201d). In September 2018, Visa \nsigned a new settlement agreement, superseding\nthe original settlement agreement, to resolve \nthe Damages Action. The Damages Action        \nsettlement was approved by the United States  \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork, but is now on appeal. The Injunctive    \nAction, which generally seeks changes to Visa \nrules, is still pending.                      \n                      \n  68    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nOther Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities   \nThe following table is a summary of other     \nguarantees and contingent liabilities of the  \nCompany at September\u00a030, 2022:                \n                                              \n                                   Maxi\u2026      \n  (D\u2026                              Pote\u2026      \n  in        Coll\u2026       Car\u2026       Futu\u2026      \n  Mi\u2026        Held       Amo\u2026       Paym\u2026      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  St\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026    $      \u2014    $    53    $  9,974      \n  of                                          \n  cr\u2026                                         \n  Th\u2026                                         \n  pa\u2026           \u2014          \u2014          10      \n  bo\u2026                                         \n  ar\u2026                                         \n  Se\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026       6,869          \u2014       6,625      \n  in\u2026                                         \n  As\u2026           \u2014         89       7,616  -a  \n  sa\u2026                                         \n  Me\u2026         727        123       139,\u2026      \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  Te\u2026                                         \n  op\u2026                                         \n  bo\u2026       1,418          \u2014       1,497      \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  gu\u2026                                         \n  Ot\u2026           \u2014         21       2,081      \n                                              \n                                              \n       The maximum potential future payments  \n       do not include loan sales where the    \n       Company provides standard              \n       representation and warranties to the   \n       buyer against losses related to loan   \n       underwriting documentation defects     \n       that may have existed at the time of   \n       sale that generally are identified     \n       after the occurrence of a triggering   \n       event such as delinquency. For these   \n  (a)  types of loan sales, the maximum       \n       potential future payments is           \n       generally the unpaid principal         \n       balance of loans sold measured at the  \n       end of the current reporting period.   \n       Actual losses will be significantly    \n       less than the maximum exposure, as     \n       only a fraction of loans sold will     \n       have a representation and warranty     \n       breach, and any losses on repurchase   \n       would generally be mitigated by any    \n       collateral held against the loans.     \n                                              \nMerchant Processing The Company, through its  \nsubsidiaries, provides merchant processing    \nservices. Under the rules of credit card      \nassociations, a merchant processor retains a  \ncontingent liability for credit card          \ntransactions processed. This contingent       \nliability arises in the event of a billing    \ndispute between the merchant and a cardholder \nthat is ultimately resolved in the            \ncardholder\u2019s favor. In this situation, the    \ntransaction is \u201ccharged-back\u201d to the merchant \nand the disputed amount is credited or        \notherwise refunded to the cardholder. If the  \nCompany is unable to collect this amount from \nthe merchant, it bears the loss for the amount\nof the refund paid to the cardholder.         \n                                              \nThe Company currently processes card          \ntransactions in the United States, Canada and \nEurope through wholly-owned subsidiaries. In  \nthe event a merchant was unable to fulfill    \nproduct or services subject to future         \ndelivery, such as airline tickets, the Company\ncould become financially liable for refunding \nthe purchase price of such products or        \nservices purchased through the credit card    \nassociations under the charge-back provisions.\nCharge-back risk related to these merchants is\nevaluated in a manner similar to credit risk  \nassessments and, as such, merchant processing \ncontracts contain various provisions to       \nprotect the Company in the event of default.  \nAt September\u00a030, 2022, the value of airline   \ntickets purchased to be delivered at a future \ndate through card transactions processed by   \nthe Company was $ 9.3 billion. The Company    \nheld collateral of $ 536 million in escrow    \ndeposits, letters of credit and indemnities   \nfrom financial institutions, and liens on     \nvarious assets. In addition to specific       \ncollateral or other credit enhancements, the  \nCompany maintains a liability for its implied \nguarantees associated with future delivery. At\nSeptember\u00a030, 2022, the liability was $ 105   \nmillion primarily related to these airline    \nprocessing arrangements.                      \n                                              \nAsset Sales The Company regularly sells loans \nto GSEs as part of its mortgage banking       \nactivities. The Company provides customary    \nrepresentations and warranties to GSEs in     \nconjunction with these sales. These           \nrepresentations and warranties generally      \nrequire the Company to repurchase assets if it\nis subsequently determined that a loan did not\nmeet specified criteria, such as a            \ndocumentation deficiency or rescission of     \nmortgage insurance. If the Company is unable  \nto cure or refute a repurchase request, the   \nCompany is generally obligated to repurchase  \nthe loan or otherwise reimburse the GSE for   \nlosses. At September 30, 2022, the Company had\nreserved $ 13million for potential losses from\nrepresentation and warranty obligations,      \ncompared with $ 18million at December 31,     \n2021. The Company\u2019s reserve reflects          \nmanagement\u2019s best estimate of losses for      \nrepresentation and warranty obligations. The  \nCompany\u2019s repurchase reserve is modeled at the\nloan level, taking into consideration the     \nindividual credit quality and borrower        \nactivity that has transpired since            \norigination. The model applies credit quality \nand economic risk factors to derive a         \nprobability of default and potential          \nrepurchase that are based on the Company\u2019s    \nhistorical loss experience, and estimates loss\nseverity based on expected collateral value.  \nThe Company also considers qualitative factors\nthat may result in anticipated losses         \ndiffering from historical loss trends.        \n                                              \nAs of September\u00a030, 2022 and December\u00a031,     \n2021, the Company had $ 39 million and $ 19   \nmillion, respectively, of unresolved          \nrepresentation and warranty claims from GSEs. \nThe Company does not have a significant amount\nof unresolved claims from investors other than\nGSEs.                                         \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    69  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters The Company \nis subject to various litigation and          \nregulatory matters that arise in the ordinary \ncourse of its business. The Company           \nestablishes reserves for such matters when    \npotential losses become probable and can be   \nreasonably estimated. The Company believes the\nultimate resolution of existing legal and     \nregulatory matters will not have a material   \nadverse effect on the financial condition,    \nresults of operations or cash flows of the    \nCompany. However, in light of the             \nuncertainties inherent in these matters, it is\npossible that the ultimate resolution of one  \nor more of these matters may have a material  \nadverse effect on the Company\u2019s results from  \noperations for a particular period, and future\nchanges in circumstances or additional        \ninformation could result in additional        \naccruals or resolution in excess of           \nestablished accruals, which could adversely   \naffect the Company\u2019s results from operations, \npotentially materially. Residential Mortgage- \nBacked Securities Litigation Starting in 2011,\nthe Company and other large financial         \ninstitutions have been sued in their capacity \nas trustee for residential mortgage\u2013backed    \nsecurities trusts. In the lawsuits brought    \nagainst the Company, the investors and a      \nmonoline insurer allege that the Company\u2019s    \nbanking subsidiary, U.S. Bank National        \nAssociation (\u201cU.S. Bank\u201d), as trustee caused  \nthem to incur substantial losses by failing to\nenforce loan repurchase obligations and       \nfailing to abide by appropriate standards of  \ncare after events of default allegedly        \noccurred. The plaintiffs in these matters seek\nmonetary damages in unspecified amounts and   \nmost also seek equitable relief. Regulatory   \nMatters The Company is continually subject to \nexaminations, inquiries and investigations in \nareas of heightened regulatory scrutiny, such \nas compliance, risk management, third-party   \nrisk management and consumer protection. For  \nexample, the Consumer Financial Protection    \nBureau is investigating the Company\u2019s         \nadministration of unemployment insurance      \nbenefit prepaid debit cards during the        \npandemic timeframe. The Company is cooperating\nfully with all pending examinations, inquiries\nand investigations, any of which could lead to\nadministrative or legal proceedings or        \nsettlements. Remedies in these proceedings or \nsettlements may include fines, penalties,     \nrestitution or alterations in the Company\u2019s   \nbusiness practices (which may increase the    \nCompany\u2019s operating expenses and decrease its \nrevenue). Outlook Due to their complex nature,\nit can be years before litigation and         \nregulatory matters are resolved. The Company  \nmay be unable to develop an estimate or range \nof loss where matters are in early stages,    \nthere are significant factual or legal issues \nto be resolved, damages are unspecified or    \nuncertain, or there is uncertainty as to a    \nlitigation class being certified or the       \noutcome of pending motions, appeals or        \nproceedings. For those litigation and         \nregulatory matters where the Company has      \ninformation to develop an estimate or range of\nloss, the Company believes the upper end of   \nthe range of reasonably possible losses in    \naggregate, in excess of any reserves          \nestablished for matters where a loss is       \nconsidered probable, will not be material to  \nits financial condition, results of operations\nor cash flows. The Company\u2019s estimates are    \nsubject to significant judgment and           \nuncertainties, and the matters underlying the \nestimates will change from time to time.      \nActual results may vary significantly from the\ncurrent estimates.                            \n                                 \n  Note\u00a0\u00a017    Business Segments  \n                                 \nWithin the Company, financial performance is  \nmeasured by major lines of business based on  \nthe products and services provided to         \ncustomers through its distribution channels.  \nThese operating segments are components of the\nCompany about which financial information is  \nprepared and is evaluated regularly by        \nmanagement in deciding how to allocate        \nresources and assess performance. The Company \nhas five reportable operating segments:       \nCorporate and Commercial Banking Corporate and\nCommercial Banking offers lending, equipment  \nfinance and small-ticket leasing, depository  \nservices, treasury management, capital markets\nservices, international trade services and    \nother financial services to middle market,    \nlarge corporate, commercial real estate,      \nfinancial institution, non-profitand public   \nsector clients.                               \nConsumer and Business Banking Consumer and    \nBusiness Banking comprises consumer banking,  \nsmall business banking and consumer lending.  \nProducts and services are delivered through   \nbanking offices, telephone servicing and      \nsales, on-lineservices, direct mail, ATM      \nprocessing, mobile devices, distributed       \nmortgage loan officers, and intermediary      \nrelationships including auto dealerships,     \nmortgage banks, and strategic business        \npartners.                                     \n                      \n  70    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nWealth Management and Investment Services     \nWealth Management and Investment Services     \nprovides private banking, financial advisory  \nservices, investment management, retail       \nbrokerage services, insurance, trust, custody \nand fund servicing through four businesses:   \nWealth Management, Global Corporate Trust &   \nCustody, U.S. Bancorp Asset Management and    \nFund Services. Payment Services Payment       \nServices includes consumer and business credit\ncards, stored-value cards, debit cards,       \ncorporate, government and purchasing card     \nservices, consumer lines of credit and        \nmerchant processing. Treasury and Corporate   \nSupport Treasury and Corporate Support        \nincludes the Company\u2019s investment portfolios, \nfunding, capital management, interest rate    \nrisk management, income taxes not allocated to\nbusiness segments, including most investments \nin tax-advantagedprojects, and the residual   \naggregate of those expenses associated with   \ncorporate activities that are managed on a    \nconsolidated basis. Basis of Presentation     \nBusiness segment results are derived from the \nCompany\u2019s business unit profitability         \nreporting systems by specifically attributing \nmanaged balance sheet assets, deposits and    \nother liabilities and their related income or \nexpense. The allowance for credit losses and  \nrelated provision expense are allocated to the\nbusiness segments according to the volume and \ncredit quality of the loan balances managed,  \nbut with the impact of changes in economic    \nforecasts recorded in Treasury and Corporate  \nSupport. Goodwill and other intangible assets \nare assigned to the business segments based on\nthe mix of business of an entity acquired by  \nthe Company. Within the Company, capital      \nlevels are evaluated and managed centrally;   \nhowever, capital is allocated to the business \nsegments to support evaluation of business    \nperformance. Business segments are allocated  \ncapital on a risk-adjusted basis considering  \neconomic and regulatory capital requirements. \nGenerally, the determination of the amount of \ncapital allocated to each business segment    \nincludes credit allocations following a Basel \nIII regulatory framework. Interest income and \nexpense is determined based on the assets and \nliabilities managed by the business segment.  \nBecause funding and asset/liability management\nis a central function, funds transfer-pricing \nmethodologies are utilized to allocate a cost \nof funds used or credit for funds provided to \nall business segment assets and liabilities,  \nrespectively, using a matched funding concept.\nAlso, each business unit is allocated the     \ntaxable-equivalent benefit of tax-            \nexemptproducts. The residual effect on net    \ninterest income of asset/ liability management\nactivities is included in Treasury and        \nCorporate Support. Noninterest income and     \nexpenses directly managed by each business    \nsegment, including fees, service charges,     \nsalaries and benefits, and other direct       \nrevenues and costs are accounted for within   \neach segment\u2019s financial results in a manner  \nsimilar to the consolidated financial         \nstatements. Occupancy costs are allocated     \nbased on utilization of facilities by the     \nbusiness segments. Generally, operating losses\nare charged to the business segment when the  \nloss event is realized in a manner similar to \na loan charge-off.Noninterest expenses        \nincurred by centrally managed operations or   \nbusiness segments that directly support       \nanother business segment\u2019s operations are     \ncharged to the applicable business segment    \nbased on its utilization of those services,   \nprimarily measured by the volume of customer  \nactivities, number of employees or other      \nrelevant factors. These allocated expenses are\nreported as net shared services expense within\nnoninterest expense. Certain activities that  \ndo not directly support the operations of the \nbusiness segments or for which the business   \nsegments are not considered financially       \naccountable in evaluating their performance   \nare not charged to the business segments. The \nincome or expenses associated with these      \ncorporate activities, including merger and    \nintegration charges, are reported within the  \nTreasury and Corporate Support business       \nsegment. Income taxes are assessed to each    \nbusiness segment at a standard tax rate with  \nthe residual tax expense or benefit to arrive \nat the consolidated effective tax rate        \nincluded in Treasury and Corporate Support.   \nDesignations, assignments and allocations     \nchange from time to time as management systems\nare enhanced, methods of evaluating           \nperformance or product lines change or        \nbusiness segments are realigned to better     \nrespond to the Company\u2019s diverse customer     \nbase. During 2022, certain organization and   \nmethodology changes were made and,            \naccordingly, 2021 results were restated and   \npresented on a comparable basis.              \n
