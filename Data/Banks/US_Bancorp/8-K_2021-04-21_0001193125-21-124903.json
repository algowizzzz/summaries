To clarify the statements made  \nat the annual meeting, the Company\u2019s long-term\nnet income growth expectation is 5% to 7% and \nits long-term EPS growth expectation is 7% to \n10%, as previously disclosed at the Company\u2019s \nInvestor Day in September 2019. As discussed  \nduring the meeting, these goals represent the \nCompany\u2019s long-term expectations under        \nnormalized economic conditions. The           \ninformation in this Item 7.01, is being       \nfurnished and shall not be deemed \u201cfiled\u201d for \nthe purposes of Section 18 of the Securities  \nExchange Act of 1934 or otherwise subject to  \nthe liabilities of that Section. The          \ninformation in this Item 7.01, shall not be   \nincorporated by reference into any            \nregistration statement or other document      \npursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, except\nas otherwise expressly stated in such filing. \nForward-looking statements \u201cSafe Harbor\u201d      \nStatement under the Private Securities        \nLitigation Reform Act of 1995: This Form      \n8-Kcontains forward-looking statements about  \nU.S. Bancorp. Statements that are not         \nhistorical or current facts, including        \nstatements about beliefs and expectations, are\nforward-looking statements and are based on   \nthe information available to, and assumptions \nand estimates made by, management as of the   \ndate hereof. The forward-looking statements   \ncontained in this Form 8-Kinclude, among other\nthings, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s long-term net income   \nand EPS growth expectations. There can be no  \nassurance that U.S. Bancorp will achieve these\nexpectations in the future. These forward-    \nlooking statements cover, among other things, \nanticipated future revenue and expenses and   \nthe future plans and prospects of U.S.        \nBancorp. Forward-looking statements involve   \ninherent risks and uncertainties, and         \nimportant factors could cause actual results  \nto differ materially from those anticipated.  \nThe COVID-19 pandemicis adversely affecting   \nU.S. Bancorp, its customers, counterparties,  \nemployees, and third-party service providers, \nand the ultimate extent of the impacts on its \nbusiness, financial position, results of      \noperations, liquidity, and prospects is       \nuncertain. Continued deterioration in general \nbusiness and economic conditions or turbulence\nin domestic or global financial markets could \nadversely affect U.S. Bancorp\u2019s revenues and  \nthe values of its assets and liabilities,     \nreduce the availability of funding to certain \nfinancial institutions, lead to a tightening  \nof credit, and increase stock price           \nvolatility. In addition, changes to statutes, \nregulations, or regulatory policies or        \npractices could affect U.S. Bancorp in        \nsubstantial and unpredictable ways. U.S.      \nBancorp\u2019s results could also be adversely     \naffected by changes in interest rates; further\nincreases in unemployment rates; deterioration\nin the credit quality of its loan portfolios  \nor in the value of the collateral securing    \nthose loans; deterioration in the value of its\ninvestment securities; legal and regulatory   \ndevelopments; litigation; increased           \ncompetition from both banks and non-banks;    \ncivilunrest; changes in customer behavior and \npreferences; breaches in data security;       \nfailures to safeguard personal information;   \neffects of mergers and acquisitions and       \nrelated integration; effects of critical      \naccounting policies and judgments; and        \nmanagement\u2019s ability to effectively manage    \ncredit risk, market risk, operational risk,   \ncompliance risk, strategic risk, interest rate\nrisk, liquidity risk and reputation risk. For \ndiscussion of these and other risks that may  \ncause actual results to differ from           \nexpectations, refer to U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Annual  \nReport on Form 10-K forthe year ended December\n31, 2020, on file with the Securities and     \nExchange Commission, including the sections   \nentitled \u201cCorporate Risk Profile\u201d and \u201cRisk   \nFactors\u201d contained in Exhibit 13, and all     \nsubsequent filings with the Securities and    \nExchange Commission under Sections 13(a),     \n13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange \nAct of 1934. In addition, factors other than  \nthese risks also could adversely affect U.S.  \nBancorp\u2019s results, and the reader should not  \nconsider these risks to be a complete set of  \nall potential risks or uncertainties. Forward-\nlooking statements speak only as of the date  \nhereof, and U.S. Bancorp undertakes no        \nobligation to update them in light of new     \ninformation or future events. 3               \n                                              \n  Item\u00a09.01  Financial Statements and         \n             Exhibits.                        \n                                              \n(d) Exhibits.                                 \n                                              \n         Cover Page Interactive Data File     \n  104    (embedded within the Inline XBRL     \n         document)                            \n                                              \n4                                             \n                                              \nSIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, the          \nregistrant has duly caused this report to be  \nsigned on its behalf by the undersigned       \nhereunto duly authorized.                     \n                                              \n       U.S. BANCORP                           \n  By:                /s/ James L.
