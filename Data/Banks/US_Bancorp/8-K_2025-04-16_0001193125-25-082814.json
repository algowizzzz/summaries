on a Current Report on Form 8-Kfiled\non January 28, 2025, Gunjan Kedia was         \nappointed as the Company\u2019s President and Chief\nExecutive Officer, effective April 15, 2025.  \nAt its meeting on April 15, 2025, the         \nCompany\u2019s Board of Directors determined the   \nbase salary and target annual cash incentive  \naward that Ms. Kedia will receive in          \nrecognition of the additional duties being    \nassumed by her in her new role. Effective as  \nof April 16, 2025, Ms. Kedia will receive an  \nincrease in her base salary to an annualized  \namount of $1,200,000, and she will be eligible\nto receive an annual cash incentive award with\na target value of 275% of her base salary. In \naddition to the 2025 long-term incentive award\nMs. Kedia received on February 27, 2025, which\nwas disclosed in the January Form 8-K,the     \nCompany\u2019s Board of Directors and its          \nCompensation and Human Resources Committee    \ndetermined to award Ms. Kedia an additional   \nlong-term incentive award in the form of      \nperformance-based restricted stock units      \n(\u201cPRSUs\u201d), valued at $1,500,000 as of the     \ngrant date of April 17, 2025, under the U.S.  \nBancorp 2024 Stock Incentive Plan with the    \nstructure and terms of such award to reflect  \nthose previously granted to executive officers\nin 2025. In determining the value of the      \nadditional award, the Compensation and Human  \nResources Committee considered, among other   \nfactors, her official transition to the CEO   \nrole and market pay levels. Detailed          \ninformation about the 2025 PRSU awards granted\nto the Company\u2019s executive officers and other \naspects of the Company\u2019s executive            \ncompensation program can be found in the      \nCompany\u2019s Definitive Proxy Statement on       \nSchedule 14A filed on March 5, 2025. As the   \nCompany previously disclosed in the January   \nForm 8-K,Andrew Cecere, the Company\u2019s former  \nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, is      \ncontinuing his service on the Board as        \nExecutive Chairman, effective following the   \nCompany\u2019s annual shareholders\u2019 meeting on     \nApril 15, 2025. At its meeting on April 15,   \n2025, the Board determined the terms of the   \ncompensation Mr. Cecere will receive as       \nExecutive Chairman. Effective as of April 16, \n2025, Mr. Cecere will receive a base salary   \nwith an annualized amount of $1,400,000.      \nEffective April 15, 2025, the Board also      \napproved an amendment to the U.S. Bank Non-   \nQualifiedRetirement Plan prior to Mr. Cecere\u2019s\ntransition to the Executive Chairman role. As \ndescribed in the \u201cPension benefits\u201d section of\nthe Company\u2019s 2025 Proxy Statement, Mr. Cecere\nis fully vested in his supplemental benefit   \nunder the plan. The amendment freezes Mr.     \nCecere\u2019s supplemental benefit under the plan  \nas of April 15, 2025. In addition, the        \namendment specifies that Mr. Cecere\u2019s         \nsupplemental benefit, which will be paid in a \nlump sum in accordance with his prior         \nelection, will be calculated using the lump   \nsum actuarial equivalent interest rate and    \nmortality table in effect as of the freeze    \ndate. The terms of the plan as they apply to  \nMr. Cecere are not otherwise amended, and the \namendment does not affect Mr. Cecere\u2019s earned \nbenefit under the U.S. Bancorp Cash Balance   \nPension Plan that will be part of his total   \nretirement benefit as described in the        \n\u201cPension benefits\u201d section of the Company\u2019s   \n2025 Proxy Statement. The amendment does not  \naffect any other plan participants. Additional\ninformation about the estimated amount and    \ncalculation of Mr. Cecere\u2019s supplemental      \nbenefit under the Non-QualifiedRetirement Plan\nis included in the \u201cPension benefits\u201d section \nof the Company\u2019s 2025 Proxy Statement.
