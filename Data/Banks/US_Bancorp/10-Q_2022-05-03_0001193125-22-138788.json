The        \nCOVID-19pandemic is adversely affecting U.S.  \nBancorp, its customers, counterparties,       \nemployees, and third-party service providers, \nand the ultimate extent of the impacts on its \nbusiness, financial position, results of      \noperations, liquidity, and prospects is       \nuncertain. Continued deterioration in general \nbusiness and economic conditions or turbulence\nin domestic or global financial markets could \nadversely affect U.S. Bancorp\u2019s revenues and  \nthe values of its assets and liabilities,     \nreduce the availability of funding to certain \nfinancial institutions, lead to a tightening  \nof credit, and increase stock price           \nvolatility. In addition, changes to statutes, \nregulations, or regulatory policies or        \npractices could affect U.S. Bancorp in        \nsubstantial and unpredictable ways. U.S.      \nBancorp\u2019s results could also be adversely     \naffected by changes in interest rates;        \nincreases in unemployment rates; deterioration\nin the credit quality of its loan portfolios  \nor in the value of the collateral securing    \nthose loans; deterioration in the value of its\ninvestment securities; legal and regulatory   \ndevelopments; litigation; increased           \ncompetition from both banks and non-          \nbanks;civil unrest; the effects of climate    \nchange; changes in customer behavior and      \npreferences; breaches in data security,       \nincluding as a result of work-from-home       \narrangements; failures to safeguard personal  \ninformation; the impacts of international     \nhostilities or geopolitical events; effects of\nmergers and acquisitions and related          \nintegration; effects of critical accounting   \npolicies and judgments; and management\u2019s      \nability to effectively manage credit risk,    \nmarket risk, operational risk, compliance     \nrisk, strategic risk, interest rate risk,     \nliquidity risk and reputation risk. In        \naddition, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s proposed acquisition \nof MUFG Union Bank presents risks and         \nuncertainties, including, among others: the   \nrisk that the cost savings, any revenue       \nsynergies and other anticipated benefits of   \nthe proposed acquisition may not be realized  \nor may take longer than anticipated to be     \nrealized; the risk that U.S. Bancorp\u2019s        \nbusiness could be disrupted as a result of the\nannouncement and pendency of the proposed     \nacquisition and diversion of management\u2019s     \nattention from ongoing business operations and\nopportunities; the possibility that the       \nproposed acquisition, including the           \nintegration of MUFG Union Bank, may be more   \ncostly or difficult to complete than          \nanticipated; delays in closing the proposed   \nacquisition; and the failure of required      \ngovernmental approvals to be obtained or any  \nother closing conditions in the definitive    \npurchase agreement to be satisfied.

OVERVIEW \nEarnings Summary U.S. Bancorp and its         \nsubsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) reported net     \nincome attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $1.6   \nbillion for the first quarter of 2022, or     \n$0.99 per diluted common share, compared with \n$2.3 billion, or $1.45 per diluted common     \nshare, for the first quarter of 2021. Return  \non average assets and return on average common\nequity were 1.09 percent and 12.7 percent,    \nrespectively, for the first quarter of 2022,  \ncompared with 1.69 percent and 19.0 percent,  \nrespectively, for the first quarter of 2021.  \nTotal net revenue for the first quarter of    \n2022 was $126 million (2.3 percent) higher    \nthan the first quarter of 2021, reflecting a  \n3.6 percent increase in net interest income   \nand a 0.6 percent increase in noninterest     \nincome. The increase in net interest income   \nfrom the first quarter of 2021 was primarily  \ndue to higher loan and investment securities  \nbalances and favorable deposit and funding mix\ndue in part to higher noninterest-bearing     \ndeposits, partially offset by lower loan      \nyields and changes in loan mix, as well as    \nlower loan fees driven by the impact of loan  \nforgiveness related to the Small Business     \nAdministration (\u201cSBA\u201d) Paycheck Protection    \nProgram in the first quarter of 2021. The     \nnoninterest income increase primarily         \nreflected stronger payment services revenue,  \ntrust and investment management fees, deposit \nservice charges and treasury management fees, \nmostly offset by lower mortgage banking       \nrevenue as refinancing activities decline,    \nlower commercial products revenue related to  \ncapital markets activities and lower other    \nnoninterest income. Noninterest expense in the\nfirst quarter of 2022 was $123 million (3.6   \npercent) higher than the first quarter of     \n2021, reflecting increases in compensation    \nexpense, professional services expense and    \nmarketing and business development expense.   \nThe provision for credit losses for the first \nquarter of 2022 was $112 million, compared    \nwith a benefit of $827 million for the first  \nquarter of 2021. The provision for credit     \nlosses in the first quarter of 2022 reflected \nthe impact of improving credit quality,       \npartially offset by loan growth and increasing\neconomic uncertainty. The provision for credit\nlosses for the first quarter of 2021 reflected\na decrease in the allowance for credit losses \nas a result of improving economic conditions  \nand credit quality. Net charge-offs in the    \nfirst quarter of 2022 were $162 million,      \ncompared with $223 million in the first       \nquarter of 2021. Refer to \u201cCorporate Risk     \nProfile\u201d for further information on the       \nprovision for credit losses, net charge-offs, \nnonperforming assets and other factors        \nconsidered by the Company in assessing the    \ncredit quality of the loan portfolio and      \nestablishing the allowance for credit losses. \nPending Acquisition In September 2021, the    \nCompany announced that it entered into a      \ndefinitive agreement to acquire MUFG Union    \nBank\u2019s core regional banking franchise from   \nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (\u201cMUFG\u201d), for  \nan expected purchase price of approximately   \n$8.0 billion, including $5.5 billion in cash  \nand approximately 44 million shares of U.S.   \nBancorp common stock. The transaction excludes\nthe purchase of MUFG Union Bank\u2019s Global      \nCorporate & Investment Bank, certain middle   \nand back office functions, and other assets.  \nMUFG Union Bank currently has approximately   \n300 branches in California, Washington and    \nOregon and is expected to add approximately   \n$105 billion in total assets, $58 billion of  \nloans and $90 billion of deposits to the      \nCompany\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. Closing \nof the transaction is subject to customary    \nclosing conditions, including regulatory      \napprovals which are not within the Company\u2019s  \ncontrol. The Company expects to close the     \ntransaction approximately 45 days after being \ngranted U.S. regulatory approvals. At this    \ntime, it is uncertain whether such approvals  \nwill be received in time to allow for closing \nto occur in the first half of 2022; however,  \nthe parties continue to make significant      \nprogress in planning for closing and          \nintegration while awaiting regulatory         \napprovals. STATEMENT OF INCOME ANALYSIS Net   \nInterest Income Net interest income, on a     \ntaxable-equivalent basis, was $3.2 billion in \nthe first quarter of 2022, representing an    \nincrease of $111 million (3.6 percent)        \ncompared with the first quarter of 2021. The  \nincrease was primarily due to higher loan and \ninvestment securities balances and favorable  \ndeposit and funding mix due in part to higher \nnoninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset\nby lower loan yields and changes in loan mix, \nas well as lower loan fees driven by the      \nimpact of loan forgiveness related to the SBA \nPaycheck Protection Program in the first      \nquarter of 2021. Average earning assets were  \n$32.1 billion (6.5 percent) higher than the   \nfirst quarter of 2021, reflecting increases of\n$29.2 billion (20.1 percent) in investment    \nsecurities and $19.0 billion (6.5 percent) in \nloans, partially offset by a decrease of $11.9\nbillion (28.6 percent) in interest-bearing    \ndeposits with banks. The net interest margin, \non a taxable-equivalent basis, in the first   \nquarter of 2022 was 2.44 percent, compared    \nwith 2.50 percent in the first quarter of     \n2021. The decrease in net interest margin from\nthe first quarter of 2021 was primarily due to\nthe mix of loans and lower loan spreads within\nfixed-rate portfolios, partially offset by    \nfavorable changes in funding mix and the yield\ncurve.

The increase  \nwas primarily due to growth in commercial     \nloans (11.4 percent), residential mortgages   \n(3.0 percent) and other retail loans (8.8     \npercent). The increase in commercial loans was\nprimarily due to higher utilization driven by \nworking capital needs of corporate customers  \nand slower payoffs given higher volatility in \nthe capital markets, as well as core growth,  \npartially offset by expected reductions       \nrelated to the forgiveness of loans in the SBA\nPaycheck Protection Program. The increase in  \nresidential mortgages was driven by stronger  \non-balancesheet loan activities and slower    \nrefinance activity. The increase in other     \nretail loans was driven by auto and           \nrecreational vehicle lending during 2021,     \npartially offset by lower home equity and     \nsecond mortgages. Average investment          \nsecurities in the first quarter of 2022 were  \n$29.2 billion (20.1 percent) higher than the  \nfirst quarter of 2021, primarily due to       \npurchases of mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury\nsecurities, net of prepayments, sales and     \nmaturities. Average total deposits for the    \nfirst quarter of 2022 were $27.8 billion (6.5 \npercent) higher than the first quarter of     \n2021. Average total savings deposits for the  \nfirst quarter of 2022 were $20.6 billion (7.3 \npercent) higher than the first quarter of     \n2021, driven by increases in Consumer and     \nBusiness Banking, and Corporate and Commercial\nBanking balances, partially offset by a       \ndecrease in Wealth Management and Investment  \nServices balances. Average noninterest-bearing\ndeposits were $9.6 billion (8.1 percent)      \nhigher than the prior year, primarily due to  \nhigher Corporate and Commercial Banking, and  \nWealth Management and Investment Services     \nbalances. Average time deposits were $2.4     \nbillion (8.8 percent) lower than the prior    \nyear, primarily driven by decreases in        \nConsumer and Business Banking, and Wealth     \nManagement and Investment Services balances,  \npartially offset by an increase in Corporate  \nand Commercial Banking balances. Changes in   \ntime deposits are primarily related to those  \ndeposits managed as an alternative to other   \nfunding sources, based largely on relative    \npricing and liquidity characteristics.        \nProvision for Credit Losses The provision for \ncredit losses was $112 million for the first  \nquarter of 2022, compared with a benefit of   \n$827 million for the first quarter of 2021.   \nThe provision for credit losses in the first  \nquarter of 2022 reflected the impact of       \nimproving credit quality, partially offset by \nloan growth and increasing economic           \nuncertainty associated with rising inflation  \nand geopolitical tensions. The provision for  \ncredit losses in the first quarter of 2021    \nreflected the enactment of additional         \ngovernment stimulus programs and widespread   \nvaccine availability, contributing to economic\nimprovement during the period, which resulted \nin a significant decrease in the allowance for\ncredit losses. Net charge-offs decreased $61  \nmillion (27.4 percent) in the first quarter of\n2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021,\nreflecting improvement across most loan       \ncategories, associated with strong asset      \nvalues and borrower liquidity. Refer to       \n\u201cCorporate Risk Profile\u201d for further          \ninformation on the provision for credit       \nlosses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets \nand other factors considered by the Company in\nassessing the credit quality of the loan      \nportfolio and establishing the allowance for  \ncredit losses. Noninterest Income Noninterest \nincome was $2.4 billion in the first quarter  \nof 2022, representing an increase of $15      \nmillion (0.6 percent) compared with the first \nquarter of 2021. The increase from a year ago \nreflected strong payment services revenue,    \ngrowth in trust and investment management     \nfees, improving deposit service charges and   \nhigher treasury management fees, mostly offset\nby lower commercial products revenue, mortgage\nbanking revenue and other noninterest income. \nPayment services revenue increased $79 million\n(10.1 percent) as corporate payment products  \nrevenue increased $32 million (25.4 percent)  \nprimarily due to higher sales volume, while   \nmerchant processing services revenue increased\n$45 million                                   \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    5  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                  \n  Table\u00a03    Noninterest Expense  \n                                  \n                                              \n            Thr\u2026                              \n            Mon\u2026                              \n            End\u2026                              \n  (D\u2026       Mar\u2026                              \n  in          31                     Per\u2026     \n  Mi\u2026       2022          2021       Cha\u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Co\u2026    $  1,8\u2026       $  1,8\u2026        2.8  %  \n  Em\u2026        396           384        3.1     \n  be\u2026                                         \n  Net                                         \n  oc\u2026        269           263        2.3     \n  and                                         \n  eq\u2026                                         \n  Pr\u2026        114            98       16.3     \n  se\u2026                                         \n  Ma\u2026                                         \n  and         80            48       66.7     \n  bu\u2026                                         \n  de\u2026                                         \n  Te\u2026                                         \n  and        349           359       (2.8  )  \n  co\u2026                                         \n  Po\u2026                                         \n  pr\u2026         72            69        4.3     \n  and                                         \n  su\u2026                                         \n  Ot\u2026         47            38       23.7     \n  in\u2026                                         \n  Ot\u2026        322           317        1.6     \n  To\u2026                                         \n  no\u2026    $  3,5\u2026       $  3,3\u2026        3.6  %  \n  ex\u2026                                         \n  Ef\u2026                                         \n  ra\u2026       62.8  %       62.1  %             \n  (a)                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  (a)  SeeNon-GAAPFinancial Measures          \n       beginning on page\u00a030.                  \n                                              \n(14.2 percent) driven by higher sales volumes \nand merchant fees.

Deposit service charges\nincreased $16 million (9.9 percent) primarily \ndue to higher customer spend activity, net of \nthe impact of the elimination of certain      \nconsumer non-sufficientfunds fees in the first\nquarter of 2022. Treasury management fees     \nincreased $9 million (6.1 percent) primarily  \ndue to core growth given the continued        \nrecovery in the economy. Mortgage banking     \nrevenue decreased $99 million (33.1 percent)  \ndue to lower application volume, given        \ndeclining refinance activities, and lower     \nrelated gain on sale margins, partially offset\nby increases in mortgage servicing rights     \n(\u201cMSRs\u201d) valuations, net of hedging           \nactivities, as well as higher performing loan \nsales. Commercial products revenue decreased  \n$14 million (5.0 percent) primarily due to    \nlower corporate bond fees and trading revenue \nwithin the capital markets business. Other    \nnoninterest income decreased $32 million (16.8\npercent) driven by the impact of prior year   \nasset sales and lower retail leasing end-of-  \ntermresidual gains in the first quarter of    \n2022. Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense \nwas $3.5 billion in the first quarter of 2022,\nrepresenting an increase of $123 million (3.6 \npercent) over the first quarter of 2021. The  \nincrease from the prior year reflected higher \ncompensation expense, professional services   \nexpense and marketing and business development\nexpense. Compensation expense increased $50   \nmillion (2.8 percent) primarily due to merit  \nincreases and hiring to support business      \ngrowth, partially offset by lower performance-\nbased incentives. Professional services       \nexpense increased $16 million (16.3 percent)  \nprimarily due to an increase in business      \ninvestment and related initiatives. Marketing \nand business development expense increased $32\nmillion (66.7 percent) due to the timing of   \nmarketing campaigns as well as increased      \ntravel and entertainment. Income Tax Expense  \nThe provision for income taxes was $397       \nmillion (an effective rate of 20.3 percent)   \nfor the first quarter of 2022, compared with  \n$607 million (an effective rate of 21.0       \npercent) for the first quarter of 2021.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS Loans The  \nCompany\u2019s loan portfolio was $318.9 billion at\nMarch 31, 2022, compared with $312.0 billion  \nat December 31, 2021, an increase of $6.9     \nbillion (2.2 percent). The increase was driven\nby higher commercial loans and residential    \nmortgages, partially offset by lower credit   \ncard loans and other retail loans. Commercial \nloans increased $5.4 billion (4.9 percent) at \nMarch 31, 2022, compared with December 31,    \n2021, due to higher utilization driven by     \nworking capital needs of corporate customers  \nand slower payoffs given higher volatility in \nthe capital markets, as well as core growth.  \nResidential mortgages held in the loan        \nportfolio increased $2.0 billion (2.6 percent)\nat March 31, 2022, compared with December 31, \n2021, due to stronger on-balancesheet loan    \nactivities and slower refinance activity.     \nResidential mortgages originated and placed in\nthe Company\u2019s loan portfolio include jumbo    \nmortgages and branch-originated first lien    \nhome equity loans to borrowers with high      \ncredit quality. Credit card loans decreased   \n$337 million (1.5 percent) at March 31, 2022, \ncompared with December 31, 2021, primarily the\nresult of customers seasonally paying down    \nbalances.                                     \n                     \n  6    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                    \n  Table\u00a04    Investment Securities  \n                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Information related to asset and       \n       mortgage-backed securities included    \n  (a)  above is presented based upon          \n       weighted-average maturities that take  \n       into account anticipated future        \n       prepayments.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Information related to obligations of  \n       state and political subdivisions is    \n       presented based upon yield to first    \n  (b)  optional call date if the security is  \n       purchased at a premium, and yield to   \n       maturity if the security is purchased  \n       at par or a discount.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Maturity calculations for obligations  \n       of state and political subdivisions    \n       are based on the first optional call   \n  (c)  date for securities with a fair value  \n       above par and the contractual          \n       maturity date for securities with a    \n       fair value equal to or below par.      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Yields on investment securities are    \n       computed based on amortized cost       \n       balances.

If the Company\u2019s    \nintent or ability to hold an existing         \nportfolio loan changes, it is transferred to  \nloans held for sale. Loans Held for Sale Loans\nheld for sale, consisting primarily of        \nresidential mortgages to be sold in the       \nsecondary market, were $3.3 billion at March  \n31, 2022, compared with $7.8 billion at       \nDecember 31, 2021. The decrease in loans held \nfor sale was principally due to a lower level \nof mortgage loan closings in the first quarter\nof 2022, compared with the fourth quarter of  \n2021. Almost all of the residential mortgage  \nloans the Company originates or purchases for \nsale follow guidelines that allow the loans to\nbe sold into existing, highly liquid secondary\nmarkets, in particular in government agency   \ntransactions and to government-sponsored      \nenterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d). Investment Securities   \nInvestment securities totaled $167.2 billion  \nat March 31, 2022, compared with $174.8       \nbillion at December 31, 2021. The $7.6 billion\n(4.3 percent) decrease was primarily due to a \n$6.8 billion unfavorable change in net        \nunrealized gains (losses) on available-for-   \nsaleinvestment securities. The Company\u2019s      \navailable-for-saleinvestment securities are   \ncarried at fair value with changes in fair    \nvalue reflected in other comprehensive income \n(loss) unless a portion of a security\u2019s       \nunrealized loss is related to credit and an   \nallowance for credit losses is necessary. At  \nMarch 31, 2022, the Company\u2019s net unrealized  \nlosses on available-for-saleinvestment        \nsecurities were $6.0 billion, compared with   \n$722 million of net unrealized gains at       \nDecember 31, 2021. The unfavorable change in  \nnet unrealized gains (losses) was primarily   \ndue to decreases in the fair value of         \nmortgage-backed, U.S. Treasury and state and  \npolitical securities as a result of changes in\ninterest rates. Gross unrealized losses on    \navailable-for-saleinvestment securities       \ntotaled $6.3 billion at March 31, 2022,       \ncompared with $812 million at December 31,    \n2021. At March 31, 2022, the Company had no   \nplans to sell securities with unrealized      \nlosses, and believes it is more likely than   \nnot that it would not be required to sell such\nsecurities before recovery of their amortized \ncost. Refer to Notes 4 and 15 in the Notes to \nConsolidated Financial Statements for further \ninformation on investment securities.         \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    7  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nDeposits Total deposits were $461.5 billion at\nMarch 31, 2022, compared with $456.1 billion  \nat December 31, 2021. The $5.5 billion (1.2   \npercent) increase in total deposits reflected \nincreases in total savings deposits and time  \ndeposits, partially offset by a decrease in   \nnoninterest-bearing deposits. Money market    \ndeposit balances increased $3.7 billion (3.2  \npercent) at March 31, 2022, compared with     \nDecember 31, 2021, primarily due to higher    \nCorporate and Commercial Banking, and Wealth  \nManagement and Investment Services balances.  \nSavings account balances increased $2.6       \nbillion (4.0 percent), driven by higher       \nConsumer and Business Banking balances.       \nInterest checking balances increased $2.6     \nbillion (2.2 percent), primarily due to higher\nCorporate and Commercial Banking, and Consumer\nand Business Banking balances, partially      \noffset by a decrease in Wealth Management and \nInvestment Services balances. Time deposits   \nincreased $1.6 billion (7.2 percent) at March \n31, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021,    \ndriven by higher Corporate and Commercial     \nBanking balances, partially offset by lower   \nConsumer and Business Banking balances.       \nChanges in time deposits are primarily related\nto those deposits managed as an alternative to\nother funding sources, based largely on       \nrelative pricing and liquidity                \ncharacteristics. Noninterest-bearing deposits \ndecreased $5.1 billion (3.8 percent) at March \n31, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021,    \nprimarily due to lower Wealth Management and  \nInvestment Services balances. Borrowings The  \nCompany utilizes both short-term and long-term\nborrowings as part of its asset/liability     \nmanagement and funding strategies. Short-term \nborrowings, which include federal funds       \npurchased, commercial paper, repurchase       \nagreements, borrowings secured by high-grade  \nassets and other short-term borrowings, were  \n$21.0 billion at March 31, 2022, compared with\n$11.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The $9.2  \nbillion (78.4 percent) increase in short-term \nborrowings was primarily due to an increase in\nshort-termFederal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d)     \nadvances. Long-term debt was $32.9 billion at \nMarch 31, 2022, compared with $32.1 billion at\nDecember 31, 2021. The $806 million (2.5      \npercent) increase was primarily due to $2.1   \nbillion of medium-term note issuances,        \npartially offset by $1.0 billion of medium-   \nterm note repayments.

The Company\u2019s   \nBoard of Directors has approved a risk        \nmanagement framework which establishes        \ngovernance and risk management requirements   \nfor all risk-taking activities. This framework\nincludes Company and business line risk       \nappetite statements which set boundaries for  \nthe types and amount of risk that may be      \nundertaken in pursuing business objectives and\ninitiatives. The Board of Directors, primarily\nthrough its Risk Management Committee,        \noversees performance relative to the risk     \nmanagement framework, risk appetite           \nstatements, and other policy requirements. The\nExecutive Risk Committee (\u201cERC\u201d), which is    \nchaired by the Chief Risk Officer and includes\nthe Chief Executive Officer and other members \nof the executive management team, oversees    \nexecution against the risk management         \nframework and risk appetite statements. The   \nERC focuses on current and emerging risks,    \nincluding strategic and reputation risks, by  \ndirecting timely and comprehensive actions.   \nSenior operating committees have also been    \nestablished, each responsible for overseeing a\nspecified category of risk. The Company\u2019s most\nprominent risk exposures are credit, interest \nrate, market, liquidity, operational,         \ncompliance, strategic, and reputation. Credit \nrisk is the risk of loss associated with a    \nchange in the credit profile or the failure of\na borrower or counterparty to meet its        \ncontractual obligations. Interest rate risk is\nthe current or prospective risk to earnings   \nand capital, or market valuations, arising    \nfrom the impact of changes in interest rates. \nMarket risk arises from fluctuations in       \ninterest rates, foreign exchange rates, and   \nsecurity prices that may result in changes in \nthe values of financial instruments, such as  \ntrading and available-for-salesecurities,     \nmortgage loans held for sale (\u201cMLHFS\u201d), MSRs  \nand derivatives that are accounted for on a   \nfair value basis. Liquidity risk is the risk  \nthat financial condition or overall safety and\nsoundness is adversely affected by the        \nCompany\u2019s inability, or perceived inability,  \nto meet its cash flow obligations in a timely \nand complete manner in either normal or       \nstressed conditions. Operational risk is the  \nrisk to current or projected financial        \ncondition and resilience arising from         \ninadequate or failed internal processes or    \nsystems, people (including human errors or    \nmisconduct), or adverse external events,      \nincluding the risk of loss resulting from     \nbreaches in data security. Operational risk   \ncan also include the risk of loss due to      \nfailures by third parties with which the      \nCompany does business. Compliance risk is the \nrisk that the Company may suffer legal or     \nregulatory sanctions, financial losses, and   \nreputational damage if it fails to adhere to  \ncompliance requirements and the Company\u2019s     \ncompliance policies. Strategic risk is the    \nrisk to current or projected financial        \ncondition and resilience arising from adverse \nbusiness decisions, poor implementation of    \nbusiness decisions, or lack of responsiveness \nto changes in the banking industry and        \noperating environment. Reputation risk is the \nrisk to current or anticipated earnings,      \ncapital, or franchise or enterprise value     \narising from negative public opinion. This    \nrisk may impair the Company\u2019s competitiveness \nby affecting its ability to establish new     \nrelationships or services, or continue serving\nexisting relationships. In addition to the    \nrisks identified above, other risk factors    \nexist that may impact the Company. Refer to   \n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report \non Form 10-Kfor the year ended December 31,   \n2021, for a detailed discussion of these      \nfactors. The Company\u2019s Board and management-  \nlevel governance committees are supported by a\n\u201cthree lines of defense\u201d model for            \nestablishing effective checks and balances.   \nThe first line of defense, the business lines,\nmanages risks in conformity with established  \nlimits and policy requirements. In turn,      \nbusiness line leaders and their risk officers \nestablish programs to ensure conformity with  \nthese limits and policy requirements. The     \nsecond line of defense, which includes the    \nChief Risk Officer\u2019s organization as well as  \npolicy and oversight activities of corporate  \nsupport functions, translates risk appetite   \nand strategy into actionable risk limits and  \npolicies. The second line of defense monitors \nfirst line of defense conformity with limits  \nand policies, and provides reporting and      \nescalation of emerging risks and other        \nconcerns to senior management and the Risk    \nManagement Committee of the Board of          \nDirectors. The third line of defense, internal\naudit, is responsible for providing the Audit \nCommittee of the Board of Directors and senior\nmanagement with independent assessment and    \nassurance regarding the effectiveness of the  \nCompany\u2019s governance, risk management and     \ncontrol processes.

In  \nevaluating its credit risk, the Company       \nconsiders changes, if any, in underwriting    \nactivities, the loan portfolio composition    \n(including product mix and geographic,        \nindustry or customer-specific concentrations),\ncollateral values, trends in loan performance \nand macroeconomic factors, such as changes in \nunemployment rates, gross domestic product    \nlevels and consumer bankruptcy filings. The   \nRisk Management Committee oversees the        \nCompany\u2019s credit risk management process. In  \naddition, credit quality ratings as defined by\nthe Company are an important part of the      \nCompany\u2019s overall credit risk management and  \nevaluation of its allowance for credit losses.\nLoans with a pass rating represent those loans\nnot classified on the Company\u2019s rating scale  \nfor problem credits, as minimal credit risk   \nhas been identified. Loans with a special     \nmention or classified rating, including       \nconsumer lending and small business loans that\nare 90 days or more past due and still        \naccruing, nonaccrual loans, those loans       \nconsidered troubled debt restructurings       \n(\u201cTDRs\u201d), and loans in a junior lien position \nthat are current but are behind a first lien  \nposition on nonaccrual, encompass all loans   \nheld by the Company that it considers to have \na potential or well-defined weakness that may \nput full collection of contractual cash flows \nat risk. The Company\u2019s internal credit quality\nratings for consumer loans are primarily based\non delinquency and nonperforming status,      \nexcept for a limited population of larger     \nloans within those portfolios that are        \nindividually evaluated. For this limited      \npopulation, the determination of the internal \ncredit quality rating may also consider       \ncollateral value and customer cash flows.     \nRefer to Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated  \nFinancial Statements for further discussion of\nthe Company\u2019s loan portfolios including       \ninternal credit quality ratings. In addition, \nrefer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u2014 Credit Risk Management\u201d in the Company\u2019s    \nAnnual Report on Form 10-Kfor the year ended  \nDecember 31, 2021, for a more detailed        \ndiscussion on credit risk management          \nprocesses. The Company manages its credit     \nrisk, in part, through diversification of its \nloan portfolio which is achieved through limit\nsetting by product type criteria, such as     \nindustry, and identification of credit        \nconcentrations. As part of its normal business\nactivities, the Company offers a broad array  \nof lending products. The Company categorizes  \nits loan portfolio into two segments, which is\nthe level at which it develops and documents a\nsystematic methodology to determine the       \nallowance for credit losses. The Company\u2019s two\nloan portfolio segments are commercial lending\nand consumer lending. The commercial lending  \nsegment includes loans and leases made to     \nsmall business, middle market, large          \ncorporate, commercial real estate, financial  \ninstitution, non-profitand public sector      \ncustomers. Key risk characteristics relevant  \nto commercial lending segment loans include   \nthe industry and geography of the borrower\u2019s  \nbusiness, purpose of the loan, repayment      \nsource, borrower\u2019s debt capacity and financial\nflexibility, loan covenants, and nature of    \npledged collateral, if any, as well as        \nmacroeconomic factors such as unemployment    \nrates, gross domestic product levels,         \ncorporate bond spreads and long-term interest \nrates. These risk characteristics, among      \nothers, are considered in determining         \nestimates about the likelihood of default by  \nthe borrowers and the severity of loss in the \nevent of default. The Company considers these \nrisk characteristics in assigning internal    \nrisk ratings to, or forecasting losses on,    \nthese loans, which are the significant factors\nin determining the allowance for credit losses\nfor loans in the commercial lending segment.  \nThe consumer lending segment represents loans \nand leases made to consumer customers,        \nincluding residential                         \n                      \n  10    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nmortgages, credit card loans, and other retail\nloans such as revolving consumer lines, auto  \nloans and leases, home equity loans and lines,\nand student loans, a run-offportfolio. Home   \nequity or second mortgage loans are junior    \nlien closed-endaccounts fully disbursed at    \norigination. These loans typically are fixed  \nrate loans, secured by residential real       \nestate, with a 10-or 15-yearfixed payment     \namortization schedule. Home equity lines are  \nrevolving accounts giving the borrower the    \nability to draw and repay balances repeatedly,\nup to a maximum commitment, and are secured by\nresidential real estate. These include        \naccounts in either a first or junior lien     \nposition. Typical terms on home equity lines  \nin the portfolio are variable rates           \nbenchmarked to the prime rate, with a 10-or   \n15-yeardraw period during which a minimum     \npayment is equivalent to the monthly interest,\nfollowed by a 20-or 10-yearamortization       \nperiod, respectively. At March 31, 2022,      \nsubstantially all of the Company\u2019s home equity\nlines were in the draw period. Key risk       \ncharacteristics relevant to consumer lending  \nsegment loans primarily relate to the         \nborrowers\u2019 capacity and willingness to repay  \nand include unemployment rates, consumer      \nbankruptcy filings and other macroeconomic    \nfactors, customer payment history and credit  \nscores, and in some cases, updated loan-to-   \nvalue(\u201cLTV\u201d) information reflecting current   \nmarket conditions on real estate-based loans. \nThese and other risk characteristics are      \nreflected in forecasts of delinquency levels, \nbankruptcies and losses which are the primary \nfactors in determining the allowance for      \ncredit losses for the consumer lending        \nsegment. The Company further disaggregates its\nloan portfolio segments into various classes  \nbased on their underlying risk                \ncharacteristics. The two classes within the   \ncommercial lending segment are commercial     \nloans and commercial real estate loans. The   \nthree classes within the consumer lending     \nsegment are residential mortgages, credit card\nloans and other retail loans. The Company\u2019s   \nconsumer lending segment utilizes several     \ndistinct business processes and channels to   \noriginate consumer credit, including          \ntraditional branch lending, mobile and on-    \nlinebanking, indirect lending, alliance       \npartnerships and correspondent banks. Each    \ndistinct underwriting and origination activity\nmanages unique credit risk characteristics and\nprices its loan production commensurate with  \nthe differing risk profiles. Residential      \nmortgage originations are generally limited to\nprime borrowers and are performed through the \nCompany\u2019s branches, loan production offices,  \nmobile and on-lineservices and a wholesale    \nnetwork of originators. The Company may retain\nresidential mortgage loans it originates on   \nits balance sheet or sell the loans into the  \nsecondary market while retaining the servicing\nrights and customer relationships. Utilizing  \nthe secondary markets enables the Company to  \neffectively reduce its credit and other       \nasset/liability risks. For residential        \nmortgages that are retained in the Company\u2019s  \nportfolio and for home equity and second      \nmortgages, credit risk is also diversified by \ngeography and managed by adherence to LTV and \nborrower credit criteria during the           \nunderwriting process. The Company estimates   \nupdated LTV information on its outstanding    \nresidential mortgages quarterly, based on a   \nmethod that combines automated valuation model\nupdates and relevant home price indices. LTV  \nis the ratio of the loan\u2019s outstanding        \nprincipal balance to the current estimate of  \nproperty value. For home equity and second    \nmortgages, combined loan-to-value(\u201cCLTV\u201d) is  \nthe combination of the first mortgage original\nprincipal balance and the second lien         \noutstanding principal balance, relative to the\ncurrent estimate of property value. Certain   \nloans do not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily   \ndue to lack of availability of relevant       \nautomated valuation model and/or home price   \nindices values, or lack of necessary valuation\ndata on acquired loans. The following tables  \nprovide summary information of residential    \nmortgages and home equity and second mortgages\nby LTV at March 31, 2022:                     \n

loan to \nmaximize the collection of amounts due when a \nborrower is experiencing financial            \ndifficulties or is expected to experience     \ndifficulties in the near-term. In most cases  \nthe modification is either a concessionary    \nreduction in interest rate, extension of the  \nmaturity date or reduction in the principal   \nbalance that would otherwise not be           \nconsidered. Troubled Debt Restructurings      \nConcessionary modifications are classified as \nTDRs unless the modification results in only  \nan insignificant delay in the payments to be  \nreceived. TDRs accrue interest if the borrower\ncomplies with the revised terms and conditions\nand has demonstrated repayment performance at \na level commensurate with the modified terms  \nover several payment cycles, which is         \ngenerally six months or greater. At March 31, \n2022 and December 31, 2021, performing TDRs   \nwere $3.1 billion. The Company continues to   \nwork with customers to modify loans for       \nborrowers who are experiencing financial      \ndifficulties. Many of the Company\u2019s TDRs are  \ndetermined on a case-by-casebasis in          \nconnection with ongoing loan collection       \nprocesses. The modifications vary within each \nof the Company\u2019s loan classes. Commercial     \nlending segment TDRs generally include        \nextensions of the maturity date and may be    \naccompanied by an increase or decrease to the \ninterest rate. The Company may also work with \nthe borrower to make other changes to the loan\nto mitigate losses, such as obtaining         \nadditional collateral and/or guarantees to    \nsupport the loan. The Company has also        \nimplemented certain residential mortgage loan \nrestructuring programs that may result in     \nTDRs. The Company modifies residential        \nmortgage loans under Federal Housing          \nAdministration, United States Department of   \nVeterans Affairs, and its own internal        \nprograms. Under these programs, the Company   \noffers qualifying homeowners the opportunity  \nto permanently modify their loan and achieve  \nmore affordable monthly payments by providing \nloan concessions. These concessions may       \ninclude adjustments to interest rates,        \nconversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates,\nextensions of maturity dates or deferrals of  \npayments, capitalization of accrued interest  \nand/or outstanding advances, or in limited    \nsituations, partial forgiveness of loan       \nprincipal. In most instances, participation in\nresidential mortgage loan restructuring       \nprograms requires the customer to complete a  \nshort-term trial period. A permanent loan     \nmodification is contingent on the customer    \nsuccessfully completing the trial period      \narrangement, and the loan documents are not   \nmodified until that time. The Company reports \nloans in a trial period arrangement as TDRs   \nand continues to report them as TDRs after the\ntrial period. Credit card and other retail    \nloan TDRs are generally part of distinct      \nrestructuring programs providing customers    \nmodification solutions over a specified time  \nperiod, generally up to 60 months. In         \naccordance with regulatory guidance, the      \nCompany considers secured consumer loans that \nhave had debt discharged through bankruptcy   \nwhere the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt\nto be TDRs. If the loan amount exceeds the    \ncollateral value, the loan is charged down to \ncollateral value and the remaining amount is  \nreported as nonperforming. The following table\nprovides a summary of TDRs by loan class,     \nincluding the delinquency status for TDRs that\ncontinue to accrue interest and TDRs included \nin nonperforming assets:

   \n                                              \nShort-term and Other Loan Modifications The   \nCompany makes short-term and other            \nmodifications that it does not consider to be \nTDRs, in limited circumstances, to assist     \nborrowers experiencing temporary hardships,   \nincluding previously offering payment relief  \nto borrowers that have experienced financial  \nhardship resulting directly from the effects  \nof the COVID-19pandemic. Short-term consumer  \nlending modification programs include payment \nreductions, deferrals of up to three past due \npayments, and the ability to return to current\nstatus if the borrower makes required         \npayments. The Company may also make short-term\nmodifications to commercial lending loans,    \nwith the most common modification being an    \nextension of the maturity date of three months\nor less. Such extensions generally are used   \nwhen the maturity date is imminent and the    \nborrower is experiencing some level of        \nfinancial stress, but the Company believes the\nborrower will pay all contractual amounts     \nowed. Nonperforming Assets The level of       \nnonperforming assets represents another       \nindicator of the potential for future credit  \nlosses. Nonperforming assets include          \nnonaccrual loans, restructured loans not      \nperforming in accordance with modified terms  \nand not accruing interest, restructured loans \nthat have not met the performance period      \nrequired to return to accrual status, other   \nreal estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d) and other          \nnonperforming assets owned by the Company.    \nInterest payments collected from assets on    \nnonaccrual status are generally applied       \nagainst the principal balance and not recorded\nas income. However, interest income may be    \nrecognized for interest payments if the       \nremaining carrying amount of the loan is      \nbelieved to be collectible. At March 31, 2022,\ntotal nonperforming assets were $811 million, \ncompared to $878 million at December 31, 2021.\nThe $67 million (7.6 percent) decrease in     \nnonperforming assets was driven by a decrease \nin nonperforming commercial real estate loans.\nThe ratio of total nonperforming assets to    \ntotal loans and other real estate was 0.25    \npercent at March 31, 2022, compared with 0.28 \npercent at December 31, 2021. OREO was $23    \nmillion at March 31, 2022, compared with $22  \nmillion at December 31, 2021, and was related \nto foreclosed properties that previously      \nsecured loan balances. These balances exclude \nforeclosed GNMA loans whose repayments are    \nprimarily insured by the Federal Housing      \nAdministration or guaranteed by the United    \nStates Department of Veterans Affairs.        \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    15  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n

charge-offs were $162 million for the     \nfirst quarter of 2022, compared with $223     \nmillion for the first quarter of 2021. The $61\nmillion (27.4 percent) decrease in net charge-\noffs reflected improvement across most loan   \ncategories, associated with borrower liquidity\nand strong asset prices in the market that    \nsupport repayment and recovery on problem     \nloans. The ratio of total loan net charge-offs\nto average loans outstanding on an annualized \nbasis for the first quarter of 2022 was 0.21  \npercent, compared with 0.31 percent for the   \nfirst quarter of 2021. Analysis and           \nDetermination of the Allowance for Credit     \nLosses The allowance for credit losses is     \nestablished for current expected credit losses\non the Company\u2019s loan and lease portfolio,    \nincluding unfunded credit commitments. The    \nallowance considers expected losses for the   \nremaining lives of the applicable assets,     \ninclusive of expected recoveries. The         \nallowance for credit losses is increased      \nthrough provisions charged to earnings and    \nreduced by net charge-offs. Management        \nevaluates the appropriateness of the allowance\nfor credit losses on a quarterly basis.       \nMultiple economic scenarios are considered    \nover a three-year reasonable and supportable  \nforecast period, which includes increasing    \nconsideration of historical loss experience   \nover years two and three. These economic      \nscenarios are constructed with interrelated   \nprojections of multiple economic variables,   \nand loss estimates are produced that consider \nthe historical correlation of those economic  \nvariables with credit losses. After the       \nforecast period, the Company fully reverts to \nlong-term historical loss experience, adjusted\nfor prepayments and characteristics of the    \ncurrent loan and lease portfolio, to estimate \nlosses over the remaining life of the         \nportfolio. The economic scenarios are updated \nat least quarterly and are designed to provide\na range of reasonable estimates from better to\nworse than current expectations. Scenarios are\nweighted based on the Company\u2019s expectation of\neconomic conditions for the foreseeable future\nand reflect significant judgment and          \nconsideration of economic forecast            \nuncertainty. Final loss estimates also        \nconsider factors affecting credit losses not  \nreflected in the scenarios, due to the unique \naspects of current conditions and             \nexpectations. These factors may include, but  \nare not limited to, loan servicing practices, \nregulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and        \nmonetary policy actions. Because business     \nprocesses and credit risks associated with    \nunfunded credit commitments are essentially   \nthe same as for loans, the Company utilizes   \nsimilar processes to estimate its liability   \nfor unfunded credit commitments, which is     \nincluded in other liabilities in the          \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Both the allowance\nfor loan losses and the liability for unfunded\ncredit commitments are included in the        \nCompany\u2019s analysis of credit losses and       \nreported reserve ratios. The allowance        \nrecorded for credit losses utilizes forward-  \nlooking expected loss models to consider a    \nvariety of factors affecting lifetime credit  \nlosses. These factors include, but are not    \nlimited to, macroeconomic variables such as   \nunemployment rates, real estate prices, gross \ndomestic product levels and corporate bond    \nspreads, as well as loan and borrower         \ncharacteristics, such as internal risk ratings\non commercial loans and consumer credit       \nscores, delinquency status, collateral type   \nand available valuation information,          \nconsideration of end-of-termlosses on lease   \nresiduals, and the remaining                  \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    17  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nterm of the loan, adjusted for expected       \nprepayments. For each loan portfolio, model   \nestimates are adjusted as necessary to        \nconsider any relevant changes in portfolio    \ncomposition, lending policies, underwriting   \nstandards, risk management practices, economic\nconditions or other factors that may affect   \nthe accuracy of the model. Expected credit    \nloss estimates also include consideration of  \nexpected cash recoveries on loans previously  \ncharged-offor expected recoveries on          \ncollateral-dependent loans where recovery is  \nexpected through sale of the collateral. Where\nloans do not exhibit similar risk             \ncharacteristics, an individual analysis is    \nperformed to consider expected credit losses. \nThe allowance recorded for individually       \nevaluated loans greater than $5 million in the\ncommercial lending segment is based on an     \nanalysis utilizing expected cash flows        \ndiscounted using the original effective       \ninterest rate, the observable market price of \nthe loan, or the fair value of the collateral,\nless selling costs, for collateral-dependent  \nloans as appropriate. For commercial TDRs     \nindividually evaluated for impairment,        \nattributes of the borrower are the primary    \nfactors in determining the allowance for      \ncredit losses. For smaller commercial loans   \ncollectively evaluated for impairment,        \nhistorical loss experience is also            \nincorporated into the allowance methodology   \napplied to this category of loans. The        \nallowance recorded for TDR loans in the       \nconsumer lending segment is determined on a   \nhomogenous pool basis utilizing expected cash \nflows discounted using the original effective \ninterest rate of the pool. The expected cash  \nflows on TDR loans consider subsequent payment\ndefaults since modification, the borrower\u2019s   \nability to pay under the restructured terms,  \nand the timing and amount of payments. The    \nallowance for collateral-dependent loans in   \nthe consumer lending segment is determined    \nbased on the current fair value of the        \ncollateral less costs to sell. When evaluating\nthe appropriateness of the allowance for      \ncredit losses for any loans and lines in a    \njunior lien position, the Company considers   \nthe delinquency and modification status of the\nfirst lien. At March 31, 2022, the Company    \nserviced the first lien on 35 percent of the  \nhome equity loans and lines in a junior lien  \nposition. The Company also considers the      \nstatus of first lien mortgage accounts        \nreported on customer credit bureau files when \nthe first lien is not serviced by the Company.\nRegardless of whether the Company services the\nfirst lien, an assessment is made of economic \nconditions, problem loans, recent loss        \nexperience and other factors in determining   \nthe allowance for credit losses. Based on the \navailable information, the Company estimated  \n$205 million or 2.0 percent of its total home \nequity portfolio at March 31, 2022,           \nrepresented non-delinquentjunior liens where  \nthe first lien was delinquent or modified. The\nCompany considers historical loss experience  \non the loans and lines in a junior lien       \nposition to establish loss estimates for      \njunior lien loans and lines the Company       \nservices that are current, but the first lien \nis delinquent or modified. The historical     \nlong-term average loss experience related to  \njunior liens has been relatively limited (less\nthan 1 percent of the total portfolio         \nannually), and estimates are adjusted to      \nconsider current collateral support and       \nportfolio risk characteristics. These include \nupdated credit scores and collateral estimates\nobtained on the Company\u2019s home equity         \nportfolio each quarter. In its evaluation of  \nthe allowance for credit losses, the Company  \nalso considers the increased risk of loss     \nassociated with home equity lines that are    \ncontractually scheduled to convert from a     \nrevolving status to a fully amortizing        \npayment. When a loan portfolio is purchased,  \nthe acquired loans are divided into those     \nconsidered purchased with more than           \ninsignificant credit deterioration (\u201cPCD\u201d) and\nthose not considered purchased with more than \ninsignificant credit deterioration. An        \nallowance is established for each population  \nand considers product mix, risk               \ncharacteristics of the portfolio, bankruptcy  \nexperience, delinquency status and refreshed  \nLTV ratios when possible. The allowance       \nestablished for purchased loans not considered\nPCD is recognized through provision expense   \nupon acquisition, whereas the allowance       \nestablished for loans considered PCD at       \nacquisition is offset by an increase in the   \nbasis of the acquired loans. Any subsequent   \nincreases and decreases in the allowance      \nrelated to purchased loans, regardless of PCD \nstatus, are recognized through provision      \nexpense, with charge-offs charged to the      \nallowance. The Company did not have a material\namount of PCD loans included in its loan      \nportfolio at March 31, 2022. The Company\u2019s    \nmethodology for determining the appropriate   \nallowance for credit losses also considers the\nimprecision inherent in the methodologies used\nand allocated to the various loan portfolios. \nAs a result, amounts determined under the     \nmethodologies described above are adjusted by \nmanagement to consider the potential impact of\nother qualitative factors not captured in     \nquantitative model adjustments which include, \nbut are not limited to, the following: model  \nimprecision, imprecision in economic scenario \nassumptions, and emerging risks related to    \neither changes in the economic environment    \nthat are affecting specific portfolios, or    \nchanges in portfolio concentrations over time \nthat may affect model performance. The        \nconsideration of these items results in       \nadjustments to allowance amounts included in  \nthe Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses for \neach loan portfolio.                          \n                      \n  18    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nAlthough the Company determined the amount of \neach element of the allowance separately and  \nconsiders this process to be an important     \ncredit management tool, the entire allowance  \nfor credit losses is available for the entire \nloan portfolio. The actual amount of losses   \ncan vary significantly from the estimated     \namounts. At March 31, 2022, the allowance for \ncredit losses was $6.1 billion (1.91 percent  \nof period-endloans), compared with an         \nallowance of $6.2 billion (1.97 percent of    \nperiod-endloans) at December 31, 2021. The    \nratio of the allowance for credit losses to   \nnonperforming loans was 798 percent at March  \n31, 2022, compared with 738 percent at        \nDecember 31, 2021. The ratio of the allowance \nfor credit losses to annualized loan net      \ncharge-offs was 929 percent at March 31, 2022,\ncompared with 902 percent of full year 2021   \nnet charge-offs at December 31, 2021. The     \ndecrease in the allowance for credit losses of\n$50 million (0.8 percent) at March 31, 2022,  \ncompared with December 31, 2021, was driven by\ncontinued strong credit quality, partially    \noffset by loan growth and increasing economic \nuncertainty. Economic uncertainty remains high\nassociated with supply chain and rising       \ninflationary concerns, market volatility,     \nrising oil prices resulting from the Russia-  \nUkraine conflict and additional virus         \nvariants. In addition to these factors,       \nexpected loss estimates consider various      \nfactors including customer specific           \ninformation impacting changes in risk ratings,\nprojected delinquencies and the detrimental   \neffects of inflationary pressures and rising  \ninterest rates which impact borrowers\u2019        \nliquidity and ability to repay. Economic      \nconditions considered in estimating the       \nallowance for credit losses at March 31, 2022 \nincluded changes in projected gross domestic  \nproduct and unemployment levels.

The allowance for credit losses  \nrelated to consumer lending segment loans     \nincreased $12 million during the first quarter\nof 2022, mainly due to loan growth and rising \neconomic uncertainty.

                 \nResidual Value Risk Management The Company    \nmanages its risk to changes in the residual   \nvalue of leased vehicles, office and business \nequipment, and other assets through           \ndisciplined residual valuation at the         \ninception of a lease, diversification of its  \nleased assets, regular residual asset         \nvaluation reviews and monitoring of residual  \nvalue gains or losses upon the disposition of \nassets. As of March 31, 2022, no significant  \nchange in the amount of residual values or    \nconcentration of the portfolios had occurred  \nsince December 31, 2021. Refer to             \n\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \u2014       \nResidual Value Risk Management\u201d in the        \nCompany\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor the   \nyear ended December 31, 2021, for further     \ndiscussion on residual value risk management. \nOperational Risk ManagementThe Company        \noperates in many different businesses in      \ndiverse markets and relies on the ability of  \nits employees and systems to process a high   \nnumber of transactions. Operational risk is   \ninherent in all business activities, and the  \nmanagement of this risk is important to the   \nachievement of the Company\u2019s objectives.      \nBusiness lines have direct and primary        \nresponsibility and accountability for         \nidentifying, controlling, and monitoring      \noperational risks embedded in their business  \nactivities, including those additional or     \nincreased risks created by economic and       \nfinancial disruptions. The Company maintains a\nsystem of controls with the objective of      \nproviding proper transaction authorization and\nexecution, proper system operations, proper   \noversight of third parties with whom it does  \nbusiness, safeguarding of assets from misuse  \nor theft, and ensuring the reliability and    \nsecurity of financial and other data.

Compliance Risk  \nManagementThe Company may suffer legal or     \nregulatory sanctions, material financial loss,\nor damage to its reputation through failure to\ncomply with laws, regulations, rules,         \nstandards of good practice, and codes of      \nconduct, including those related to compliance\nwith Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering   \nrequirements, sanctions compliance            \nrequirements as administered by the Office of \nForeign Assets Control, consumer protection   \nand other requirements. The Company has       \ncontrols and processes in place for the       \nassessment, identification, monitoring,       \nmanagement and reporting of compliance risks  \nand issues including those created or         \nincreased by economic and financial           \ndisruptions. Refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion\nand Analysis \u2014 Compliance Risk Management\u201d in \nthe Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor   \nthe year ended December 31, 2021, for further \ndiscussion on compliance risk management.     \nInterest Rate Risk ManagementIn the banking   \nindustry, changes in interest rates are a     \nsignificant risk that can impact earnings and \nthe safety and soundness of an entity. The    \nCompany manages its exposure to changes in    \ninterest rates through asset and liability    \nmanagement activities within guidelines       \nestablished by its Asset Liability Management \nCommittee (\u201cALCO\u201d) and approved by the Board  \nof Directors. The ALCO has the responsibility \nfor approving and ensuring compliance with the\nALCO management policies, including interest  \nrate risk exposure. One way the Company       \nmeasures and analyzes its interest rate risk  \nis through net interest income simulation     \nanalysis. Simulation analysis incorporates    \nsubstantially all of the Company\u2019s assets and \nliabilities and off-balancesheet instruments, \ntogether with forecasted changes in the       \nbalance sheet and assumptions that reflect the\ncurrent interest rate environment. Through    \nthis simulation, management estimates the     \nimpact on net interest income of various      \ninterest rate changes that differ in the      \ndirection, amount and speed of change over    \ntime, as well as the shape of the yield curve.\nThis simulation includes assumptions about how\nthe balance sheet is likely to be affected by \nchanges in loan and deposit growth.           \nAssumptions are made to project interest rates\nfor new loans and deposits based on historical\nanalysis, management\u2019s outlook and re-        \npricingstrategies. These assumptions are      \nreviewed and validated on a periodic basis    \nwith sensitivity analysis being provided for  \nkey variables of the simulation. The results  \nare reviewed monthly by the ALCO and are used \nto guide asset/liability management           \nstrategies. The Company manages its interest  \nrate risk position by holding assets with     \ndesired interest rate risk characteristics on \nits balance sheet, implementing certain       \npricing strategies for loans and deposits and \nselecting derivatives and various funding and \ninvestment portfolio strategies. Table 9      \nsummarizes the projected impact to net        \ninterest income over the next 12 months of    \nvarious potential interest rate changes. The  \nsensitivity of the projected impact to net    \ninterest income over the next 12 months is    \ndependent on balance sheet growth, product    \nmix, deposit behavior, pricing and funding    \ndecisions. While the Company utilizes models  \nand assumptions based on historical           \ninformation and expected behaviors, actual    \noutcomes could vary significantly. Net        \ninterest income sensitivities reflect the     \nimpact of current market expectations for     \ninterest rates,                               \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    21  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table\u00a09    Sensitivity of Net Interest      \n             Income                           \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  *  Given the level of interest rates,       \n     downward rate scenario is not computed.  \n                                              \ndriving an increase in baseline projected net \ninterest income.

Use of Derivatives to Manage\nInterest Rate and Other RisksTo manage the    \nsensitivity of earnings and capital to        \ninterest rate, prepayment, credit, price and  \nforeign currency fluctuations (asset and      \nliability management positions), the Company  \nenters into derivative transactions. The      \nCompany uses derivatives for asset and        \nliability management purposes primarily in the\nfollowing ways:                               \n                                              \n       To convert fixed-rate debt             \n  \u2022    andavailable-for-saleinvestment        \n       securities from fixed-rate payments    \n       to floating-rate payments;             \n                                              \n                                              \n       To convert floating-rate debt from     \n  \u2022    floating-rate payments to fixed-rate   \n       payments;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate changes in value of the    \n  \u2022    Company\u2019s unfunded mortgage loan       \n       commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs;    \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate remeasurement volatility   \n  \u2022    of foreign currency denominated        \n       balances; and                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate the volatility of the      \n  \u2022    Company\u2019s net investment in foreign    \n       operations driven by fluctuations in   \n       foreign currency exchange rates.       \n                                              \nIn addition, the Company enters into interest \nrate and foreign exchange derivative contracts\nto support the business requirements of its   \ncustomers (customer-related positions). The   \nCompany minimizes the market and liquidity    \nrisks of customer-related positions by either \nentering into similar offsetting positions    \nwith broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis  \nby entering into other derivative or non-     \nderivativefinancial instruments that partially\nor fully offset the exposure from these       \ncustomer-related positions. The Company may   \nenter into derivative contracts that are      \neither exchange-traded, centrally cleared     \nthrough clearinghouses or over-the-counter.The\nCompany does not utilize derivatives for      \nspeculative purposes. The Company does not    \ndesignate all of the derivatives that it      \nenters into for risk management purposes as   \naccounting hedges because of the inefficiency \nof applying the accounting requirements and   \nmay instead elect fair value accounting for   \nthe related hedged items. In particular, the  \nCompany enters into interest rate swaps,      \nswaptions, forward commitments to buy to-be-  \nannouncedsecurities (\u201cTBAs\u201d), U.S. Treasury   \nand Eurodollar futures and options on U.S.    \nTreasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in  \nthe value of its MSRs, but does not designate \nthose derivatives as accounting hedges.       \nAdditionally, the Company uses forward        \ncommitments to sell TBAs and other commitments\nto sell residential mortgage loans at         \nspecified prices to economically hedge the    \ninterest rate risk in its residential mortgage\nloan production activities. At March 31, 2022,\nthe Company had $3.9 billion of forward       \ncommitments to sell, hedging $1.4 billion of  \nMLHFS and $3.3 billion of unfunded mortgage   \nloan commitments. The forward commitments to  \nsell and the unfunded mortgage loan           \ncommitments on loans intended to be sold are  \nconsidered derivatives under the accounting   \nguidance related to accounting for derivative \ninstruments and hedging activities. The       \nCompany has elected the fair value option for \nthe MLHFS. Derivatives are subject to credit  \nrisk associated with counterparties to the    \ncontracts. Credit risk associated with        \nderivatives is measured by the Company based  \non the probability of counterparty default.   \nThe Company manages the credit risk of its    \nderivative positions by diversifying its      \npositions among various counterparties, by    \nentering into master netting arrangements,    \nand, where possible, by requiring collateral  \narrangements. The Company may also transfer   \ncounterparty credit risk related to interest  \nrate swaps to third parties through the use of\nrisk participation agreements. In addition,   \ncertain interest rate swaps, interest rate    \nforwards and credit contracts are required to \nbe centrally cleared through clearinghouses to\nfurther mitigate counterparty credit risk. For\nadditional information on derivatives and     \nhedging activities, refer to Notes 13 and 14  \nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial        \nStatements. LIBOR TransitionIn July 2017, the \nUnited Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority  \n(the \u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it would no longer \nrequire banks to submit rates for the London  \nInterBank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) after 2021.  \nIn March 2021, the FCA and the administrator  \nof LIBOR announced that, with respect to the  \nmost commonly used tenors of United States    \nDollar LIBOR, LIBOR will no longer be         \npublished on a representative basis after June\n30, 2023. The publication of all other tenors \nof United States Dollar LIBOR ceased to be    \n                      \n  22    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nprovided or ceased to be representative after \nDecember 31, 2021. The Company holds financial\ninstruments impacted by the discontinuance of \nLIBOR, including certain loans, investment    \nsecurities, derivatives, borrowings and other \nfinancial instruments that use LIBOR as the   \nbenchmark rate. The Company also provides     \nvarious services to customers in its          \ncapacities as trustee and servicer, which     \ninvolve financial instruments that will be    \nsimilarly impacted by the discontinuance of   \nLIBOR. The Company has transitioned financial \ninstruments associated to LIBOR currencies and\ntenors that ceased or became nonrepresentative\non December 31, 2021 to alternative reference \nrates, with limited exceptions. The Company   \nalso anticipates that additional financial    \ninstruments associated to the remaining United\nStates Dollar LIBOR tenors will require       \ntransition to a new reference rate by June 30,\n2023. The Company is currently assessing the  \napplicability and scope of the Adjustable     \nInterest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the \u201cLIBOR Act\u201d),  \nwhich was enacted on March 15, 2022. The LIBOR\nAct establishes a process for replacing LIBOR \non existing LIBOR contracts that do not       \nprovide for the use of a clearly defined or   \npracticable replacement benchmark rate by     \nproviding that a benchmark replacement        \nidentified by the Federal Reserve Board that  \nis based on the Secured Overnight Financing   \nRate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) will replace LIBOR as the       \nbenchmark for such contracts. The final       \nimplementation of the LIBOR Act currently     \nremains uncertain, as the Federal Reserve has \n180 days after its enactment to issue any     \nregulations that are necessary for its        \nadministration. In order to facilitate the    \ntransition process, the Company has instituted\na LIBOR Transition Office and commenced an    \nenterprise-wide project to identify, assess,  \nmonitor and mitigate risks associated with the\nexpected discontinuance or unavailability of  \nLIBOR, actively engage with industry working  \ngroups and regulators, achieve operational    \nreadiness for the use of alternative reference\nrates and engage impacted customers to        \nremediate and transition impacted instruments.\nThe Company has also invested in updating its \nsystems, models, procedures and internal      \ninfrastructure as part of the transition      \nprogram. Additionally, in alignment with      \nguidance from United States banking agencies  \nand the FCA, the Company has ceased the use of\nLIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts,   \nwith limited exceptions, and continues to     \nincrease the usage of alternative reference   \nrates such as SOFR. The Company has also      \nadopted industry best practice guidelines for \nfallback language for new transactions,       \nconverted its cleared interest rate swaps     \ndiscounting to SOFR discounting, and          \ndistributed communications related to the     \ntransition to certain impacted parties, both  \ninside and outside the Company. Refer to \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on    \nForm 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2021,\nfor further discussion on potential risks that\ncould adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial\nresults as a result of the LIBOR transition.  \nMarket Risk ManagementIn addition to interest \nrate risk, the Company is exposed to other    \nforms of market risk, principally related to  \ntrading activities which support customers\u2019   \nstrategies to manage their own foreign        \ncurrency, interest rate risk and funding      \nactivities. For purposes of its internal      \ncapital adequacy assessment process, the      \nCompany considers risk arising from its       \ntrading activities, as well as the            \nremeasurement volatility of foreign currency  \ndenominated balances included on its          \nConsolidated Balance Sheet (collectively,     \n\u201cCovered Positions\u201d), employing methodologies \nconsistent with the requirements of regulatory\nrules for market risk. The Company\u2019s Market   \nRisk Committee (\u201cMRC\u201d), within the framework  \nof the ALCO, oversees market risk management. \nThe MRC monitors and reviews the Company\u2019s    \nCovered Positions and establishes policies for\nmarket risk management, including exposure    \nlimits for each portfolio. The Company uses a \nVaR approach to measure general market risk.  \nTheoretically, VaR represents the statistical \nrisk of loss the Company has to adverse market\nmovements over a one-daytime horizon. The     \nCompany uses the Historical Simulation method \nto calculate VaR for its Covered Positions    \nmeasured at the ninety-ninth percentile using \na one-yearlook-back period for distributions  \nderived from past market data. The market     \nfactors used in the calculations include those\npertinent to market risks inherent in the     \nunderlying trading portfolios, principally    \nthose that affect the Company\u2019s corporate bond\ntrading business, foreign currency transaction\nbusiness, client derivatives business, loan   \ntrading business and municipal securities     \nbusiness, as well as those inherent in the    \nCompany\u2019s foreign denominated balances and the\nderivatives used to mitigate the related      \nmeasurement volatility. On average, the       \nCompany expects the one-dayVaR to be exceeded \nby actual losses two to three times per year  \nrelated to these positions. The Company       \nmonitors the accuracy of internal VaR models  \nand modeling processes by back-testing model  \nperformance, regularly updating the historical\ndata used by the VaR models and regular model \nvalidations to assess the accuracy of the     \nmodels\u2019 input, processing, and reporting      \ncomponents. All models are required to be     \nindependently reviewed and approved prior to  \nbeing placed in use. If the Company were to   \nexperience market losses in excess of the     \nestimated VaR more often than expected, the   \nVaR models and associated assumptions would be\nanalyzed and adjusted.                        \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    23  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe average, high, low and period-end one-    \ndayVaR amounts for the Company\u2019s Covered      \nPositions were as follows:                    \n                                              \n  Three Months Ended                          \n  March\u00a031                                    \n  (Dollars in                                 \n  Millions)                  2022       2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Average                 $     2    $     3  \n  High                          2          4  \n  Low                           1          1  \n  Period-end                    2          2  \n                                              \nThe Company did not experience any actual     \nlosses for its combined Covered Positions that\nexceeded VaR during the three months ended    \nMarch 31, 2022 and 2021.

The Company engages in various  \nactivities to manage its liquidity risk. These\nactivities include diversifying its funding   \nsources, stress testing, and holding readily- \nmarketable assets which can be used as a      \nsource of liquidity if needed. In addition,   \nthe Company\u2019s profitable operations, sound    \ncredit quality and strong capital position    \nhave enabled it to develop a large and        \nreliable base of core deposit funding within  \nits market areas and in domestic and global   \ncapital markets. The Company\u2019s Board of       \nDirectors approves the Company\u2019s liquidity    \npolicy. The Risk Management Committee of the  \nCompany\u2019s Board of Directors oversees the     \nCompany\u2019s liquidity risk management process   \nand approves a contingency funding plan. The  \nALCO reviews the Company\u2019s liquidity policy   \nand limits, and regularly assesses the        \nCompany\u2019s ability to meet funding requirements\narising from adverse company-specific or      \nmarket events. The Company regularly projects \nits funding needs under various stress        \nscenarios and maintains a contingency funding \nplan consistent with the Company\u2019s access to  \ndiversified sources of contingent funding. The\nCompany maintains a substantial level of total\navailable liquidity in the form of on-        \nbalancesheet and off-balancesheet funding     \nsources. These liquidity sources include cash \nat the Federal Reserve Bank and certain       \nEuropean central banks, unencumbered liquid   \nassets, and capacity to borrow from the FHLB  \nand at the Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s Discount    \nWindow.

At March 31, 2022,  \nthe Company could have borrowed a total of an \nadditional $96.3 billion from the FHLB and    \nFederal Reserve Bank based on collateral      \navailable for additional borrowings. The      \nCompany\u2019s diversified deposit base provides a \nsizeable source of relatively stable and low- \ncostfunding, while reducing the Company\u2019s     \nreliance on the wholesale markets. Total      \ndeposits were $461.5 billion at March 31,     \n2022, compared with $456.1 billion at December\n31, 2021. Refer to \u201cBalance Sheet Analysis\u201d   \nfor further information on the Company\u2019s      \ndeposits. Additional funding is provided by   \nlong-term debt and short-term borrowings.     \nLong-term debt was $32.9 billion at March 31, \n2022, and is an important funding source      \nbecause of its multi-year borrowing structure.\nShort-term borrowings were $21.0 billion at   \nMarch 31, 2022, and supplement the Company\u2019s  \nother funding sources. Refer to \u201cBalance Sheet\nAnalysis\u201d for further information on the      \nCompany\u2019s long-term debt and short-term       \nborrowings. In addition to assessing liquidity\nrisk on a consolidated basis, the Company     \nmonitors the parent company\u2019s liquidity. The  \nCompany establishes limits for the minimal    \nnumber of months into the future where the    \nparent company can meet existing and          \nforecasted obligations with cash and          \nsecurities held that can be readily monetized.\nThe Company measures and manages this limit in\nboth normal and adverse conditions. The       \nCompany maintains sufficient funding to meet  \nexpected capital and debt service obligations \nfor 24 months without the support of dividends\nfrom subsidiaries and assuming access to the  \nwholesale markets is maintained. The Company  \nmaintains sufficient liquidity to meet its    \ncapital and debt service obligations for 12   \nmonths under adverse conditions without the   \nsupport of dividends from subsidiaries or     \naccess to the wholesale markets. The parent   \ncompany is currently well in excess of        \nrequired liquidity minimums. At March 31,     \n2022, parent company long-term debt           \noutstanding was $19.8 billion, compared with  \n$18.9 billion at December 31, 2021. The       \nincrease was primarily due to $2.1 billion of \nmedium-term note issuances, partially offset  \nby $1.0 billion of medium-term note           \nrepayments. As of March 31, 2022, there was   \n$1.3 billion of parent company debt scheduled \nto mature in the remainder of 2022. The       \nCompany is subject to a regulatory Liquidity  \nCoverage Ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d) requirement which      \nrequires banks to maintain an adequate level  \nof unencumbered high quality liquid assets to \nmeet estimated liquidity needs over a         \n30-daystressed period. At March 31, 2022, the \nCompany was compliant with this requirement.  \nThe Company is also subject to a regulatory   \nNet Stable Funding Ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) requirement \nwhich requires banks to maintain a minimum    \nlevel of stable funding based on the liquidity\ncharacteristics of their assets, commitments, \nand derivative exposures over a one-yeartime  \nhorizon. At March 31, 2022, the Company was   \ncompliant with this requirement.

European           \nExposuresThe Company provides merchant        \nprocessing and corporate trust services in    \nEurope either directly or through banking     \naffiliations in Europe. Revenue generated from\nsources in Europe represented approximately 2 \npercent of the Company\u2019s total net revenue for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2022.        \nOperating cash for these businesses is        \ndeposited on a short-term basis typically with\ncertain European central banks. For deposits  \nplaced at other European banks, exposure is   \nmitigated by the Company placing deposits at  \nmultiple banks and managing the amounts on    \ndeposit at any bank based on institution-     \nspecific deposit limits. At March 31, 2022,   \nthe Company had an aggregate amount on deposit\nwith European banks of approximately $8.3     \nbillion, predominately with the Central Bank  \nof Ireland and Bank of England. In addition,  \nthe Company provides financing to domestic    \nmultinational corporations that generate      \nrevenue from customers in European countries, \ntransacts with various European banks as      \ncounterparties to certain derivative-related  \nactivities, and through a subsidiary, manages \nmoney market funds that hold certain          \ninvestments in European sovereign debt. Any   \ndeterioration in economic conditions in       \nEurope, including the impacts resulting from  \nthe Russia-Ukraine conflict, is not expected  \nto have a significant effect on the Company   \nrelated to these activities.

The Company also manages \nits capital to exceed regulatory capital      \nrequirements for banking organizations. The   \nregulatory capital requirements effective for \nthe Company follow Basel III, with the Company\nbeing subject to calculating its capital      \nadequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted     \nassets under the standardized approach.       \nBeginning in 2022, the Company began to phase \ninto its regulatory capital requirements the  \ncumulative deferred impact of its 2020        \nadoption of the accounting guidance related to\nthe impairment of financial instruments based \non the current expected credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d)\nmethodology plus 25 percent of its quarterly  \ncredit reserve increases over the past two    \nyears. This cumulative deferred impact will be\nphased into the Company\u2019s regulatory capital  \nover the next three years, culminating with a \nfully phased in regulatory capital calculation\nbeginning in 2025. Table 10 provides a summary\nof statutory regulatory capital ratios in     \neffect for the Company at March 31, 2022 and  \nDecember 31, 2021. All regulatory ratios      \nexceeded regulatory \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d        \nrequirements. The Company believes certain    \nother capital ratios are useful in evaluating \nits capital adequacy. The Company\u2019s tangible  \ncommon equity, as a percent of tangible assets\nand as a percent of risk-weighted assets      \ndetermined in accordance with transitional    \nregulatory capital requirements related to the\nCECL methodology under the standardized       \napproach, was 6.0 percent and 8.0 percent,    \nrespectively, at March 31, 2022, compared with\n6.8 percent and 9.2 percent, respectively, at \nDecember 31, 2021. In addition, the Company\u2019s \ncommon equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted \nassets ratio, reflecting the full             \nimplementation of the CECL methodology was 9.5\npercent at March 31, 2022, compared with 9.6  \npercent at December 31, 2021. Refer to \u201cNon-  \nGAAPFinancial Measures\u201d beginning on page 30  \nfor further information on these other capital\nratios. Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders\u2019      \nequity was $51.2 billion at March 31, 2022,   \ncompared with $54.9 billion at December 31,   \n2021. The decrease was primarily the result of\nchanges in unrealized gains and losses on     \navailable-for-saleinvestment securities       \nincluded in other comprehensive income (loss) \nand dividends, partially offset by corporate  \nearnings and the issuance of preferred stock. \nThe Company announced on December 22, 2020    \nthat its Board of Directors had approved an   \nauthorization to repurchase $3.0 billion of   \nits common stock beginning January 1, 2021,   \nand repurchased $1.5 billion of its common    \nstock during the first six months of 2021     \nunder this program. The Company suspended all \ncommon stock repurchases at the beginning of  \nthe third quarter of 2021, except for those   \ndone exclusively in connection with its stock-\nbased compensation programs, due to its       \npending acquisition of MUFG Union Bank\u2019s core \nregional banking franchise. The Company       \nexpects to operate at a common equity tier 1  \ncapital ratio between its target ratio of 8.5 \npercent and 9.0 percent after closing of the  \nacquisition. The Company does not expect to   \ncommence repurchasing its common stock until  \nafter the acquisition closes and its common   \nequity tier 1 capital ratio approximates 9.0  \npercent.

Corporate and Commercial Banking     \ncontributed $418 million of the Company\u2019s net \nincome in the first quarter of 2022, or a     \ndecrease of $51 million (10.9 percent)        \ncompared with the first quarter of 2021. Net  \nrevenue decreased $7 million (0.7 percent) in \nthe first quarter of 2022, compared with the  \nfirst quarter of 2021. Noninterest income     \ndecreased $23 million (8.6 percent) in the    \nfirst quarter of 2022, compared with the first\nquarter of 2021, primarily due to lower       \ncorporate bond fees and trading revenue within\nthe capital markets business, partially offset\nby stronger treasury management fees due to   \ncore growth driven by the economic recovery.  \nNet interest income, on a taxable-equivalent  \nbasis, increased $16 million (2.2 percent) in \nthe first quarter of 2022, compared with the  \nfirst quarter of 2021. The increase was       \nprimarily due to higher loan and deposit      \nbalances, partially offset by the impact of   \nloan mix and related yields as well as        \nunfavorable changes in deposit rates.         \nNoninterest expense increased $10 million (2.4\npercent) in the first quarter of 2022,        \ncompared with the first quarter of 2021,      \nprimarily due to an increase in net shared    \nservices expense driven by investment in      \ninfrastructure and technology development as  \nwell as higher compensation expense primarily \ndue to merit increases and hiring to support  \nbusiness growth, partially offset by lower    \nperformance-based incentives related to       \ncapital markets activity. The provision for   \ncredit losses increased $51 million in the    \nfirst quarter of 2022, compared with the first\nquarter of 2021, primarily due to loan loss   \nprovisions supporting stronger growth in loan \nbalances, partially offset by improving       \nportfolio credit quality. Consumer and        \nBusiness Banking Consumer and Business Banking\ndelivers products and services through banking\noffices, telephone servicing and sales, on-   \nlineservices, direct mail, ATM processing and \nmobile devices. It encompasses community      \nbanking, metropolitan banking and indirect    \nlending, as well as mortgage banking. Consumer\nand Business Banking contributed $393 million \nof the Company\u2019s net income in the first      \nquarter of 2022, or a decrease of $182 million\n(31.7 percent) compared with the first quarter\nof 2021. Net revenue decreased $96 million    \n(4.6 percent) in the first quarter of 2022,   \ncompared with the first quarter of 2021.      \nNoninterest income decreased $108 million     \n(19.0 percent) in the first quarter of 2022,  \ncompared with the first quarter of 2021,      \nprimarily due to lower mortgage banking       \nrevenue reflecting lower application volume,  \ngiven declining refinance activities, and     \nlower related gain on sale margins, partially \noffset by an increase in the fair value of    \nMSRs, net of hedging activities, as well as   \nhigher performing loan sales. Noninterest     \nincome further decreased due to lower other   \nnoninterest income, driven by lower retail    \nleasing end-of-termresidual gains. Offsetting \nthese decreases, deposit service charges      \nincreased driven by higher customer spend     \nactivity, net of the impact of the elimination\nof certain consumer non-sufficientfunds fees  \nin the first quarter of 2022.

The provision for credit losses       \nincreased $86 million in the first quarter of \n2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021,\nreflecting higher ending loan balances,       \npartially offset by credit quality            \nimprovement. Wealth Management and Investment \nServices Wealth Management and Investment     \nServices provides private banking, financial  \nadvisory services, investment management,     \nretail brokerage services, insurance, trust,  \ncustody and fund servicing through four       \nbusinesses: Wealth Management, Global         \nCorporate Trust & Custody, U.S. Bancorp Asset \nManagement and Fund Services. Wealth          \nManagement and Investment Services contributed\n$206 million of the Company\u2019s net income in   \nthe first quarter of 2022, or a decrease of   \n$19 million (8.4 percent) compared with the   \nfirst quarter of 2021. Net revenue increased  \n$71 million (8.9 percent) in the first quarter\nof 2022, compared with the first quarter of   \n2021. Net interest income, on a taxable-      \nequivalent basis, increased $6 million (2.2   \npercent) in the first quarter of 2022,        \ncompared with the first quarter of 2021,      \nprimarily due to higher average noninterest-  \nbearing deposit balances as well as higher    \naverage loan balances. Noninterest income     \nincreased $65 million (12.2 percent) in the   \nfirst quarter of 2022, compared with the first\nquarter of 2021, primarily due to core        \nbusiness growth in trust and investment       \nmanagement fees and investment products fees, \nboth driven by favorable market conditions, as\nwell as the impact of the PFM acquisition on  \ntrust and investment management fees,         \npartially offset by higher fee waivers related\nto money market funds. Noninterest expense    \nincreased $93 million (18.8 percent) in the   \nfirst quarter of 2022, compared with the first\nquarter of 2021, reflecting the PFM           \nacquisition, higher compensation expense as a \nresult of merit increases and performance-    \nbased incentives, litigation settlements,     \nfraud-related losses and core business growth.\nThe provision for credit losses increased $3  \nmillion (60.0 percent) in the first quarter of\n2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021,\nprimarily due to stronger growth in ending    \nloans. Payment Services Payment Services      \nincludes consumer and business credit cards,  \nstored-value cards, debit cards, corporate,   \ngovernment and purchasing card services,      \nconsumer lines of credit and merchant         \nprocessing. Payment Services contributed $372 \nmillion of the Company\u2019s net income in the    \nfirst quarter of 2022, or a decrease of $115  \nmillion (23.6 percent) compared with the first\nquarter of 2021. Net revenue increased $66    \nmillion (4.7 percent) in the first quarter of \n2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021.\nNoninterest income increased $73 million (9.3 \npercent) in the first quarter of 2022,        \ncompared with the first quarter of 2021,      \nmainly due to continued strengthening of      \nconsumer and business spending across most    \nsectors as local jurisdictions reduce pandemic\nrelated restrictions and consumer behaviors   \nnormalize. As a result, there was strong      \ngrowth in merchant processing services revenue\ndriven by higher sales volume and higher      \nmerchant fees, partially offset by higher     \nrebates. There was also growth in corporate   \npayment products revenue driven by improving  \nbusiness spending across nearly all product   \ngroups. Strong sales also drove an increase in\ncredit and debit card revenue, mostly offset  \nby declining prepaid processing fees as the   \nbeneficial impact of government stimulus      \nprograms continues to dissipate. Net interest \nincome, on a taxable-equivalent basis,        \ndecreased $7 million (1.1 percent) in the     \nfirst quarter of 2022, compared with the first\nquarter of 2021, primarily due to lower loan  \nyields driven by declining customer revolve   \nrates, mostly offset by higher loan balances  \ndue to investment in customer acquisition.    \nNoninterest expense increased $49 million (6.1\npercent) in the first quarter of 2022,        \ncompared with the first quarter of 2021,      \nreflecting higher net shared services expense \ndriven by investment in infrastructure and    \ntechnology development in addition to higher  \ncompensation expense as a result of merit     \nincreases, performance-based incentives and   \ncore business growth. The provision for credit\nlosses increased $171 million in the first    \nquarter of 2022, compared with the first      \nquarter of 2021, primarily due to ending loan \nbalance growth and relatively stable credit   \nquality in the first quarter of 2022, compared\nwith a decline in loan balances and           \ndelinquencies in the prior year.              \n                      \n  28    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table\u00a011    Line of Business Financial      \n              Performance                     \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                     \n  *  Not meaningful  \n                     \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    29  \n                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nTreasury and Corporate Support Treasury and   \nCorporate Support includes the Company\u2019s      \ninvestment portfolios, funding, capital       \nmanagement, interest rate risk management,    \nincome taxes not allocated to the business    \nlines, including most investments in tax-     \nadvantagedprojects, and the residual aggregate\nof those expenses associated with corporate   \nactivities that are managed on a consolidated \nbasis.

Net revenue        \nincreased $92 million (46.9 percent) in the   \nfirst quarter of 2022, compared with the first\nquarter of 2021. Net interest income, on a    \ntaxable-equivalent basis, increased $84       \nmillion in the first quarter of 2022, compared\nwith the first quarter of 2021, primarily due \nto higher investment securities portfolio     \nbalances. Noninterest income increased $8     \nmillion (3.5 percent) in the first quarter of \n2022, compared with the first quarter of 2021,\nprimarily due to the impact of COVID-related  \ndeposit service charges refunds in the first  \nquarter of 2021. Noninterest expense decreased\n$90 million (27.5 percent) in the first       \nquarter of 2022, compared with the first      \nquarter of 2021, primarily due to lower       \nperformance-based incentives and lower costs  \nrelated to tax-advantagedinvestments,         \npartially offset by higher costs of capital   \ninvestments to support business growth and    \ncompensation expense as a result of merit     \nincreases. The provision for credit losses    \nincreased $628 million (89.0 percent) in the  \nfirst quarter of 2022, compared with the first\nquarter of 2021, reflecting the residual      \nimpact of changes in the allowance for credit \nlosses being impacted by rising economic      \nuncertainty in the first quarter of 2022,     \ncompared to improving economic conditions in  \nthe first quarter of 2021.

NON-       \nGAAPFINANCIAL MEASURES In addition to capital \nratios defined by banking regulators, the     \nCompany considers various other measures when \nevaluating capital utilization and adequacy,  \nincluding:                                    \n                                              \n  \u2022    Tangible common equity to tangible     \n       assets,                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Tangible common equity to              \n       risk-weighted assets, and              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Common equity tier\u00a01 capital to        \n  \u2022    risk-weighted assets, reflecting the   \n       full implementation of the CECL        \n       methodology.                           \n                                              \nThese capital measures are viewed by          \nmanagement as useful additional methods of    \nevaluating the Company\u2019s utilization of its   \ncapital held and the level of capital         \navailable to withstand unexpected negative    \nmarket or economic conditions. Additionally,  \npresentation of these measures allows         \ninvestors, analysts and banking regulators to \nassess the Company\u2019s capital position relative\nto other financial services companies. These  \ncapital measures are not defined in generally \naccepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), or   \nare not currently effective or defined in     \nbanking regulations. In addition, certain of  \nthese measures differ from currently effective\ncapital ratios defined by banking regulations \nprincipally in that the currently effective   \nratios, which are subject to certain          \ntransitional provisions, temporarily exclude  \nthe impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting \nguidance related to impairment of financial   \ninstruments based on the CECL methodology. As \na result, these capital measures disclosed by \nthe Company may be considered non-            \nGAAPfinancial measures. Management believes   \nthis information helps investors assess trends\nin the Company\u2019s capital adequacy. The Company\nalso discloses net interest income and related\nratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent   \nbasis, which may also be considered non-      \nGAAPfinancial measures. The Company believes  \nthis presentation to be the preferred industry\nmeasurement of net interest income as it      \nprovides a relevant comparison of net interest\nincome arising from taxable and tax-          \nexemptsources. In addition, certain           \nperformance measures, including the efficiency\nratio and net interest margin utilize net     \ninterest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.\nThere may be limits in the usefulness of these\nmeasures to investors. As a result, the       \nCompany encourages readers to consider the    \nconsolidated financial statements and other   \nfinancial information contained in this report\nin their entirety, and not to rely on any     \nsingle financial measure.                     \n                      \n  30    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents                             \n

ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting   \nand reporting policies of the Company comply  \nwith accounting principles generally accepted \nin the United States and conform to general   \npractices within the banking industry. The    \npreparation of financial statements in        \nconformity with GAAP requires management to   \nmake estimates and assumptions. The Company\u2019s \nfinancial position and results of operations  \ncan be affected by these estimates and        \nassumptions, which are integral to            \nunderstanding the Company\u2019s financial         \nstatements. Critical accounting policies are  \nthose policies management believes are the    \nmost important to the portrayal of the        \nCompany\u2019s financial condition and results, and\nrequire management to make estimates that are \ndifficult, subjective or complex. Most        \naccounting policies are not considered by     \nmanagement to be critical accounting policies.\nManagement has discussed the development and  \nthe selection of critical accounting policies \nwith the Company\u2019s Audit Committee. Those     \npolicies considered to be critical accounting \npolicies relate to the allowance for credit   \nlosses, fair value estimates, MSRs, and income\ntaxes. These accounting policies are discussed\nin detail in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and     \nAnalysis \u2014 Critical Accounting Policies\u201d and  \nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor\nthe year ended December 31, 2021. CONTROLS AND\nPROCEDURES Under the supervision and with the \nparticipation of the Company\u2019s management,    \nincluding its principal executive officer and \nprincipal financial officer, the Company has  \nevaluated the effectiveness of the design and \noperation of its disclosure controls and      \nprocedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)and  \n15d-15(e)under the Securities Exchange Act of \n1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)). Based upon this   \nevaluation, the principal executive officer   \nand principal financial officer have concluded\nthat, as of the end of the period covered by  \nthis report, the Company\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures were effective. During the most\nrecently completed fiscal quarter, there was  \nno change made in the Company\u2019s internal      \ncontrol over financial reporting (as defined  \nin Rules 13a-15(f)and 15d-15(f)under the      \nExchange Act) that has materially affected, or\nis reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial     \nreporting.

\nThe accompanying consolidated financial       \nstatements have been prepared in accordance   \nwith the instructions to Form 10-Q and,       \ntherefore, do not include all information and \nnotes necessary for a complete presentation of\nfinancial position, results of operations and \ncash flow activity required in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in   \nthe United States. In the opinion of          \nmanagement of U.S.\u00a0Bancorp (the \u201cCompany\u201d),   \nall adjustments (consisting only of normal    \nrecurring adjustments) necessary for a fair   \nstatement of results for the interim periods  \nhave been made. These financial statements and\nnotes should be read in conjunction with the  \nconsolidated financial statements and notes   \nincluded in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on    \nForm 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031,     \n2021. Certain amounts in prior periods have   \nbeen reclassified to conform to the current   \nperiod presentation.                          \n                                \n  Note\u00a02    Accounting Changes  \n                                \nReference Interest Rate Transition In March   \n2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(\u201cFASB\u201d) issued accounting guidance, providing\ntemporary optional expedients and exceptions  \nto the guidance in United States generally    \naccepted accounting principles on contract    \nmodifications and hedge accounting, to ease   \nthe financial reporting burdens related to the\nexpected market transition from the London    \nInterbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and other    \ninterbank offered rates to alternative        \nreference rates. Under the guidance, a company\ncan elect not to apply certain modification   \naccounting requirements to contracts affected \nby reference rate transition, if certain      \ncriteria are met. A company that makes this   \nelection would not be required to remeasure   \nthe contracts at the modification date or     \nreassess a previous accounting determination. \nThis guidance also permits a company to elect \nvarious optional expedients that would allow  \nit to continue applying hedge accounting for  \nhedging relationships affected by reference   \nrate transition, if certain criteria are met. \nThe guidance is effective upon issuance and   \ngenerally can be applied through December\u00a031, \n2022. The Company is in the process of        \nevaluating and applying, as applicable, the   \noptional expedients and exceptions in         \naccounting for eligible contract              \nmodifications, eligible existing hedging      \nrelationships and new hedging relationships   \navailable through December\u00a031, 2022. The      \nadoption of this guidance has not had, and is \nexpected to continue to not have, a material  \nimpact on the Company\u2019s financial statements. \nFair Value Hedging \u2013 Portfolio Layer Method In\nMarch 2022, the FASB issued accounting        \nguidance, effective for the Company no later  \nthan January 1, 2023, related to fair value   \nhedge accounting of portfolios of financial   \nassets. This guidance expands the current     \nlast-of-layerhedging method that permits a    \ncompany to apply fair value hedging to a      \nstated amount of a closed portfolio of        \nprepayable financial assets, by allowing it to\ndesignate multiple hedging relationships on a \nsingle closed portfolio, resulting in a larger\nportion of the interest rate risk associated  \nwith such a portfolio being eligible to be    \nhedged. The guidance also expands the scope of\nthe method to include non-prepayablefinancial \nassets and clarifies other technical questions\nfrom the original accounting guidance. The    \nCompany expects the adoption of this guidance \nwill not be material to its financial         \nstatements.                                   \nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Troubled Debt         \nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures In     \nMarch 2022, the FASB issued accounting        \nguidance, effective for the Company no later  \nthan January 1, 2023, related to the          \nrecognition and measurement of troubled debt  \nrestructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d) by creditors. This    \nguidance removes the separate recognition and \nmeasurement requirements for TDRs by replacing\nthem with a requirement for a company to apply\nexisting accounting guidance to determine     \nwhether a modification results in a new loan  \nor a continuation of an existing loan. This   \nguidance also replaces existing TDR           \ndisclosures with similar but more expansive   \ndisclosures for certain modifications of      \nreceivables made to borrowers experiencing    \nfinancial difficulty. Further, this guidance  \nalso requires companies to disclose current-  \nperiod gross write-offs by year of origination\nfor financing receivables. The guidance can be\nadopted on a prospective or modified          \nretrospective basis. The Company expects the  \nadoption of this guidance will not be material\nto its financial statements.                  \n                      \n  38    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\n                                   \n  Note\u00a03    Business Combinations  \n                                   \nIn September 2021, the Company announced that \nit entered into a definitive agreement to     \nacquire MUFG Union Bank\u2019s core regional       \nbanking franchise from Mitsubishi UFJ         \nFinancial Group (\u201cMUFG\u201d), for an expected     \npurchase price of approximately $ 8.0billion, \nincluding $ 5.5billion in cash and            \napproximately 44million shares of the         \nCompany\u2019s common stock. The transaction       \nexcludes the purchase of MUFG Union Bank\u2019s    \nGlobal Corporate & Investment Bank, certain   \nmiddle and back office functions, and other   \nassets. MUFG Union Bank currently has         \napproximately 300branches in California,      \nWashington and Oregon and is expected to add  \napproximately $ 105billion in total assets, $ \n58billion of loans and $ 90billion of deposits\nto the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet.  \nClosing of the transaction is subject to      \ncustomary closing conditions, including       \nregulatory approvals which are not within the \nCompany\u2019s control. The Company expects to     \nclose the transaction approximately 45 days   \nafter being granted U.S. regulatory approvals.\nAt this time, it is uncertain whether such    \napprovals will be received in time to allow   \nfor closing to occur in the first half of     \n2022; however, the parties continue to make   \nsignificant progress in planning for closing  \nand integration while awaiting regulatory     \napprovals.                                    \n                                   \n  Note\u00a04    Investment Securities  \n                                   \nThe Company\u2019s held-to-maturity investment     \nsecurities are carried at historical cost,    \nadjusted for amortization of premiums and     \naccretion of discounts.

If the Company    \nintends to sell or it is more likely than not \nthe Company will be required to sell an       \ninvestment security, the amortized cost of the\nsecurity is written down to fair value. When  \nevaluating credit losses, the Company         \nconsiders various factors such as the nature  \nof the investment security, the credit ratings\nor financial condition of the issuer, the     \nextent of the unrealized loss, expected cash  \nflows of underlying collateral, the existence \nof any government or agency guarantees, and   \nmarket conditions. The Company measures the   \nallowance for credit losses using market      \ninformation where available and discounting   \nthe cash flows at the original effective rate \nof the investment security. The allowance for \ncredit losses is adjusted each period through \nearnings and can be subsequently recovered.   \nThe allowance for credit losses on the        \nCompany\u2019s available-for-sale investment       \nsecurities was immaterial at March 31, 2022   \nand December 31, 2021.                        \n                                              \nAt March\u00a031, 2022, certain investment         \nsecurities had a fair value below amortized   \ncost.

U.S. Treasury and \nagencies securities and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities are issued, guaranteed or otherwise\nsupported by the United States government. The\nCompany\u2019s obligations of state and political  \nsubdivisions are generally high grade.        \nAccordingly, the Company does not consider    \nthese unrealized losses to be credit-related  \nand an allowance for credit losses is not     \nnecessary. In general, the issuers of the     \ninvestment securities are contractually       \nprohibited from prepayment at less than par,  \nand the Company did not pay significant       \npurchase premiums for these investment        \nsecurities. At March\u00a031, 2022, the Company had\nno plans to sell investment securities with   \nunrealized losses, and believes it is more    \nlikely than not it would not be required to   \nsell such investment securities before        \nrecovery of their amortized cost.             \n                                              \nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2022  \nand 2021, the Company did not purchase any    \ninvestment securities that had more-than-     \ninsignificant credit deterioration.           \n                                              \nAll of the Company\u2019s held-to-maturity         \ninvestment securities are highly rated agency \nmortgage-backed securities that are guaranteed\nor otherwise supported by the United States   \ngovernment and have no history of             \n                                              \ncredit losses. Accordingly the Company does   \nnot expect to incur any credit losses on held-\nto-maturity investment securities and has no  \nallowance for credit losses recorded for these\nsecurities.

Net unearned interest   \nand deferred fees and costs amounted to $ 394 \nmillion at March\u00a031, 2022 and $ 475 million at\nDecember\u00a031, 2021. All purchased loans are    \nrecorded at fair value at the date of         \npurchase. The Company evaluates purchased     \nloans for more-than-insignificant             \ndeterioration at the date of purchase in      \naccordance with applicable authoritative      \naccounting guidance. Purchased loans that have\nexperienced more-than-insignificant           \ndeterioration from origination are considered \npurchased credit deteriorated loans. All other\npurchased loans are considered non-           \npurchasedcredit deteriorated loans.           \nAllowance for Credit Losses The allowance for \ncredit losses is established for current      \nexpected credit losses on the Company\u2019s loan  \nand lease portfolio, including unfunded credit\ncommitments. The allowance considers expected \nlosses for the remaining lives of the         \napplicable assets, inclusive of expected      \nrecoveries. The allowance for credit losses is\nincreased through provisions charged to       \nearnings and reduced by net charge-offs.      \nManagement evaluates the appropriateness of   \nthe allowance for credit losses on a quarterly\nbasis.                                        \nMultiple economic scenarios are considered    \nover a three-year reasonable and supportable  \nforecast period, which includes increasing    \nconsideration of historical loss experience   \nover years two and three. These economic      \nscenarios are constructed with interrelated   \nprojections of multiple economic variables,   \nand loss estimates are produced that consider \nthe historical correlation of those economic  \nvariables with credit losses. After the       \nforecast period, the Company fully reverts to \nlong-term historical loss experience, adjusted\nfor prepayments and characteristics of the    \ncurrent loan and lease portfolio, to estimate \nlosses over the remaining life of the         \nportfolio. The economic scenarios are updated \nat least quarterly and are designed to provide\na range of reasonable estimates, from better  \nto worse than current expectations. Scenarios \nare weighted based on the Company\u2019s           \nexpectation of economic conditions for the    \nforeseeable future and reflect significant    \njudgment and consideration of economic        \nforecast uncertainty. Final loss estimates    \nalso consider factors affecting credit losses \nnot reflected in the scenarios, due to the    \nunique aspects of current conditions and      \nexpectations. These factors may include, but  \nare not limited to, loan servicing practices, \nregulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and        \nmonetary policy actions.                      \n                      \n  42    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe allowance recorded for credit losses      \nutilizes forward-looking expected loss models \nto consider a variety of factors affecting    \nlifetime credit losses. These factors include,\nbut are not limited to, macroeconomic         \nvariables such as unemployment rates, real    \nestate prices, gross domestic product levels  \nand corporate bonds spreads, as well as loan  \nand borrower characteristics, such as internal\nrisk ratings on commercial loans and consumer \ncredit scores, delinquency status, collateral \ntype and available valuation information,     \nconsideration of end-of-termlosses on lease   \nresiduals, and the remaining term of the loan,\nadjusted for expected prepayments. For each   \nloan portfolio, model estimates are adjusted  \nas necessary to consider any relevant changes \nin portfolio composition, lending policies,   \nunderwriting standards, risk management       \npractices, economic conditions or other       \nfactors that would affect the accuracy of the \nmodel. Expected credit loss estimates also    \ninclude consideration of expected cash        \nrecoveries on loans previously charged-offor  \nexpected recoveries on collateral dependent   \nloans where recovery is expected through sale \nof the collateral. Where loans do not exhibit \nsimilar risk characteristics, an individual   \nanalysis is performed to consider expected    \ncredit losses. The allowance recorded for     \nindividually evaluated loans greater than $   \n5million in the commercial lending segment is \nbased on an analysis utilizing expected cash  \nflows discounted using the original effective \ninterest rate, the observable market price of \nthe loan, or the fair value of the collateral,\nless selling costs, for collateral-dependent  \nloans as appropriate. The allowance recorded  \nfor Troubled Debt Restructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d) loans \nin the consumer lending segment is determined \non a homogenous pool basis utilizing expected \ncash flows discounted using the original      \neffective interest rate of the pool. The      \nexpected cash flows on TDR loans consider     \nsubsequent payment defaults since             \nmodification, the borrower\u2019s ability to pay   \nunder the restructured terms, and the timing  \nand amount of payments. The allowance for     \ncollateral-dependent loans in the consumer    \nlending segment is determined based on the    \nfair value of the collateral less costs to    \nsell. For commercial TDRs individually        \nevaluated for impairment, attributes of the   \nborrower are the primary factors in           \ndetermining the allowance for credit losses.  \nFor smaller commercial loans collectively     \nevaluated for impairment, historical loss     \nexperience is also incorporated into the      \nallowance methodology applied to this category\nof loans. The Company\u2019s methodology for       \ndetermining the appropriate allowance for     \ncredit losses also considers the imprecision  \ninherent in the methodologies used and        \nallocated to the various loan portfolios. As a\nresult, amounts determined under the          \nmethodologies described above, are adjusted by\nmanagement to consider the potential impact of\nother qualitative factors not captured in the \nquantitative model adjustments which include, \nbut are not limited to the following: model   \nimprecision, imprecision in economic scenario \nassumptions, and emerging risks related to    \neither changes in the environment that are    \naffecting specific portfolios, or changes in  \nportfolio concentrations over time that may   \naffect model performance. The consideration of\nthese items results in adjustments to         \nallowance amounts included in the Company\u2019s   \nallowance for credit losses for each loan     \nportfolio. The Company also assesses the      \ncredit risk associated with off-balancesheet  \nloan commitments, letters of credit,          \ninvestment securities and derivatives. Credit \nrisk associated with derivatives is reflected \nin the fair values recorded for those         \npositions. The liability for off-balancesheet \ncredit exposure related to loan commitments   \nand other credit guarantees is included in    \nother liabilities. Because business processes \nand credit risks associated with unfunded     \ncredit commitments are essentially the same as\nfor loans, the Company utilizes similar       \nprocesses to estimate its liability for       \nunfunded credit commitments. The results of   \nthe analysis are evaluated quarterly to       \nconfirm the estimates are appropriate for each\nspecific loan portfolio, as well as the entire\nloan portfolio, as the entire allowance for   \ncredit losses is available for the entire loan\nportfolio.                                    \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    43  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nActivity in the allowance for credit losses by\nportfolio class was as follows:               \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026                                \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      $      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026           \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      \u2026      1      5      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      5      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \nThe decrease in the allowance for credit      \nlosses from December 31, 2021 to March 31,    \n2022 reflected continued strong credit        \nquality, partially offset by loan growth and  \nincreasing economic uncertainty.              \n                                              \nCredit Quality The credit quality of the      \nCompany\u2019s loan portfolios is assessed as a    \nfunction of net credit losses, levels of      \nnonperforming assets and delinquencies, and   \ncredit quality ratings as defined by the      \nCompany.                                      \n                                              \nFor all loan portfolio classes, loans are     \nconsidered past due based on the number of    \ndays delinquent except for monthly amortizing \nloans which are classified delinquent based   \nupon the number of contractually required     \npayments not made (for example, two missed    \npayments is considered 30 days delinquent).   \nWhen a loan is placed on nonaccrual status,   \nunpaid accrued interest is reversed, reducing \ninterest income in the current period.        \n                                              \nCommercial lending segment loans are generally\nplaced on nonaccrual status when the          \ncollection of principal and interest has      \nbecome 90 days past due or is otherwise       \nconsidered doubtful. Commercial lending       \nsegment loans are generally fully charged down\nif unsecured by collateral or partially       \ncharged down to the fair value of the         \ncollateral securing the loan, less costs to   \nsell, when the loan is placed on nonaccrual.  \n                                              \nConsumer lending segment loans are generally  \ncharged-offat a specific number of days or    \npayments past due. Residential mortgages and  \nother retail loans secured by 1-4family       \nproperties are generally charged down to the  \nfair value of the collateral securing the     \nloan, less costs to sell, at 180 days past    \ndue. Residential mortgage loans and lines in a\nfirst lien position are placed on nonaccrual  \nstatus in instances where a partial charge-   \noffoccurs unless the loan is well secured and \nin the process of collection. Residential     \nmortgage loans and lines in a junior lien     \nposition secured by 1-4family properties are  \nplaced on nonaccrual status at 120 days past  \ndue or when they are behind a first lien that \nhas become 180 days or greater past due or    \nplaced on nonaccrual status. Any secured      \nconsumer lending segment loan whose borrower  \nhas had debt discharged through bankruptcy,   \nfor which the loan amount exceeds the fair    \nvalue of the collateral, is charged down to   \nthe fair value of the related collateral and  \nthe remaining balance is placed on nonaccrual \nstatus. Credit card loans continue to accrue  \ninterest until the account is charged-        \noff.Credit cards are charged-offat 180 days   \npast due. Other retail loans not secured by   \n1-4family properties are charged-offat 120    \ndays past due; and revolving consumer lines   \nare charged-offat 180 days past due. Similar  \nto credit cards, other retail loans are       \ngenerally not placed on nonaccrual status     \nbecause of the relative short period of time  \nto charge-off.Certain retail customers having \nfinancial difficulties may have the terms of  \ntheir credit card and other loan agreements   \nmodified to require only principal payments   \nand, as such, are reported as nonaccrual.     \n                                              \nFor all loan classes, interest payments       \nreceived on nonaccrual loans are generally    \nrecorded as a reduction to a loan\u2019s carrying  \namount while a loan is on nonaccrual and are  \nrecognized as interest income upon payoff of  \nthe loan. However, interest income may be     \nrecognized for interest payments if the       \nremaining carrying amount of the loan is      \nbelieved to be collectible. In certain        \ncircumstances, loans in any class may be      \nrestored to accrual status, such as when a    \nloan has demonstrated sustained repayment     \nperformance or no amounts are past due and    \nprospects for future payment are no longer in \ndoubt; or when the loan becomes well secured  \nand is in the process of collection. Loans    \nwhere there has been a partial charge-offmay  \nbe returned to accrual status if all principal\nand interest (including amounts previously    \ncharged-off)is expected to be collected and   \nthe loan is current.                          \n                      \n  44    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a summary of     \nloans by portfolio class, including the       \ndelinquency status of those that continue to  \naccrue interest, and those that are           \nnonperforming:                                \n                                              \n  (\u2026                       90                 \n  in                      Da\u2026                 \n  M\u2026                       or                 \n  M\u2026                      Mo\u2026                 \n  3\u2026       Ac\u2026    30-\u2026    Pa\u2026    Non\u2026         \n  2\u2026       Cu\u2026    Days    Due     (b)    To\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  C\u2026    $  11\u2026       $      $       $    $1\u2026  \n                   234     76     174         \n  C\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026       38\u2026      86      1     216    39\u2026  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026       78\u2026     105    140     214    78\u2026  \n  (\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026       21\u2026     194    165       \u2014    22\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       61\u2026     237     68     161    61\u2026  \n  r\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026    $  31\u2026       $    $4\u2026       $    $3\u2026  \n  l\u2026               856            765         \n  D\u2026                                          \n  3\u2026                                          \n  2\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026    $  11\u2026    $530    $49       $    $1\u2026  \n                                  174         \n  C\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026       38\u2026      80     11     284    39\u2026  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026       75\u2026     124    181     226    76\u2026  \n  (\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026       22\u2026     193    165       \u2014    22\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       61\u2026     275     66     150    61\u2026  \n  r\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026    $  30\u2026    $1,\u2026    $4\u2026       $    $3\u2026  \n  l\u2026                              834         \n                                              \n                                              \n       At March\u00a031, 2022, $662million of      \n       loans 30\u201389 days past due and          \n       $1.3billion of loans 90 days or more   \n       past due purchased from Government     \n       National Mortgage Association          \n       (\u201cGNMA\u201d) mortgage pools whose          \n  (a)  repayments are insured by the Federal  \n       Housing Administration or guaranteed   \n       by the United States Department of     \n       Veterans Affairs, were classified as   \n       current, compared with $791million     \n       and $1.5billion at December\u00a031, 2021,  \n       respectively.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Substantially all nonperforming loans  \n       at March\u00a031, 2022 and December\u00a031,     \n       2021, had an associated allowance for  \n  (b)  credit losses.

to maximize the collection of \namounts due when a borrower is experiencing   \nfinancial difficulties or is expected to      \nexperience difficulties in the near-term.     \nConcessionary

The post-       \nmodification balances for these loans reflect \nthe current outstanding balance until a       \npermanent modification is made. In addition,  \nthe post-modification balances typically      \ninclude capitalization of unpaid accrued      \ninterest and/or fees under the various        \nmodification programs. At March 31, 2022,     \n6residential mortgages, 1home equity and      \nsecond mortgage loan and 99loans purchased    \nfrom GNMA mortgage pools with outstanding     \nbalances of less than $ 1million, less than $ \n1million and $ 14million, respectively, were  \nin a trial period and have estimated post-    \nmodification balances of less than $ 1million,\nless than $ 1million and $ 15million,         \nrespectively, assuming permanent modification \noccurs at the end of the trial period.        \n                                              \nThe Company has implemented certain           \nrestructuring programs that may result in     \nTDRs. However, many of the Company\u2019s TDRs are \nalso determined on a case-by-case basis in    \nconnection with ongoing loan collection       \nprocesses.                                    \n                                              \nFor the commercial lending segment,           \nmodifications generally result in the Company \nworking with borrowers on a case-by-case      \nbasis. Commercial and commercial real estate  \nmodifications generally include extensions of \nthe maturity date and may be accompanied by an\nincrease or decrease to the interest rate,    \nwhich may not be deemed a market interest     \nrate. In addition, the Company may work with  \nthe borrower in identifying other changes that\nmitigate loss to the Company, which may       \ninclude additional collateral or guarantees to\nsupport the loan. To a lesser extent, the     \nCompany may waive contractual principal. The  \nCompany classifies all of the above           \nconcessions as TDRs to the extent the Company \ndetermines that the borrower is experiencing  \nfinancial difficulty.                         \n                                              \nModifications for the consumer lending segment\nare generally part of programs the Company has\ninitiated. The Company modifies residential   \nmortgage loans under Federal Housing          \nAdministration, United States Department of   \nVeterans Affairs, or its own internal         \nprograms. Under these programs, the Company   \noffers qualifying homeowners the opportunity  \nto permanently modify their loan and achieve  \nmore affordable monthly payments by providing \nloan concessions. These concessions may       \ninclude adjustments to interest rates,        \nconversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates,\nextension of maturity dates or deferrals of   \npayments, capitalization of accrued interest  \nand/or outstanding advances, or in limited    \nsituations, partial forgiveness of loan       \nprincipal. In most instances, participation in\nresidential mortgage loan restructuring       \nprograms requires the customer to complete a  \nshort-term trial period. A permanent loan     \nmodification is contingent on the customer    \nsuccessfully completing the trial period      \narrangement, and the loan documents are not   \nmodified until that time. The Company reports \nloans in a trial period arrangement as TDRs   \nand continues to report them as TDRs after the\ntrial period.                                 \n                                              \nCredit card and other retail loan TDRs are    \ngenerally part of distinct restructuring      \nprograms providing customers experiencing     \nfinancial difficulty with modifications       \nwhereby balances may be amortized up to 60    \nmonths, and generally include waiver of fees  \nand reduced interest rates.                   \n                                              \nIn addition, the Company considers secured    \nloans to consumer borrowers that have debt    \ndischarged through bankruptcy where the       \nborrower has not reaffirmed the debt to be    \nTDRs.                                         \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    47  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a summary of TDR \nloans that defaulted (fully or partially      \ncharged-off or became 90\u00a0days or more past    \ndue) for the periods presented, that were     \nmodified as TDRs within 12\u00a0months previous to \ndefault:                                      \n                                              \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        2\u2026                  2\u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n       N\u2026        A\u2026        N\u2026        A\u2026       \n       of        D\u2026        of        D\u2026       \n       L\u2026                  L\u2026                 \n  \u2026        2\u2026         $        2\u2026          $  \n                      3                   16  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026         3         1         7          5  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        34         3        15          2  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        1\u2026         9        1\u2026          9  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        83         1        2\u2026          5  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        1\u2026        17        2\u2026         37  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        49         8        30          4  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        2\u2026        $\u2026        2\u2026          $  \n  \u2026                                       41  \n                                              \nIn addition to the defaults in the table      \nabove, the Company had a total of             \n16residential mortgage loans, home equity and \nsecond mortgage loans and loans purchased from\nGNMA mortgage pools for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2022, where borrowers did not       \nsuccessfully complete the trial period        \narrangement and, therefore, are no longer     \neligible for a permanent modification under   \nthe applicable modification program. These    \nloans had aggregate outstanding balances of $ \n2million for the three months ended March 31, \n2022.                                         \n                                              \nAs of March 31, 2022, the Company had $       \n105million of commitments to lend additional  \nfunds to borrowers whose terms of their       \noutstanding owed balances have been modified  \nin TDRs.                                      \n                                              \n            Accounting\u00a0for\u00a0Transfers\u00a0and\u00a0     \n  Note\u00a06    Servicing\u00a0of\u00a0Financial\u00a0Assets\u00a0    \n            and\u00a0Variable\u00a0Interest\u00a0Entities    \n                                              \nThe Company transfers financial assets in the \nnormal course of business. The majority of the\nCompany\u2019s financial asset transfers are       \nresidential mortgage loan sales primarily to  \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d),    \ntransfers of tax-advantaged investments,      \ncommercial loan sales through participation   \nagreements, and other individual or portfolio \nloan and securities sales. In accordance with \nthe accounting guidance for asset transfers,  \nthe Company considers any ongoing involvement \nwith transferred assets in determining whether\nthe assets can be derecognized from the       \nbalance sheet. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Guarantees provided to        \ncertain third parties in connection with the  \ntransfer of assets are further discussed in   \nNote 16.                                      \nFor loans sold under participation agreements,\nthe Company also considers whether the terms  \nof the loan participation agreement meet the  \naccounting definition of a participating      \ninterest. With the exception of servicing and \ncertain performance-based guarantees, the     \nCompany\u2019s continuing involvement with         \nfinancial assets sold is minimal and generally\nlimited to market customary representation and\nwarranty clauses. Any gain or loss on sale    \ndepends on the previous carrying amount of the\ntransferred financial assets, the             \nconsideration received, and any liabilities   \nincurred in exchange for the transferred      \nassets. Upon transfer, any servicing assets   \nand other interests that continue to be held  \nby the Company are initially recognized at    \nfair value.For further information on mortgage\nservicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d), refer to Note 7. On\na limited basis, the Company may acquire and  \npackage high-grade corporate bonds for select \ncorporate customers, in which the Company     \ngenerally has no continuing involvement with  \nthese transactions. Additionally, the Company \nis an authorized GNMA issuer and issues GNMA  \nsecurities on a regular basis. The Company has\nno other asset securitizations or similar     \nasset-backed financing arrangements that are  \noff-balance sheet.                            \nThe Company also provides financial support   \nprimarily through the use of waivers of trust \nand investment management fees associated with\nvarious unconsolidated registered money market\nfunds it manages. The Company provided $      \n58million and $ 47million of support to the   \nfunds during the three months ended March 31, \n2022 and 2021, respectively.                  \nThe Company is involved in various entities   \nthat are considered to be variable interest   \nentities (\u201cVIEs\u201d). The Company\u2019s investments  \nin VIEs are primarily related to investments  \npromoting affordable housing, community       \ndevelopment and renewable energy sources. Some\nof these tax-advantaged investments support   \nthe Company\u2019s regulatory compliance with the  \nCommunity Reinvestment Act. The Company\u2019s     \ninvestments in these entities generate a      \nreturn primarily through the realization of   \nfederal and state income tax credits, and     \nother tax benefits, such as tax deductions    \nfrom operating losses of the investments, over\nspecified time periods. These tax credits are \nrecognized as a reduction of tax expense or,  \nfor investments qualifying as investment tax  \ncredits, as a reduction to the related        \ninvestment asset. The Company recognized      \nfederal and state income tax credits related  \nto its affordable housing and other tax-      \nadvantaged investments in tax expense of $    \n113million and $ 133million for the three     \nmonths ended                                  \n                      \n  48    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nMarch 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The    \nCompany also recognized $ 13million and $     \n37million of investment tax credits for the   \nthree months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021,   \nrespectively. The Company recognized $        \n102million and $ 126million of expenses       \nrelated to all of these investments for the   \nthree months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021,   \nrespectively, of which $ 91million and $      \n92million, respectively, were included in tax \nexpense and the remaining amounts were        \nincluded in noninterest expense.              \n                                              \nThe Company is not required to consolidate    \nVIEs in which it has concluded it does not    \nhave a controlling financial interest, and    \nthus is not the primary beneficiary. In such  \ncases, the Company does not have both the     \npower to direct the entities\u2019 most significant\nactivities and the obligation to absorb losses\nor the right to receive benefits that could   \npotentially be significant to the VIEs.       \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s investments in these            \nunconsolidated VIEs are carried in other      \nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The \nCompany\u2019s unfunded capital and other          \ncommitments related to these unconsolidated   \nVIEs are generally carried in other           \nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe Company\u2019s maximum exposure to loss from   \nthese unconsolidated VIEs include the         \ninvestment recorded on the Company\u2019s          \nConsolidated Balance Sheet, net of unfunded   \ncapital commitments, and previously recorded  \ntax credits which remain subject to recapture \nby taxing authorities based on compliance     \nfeatures required to be met at the project    \nlevel. While the Company believes potential   \nlosses from these investments are remote, the \nmaximum exposure was determined by assuming a \nscenario where the community-based business   \nand housing projects completely fail and do   \nnot meet certain government compliance        \nrequirements resulting in recapture of the    \nrelated tax credits.                          \nThe following table provides a summary of     \ninvestments in community development and tax- \nadvantaged VIEs that the Company has not      \nconsolidated:                                 \n                                              \n  (Dollars                          December  \n  in              March\u00a031,              31,  \n  Millions)            2022             2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Investme\u2026                                   \n  carrying     $      5,106    $       4,484  \n  amount                                      \n  Unfunded                                    \n  capital             2,331            1,890  \n  and other                                   \n  commitme\u2026                                   \n  Maximum                                     \n  exposure            9,764            9,899  \n  to loss                                     \n                                              \nThe Company also has noncontrolling financial \ninvestments in private investment funds and   \npartnerships considered to be VIEs, which are \nnot consolidated. The Company\u2019s recorded      \ninvestment in these entities, carried in other\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, was \napproximately $ 41million at March 31, 2022   \nand $ 40million at December 31, 2021. The     \nmaximum exposure to loss related to these VIEs\nwas $ 84million at March 31, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, representing the Company\u2019s          \ninvestment balance and its unfunded           \ncommitments to invest additional amounts.     \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s individual net investments in   \nunconsolidated VIEs, which exclude any        \nunfunded capital commitments, ranged from less\nthan $ 1million to $ 74million at March 31,   \n2022, compared with less than $ 1million to $ \n75million at December 31, 2021.               \n                                              \nThe Company is required to consolidate VIEs in\nwhich it has concluded it has a controlling   \nfinancial interest.The Company sponsors       \nentities to which it transfers its interests  \nin tax-advantaged investments to third        \nparties. At March 31, 2022, approximately $   \n4.9billion of the Company\u2019s assets and $      \n3.3billion of its liabilities included on the \nConsolidated Balance Sheet were related to    \ncommunity development and tax-advantaged      \ninvestment VIEs which the Company has         \nconsolidated, primarily related to these      \ntransfers. These amounts compared to $        \n5.0billion and $ 3.4billion, respectively, at \nDecember 31, 2021. The majority of the assets \nof these consolidated VIEs are reported in    \nother assets, and the liabilities are reported\nin long-term debt and other liabilities. The  \nassets of a particular VIE are the primary    \nsource of funds to settle its obligations. The\ncreditors of the VIEs do not have recourse to \nthe general credit of the Company. The        \nCompany\u2019s exposure to the consolidated VIEs is\ngenerally limited to the carrying value of its\nvariable interests plus any related tax       \ncredits previously recognized or transferred  \nto others with a guarantee.                   \n                                              \nIn addition, the Company sponsors a municipal \nbond securities tender option bond program.   \nThe Company controls the activities of the    \nprogram\u2019s entities, is entitled to the        \nresidual returns and provides liquidity and   \nremarketing arrangements to the program. As a \nresult, the Company has consolidated the      \nprogram\u2019s entities.

Included in mortgage \nbanking revenue are the MSR fair value changes\narising from market rate and model assumption \nchanges, net of the value change in           \nderivatives used to economically hedge MSRs.  \nThese changes resulted in a net loss of $     \n29million and $ 120million for the three      \nmonths ended March 31, 2022 and 2021,         \nrespectively.

As of March 31, \n2022, federal tax examinations for all years  \nending through December 31, 2014 are completed\nand resolved. The Company\u2019s tax returns for   \nthe years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, 2017 \nand 2018 are under examination by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The years open to examination\nby foreign, state and local government        \nauthorities vary by jurisdiction.             \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s net deferred tax asset was $    \n2.6billion at March 31, 2022 and $ 785million \nat December 31, 2021.                         \n                                     \n  Note\u00a013    Derivative Instruments  \n                                     \nIn the ordinary course of business, the       \nCompany enters into derivative transactions to\nmanage various risks and to accommodate the   \nbusiness requirements of its customers. The   \nCompany recognizes all derivatives on the     \nConsolidated Balance Sheet at fair value in   \nother assets or in other liabilities. On the  \ndate the Company enters into a derivative     \ncontract, the derivative is designated as     \neither a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge,   \nnet investment hedge, or a designation is not \nmade as it is a customer-related transaction, \nan economic hedge for asset/liability risk    \nmanagement purposes or another stand-alone    \nderivative created through the Company\u2019s      \noperations (\u201cfree-standing derivative\u201d). When \na derivative is designated as a fair value,   \ncash flow or net investment hedge, the Company\nperforms an assessment, at inception and, at a\nminimum, quarterly thereafter, to determine   \nthe effectiveness of the derivative in        \noffsetting changes in the value or cash flows \nof the hedged item(s).                        \nFair Value Hedges These derivatives are       \ninterest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge \nthe change in fair value related to interest  \nrate changes of its underlying available-for- \nsaleinvestment securities and fixed-rate debt.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives      \ndesignated as fair value hedges, and changes  \nin the fair value of the hedged items, are    \nrecorded in earnings.                         \nCash Flow Hedges These derivatives are        \ninterest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge \nthe forecasted cash flows from its underlying \nvariable-rate debt. Changes in the fair value \nof derivatives designated as cash flow hedges \nare recorded in other comprehensive income    \n(loss) until the cash flows of the hedged     \nitems are realized. If a derivative designated\nas a cash flow hedge is terminated or ceases  \nto be highly effective, the gain or loss in   \nother comprehensive income (loss) is amortized\nto earnings over the period the forecasted    \nhedged transactions impact earnings. If a     \nhedged forecasted transaction is no longer    \nprobable, hedge accounting is ceased and any  \ngain or loss included in other comprehensive  \nincome (loss) is reported in earnings         \nimmediately, unless the forecasted transaction\nis at least reasonably possible of occurring, \nwhereby the amounts remain within other       \ncomprehensive income (loss). At March 31,     \n2022, the Company had $ 77 million (net-of-   \ntax) of realized and unrealized losses on     \ndiscontinued cash flow hedges recorded in     \nother comprehensive income (loss), compared   \nwith$ 85million (net-of-tax)of realized and   \nunrealized losses at December 31, 2021. The   \nestimated amount to be reclassified from other\ncomprehensive income (loss) into earnings     \nduring the next 12 months is a loss of $      \n27million (net-of-tax).There were no          \nderivatives held as cash flow hedges at March \n31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.               \nNet Investment Hedges The Company uses forward\ncommitments to sell specified amounts of      \ncertain foreign currencies, and non-          \nderivativedebt instruments, to hedge the      \nvolatility of its net investment in foreign   \noperations driven by fluctuations in foreign  \ncurrency exchange rates. The carrying amount  \nof non-derivativedebt instruments designated  \nas net investment hedges was $ 1.3billion at  \nMarch 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021.        \n                      \n  54    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nOther Derivative Positions The Company enters \ninto free-standing derivatives to mitigate    \ninterest rate risk and for other risk         \nmanagement purposes. These derivatives include\nforward commitments to sell to-be-            \nannouncedsecurities (\u201cTBAs\u201d) and other        \ncommitments to sell residential mortgage      \nloans, which are used to economically hedge   \nthe interest rate risk related to mortgage    \nloans held for sale (\u201cMLHFS\u201d) and unfunded    \nmortgage loan commitments. The Company also   \nenters into interest rate swaps, swaptions,   \nforward commitments to buy TBAs, U.S. Treasury\nand Eurodollar futures and options on U.S.    \nTreasury futures to economically hedge the    \nchange in the fair value of the Company\u2019s     \nMSRs. The Company also enters into foreign    \ncurrency forwards to economically hedge       \nremeasurement gains and losses the Company    \nrecognizes on foreign currency denominated    \nassets and liabilities. In addition, the      \nCompany acts as a seller and buyer of interest\nrate derivatives and foreign exchange         \ncontracts for its customers.

     \nderivative contracts. The Company measures    \nthat credit risk using a credit valuation     \nadjustment and includes it within the fair    \nvalue of the derivative. The Company manages  \ncounterparty credit risk through              \ndiversification of its derivative positions   \namong various counterparties, by entering into\nderivative positions that are centrally       \ncleared through clearinghouses, by entering   \ninto master netting arrangements and, where   \npossible, by requiring collateral             \narrangements. A master netting arrangement    \nallows two counterparties, who have multiple  \nderivative contracts with each other, the     \nability to net settle amounts under all       \ncontracts, including any related collateral,  \nthrough a single payment and in a single      \ncurrency. Collateral arrangements generally   \nrequire the counterparty to deliver collateral\n(typically cash or U.S. Treasury and agency   \nsecurities) equal to the Company\u2019s net        \nderivative receivable, subject to minimum     \ntransfer and credit rating requirements.      \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s collateral arrangements are     \npredominately bilateral and, therefore,       \ncontain provisions that require               \ncollateralization of the Company\u2019s net        \nliability derivative positions. Required      \ncollateral coverage is based on net liability \nthresholds and may be contingent upon the     \nCompany\u2019s credit rating from two of the       \nnationally recognized statistical rating      \norganizations. If the Company\u2019s credit rating \nwere to fall below credit ratings thresholds  \nestablished in the collateral arrangements,   \nthe counterparties to the derivatives could   \nrequest immediate additional collateral       \ncoverage up to and including full collateral  \ncoverage for derivatives in a net liability   \nposition. The aggregate fair value of all     \nderivatives under collateral arrangements that\nwere in a net liability position at March 31, \n2022, was $ 1.2billion. At March 31, 2022, the\nCompany had $ 841million of cash posted as    \ncollateral against this net liability         \nposition.                                     \n                                              \n             Netting Arrangements for         \n  Note\u00a014    Certain Financial Instruments    \n             and Securities Financing         \n             Activities                       \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s derivative portfolio consists of\nbilateral over-the-counter trades, certain    \ninterest rate derivatives and credit contracts\nrequired to be centrally cleared through      \nclearinghouses per current regulations, and   \nexchange-traded positions which may include   \nU.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures or       \noptions on U.S. Treasury futures. Of the      \nCompany\u2019s $ 768.8billion total notional amount\nof derivative positions at March 31, 2022, $  \n413.4billion related to                       \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    57  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nbilateral over-the-counter trades, $          \n349.3billion related to those centrally       \ncleared through clearinghouses and $          \n6.1billion related to those that were         \nexchange-traded. The Company\u2019s derivative     \ncontracts typically include offsetting rights \n(referred to as netting arrangements), and    \ndepending on expected volume, credit risk, and\ncounterparty preference, collateral           \nmaintenance may be required. For all          \nderivatives under collateral support          \narrangements, fair value is determined daily  \nand, depending on the collateral maintenance  \nrequirements, the Company and a counterparty  \nmay receive or deliver collateral, based upon \nthe net fair value of all derivative positions\nbetween the Company and the counterparty.     \nCollateral is typically cash, but securities  \nmay be allowed under collateral arrangements  \nwith certain counterparties. Receivables and  \npayables related to cash collateral are       \nincluded in other assets and other liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet, along with \nthe related derivative asset and liability    \nfair values. Any securities pledged to        \ncounterparties as collateral remain on the    \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Securities        \nreceived from counterparties as collateral are\nnot recognized on the Consolidated Balance    \nSheet, unless the counterparty defaults. In   \ngeneral, securities used as collateral can be \nsold, repledged or otherwise used by the party\nin possession. No restrictions exist on the   \nuse of cash collateral by either party. Refer \nto Note 13 for further discussion of the      \nCompany\u2019s derivatives, including collateral   \narrangements. As part of the Company\u2019s        \ntreasury and broker-dealer operations, the    \nCompany executes transactions that are treated\nas securities sold under agreements to        \nrepurchase or securities purchased under      \nagreements to resell, both of which are       \naccounted for as collateralized financings.   \nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase\ninclude repurchase agreements and securities  \nloaned transactions. Securities purchased     \nunder agreements to resell include reverse    \nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed \ntransactions. For securities sold under       \nagreements to repurchase, the Company records \na liability for the cash received, which is   \nincluded in short-term borrowings on the      \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. For securities    \npurchased under agreements to resell, the     \nCompany records a receivable for the cash     \npaid, which is included in other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Securities        \ntransferred to counterparties under repurchase\nagreements and securities loaned transactions \ncontinue to be recognized on the Consolidated \nBalance Sheet, are measured at fair value, and\nare included in investment securities or other\nassets. Securities received from              \ncounterparties under reverse repurchase       \nagreements and securities borrowed            \ntransactions are not recognized on the        \nConsolidated Balance Sheet unless the         \ncounterparty defaults. The securities         \ntransferred under repurchase and reverse      \nrepurchase transactions typically are U.S.    \nTreasury and agency securities, residential   \nagency mortgage-backed securities or corporate\ndebt securities. The securities loaned or     \nborrowed typically are corporate debt         \nsecurities traded by the Company\u2019s broker-    \ndealer subsidiary. In general, the securities \ntransferred can be sold, repledged or         \notherwise used by the party in possession. No \nrestrictions exist on the use of cash         \ncollateral by either party. Repurchase/reverse\nrepurchase and securities loaned/borrowed     \ntransactions expose the Company to            \ncounterparty risk. The Company manages this   \nrisk by performing assessments, independent of\nbusiness line managers, and establishing      \nconcentration limits on each counterparty.    \nAdditionally, these transactions include      \ncollateral arrangements that require the fair \nvalues of the underlying securities to be     \ndetermined daily, resulting in cash being     \nobtained or refunded to counterparties to     \nmaintain specified collateral levels.         \n                      \n  58    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the maturities \nby category of collateral pledged for         \nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned   \ntransactions:                                 \n                                              \n                 \u2026                \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026                \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026       D\u2026       \u2026       T\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  4\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       8\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       5\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       70  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       70  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  1\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  3\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       5\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       6\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  1\u2026  \n                                              \nThe Company executes its derivative,          \nrepurchase/reverse repurchase and securities  \nloaned/borrowed transactions under the        \nrespective industry standard agreements.

Additionally, from time to   \ntime, the Company may be required to record at\nfair value other assets on a nonrecurring     \nbasis, such as loans held for sale, loans held\nfor investment and certain other assets. These\nnonrecurring fair value adjustments typically \ninvolve application of lower-of-cost-or-fair  \nvalue accounting or impairment write-downs of \nindividual assets.                            \nFair value is defined as the exchange price   \nthat would be received for an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability (an exit price) in the   \nprincipal or most advantageous market for the \nasset or liability in an orderly transaction  \nbetween market participants on the measurement\ndate. A fair value measurement reflects all of\nthe assumptions that market participants would\nuse in pricing the asset or liability,        \nincluding assumptions about the risk inherent \nin a particular valuation technique, the      \neffect of a restriction on the sale or use of \nan asset and the risk of nonperformance.      \nThe Company groups its assets and liabilities \nmeasured at fair value into a three-level     \nhierarchy for valuation techniques used to    \nmeasure financial assets and financial        \nliabilities at fair value. This hierarchy is  \nbased on whether the valuation inputs are     \nobservable or unobservable. These levels are: \n                                              \n       Level\u00a01 \u2014 Quoted prices in active      \n       markets for identical assets or        \n  \u2022    liabilities.

Where   \nappropriate, the descriptions include         \ninformation about the valuation models and key\ninputs to those models. During the three      \nmonths ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, there   \nwere no significant changes to the valuation  \ntechniques used by the Company to measure fair\nvalue. Available-For-SaleInvestment Securities\nWhen quoted market prices for identical       \nsecurities are available in an active market, \nthese prices are used to determine fair value \nand these securities are classified within    \nLevel 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 1  \ninvestment securities include U.S. Treasury   \nand exchange-traded securities. For other     \nsecurities, quoted market prices may not be   \nreadily available for the specific securities.\nWhen possible, the Company determines fair    \nvalue based on market observable information, \nincluding quoted market prices for similar    \nsecurities, inactive transaction prices, and  \nbroker quotes. These securities are classified\nwithin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.   \nLevel 2 valuations are generally provided by a\nthird-party pricing service. Level 2          \ninvestment securities are predominantly agency\nmortgage-backed securities, certain other     \nasset-backed securities, obligations of state \nand political subdivisions and agency debt    \nsecurities. Mortgage Loans Held For Sale MLHFS\nmeasured at fair value, for which an active   \nsecondary market and readily available market \nprices exist, are initially valued at the     \ntransaction price and are subsequently valued \nby comparison to instruments with similar     \ncollateral and risk profiles. MLHFS are       \nclassified within Level 2. Included in        \nmortgage banking revenue were net losses of$  \n234 million and$ 215million for the three     \nmonths ended March 31, 2022 and 2021,         \nrespectively, from the changes to fair value  \nof these MLHFS under fair value option        \naccounting guidance. Changes in fair value due\nto instrument specific credit risk were       \nimmaterial. Interest income for MLHFS is      \nmeasured based on contractual interest rates  \nand reported as interest income on the        \nConsolidated Statement of Income. Electing to \nmeasure MLHFS at fair value reduces certain   \ntiming differences and better matches changes \nin fair value of these assets with changes in \nthe value of the derivative instruments used  \nto economically hedge them without the burden \nof complying with the requirements for hedge  \naccounting. Mortgage Servicing Rights MSRs are\nvalued using a discounted cash flow           \nmethodology, and are classified within Level  \n3. The Company determines fair value of the   \nMSRs by projecting future cash flows for      \ndifferent interest rate scenarios using       \nprepayment rates and other assumptions, and   \ndiscounts these cash flows using a risk       \nadjusted rate based on option adjusted spread \nlevels. There is minimal observable market    \nactivity for MSRs on comparable portfolios    \nand, therefore, the determination of fair     \nvalue requires significant management         \njudgment. Refer to Note 7 for further         \ninformation on MSR valuation assumptions.     \nDerivatives The majority of derivatives held  \nby the Company are executed over-the-counteror\ncentrally cleared through clearinghouses and  \nare valued using market standard cash flow    \nvaluation techniques. The models incorporate  \ninputs, depending on the type of derivative,  \nincluding interest rate curves, foreign       \nexchange rates and volatility. All derivative \nvalues incorporate an assessment of the risk  \nof counterparty nonperformance, measured based\non the Company\u2019s evaluation of credit risk    \nincluding external assessments of credit risk.\nThe Company monitors and manages its          \nnonperformance risk by considering its ability\nto net derivative positions under master      \nnetting arrangements, as well as collateral   \nreceived or provided under collateral         \narrangements. Accordingly, the Company has    \nelected to measure the fair value of          \nderivatives, at a counterparty level, on a net\nbasis. The majority of the derivatives are    \nclassified within Level 2 of the fair value   \nhierarchy, as the significant inputs to the   \nmodels, including nonperformance risk, are    \nobservable. However, certain derivative       \ntransactions are with counterparties where    \nrisk of nonperformance cannot be observed in  \nthe market and, therefore, the credit         \nvaluation adjustments result in these         \nderivatives being classified within Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy. The Company also has\nother derivative contracts that are created   \nthrough its operations, including commitments \nto purchase and originate mortgage loans and  \nswap agreements executed in conjunction with  \nthe sale of a portion of its Class B common   \nand preferred shares of Visa Inc. (the \u201cVisa  \nswaps\u201d). The mortgage loan commitments are    \nvalued by pricing models that include market  \nobservable and unobservable inputs, which     \nresult in the commitments being classified    \nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.   \nThe unobservable inputs include assumptions   \nabout the percentage of commitments that      \nactually become a closed loan and the MSR     \nvalue that is inherent in the underlying loan \nvalue. The Visa swaps require payments by     \neither the Company or the purchaser of the    \nVisa Inc. Class B common and preferred shares \nwhen there are changes in the conversion rate \nof the Visa Inc. Class B common and preferred \nshares to Visa Inc. Class A common and        \npreferred shares, respectively, as well as    \nquarterly payments to the purchaser based on  \nspecified terms of the agreements.

This section includes a        \ndescription of the significant inputs used by \nthe Company and a description of any          \ninterrelationships between these inputs. The  \ndiscussion below excludes nonrecurring fair   \nvalue measurements of collateral value used   \nfor impairment measures for loans and OREO.   \nThese valuations utilize third party appraisal\nor broker price opinions, and are classified  \nas Level 3 due to the significant judgment    \ninvolved.                                     \n                                              \nMortgage Servicing Rights The significant     \nunobservable inputs used in the fair value    \nmeasurement of the Company\u2019s MSRs are expected\nprepayments and the option adjusted spread    \nthat is added to the risk-free rate to        \ndiscount projected cash flows. Significant    \nincreases in either of these inputs in        \nisolation would have resulted in a            \nsignificantly lower fair value measurement.   \nSignificant decreases in either of these      \ninputs in isolation would have resulted in a  \nsignificantly higher fair value measurement.  \nThere is no direct interrelationship between  \nprepayments and option adjusted spread.       \nPrepayment rates generally move in the        \nopposite direction of market interest rates.  \nOption adjusted spread is generally impacted  \nby changes in market return requirements.     \nThe following table shows the significant     \nvaluation assumption ranges for MSRs at March \n31, 2022:                                     \n                                              \n                                   Weigh\u2026     \n          Minim\u2026       Maxi\u2026       Avera\u2026     \n                                      (a)     \n  Exp\u2026         7  %       12  %         9  %  \n  pre\u2026                                        \n  Opt\u2026                                        \n  adj\u2026         5          11            6     \n  spr\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Determined based on the relative fair  \n  (a)  value of the related mortgage loans    \n       serviced.                              \n                                              \nDerivatives The Company has two distinct Level\n3 derivative portfolios: (i) the Company\u2019s    \ncommitments to purchase and originate mortgage\nloans that meet the requirements of a         \nderivative and (ii) the Company\u2019s             \nasset/liability and customer-related          \nderivatives that are Level 3 due to           \nunobservable inputs related to measurement of \nrisk of nonperformance by the counterparty.

A significant increase \nin the rate of loans that close would have    \nresulted in a larger derivative asset or      \nliability. A significant increase in the      \ninherent MSR value would have resulted in an  \nincrease in the derivative asset or a         \nreduction in the derivative liability.        \nExpected loan close rates and the inherent MSR\nvalues are directly impacted by changes in    \nmarket rates and will generally move in the   \nsame direction as interest rates.             \nThe following table shows the significant     \nvaluation assumption ranges for the Company\u2019s \nderivative commitments to purchase and        \noriginate mortgage loans at March 31, 2022:   \n                                              \n                                   Weigh\u2026     \n          Minim\u2026       Maxi\u2026       Avera\u2026     \n                                      (a)     \n  Exp\u2026                                        \n  loan         6  %      100  %        82  %  \n  clo\u2026                                        \n  rate                                        \n  Inh\u2026                                        \n  MSR                                         \n  val\u2026                                        \n  (ba\u2026        38         207          110     \n  poi\u2026                                        \n  per                                         \n  loa\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  (a)  Determined based on the relative fair  \n       value of the related mortgage loans.   \n                                              \nThe significant unobservable input used in the\nfair value measurement of certain of the      \nCompany\u2019s asset/liability and customer-related\nderivatives is the credit valuation adjustment\nrelated to the risk of counterparty           \nnonperformance.

Inc. card association \nor its affiliates (collectively \u201cVisa\u201d). In   \n2007, Visa completed a restructuring and      \nissued shares of Visa Inc. common stock to its\nfinancial institution                         \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    65  \n                      \n              Table of Contents               \nmembers in contemplation of its initial public\noffering (\u201cIPO\u201d) completed in the first       \nquarter of 2008 (the \u201cVisa Reorganization\u201d).  \nAs a part of the Visa Reorganization, the     \nCompany received its proportionate number of  \nshares of Visa Inc. common stock, which were  \nsubsequently converted to Class B shares of   \nVisa Inc. (\u201cClass B shares\u201d).                 \n                                              \nVisa U.S.A. Inc. (\u201cVisa U.S.A.\u201d) and          \nMasterCard International (collectively, the   \n\u201cCard Brands\u201d) are defendants in antitrust    \nlawsuits challenging the practices of the Card\nBrands (the \u201cVisa Litigation\u201d). Visa U.S.A.   \nmember banks have a contingent obligation to  \nindemnify Visa Inc. under the Visa U.S.A.     \nbylaws (which were modified at the time of the\nrestructuring in October 2007) for potential  \nlosses arising from the Visa Litigation. The  \nindemnification by the Visa U.S.A. member     \nbanks has no specific maximum amount. Using   \nproceeds from its IPO and through reductions  \nto the conversion ratio applicable to the     \nClass B shares held by Visa U.S.A. member     \nbanks, Visa Inc. has funded an escrow account \nfor the benefit of member financial           \ninstitutions to fund their indemnification    \nobligations associated with the Visa          \nLitigation. The receivable related to the     \nescrow account is classified in other         \nliabilities as a direct offset to the related \nVisa Litigation contingent liability.         \n                                              \nIn October 2012, Visa signed a settlement     \nagreement to resolve class action claims      \nassociated with the multidistrict interchange \nlitigation pending in the United States       \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork (the \u201cMulti-District Litigation\u201d). The   \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit  \nreversed the approval of that settlement and  \nremanded the matter to the district court.    \nThereafter, the case was split into two       \nputative class actions, one seeking damages   \n(the \u201cDamages Action\u201d) and a separate class   \naction seeking injunctive relief only (the    \n\u201cInjunctive Action\u201d). In September 2018, Visa \nsigned a new settlement agreement, superseding\nthe original settlement agreement, to resolve \nthe Damages Action. The Damages Action        \nsettlement was approved by the United States  \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork, but is now on appeal. The Injunctive    \nAction, which generally seeks changes to Visa \nrules, is still pending.                      \n                                              \nOther Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities   \nThe following table is a summary of other     \nguarantees and contingent liabilities of the  \nCompany at March\u00a031, 2022:                    \n                                              \n                                   Maxi\u2026      \n  (D\u2026                              Pote\u2026      \n  in        Coll\u2026       Car\u2026       Futu\u2026      \n  Mi\u2026        Held       Amo\u2026       Paym\u2026      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  St\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026    $      \u2013    $    55    $  9,705      \n  of                                          \n  cr\u2026                                         \n  Th\u2026                                         \n  pa\u2026           \u2013          \u2013           6      \n  bo\u2026                                         \n  ar\u2026                                         \n  Se\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026       10,3\u2026          \u2013       9,933      \n  in\u2026                                         \n  As\u2026           \u2013         85       7,382  -a  \n  sa\u2026                                         \n  Me\u2026         968        106       121,\u2026      \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  Te\u2026                                         \n  op\u2026                                         \n  bo\u2026       1,615          \u2013       1,488      \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  gu\u2026                                         \n  Ot\u2026           \u2013         21       1,331      \n                                              \n                                              \n       The maximum potential future payments  \n       do not include loan sales where the    \n       Company provides standard              \n       representation and warranties to the   \n       buyer against losses related to loan   \n       underwriting documentation defects     \n       that may have existed at the time of   \n       sale that generally are identified     \n       after the occurrence of a triggering   \n       event such as delinquency. For these   \n  (a)  types of loan sales, the maximum       \n       potential future payments is           \n       generally the unpaid principal         \n       balance of loans sold measured at the  \n       end of the current reporting period.   \n       Actual losses will be significantly    \n       less than the maximum exposure, as     \n       only a fraction of loans sold will     \n       have a representation and warranty     \n       breach, and any losses on repurchase   \n       would generally be mitigated by any    \n       collateral held against the loans.     \n                                              \nMerchant Processing The Company, through its  \nsubsidiaries, provides merchant processing    \nservices. Under the rules of credit card      \nassociations, a merchant processor retains a  \ncontingent liability for credit card          \ntransactions processed. This contingent       \nliability arises in the event of a billing    \ndispute between the merchant and a cardholder \nthat is ultimately resolved in the            \ncardholder\u2019s favor. In this situation, the    \ntransaction is \u201ccharged-back\u201d to the merchant \nand the disputed amount is credited or        \notherwise refunded to the cardholder. If the  \nCompany is unable to collect this amount from \nthe merchant, it bears the loss for the amount\nof the refund paid to the cardholder.         \n                                              \nThe Company currently processes card          \ntransactions in the United States, Canada and \nEurope through wholly-owned subsidiaries. In  \nthe event a merchant was unable to fulfill    \nproduct or services subject to future         \ndelivery, such as airline tickets, the Company\ncould become financially liable for refunding \nthe purchase price of such products or        \nservices purchased through the credit card    \nassociations under the charge-back provisions.\nCharge-back risk related to these merchants is\nevaluated in a manner similar to credit risk  \nassessments and, as such, merchant processing \ncontracts contain various provisions to       \nprotect the Company in the event of default.  \nAt March 31, 2022, the value of airline       \ntickets purchased to be delivered at a future \ndate through card transactions processed by   \nthe Company was $ 7.7billion. The Company held\ncollateral of $ 714million in escrow deposits,\nletters of credit and indemnities from        \nfinancial institutions, and liens on various  \nassets. In addition to specific collateral or \nother credit enhancements, the Company        \nmaintains a liability for its implied         \nguarantees associated with future delivery. At\nMarch 31, 2022, the liability was $ 90million \nprimarily related to these airline processing \narrangements.                                 \n                      \n  66    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n  Table of Contents Asset Sales The Company   \n regularly sells loans to GSEs as part of its \n   mortgage banking activities. The Company   \n    provides customary representations and    \n warranties to GSEs in conjunction with these \n sales. These representations and warranties  \n generally require the Company to repurchase  \nassets if it is subsequently determined that a\nloan did not meet specified criteria, such as \n a documentation deficiency or rescission of  \n mortgage insurance. If the Company is unable \n to cure or refute a repurchase request, the  \n Company is generally obligated to repurchase \n the loan or otherwise reimburse the GSE for  \n  losses. At March 31, 2022, the Company had  \nreserved $ 15million for potential losses from\n   representation and warranty obligations,   \n  compared with $ 18million at December 31,   \n     2021. The Company\u2019s reserve reflects     \n   management\u2019s best estimate of losses for   \n representation and warranty obligations. The \nCompany\u2019s repurchase reserve is modeled at the\n  loan level, taking into consideration the   \n    individual credit quality and borrower    \n      activity that has transpired since      \norigination. The model applies credit quality \n    and economic risk factors to derive a     \n     probability of default and potential     \n  repurchase that are based on the Company\u2019s  \nhistorical loss experience, and estimates loss\n severity based on expected collateral value. \nThe Company also considers qualitative factors\n    that may result in anticipated losses     \n    differing from historical loss trends.    \nAs of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,   \nthe Company had $ 27million and $ 19million,  \nrespectively, of unresolved representation and\nwarranty claims from GSEs. The Company does   \nnot have a significant amount of unresolved   \nclaims from investors other than GSEs.        \nLitigation and Regulatory Matters The Company \nis subject to various litigation and          \nregulatory matters that arise in the ordinary \ncourse of its business. The Company           \nestablishes reserves for such matters when    \npotential losses become probable and can be   \nreasonably estimated. The Company believes the\nultimate resolution of existing legal and     \nregulatory matters will not have a material   \nadverse effect on the financial condition,    \nresults of operations or cash flows of the    \nCompany. However, in light of the             \nuncertainties inherent in these matters, it is\npossible that the ultimate resolution of one  \nor more of these matters may have a material  \nadverse effect on the Company\u2019s results from  \noperations for a particular period, and future\nchanges in circumstances or additional        \ninformation could result in additional        \naccruals or resolution in excess of           \nestablished accruals, which could adversely   \naffect the Company\u2019s results from operations, \npotentially materially. Residential Mortgage- \nBacked Securities Litigation Starting in 2011,\nthe Company and other large financial         \ninstitutions have been sued in their capacity \nas trustee for residential mortgage\u2013backed    \nsecurities trusts. In the lawsuits brought    \nagainst the Company, the investors allege that\nthe Company\u2019s banking subsidiary, U.S. Bank   \nNational Association (\u201cU.S. Bank\u201d), as trustee\ncaused them to incur substantial losses by    \nfailing to enforce loan repurchase obligations\nand failing to abide by appropriate standards \nof care after events of default allegedly     \noccurred. The plaintiffs in these matters seek\nmonetary damages in unspecified amounts and   \nmost also seek equitable relief. Regulatory   \nMatters The Company is continually subject to \nexaminations, inquiries and investigations in \nareas of heightened regulatory scrutiny, such \nas compliance, risk management, third-party   \nrisk management and consumer protection. For  \nexample, the Consumer Financial Protection    \nBureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) has been investigating certain\nof the Company\u2019s consumer sales practices and \nis now considering a potential enforcement    \naction. The Company is engaged in discussions \nwith the CFPB on this matter and does not     \nbelieve an enforcement action is warranted,   \nbut there can be no assurance that these      \ndiscussions will result in a resolution. The  \nCompany is cooperating fully with all pending \nexaminations, inquiries and investigations,   \nany of which could lead to administrative or  \nlegal proceedings or settlements. Remedies in \nthese proceedings or settlements may include  \nfines, penalties, restitution or alterations  \nin the Company\u2019s business practices (which may\nincrease the Company\u2019s operating expenses and \ndecrease its revenue). Outlook Due to their   \ncomplex nature, it can be years before        \nlitigation and regulatory matters are         \nresolved. The Company may be unable to develop\nan estimate or range of loss where matters are\nin early stages, there are significant factual\nor legal issues to be resolved, damages are   \nunspecified or uncertain, or there is         \nuncertainty as to a litigation class being    \ncertified or the outcome of pending motions,  \nappeals or proceedings. For those litigation  \nand regulatory matters where the Company has  \ninformation to develop an estimate or range of\nloss, the Company believes the upper end of   \nthe range of reasonably possible losses in    \naggregate, in excess of any reserves          \nestablished for matters where a loss is       \nconsidered probable, will not be material to  \nits financial condition, results of operations\nor cash flows. The Company\u2019s estimates are    \nsubject to significant judgment and           \nuncertainties, and the matters underlying the \nestimates will change from time to time.      \nActual results may vary significantly from the\ncurrent estimates.                            \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    67  \n                      \nTable of Contents\n                                 \n  Note\u00a0\u00a017    Business Segments  \n                                 \nWithin the Company, financial performance is  \nmeasured by major lines of business based on  \nthe products and services provided to         \ncustomers through its distribution channels.  \nThese operating segments are components of the\nCompany about which financial information is  \nprepared and is evaluated regularly by        \nmanagement in deciding how to allocate        \nresources and assess performance. The Company \nhas five reportable operating segments:       \nCorporate and Commercial Banking Corporate and\nCommercial Banking offers lending, equipment  \nfinance and small-ticketleasing, depository   \nservices, treasury management, capital markets\nservices, international trade services and    \nother financial services to middle market,    \nlarge corporate, commercial real estate,      \nfinancial institution, non-profitand public   \nsector clients.                               \nConsumer and Business Banking Consumer and    \nBusiness Banking delivers products and        \nservices through banking offices, telephone   \nservicing and sales, on-lineservices, direct  \nmail, ATM processing and mobile devices.

The allowance\nfor credit losses and related provision       \nexpense are allocated to the business segments\naccording to the volume and credit quality of \nthe loan balances managed, but with the impact\nof changes in economic forecasts recorded in  \nTreasury and Corporate Support. Goodwill and  \nother intangible assets are assigned to the   \nbusiness segments based on the mix of business\nof an entity acquired by the Company. Within  \nthe Company, capital levels are evaluated and \nmanaged centrally; however, capital is        \nallocated to the business segments to support \nevaluation of business performance. Business  \nsegments are allocated capital on a risk-     \nadjusted basis considering economic and       \nregulatory capital requirements. Generally,   \nthe determination of the amount of capital    \nallocated to each business segment includes   \ncredit allocations following a Basel III      \nregulatory framework. Interest income and     \nexpense is determined based on the assets and \nliabilities managed by the business segment.  \nBecause funding and asset/liability management\nis a central function, funds transfer-pricing \nmethodologies are utilized to allocate a cost \nof funds used or credit for funds provided to \nall business segment assets and liabilities,  \nrespectively, using a matched funding concept.\nAlso, each business unit is allocated the     \ntaxable-equivalent benefit of tax-            \nexemptproducts. The residual effect on net    \ninterest income of asset/liability management \nactivities is included in Treasury and        \nCorporate Support. Noninterest income and     \nexpenses directly managed by each business    \nsegment, including fees, service charges,     \nsalaries and benefits, and other direct       \nrevenues and costs are accounted for within   \neach segment\u2019s financial results in a manner  \nsimilar to the consolidated financial         \nstatements. Occupancy costs are allocated     \nbased on utilization of facilities by the     \nbusiness segments. Generally, operating losses\nare charged to the business segment when the  \nloss event is realized in a manner similar to \na loan charge-off.Noninterest expenses        \nincurred by centrally managed operations or   \nbusiness segments that directly support       \nanother business segment\u2019s operations are     \ncharged to the applicable business segment    \nbased on its utilization of those services,   \nprimarily measured by the volume of customer  \nactivities, number of employees or other      \nrelevant factors. These allocated expenses are\nreported as net shared services expense within\nnoninterest expense. Certain activities that  \ndo not directly support the operations of the \nbusiness segments or for which the business   \nsegments are not considered financially       \naccountable in evaluating their performance   \nare not charged to the business segments. The \nincome or expenses associated with these      \ncorporate activities is reported within the   \nTreasury and Corporate Support business       \nsegment.
