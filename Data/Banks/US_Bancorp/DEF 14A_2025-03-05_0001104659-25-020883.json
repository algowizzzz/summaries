Gunjan has more\nthan 30 years of experience in the financial\nservices industry, serving most recently as\nthe company\u2019s president and having previously\nled our Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and\nInstitutional Banking and Wealth Management\nand Investment Services business lines.

As a\nBoard, we remain focused on our oversight of\nthe company\u2019s business strategy, risk\nmanagement and management team.

All\ndirectors are elected annually to serve one-\nyear terms until the next annual meeting and\nuntil their successors are elected and\nqualified. Fourteen of our current directors\nhave been nominated for election by the Board\nto hold office until the 2026 annual meeting\nand the election of their successors. After\nten years of dedicated service on our Board,\nincluding most recently as chair of the\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee and\na member of the Governance Committee, Scott W.\nWine informed the Board that he would not\nstand for re-election following expiration of\nhis current term at the 2025 annual meeting.\nIn light of Mr. Wine\u2019s departure from the\nBoard, the size of our Board will be reduced\nto 14 as of our 2025 annual meeting. All of\nthe nominees currently serve on our Board. The\nBoard elected Aleem Gillani as a director in\nJuly 2024 and Gunjan Kedia as a director in\nJanuary 2025, and both are standing for\nelection for the first time at the annual\nmeeting. Each of the other nominees has\npreviously been elected by our shareholders.\nThe Board has determined that, except for\nAndrew Cecere, our Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer, and Gunjan Kedia, our\nPresident, each nominee for election as a\ndirector at the annual meeting is independent\nfrom U.S. Bancorp as discussed later in this\nproxy statement under \u201cCorporate governance \u2014\ndirector independence.\u201d\n                                              \n        \u200b                             FOR      \n        The Board of Directors                \n        recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d               \n        election of each of the               \n        14 director nominees                  \n        below to serve until the              \n        next annual meeting and               \n        the election of their                 \n        successors.                           \n                                              \nDirector selection and nomination\nconsiderations Director nominee selection\nprocess The selection process for first-time\ndirector candidates includes the following\nsteps: \u25b6 identification of one or more desired\nprofiles for director candidates based on the\nmost recent assessment of the skill sets\nrepresented on the Board compared to the\nBoard\u2019s needs, as well as feedback received\nfrom the Board evaluation process; \u25b6\nidentification of candidates by the Governance\nCommittee based upon information provided by a\ndirector search firm, suggestions from current\ndirectors and executive officers, and any\nrecommendations received from shareholders and\nother sources; \u25b6 interviews of candidates by\nthe Lead Independent Director and other\ndirectors; \u25b6 reports presented to the Board by\nthe Governance Committee on the candidates and\nselection process; \u25b6 recommendations made by\nthe Governance Committee; and \u25b6 election by\nthe Board or formal nomination by the Board\nfor inclusion in the slate of directors at the\nannual meeting. During 2024, Mr. Gillani was\nidentified by a third-party search firm\nengaged by the Governance Committee to help\nidentify and evaluate individuals for\ninclusion in the potential pool of director\ncandidates, and was appointed to the Board\nfollowing the Governance Committee\u2019s and the\nBoard\u2019s review and evaluation process. A\nshareholder seeking to recommend a prospective\ncandidate for the Governance Committee\u2019s\nconsideration should submit the candidate\u2019s\nname and sufficient written information about\nthe candidate to permit a determination by the\nGovernance Committee of whether the candidate\nmeets the director selection criteria set\nforth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.\nRecommendations should be sent to the Chair of\nthe Governance Committee in care of the\nCorporate Secretary of U.S. Bancorp at the\naddress listed on page 92 of this proxy\nstatement. Board refreshment and nomination\nconsiderations Our Governance Committee\ncontinuously assesses the evolving\nopportunities and challenges facing our\ncompany in order to align the Board\u2019s\ncomposition with our company\u2019s leadership\nneeds and strategic direction. The Governance\nCommittee evaluates the composition of the\nBoard against the company\u2019s needs every year,\nwhich culminates in the process of nominating\nnew and incumbent directors.\n                                              \n    10      U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 1 \u2014 Election of\ndirectors The Governance Committee\u2019s decision\nto renominate an incumbent director is\ninformed by the director\u2019s past attendance at\nmeetings, participation in the work of the\nBoard and overall contribution to the Board,\nas assessed in the annual Board evaluation\nprocess. The Board\u2019s commitment to refreshment\ncan require candid conversations with\nindividual directors when the Governance\nCommittee has determined that a different\nBoard composition would increase the Board\u2019s\neffectiveness. As a result of the Board\nevaluation and skills-to-strategy alignment\nprocesses, directors may decide or be asked\nnot to stand for re-election at the next\nannual meeting. When a new director is sought,\nthe Governance Committee considers the\nfollowing factors: \u25b6 Skills and\nqualifications:When considering the skills and\nbackgrounds desirable in future Board members,\nthe Governance Committee identifies the\nprofessional experience and skill sets\nrepresented on the Board and compares them to\nthe skill sets that the Governance Committee\nbelieves is important to have represented\namong the directors at any given time in light\nof the company\u2019s current business, strategy,\nrisks and opportunities. Any gaps become focus\nareas for director search efforts. See below\nfor additional information on our directors\u2019\nskills and qualifications. \u25b6 Personal\nqualities:The Governance Committee will only\nconsider as candidates for director\nindividuals who possess the highest personal\nand professional ethics and integrity, and who\nare committed to representing the long-term\ninterests of all our stakeholders. Directors\nmust be able to work in a collegial manner\nwith persons of different educational,\nbusiness and cultural backgrounds. \u25b6 Board\ncomposition:As required by our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, our Governance\nCommittee is responsible for ensuring that the\nBoard\u2019s composition reflects a mix of members\nrepresenting various backgrounds,\nperspectives, industries, skills, and\nprofessional experiences because the Board\nbenefits from a variety of perspectives,\nexperiences and skill sets in exercising its\noversight role. Our Governance Committee\nregularly reviews the composition of the Board\nin light of those factors and other personal\nqualities and attributes represented by the\nBoard\u2019s current members. The Governance\nCommittee incorporates this broad view of\nboard composition into its director nomination\nprocess and is committed to ensuring that the\nBoard\u2019s composition appropriately reflects the\ncurrent and anticipated needs of the Board and\nour company. \u25b6 Capacity:Serving on the board\nof a large financial institution requires a\nsignificant commitment of time and energy, and\ndirectors must be willing and able to devote\nsufficient attention to carrying out their\nduties and responsibilities effectively. The\nGovernance Committee will consider the\nprofessional and other demands placed on\ncandidates, including service on the boards of\nother public or private companies. Unless the\nBoard determines that a director\u2019s service to\nour company would not be impaired, a director\nmay not serve on more than three other boards\nof public companies in addition to our Board,\nand a director who serves as the CEO of a\npublic company may not serve on more than one\npublic company board in addition to our Board\n(including the board of the company of which\nhe or she serves as CEO). \u25b6 Tenure and\nrefreshment:Our Governance Committee believes\nthat it is important to maintain a balance of\ntenure on the Board to benefit from the\nbusiness, industry and governance experience\nof longer-serving directors and the fresh\nperspectives contributed by new directors,\nwhile recognizing the value of continuity as\nBoard composition changes. Our Governance\nCommittee aims to have a measured rate of\nBoard refreshment. \u25b6 Retirement and other\nconsiderations for incumbent directors:In\naddition to the factors stated above, the\nGovernance Committee will evaluate any\ndirector\u2019s continued service on the Board for\nappropriateness in each of the following\ncircumstances: the director has a change in\nemployment or other major responsibilities; an\nemployee director ceases to be a company\nemployee; and the director has reached the age\nof 72 since the last meeting of shareholders\nat which the director was elected.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy             11    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 1 \u2014 Election of\ndirectors\n\nSkills and qualifications of our director\nnominees The Governance Committee has\nidentified certain skills, experiences and\nprofessional qualifications that are important\nto be represented on the Board for strong\ncollective oversight of the company\u2019s business\nand strategy. These skills and qualifications,\nalong with the ways these experiences\ncontribute to the Board\u2019s collective oversight\nof the development and execution of the\ncompany\u2019s strategy, are

Good corporate\ngovernance is vital to our continued success.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines to provide a corporate\ngovernance framework for our directors and\nmanagement to effectively pursue our\nobjectives for the benefit of our\nshareholders. The Board reviews and updates\nthese guidelines and the charters of the Board\ncommittees at least annually in response to\nevolving best practices and business needs, as\nwell as the results of annual Board and\ncommittee evaluations. Our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines can be found at\nusbank.com by clicking on \u201cAbout us\u201d,\n\u201cInvestor relations\u201d, \u201cCorporate Governance\u201d\nand then \u201cGovernance documents.\u201d Director\nindependence Our Board of Directors has\ndetermined that each of the following\ndirectors, comprising all of our current non-\nemployee directors, has no material\nrelationship with U.S. Bancorp and is\nindependent: Warner L. Baxter, Dorothy\nBridges, Elizabeth L. Buse, Alan B. Colberg,\nKimberly N. Ellison-Taylor, Aleem Gillani,\nKimberly J. Harris, Roland A. Hernandez,\nRichard P. McKenney, Yusuf I. Mehdi, Loretta\nE. Reynolds, John P. Wiehoff and Scott W.\nWine. Andrew Cecere and Gunjan Kedia are not\nindependent because each of them is an\nexecutive officer of U.S. Bancorp. Our Board\nhas adopted a set of standards in our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines to assist it\nin assessing the independence of each of our\nnon-employee directors. A director of U.S.\nBancorp who meets the independence\nqualifications of the New York Stock Exchange\n(NYSE) listing standards may be deemed\n\u201cindependent\u201d by the Board of Directors after\nconsideration of the relationships between\nU.S. Bancorp or any of its affiliates and the\ndirector or any of his or her immediate family\nmembers or other related parties. Our Board\ndeems the following relationships to be\ncategorically immaterial such that they will\nnot, by themselves, affect an independence\ndetermination: \u25b6 a relationship between our\ncompany and an organization of which the\ndirector or a member of his or her immediate\nfamily is an executive officer if that role\ndoes not constitute that person\u2019s principal\noccupation; \u25b6 an ordinary banking relationship\nfor services readily available from other\nlarge financial institutions; \u25b6 employment by\nour company of a member of the director\u2019s\nimmediate family if that person\u2019s annual\ncompensation does not exceed $120,000; and \u25b6 a\nrelationship between our company and an\norganization with which the director or a\nmember of his or her immediate family is\naffiliated if (a) the relationship arises in\nthe ordinary course of both parties\u2019\noperations and (b) the aggregate annual amount\ninvolved does not exceed $120,000. The only\nrelationship between U.S. Bancorp and our\ndirectors or the directors\u2019 related interests\nthat was considered by the Board when\nassessing the independence of our non-employee\ndirectors is the relationship between U.S.\nBancorp and Microsoft Corporation, a\ncorporation with which our director Yusuf I.\nMehdi is affiliated. The Board determined that\nthis relationships, which is described later\nin this proxy statement under the heading\n\u201cRelated person transactions,\u201d does not impair\nMr. Mehdi\u2019s independence. This determination\nwas based on the Board\u2019s conclusion that the\namounts involved in transactions between U.S.\nBancorp and Microsoft are immaterial to\nMicrosoft\u2019s gross revenues and that the\nrelationships had no unique characteristics\nthat could influence Mr. Mehdi\u2019s impartial\njudgment as a director of U.S. Bancorp.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy             23    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance\n\nBoard leadership structure Board leadership\npolicies and practices Our Board believes that\na strong, independent Board of Directors is\ncritical to effective oversight of management.\nThe Board carefully considers the important\nissue of the best independent leadership\nstructure for the Board and maintains a\nflexible policy regarding the issue of whether\nthe position of Chairman should be held by an\nindependent director. At least annually, the\nBoard reviews the Board\u2019s and company\u2019s needs\nand the leadership attributes of its directors\nand executives to determine whether our\ncompany is best served at that particular time\nby having the CEO or another director hold the\nposition of Chairman. In order to provide\nstrong independent Board leadership when the\nposition of Chairman is not held by an\nindependent director, the independent\ndirectors elect a Lead Independent Director\nwith the substantial leadership\nresponsibilities detailed below. The Lead\nIndependent Director is elected annually upon\nthe recommendation of the Governance\nCommittee, with the expectation that he or she\nwill generally serve three, and may serve up\nto five, consecutive terms. In addition, our\nLead Independent Director is empowered with,\nand exercises, robust and well-defined duties\nreflected in our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines and summarized below. In addition\nto strong independent leadership of the full\nBoard, each of the Audit Committee, Governance\nCommittee, and Compensation and Human\nResources Committee is composed solely of\nindependent directors. Independent directors,\ntherefore, oversee critical, risk-sensitive\nmatters such as the quality and integrity of\nour financial statements; the compensation of\nour executive officers, including the CEO; the\nnomination of directors; and the evaluation of\nthe Board, its committees and its members.\nEach of the remaining committees, aside from\nthe Executive Committee, is chaired by an\nindependent director. The full Board and each\nof its committees meet in executive session on\na regular basis. Leadership decisions in 2025\nAndrew Cecere, our Chief Executive Officer,\nhas served as Chairman of the Board since the\ndate of the 2018 annual meeting. Following our\nannual meeting on April 15, 2025, Gunjan\nKedia, our current President, who has 30 years\nof financial services industry experience and\nhas held executive leadership roles in the\ncompany since 2016, will succeed Mr. Cecere as\nour CEO and Mr. Cecere will continue serving\nas Chairman of the Board. The independent\ndirectors believe that Mr. Cecere\u2019s continued\nleadership of the Board will constitute a\nvaluable resource to the Board and Ms. Kedia,\nand will help facilitate a smooth transition\nof the CEO role. In addition, having the\nformer CEO serve as the Executive Chairman and\nhaving the incoming CEO serve as a director\nwill create a strong bridge between the Board\nand management during the transition. The\nBoard also will continue to benefit from the\nindependent leadership provided by a strong\nLead Independent Director. Roland A. Hernandez\nhas served as the Board\u2019s Lead Independent\nDirector since our 2023 annual meeting.\nExecutive Chairman Mr. Cecere, who has nearly\n40 years of experience at U.S. Bancorp,\nincluding nearly eight years as CEO and eight\nyears as Chief Financial Officer, has the\nknowledge, expertise and experience to\nunderstand and clearly articulate to the Board\nthe opportunities and risks facing our company\nand to lead discussions on important matters\naffecting our business.\n                                              \n      Role of Executive Chairman              \n      The primary responsibilities of         \n      the Executive Chairman will be as       \n      follows:                                \n      \u25b6                                       \n      set Board meeting agendas in            \n      collaboration with the Lead             \n      Independent Director, who has           \n      final approval authority over           \n      them;                                   \n      \u200b                                        \n      \u25b6                                       \n      preside at Board meetings, guiding      \n      discussion and ensuring that            \n      decisions are made;                     \n      \u200b                                        \n      \u25b6                                       \n      provide support and advice on           \n      Board matters to the incoming CEO;      \n      \u200b                                        \n      \u25b6                                       \n      help ensure that the Board is           \n      provided with full information on       \n      our company and its industry;           \n      \u200b                                        \n      \u25b6                                       \n      set shareholder meeting agendas in      \n      collaboration with the CEO,             \n      subject to approval by the Board,       \n      and preside at meetings of the          \n      shareholders; and                       \n      \u200b                                        \n      \u25b6                                       \n      chair the Board\u2019s Executive             \n      Committee.                              \n      \u200b                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n    24      U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance\n\nLead Independent Director Mr. Hernandez brings\ndeep business and board leadership experience\nto his role as Lead Independent Director.

The Audit\nCommittee charter generally prohibits Audit\nCommittee members from serving on more than\ntwo other public company audit committees.\nCurrently, no Audit Committee member exceeds\nthis limitation. At all times, one or more\nmembers of our Audit Committee possess the\neducation or experience required to qualify as\nan \u201caudit committee financial expert\u201d as\ndefined by the SEC, and one or more members of\nour Risk Management Committee have experience\nidentifying, assessing and managing the risk\nexposures of large, complex financial firms,\nin accordance with rules promulgated by the\nFederal Reserve Board. Compensation Committee\ninterlocks and insider participation Warner L.\nBaxter, Kimberly J. Harris, Roland A.\nHernandez and Scott W. Wine served as members\nof the Compensation and Human Resources\nCommittee during 2024. During 2024, no member\nof the Compensation and Human Resources\nCommittee was an employee, officer, or former\nofficer of the company. None of our executive\nofficers served in 2024 on the board of\ndirectors or compensation committee (or other\ncommittee serving an equivalent function) of\nany entity that had an executive officer\nserving as a member of our Board or the\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee. As\ndescribed under the \u201cRelated person\ntransactions\u201d section of this proxy statement,\nin 2024, some Compensation and Human Resources\nCommittee members had transactions in the\nordinary course of business with our banking\nand broker-dealer subsidiaries. Majority vote\nstandard for election of directors Our bylaws\nprovide that in uncontested elections, a\nnominee for director will be elected to the\nBoard if the number of votes cast \u201cFOR\u201d the\nnominee\u2019s election exceeds the number of votes\ncast \u201cAGAINST\u201d that nominee\u2019s election (votes\nto \u201cABSTAIN\u201d have no effect on the election of\na director). The voting standard for directors\nin a contested election is a plurality of the\nvotes cast at the meeting. Our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines provide that director\nnominees must submit a contingent resignation\nin writing to the Governance Committee, which\nbecomes effective if the director fails to\nreceive a sufficient number of votes for re-\nelection at the annual meeting of shareholders\nand the Board accepts the resignation. The\nBoard will nominate for election or re-\nelection as director only candidates who have\ntendered such a contingent resignation. Our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines further\nprovide that if an incumbent director fails to\nreceive the required vote for re-election, our\nGovernance Committee will act within 90 days\nafter certification of the shareholder vote to\ndetermine whether to accept the director\u2019s\nresignation, and will submit a recommendation\nfor prompt consideration by the Board. The\nBoard expects the director whose resignation\nis under consideration to abstain from\nparticipating in any decision regarding his or\nher resignation. The Governance Committee and\nthe Board may consider any factors they deem\nrelevant in deciding whether to accept a\ndirector\u2019s resignation.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy             29    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance Board\nperformance evaluations Our Board continually\nseeks to improve its performance. Our\nGovernance Committee conducts an annual\nassessment of the Board\u2019s performance to\ndetermine whether the Board, its committees\nand its members are functioning effectively\nand to identify areas for growth and\nimprovement. We believe that our formal annual\nevaluation process contributes to the overall\nfunctioning and ongoing effectiveness of our\nBoard. The annual process is as follows:\n                                              \n    30      U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance Based\non director feedback received over the last\nseveral years through this annual evaluation\nprocess and other channels, including feedback\nprovided by directors at meetings, management\nhas continued to leverage executive summaries\nand highlights pages for committee meeting\nmaterials, bring timely focus topics for\ndiscussion at appropriate Board and committee\nmeetings, and augment the director education\nand onboarding processes. In addition, the\nGovernance Committee has received information\nabout the skills and qualifications that\ndirectors would like future Board or committee\nmembers to have, information the Board would\nlike to discuss as part of its annual strategy\nsession and ongoing updates on the company\u2019s\nbusiness and strategy, the continued\nimportance of an appropriate mix of\nexperience, skills and perspectives on the\nBoard, the content of committee chair reports\nto the full Board, and topics for discussion\nat future Board meetings and Board education\nsessions. Director feedback has also led to\ndiscussion of how to appropriately balance\noversight responsibility for critical matters\naffecting our company among the Board and its\ncommittees. Director orientation and\nonboarding We conduct a comprehensive director\nonboarding program that is individually\ntailored to take into account a director\u2019s\nprior experience and background. New directors\nreceive an orientation to the company and the\nBoard that includes comprehensive background\nbriefings by the Chief Executive Officer,\nother members of senior management, and the\nCorporate Secretary. New director orientation\ncovers a review of the company\u2019s business\nlines, enterprise functions, risk management\nand compliance, strategy, financial statement\nand related matters, regulatory matters,\ninternal and external audit matters, corporate\ngovernance, cybersecurity, technology and\noperations initiatives, and key policies and\npractices (including the company\u2019s Code of\nEthics and Business Conduct), as well as the\nrole and responsibilities of a director. New\ndirector onboarding and orientation may occur\nover the course of several months and\ncontinues to be enhanced based on best\npractices and director feedback. The\nonboarding program is regularly updated based\non director feedback to facilitate integration\nof new directors on the Board. Director\neducation Continuing director education is an\nimportant element of maintaining a strong\nBoard of Directors. It is important for our\ndirectors to continually receive additional\ninformation and training that will help them\nto effectively oversee the management of our\ncompany. We have implemented a robust director\neducation program that begins with in-depth\ntraining covering our industry and each of our\nlines of business, and that continues with\nspecial education sessions throughout the year\nthat highlight current business, industry,\nregulatory and governance topics presented by\ninternal and external experts. Separate Board\neducation sessions held in 2024 focused on\nbusiness, strategy, asset and liability\nmanagement, global capital markets, corporate\nreal estate, and cybersecurity topics. These\neducation sessions are in addition to any\neducation components of regular updates on\nbusiness line performance and key and emerging\ntopics provided to the Board and each of its\ncommittees throughout the year. Directors are\nalso encouraged to attend continuing training\nsessions offered by outside providers on\ntopics related to general corporate governance\nas well as specialized areas in risk\nmanagement, audit, compensation and other\nmatters, at the company\u2019s expense. Management\nmakes information available to all directors\non a quarterly basis about upcoming external\ndirector education programs. Ethics and\nconduct We are deeply committed to maintaining\nthe highest standards of ethical conduct that\nreflect our purpose and core values, and which\nallow us to build trust with our customers and\nthe communities we serve. In recognition of\nthat commitment, for the tenth consecutive\nyear, we were recognized as one of the World\u2019s\nMost Ethical Companies\u00ae in 2024 by the\nEthisphere Institute. Our Code of Ethics and\nBusiness Conduct, which is available on our\nwebsite at usbank.com by clicking on \u201cAbout\nus\u201d, \u201cInvestor relations\u201d, \u201cCorporate\nGovernance\u201d and then \u201cGovernance documents\u201d,\noutlines the responsibilities of every\nemployee and director to our customers and\nbusiness partners, our shareholders, our\ncommunity and each other. Succession planning\nand management development A primary\nresponsibility of the Board is planning for\nCEO succession, as well as overseeing\nsuccession planning for other senior\nmanagement positions, to ensure that we have\nthe right executive management talent to\npursue our strategic goals. The Board\u2019s\nprocess targets the building of enhanced\nmanagement depth and skills, considers\ncontinuity and stability within our company,\nand responds to our company\u2019s evolving needs\nand changing circumstances. To achieve these\ngoals, the executive talent development and\nsuccession planning process is integrated into\nthe Board\u2019s annual activities.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy             31    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance\n\nThe Governance Committee has established a CEO\nsuccession planning process that considers the\nexperience, leadership capabilities, skills\nand attributes that the Board believes are\nmost critical to leadership of the company in\nlight of our business strategy, and includes\nongoing targeted executive development actions\nand evaluation of a number of potential\ninternal and external successor candidates,\nwhile addressing emergency, temporary\nscenarios as well as long-term succession. The\nCEO makes available to the Board his or her\nrecommendations and evaluations of potential\ninternal successors, along with a review of\nany executive development plans recommended\nfor those individuals. The Compensation and\nHuman Resources Committee is responsible for\nreviewing succession planning at least\nannually for executive officer positions other\nthan the CEO. Those succession plans are\ndiscussed with the Board on an annual basis.\nThe Board also has opportunities to receive\npresentations from members of senior\nmanagement leading various business units or\nenabling functions at Board meetings as well\nas strategy and education sessions. These\ninteractions provide Board members the ability\nto meet with, and assess the leadership\ncapabilities and development plans for, those\nsenior leaders as necessary from time to time.\nCEO succession planning process Following the\nsuccessful execution of a deliberate, multi-\nyear CEO succession planning process, the\nBoard announced on January 28, 2025 that\nGunjan Kedia was elected to the Board\neffective January 28, 2025 and will become the\nCEO of U.S. Bancorp following the company\u2019s\nannual shareholders\u2019 meeting on April 15,\n2025. On April 15, 2025, Andrew Cecere will\ntransition to the role of Executive Chairman.\n\u25b6 In reaching their decision, the Governance\nCommittee and the Board relied upon its pre-\nestablished succession planning process that\nconsiders the necessary experience, leadership\ncapabilities, skills and attributes critical\nto the role and leadership of our company. \u25b6\nThe Board\u2019s process spanned over multiple\nyears, including ongoing targeted executive\ndevelopment actions, the retention of a third-\nparty search firm, and evaluation of several\npotential internal and external candidates.\nShareholder engagement We value the views of\nour investors and welcome feedback from them.\nOur standard engagement practice is to\ninitiate conversations with our largest\ninvestors each fall. In the fall of 2024, we\nreached out to our top 50 and certain other\ninstitutional investors and invited them to\nprovide us feedback on corporate governance\nexecutive compensation and other disclosure\nmatters, and any other topics they wished to\ndiscuss. We also engage throughout the year\nwith additional shareholders, including at\ntheir request, outside of our fall outreach\neffort.\n                                              \n    Cont\u2026                             We      \n    our              Held             eng\u2026    \n    top              enga\u2026            with    \n    50in\u2026            calls            add\u2026    \n    inve\u2026            with             inv\u2026    \n    as               15               who     \n    part\u2026            inst\u2026            con\u2026    \n    our              inve\u2026            us      \n    fall             duri\u2026            dir\u2026    \n    outr\u2026            fall             to      \n    prog\u2026            2024             eng\u2026    \n    (~56%            (~19%            on      \n    of               of               spe\u2026    \n    shar\u2026            shar\u2026            top\u2026    \n    outs\u2026            outs\u2026            of      \n                                      int\u2026    \n                                              \nManagement shares the feedback received from\nshareholders with the Governance Committee,\nand feedback that relates to matters that are\nspecifically overseen by a different Board\ncommittee are also provided to those\ncommittees.

This framework includes the\ncompany\u2019s Risk Appetite Statement that sets\nboundaries for the types and amount of risk\nthat may be undertaken in pursuing business\nobjectives and initiatives. Under this\nFramework, and in furtherance of the company\u2019s\nRisk Appetite Statement, the company has\ndefined qualitative statements and\nquantitative metrics, in the form of a Risk\nAppetite Scorecard, with defined limits for\nmonitoring risk appetite across all risk\ncategories. They are complemented by business\nline concentration and risk metrics and both\nare incorporated into key business processes,\nincluding strategic planning, stress testing,\nbusiness change management and incentive\ncompensation programs. Since 2023, all changes\nto metrics between annual Risk Appetite\nStatement reviews are reviewed and approved by\nthe Board\u2019s Risk Management Committee. The\nBoard of Directors oversees management\u2019s\nperformance relative to the Risk Management\nFramework, Risk Appetite Statement, company\nRisk Appetite Scorecard and other policy\nrequirements. While management is responsible\nfor defining the various risks facing our\ncompany, formulating risk management policies\nand procedures, and managing risk exposures on\na day-to-day basis, the Board\u2019s responsibility\nis to oversee our company\u2019s risk management\nprocesses by informing itself about our\nmaterial risks and evaluating whether\nmanagement has reasonable risk management and\ncontrol processes in place to address those\nmaterial risks. The Board\u2019s risk oversight\nresponsibility is primarily carried out\nthrough its standing committees, as follows:\nThe Risk Management and Audit Committees meet\nannually in joint session to give each\ncommittee the opportunity to review the risk\nareas primarily overseen by the other, and all\nBoard members attend this meeting to benefit\nfrom the discussion. Finally, at each meeting\nof the full Board of Directors, each committee\ngives a detailed report of the matters it\ndiscussed and conclusions it reached during\nits recent meetings.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy             33    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance\n                                              \n      Focus on cybersecurity and              \n      technology risks                        \n      The Board is very focused on the        \n      risks that cybersecurity threats        \n      and technology pose to our company      \n      as a major financial services           \n      institution.

The committees must\ntherefore be confident that an appropriate\nrisk monitoring structure is in place at the\nmanagement level in order to be provided\naccurate and useful informational reports. The\nmanagement-level risk oversight structure is\nrobust. Our company relies on comprehensive\nrisk management processes to identify,\naggregate and measure, manage, and monitor\nrisks. This system enables the Board of\nDirectors to establish a mutual understanding\nwith management of the effectiveness of our\ncompany\u2019s risk management practices and\ncapabilities, to review our company\u2019s risk\nexposure and to elevate certain key risks for\ndiscussion at the Board level. A framework\nexists to account for the introduction of\nemerging risks or any increase in risks\nroutinely taken, which would either be largely\ncontrolled by the risk limits in place or\nidentified through the frequent risk reporting\nthat occurs throughout our company. The\nExecutive Risk Committee, which is chaired by\nour Chief Risk Officer and includes the CEO\nand other members of the executive management\nteam, oversees execution against the Risk\nManagement Framework and company-level Risk\nAppetite Statement. The Executive Risk\nCommittee meets monthly, and more frequently\nwhen circumstances merit, to provide executive\nmanagement oversight of our Risk Management\nFramework, assess appropriate levels of risk\nexposure and actions that may be required for\nidentified risks to be adequately mitigated,\npromote effective management of all risk\ncategories, and foster the establishment and\nmaintenance of an effective risk culture. The\nExecutive Risk Committee members manage large,\nsophisticated groups within our company that\nare dedicated to controlling and monitoring\nrisk to the levels deemed appropriate by the\nBoard of Directors and executive management.\nThese individuals, together with our company\u2019s\nController, Treasurer and others, also provide\nthe Board\u2019s committees with information the\ncommittees need and request in order to carry\nout their oversight responsibilities. The\nExecutive Risk Committee focuses on current\nand emerging risks, including strategic,\nreputational and conduct risks, directing\ntimely and comprehensive actions. Senior\noperating committees have also been\nestablished as part of the risk governance\nstructure under our Risk Management Framework\nto support the work of the Executive Risk\nCommittee, with each having responsibility for\noversight of a specified category of risk. Our\nBoard and management-level governance\ncommittees are supported by a \u201cthree lines of\ndefense\u201d model for establishing effective\nchecks and balances. The first line of\ndefense, the business lines, manages risks in\nconformity with established limits and policy\nrequirements. In turn, business line leaders\nand their risk officers establish programs to\nensure conformity with these limits and policy\nrequirements. The second line of defense,\nwhich includes the Chief Risk Officer\u2019s\norganization as well as policy and oversight\nactivities of corporate support functions,\ntranslates risk appetite and strategy into\nactionable risk limits and policies. The\nsecond line of defense monitors the first line\nof defense conformity with limits and policies\nand provides reporting and escalation of\nemerging risks and other concerns to senior\nmanagement and the Risk Management Committee\nof the Board of Directors. The third line of\ndefense, internal audit, is responsible for\nproviding the Audit Committee and senior\nmanagement with independent assessment and\nassurance regarding the effectiveness of our\ncompany\u2019s governance, risk management and\ncontrol processes.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy             35    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Certain relationships and\nrelated transactions Certain relationships and\nrelated transactions Review of related person\ntransactions The Board has adopted a written\nRelated Person Transactions Policy for the\nreview, evaluation and approval or\nratification of transactions between our\ncompany and its related persons. \u201cRelated\npersons\u201d under this policy include our\ndirectors, director nominees, executive\nofficers, holders of more than 5% of our\ncommon stock, and their respective immediate\nfamily members. \u201cImmediate family members\u201d\ninclude children, stepchildren, parents,\nstepparents, spouses, siblings, mothers- and\nfathers-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law,\nbrothers- and sisters-in-law, and any person\n(other than a tenant or employee) sharing the\nperson\u2019s household. Except as described below,\nthe policy requires the Governance Committee\nof the Board to review and evaluate and either\napprove or disapprove all transactions or\nseries of transactions in which: \u25b6 the amount\ninvolved will, or may be expected to, exceed\n$120,000 in any fiscal year; \u25b6 our company is\nor will be a participant; and \u25b6 a related\nperson has a direct or indirect interest. The\nBoard has determined that the Governance\nCommittee does not need to review or approve\ncertain transactions even if the amount\ninvolved will exceed $120,000, including the\nfollowing transactions: \u25b6 lending and other\nfinancial services transactions or\nrelationships that are in the ordinary course\nof business and non-preferential, and comply\nwith applicable laws; \u25b6 transactions in which\nthe related person\u2019s interest derives solely\nfrom his or her services as a director of,\nand/or his or her ownership of less than ten\npercent of the equity interest (other than a\ngeneral partner interest) in, another\ncorporation or organization that is a party to\nthe transaction; \u25b6 transactions in which the\nrelated person\u2019s interest derives solely from\nhis or her ownership of a class of equity\nsecurities of our company and all holders of\nthat class of equity securities received the\nsame benefit on a pro rata basis; \u25b6\ntransactions where the rates or charges\ninvolved are determined by competitive bids,\nor that involve the rendering of services as a\ncommon or contract carrier, or public utility,\nat rates or charges fixed in conformity with\nlaw or governmental authority; and \u25b6\nemployment and compensation arrangements for\nany executive officer and compensation\narrangements for any director, provided that\nsuch arrangements have been approved by the\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee.\nWhen considering whether to approve or ratify\na transaction, the Governance Committee will\nconsider facts and circumstances that it deems\nrelevant to its determination, including: \u25b6\nthe nature and extent of the related person\u2019s\ninterest in the transaction; \u25b6 whether the\ntransaction is on substantially the same terms\nas those prevailing at the time for comparable\ntransactions with persons not affiliated with\nour company; \u25b6 the materiality of the\ntransaction to each party; \u25b6 whether our\ncompany\u2019s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct\ncould be implicated, including whether the\ntransaction would create a conflict of\ninterest or appearance of a conflict of\ninterest; \u25b6 whether the transaction is in the\nbest interest of our company; and \u25b6 in the\ncase of a non-employee director, whether the\ntransaction would impair his or her\nindependence. No director is allowed to\nparticipate in the deliberations or vote on\nthe approval or ratification of a transaction\nif that director is a related person with\nrespect to the transaction under review. On an\nannual basis, the Governance Committee\nassesses all ongoing relationships with\nrelated persons to confirm that the\ntransactions are still appropriate.\n                                              \n    36      U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Certain relationships and\nrelated transactions Related person\ntransactions Lending and other financial\nservices transactions During 2024, U.S.\nBancorp and our banking and broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries engaged in transactions in the\nordinary course of business with some of our\ndirectors, executive officers and the persons\nthat we know beneficially owned more than 5%\nof our common stock on December 31, 2024\n(BlackRock, Inc. and The Vanguard Group), and\nthe entities with which they are associated.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we\npurchased investment management technology\nproducts and advisory services from BlackRock\nand its affiliates.

This proposal, commonly known as a\n\u201cSay-on-Pay\u201d proposal, gives our shareholders\nthe opportunity to express their views on the\ncompensation of our named executive officers\n(NEOs) in accordance with Section 14A of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the Exchange Act). We have been conducting\nannual advisory votes to approve executive\ncompensation since 2009 and expect to conduct\nthe next advisory vote at our 2026 annual\nmeeting of shareholders. We have designed our\nexecutive compensation program to create long-\nterm shareholder value by attracting and\nretaining talented leaders and rewarding them\nfor top performance. Our company is presenting\nthis proposal, which gives you as a\nshareholder the opportunity to endorse or not\nendorse our executive pay program by voting\n\u201cFOR\u201d or \u201cAGAINST,\u201d or abstaining from voting\non, the following resolution: \u201cRESOLVED, that\nthe shareholders approve, on an advisory\nbasis, the compensation of the named executive\nofficers, as discussed and disclosed in the\nCompensation discussion and analysis section,\nthe compensation tables and the related\ndisclosure contained in this proxy statement\npursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K.\u201d As\ndiscussed in the \u201cCompensation discussion and\nanalysis\u201d section below, the Compensation and\nHuman Resources Committee believes that the\ncompensation of our NEOs in 2024 was\nreasonable and appropriate, reflected the\nperformance of our company and the individual\nperformance of each NEO, and aligned our\nexecutives\u2019 interests with those of our\nshareholders to support long-term value\ncreation. This vote is not intended to address\nany specific item of compensation, but rather\nour overall compensation policies and\nprocedures relating to our NEOs described in\nthis proxy statement. Accordingly, your vote\nwill not directly affect or otherwise limit\nany existing compensation or award arrangement\nof any of our NEOs. Because your vote is\nadvisory, it will not be binding upon the\nBoard of Directors. However, the Board values\nour shareholders\u2019 opinions, and the\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee\nwill take into account the outcome of the vote\nwhen considering future executive compensation\narrangements.\n                                              \n        \u200b                             FOR      \n        The Board of Directors                \n        recommends that you vote              \n        \u201cFOR\u201d approval of the                 \n        compensation of our named             \n        executive officers, as                \n        disclosed in this proxy               \n        statement.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n    38      U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nCompensation discussion and analysis This\nsection explains how we compensated the\nindividuals who served as our CEO or CFO\nduring 2024 and each of our other most highly\ncompensated executive officers for 2024 as\ndetermined under SEC rules (our named\nexecutive officers, or NEOs).

Resources Committee (referred to herein\nas the Committee) considers the views of our\nshareholders, along with industry trends and\nthe specific strategy of our company, when\ndesigning our executive compensation program.\nThe Committee considers the high level of\nsupport for our recent Say on Pay votes \u2014\n93.5% at our 2024 annual meeting and over 92%\nin each of the last seven years \u2014 as a\ncontinuing endorsement from our shareholders\nthat our executive compensation program is\nstructured effectively. The Committee also\nconsidered the 95.3% level of support for the\nU.S. Bancorp 2024 Stock Incentive Plan at the\n2024 annual meeting. In light of this\nsustained level of shareholder support, the\nCommittee did not make any structural changes\nto our 2024 executive compensation program as\na result of the 2024 Say on Pay vote, but has\nmade enhancements to the financial performance\nmetrics for the PRSUs awarded to our executive\nofficers in 2025 to better align our executive\ncompensation program with the company\u2019s\nstrategic plan, long-term shareholder\ninterests, and market practices across the\ncompany\u2019s compensation peer group as described\nbelow in \u201cLong-term incentive awards.\u201d 2024\nperformance-based compensation results Our\n2024 compensation outcomes reflect our pay for\nperformance philosophy, demonstrated through\nincentives that are earned based on\nachievement levels relative to goals that the\nCommittee believes focus on long-term\nshareholder value creation. \u25b6 Payouts for\nNEOs\u2019 2024 annual cash incentive awards ranged\nfrom 98.6% to 101.1% of their respective\ntarget amounts, based on earnings per share\n(EPS) and business line pretax income results\nfor the year. \u25b6 The PRSUs granted in 2022 were\nearned at 126.6% of the NEOs\u2019 respective\ntarget amounts, based on absolute and relative\nreturn on equity (ROE) results for the\n2022-2024 performance period. Our ROE\nperformance was consistently in the top-\nquartile relative to the peer group during\nthat period. Corporate financial performance\nIn 2024, our company delivered solid financial\nperformance and maintained stable credit\nquality as well as a strong capital and\nliquidity position. We delivered positive\noperating leverage on an adjusted basis in the\nsecond half of 2024, reflecting year-over-year\nrevenue growth and continued improvement in\nexpense discipline. The company remained\nfocused on effective balance sheet management\nand prudent capital management while balancing\ncontinued capital accretion with the adoption\nof a new share repurchase program during 2024\nand a modest amount of share repurchases\nduring the fourth quarter of 2024. We achieved\ncontinued growth across our diversified and\ndifferentiated business mix as we demonstrated\nthe benefits of greater \u201cinterconnectedness\u201d\nacross our businesses, including a broad\nproduct set, deep client base, and\ndistribution network, to drive sustainable\ngrowth. Investments in digital capabilities,\ntechnology modernization, scale and\npartnerships and products and services also\nhave positioned us well for long-term growth\nand greater efficiency.\n                                              \n    40      U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nElements of 2024 total direct compensation 1.\nEffective May 5, 2024, following Gunjan\nKedia\u2019s promotion to President.

The Committee achieves\nthis objective through a compensation program\nthat: \u25b6 links a significant portion of total\ncompensation to corporate and business line\nperformance metrics, which we believe serves\nto create long-term shareholder value; \u25b6\nprovides total compensation that is market\ncompetitive, permitting us to hire and retain\nhigh caliber individuals; \u25b6 emphasizes long-\nterm, stock-based compensation, encouraging\nour executive officers to think and act as\nlong-term shareholders; \u25b6 subjects equity\nawards to multi-year performance, vesting and\nretention requirements that enhance executive\nownership and encourage a long-term view of\ncorporate achievement; and \u25b6 encourages an\nappropriate sensitivity to risk on the part of\nsenior management, which protects long-term\nshareholder interests. Pay for performance We\noperate in a highly complex business\nenvironment and compete with both well-\nestablished financial institutions and also\nwith non-banks. Our long-term business\nobjective is to maximize shareholder value by\nconsistently delivering superior returns on\ncommon equity that exceed the cost of equity.\nIf we are successful in achieving this\nobjective, the Committee believes the results\nwill benefit our shareholders. Accordingly,\nour executive compensation program is designed\nto reward our executives for achieving annual\nand long-term financial results that further\nour long-term business objectives. \u25b6 The\nannual cash incentive plan rewards performance\nrelative to corporate EPS and business line\npretax income targets established at the\nbeginning of the fiscal year, with\nconsideration of qualitative factors to\nsupport alignment with additional corporate\npriorities. \u25b6 For PRSUs granted between 2022\nand 2024, NEOs earn PRSUs based on achievement\nof absolute and relative ROE targets over a\nthree-year performance period, which directly\nmeasure the return generated by the company on\nshareholders\u2019 investment. \u25b6 For PRSUs granted\nin 2025, NEOs earn PRSUs based on achievement\nof absolute and relative ROTCE targets over a\nthree-year performance period, which measures\nprofitability and efficiency, and a TSR\nmodifier based on our cumulative three-year\nperformance relative to our financial\nperformance peer group to further align the\ninterests of our executives with the long-term\ninterests of our shareholders. \u25b6 The ultimate\nvalue of both the PRSUs and RSUs earned\ndepends on our long-term financial success, as\nreflected in the price of our common stock. At\nthe same time, the Committee carefully weighs\nthe risks inherent in our executive\ncompensation program against the program\u2019s\ngoals and the company\u2019s risk appetite.\nAdditional discussion of the risk oversight\nundertaken by the Committee can be found below\nunder \u201cDecision making and policies \u2014 Risk\nconsiderations.\u201d Pay levels When determining\nexecutive compensation levels each year, the\nCommittee considers the value of each\ncompensation element as well as the value of\nthe total direct compensation package. Key\nfactors that inform pay levels include the\nfollowing: \u25b6 a review of market data and the\ncompetitive landscape, which includes our\ncomplexity and size relative to our peer\ninstitutions and the comparability of our\nNEOs\u2019 responsibilities to similar roles at\npeer institutions; \u25b6 the performance,\nexperience and expertise of the executive,\nincluding expanded scope of responsibilities\nwhen applicable; \u25b6 internal pay equity within\nthe executive officer group; \u25b6 the company\u2019s\nstrategy and performance; \u25b6 the company\u2019s and\neach individual executive\u2019s risk management;\n                                              \n    42      U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\n\u25b6 business line performance as applicable for\nNEOs; \u25b6 compensation actions applicable to the\nbroader employee base; and \u25b6 key talent\nsuccession planning and retention\nconsiderations. Compensation elements Our\nNEOs\u2019 total direct compensation consists of\nthree elements: \u25b6 Base salary; \u25b6 Annual cash\nincentive awards; and \u25b6 Long-term incentive\ncompensation (comprising 60% PRSUs and 40%\nRSUs). Base salary Base salary is the only\ncomponent of the NEOs\u2019 total direct\ncompensation that is not at risk. The\nCommittee considers the salary of executive\nofficers relative to comparable executives in\nour compensation peer group and may make\nmarket-based adjustments as it deems\nappropriate. Salaries can also be adjusted to\nreflect experience and tenure in a position,\ninternal pay equity within the executive\nofficer group, promotions or increased scope\nof responsibilities, individual performance,\nand retention considerations. 2024 salary\nactions: The Committee adjusted each of the\nNEOs\u2019 base salaries in 2024 primarily to\nreflect competitive market conditions. On May\n3, 2024, the Committee approved an increase in\nMs. Kedia\u2019s base salary to an annualized\namount of $1,000,000, effective May 5, 2024,\nin connection with her promotion to the role\nof President.\n                                              \n               20\u2026               20\u2026          \n    NEO        sa\u2026               sa\u2026          \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n    An\u2026        $    1,\u2026          $    1\u2026      \n    Ce\u2026                                       \n    Jo\u2026                                       \n    C.         $    70\u2026          $    7\u2026      \n    St\u2026                                       \n    Gu\u2026        $    72\u2026          $    1\u2026      \n    Ke\u2026                                       \n    Te\u2026                                       \n    R.         $    78\u2026          $    8\u2026      \n    Do\u2026                                       \n    Sh\u2026                                       \n    M.         $    70\u2026          $    8\u2026      \n    Ko\u2026                                       \n    Ti\u2026                                       \n    A.         $    72\u2026          $    8\u2026      \n    We\u2026                                       \n                                              \n1.

Annual cash incentive awards How\nwe determine our NEOs\u2019 annual cash incentive\nawards All executive officers have the\nopportunity to earn annual cash incentive\nawards under our Annual Executive Incentive\nPlan (the AEIP), which are set at target\nlevels that reflect their roles and\nresponsibilities. Potential payout\nopportunities under the AEIP are designed to\nreward achievement of corporate and business\nline goals. The formula for calculating each\nNEO\u2019s Annual Cash Incentive Payoutunder the\nAEIP consists of the following: \u25b6 Each NEO\u2019s\nTarget Award Amount, which is set by the\nCommittee as a percentage of the NEO\u2019s base\nsalary ( Target Award Percentage); \u25b6 The Final\nBonus Funding Percentageapplicable to each\nNEO, which is calculated based on a\ncombination of corporate EPS and business line\npretax income performance and subject to a\nqualitative review by the Committee; and \u25b6 The\nCommittee\u2019s assessment of each NEO\u2019s\nIndividual Performance and Risk Sensitivity,\nwhich can increase or decrease the value of\nthe Bonus Funding Percentage applied to each\nNEO\u2019s Target Award Amount.

Her\nprorated target award percentage for 2024 was\n243%. Calculating the Final Bonus Funding\nPercentage The Bonus Funding Percentageis\ncalculated using two evenly weighted factors:\n\u25b6 the Corporate Result, which is based on EPS\nperformance for 2024, as adjusted; and \u25b6 the\nBusiness Line Result, which is based on\napplicable business line or corporate pretax\nincome performance for the executive officer.\nThe Committee believes that EPS and pretax\nincome targets are appropriate performance\nmetrics for the executive officers\u2019 annual\ncash incentive awards for the following\nreasons: \u25b6 EPS is a common metric used by\ninvestors to evaluate the profitability of a\ncompany, showing the earnings (net income) we\nmake on each outstanding share of common\nstock; \u25b6 a focus on EPS supports alignment of\nthe interests of the executive officers with\nthose of shareholders; \u25b6 EPS captures elements\nof corporate performance that are beyond those\nof the individual operating business lines,\nsuch as corporate funding policies and the\nmanagement and use of capital; \u25b6 the pretax\nincome targets are the fundamental drivers of\nthe company\u2019s revenues and income before\ntaxes; and \u25b6 the EPS and pretax income targets\nare aligned with annual financial plan\ntargets, which the Board and management have\nassessed for achievability; accordingly, the\ntargets provide incentives to take appropriate\namounts of risk to achieve those goals. In\naddition, both EPS and pretax income are used\nacross the organization for cash bonus payout\ncalculations, and the Committee believes that\nusing these measures in executive officer\nincentive award calculations supports\nalignment with their areas of responsibility.\n                                              \n    44      U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis Both the Corporate Result and\nBusiness Line Result are assessed relative to\ntargets included in our company\u2019s annual\nfinancial plan. The Board establishes these\nfinancial targets for each fiscal year with\nthe intent that they represent challenging,\nyet achievable, goals. Under the AEIP, the\nCommittee has the authority to adjust results\nto exclude the effect of certain events. The\nFinal Bonus Funding Percentage is calculated\nas follows: \u25b6 Corporate Result:The percentage\nby which corporate EPS differs from the EPS\ntarget is multiplied by a leverage factor to\nmagnify the positive or negative variation\nfrom the results, yielding the Corporate\nResult. A leverage factor of 2:1 is applied to\ncorporate achievement of EPS goals between 80%\nand 120% of target. For any amount by which\ncorporate achievement of EPS goals is less\nthan 80% or more than 120%, the leverage\nfactor is 1:1. \u2713 The target level of EPS set\nby the Committee for 2024 was $3.88. The\ntarget EPS level is intended to reflect the\ncore earnings of the company and, as such,\nexcluded the impact of notable items.\nAdditional information on the calculation of\nthe 2024 Corporate Result, based on adjusted\nEPS results, is described below. \u25b6 Business\nLine Result:A payout component is calculated\nfor each business line based on the percentage\nby which the business line\u2019s pretax income\nvaries from target, using the same leverage\nfactor as is applied to corporate performance.\nFor executives with leadership\nresponsibilities for the entire company,\nincluding Messrs. Cecere, Dolan, and Stern,\nthe Business Line Result is based on the\nweighted average of the pretax income results\nof all the company\u2019s business lines. For\nexecutives who lead a revenue-producing group,\nincluding Mr. Kotwal, the Business Line Result\nis based on the weighted average pretax income\nresults of the business lines within the group\nthat the executive leads. In connection with\nher promotion to the role of President during\n2024, Ms. Kedia\u2019s Business Line Result for\n2024 was determined based on a pro-rated\ncombination of (1) the weighted average of the\npretax income results of all the company\u2019s\nbusiness lines for the period Ms. Kedia held\nthe role of President and (2) the weighted\naverage pretax income results for the business\nlines within the Wealth, Corporate, Commercial\nand Institutional Banking group that she led\nuntil May 2024. Additional information on the\ncalculation of the 2024 Business Line Result,\nbased on adjusted pretax income results, for\neach NEO who is a current executive is\ndescribed below. \u25b6 Each of the Corporate\nResult and the Business Line Result is\nmultiplied by 50% and then added together to\narrive at the Formulaic Bonus Funding\nPercentagefor each NEO. \u25b6 The Committee\nperforms a Qualitative Reviewof the Formulaic\nBonus Funding Percentage, which includes a\nholistic assessment of performance on key\nstrategic priorities, as described below. The\nresults of the Committee\u2019s assessment of these\nadditional performance factors allows the\nCommittee to adjust the formulaic bonus\ncalculation by up to 25% (either positively or\nnegatively) to create greater alignment with\noverall organizational performance if\nappropriate.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy             45    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis 2024 Corporate Result: The Corporate\nResult was calculated as follows: \u25b6 The target\nlevel of EPS set by the Committee for 2024 was\n$3.88, as adjusted for notable items. \u25b6 The\ncompany reported EPS results of $3.79, which\nwas adjusted (1) upward by $0.19 for purposes\nof the Corporate Result to account for notable\nitems, including merger and integration\ncharges related to the MUFG Union Bank\nacquisition, FDIC special assessment charges\nand charges related to lease impairments and\noperational efficiency actions, and certain\nnotable items that the Committee deemed\nappropriate and (2) downward by $0.15 for loan\nloss reserve variation as described below. \u25b6\nThe resulting adjusted EPS value used to\ncalculate the Corporate Result was $3.83. \u25b6\nThe Corporate Result of 97.2% was the outcome\nafter applying the leverage factor to the\npercentage difference between target and\nadjusted EPS results. Funding and Payout of\nCorporate Result For purposes of computing the\nCorporate Result used in the Formulaic Bonus\nFunding Percentage, the Committee adjusts\nactual reported EPS to (i) remove the impact\nof any variation in our loan loss reserve\nbuild or release on an after-tax basis, while\nincluding net charge-offs to capture actual\ncredit losses experienced and (ii) normalize\nany notable items that impacted EPS during the\nperformance year. The Committee established\nits approach to adjusting for variation in our\nloan loss reserve in 2020 in connection with\nour adoption of the Current Expected Credit\nLosses (CECL) accounting standard in January\n2020. Our adoption of CECL creates the\npotential for significant accounting\nvolatility and uncertainty with respect to the\nloan loss reserve that is often dependent upon\na number of judgmental factors and economic\nassumptions. In an effort to measure\nperformance based on actual credit losses, the\ncompany excludes changes in the allowance\ndriven by these factors and includes net\ncharge-offs in the determination. For 2024,\nthis calculation resulted in a downward\nadjustment to our reported EPS of $0.15. It\nhas also been the Committee\u2019s practice to\nadjust for notable items that are unusual or\nrelated to acquisitions. In 2024, the EPS\nresult was adjusted upward by $0.19 to exclude\nthe impact of merger and integration charges\nrelated to the MUFG Union Bank acquisition,\nFDIC special assessment charges and charges\nrelated to lease impairments and operational\nefficiency actions. The Committee adjustments\nresulted in a total Corporate Result EPS of\n$3.83.\n                                              \n    46      U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\n2024 Business Line Results: The Business Line\nResult was calculated as follows: \u25b6 Pre-tax\nincome targets are established at the\nbeginning of the year for each of our\ncompany\u2019s more than 15 revenue-producing\nbusiness lines in support of our Corporate EPS\ntarget. \u25b6 For 2024, pretax income results,\ninclusive of the regular adjustments relating\nto loan loss reserves and CECL described above\nand adjustments for certain notable items,\nranged from 99.9% to 107.9% of target\nperformance across our company\u2019s more than 15\nrevenue-producing business lines. \u25b6 These\nresults generated Business Line Results of\n99.9% for Payment Services,105.3% for Consumer\nand Business Banking, and 107.9% for Wealth,\nCorporate, Commercial and Institutional\nBanking following application of the leverage\nfactor and the 0% floor and 200% ceiling. \u25b6\nThe weighted average Business Line Result of\nall business lines was 104%. For purposes of\ncomputing the Formulaic Bonus Funding\nPercentage for the Business Line Result,\npretax income includes a component for changes\nin the loan loss reserve driven by loan\nbalances and changes in loan portfolio credit\nquality. The Committee adjusts these results\nso that the effect of any variation in our\nloan loss reserve build or release driven by\nsuch changes in loan portfolio credit quality\nis reduced by 50%. The Committee believes that\nthis adjustment serves to align bonus funding\nwith changes in credit quality while reducing\nsome of the volatility caused by variable\njudgmental factors. The Committee applies\nthese adjustments for loan loss reserve\nvariation consistently, whether the ultimate\nimpact is positive or negative, and believes\nthat such adjustments maintain accountability\nfor credit quality.

For 2024, the\nqualitative review focused on the Committee\u2019s\nassessment of performance relative to key\nstrategic initiatives, including progress on\nkey growth initiatives, execution of the\ncompany\u2019s capital strategy, risk management,\norganizational efficiency programs (including\nexpense program and workforce and location\nstrategy), and corporate responsibility and\nsustainability initiatives. 2024 Qualitative\nReview actions: Based on its assessment of\ncorporate performance and the factors noted\nabove, the Committee determined that the\nformulaic outcomes appropriately recognized\nperformance for the company\u2019s executive\nofficers in 2024 and, therefore, did not to\nmake any qualitative adjustments to the\nformulaic bonus funding percentage outcome for\nsuch executives. Factoring in individual\nperformance and risk sensitivity The Committee\nconsiders the performance of the business\nlines managed by each executive officer and\nthat executive officer\u2019s individual\nperformance during the year. The Committee\nalso uses a formal \u201crisk scorecard\u201d assessment\nwhich, together with the individual\nperformance assessment, can result in downward\nor upward adjustments to each NEO\u2019s Bonus\nFunding Award Percentage to reflect that\nexecutive\u2019s demonstrated sensitivity to risk.\nThe Committee believes that it is important to\nretain the ability to recognize outstanding\nindividual performance and risk mitigation in\ndetermining Annual Cash Incentive Payouts, as\nwell as to acknowledge circumstances where\nindividual\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy             47    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis performance improvements are\nsuggested or where inappropriate risk-taking\nbehaviors have occurred. Modifications to our\nNEOs\u2019 Bonus Funding Award Percentage based on\ntheir individual performance and risk\nsensitivity have been used only occasionally,\nhowever, and have historically been modest in\nscope. 2024 individual performance and risk\nsensitivity actions: The Committee determined\nthat the applicable Final Bonus Funding\nPercentage for each current NEO appropriately\nreflected that executive\u2019s performance and\ncontributions to the company in 2024.\nAccordingly, no individual performance-based\nmodifications were made to the NEO\u2019s Bonus\nFunding Percentages. Following an analysis of\neach NEO\u2019s risk scorecard results, the\nCommittee did not make any risk-based\nmodifications to the NEOs\u2019 Final Bonus Funding\nPercentages. 2024 Annual Cash Incentive Payout\nresults: The resulting payouts made to the\nNEOs 1in March 2025 for 2024 performance under\nthe AEIP were as follows: 1. Timothy A. Welsh\nreceived a $1,350,000 payment equivalent to a\npro-rated amount calculated based on his\ntarget award level of $1,800,000 under the\nAEIP for the number of full months worked in\nthe period from January 1, 2024 through\nOctober 4, 2024, which was paid following his\nlast day of employment on October 4, 2024\npursuant to the company\u2019s broad-based U.S.\nBank Severance Pay Program (the Severance Pay\nProgram). See \u201cPotential payments upon\ntermination or change-in-control\u201d for\nadditional information. 2. Ms. Kedia\u2019s\nweighted 2024 Business Line Result is based on\na pro-rated combination of (1) the weighted\naverage pretax income results for all the\ncompany\u2019s business lines applicable for the\nperiod she held the role of President and (2)\nthe weighted average pretax income results for\nthe business lines within the Wealth,\nCorporate, Commercial and Institutional\nBanking group that she led until May 2024.\nLong-term incentive awards Establishing the\nstructure of the equity awards Long-term,\nequity-based compensation represents the most\nsignificant portion of our NEOs\u2019 total\ncompensation package. The Committee uses\nequity awards to align the NEOs\u2019 interests\nwith those of long-term shareholders. In 2024,\n64% of our CEO\u2019s target total direct\ncompensation and between 56% and 67% of our\nother NEOs\u2019 target total direct compensation\nconsisted of equity awards. Following its\napproval by shareholders at our 2024 annual\nmeeting held on April 16, 2024, the Committee\ngrants equity awards to executive officers\nunder the U.S. Bancorp 2024 Stock Incentive\nPlan. Prior to that, equity awards to our\nexecutive officers were granted under the U.S.\nBancorp 2015 Stock Incentive Plan. In 2024,\n60% of the value of each executive officer\u2019s\nlong-term incentive award was granted in the\nform of PRSUs that will cliff vest (if earned)\non the third anniversary of the grant date,\nfollowing a three-year performance period, and\n40% was granted in the form of RSUs that vest\nratably over three years from the date of\ngrant. Cash dividends on unvested PRSUs accrue\nduring the performance period but are only\npaid at vesting on shares earned, if any, by\nthe executives. The mix of performance-based\nand time-based equity awards, with the mix\nmore heavily weighted toward performance-based\nequity, is designed to motivate achievement of\nfinancial objectives while encouraging\nretention and stock ownership.\n                                              \n    48      U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nSetting the value of the equity awards Each\nyear in January, the Committee determines the\ndollar value of the long-term incentive awards\nto be granted to the executive officers, with\nthe grants being made on a pre-determined date\nin February or March. In setting each year\u2019s\naward amounts, the Committee considers the\nrelative market position of the awards and the\ntotal compensation for each executive, the\nproportion of each executive\u2019s total direct\ncompensation to be delivered as a long-term\nincentive award, internal pay equity,\nexecutive performance and changes in\nresponsibility, retention, and corporate\nperformance. 2024 equity value actions: In\nJanuary 2024, the Committee increased the\nvalue of the long-term incentive awards\ngranted to the NEOs in 2024 to align the NEOs\u2019\ntotal compensation more closely with the\nopportunities available to executives in\nsimilar roles at companies in our peer group\nrelative to our size and, for Mr. Dolan,\nchanges in the scope of his leadership role in\nthe organization during 2024. On May 3, 2024,\nthe Committee awarded Ms. Kedia an additional\nlong-term incentive award in connection with\nher promotion to the role of President, valued\nat $1,500,000 as of the grant date of May 6,\n2024, which was granted 60% in the form of\nPRSUs and 40% in the form of RSUs under the\n2024 Stock Incentive Plan.\n                                              \n               Va\u2026               V\u2026           \n               of\u2026               o\u2026           \n               aw\u2026               a\u2026           \n               in                in           \n    NEO        20\u2026               2\u2026           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n    An\u2026        $    10\u2026          $   11\u2026      \n    Ce\u2026                                       \n    Jo\u2026                                       \n    C.         $    60\u2026          $   2,\u2026      \n    St\u2026                                       \n    Gu\u2026        $    3,\u2026          $   6,\u2026      \n    Ke\u2026                                       \n    Te\u2026                                       \n    R.         $    4,\u2026          $   5,\u2026      \n    Do\u2026                                       \n    Sh\u2026                                       \n    M.         $    3,\u2026          $   4,\u2026      \n    Ko\u2026                                       \n    Ti\u2026                                       \n    A.         $    3,\u2026          $   5,\u2026      \n    We\u2026                                       \n                                              \n1.

As previously disclosed by the company\non a Form 8-K filed on August 23, 2023, the\nCommittee determined that Mr. Stern would be\neligible to receive a long-term equity award\nconsistent with the structure and terms of\nother executive officers in 2024. 2. Includes\nthe additional long-term incentive award\ngranted to Ms. Kedia on May 6, 2024 in\nconnection with her promotion to the role of\nPresident. 3. Only a portion of the equity\nawards granted to Mr. Welsh in February 2024\nwith vest dates in 2025 and 2026 continue to\nvest on the same schedule following his last\nday of employment on October 4, 2024. The\nremaining portion of such awards were\ncancelled in accordance with the terms of the\napplicable award agreements. 2025 long-term\nincentive actions: In addition, as previously\ndisclosed by the company on a Form 8-K filed\non January 28, 2025, in connection with her\nelection to the role of President and Chief\nExecutive Officer effective April 15, 2025,\nthe Committee determined that Ms. Kedia would\nreceive an annual long-term equity award for\n2025, valued at $10 million as of the grant\ndate of February 27, 2025, consistent with the\nstructure and terms of other executive\nofficers in 2025. The award is part of Ms.\nKedia\u2019s total direct compensation for 2025,\nincluding her time serving as CEO, is tied to\nthe company\u2019s achievement of financial\nperformance metrics over a three-year\nperformance period (2025-2027), and does not\ncontain any special one-time components. The\nbase salary and target annual cash incentive\naward that Ms. Kedia will receive as Chief\nExecutive Officer have not been determined at\nthis time. In accordance with the structure of\nall long-term incentive awards granted on that\ndate, 60% of the award\u2019s value was granted in\nthe form of PRSUs and 40% in the form of RSUs.\nThe PRSUs granted to Ms. Kedia will be earned\nbased on the company\u2019s achievement of absolute\nand relative ROTCE targets over a three-year\nperformance period and a TSR modifier based on\nthe Company\u2019s cumulative three-year TSR\nperformance relative to its financial peer\ngroup in alignment with the long-term\ninterests of our shareholders.

In\ndetermining the value of Ms. Kedia\u2019s 2025\nlong-term incentive award, the Committee\nconsidered, among other factors, the announced\ntransition to the CEO role in 2025 and market\npay levels.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy             49    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis Selecting the performance metrics for\nthe 2024 PRSU awards As part of its 2024 PRSU\ndesign review, the Committee determined that\nit was appropriate for the number of PRSUs\nearned at the end of the three-year\nperformance period to continue to be\ndetermined by a formula that uses a comparison\nof our actual ROE result to target-level ROE,\nas well as our ROE performance relative to our\npeer financial institutions. ROE is used as\nthe performance metric because: \u25b6 it directly\nreflects the return generated by the company\non our shareholders\u2019 investment; \u25b6 it\nencompasses profitability, efficiency, balance\nsheet management and financial leverage, and\nis among the most widely used indicators of\nfinancial performance in our industry; \u25b6\nachieving a high ROE requires an appropriate\nbalance between achieving the highest return\non invested capital and managing risk within\nthe company\u2019s established risk tolerance\nlevels; and \u25b6 using ROE as a performance\nmetric aligns the interests of the executives\nwith those of long-term shareholders because\nsustaining a high ROE is a primary driver of\nstrong earnings growth and long-term\nvaluation. Consistent with prior years, the\nCommittee uses a performance matrix,\nillustrated below, that reflects both absolute\nand relative ROE scales to determine the final\nPRSU award amounts earned during the\nperformance period. Target levels of both\nabsolute and relative ROE are established,\nwith maximum and minimum levels also\nidentified. Earned amounts are determined\nusing straight-line interpolation. The\nCommittee believes that the PRSU earn-out\nstructure provides an important balance\nbetween rewarding the achievement of absolute\nperformance goals and strong relative\nperformance. Executives are not rewarded for\npoor performance simply because members of our\nfinancial peer group have even worse\nperformance, nor are they rewarded for\nexceeding expectations if performance relative\nto peers is substandard. In addition, by using\na sliding scale for each ROE performance\nmetric, the matrix takes into account the\namount of variance from the ROE target and\npeer group ROE results, rewarding performance\nwhile mitigating the incentive for excessive\nrisk taking that may result from an \u201call-or-\nnothing\u201d award. Setting the levels of absolute\nand relative ROE for the 2024 PRSU performance\nmatrix The target and maximum ROE levels\nselected by the Committee for the three-year\nperformance period are based on the ROE range\nincluded in the company\u2019s profitability goals\npublicly communicated prior to the grant date.\nThe company\u2019s ROE result may be adjusted from\nreported results to normalize the effect of\nsignificant notable items such as merger-\nrelated charges in the event of an\nacquisition. Since 2020, ROE results include\nadjustments related to the impact of the CECL\naccounting standard. The adjustments eliminate\nthe volatility of the accounting standard\nrelated to changes in the allowance for credit\nlosses, while including net charge-offs\nrelated to actual credit losses experienced.\nThese CECL-related adjustments to the ROE\ncalculation for the PRSU awards were adopted\nby the Committee in January 2020, when we\nadopted the accounting standard. The Committee\nalso establishes a sliding scale of ROE\nachieved relative to the ROE of our financial\npeer group, which consists of the following\ninstitutions: Bank of America Corporation,\nCitizens Financial Group, Fifth Third Bancorp,\nJPMorgan Chase & Co., KeyCorp, The PNC\nFinancial Service Group, Inc., Regions\nFinancial Corporation, Truist Financial\nCorporation and Wells Fargo & Company. This\ngroup is used by the company for financial\ncomparison purposes because these companies,\nalong with U.S. Bancorp, are the largest\nfinancial services companies based in the\nUnited States that provide broadly comparable\nretail and commercial banking services. The\nROE performance matrix provides that\nperformance above the median of peers will\nincrease the payout otherwise earned based on\nour absolute ROE result, while performance\nbelow the median of peers will reduce the\naward payout. The company\u2019s absolute and\nrelative ROE results for each of the three\nyears within the performance period are\napplied to the performance matrix to produce a\npercentage of target PRSUs results for that\nyear. At the end of the performance period,\nthe percentage results for the three years\nwill be averaged to determine the percentage\nof target PRSUs earned and eligible to vest\nupon the third anniversary of the grant date.\n                                              \n    50      U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nResults of PRSUs earned 2022-2024: In March\n2022, PRSUs were granted for the 2022-2024\nperformance period using the following ROE\nperformance matrix:\n                                              \n                                              \n                        \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                   \u200b     \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                   \u200b     \u200b       \u2026              \n                   \u2026    \u200b       \u200b               \n                   \u2026    \u200b       \u200b               \n                   \u2026    \u200b       \u200b               \n                   \u200b     \u200b       \u2026              \n                               \u2026              \n                        \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                   \u200b     \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                                              \nThe absolute and relative ROE performance\nduring the three-year period was as follows:\n                                              \n                            P\u2026        E\u2026      \n      Y\u2026  \u200b        R\u2026        g\u2026        o\u2026      \n                            r\u2026        p\u2026      \n                            At                \n      2\u2026  \u200b        1\u2026        or        1\u2026      \n                            a\u2026                \n                            7\u2026                \n                            At                \n      2\u2026  \u200b        1\u2026        or        1\u2026      \n                            a\u2026                \n                            7\u2026                \n                            At                \n      2\u2026  \u200b        1\u2026        or        1\u2026      \n                            a\u2026                \n                            7\u2026                \n          F\u2026                                  \n          e\u2026                                  \n          p\u2026                                  \n          f\u2026                                  \n          P\u2026                          1\u2026      \n          a\u2026                                  \n          g\u2026                                  \n          in                                  \n          2\u2026                                  \n                                              \n1.

In addition, the Committee\nadded a relative TSR modifier for purposes of\ndetermining the number of PRSUs earned at the\nend of the three-year performance period to\nfurther enhance alignment with shareholder\noutcomes. Selecting the performance metrics\nfor the 2025 PRSU awards The Committee\ndetermined that ROTCE was an appropriate\nperformance metric for the 2025 PRSU awards\nbecause it is a key long-term performance\npriority under the company\u2019s strategic plan,\nreflects the profits generated by the company\non our shareholders\u2019 investment, and is a\nuseful metric for comparing the profitability\nof the company and our peers. ROTCE measures\nthe company\u2019s net income applicable to common\nequity, excluding, on a tax-adjusted basis,\nthe impact of impairment and amortization of\nintangible assets, as a percentage of average\ntangible common equity. The Committee believes\nit is appropriate for use in our long-term\nincentive program due to the strong\ncorrelation between ROTCE and the delivery of\npositive share price performance to\nshareholders. Tangible common equity is a non-\nGAAP financial measure and represents total\nequity less preferred equity, non-controlling\ninterests, goodwill and certain identifiable\nintangible assets. For purposes of measuring\nperformance, as provided in our 2024 Stock\nIncentive Plan or the applicable form of award\nagreement, ROTCE may be further adjusted by\nthe Committee, in its discretion, to normalize\nthe effect of significant notable items such\nas discontinued operations, changes in\napplicable accounting rules or principles,\nacquisitions, mergers or restructuring costs,\nand other extraordinary or unusual items or\nevents. ROTCE results also include adjustments\nrelated to the impact of the CECL accounting\nstandard. Cumulative three-year TSR\nperformance relative to peers was added as a\nmodifier because it directly reflects the\nrelative performance of our common stock\nversus our financial peer group over the\nthree-year performance period and further\naligns the interests of our executives with\nthe long-term interests of our shareholders.\nThe Committee may adjust TSR for stock splits,\nreverse stock splits, stock dividends, and\nother unusual, extraordinary or non-recurring\ntransactions or events, or other similar\nchanges in the capital structure of the\ncompany, as applicable. Setting the levels of\nabsolute and relative ROTCE for the 2025 PRSU\nperformance matrix The target ROTCE level\nselected by the Committee for the three-year\nperformance period is based on the ROTCE\ntarget guidance publicly communicated by the\ncompany at its 2024 Investor Day. The\nCommittee also established a sliding scale of\nROTCE achieved relative to the ROTCE of our\nfinancial peer group. In connection with its\ndetermination to change the performance\nmetrics for the 2025 PRSU design, the\nCommittee evaluated the financial peer group\nused for the 2024 PRSU awards and determined\nthat it continued to be appropriate. The\nCommittee believes that the 2025 PRSU earn-out\nstructure continues to provide an important\nbalance between rewarding the achievement of\nabsolute performance goals and strong relative\nperformance and sets maximum, target and\nminimum performance thresholds relative to our\nfinancial peer group that are sufficiently\nrigorous compared to the company\u2019s ROTCE\noutlook over the next three years, and taking\ninto account differences in our diversified\nbusiness mix relative to peers. The ROTCE\nperformance matrix provides that performance\nabove the median of peers will increase the\npayout otherwise earned based on our absolute\nROTCE result, while performance below the\nmedian of peers will reduce the award payout.\nThe company\u2019s absolute and relative ROTCE\nresults for each of the three years within the\nperformance period will be applied to the\nperformance matrix to produce a percentage of\ntarget PRSUs results for that year using\nstraight-line interpolation. At the end of the\nperformance period, the percentage results for\nthe three years will be averaged to determine\nthe percentage of target PRSUs, with that\npercentage adjusted up or down 15% by\napplication of TSR Modifier Factor which is\ndetermined based on the company\u2019s peer group\nTSR ranking for the performance period. The\nfinal number of PRSUs earned and eligible to\nvest upon the third anniversary of the grant\ndate will be determined by multiplying the\npercentage of target PRSUs by the TSR Modifier\nFactor, and then multiplying the result by the\ntarget PRSU award number.\n                                              \n    52      U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nFor 2025 awards, the Committee approved PRSU\nawards with the following ROTCE performance\nmatrix and relative TSR modifier calculated\nbased on the trailing 20-trading day average\nclosing price for our common stock and the\nfinancial peer group over the performance\nperiod:\n                                              \n                                              \n                        \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                   \u200b     \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                   \u200b     \u200b       \u2026              \n                   \u2026    \u200b       \u200b               \n                   \u2026    \u200b       \u200b               \n                   \u2026    \u200b       \u200b               \n                   \u200b     \u200b       \u2026              \n                               \u2026              \n                        \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                   \u200b     \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                                              \n                                              \n                 TSR                          \n                 Modifier                     \n      Peer                           TSR      \n      Group TSR  \u200b               Modifier      \n      Ranking                     Factor      \n      Greater                                 \n      than       \u200b                   1.15      \n      75thperc\u2026                               \n      At or                                   \n      between    \u200b                     No      \n      25thand                  adjustme\u2026      \n      75thperc\u2026                               \n      Less than  \u200b                   0.85      \n      25thperc\u2026                               \n                                              \nDecision making and policies Who is involved\nin making executive compensation decisions\nExecutive compensation policy, practices, and\namounts are determined by the Committee, which\nis composed entirely of independent directors.\nThe Committee has responsibility for setting\neach component of compensation for our CEO\nwith the assistance and guidance of its\nindependent compensation consultant, Meridian\nCompensation Partners, LLC (Meridian).

The\nCommittee used the following group of\nfinancial services companies to perform market\nassessments when setting the compensation of\nour executive officers in 2024 (listed in\ndescending order of assets as of December 31,\n2024):\n                                              \n                        \u2026                     \n           \u2026            \u2026            \u2026        \n           \u2026            \u2026            \u2026        \n           \u2026            \u2026            \u2026        \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n           $            $            $        \n           $            $            $        \n           $            $            $        \n           $            $            $        \n           $            $            $        \n           $            $            $        \n           $            $            $        \n           $            $            $        \n           $            $            $        \n           $            $            $        \n           \u200b             \u200b             \u200b         \n                                              \n1.

Source: S&P Capital IQ based on company\nfilings and market data; for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024; excludes taxable-equivalent\nadjustments There were no changes to the 2023\npeer group; accordingly, the 2024 peer group\nconsisted of the same peer companies. The\nCommittee selects compensation peer group\ncompanies that it believes represent our most\nmeaningful competitors in the marketplace for\nexecutive talent. The Committee also reviews\nand uses compensation data from a large group\nof diversified financial services companies as\nan additional point of comparison. As a result\nof this ongoing analysis and resulting\ncompensation adjustments, our executive\ncompensation positioning is generally within\nmarket range, recognizing that several\npositions are unique to our company and do not\nhave clear market comparisons. Stock ownership\nand retention requirements The Committee\nbelieves that ownership of our common stock by\nour executive officers directly aligns their\ninterests with those of our other shareholders\nand helps balance the incentives for risk\ntaking inherent in equity-based awards. We\nrequire our executives to hold significant\namounts of company stock. We also require that\nthey retain a substantial portion of their\nvested stock awards (net of shares withheld to\nsatisfy tax obligations) until retirement,\neven after minimum ownership levels have been\nmet. The current ownership and retention\nrequirements are as follows:\n                                              \n                  Retention                   \n                  requirement                 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                      A\u2026      \n                           Un\u2026        m\u2026      \n                 M\u2026        mi\u2026        l\u2026      \n      Ex\u2026        o\u2026        le\u2026        is      \n      Of\u2026        l\u2026        is         m\u2026      \n                           met        a\u2026      \n                                      u\u2026      \n                                      r\u2026      \n                 6x        75%        5\u2026      \n      CEO        b\u2026        of         of      \n                 s\u2026        net        n\u2026      \n                           sh\u2026        s\u2026      \n      Ot\u2026        3x        75%        2\u2026      \n      ex\u2026        b\u2026        of         of      \n      of\u2026        s\u2026        net        n\u2026      \n                           sh\u2026        s\u2026      \n                                              \nVested PRSUs, all RSUs, and stock received and\nheld after exercise of stock options are\nincluded in determining whether an executive\nofficer satisfies his or her ownership\nrequirements.

The recovery\npolicy applies to the company\u2019s executive\nofficers and requires recovery of incentive-\nbased compensation erroneously received by\nexecutive officers after an accounting\nrestatement as required under those rules.\nThis policy is in addition to, and does not\nreplace, the existing policy. Change-in-\ncontrol provisions for executive officers \u25b6 No\nsingle-trigger cash benefit:The executive\nofficers are not entitled to receive any cash\npayments upon a change-in-control of our\ncompany, with or without a subsequent\ntermination in employment, except as provided\nby broad-based severance plans generally\navailable to our employees. Additional\ninformation on the severance plan benefits for\nour NEOs is included under \u201cPotential payments\nupon termination or change-in-control\u201d below.\nNone of our NEOs have employment or standalone\nchange-in-control agreements. \u25b6 No single-\ntrigger equity acceleration:The equity award\nagreements for executive officers provide that\na change-in-control of our company would not\ntrigger accelerated vesting of an executive\nofficer\u2019s outstanding equity awards unless his\nor her termination of employment is a\nqualifying termination (as defined in the\nequity award agreements) within 12 months\nafter the change-in-control other than for\ncause. Hedging and pledging policy The\ncompany\u2019s Insider Trading Policy prohibits\nexecutive officers and directors of the\ncompany from hedging shares of the company\u2019s\ncommon stock, including, but not limited to,\nusing short sales, puts, calls, prepaid\nvariable forwards, equity swaps, collars and\nexchange funds. The policy also prohibits\nexecutive officers and directors from pledging\nshares of the company\u2019s common stock as\ncollateral for a loan or holding the company\u2019s\ncommon stock in a margin account. Equity grant\npolicies and practices The company currently\ndoes not, and during 2024 did not, grant stock\noptions, stock appreciation rights, or similar\noption-like instruments under either the prior\n2015 Stock Incentive Plan or the 2024 Stock\nIncentive Plan and has no policies or\npractices to disclose pursuant to Item 402(x)\nof SEC Regulation S-K. In addition, the\ncompany does not schedule equity award grants\nin anticipation of the release of material,\nnon-public information, nor does the company\ntime the release of material non-public\ninformation based on equity grant dates.\nHealth and other benefits Our NEOs are\neligible to receive health benefits under the\nsame plans and on the same terms available to\nour other employees, matching contributions to\ntheir U.S. Bank 401(k) Savings Plan accounts\non the same basis as our other employees, and\nretirement benefits that are earned over their\ncareer with the company. Our NEOs and certain\nother employees are eligible to participate in\nour Deferred Compensation Plan and pension\nprogram. We provide additional information on\nthese plans in the \u201cExecutive compensation\u201d\nsection below. In addition, the principal\nperquisites we may provide to our executive\nofficers include reasonable home security\nsystem services, parking and financial\nplanning expense reimbursement, business club\ndues, and limited personal use of corporate\naircraft and corporate housing for out-of-\nstate commuting purposes. NEOs do not receive\ngross-up payments for tax liabilities\nresulting from perquisites, except in relation\nto certain relocation expenses.\n                                              \n    56      U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis Risk considerations Overview: Prudent\nrisk taking is an integral part of any\nbusiness strategy, and our compensation\nprogram is not intended to encourage\nmanagement decisions that completely eliminate\nrisk. Rather, the combination of various\nelements in our program is designed to\nencourage appropriate sensitivity to risk and\nmitigate the potential to reward risk taking\nthat may produce short-term results that\nappear in isolation to be favorable, but that\nmay undermine the successful execution of our\nlong-term business strategy and negatively\naffect shareholder value. Our compensation\npractices are also designed to reward\nperformance while maintaining our core\ncommitment to customer service and ethical\nprinciples. Together with the company\u2019s\nprocesses for strategic planning, its internal\ncontrol over financial reporting and other\nfinancial and compliance policies and\npractices, the design of our compensation\nprogram helps to discourage management actions\nthat demonstrate insensitivity to risk. Role\nof management:As a large financial services\ncompany, we are subject to ongoing regulatory\nreviews of incentive compensation policies and\npractices. We routinely undertake a thorough\nrisk analysis of every incentive compensation\nplan of the company, the individuals covered\nby each plan and the risks inherent in each\nplan\u2019s design and implementation. We also\nconduct validation and back-testing activities\nto ensure that our compensation plans are\ncorrectly risk rated, that they are designed\nto adequately mitigate inherent risk, and that\neach plan is administered effectively. The\nIncentive Review Committee was created to\noversee that review and to provide more\ncomprehensive oversight of the relationship\nbetween the various kinds of risk we manage\nand our company\u2019s incentive compensation plans\nand programs. The Incentive Review Committee\nmeets throughout the year and reviews and\napproves all company incentive plans. The\nIncentive Review Committee reviews incentive\nplan elements such as risk controls, plan\nparticipants, performance measures,\nperformance and payout curves or formulas, how\ntarget level performance is determined\n(including whether any thresholds and caps\nexist), how frequently payouts occur, and the\nmix of fixed and variable compensation that\nthe plan delivers. The plans and programs are\nalso reviewed from the standpoint of\nreasonableness (for example, how target pay\nlevels compare to similar plans for similar\nemployee groups at other companies, and how\npayout amounts relate to the results that\ngenerate the payments), how well the plans and\nprograms are aligned with the company\u2019s goals\nand objectives and with its risk appetite, and\nfrom an overall standpoint, whether these\nplans and programs represent an appropriate\nmix of short-term and long-term compensation.\nAs part of this review by the Incentive Review\nCommittee, our management team, including\nsenior risk officers and individuals from the\ncompensation department, have identified the\nrisks inherent in these programs and have\nmodified plans and controls where appropriate\nto mitigate certain potential risks. For\nexample, most business line incentive\ncompensation plans with a credit component\ntrack early defaults, or defaults that occur\nwithin the first 12 months, and must include a\nprovision that allows the company to offset\nfuture payments by the amount of the\npreviously paid incentives related to the\nearly default. In addition, a \u201crisk scorecard\u201d\nassessment measuring adequacy of risk\nmanagement is undertaken for senior\nmanagement-level employees who have the\nindividual ability to pose material risk to\nthe company, including the executive officers;\nall employees who have credit responsibility\nand who participate in annual corporate cash\nincentive plans; and all employees who, as\npart of a group, can engage in risk-taking\nbehavior that could be material to the company\nand who participate in annual corporate cash\nincentive plans. This analysis serves as the\nbasis for annual cash incentive plan\nadjustments for these employees. Annually, the\nIncentive Review Committee also addresses risk\nevents that pose a material adverse impact to\nthe company or business line to determine\nwhether an event should trigger cancellation\nof equity awards. The Incentive Review\nCommittee has reviewed its process with the\nCommittee and discussed the areas where\ncompensation-related risks were being\naddressed by plan modifications, or were\nmitigated by internal controls or otherwise.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy             57    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nRole of the Board:The Committee also conducts\nan annual review of the compensation packages\nand components for the executive officers. The\nCommittee assesses the incentives for risk\ntaking contained in the compensation program\nand balances them with the other goals of the\ncompensation program. In evaluating the\nincentives for risk taking in compensation\nplans and policies for executive officers, the\nCommittee considered the following risk-\nmitigating aspects of those plans and\npolicies:\n                                              \n      Overall executive compensation          \n      program risk mitigation factors         \n      \u25b6                                       \n      Long-term incentive focus:The           \n      majority of the total compensation      \n      received by executive officers is       \n      in the form of equity awards with       \n      multi-year vesting schedules,           \n      which helps to ensure that              \n      executives have significant value       \n      tied to long-term stock price           \n      performance and mitigates               \n      incentives to manage the company        \n      with an excessive focus on              \n      short-term gain.                        \n      \u200b                                        \n      \u25b6                                       \n      Meaningful stock ownership and          \n      retention requirements:Executives       \n      are required to hold significant        \n      amounts of company stock, a             \n      portion of which must be held           \n      until retirement, which we believe      \n      fosters the alignment of                \n      executives\u2019 interests with those        \n      of our long-term shareholders.          \n      \u200b                                        \n      \u25b6                                       \n      Policy prohibiting hedging of           \n      shares:Our executives are               \n      prohibited from taking actions          \n      designed to hedge or offset any         \n      decrease in the market value of         \n      our common stock.                       \n      \u200b                                        \n      Annual cash incentive risk              \n      mitigation factors                      \n      \u25b6                                       \n      Specific risk sensitivity               \n      analysis:The Committee considers        \n      corporate risk management               \n      performance in determining the          \n      bonus funding\u00a0percentage.

Name and principal position\nMs. Kedia has served as our President since\nMay 3, 2024. Prior to that she served as Vice\nChair, Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and\nInstitutional Banking. Mr. Kotwal served as\nVice Chair, Payment Services until February 2,\n2025; following that date he serves in an\nadvisory role supporting the leadership\ntransition of the Payments business through\nJune 30, 2025. Mr. Welsh served in his role as\nVice Chair, Consumer and Business Banking,\nuntil July 31, 2024; he remained employed by\nthe company and served as an advisor to the\nPresident through October 4, 2024. The amounts\nreported here for 2024 reflect compensation\npaid or awarded for the entire year for each\nof these NEOs. 2. Stock awards\nThe amounts in this column are calculated\nbased on the number of time-based restricted\nstock units, or RSUs, and performance-based\nrestricted stock units, or PRSUs, awarded and\nthe fair market value of U.S. Bancorp common\nstock on the date the award was made in\naccordance with Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification\n(ASC) Topic 718. See Note 17 to our\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nassumptions used to calculate our stock\nawards. The 2024 values in this table reflect\nthe fair market value of each officer\u2019s RSUs\nplus the target payout for the PRSUs on the\ngrant date. The number of PRSUs subject to\neach of these awards will be determined after\na three-year performance period beginning on\nJanuary 1, 2024, and ending December 31, 2026.\nDepending on our company performance during\nthe performance period, 0% to 150% of the\ntarget number of PRSUs granted to the NEOs\nwill be earned. The fair market value of RSUs\nplus the maximum potential payout amounts for\nthe PRSUs on the grant date(s) for 2024 were\nas follows: (i) Mr. Cecere, $14,300,031; (ii)\nMr. Stern, $3,509,996; (iii) Ms. Kedia,\n$8,450,006; (iv) Mr. Dolan, $6,500,002; (v)\nMr. Kotwal, $5,720,008; and (vi) Mr. Welsh,\n$6,500,002.\n                                              \n    60      U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\n\n3. Non-equity incentive plan compensation\nThe 2024 amounts in this column represent the\nAnnual Executive Incentive Plan, or AEIP,\nawards. For current executives, such amounts\nwere determined in January 2025 based on 2024\nperformance and paid out in February 2025. The\nAEIP and these awards are discussed above in\nthe \u201cCompensation discussion and analysis \u2014\nAnnual cash incentive awards\u201d section of this\nproxy statement. 4. Change in pension value\nand non-qualified deferred compensation\nearnings\nThe amounts in this column represent the\nincrease in the actuarial net present value of\nall future retirement benefits under the U.S.\nBank Pension Plan (the Pension Plan) and the\nU.S. Bank Non-Qualified Retirement Plan (the\nNon-Qualified Plan) from December 31, 2023 to\nDecember 31, 2024. A number of factors can\ncause the amounts reflected in this column to\nvary significantly, including volatility in\nthe discount rate applied to determine the\nvalue of future payment streams and changes to\nmortality assumptions. The change in present\nvalue amounts reported for 2024 are smaller\nthan those reported for 2023 for certain NEOs.\nThese smaller increases in value are due to\nthe increase in discount rates in 2024; year-\nend 2024 rates were roughly 65 basis points\nhigher than for year-end 2023, compared with a\nroughly 45 basis point decrease from the prior\nyear (which significantly increased the 2023\nvalues). Other factors contributing to the\nchange amounts are increases in pay, age and\nservice. The net present values of the pension\nbenefits as of December 31, 2024, used to\ncalculate the net change in pension benefits\nwere determined using the same assumptions\nused to determine our pension obligations and\nexpense for financial statement purposes. See\nNote 16 to our consolidated financial\nstatements included in our 2024 Annual Report\non Form 10-K for these specific assumptions.\nAdditional information about our Pension Plan\nand Non-Qualified Plan is included below under\nthe heading \u201cPension benefits.\u201d We have not\nprovided above-market or preferential earnings\non any nonqualified deferred compensation and,\naccordingly, no such amounts are reflected in\nthis column. 5.

The amounts for Ms. Kedia and Mr. Kotwal\nrepresent expenses related to corporate\nhousing in Minnesota, air travel expenses\nrelated to use of aircraft fractionally-owned\nby the company or commercial flights, and\nrelated parking and ground transportation when\ncommuting between their out-of-state\nresidences and our corporate headquarters in\nMinnesota. b. The amount for Mr. Cecere\nrepresents the incremental cost for personal\nuse of company-owned aircraft for two trips\ntaken by Mr. Cecere and his spouse. The amount\nfor Mr. Stern represents two nominal non-cash\ngifts. The amount for Ms. Kedia represents (i)\na $1,000 matching contribution under our\ncharitable matching gift program, which is\navailable to all our employees, (ii) a $1,885\ncost for personal expenses incurred in\nconnection with the attendance of her spouse\nat a required client event where the presence\nof spouses was expected, and (iii) a $150 non-\ncash gift. The amount for Mr. Kotwal\nrepresents a matching contribution under our\ncharitable matching gifts program, which is\navailable to all our employees. The amount for\nMr. Welsh represents payments made in\nconnection with his termination, including (i)\na $400,000 payment equivalent to six months of\nbase salary under the company\u2019s broad-based\nU.S. Bank Severance Pay Program (the Severance\nPay Program), (ii) a $1,350,000 payment\nequivalent to a pro-rated amount calculated\nbased on his annual incentive target award\nlevel of $1,800,000 under the AEIP for the\nnumber of full months worked in the period\nfrom January 1, 2024 through October 4, 2024,\npaid following his last day of employment on\nOctober 4, 2024 under the Severance Pay\nProgram, (iii) a $46,816 payment for unused\nvacation, payable on his termination and (iv)\na $487 non-cash gift. See \u201cPotential payments\nupon termination or change-in-control\u201d for\nadditional information on the payments under\nour Severance Pay Program. The aggregate\nincremental cost for corporate-owned aircraft\nis determined by multiplying the total number\nof personal flight hours by the direct\nvariable operating costs of the aircraft per\nhour including costs related to fuel, landing\nand parking fees, and crew expenses. For\nfractionally-owned aircraft, including amounts\nreferenced in footnote (a) above, the\nincremental cost is determined by multiplying\nthe total number of personal flight hours by\nthe contracted hourly and fuel charges. As the\naircraft are used primarily for business\ntravel, we do not include fixed costs that do\nnot change based on usage, such as crew\nsalaries, aircraft acquisition costs and\nmonthly management fees for fractionally-owned\naircraft.

The measurement date and material actuarial\nassumptions applied in quantifying the present\nvalue of the current accrued benefits are\ndiscussed in Note 16 to our consolidated\nfinancial statements included in our 2024\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. These assumptions\ninclude the use of a 5.70% discount rate for\nthe supplemental and excess plans and a 5.84%\ndiscount rate for the qualified pension plan.\nThe mortality assumptions used are based on\nthe white collar PRI-2012 mortality table\nprojected generationally using the MP-2021\nimprovement scale. The average pay used for\nthe benefit calculations was historical pay\nthrough the measurement date (December 31,\n2024). The amounts in this column, other than\nMr. Welsh\u2019s Excess Benefit, were calculated\nbased on the earliest age at which the\napplicable NEO is entitled to receive\nunreduced retirement benefits and ignore any\nvesting requirements. The earliest age of\nunreduced retirement benefits is 65 for all\nour NEOs. As Mr. Welsh ceased active\nemployment in 2024, under the terms of the\nplan, his Excess Benefit was calculated based\non an unreduced benefit at age 62. All of our\nNEOs are currently vested in 100% of their\npension benefits. 2. In the event of the death\nof one of the NEOs in this table, a pre-\nestablished percentage of the NEO\u2019s pension\nbenefits will be paid to the NEO\u2019s\nbeneficiary. The actual percentage paid to the\nbeneficiary is dependent on the form of\npayment of benefits elected by the NEO. The\ndefault percentage is 50% to the NEO\u2019s spouse.\nAn additional lump sum death benefit may be\npayable based on certain actuarial\ncalculations. The benefit amounts shown in\nthis column assume that each NEO will reach\nhis or her retirement age. Due to the level of\ndiscount rates (or any accelerated service),\nthe present value of death benefits commencing\nimmediately would exceed the total present\nvalue of accumulated benefits shown in this\ncolumn by the following amounts: (i) Mr.\nCecere, $1,276,201; (ii) Mr. Stern, $162,980;\n(iii) Ms. Kedia, $201,438; (iv) Mr. Dolan,\n$86,204; (v) Mr. Kotwal, $63,801; and (vi) Mr.\nWelsh, $31,296. 3. Mr. Cecere is 100% vested\nand eligible to begin receiving his benefits\nupon retirement. If any of the vested benefits\nare paid before Mr. Cecere reaches age 65, the\nbenefits are reduced by certain early\nretirement benefit formulas specified in the\napplicable plan for each year prior to Mr.\nCecere\u2019s reaching age 65. These early\nretirement benefit formulas reduce the annual\npension benefit amount payable to Mr. Cecere\ndue to the longer benefit payment period\nrelated to the earlier commencement of\nbenefits. Per the standard provisions of the\nsupplemental plan, upon his attainment of age\n60, Mr. Cecere became eligible for five\naccelerated years of service credit for\nservice to age 65. Mr. Cecere is currently\neligible for one accelerated year of service\ncredit, worth approximately $1.3 million; this\nvalue will gradually be reflected in the table\nabove and will have no extra value if he works\nto age 65. There is no effect on the\napplicable early reductions or benefit timing\nnoted above.\n                                              \n    66      U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\nUnderstanding our \u201cPension benefits\u201d table\nThis section provides information regarding\nthe company\u2019s retirement programs in which our\nNEOs participate, which include the U.S. Bank\nPension Plan and the U.S. Bank Non-Qualified\nRetirement Plan. Our company sponsors the U.S.\nBank Pension Plan (the Pension Plan) which was\ncreated through the merger of the former U.S.\nBancorp\u2019s career average pay defined benefit\nplan, the U.S. Bancorp Cash Balance Pension\nPlan (which we refer to as the Old Cash\nBalance Plan), and the former Firstar\nCorporation\u2019s non-contributory defined benefit\nplan, which was primarily a final average pay\nplan (the Firstar Plan). The Firstar Plan was\nfrozen to new-hire employees on July 3, 2008,\nand to rehire employees on November 15, 2009.\nParticipation in the Pension Plan requires one\nyear of service with U.S. Bancorp or its\naffiliates. Employees who were hired or\nrehired prior to July 3, 2008, or November 15,\n2009, respectively, could elect to (i)\ncontinue to accrue benefits under the final\naverage pay formula of the Pension Plan, or\n(ii) accrue benefits under the U.S. Bank 2010\nCash Balance Plan (the 2010 Cash Balance\nPlan), which represents the cash balance\nportion of the Pension Plan. In the event of\nno election, participants defaulted into the\n2010 Cash Balance Plan. Participants that\nelected to receive pension benefits or\ndefaulted into the 2010 Cash Balance Plan had\ntheir existing benefits in the Pension Plan\nfrozen and earn future benefits under the cash\nbalance formula, under which participants\nreceive (i) annual pay credits based on\neligible pay multiplied by a percentage\ndetermined by their age and years of service,\nand (ii) an annual interest credit. For\nparticipants who elected to continue to accrue\nbenefits under the final average pay formula,\nbenefits are calculated using a final average\npay formula, based upon the participant\u2019s\nyears of service and average pay of the five-\nconsecutive-year period in which compensation\nwas the highest during the ten years prior to\nretirement. Normal retirement age is 65.\nVesting of benefits requires five years of\nservice for benefits under the final average\npay formula and three years of service for\nbenefits under the 2010 Cash Balance Plan. Mr.\nDolan is the only NEO (of those eligible at\nthe time) who elected to remain covered by the\nfinal average pay formula; all other NEOs are\ncovered by the 2010 Cash Balance Plan.\nAlthough no new benefits accrued under the Old\nCash Balance Plan and Firstar Plan for service\nafter 2001, benefits previously earned under\nthose plans have been preserved and will be\npart of a retiree\u2019s total retirement benefit.\nIn order to preserve the relative value of\nbenefits that use the final average pay\nformula, subsequent changes in compensation\n(but not in service) may increase the amount\nof those benefits. Messrs. Cecere and Dolan\nhave earned benefits under the Old Cash\nBalance Plan that will be included in their\nultimate retirement benefits. The U.S. Bank\nNon-Qualified Retirement Plan As federal laws\nlimit the amount of compensation we may\nconsider when determining benefits payable\nunder qualified defined benefit pension plans,\nwe also maintain a non-contributory, non-\nqualified retirement plan, the U.S. Bank Non-\nQualified Retirement Plan, which we refer to\nas the Non-Qualified Plan. The Non-Qualified\nPlan pays the excess pension benefits that\nwould have been payable under our current and\nprior qualified defined benefit pension plans\nif the federal limits were not in effect. As\npart of her compensation package, Ms. Kedia\nreceives an additional 23 years of service\nwhen calculating her pay credits in the Non-\nQualified Plan. The additional years of\nservice represent her service with her prior\nemployer. Messrs. Cecere and Dolan are\neligible for a supplemental benefit, which is\nalso paid under the Non-Qualified Plan, that\naugments benefits earned under the Pension\nPlan and the non-qualified excess benefits\ndiscussed above. Such supplemental benefits\nare subject to compliance with certain\nrestrictive covenant agreements. The\nsupplemental benefit ensures that eligible\nNEOs receive a total retirement benefit equal\nto a fixed percentage of the NEO\u2019s final\naverage cash compensation. For purposes of\nthis supplemental benefit, final average cash\ncompensation includes annual base salary,\nannual cash bonuses and other cash\ncompensation awards as determined by the\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee.\nEligibility for these supplemental benefits\nhas been determined by this committee based on\nindividual performance and level of\nresponsibility. Vesting of the supplemental\nbenefit is generally subject to certain\nconditions, including that an NEO provide a\ncertain number of years of service determined\nby the Compensation and Human Resources\nCommittee. Mr. Cecere is eligible for an\namount of total retirement benefits (comprised\nof components described above) at age 65 equal\nto 55% of the average cash compensation during\nhis final three years of service, reduced by\nhis estimated retirement benefits from Social\nSecurity. Mr. Cecere is fully vested in his\nsupplemental benefit. Mr. Dolan\u2019s supplemental\nbenefit was frozen in 2001. Accordingly, Mr.\nDolan has a frozen monthly annuity of $522, in\nwhich he is fully vested, payable as early as\nhis termination date. In accordance with his\nelection, Mr. Cecere\u2019s supplemental benefit\nwill be paid in the form of a lump sum. For\nthe supplemental benefits payable to Mr.\nDolan, the standard form is either a lump sum\nor a joint and survivor annuity, depending\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy             67    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\n\non the present value of the lump sum at\nretirement. As the present value of the\nsupplemental benefit for Mr. Dolan is\ncurrently less than $400,000, in accordance\nwith plan rules, his supplemental benefit will\ndefault to payment in a lump sum. Mr. Dolan\nhas the option to make an election to receive\nhis supplemental benefit as an annuity if the\nelection is made 12 months prior to his\ntermination date, he is over age 55, and the\npresent value of the supplemental benefit\nexceeds $50,000. The amount of the lump sum\ndistribution equals the actuarial equivalent\nof the annuity form of payment and is\ncalculated using substantially similar\nactuarial assumptions as for our pension plan\nobligations discussed in Note 16 to our\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The means\nof calculating the various annuity benefits\nare described in the pension plan.\nNonqualified deferred compensation Under the\nU.S. Bank Executive Employees Deferred\nCompensation Plan (2005 Statement) (the\nExecutive Deferred Compensation Plan),\neligible employees, including members of our\nsenior management and all of our NEOs, may\nchoose to defer all or a part of their annual\nbase salary and annual cash incentive\npayments. Cash compensation that is deferred\nis deemed to be invested in one of several\ninvestment funds, including a U.S. Bancorp\ncommon stock fund, as selected by the\nparticipant.

Participants\nare generally allowed to change their\ninvestment elections at any time. The\nmeasurement funds are merely measuring tools\nto determine the amount by which account\nbalances will be debited or credited to\nreflect deemed investment returns on deferred\ncompensation. Although the plan administrator\nhas established procedures permitting a\nparticipant to reallocate deferred amounts\namong these investment alternatives after the\ninitial election to defer, the election to\ndefer is irrevocable, and the deferred\ncompensation will not be paid to the\nparticipant until his or her retirement or\nearlier termination of employment. At that\ntime, the participant will receive, depending\nupon the payment choice and investment\nalternatives selected by the participant,\npayment of the amounts credited to the\nparticipant\u2019s account under the plan in a\nlump-sum payment or in annual installments\nover 5, 10, 15 or 20 years. Payments are made\nratably in cash from each of the investment\nalternatives in which the participant has a\nbalance. If a participant dies before the\nentire deferred amount has been distributed,\nthe undistributed portion will be paid to the\nparticipant\u2019s beneficiary in a single lump\nsum.

Mr. Welsh deferred cash\ncompensation each year from 2017 to 2024, for\na total deferred contribution of $1,742,981.\nOf this amount, $1,615,179 is deferred salary\nfrom 2019 and 2020 and deferred incentive pay\nearned for his 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023\nperformance. This deferred compensation was\nreported in the \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d\nin our proxy statement for the applicable\nyears. Mr. Welsh\u2019s total deferred contribution\nalso includes $127,802 in deferred salary from\n2017 and 2018 and deferred incentive pay\nearned for his 2018 performance that was not\nincluded in the \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d\nin our proxy statement, as Mr. Welsh was not a\nNEO in 2017 and 2018.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy             69    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\nPotential payments upon termination or change-\nin-control General None of our NEOs have\nemployment or standalone change-in-control\nagreements. Any NEO whose employment is\nvoluntarily or involuntarily terminated is\nentitled to the payments or other benefits\nthat have accrued and are vested under the\nbenefit plans discussed above in this proxy\nstatement. Except as is specifically described\nbelow with respect to disability, death,\nqualifying termination of employment following\na change-in-control (as defined in the equity\naward agreements), qualifying severance or\nearly retirement, no NEO is entitled to any\nother benefits upon any employment termination\nor change-in-control scenario, except as\nprovided by broad-based severance plans\ngenerally available to our employees. In\naccordance with applicable SEC rules,\ninformation presented for Mr. Welsh, whose\nemployment with the company ceased on October\n4, 2024, is only included for his termination\nof employment. Payments made upon disability\nCash payments:Under the terms of the Non-\nQualified Plan, Mr. Cecere is eligible for an\nannual disability benefit that is equal to 60%\nof his current annual cash compensation,\nsubject to compliance with certain restrictive\ncovenant agreements. The definition of\ndisability is generally that a participant is\nunable to engage in any substantial gainful\nactivity by reason of a physical or mental\nimpairment which can be expected to result in\ndeath or can be expected to last for a\ncontinuous period of not less than 12 months.\nThe definition of annual cash compensation is\nthe same definition as is used to calculate\nsupplemental pension benefits under this plan,\nwithout using a five-year average. The Non-\nQualified Plan provides that Mr. Cecere is\neligible to receive disability payments\nthrough the earlier of the cessation of his\ndisability or reaching his normal retirement\nage. Messrs. Stern, Dolan and Kotwal and Ms.\nKedia are eligible for an annual disability\nbenefit of $150,000 (i.e., 50% of annual cash\ncompensation, capped at $300,000 of\ncompensation) under the terms of the U.S. Bank\nLong-Term Disability Plan, our broad-based\ndisability program, insured by Reliance\nStandard Life Insurance Company. Optional\nadditional disability insurance is available\nfor purchase by those NEOs. The definition of\ndisability is generally that a participant is\nunable to perform material duties of his or\nher own occupation for 24 months following the\n26 week elimination period, or any occupation\nafter 24 months, as a result of an injury or\nsickness. The definition of annual cash\ncompensation is actual cash compensation for\nthe one-year period ending September 30, 2023.\nThe disability benefit for any NEO would be\nreduced by any benefits payable under the\nPension Plan, Social Security and worker\u2019s\ncompensation. The duration of disability\npayments is dependent upon the age of the\nparticipant when the disability occurs and\ntheir year of birth. Because each of Messrs.\nStern, Dolan and Kotwal and Ms. Kedia was\nunder age 64 as of December 2024, and born\nafter 1960, payments under the prior plan\nwould continue through the earlier of the\ncessation of their disability or reaching\ntheir normal retirement age, assuming all\nother plan conditions are met. Effect on\nequity awards:If any NEO\u2019s employment is\nterminated due to disability (as defined in\nthe equity award agreements), our equity award\nagreements provide that the vesting and other\nterms of those awards will continue as if the\ntermination of employment did not occur.\nUnvested equity awards continue to be subject\nto the applicable award terms, including any\nconfidentiality and non-solicitation agreement\nbetween the company and the NEO, performance-\nbased cancellation provisions, and applicable\nrecovery or clawback provisions. Noncompliance\nwith the terms of such agreement may result in\nthe forfeiture of unvested amounts. As of\nDecember 31, 2024, the amounts payable per the\naward schedule, subject to the terms and\nconditions of the applicable award agreement,\nare the same as the PRSU and RSU values\nincluded for each NEO (other than Mr. Welsh)\nunder the \u201cPayments upon death\u201d column in the\ntable below. Payments made upon death Cash\npayments:NEOs are eligible to receive life\ninsurance benefits under the same plans\navailable to our other employees. Their\nbenefit is equal to annual cash compensation,\ncapped at $300,000. In addition, optional term\nlife insurance is available for purchase. As\nthis benefit is generally available to all\nsalaried employees and does not discriminate\nin scope, terms, or operation in favor of the\nNEOs, the value has not been quantified in the\n\u201cPotential payments upon disability, death, or\ntermination after a change-in-control\u201d table.\nEffect on equity awards:Our equity award\nagreements provide for the acceleration of any\nunvested award upon death (including death\nafter termination of employment by reason of\nretirement or disability, as such terms are\ndefined in the equity award agreements), with\nall RSUs vesting in full and all PRSUs vesting\nat target if death occurs prior to the last\nday of the performance period and based on\nactual performance if death occurs on or after\nthe last day of the performance period but\nprior to scheduled vesting date. All of our\nNEO\u2019s stock options have vested, and the stock\noption award agreements provide that the\nadministrator of the NEO\u2019s estate has the\nearlier of a three-year period after death or\nthe original ten-year term of the options\nduring which to exercise the options.\n                                              \n    70      U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\nPayments upon qualifying termination after a\nchange-in-control Cash payments:None of our\nNEOs is entitled to any cash payments in\nconnection with a change-in-control of U.S.\nBancorp. Effect on equity awards:Our equity\naward agreements provide for the acceleration\nof vesting of any unvested award if an NEO\u2019s\ntermination of employment is a qualifying\ntermination (as defined in the equity award\nagreements) within 12 months after a change in\ncontrol of U.S. Bancorp other than for cause\n(both terms as defined in the equity award\nagreements), with all RSUs vesting in full and\nall PRSUs vesting at target if the qualifying\ntermination occurs prior to the last day of\nthe performance period and based on actual\nperformance if a qualifying termination occurs\non or after the last day of the performance\nperiod but prior to scheduled vesting date.\nAll of our NEO\u2019s stock options have vested.\nStock options may be exercised at any time\nduring the 12 months following the NEO\u2019s\ntermination or the original ten-year term of\nthe option, if earlier. Payments upon\nqualifying severance Broad-based cash\nseverance payments:Each NEO is covered under\nthe company\u2019s broad-based U.S. Bank Severance\nPay Program. Benefits under that program are\nbased on an employee\u2019s weekly compensation\nrate based on salary, years of service,\nposition grade level, and, if applicable,\ntarget annual bonus percentage (prorated based\non the number of months worked in the calendar\nyear of a qualifying termination). Severance\nbenefits are subject to the execution of a\nrelease in favor of the company and certain\npost-termination restrictions. In no case will\ntotal severance pay exceed (x) two times the\nindividual\u2019s cash compensation during the year\nimmediately preceding employment termination\nor (y) 52 times the individual\u2019s weekly\ncompensation rate based on salary plus any\nprorated target annual bonus percentage. If\ntheir employment had terminated on December\n31, 2024, cash severance amounts would have\nbeen payable in the following amounts for each\nNEO (other than Mr. Welsh): (i) Mr. Cecere,\n$6,300,000; (ii) Mr. Stern, $2,046,154; (iii)\nMs. Kedia, $3,000,000 (iv) Mr. Dolan,\n$2,852,500; and (v) Mr. Kotwal, $2,200,000. As\nMr. Welsh\u2019s termination of employment on\nOctober 4, 2024 was deemed to be a qualifying\ntermination under the terms of the Severance\nPay Program, Mr. Welsh received a cash payment\nof $1,750,000 pursuant such program. Effect on\nequity awards:If an NEO has been continuously\nemployed since the grant date and (i) has a\nqualifying severance defined as a qualifying\ntermination under the Severance Pay Program at\nleast six months from the grant date of the\napplicable award and (ii) the scheduled\nvesting dates of the award are on or before\nthe second anniversary date of the qualifying\nseverance, then any unvested PRSUs and RSUs\nwould continue to vest as though the NEO had\nremained employed through the second\nanniversary of the qualifying severance and\nthe final number of any PRSUs would be\ndetermined based on actual performance during\nthe applicable performance period. For Messrs.\nCecere and Dolan, who have met the definition\nof retirement eligibility under applicable\nequity awards, all unvested PRSUs and RSUs\nwould continue to vest per the award schedule\nand have the same values included for each\nunder the \u201cPayments upon death\u201d column in the\ntable below. Unvested equity awards continue\nto be subject to the applicable award terms,\nincluding any confidentiality and non-\nsolicitation agreement between the company and\nthe NEO, performance-based cancellation\nprovisions, and applicable recovery or\nclawback provisions. Noncompliance with the\nterms of such agreement may result in the\nforfeiture of unvested and/or unsettled\namounts. If each of the following NEO\u2019s\nemployment had terminated due to a qualifying\nseverance on December 31, 2024, the values of\ntheir PRSU and RSU awards that would continue\nto vest per schedule were as follows (see\nfootnote 2 below for calculation assumptions):\n(i) Mr. Stern, $1,386,544; (ii) Ms. Kedia,\n$7,567,663; and (iii) Mr. Kotwal, $6,068,383.\nAt December 31, 2024,the value of Mr. Welsh\u2019s\noutstanding PRSU and RSU awards that will\ncontinue to vest per the vesting schedule\nfollowing his termination of employment on\nOctober 4, 2024 is $6,674,198. Payments upon\nearly retirement The benefit amounts for each\nNEO in the Pension benefits table above assume\nthat each NEO will reach his or her retirement\nage. Due to the level of discount rates, the\npresent value of early retirement benefits\ncommencing immediately would exceed the values\nin the Pension benefits table by the following\namounts: (i) Mr. Cecere, $1,276,201; (ii) Mr.\nStern, $29,333; (iii) Ms. Kedia, $21,781; (iv)\nMr. Dolan, $0; (v) Mr. Kotwal, $12,047; and\n(vi) Mr. Welsh, $12,957. The incremental value\nfor Mr. Cecere includes one accelerated year\nof service for this SERP benefit upon reaching\nage 60, and his benefits are all now payable\nupon separation of service. As Messrs. Stern,\nKotwal and Welsh and Ms. Kedia have not yet\nattained age 62, only their qualified\nretirement benefits can be accelerated.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy             71    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\n\nQuantification of estimated payments and\nbenefits The following table shows potential\nannual cash payments to the NEOs upon\ndisability and the potential benefits the NEOs\ncould accrue through accelerated equity\nvesting upon death or involuntary termination\nof employment (other than for cause) following\na change-in-control of U.S. Bancorp.

The\nratio stated above is a reasonable estimate\ncalculated in a manner consistent with Item\n402(u) of Regulation S-K. In making this pay\nratio disclosure, other companies may use\nassumptions, estimates, and methodologies\ndifferent than ours; as a result, the\nforegoing information may not be directly\ncomparable to the information provided by\nother companies in our peer group or\notherwise. Median employee identification and\ncompensation calculation We identified our\nmedian employee based on compensation paid\nduring 2024 to all of our U.S.-based\nemployees, other than our CEO, who were\nemployed by us on December 31, 2024. We\nconsidered any person to whom we delivered a\nForm W-2 Wage and Tax Statement (Form W-2) for\nservices performed in 2024 to be a U.S.-based\nemployee, which includes full-time, part-time,\nand temporary workers. For purposes of\ndetermining the compensation paid to the\nemployees under consideration, we used\nearnings subject to Medicare tax as reported\nin Box 5, \u201cMedicare wages and tips,\u201d on each\nemployee\u2019s 2024 Form W-2. We did not annualize\nthe compensation of anyone who was employed by\nus for only part of the year. As allowed by\nItem 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are using\nthe same median employee for our 2024 pay\nratio disclosure as we used for our 2023 pay\nratio disclosure because there has been no\nchange in our employee population or employee\ncompensation arrangements that we believe\nwould significantly impact the pay ratio\ndisclosure. In accordance with the \u201c de\nminimis\u201d exemption provided in Item 402(u) of\nRegulation S-K, we excluded from consideration\nall of our non-U.S. employees. As of December\n31, 2024, the last business day of the year,\nwe had 3,367 non-U.S. employees, representing\napproximately 4.8% of our total U.S. and\nnon-U.S. workforce of approximately 70,263\nactive employees on that date. The excluded\nemployees worked in the following\njurisdictions: Poland (1,169), Ireland\n(1,147), United Kingdom (509), Canada (194),\nSpain (142), Lithuania (60), Luxembourg (54),\nGermany (49), Norway (25), Sweden (17), and\nCayman Islands (1). We determined our median\nemployee\u2019s total compensation in the same\nmanner that we determined the CEO\u2019s\ncompensation for purposes of this pay ratio\ndisclosure.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy             73    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\n\nPay versus performance As required by Section\n953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, and Item 402(v)\nof Regulation S-K, we are providing the\nfollowing information about the relationship\nbetween executive compensation actually paid\nand certain company financial performance\nmetrics. For further information concerning\nour compensation philosophy and how we align\nexecutive compensation with company financial\nperformance, refer to the \u201cCompensation\ndiscussion and analysis\u201d, beginning on page 42\nof this proxy statement. The following table\nprovides information showing the relationship\nduring 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020 between\n(1) executive compensation \u201cactually paid\u201d (as\ndefined by SEC rules and further described\nbelow) to (a) our principal executive officer\nor PEO (also referred to as our CEO) and (b)\nour non-PEO named executive officers (also\nreferred to below as other NEOs), on an\naverage basis, and (2) the company\u2019s financial\nperformance. We have identified adjusted\nReturn on Equity (Adjusted ROE) as our\nCompany-Selected Measure that represents, in\nour view, the most important financial measure\nused to link compensation actually paid for\n2024 to our performance. Adjusted ROE has a\nmaterial impact on CEO and NEO compensation\nbecause it is used to calculate performance-\nbased long-term incentive awards, as described\nin the \u201cCompensation discussion and analysis\u201d\nsection above.\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n\u200b\n1.                                            \nAndrew Cecere served as our CEO for the       \nentirety of 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020.  \n\u200b\n2.                                            \nThe other NEOs included in this calculation   \nfor each year are:                            \n\u200b\n2024\u2009\u2014\u2009\u2009John C.

compensation program and\ncompensation decisions reflect the guiding\nprinciples of aligning long-term performance\nwith shareholder interests. The metrics used\nwithin our incentive plans are selected to\nsupport these objectives. The most important\nfinancial performance measures used by the\ncompany to link compensation actually paid to\nthe company\u2019s NEOs for the most recently\ncompleted fiscal year to the company\u2019s\nperformance are as follows: \u25b6 Total\nShareholder Return (TSR) \u25b6 Adjusted ROE* \u25b6\nAdjusted EPS* \u25b6 Corporate Pretax Income \u25b6\nBusiness Line Pretax Income * Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures; see footnote 5 above for\ninformation on the calculation of Adjusted\nROE. As discussed in more detail on pages\n46-47 in the \u201cCompensation discussion and\nanalysis\u201d, Adjusted EPS is calculated from\ncompany reported EPS results, and adjusted to\naccount for notable items that are unusual or\nrelated to acquisitions, including merger-\nrelated charges, and variation in our loan\nloss reserve in connection with our adoption\nof the CECL accounting standard in January\n2020. Our adoption of CECL creates the\npotential for significant accounting\nvolatility and uncertainty with respect to the\nloan loss reserve that is often dependent upon\na number of judgmental factors and economic\nassumptions. In an effort to measure\nperformance based on actual credit losses, the\ncompany excludes changes in the allowance\ndriven by these factors and includes net\ncharge-offs in the determination.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy             75    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\nAnalysis of the information presented in the\n\u201cPay versus performance\u201d table While the\ncompany utilizes several performance measures\nto align executive compensation with company\nperformance, not all of those company measures\nare presented in the \u201cPay versus performance\u201d\ntable set forth above. Moreover, the company\ngenerally seeks to incentivize positive long-\nterm performance and, therefore, does not\nspecifically align the company\u2019s performance\nmeasures with compensation that is actually\npaid (as computed in accordance with Item\n402(v) of Regulation S-K) for a particular\nyear. In accordance with Item 402(v), the\ncompany is providing the following\ndescriptions of the relationships between\ninformation presented in the \u201cPay versus\nperformance\u201d table.\n                                              \n    TSR:                                      \n    TSR has the most direct and               \n    significant impact on CEO and NEO         \n    compensation actually paid. This is       \n    primarily driven by our compensation      \n    program design, which is structured       \n    with a significant portion of             \n    compensation at-risk, through RSUs and    \n    PRSUs. At least 64% of CEO                \n    compensation and more than 56% of NEO     \n    compensation is directly impacted by      \n    TSR.

The restricted stock units were\nfully vested at the time of grant, but the\nunderlying shares will not be delivered until\nthe director ceases to serve on the Board.\nEach non-employee director may elect to have\nall of his or her shares delivered promptly\nfollowing cessation of service or to have the\nshares delivered in ten annual installments.\nEach non-employee director is entitled to\nreceive additional fully vested restricted\nstock units having a fair market value equal\nto the amount of dividends he or she would\nhave received had restricted stock been\nawarded instead of restricted stock units.\nDirector stock ownership requirements The\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee has\nestablished stock ownership requirements for\neach non-employee director equal to five times\nthe value of the annual cash retainer. New\ndirectors must satisfy this minimum ownership\nlevel within five years of joining the Board.\nAs of December 31, 2024, all of the directors\nserving at that time were in compliance with\nour stock ownership guidelines or were on\ntrack to be in compliance by the end of his or\nher five-year compliance period. Deferred\ncompensation plan participation Under the U.S.\nBank Outside Directors Deferred Compensation\nPlan (2005 Statement) (the Director Deferred\nCompensation Plan), our non-employee directors\nmay elect to defer all or a part of their cash\nfees. Cash fees that are deferred are deemed\nto be invested in one of several investment\nfunds, including a U.S. Bancorp common stock\nfund, as selected by the participant. The\nterms and investment alternatives of the\nDirector Deferred Compensation Plan are\nsubstantially the same as those of the\nExecutive Deferred Compensation Plan, except\nthe U.S. Bancorp stock fund is generally paid\nin shares.

The Audit Committee has\nestablished a policy for pre-approving the\nservices provided by our independent auditor\nin accordance with the auditor independence\nrules of the SEC and the PCAOB. This policy\nrequires the review and pre-approval by the\nAudit Committee of all audit and permissible\nnon-audit services provided by our independent\nauditor and an annual review of the financial\nplan for audit fees. To ensure that auditor\nindependence is maintained, the Audit\nCommittee annually pre-approves the audit\nservices to be provided by our independent\nauditor and the related estimated fees for\nsuch services, as well as the nature and\nextent of specific types of audit-related, tax\nand other non-audit services to be provided by\nthe independent auditor during the year. As\nthe need arises, other specific permitted\nservices are pre-approved on a case-by-case\nbasis during the year. A request for pre-\napproval of services on a case-by-case basis\nmust be submitted by our Controller or Chief\nRisk Officer. These requests are required to\ninclude information on the nature of the\nparticular service to be provided, estimated\nrelated fees and management\u2019s assessment of\nthe impact of the service on the auditor\u2019s\nindependence. The Audit Committee has\ndelegated to its chair pre-approval authority\nbetween meetings of the Audit Committee. Any\npre-approvals made by the chair must be\nreported to the Audit Committee. The Audit\nCommittee will not delegate to management the\npre-approval of services to be performed by\nour independent auditor. All of the services\nprovided by our independent auditor in 2024\nand 2023, including services related to the\nAudit-Related Fees, Tax Fees and All Other\nFees described above, were approved by the\nAudit Committee under its pre-approval\npolicies after consideration of any impact of\nthese services on the auditor\u2019s independence.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy             81    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 3 \u2014 Ratification of\nselection of independent auditor\n\nProposal 3 \u2014 Ratification of selection of\nindependent auditor The Audit Committee has\nselected EY as our independent auditor for the\n2025 fiscal year. EY began serving as our\nindependent auditor for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2003. Our Audit Committee has\ncarefully considered the selection of EY as\nour independent auditor and has also\nconsidered whether there should be regular\nrotation of the independent external audit\nfirm. The Audit Committee annually reviews\nEY\u2019s independence and performance in\nconnection with the committee\u2019s determination\nof whether to retain EY or engage another firm\nas our independent auditor. In determining\nwhether to reappoint EY as U.S. Bancorp\u2019s\nindependent auditor, the Audit Committee took\ninto consideration a number of factors,\nincluding: \u25b6 the qualifications of EY, the\nlead audit partner, and other key personnel; \u25b6\nthe length of time the firm has been engaged;\n\u25b6 the quality of the historical and recent\nperformance on the U.S. Bancorp audit; \u25b6 EY\u2019s\ncapability and expertise in handling the\nbreadth and complexity of our operations; \u25b6\nexternal data on audit quality and\nperformance, including the results of PCAOB\ninspection reports on EY and EY\u2019s response to\nthe matters raised in those reports, as well\nas actions to continue to enhance the quality\nof its audit practices; \u25b6 the appropriateness\nof EY\u2019s fees on an absolute basis and as\ncompared to peer firms; and \u25b6 the advisability\nand potential impact of selecting a different\nindependent audit firm. In accordance with SEC\nrules and company policies, lead and\nconcurring audit partners are subject to a\nmaximum of five years of service in that\ncapacity. The process for selecting the audit\nfirm\u2019s lead engagement partner involves\nmeetings with the candidates for the role by\nmanagement; review and discussion with the\nchair of the Audit Committee, who meets with\nselected candidates; and further discussion\nwith the full committee. The members of the\nAudit Committee believe the continued\nretention of EY to serve as our independent\nauditor is in the best interests of our\ncompany and its shareholders. While we are not\nrequired to do so, we are submitting the\nselection of EY to serve as our independent\nauditor for the 2025 fiscal year for\nratification in order to ascertain the views\nof our shareholders on this appointment. If\nthe selection is not ratified, the Audit\nCommittee will reconsider its selection.\nRepresentatives of EY are expected to attend\nthe annual meeting, will be available to\nanswer shareholder questions, and will have\nthe opportunity to make a statement if they\ndesire to do so.\n                                              \n        \u200b                             FOR      \n        The Board of Directors                \n        recommends that you vote              \n        \u201cFOR\u201d ratification of the             \n        selection of Ernst &                  \n        Young LLP as the                      \n        independent auditor of                \n        U.S. Bancorp for the 2025             \n        fiscal year.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n    82      U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 4 \u2014 Shareholder\nproposal regarding a report on board oversight\nof risks relating to discrimination Proposal 4\n\u2014 Shareholder proposal regarding a report on\nboard oversight of risks relating to\ndiscrimination The Board of Directors\nrecommends that you vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d this\nshareholder proposal for the reasons set forth\nbelow. Shareholder proposal American\nConservative Values ETF, 9711 Washingtonian\nBlvd., Suite 550, Gaithersburg, Maryland\n20878, the holder of 5,788 shares of our\ncommon stock, has advised us that it intends\nto introduce the following resolution at the\nannual meeting.

Report on\nRisks of Politicized De-banking Supporting\nStatement: Financial institutions control\naccess to the marketplace. On account of their\nunique and pivotal role in America\u2019s economy,\nmany federal and state laws already prohibit\nthem from discriminating against customers. As\nshareholders of U.S Bancorp, we believe it is\nessential for the company to provide financial\nservices on an equal basis without regard to\nfactors such as race, color, religion, sex,\nnational origin, or social, political, or\nreligious views. We are concerned with the\nrising trend of financial institutions\npoliticizing their services, whether through\nradical environmental commitments, icolluding\nwith federal law enforcement to profile\nconservative and religious Americans as\ndomestic terrorist threats, iior outright\ndenying service to certain industries,\niiipolitical groups, Muslims, or other\nreligious groups. iv Numerous state attorneys\ngeneral, vfinancial officers, viand\nagriculture commissioners viihave warned major\nfinancial institutions about their conduct.\nDemocrats and Republican Congress members are\ninvestigating. viiiThe Supreme Court recently\nand unanimously sided with the NRA and ACLU to\ncondemn any government officials who would\ncoerce financial institutions to deny service\nto their political opponents. ix Many states\nhave also passed laws protecting state pension\nfunds and contracts from politicized finance.\nxAnd Tennessee, Florida, and Texas have\ndirectly prohibited de-banking. xi But the\n2023 edition of the Viewpoint Diversity\nBusiness lndex xiishows that 69% of the\nlargest financial institutions include vague\nand subjective grounds to deny service like\n\u201creputational risk,\u201d \u201csocial risk,\u201d\n\u201cmisinformation,\u201d \u201chate speech\u201d or\n\u201cintolerance.\u201d This includes U.S. Bancorp,\nwhich is subject to problematic \u201creputational\nrisk\u201d regulations and can close a customer\u2019s\naccount \u201cfor any reason or for no reason at\nall.\u201d xiiiU.S. Bancorp also made headlines\nlast year when it de-banked the Constitution\nParty of Idaho. These kinds of terms encourage\nfinancial institutions to deny or restrict\nservice for arbitrary or discriminatory\nreasons. They also give fringe activists and\ngovernments a foothold to demand that private\nfinancial institutions deny service under the\nsweeping, unfettered discretion that such\npolicies provide. When companies engage in\nthis kind of discrimination, they hinder the\nability of Americans to access the marketplace\nand instead become de factoregulators and\ncensors. This undermines the fundamental\nfreedoms of our country and is an affront to\nthe public trust. U.S. Bancorp needs to\nincrease transparency around these practices\nand provide assurances to customers that it\ndoes not discriminate based on a customer\u2019s\npolitical or religious views.\nResolved:Shareholders request the Board of\nDirectors of U.S. Bancorp conduct an\nevaluation and issue a report within the next\nyear, at reasonable cost and excluding\nproprietary information and disclosure of\nanything that would constitute an admission of\npending litigation, evaluating how it oversees\nrisks related to discrimination against\ncustomers based on their race, color, religion\n(including religious views), sex, national\norigin, or political views, and whether such\ndiscrimination may impact customers and other\nindividuals\u2019 exercise of their\nconstitutionally protected civil rights.\nihttps://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-banking/\niihttps://judiciary.house.gov/media/press-\nreleases/new-report-exposes-massive-\ngovernment-surveillance-americans-financiaI-\ndata;\nhttps://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-\nreleases/warren-omar-lawmakers_seek-\ninformation-from-big-banks-on-account-closure-\npractices-that-discriminate-against-muslim-\namericans\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy             83    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 4 \u2014 Shareholder\nproposal regarding a report on board oversight\nof risks relating to discrimination\niiihttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bank-\namerica-stops-financing-makers-military-style-\nrifles-n865106;\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/usa-\nimmigration/bank-of-america-to-stop-financing-\noperators-of-private-prisons-detention-\ncenters-\nidUSL2N23X1JL ivhttps://www.viewpointdiversity\nscore.org/resources/instances-of-viewpoint-\nbased-de-banking;\nhttps://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-\nreleases/warren-omar-lawmakers_seek-\ninformation-from-big-banks-on-account-closure-\npractices-that-discriminate-against-muslim-\namericans vhttps://www.ag.ky.gov/Press Release\nAttachments/23.5.2 Letter to Chase.pdf;\nhttps://ag.ks.gov/docs/default-\nsource/documents/bank-of-america-letter.pdf;\nhttps://dojmt.gov/wp-content/uploads/WF-\ndebanking-letter-Final.pdf\nvihttps://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/state-\nfinancial-officers-call-jpmorgan-chase-\naddress-politically-motivated-de-banking;\nhttps://sfof.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2024/04/SFOF_BoA_Letter.pdf\nviihttps://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/dozen-\nstate-gop-agriculture-commissioners-launch-\nprobe-us-banks-esg-investing\nviiihttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/elizabeth-\nwarren-banks-muslims-\ndiscrimination_n_65d76fbce4b0189a6a7d2bf3;\nhttps://judiciary.house.gov/media/press-\nreleases/chairman-jordan-expands-financial-\nsurveillance-investigation-other-major ixhttps\n://www.presstelegram.com/2024/06/06/aclu-and-\nnra-unite-to-defend-the-first-amendment/ xhttp\ns://drive.google.com/file/d/1VJ82mMNupoFSZPQ98\nnLcW7AtcyBQWB18/view xihttps://www.hklaw.com/e\nn/insights/publications/2023/06/new-florida-\nlaw-prohibits-use-of-esg-factors-in xiihttps:/\n/viewpointdiversityscore.org/business-index xi\niihttps://www.viewpointdiversityscore.org/comp\nany/us-bancorp Board of Directors\u2019 Response\nOur policies and practices are designed to\nprevent discrimination in the provision of our\nproducts and services. We build trusted\nrelationships with our customers and the\ncommunities we serve through our commitment to\nthe highest ethical standards and following\nall laws and regulations that prohibit us from\ndiscriminating in our business. Our Code of\nEthics and Business Conduct (Code) provides\nour employees with the principles to help\nguide their conduct with customers and others\nwho do business with U.S. Bank. It makes clear\nour expectations that we act ethically and\nwith integrity and follow all policies, laws\nand regulations, including fair lending and\nresponsible banking laws, and that we do not\ntolerate unlawful discrimination, harassment\nor retaliation of any of kind. Our policies,\nincluding our fair and responsible banking\npolicy, prohibit discrimination in lending\nbased on race, color, sex, religion, national\norigin, political affiliation or any other\nbasis prohibited by law. Our approach to\nmanaging and overseeing customer relationships\nbalances the company\u2019s overall business\nstrategy with its risk tolerance for a broad\nrange of risks, including operational,\ncompliance, and credit risks. However, it is\nnot our policy or practice to deny services\nbased on political or religious beliefs. We\nask all of our employees to attest each year\nthat they understand and will abide by the\nexpectations described in the Code, including\ndoing business in a fair and responsible\nmanner and complying with our anti-\ndiscrimination policies. As part of our\ncommitment to treat customers in a non-\ndiscriminatory manner, our fair and\nresponsible banking program also includes\nannual training provided to branch, lending\nand other employees. Any customer complaints\nof discrimination are escalated to our\ncompliance team for review and our Enterprise\nComplaints Committee that is part of our risk\ngovernance structure provides oversight of\nthat complaint monitoring. Our Board and its\ncommittees provide independent oversight of\nour anti-discrimination policies and\npractices, including related risk management\npractices. Our ethics, culture of integrity,\nand fair treatment of customers are part of\nthe tone at the top set by our Board and\nmanagement and are embedded in our\ncomprehensive governance and risk management\nframework overseen by the Board and its\ncommittees.

What is a proxy? It is your\ndesignation of another person to vote stock\nyou own. That other person is called a proxy.\nIf you designate someone as your proxy in a\nwritten document, that document is also called\na proxy or a proxy card. When you designate a\nproxy, you also may direct the proxy how to\nvote your shares. We refer to this as your\n\u201cproxy vote.\u201d By providing your proxy, you\nwill be designating Andrew Cecere, our\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, and\nKathryn V. Purdom, our Corporate Secretary, as\nyour proxy to cast your vote in accordance\nwith your instructions at our 2025 annual\nmeeting of shareholders. What is the purpose\nof the meeting?

Management will also report on our\n2024 performance and, once the business of the\nannual meeting is concluded, respond to\nquestions submitted in writing during or\nbefore the meeting.\n                                              \n      How can I access the proxy              \n      materials and vote my shares?           \n      The instructions for accessing the      \n      proxy materials and voting can be       \n      found in the information you            \n      received either by mail or e-mail.      \n      Depending on how you received the       \n      proxy materials, you may vote by        \n      Internet, telephone or mail.

However, your proxy vote will\nserve as voting instructions to the plan\ntrustee. Your voting instructions must be\nreceived at least five days prior to the\nannual meeting in order to count. In\naccordance with the terms of the plan, the\ntrustee will vote all of the shares held in\nthe plan in the same proportion as the actual\nproxy votes submitted by plan participants at\nleast five days prior to the annual meeting.\nWhy did I receive a notice regarding the\nInternet availability of proxy materials\ninstead of a printed copy of the proxy\nmaterials? In accordance with rules adopted by\nthe SEC, we are furnishing our proxy materials\nto our shareholders primarily over the\nInternet instead of mailing printed copies of\nthose materials to each shareholder. By doing\nso, we reduce costs and lessen the\nenvironmental impact of our proxy\nsolicitation. On or about March 5, 2025, we\nmailed a notice of Internet availability of\nthe proxy materials to most of our\nshareholders. The notice contains instructions\nabout how to access our proxy materials and\nvote online. This notice is not a proxy card\nand cannot be used to vote your shares. If you\nreceived a notice but would like to receive a\npaper copy of our proxy materials, please\nfollow the instructions on the notice. Who is\nentitled to vote at the meeting?

Holders of our\ncommon stock are entitled to one vote per\nshare. Therefore, a total of 1,558,010,529\nvotes are entitled to be cast at the meeting.\nThere is no cumulative voting. How many shares\nmust be present to hold the meeting? In\naccordance with our bylaws, shares equal to at\nleast one-third of the voting power of our\noutstanding shares of common stock as of the\nrecord date must be present at the meeting in\norder to hold the meeting and conduct\nbusiness. This is called a quorum. Your shares\nare counted as present at the meeting if: \u25b6\nyou have properly submitted a proxy vote by\nInternet, telephone or mail, even if you\nabstain from voting on one or more matters; or\n\u25b6 you hold your shares in street name (as\ndiscussed below) and you provide voting\ninstructions to your broker, bank, trust\ncompany or other nominee or you do not provide\nvoting instructions but your broker, bank,\ntrust company or other nominee uses its\ndiscretionary authority to vote your shares on\nthe ratification of the selection of our\nindependent auditor. What is the difference\nbetween a shareholder of record and a \u201cstreet\nname\u201d holder? If your shares are registered\ndirectly in your name with our transfer agent,\nComputershare Investor Services, you are\nconsidered the shareholder of record with\nrespect to those shares.

However, you\nstill are considered the beneficial owner of\nthose shares, and your shares are said to be\nheld in \u201cstreet name.\u201d Street name holders\ngenerally cannot vote their shares directly\nand must instead instruct the broker, bank,\ntrust company or other nominee how to vote\ntheir shares using the voting instruction form\nprovided by it.

If you hold\nyour shares in street name and do not provide\nvoting instructions, your broker, bank, trust\ncompany or other nominee has discretionary\nauthority to vote your shares on the\nratification of the selection of EY as our\nindependent auditor. However, in the absence\nof your specific instructions as to how to\nvote, your broker, bank, trust company or\nother nominee does not have discretionary\nauthority to vote on any other proposal. Such\na situation results in a \u201cbroker non-vote,\u201d\nwhich does not have an effect on the outcome\nof the proposal. It is important, therefore,\nthat you provide instructions to your broker,\nbank, trust company or other nominee so that\nyour vote with respect to the other proposals\nis counted. What is the voting standard and\nwhat is the effect of abstentions? You may\nvote \u201cFOR,\u201d \u201cAGAINST\u201d or \u201cABSTAIN\u201d with\nrespect to the election of each nominee for\nthe Board of Directors (Proposal 1), the\nadvisory vote on executive compensation\n(Proposal 2), the ratification of the\nselection of our independent auditor (Proposal\n3) and the shareholder proposal regarding a\nreport on board oversight of risks relating to\ndiscrimination (Proposal 4). The following\ntable summarizes the voting standard\napplicable to each proposal and the effect of\nan \u201cABSTAIN\u201d vote in each instance.\n                                              \n                                  Effect      \n    Proposal       Voting         of\u2009         \n                   standard       \u201cABSTAI\u2026    \n                                  vote        \n                   The                        \n                   nominee                    \n                   is                         \n                   elected                    \n                   if the                     \n                   number of                  \n                   votes                      \n    Election       cast                       \n    of             \u201cFOR\u201d him      No          \n    directors      or her         effect      \n                   exceeds                    \n                   the                        \n                   number of                  \n                   votes                      \n                   cast                       \n                   \u201cAGAINST\u201d                  \n                   him or                     \n                   her                        \n                   The                        \n                   proposal                   \n                   is                         \n                   approved                   \n                   if\u2009 \u201cFOR\u201d                  \n                   votes are      Same        \n                   cast by        effect      \n    Other          the            as          \n    proposals      majority       \u201cAGAINS\u2026    \n                   of shares      vote        \n                   present                    \n                   and                        \n                   entitled                   \n                   to vote                    \n                   on the                     \n                   matter                     \n                                              \nWhat does it mean if I receive more than one\nnotice of Internet availability of proxy\nmaterials, proxy card, voting instruction\nform, or e-mail with instructions on how to\naccess the proxy materials? If you receive\nmore than one notice of Internet availability\nof proxy materials, proxy card, voting\ninstruction form, or e-mail with instructions\non how to access the proxy materials, it means\nthat you hold shares in more than one account.\nTo ensure that all of your shares are voted,\nvote separately for each notice of Internet\navailability of proxy materials, proxy card,\nvoting instruction form, and e-mail you\nreceive. Can I change my vote after submitting\nmy proxy? Yes. You may revoke your proxy and\nchange your vote at any time before your proxy\nis voted at the annual meeting. If you are a\nshareholder of record, you may revoke your\nproxy and change your vote by: \u25b6 voting again\nover the Internet or by telephone by no later\nthan 11:59 p.m., eastern time, on April 14,\n2025, or by submitting a proxy card with a\nlater date and returning it so that it is\nreceived by April 14, 2025; \u25b6 voting again\nduring the meeting; or \u25b6 submitting written\nnotice of revocation to our Corporate\nSecretary at the address shown below so that\nit is received by April 14, 2025. To request\nan additional proxy card, or if you have any\nquestions about the annual meeting or how to\nvote or revoke your proxy, you should write to\nInvestor Relations, U.S. Bancorp, 800 Nicollet\nMall, Minneapolis, MN 55402 or call\n866.775.9668. If you hold your shares in\nstreet name, contact your broker, bank, trust\ncompany or other nominee regarding how to\nrevoke your proxy and change your vote. If you\nare a participant in the U.S. Bank 401(k)\nSavings Plan, you may revoke your proxy and\nchange your vote as described above, but only\nuntil 11:59 p.m., eastern time, on April 10,\n2025. Will my vote be kept confidential? Yes.\nWe have procedures to ensure that all proxies,\nballots and voting tabulations that identify\nshareholders are kept permanently\nconfidential, except as follows: to meet legal\nrequirements, to assert claims for or defend\nclaims against our company, to allow\nauthorized individuals to count and certify\nthe results of the shareholder vote if a proxy\nsolicitation in opposition to the Board takes\nplace, or to respond to shareholders who have\nwritten comments on proxy cards or who have\nrequested disclosure. We also have the voting\ntabulations performed by an independent third\nparty.\n                                              \n    90      U.S. Bancorp 2025 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Questions and answers about\nthe annual meeting and voting\n\nWho will count the votes? Representatives of\nBroadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., our\ntabulation agent, will tabulate the votes and\nact as independent inspectors of election.\nWhere can I find the voting results? We expect\nto announce the preliminary voting results for\neach proposal at our 2025 annual meeting of\nshareholders. The final voting results will be\nreported in a Current Report on Form 8-K that\nwill be filed with the SEC and made available\non our website. Who pays for the cost of proxy\npreparation and solicitation? We pay for the\ncost of proxy preparation and solicitation,\nincluding the reasonable charges and expenses\nof brokerage firms, banks, trust companies or\nother nominees for forwarding proxy materials\nto street name holders. We have retained\nAlliance Advisors, LLC, to assist in the\nsolicitation of proxies for the annual meeting\nfor a fee of $26,000, plus associated costs\nand expenses. We are soliciting proxies\nprimarily by mail. In addition, our directors,\nofficers and employees may solicit proxies by\ntelephone, facsimile, e-mail or in person.\nThey will not receive any additional\ncompensation for these activities. Do we\n\u201chousehold\u201d annual meeting materials? The SEC\nrules allow a single copy of the notice of\nInternet availability of proxy materials or\nproxy statement and annual report to be\ndelivered to multiple shareholders sharing the\nsame address and last name, or who we\nreasonably believe are members of the same\nfamily, and who consent to receive a single\ncopy of these materials in a manner provided\nby these rules. This practice is referred to\nas \u201chouseholding.\u201d Although we do not\nhousehold for our registered shareholders, we\nunderstand that some brokers, banks, trust\ncompanies and other nominees household U.S.\nBancorp notices of Internet availability of\nproxy materials or proxy statements and annual\nreports, delivering a single copy of each to\nmultiple shareholders sharing an address\nunless contrary instructions have been\nreceived from the affected shareholders. Once\nyou have received notice from your broker,\nbank, trust company or other nominee that it\nwill be householding materials to your\naddress, householding will continue until you\nare notified otherwise or until you revoke\nyour consent. If, at any time, you no longer\nwish to participate in householding and would\nprefer to receive a separate copy of our\nnotice of Internet availability of proxy\nmaterials or proxy statement or annual report,\nor if you are receiving multiple copies of any\nof these documents and wish to receive only\none, please notify your broker, bank, trust\ncompany or other nominee. We will deliver\npromptly upon written or oral request a\nseparate copy of our notice of Internet\navailability of proxy materials, proxy\nstatement and/or our annual report to a\nshareholder at a shared address to which a\nsingle copy was delivered. For copies of any\nof these documents, shareholders should write\nto Investor Relations, U.S. Bancorp, BC-\nMN-H23K, 800 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis,\nMinnesota 55402, or call 866.775.9668. How can\nI receive my proxy materials by e-mail in the\nfuture? Instead of receiving future paper\ncopies of the notice of Internet availability\nof proxy materials or our proxy materials by\nmail, you can elect to receive an e-mail with\nlinks to these documents, your control number\nand instructions for voting over the Internet.\nOpting to receive your proxy materials by\ne-mail will save the cost of producing and\nmailing documents to you and will also help\nconserve environmental resources. Your e-mail\naddress will be kept separate from any other\ncompany operations and will be used for no\nother purpose. If we mailed you a notice of\nInternet availability of proxy materials or a\nprinted copy of our proxy statement and annual\nreport and you would like to sign up to\nreceive these materials by e-mail in the\nfuture, you can choose this option by: \u25b6\nfollowing the instructions provided on your\nproxy card or voting instruction form if you\nreceived a paper copy of the proxy materials;\n\u25b6 following the instructions provided when you\nvote over the Internet; or \u25b6 going to\nhttp://enroll.icsdelivery.com/usb and\nfollowing the instructions provided. You may\nrevoke this request at any time by following\nthe instructions at\nhttp://enroll.icsdelivery.com/usb. Your\nelection will remain in effect unless you\nrevoke it later.\n                                              \n      We encourage you to sign up for         \n      electronic delivery of our proxy        \n      materials.

The company\u2019s major\nlines of business are Consumer and Business\nBanking, Payment Services, Wealth, Corporate,\nCommercial and Institutional Banking, and\nTreasury and Corporate Support. We provide the\npercentage of revenue attributable to each\nbusiness line, excluding Treasury and\nCorporate Support, as it reflects our\ncompany\u2019s diversified mix of businesses. We\ndisclose the return on tangible common equity\nas we believe it is a useful financial measure\nto assess the company\u2019s use of equity. In\naddition, we have included the other financial\nmeasures listed above on an adjusted basis to\nexclude notable items, including related to\nthe merger and integration charges, balance\nsheet repositioning and capital management\nactions, FDIC special assessment charges,\ncharges related to lease impairments and\noperational efficiency actions, a foundation\ncontribution and a favorable discrete tax\nsettlement, in order to provide a greater\nunderstanding of ongoing operations and better\ncomparability with prior year results. We use\nnet interest income on a taxable-equivalent\nbasis to calculate our efficiency ratio\nbecause we believe that this presentation is\nthe preferred industry measurement of net\ninterest income as it provides a relevant\ncomparison of net interest income arising from\ntaxable and tax-exempt sources.
