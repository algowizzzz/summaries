The Company\u2019s\nemployee surveying programs enable the Company\nto collect quantitative and qualitative\nfeedback from employees on an ongoing basis.\nThe Company offers various mentorship and\nleadership development opportunities that\nenable participants to enhance key skills and\nwork experiences.\n\nAs part of its talent strategy, the Company\nstrives to support continuous employee\nlearning and development. The Company provides\nseveral talent development opportunities for\nemployees to enhance skills that are critical\nin the current and future working environment\nand empowers employees to discover ways to\nthrive and grow in their careers. The Company\nhas introduced and enhanced several learning\nprograms in 2024, including the Product\nAcademy, Foundational Leadership and Skill of\nthe Month. The Company also launched the\nSkills Academy, a learning platform focused on\nthe development of skills for all employees.\nIn 2024, the Company also held a Development\nDay, highlighting the importance of self-\ndevelopment and the Company\u2019s commitment to\nsupporting learning. The Company conducts job\nskills and customer interaction training for\nits frontline employees that focuses on\nbuilding skills to serve all the Company's\ncustomers. In addition, every employee is\nautomatically included in the Company\u2019s\nDevelopment Network that provides all\nemployees with opportunities to network,\nlearn, develop leadership skills and\ncontribute to the Company and its communities.\nSuccession planning and talent development\nprocesses remain a top priority for the\nCompany along with continuous improvements to\nits training and development programs. During\n2024, employees completed over 1.8 million\nhours of training through the Company\u2019s\nenterprise learning programs to better support\ntheir professional development and customer\nand business needs.\n\nCompensation, Health & Wellness Programs\nMaintaining competitive compensation and\nbenefits practices is a continued focus for\nthe Company, with periodic peer and\nbenchmarking reviews used to assist with\ncompetitive alignment and employee retention.\nAs part of the Company's efforts to enhance\npay transparency, all open positions in the\nUnited States have a disclosed compensation\nrange.\n\nThe Company provides its employees with\ncomprehensive benefits programs, including\ncompetitive healthcare, retirement, leave,\nrecognition, wellness, disability, life\ninsurance, time-off and educational assistance\nprograms, based on the Company\u2019s recognition\nthat such benefits are important to attract\nand retain employees. In addition to its\ncompetitive 401(k) matching program, the\nCompany maintains an active cash balance\npension program for its U.S. employees,\nincluding newly hired employees.\n                                              \n  Competition                                 \n                                              \nThe financial services industry is highly\ncompetitive. The Company competes with other\ncommercial banks, savings and loan\nassociations, mutual savings banks, finance\ncompanies, mortgage banking companies, credit\nunions, investment companies, credit card\ncompanies and a variety of other financial\nservices, advisory and technology companies.\nThe financial services industry continues to\nundergo rapid technological change with\nfrequent introductions of new technology-\ndriven products and services, including\ninnovative ways that customers can make\npayments or manage their accounts, such as\nthrough the use of mobile payments, digital\nwallets or digital currencies. In recent\nyears, competition has increased from\ninstitutions not subject to the same\nregulatory restrictions as domestic banks and\nbank holding companies, including by financial\ntechnology companies, or \u201cfintechs,\u201d which may\noffer bank-like products or services that\ncompete directly with the Company\u2019s products\nand services. Competition is based on a number\nof factors, including, among others, customer\nservice, quality and range of products and\nservices offered, price, reputation, interest\nrates on loans and deposits, lending limits\nand customer convenience, including the\nability to address customer needs by using\ntechnology to provide products and services\nthat customers want to adopt. The Company\u2019s\nability to continue to compete effectively\nalso depends in large part on its ability to\nattract new employees and retain\n                      3                       \nand motivate existing employees, while\nmanaging compensation and other costs. For\nadditional information relating to how the\nCompany attracts and retains employees, see\n\u201cHuman Capital\u201d above.\n                                              \n  Government Policies                         \n                                              \nThe operations of the Company\u2019s various\nbusinesses are affected by federal and state\nlaws and legislative changes and by policies\nof various regulatory authorities of the\nUnited States and the numerous states and\nforeign countries in which they operate. These\nlaws, rules and policies include, for example,\nstatutory maximum legal lending rates,\ndomestic monetary policies of the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (the\n\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d), United States fiscal\npolicy, international currency regulations and\nmonetary policies and capital adequacy and\nliquidity constraints imposed by bank\nregulatory agencies.\n                                              \n  Supervision and Regulation                  \n                                              \nU.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject\nto the extensive regulatory framework\napplicable to bank holding companies (\u201cBHCs\u201d)\nand their subsidiaries. This regulatory\nframework is intended primarily for the\nprotection of depositors, the deposit\ninsurance fund (the \u201cDIF\u201d) of the FDIC,\nconsumers, the stability of the financial\nsystem in the United States, and the health of\nthe national economy, and not for investors in\nthe Company.\n\nThis section summarizes certain provisions of\nthe principal laws and regulations applicable\nto the Company and its subsidiaries. The\ndescriptions are not intended to be complete\nand are qualified in their entirety by\nreference to the full text of the statutes and\nregulations described below.\n\nGeneral As a BHC, the Company is subject to\nregulation under the BHC Act and to\ninspection, examination and supervision by the\nFederal Reserve. USBNA and its subsidiaries\nare subject to regulation, examination and\nsupervision primarily by the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (the \u201cOCC\u201d) and\nalso by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (the\n\u201cCFPB\u201d). The Company and its subsidiaries are\nalso subject to regulation and examination by\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n\u201cSEC\u201d) and the Commodities Futures Trading\nCommission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) in certain areas.\n\nSupervision and regulation by the responsible\nbank regulatory agencies generally include\ncomprehensive annual reviews of all major\naspects of the Company\u2019s and USBNA\u2019s business\nand condition, regular on-site examinations,\nand imposition of periodic reporting\nrequirements and limitations on investments\nand certain types of activities. If an\napplicable regulatory agency deems the Company\nto be operating in a manner that is\ninconsistent with safe and sound banking\npractices, such agency can require the entry\ninto informal or formal supervisory\nagreements, including board resolutions,\nmemoranda of understanding, written agreements\nand consent or cease and desist orders,\npursuant to which the Company would be\nrequired to take identified corrective actions\nto address cited concerns and to refrain from\ntaking certain actions. Supervision and\nexaminations are confidential, and the\noutcomes of these actions generally are not\nmade public.\n\nBanking and other financial services statutes,\nregulations and policies are continually under\nreview by the United States Congress, state\nlegislatures and federal and state regulatory\nagencies. In addition to laws and regulations,\nstate and federal bank regulatory agencies may\nissue policy statements, interpretive letters\nand similar written guidance applicable to the\nCompany and its subsidiaries. Any change in\nthe statutes, regulations or regulatory\npolicies applicable to the Company, including\nchanges in their interpretation or\nimplementation, could have a material effect\non its business or organization.\n\nThe change in the U.S. presidential\nadministration and control of the U.S. Senate\nwill likely result in changing federal\nregulatory priorities. Further, legal\nchallenges to regulations have become more\nprevalent, adding to the uncertainty in the\napplicability of new or proposed laws and\nregulations. As federal government agencies\nshift priorities, states are likely to shift\nas well (including in certain states, as a\nresponse to a perceived void in federal\nregulation). Any shifts in state or federal\nregulatory priorities may result in increased\ncompliance costs and regulatory risks. Failure\nto comply with any new law or regulation could\nresult in litigation, regulatory enforcement\nactions and harm to the Company's reputation.\n\nAs a BHC with over $100 billion in total\nconsolidated assets, the Company is subject to\nthe Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s enhanced prudential\nstandards, as applied to \u201cCategory III\u201d\ninstitutions under the federal banking\nregulators\u2019 rules that tailor how enhanced\nprudential standards apply to large U.S.\nbanking organizations (the \u201cTailoring Rules\u201d).\nThe Tailoring Rules also apply certain\nenhanced prudential standards to its\nsubsidiary depository institution, USBNA, as\ndescribed in more detail below. The Company\nwill continue to be subject to the regulatory\ncapital and liquidity requirements applicable\nto Category III institutions until otherwise\nrequired under the Tailoring Rules (i.e.,\nuntil the Company\u2019s total average consolidated\nassets for the then most recent four quarters\nequal $700 billion or more or the amount of\nthe Company\u2019s average cross-jurisdictional\nactivities for the then most recent four\nquarters equals $75 billion or more).\n\nSupervisory Ratings Federal banking regulators\nregularly examine the Company and its insured\ndepository institution subsidiary, USBNA.\nFollowing those exams, the Company (under the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s Large Financial Institution\nRating System) and USBNA (under the CAMELS\nrating system) are assigned supervisory\nratings. Disclosure of these ratings to third\nparties is not allowed without permission of\nthe issuing regulator. A downgrade in these\nratings could limit the Company\u2019s ability to\npursue acquisitions or conduct other\nexpansionary activities for a period of time,\nrequire new or additional regulatory approvals\nbefore engaging in certain other business\nactivities or investments, affect USBNA\u2019s\ndeposit insurance assessment rates, limit the\nCompany's access to funding through\ngovernment-sponsored liquidity programs, and\nimpose additional recordkeeping and corporate\ngovernance requirements, as well as generally\nincrease regulatory scrutiny of the Company.\n                      4                       \nBHC Activities The Company is a BHC under the\nBHC Act and has elected to be a financial\nholding company (\u201cFHC\u201d). BHCs that qualify and\nelect to be treated as FHCs may engage in, and\naffiliate with financial companies engaging\nin, a broader range of activities than would\notherwise be permitted for a BHC.\n\nIf an FHC or a depository institution\ncontrolled by an FHC ceases to be well-\ncapitalized or well-managed, the Federal\nReserve may impose corrective capital and\nmanagerial requirements on the FHC and may\nplace limitations on its ability to conduct\nall of the business activities that FHCs are\ngenerally permitted to conduct and its ability\nto make certain acquisitions. See \u201cPermissible\nBusiness Activities\u201d below. Disclosure of any\nfailure to meet these standards is not allowed\nwithout permission of the Federal Reserve. If\nthe failure to meet these standards persists,\nthe FHC may be required to divest its\ndepository institution subsidiaries or cease\nall activities other than those activities\nthat may be conducted by BHCs that are not\nFHCs. In addition, if a depository institution\ncontrolled by an FHC does not receive a\nCommunity Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) rating of\nat least \u201csatisfactory\u201d at its most recent\nexamination, the Federal Reserve will prohibit\nthe FHC from conducting new business\nactivities that FHCs are generally permitted\nto conduct and from making certain\nacquisitions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also requires BHCs to meet\ncertain applicable capital and management\nstandards. Failure by the Company to meet\nthese standards could limit the Company from\nengaging in any new activity or acquiring\nother companies without the prior approval of\nthe Federal Reserve.\n\nPermissible Business Activities As an FHC, the\nCompany may affiliate with securities firms\nand insurance companies and engage in other\nactivities that are financial in nature or\nincidental or complementary to activities that\nare financial in nature. \u201cFinancial in nature\u201d\nactivities include securities underwriting,\ndealing and market making; sponsoring mutual\nfunds and investment companies; insurance\nunderwriting and agency; merchant banking; and\nactivities that the Federal Reserve, in\nconsultation with the Secretary of the United\nStates Treasury, determines to be financial in\nnature or incidental to such financial\nactivity. \u201cComplementary activities\u201d are\nactivities that the Federal Reserve determines\nupon application to be complementary to a\nfinancial activity and that do not pose a\nsafety and soundness risk.\n\nThe Company generally is not required to\nobtain Federal Reserve approval to acquire a\ncompany engaged in activities that are\nfinancial in nature or incidental to\nactivities that are financial in nature, as\nlong as the Company meets the capital,\nmanagerial and CRA requirements to qualify as\nan FHC. However, the Company is required to\nreceive approval for an acquisition in which\nthe total consolidated assets to be acquired\nexceed $10 billion. FHCs are also required to\nobtain the approval of the Federal Reserve\nbefore they may acquire more than five percent\nof the voting shares or substantially all of\nthe assets of an unaffiliated BHC, bank or\nsavings association. In addition, banks must\nreceive approval before they may acquire,\nmerge with, acquire substantially all of the\nassets of or assume any deposits of a bank or\nsavings association and may be required to\nreceive approval for acquisitions of other\ncompanies.\n\nInterstate Banking A BHC may acquire banks in\nstates other than its home state, subject to\nany state requirement that the bank has been\norganized and operating for a minimum period\nof time (not to exceed five years). Also, such\nan acquisition is not permitted if the BHC\ncontrols, prior to or following the proposed\nacquisition, more than 10 percent of the total\namount of deposits of insured depository\ninstitutions nationwide or, if the acquisition\nis the BHC\u2019s initial entry into the state,\nmore than 30 percent of the deposits of\ninsured depository institutions in the state\n(or any lesser or greater amount set by the\nstate). Banks may merge across state lines to\ncreate interstate branches and are permitted\nto establish new branches in another state to\nthe same extent as banks chartered by that\nstate.\n\nRegulatory Approval for Acquisitions In\ndetermining whether to approve a proposed bank\nacquisition, federal bank regulators will\nconsider a number of factors, including the\neffect of the acquisition on competition,\nfinancial condition and future prospects\n(including current and projected capital\nratios and levels); the competence, experience\nand integrity of management and its record of\ncompliance with laws and regulations; the\nconvenience and needs of the communities to be\nserved (including the acquiring institution\u2019s\nrecord of compliance under the CRA); the\neffectiveness of the acquiring institution in\ncombating money laundering activities; and the\nextent to which the transaction would result\nin greater or more concentrated risks to the\nstability of the United States banking or\nfinancial system. In addition, approval of\ninterstate transactions requires that the\nacquiror satisfy regulatory standards for\nwell-capitalized and well-managed\ninstitutions.\n\nSource of Strength The Company is required to\nact as a source of strength to USBNA, and to\ncommit capital and financial resources to\nsupport USBNA in circumstances where the\nCompany might not otherwise do so. Under these\nrequirements, the Federal Reserve may in the\nfuture require the Company to provide\nfinancial assistance to USBNA, should it\nexperience financial distress. Capital loans\nby the Company to USBNA would be subordinate\nin right of payment to deposits and certain\nother debts of USBNA.\n\nOCC Heightened Standards USBNA is subject to\nthe OCC\u2019s guidelines establishing heightened\nstandards for large national banks, which\nestablish minimum standards for the design and\nimplementation of a risk governance framework\nfor banks. The OCC may take action against\ninstitutions that fail to meet these\nstandards.\n\nEnhanced Prudential Standards Under the Dodd-\nFrank Act, as modified by the Economic Growth,\nRegulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act\nand the Tailoring Rules, large bank holding\ncompanies, such as the Company, are subject to\ncertain enhanced prudential standards based on\nthe banking organization\u2019s size and certain\n\u201crisk-based indicators.\u201d The prudential\nstandards include enhanced risk-based capital\nand leverage requirements, enhanced liquidity\nrequirements, enhanced risk\n                      5                       \nmanagement and risk committee requirements, a\nrequirement to submit a resolution plan,\nsingle-counterparty credit limits and stress\ntests. Certain of the enhanced prudential\nstandards applicable to the Company are\ndescribed below in further detail.\n\nDividend Restrictions The Company is a legal\nentity separate and distinct from its\nsubsidiaries. Typically, the majority of the\nCompany\u2019s operating funds are received in the\nform of dividends paid to the Company by\nUSBNA. Federal law imposes limitations on the\npayment of dividends by national banks. In\ngeneral, dividends payable by USBNA and the\nCompany\u2019s trust bank subsidiaries, as national\nbanking associations, are limited by rules\nthat compare dividends to net income for\nperiods defined by regulation.\n\nThe OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC also\nhave authority to prohibit or limit the\npayment of dividends by the banking\norganizations they supervise (including the\nCompany and USBNA) if, in the banking\nregulator\u2019s opinion, payment of a dividend\nwould constitute an unsafe or unsound practice\nin light of the financial condition of the\nbanking organization.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve\u2019s final rule\nimplementing the stress capital buffer (\u201cSCB\u201d)\nprovides that a BHC must receive prior\napproval for any dividend, stock repurchase or\nother capital distribution, other than a\ncapital distribution on a newly issued capital\ninstrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit\nits capital plan. The rule also provides that\na BHC must resubmit its capital plan if, among\nother things, the BHC determines there has\nbeen or will be a material change in the BHC\u2019s\nrisk profile, financial condition, or\ncorporate structure since the BHC last\nsubmitted its capital plan.\n\nCapital Requirements The Company is subject to\ncertain regulatory risk-based capital and\nleverage requirements under capital rules\nadopted by the Federal Reserve, and USBNA is\nsubject to substantially similar rules adopted\nby the OCC. These rules implement the Basel\nCommittee\u2019s framework for strengthening the\nregulation, supervision and risk management of\nbanks (\u201cBasel III\u201d), as well as certain\nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. These\nquantitative calculations are minimums, and\nthe Federal Reserve and OCC may determine that\na banking organization, based on its size,\ncomplexity or risk profile, must maintain a\nhigher level of capital in order to operate in\na safe and sound manner.\n\nUnder the Tailoring Rules, the Company and\nUSBNA are each currently subject to \u201cCategory\nIII\u201d standards, and are \u201cstandardized\napproach\u201d banking organizations that are\nsubject to rules that provide for simplified\ncapital requirements relating to the threshold\ndeductions for mortgage servicing assets,\ndeferred tax assets arising from temporary\ndifferences that a banking organization could\nnot realize through net operating loss carry\nbacks, and investments in the capital of\nunconsolidated financial institutions, as well\nas the inclusion of minority interests in\nregulatory capital. Growth in total\nconsolidated assets (including assets obtained\nin acquisitions) or cross-jurisdictional\nactivity (as defined in the Tailoring Rules)\ncould affect the Company\u2019s continued\nclassification as a \u201cCategory III\u201d\ninstitution, which could result in the Company\nand its insured depository institution\nsubsidiary becoming \u201cadvanced approaches\u201d\nbanking organizations, a requirement to\nrecognize elements of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income in regulatory capital, as\nwell as other more stringent capital,\nliquidity, and other regulatory requirements.\n\nUnder the United States Basel III-based\ncapital rules, the Company is subject to a\nminimum common equity tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) capital\nratio (CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets)\nof 4.5 percent, a minimum tier 1 capital ratio\nof 6.0 percent and a minimum total capital\nratio of 8.0 percent. At December 31, 2024,\nthe Company exceeded these minimum capital\nratio requirements. The Company is also\nsubject to the SCB, which is based on the\nresults of the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory\nstress tests and the Company\u2019s planned common\nstock dividends, and, if deployed by the\nFederal Reserve, up to a 2.5 percent common\nequity tier 1 countercyclical capital buffer.\nThese additional requirements must be\nsatisfied entirely with capital that qualifies\nas CET1. Although the Federal Reserve has not\nto date raised the countercyclical capital\nbuffer above zero percent, the countercyclical\ncapital buffer could change in the future. The\nSCB generally is assigned on an annual basis\nand becomes effective on October 1 of each\nyear, subject to a 2.5 percent floor, and may\nvary over time. As of December 31, 2024, the\nSCB applicable to the Company is 3.1 percent,\nan increase from the SCB of 2.5 percent that\napplied to the Company at December 31, 2023.\nIf the Federal Reserve were to raise the\ncountercyclical capital buffer, or if the SCB\napplicable to the Company were to exceed 3.1\npercent, this would also change the effective\nminimum capital ratios to which the Company is\nsubject. For USBNA, the buffer requirement\nconsists of the static capital conservation\nbuffer equal to 2.5 percent of risk-weighted\nassets.\n\nBanking organizations that fail to meet the\neffective minimum ratios will be subject to\nconstraints on capital distributions,\nincluding dividends and share repurchases, and\ncertain discretionary executive compensation,\nwith the severity of the constraints depending\non the extent of the shortfall and \u201celigible\nretained income\u201d (defined as the greater of\n(i) net income for the four preceding\nquarters, net of distributions and associated\ntax effects not reflected in net income; and\n(ii) the average of all net income over the\npreceding four quarters).\n\nUnited States banking organizations are also\nsubject to a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of\n4.0 percent. As a Category III banking\norganization, the Company is also subject to a\nminimum Supplementary Leverage Ratio (\u201cSLR\u201d)\nof 3.0 percent that takes into account both\non-balance sheet and certain off-balance sheet\nexposures. At December 31, 2024, the Company\nexceeded the applicable minimum tier 1\nleverage ratio and SLR requirements.\n\nIn July 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory\nauthorities proposed a rule implementing the\nBasel Committee\u2019s finalization of the post-\ncrisis regulatory capital reforms, commonly\nreferred to as \u201cBasel III Endgame.\u201d The\nproposal would set stricter criteria for the\nuse of internal models by replacing the market\nrisk rule with the \u201cFundamental Review of the\nTrading Book,\u201d and would introduce new\nstandardized approaches for credit risk,\noperational risk and credit valuation\nadjustment risk, which would replace the\ncurrent models-based approaches. In addition,\nunder the proposed rule, also subject to a\nphase-in period, Category III banking\ninstitutions, such as the Company, would no\nlonger be permitted to opt out of including\ncertain components of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income in regulatory capital,\nwhich would result in unrealized gains and\nlosses on available-\n                      6                       \nfor-sale securities being included in the\ncalculation of the Company\u2019s regulatory\ncapital ratios. The Company continues to\nevaluate the potential effects of the proposed\nrule, and the effects on the Company will\ndepend on the final form of any rulemaking.\n\nIn 2020, the United States federal banking\nagencies adopted a rule that allowed banking\norganizations, including the Company and\nUSBNA, to elect to delay temporarily the\nestimated effects of adopting the current\nexpected credit loss accounting standard\n(\u201cCECL\u201d) on regulatory capital until January\n2022 and subsequently to phase in the effects\nthrough January 2025. Through the 2024 stress\ntest cycle, the Federal Reserve has not yet\nincorporated CECL into the calculation of the\nallowance for credit losses in supervisory\nstress tests, and the Federal Reserve issued\nguidance in October 2024 to indicate that it\nwill maintain the current framework for\nallowance for credit losses in the supervisory\nstress test through the 2025 stress test\ncycle. For further discussion of CECL, see\nNotes 1 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in the 2024 Annual\nReport. The Company and USBNA elected to delay\nand subsequently phase in the regulatory\ncapital impact of CECL in accordance with this\nrule.\n\nFor additional information regarding the\nCompany\u2019s regulatory capital, see \u201cCapital\nManagement\u201d in the 2024 Annual Report.\n\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review As\nrequired by the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(\u201cCCAR\u201d) rules, the Company submits a capital\nplan to the Federal Reserve on an annual\nbasis. As part of the CCAR process, the\nFederal Reserve evaluates the Company\u2019s plans\nto make capital distributions, including by\nrepurchasing stock or making dividend\npayments, under a number of macroeconomic and\nCompany-specific assumptions based on the\nCompany\u2019s and the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress\ntests described under \u201cStress Testing\u201d below.\nThese capital plans consist of a number of\nmandatory elements, including an assessment of\na company\u2019s sources and uses of capital over a\nnine-quarter planning horizon assuming both\nexpected and stressful conditions; a detailed\ndescription of a company\u2019s process for\nassessing capital adequacy; and a\ndemonstration of a company\u2019s ability to\nmaintain capital above each minimum regulatory\ncapital ratio (without taking the buffers into\naccount) under expected and stressful\nconditions.\n\nStress Testing The Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR\nframework and the Dodd-Frank Act stress\ntesting framework require BHCs subject to\nCategory III standards such as the Company to\nconduct an annual internal stress test in\nconnection with its annual capital plan\nsubmission as well as biennial company-run\nstress tests, and subject such BHCs to annual\nsupervisory stress tests conducted by the\nFederal Reserve. Among other things, the\ncompany-run stress tests employ stress\nscenarios developed by the Company as well as\nstress scenarios provided by the Federal\nReserve and incorporate the Dodd-Frank Act\ncapital actions (as opposed to the Company\u2019s\nplanned capital actions), which are intended\nto normalize capital distributions across\nlarge U.S. BHCs. The Federal Reserve conducts\nCCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress\ntests employing stress scenarios and internal\nsupervisory models and incorporates the\nCompany\u2019s planned capital actions and the\nDodd-Frank Act capital actions, respectively,\ninto its stress tests. The Federal Reserve and\nthe Company are currently required to publish\nthe results of the annual supervisory and\nbiennial company-run stress tests,\nrespectively, no later than June 30 of each\napplicable year. If the Company were to become\na \u201cCategory II\u201d institution for purposes of\nthe Tailoring Rules, the Company would become\nsubject to annual (rather than biennial)\ncompany-run stress tests.\n\nUnder the OCC\u2019s rules, national banks with\nassets in excess of $250 billion, including\nUSBNA, are required to submit company-run\nstress test results to the OCC concurrently\nwith their parent BHC\u2019s CCAR submission to the\nFederal Reserve. The stress test is based on\nthe OCC\u2019s stress scenarios (which are\ntypically the same as the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nstress scenarios) and capital actions that are\nappropriate for the economic conditions\nassumed in each scenario.\n\nBasel III Liquidity Requirements As Category\nIII banking organizations, the Company and\nUSBNA are each subject to a minimum liquidity\ncoverage ratio (\"LCR\") under the Tailoring\nRules. The LCR is designed to ensure that BHCs\nhave sufficient high-quality liquid assets to\nsurvive a significant liquidity stress event\nlasting for 30 calendar days. In addition, the\nCompany and USBNA are subject to the net\nstable funding ratio (\"NSFR\") rule, which is\ndesigned to promote stable, longer-term\nfunding of assets and business activities over\na one-year time horizon. Under the Tailoring\nRules and NSFR rule, the Company and USBNA, as\nCategory III banking organizations with less\nthan $75 billion of weighted short-term\nwholesale funding, qualify for reduced LCR and\nNSFR requirements calibrated at 85 percent of\nthe full requirements. If the Company were to\nbecome a \u201cCategory II\u201d institution for\npurposes of the Tailoring Rules, the Company\nwould become subject to the full (100 percent)\nLCR and NSFR requirements, as well as daily\n(rather than monthly) liquidity reporting\nrequirements.\n\nPrompt Corrective Action The Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation Improvement Act\n(\u201cFDICIA\u201d) provides a framework for regulation\nof depository institutions and their\naffiliates (including parent holding\ncompanies) by federal banking regulators. As\npart of that framework, the FDICIA requires\nthe relevant federal banking regulator to take\n\u201cprompt corrective action\u201d with respect to an\nFDIC-insured depository institution, such as\nUSBNA, if that institution does not meet\ncertain capital adequacy standards.\nSupervisory actions by the appropriate federal\nbanking regulator under the \u201cprompt corrective\naction\u201d rules generally depend upon an\ninstitution\u2019s classification within five\ncapital categories. An institution that fails\nto remain well-capitalized becomes subject to\na series of restrictions that increase in\nseverity as its capital condition weakens.\nSuch restrictions may include a prohibition on\ncapital distributions, restrictions on asset\ngrowth or restrictions on the ability to\nreceive regulatory approval of applications.\nThe FDICIA also provides for enhanced\nsupervisory authority over undercapitalized\ninstitutions, including authority for the\nappointment of a conservator or receiver for\nthe institution.\n                      7                       \nPrompt corrective action regulations apply\nonly to banks and not to BHCs such as the\nCompany. However, the Federal Reserve is\nauthorized to take appropriate action at the\nBHC level, based on the undercapitalized\nstatus of the BHC\u2019s subsidiary banking\ninstitutions. In certain instances, relating\nto an undercapitalized bank, the BHC would be\nrequired to guarantee the performance of the\nundercapitalized subsidiary\u2019s capital\nrestoration plan and could be liable for civil\nmoney damages for failure to fulfill those\nguarantee commitments.\n\nLong-Term Debt Requirements In August 2023,\nthe Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC issued a\nproposed rule that would require, among other\ninstitutions, each Category III U.S. BHC,\nincluding the Company, and each insured\ndepository institution with $100 billion or\nmore in total consolidated assets that is a\nconsolidated subsidiary of a Category III U.S.\nBHC, such as USBNA, to have minimum levels of\noutstanding long-term debt. The proposed rule\nis intended to improve the resolvability of\nthe banking organizations covered by the rule.\nUnder the proposed rule, covered banking\norganizations would be required to maintain\nlong-term debt in an amount that is equal to\nthe greater of (i) 6% of the organization\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets; (ii) 3.5% of the\norganization\u2019s average total consolidated\nassets; and (iii) 2.5% of the organization\u2019s\ntotal leverage exposure, if the organization\nis subject to the SLR rule. The requirement\nwould be phased in over three years, with\ncovered banking organizations being required\nto meet 25% of the requirement within one year\nafter finalization of the rule, 50% after two\nyears and 100% after three years. The agencies\nhave not yet issued a final rule. Any effects\non the Company and USBNA will depend on the\nfinal form of any rulemaking.\n\nDeposit Insurance The DIF provides insurance\ncoverage for certain deposits, up to a\nstandard maximum deposit insurance amount of\n$250,000 per depositor. Deposits at USBNA are\ninsured up to the applicable limits. The DIF\nis funded through assessments on insured\ndepository institutions, including USBNA,\nbased on the risk each institution poses to\nthe DIF. The FDIC may increase USBNA\u2019s\ninsurance premiums based on various factors,\nincluding the FDIC\u2019s assessment of its risk\nprofile.\n\nIn addition, large insured depository\ninstitutions, including USBNA, are subject to\nenhanced deposit account recordkeeping and\nrelated information technology system\nrequirements meant to facilitate prompt\npayment of insured deposits if such an\ninstitution were to fail.\n\nIn October 2022, the FDIC finalized a rule to\nincrease the initial base deposit insurance\nassessment rate schedules for all insured\ndepository institutions by two basis points,\nbeginning with the first quarterly assessment\nperiod of 2023. The increased assessment rate\nis intended to improve the likelihood that the\nDIF reserve ratio would reach the required\nminimum of 1.35 percent by the statutory\ndeadline of September 30, 2028.\n\nIn November 2023, the FDIC released a final\nrule to impose a special assessment to recover\nthe losses to the DIF resulting from failures\nof other banking institutions during 2023. The\nspecial assessments are tax deductible. As a\nresult of this rule, the Company recognized\nadditional noninterest expense of $136 million\nand $734 million in 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, for the FDIC special assessment.\n\nDepositor Preference Under federal law, in the\nevent of the liquidation or other resolution\nof an insured depository institution, the\nclaims of a receiver of the institution for\nadministrative expense and the claims of\nholders of domestic deposit liabilities have\npriority over the claims of other unsecured\ncreditors of the institution, including\nholders of publicly issued senior or\nsubordinated debt and depositors in non-\ndomestic offices. As a result, those\ndebtholders and depositors would be treated\ndifferently from, and could receive, if\nanything, substantially less than, the\ndepositors in domestic offices of the\ndepository institution.\n\nOrderly Liquidation Authority Upon the\ninsolvency of a BHC, such as the Company, the\nFDIC may be appointed as conservator or\nreceiver of the BHC if the Secretary of the\nTreasury determines (upon the written\nrecommendation of the FDIC and the Federal\nReserve and after consultation with the\nPresident of the United States) that certain\nconditions set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act\nregarding the potential impact on financial\nstability of a financial company\u2019s failure\nhave been met. FDIC rules set forth a\ncomprehensive method for the receivership of a\ncovered financial company. Acting as a\nconservator or receiver, the FDIC would have\nbroad powers to transfer any assets or\nliabilities of a BHC without the approval of\nits creditors.\n\nResolution Plans The Company is required by\nthe Federal Reserve and the FDIC to submit a\nperiodic plan for the rapid and orderly\nresolution of the Company and its significant\nlegal entities in the event of future material\nfinancial distress or failure. If the Federal\nReserve and the FDIC jointly determine that\nthe resolution plan is not credible and such\ndeficiencies are not cured in a timely manner,\nthe regulators may jointly impose on the\nCompany more stringent capital, leverage or\nliquidity requirements or restrictions on the\nCompany\u2019s growth, activities or operations. If\nthe Company were to fail to address the\ndeficiencies in its resolution plan when\nrequired, it could eventually be required to\ndivest certain assets or operations. As a\nCategory III banking organization, the Company\nis required to submit resolution plans on a\ntriennial cycle (alternating between targeted\nand full submissions). The Company was\nscheduled to file its next full resolution\nplan in July 2024, but the FDIC and Federal\nReserve extended the submission deadlines for\nall triennial full filers, including the\nCompany, from July 2024 to October 2025.\n\nIn August 2024, the Federal Reserve and the\nFDIC finalized guidance for 2025 and\nsubsequent resolution plan submissions that\nwould apply to certain institutions including\nCategory III institutions such as the Company.\nThe guidance addresses the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nand FDIC\u2019s expectations regarding key areas of\nresolution, including capital, liquidity,\noperational, legal entity rationalization, and\ninsured depository institution resolution,\nbased on a firm\u2019s resolution strategy.\n\nUSBNA is also required to file periodically\nseparate resolution plans with the FDIC that\nshould enable the FDIC, as receiver, to\nresolve USBNA under applicable receivership\nprovisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nAct in a manner that ensures that depositors\nreceive access to their insured deposits\nwithin one business day of the institution\u2019s\nfailure, maximizes the net present\n                      8                       \nvalue return from the sale or disposition of\nits assets and minimizes the amount of any\nloss to the institution\u2019s creditors. In June\n2024, the FDIC finalized revisions to its\nresolution planning rule that, among other\nthings, requires periodic testing to validate\nkey resolution capabilities and sets out the\ncriteria and process for the FDIC\u2019s review of\nthe credibility of resolution plans. Under the\nrevised rule, USBNA is required to submit\ntriennial resolution plans and annual interim\nsupplements in years in which a full\nresolution plan is not filed, which update\ncertain information provided in the full\nresolution plan. USBNA is required to file its\nnext initial interim supplement on or before\nJuly 1, 2025, and its next full resolution\nplan on or before July 1, 2026.\n\nRecovery Plans The OCC has established\nenforceable guidelines for recovery planning\nby insured national banks with average total\nconsolidated assets of $250 billion or more,\nincluding USBNA. The guidelines provide that a\ncovered bank should develop and maintain a\nrecovery plan that is appropriate for its\nindividual risk profile, size, activities, and\ncomplexity, including the complexity of its\norganizational and legal entity structure. The\nguidelines state that a recovery plan should,\namong other elements, (i) establish triggers,\nwhich are quantitative or qualitative\nindicators of the risk or existence of severe\nstress that should always be escalated to\nmanagement or the board of directors, as\nappropriate, for purposes of initiating a\nresponse; (ii) identify a wide range of\ncredible options that a covered bank could\nundertake to restore financial and operational\nstrength and viability; (iii) include impact\nassessments for each such recovery option, and\n(iv) address escalation procedures, management\nreports, and communication procedures. USBNA\u2019s\nmost recent recovery plan was reviewed and\napproved pursuant to these guidelines in\nDecember 2024. In October 2024, the OCC\nfinalized revisions to these guidelines that\nincorporate a testing standard and clarify the\nrole of non-financial risk in recovery\nplanning. These revisions are applicable to\nUSBNA\u2019s next recovery plan submission.\n\nTransactions with Affiliates There are various\nlegal restrictions on the extent to which the\nCompany and its non-bank subsidiaries may\nborrow or otherwise engage in certain types of\ntransactions with USBNA or its subsidiaries.\nUnder the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal\nReserve\u2019s Regulation W, USBNA and its\nsubsidiaries are subject to quantitative and\nqualitative limits on extensions of credit\n(including credit exposure arising from\nrepurchase and reverse repurchase agreements,\nsecurities borrowing and derivative\ntransactions), purchases of assets, and\ncertain other transactions with the Company or\nits other non-bank subsidiaries and\naffiliates. Additionally, transactions between\nUSBNA or its subsidiaries, on the one hand,\nand the Company or its other non-bank\nsubsidiaries and affiliates, on the other\nhand, are required to be on arm\u2019s length\nterms. Transactions between USBNA and its\naffiliates and the Company and its other non-\nbank subsidiaries and its affiliates must be\nconsistent with standards of safety and\nsoundness.\n\nAnti-Money Laundering and Sanctions The\nCompany is subject to several federal laws\nthat are designed to combat money laundering\nand terrorist financing, and to restrict\ntransactions with persons, companies, or\nforeign governments sanctioned by United\nStates authorities. This category of laws\nincludes the Bank Secrecy Act (the \u201cBSA\u201d), the\nMoney Laundering Control Act, the USA PATRIOT\nAct (collectively, \u201cAML laws\u201d), and\nimplementing regulations for the International\nEmergency Economic Powers Act and the Trading\nwith the Enemy Act, as administered by the\nU.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of\nForeign Assets Control (\u201csanctions laws\u201d).\n\nAs implemented by federal banking and\nsecurities regulators and the U.S. Department\nof the Treasury, AML laws obligate depository\ninstitutions and broker-dealers to verify\ntheir customers\u2019 identity, verify the identity\nof beneficial owners of legal entity\ncustomers, conduct customer due diligence,\nreport on suspicious activity, file reports of\ncertain transactions in currency, and conduct\nenhanced due diligence on certain accounts.\nSanctions laws prohibit United States persons\nand certain foreign affiliates from engaging\nin any transaction with a restricted person or\nrestricted country. Depository institutions\nand broker-dealers are required by their\nrespective federal regulators to maintain\npolicies and procedures in order to ensure\ncompliance with the above obligations. Federal\nregulators regularly examine BSA/Anti-Money\nLaundering (\u201cAML\u201d) and sanctions compliance\nprograms to ensure their adequacy and\neffectiveness, and the frequency and extent of\nsuch examinations and related remedial actions\nhave been increasing.\n\nIn January 2021, the Anti-Money Laundering Act\nof 2020 (\u201cAMLA\u201d), which amends the BSA, was\nenacted. Among other things, the AMLA codified\na risk-based approach to anti-money laundering\ncompliance for financial institutions;\nrequired the development of standards by the\nU.S. Department of the Treasury for evaluating\ntechnology and internal processes for BSA\ncompliance; and expanded enforcement- and\ninvestigation-related authority, including a\nsignificant expansion in the available\nsanctions for certain BSA violations. Many of\nthe statutory provisions in the AMLA require\nadditional rulemakings, reports and other\nmeasures, and the impact of the AMLA will\ndepend on, among other things, rulemaking and\nimplementation guidance. In June 2021, the\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau\nof the U.S. Department of the Treasury\n(\u201cFinCEN\u201d), issued the priorities for anti-\nmoney laundering and countering the financing\nof terrorism policy required under the AMLA.\nThe priorities include corruption, cybercrime,\nterrorist financing, fraud, transnational\ncrime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and\nproliferation financing. In July 2024, the\nOCC, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the\nNational Credit Union Administration issued a\njoint proposed rule that would amend their\nrules regarding AML programs. Among other\nthings, the proposed rule would require\nnational banks, such as USBNA, to incorporate\na risk assessment process into their AML\nprograms that consider the priorities\npublished by FinCEN and would encourage, but\nnot require, banks to consider, evaluate and\nimplement innovative approaches to meet BSA\ncompliance obligations. The effects of the\nproposed rule on USBNA will depend on the\nfinal form of any rulemaking.\n\nCommunity Reinvestment Act USBNA is subject to\nthe provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of\nthe CRA, banks have a continuing and\naffirmative obligation, consistent with safe\nand sound operation, to help meet the credit\nneeds of their communities, including\nproviding credit to individuals residing in\nlow- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The\nOCC assesses\n                      9                       \nUSBNA on its record in meeting the credit\nneeds of the community served by USBNA,\nincluding low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods. CRA assessments also are\nconsidered by the Federal Reserve or OCC when\nreviewing applications by banking institutions\nto acquire, merge or consolidate with another\nbanking institution or its holding company, to\nestablish a new branch office that will accept\ndeposits, or to relocate an office. In the\ncase of a BHC applying for approval to acquire\na bank or other BHC, the Federal Reserve will\nassess the CRA records of each subsidiary\ndepository institution of the applicant BHC,\nand those records may be the basis for denying\nthe application. USBNA received an\n\u201cOutstanding\u201d CRA rating in its most recent\nexamination, covering the period from January\n1, 2016 through December 31, 2020.\n\nIn October 2023, the OCC, together with the\nFederal Reserve and FDIC, issued a final rule\nto modernize the CRA regulatory framework. The\nfinal rule is intended, among other things, to\nstrengthen the achievement of the core purpose\nof the CRA, to adapt to changes in the banking\nindustry, including the expanded role of\nmobile and online banking, and to tailor\nperformance standards to account for\ndifferences in bank size and business models.\nThe final rule tracks the proposed rule issued\nby the agencies in May 2022 and adjusts CRA\nevaluations based on bank size and type, with\nmany of the changes applying only to banks\nwith over $2 billion in assets and several\napplying only to banks with over $10 billion\nin assets, such as USBNA. The final rule\nintroduces major changes to the CRA regulatory\nframework, including: (i) the delineation of\nassessment areas outside a bank\u2019s traditional\nphysical footprint; (ii) the overall\nevaluation framework and performance standards\nand metrics; (iii) the definition of community\ndevelopment activities; and (iv) data\ncollection and reporting. The final rule\nbecame effective on April 1, 2024, but has\nbeen paused subject to a court ordered\ninjunction, and most provisions of the rule\nwill not become applicable until after January\n1, 2026, pending the outcome of litigation on\nthe final rule. The Company continues to\nevaluate the effect of the final rule on\nUSBNA, and any effects may depend on further\nguidance from the regulators with respect to\ninterpretive and implementation-related issues\nthat may arise.\n\nRegulation of Brokerage, Investment Advisory\nand Insurance Activities The Company conducts\na broad range of securities activities, both\nretail and institutional, in the United States\nthrough U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. and\nU.S. Bancorp Advisors, LLC (collectively,\n\u201cbroker-dealer entities\u201d). These activities\nare subject to regulations of the SEC, the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority and\nother authorities, including state regulators.\nThese regulations generally cover licensing of\nsecurities personnel, interactions with\ncustomers and counterparties, trading\noperations, securities underwriting\ncompensation and arrangements, customer\nsuitability, recordkeeping, reporting and\ncommunications. Securities regulators impose\ncapital requirements on the Company\u2019s broker-\ndealer entities and conduct audits or other\nperiodic reviews of their sales practice and\nfinancial operations. In addition, the\nCompany\u2019s broker-dealer entities are members\nof the Securities Investor Protection\nCorporation, which oversees the liquidation of\nmember broker-dealers that close when the\nbroker-dealer is bankrupt or in financial\ndistress and imposes membership fee\nassessments and other reporting requirements\non the broker-dealer entities.\n\nThe operations of the First American family of\nfunds, the Company\u2019s proprietary money market\nfund complex, also are subject to regulation\nby the SEC, including rules requiring a\nfloating net asset value for institutional\nprime and tax-free money market funds and\npermitting the board of directors of the money\nmarket funds the ability to limit redemptions\nduring periods of stress (allowing for the use\nof liquidity fees and redemption gates during\nsuch times). In July 2023, the SEC finalized\namendments to the rules that govern money\nmarket funds. These amendments, among other\nthings, increased liquidity requirements for\nmoney market funds by requiring funds to hold\ngreater proportions of their total assets in\nsecurities that can be liquidated in one\nbusiness day, and require institutional prime\nand institutional tax-exempt money market\nfunds to impose liquidity fees on investors\nthat redeem their investments during times of\nstress.\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations in the areas of\ninsurance brokerage and reinsurance of credit\nlife insurance are subject to regulation and\nsupervision by various state insurance\nregulatory authorities, including the\nlicensing of insurance brokers and agents.\n\nRegulation of Derivatives and the Swaps\nMarketplace Under the Dodd-Frank Act, USBNA,\nas a CFTC registered swap dealer, is subject\nto rules regarding the regulation of the swaps\nmarketplace and over-the-counter derivatives,\nincluding rules that require swap dealers and\nmajor swap participants to register with the\nCFTC, to meet certain business conduct,\ndocument, risk management, recordkeeping,\nreporting, and segregation requirements, and\nto centrally clear and trade swaps on\nregulated exchanges or execution facilities.\nCFTC rules also require USBNA to be a member\nof the National Futures Association, a self-\nregulatory organization with authority over\nswap dealers, and to comply with the rules of\napplicable exchanges and clearinghouses.\n\nIn addition, the OCC\u2019s rules concerning swap\nmargin and capital requirements for swap\ndealers regulated by the OCC mandate the\nexchange of initial and variation margin for\nnon-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-\nbased swaps between swap entities regulated by\nfive federal agencies and certain\ncounterparties. The amount of margin will vary\nbased on the relative risk of the non-cleared\nswap or non-cleared security-based swap. Other\nrules generally exempt inter-affiliate\ntransactions from initial margin requirements\nto the extent a depository institution\u2019s total\nexposure to all affiliates is less than 15\npercent of its tier 1 capital.\n\nThe Volcker Rule Section 13 of the BHC Act and\nits implementing regulations, commonly\nreferred to as the \u201cVolcker Rule,\u201d prohibit\nbanking entities from engaging in proprietary\ntrading, and prohibit certain interests in, or\nrelationships with, hedge funds or private\nequity funds. The Volcker Rule applies to the\nCompany, USBNA and their affiliates, and\ncompliance requirements are tailored based on\nthe size and scope of trading activities. The\nCompany has a Volcker Rule compliance program\nin place that covers all of its subsidiaries\nand affiliates, including USBNA.\n                      10                      \nPrivacy and Data Protection Federal and state\nlaws contain extensive consumer privacy and\ndata protection provisions. The Gramm Leach-\nBliley Act (\u201cGLBA\u201d) requires financial\ninstitutions to periodically disclose their\nprivacy policies and practices relating to\nsharing nonpublic personal information (\u201cNPI\u201d)\nand enables retail customers to opt out of the\nsharing of such information with nonaffiliated\nthird parties under certain circumstances.\nOther federal and state laws and regulations\nimpact the Company\u2019s ability to share certain\ninformation with affiliates and non-affiliates\nfor marketing and/or non-marketing purposes,\nor to contact customers with marketing offers.\nThe GLBA also requires financial institutions\nto implement a comprehensive information\nsecurity program. Security and privacy\npolicies and procedures for the protection of\npersonal and confidential information are in\neffect across all the Company\u2019s businesses and\ngeographic locations.\n\nData privacy and data protection are areas of\nincreasing legislative focus in the United\nStates, and several U.S. states have enacted\ncomprehensive consumer privacy laws that\nimpose compliance obligations with respect to\npersonal information. The Company has made and\nwill make operational adjustments in\naccordance with the requirements of applicable\nprivacy and data protection laws. For example,\nthe Company is subject to the California\nConsumer Protection Act of 2018 and its\nimplementing regulations, as amended in 2020\nby the California Privacy Rights Act (the\n\"CCPA\"), which provided residents of\nCalifornia with specific rights with respect\nto the collection of their personal\ninformation. The CCPA exempts NPI from its\nscope. The process of drafting and finalizing\nimplementing regulations for the CCPA is\nongoing. The Company continues to evaluate the\nnew regulations, and the effects on the\nCompany will depend on the form of any\nadditional rulemakings.\n\nSimilar comprehensive consumer privacy laws\nhave been adopted by other states where the\nCompany does business. Each of these state\nlaws, however, includes an entity level\nexemption for \u201cfinancial institutions\u201d that\nare subject to the GLBA like the Company. The\nUnited States Congress has also proposed\nlegislation relating to data privacy and data\nprotection, and the federal government may in\nthe future pass such legislation.\n\nIn addition, in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d),\nprivacy law is governed by the General Data\nProtection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which is\ndirectly binding and applicable in each EU\nmember state. The GDPR contains enhanced\ncompliance obligations and increased penalties\nfor non-compliance and is regularly enforced\nby European regulators. Canada is in the\nprocess of replacing its federal privacy law,\nthe Personal Information Protection and\nElectronic Documents Act, with a new privacy\nframework that the Company expects will impose\nadditional compliance obligations on the\nCompany\u2019s Canadian operations.\n\nIn October 2024, the CFPB finalized a rule\nregarding personal financial data rights,\nwhich applies to financial institutions that\ncontrol or possess data relating to covered\nconsumer financial products or services, such\nas Regulation E accounts and credit card\nissuers. Under the final rule, USBNA will be\nrequired to provide consumers and, upon the\nconsumer\u2019s request, their authorized third\nparties electronic access to \u201ccovered data.\u201d\nThis includes transaction information, account\nbalances, upcoming bill information,\ninformation to initiate payment to and from\naccounts, the terms and conditions under which\nan account or credit card was provided, and\ncertain other basic account verification\ninformation. The final rule, which is being\nchallenged by several banking industry groups,\nrequires \u201cdata providers\u201d such as USBNA to\ncreate detailed access interfaces for both\nconsumers and developers in order to\neffectuate consumers\u2019 access to, and transfer\nof, their personal financial data. USBNA will\nbe prohibited from imposing any fees or\ncharges for maintaining or providing access to\nor facilitating the transfer of such data.\nUnless the rule is overturned or rescinded,\nUSBNA must comply with the final rule by April\n1, 2026.\n\nLike other lenders, USBNA and other\nsubsidiaries of the Company use consumer\nreports in their underwriting activities. Use\nof such information is regulated under the\nFair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d), and the\nFCRA also regulates reporting information to\nconsumer reporting agencies, prescreening\nindividuals for credit offers, sharing of\nconsumer reports between affiliates, and using\naffiliate credit data for marketing purposes.\nSimilar state laws may impose additional\nrequirements on the Company and its\nsubsidiaries. In January 2025, the CFPB\npublished a final FCRA-related rule that\nprohibits the inclusion of medical debts in\nconsumer reports and prohibits a creditor\u2019s\nuse of medical debt to determine credit\neligibility, absent a specific exception.\nThere are currently two lawsuits filed against\nthe CFPB disputing the validity of the final\nrule and a preliminary injunction has been\ngranted by the court. Consequently, the\neffective date of the final rule has been\nstayed until June 15, 2025. In addition, a\nnotice of proposed rulemaking to revise the\nFCRA was also published in December 2024, with\ncomments to the proposal due in March 2025.\n\nThe federal banking regulators, as well as the\nSEC, CFPB, CFTC, and related self-regulatory\norganizations, regularly issue guidance on\ncybersecurity that is intended to enhance\ncyber risk management among financial\ninstitutions and provide timely information to\ninvestors. A financial institution\u2019s\nmanagement is required to maintain sufficient\nbusiness continuity planning processes to\nensure the rapid recovery, resumption and\nmaintenance of the institution\u2019s operations\nafter a cybersecurity incident. A financial\ninstitution is also expected to develop\nappropriate processes to enable recovery of\ndata and business operations if the\ninstitution or its critical service providers\nexperience a cybersecurity incident.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject\nto increasing numbers of regulatory\nnotification and disclosure requirements\nrelated to cybersecurity. As of April 2022,\nbanking organizations, such as the Company and\nUSBNA, are required to notify their primary\nfederal regulator within 36 hours of a\ncomputer-security incident that results in\nactual harm to the confidentiality, integrity,\nor availability of an information system or\nthe information that the system processes,\nstores or transmits, which has materially\ndisrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely\nto materially disrupt or degrade, the banking\norganization\u2019s ability to deliver services to\na material portion of its customer base,\njeopardize the viability of key operations of\nthe banking organization, or impact the\nstability of the financial sector. Similarly,\nthe Office of the Superintendent of Financial\nInstitutions in Canada requires Federally\nRegulated Financial Institutions to report\nqualifying technology and cybersecurity\nincidents under the provisions of the August\n13, 2021 Technology and Cyber Security\nIncident Reporting Advisory.\n                      11                      \nConsumer Protection USBNA\u2019s retail banking\nactivities are subject to a variety of federal\nand state statutes and regulations designed to\nprotect consumers. These laws and regulations\nrequire, among other things, disclosures of\nthe cost of credit and terms of deposit\naccounts, provide substantive consumer rights,\nprohibit discrimination in credit\ntransactions, regulate the use of credit\nreport information, provide financial privacy\nprotections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and\nabusive practices and subject USBNA to\nsubstantial regulatory oversight. Violations\nof applicable consumer protection laws can\nresult in significant potential liability from\nlitigation brought by customers, including\nactual damages, restitution and attorneys\u2019\nfees, and may also result in significant\nreputational harm. USBNA\u2019s regulators may also\nseek to enforce consumer protection\nrequirements and obtain these and other\nremedies, including regulatory sanctions and\ncivil money penalties.\n\nUSBNA and its subsidiaries are subject to\nsupervision and regulation by the CFPB with\nrespect to federal consumer laws. The CFPB has\nundertaken numerous rule-making and other\ninitiatives, including launching an initiative\nto reduce the amounts and types of fees\nfinancial institutions may charge, including\nby recently proposing a rule that would\nsignificantly reduce the permissible amount of\ncredit card late fees, issuing informal\nguidance and taking enforcement actions\nagainst certain financial institutions. The\nCFPB\u2019s rulemaking, examination and enforcement\nauthority has affected and will continue to\naffect financial institutions that provide\nconsumer financial products and services,\nincluding the Company, USBNA and the Company\u2019s\nother subsidiaries. These regulatory\nactivities may limit the types of financial\nservices and products the Company may offer,\nwhich in turn may reduce the Company\u2019s\nrevenues.\n\nExecutive and Incentive Compensation\nGuidelines adopted by the federal banking\nagencies prohibit excessive compensation as an\nunsafe and unsound practice and describe\ncompensation as \u201cexcessive\u201d when the amounts\npaid are unreasonable or disproportionate to\nthe services performed by an executive\nofficer, employee, director or principal\nstockholder. The Federal Reserve has issued\ncomprehensive guidance on incentive\ncompensation policies (the \u201cIncentive\nCompensation Guidance\u201d) intended to ensure\nthat the incentive compensation policies of\nbanking organizations do not undermine safety\nand soundness by encouraging excessive risk-\ntaking. The Incentive Compensation Guidance is\nbased upon the key principles that a banking\norganization\u2019s incentive compensation\narrangements should (i) provide incentives\nthat do not encourage risk-taking beyond the\norganization\u2019s ability to effectively identify\nand manage risks; (ii) be compatible with\neffective internal controls and risk\nmanagement; and (iii) be supported by strong\ncorporate governance, including active and\neffective oversight by the organization\u2019s\nboard of directors. The Incentive Compensation\nGuidance states that enforcement actions may\nbe taken against a banking organization if its\nincentive compensation arrangements or related\nrisk-management control or governance\nprocesses pose a risk to the organization\u2019s\nsafety and soundness and the organization is\nnot taking prompt and effective measures to\ncorrect the deficiencies.\n\nDuring 2016, the federal bank regulatory\nagencies and the SEC proposed revised rules on\nincentive-based payment arrangements at\nspecified regulated entities having at least\n$1 billion of total assets. In July 2024, the\nOCC, FDIC, Federal Housing Finance Agency and\nNational Credit Union Administration jointly\nre-proposed the regulatory text of the 2016\nproposal. The Federal Reserve and the SEC did\nnot join the proposal, and the proposed rule\nwill not be published in the Federal Register\nuntil the agencies have joined.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance In recent\nyears, federal, state and international\nlawmakers and regulators have increased their\nfocus on financial institutions\u2019 and other\ncompanies\u2019 risk oversight, disclosures and\npractices in connection with climate change\nand other environmental, social and governance\nmatters. In October 2023, the United States\nfederal banking agencies issued a set of\nprinciples relating to the management of\nclimate-related financial risks. The\nprinciples apply to banking organizations with\nover $100 billion in total consolidated\nassets, including the Company and USBNA. The\nprinciples are intended to provide a framework\nfor large banking organizations to guide their\nefforts to identify, measure, monitor, and\nmitigate physical and transition risks\nassociated with climate change. Among other\nguidance, the principles describe how climate-\nrelated financial risks can be addressed in\nconnection with specific risk categories,\nincluding credit risk, liquidity risk,\noperational risk, and legal and compliance\nrisk. In March 2024, the SEC adopted final\nrules related to the disclosure of climate-\nrelated financial risk, but such rules have\nbeen stayed pending the completion of judicial\nreview of the petitions challenging the rules,\nand on February 11, 2025, the SEC requested a\npause of the litigation, citing concerns with\nthe legality of the rules. Further, several\nstates in which the Company operates have\nenacted or proposed statutes, regulations or\nguidance addressing climate change and other\nsustainability issues. For example, in 2023,\nthe State of California enacted laws, which\nare subject to ongoing litigation, requiring\ncertain companies doing business in California\nto disclose greenhouse gas emissions data and\ncertain other climate-related information. In\naddition, the European Union\u2019s Corporate\nSustainability Reporting Directive came into\neffect in January 2023, significantly\nexpanding the scope of sustainability\ndisclosures required to be disclosed by\ncertain EU and non-EU companies.\n\nConversely, some states in which the Company\ndoes business have enacted, or proposed to\nenact, certain \u201canti-ESG\u201d measures, including\nstatutes, regulations or policies that\nprohibit certain financial institutions from\ndenying or canceling products or services to a\nperson, or otherwise discriminating against a\nperson in making available products or\nservices, on the basis of social credit scores\nand certain other factors. Similarly, the\ncurrent Presidential administration has issued\na number of executive orders and various\nagencies have taken positions that relate to\nenvironmental and social matters. Some of\nthese measures may conflict with other\nregulatory requirements, including those\ndescribed above. Due to legal challenges and\nother uncertainties, the effects of these\nmeasures on the Company cannot be predicted at\nthis time.\n\nOther Supervision and Regulation As a public\ncompany, the Company is subject to the\nrequirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and the rules\nand regulations promulgated\n                      12                      \nby the SEC thereunder, as administered by the\nSEC.

The Board oversees\nmanagement\u2019s performance relative to the risk\nmanagement framework and risk appetite.\nManagement is responsible for defining the\nvarious risks facing the Company, formulating\nrisk management policies and procedures, and\nmanaging risk exposures on a day-to-day basis.\nThe Company\u2019s Executive Risk Committee (ERC),\nwhich is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer,\noversees execution of the risk management\nframework. The ERC is supported by\nmanagement\u2019s senior operating committees, each\nresponsible for a specified risk category. The\nCompany\u2019s Information Security Risk Committee\n(ISRC), which is co-chaired by the Chief\nInformation Security Officer (CISO) and the\nChief Technology Risk Officer, is a senior\noperating committee under this risk governance\nstructure and is responsible for the\nmanagement of information security risk at the\nCompany. The ISRC provides direction and\noversight of the information security risk\nmanagement framework and corporate control\nprograms of the Company, including significant\ninformation security risk events, and\nmitigation strategies. Further, the ISRC\nfacilitates communication across business\nlines to provide for effective and consistent\ninformation security risk identification and\ncontrol infrastructure to mitigate and manage\nmaterial information security risks. The ISRC\nserves as an escalation, decision making, and\napproval body for information security risk\nitems, including key policies and programs,\nissue resolution, emerging risks, and key\nprogram adherence. The ISRC escalates matters\nas appropriate to executive management, the\nERC, which reports to the Board\u2019s Risk\nManagement Committee, or a relevant committee\nof the Board. Generally, each of the ERC and\nISRC meet at least monthly.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s risk management\nframework, risk management programs and\nprocesses are in place to incorporate risk\nconsiderations into day-to-day business\nactivities across the Company\u2019s risk\ncategories, business lines, and functions.\nRisk programs may manage all or certain\ncomponents of a particular risk type. The\nCompany\u2019s cybersecurity risk program provides\ncentralized planning and management of related\nand interdependent work with a focus on risks\nfrom cybersecurity threats. Additionally, the\nCompany\u2019s Information Security Awareness and\nTraining Program educates employees and\ncontractors on information security policies,\nstandards, and practices to protect U.S.\nBancorp\u2019s information, information systems,\nand processes. The Company\u2019s cybersecurity\nrisk program is integrated into the Company\u2019s\noverall business and operational strategies\nand requires that the Company allocate\nappropriate resources to maintain the program.\nThe Company\u2019s processes for assessing,\nidentifying, and managing material risks from\ncybersecurity threats are integrated into the\nCompany\u2019s overall risk governance and\noversight structures through its \u201cthree lines\nof defense\u201d model for establishing effective\nchecks and balances within the risk management\nframework.In this model, specific to\ncybersecurity threats, the first line of\ndefense is Information Security Services\n(ISS), which is responsible for identifying\nand implementing cybersecurity controls in\naccordance with policy requirements and\nindustry best practices, to meet regulatory\nrequirements and to safeguard the business.\nThe second line of defense, Cybersecurity Risk\nOversight within the Company's Operational\nRisk Management group, provides reporting and\nescalation of emerging risks related to\ncybersecurity and other concerns to senior\nmanagement, the ERC, the ISRC, other\ndesignated senior operating committees, and\nthe Risk Management Committee of the Board of\nDirectors. The third line of defense, the\nCompany\u2019s internal audit function, provides\nindependent assessment and assurance regarding\nthe effectiveness of the Company\u2019s governance,\nrisk management, and control processes with\nrespect to cybersecurity threats, and provides\nchallenges and recommendations for\nimprovement.\nThe Company uses reporting and metrics\nframeworks and regular internal and external\noversight to assess the health of the\ncybersecurity risk program. At the first\nlevel, the ISS team identifies, assesses, and\nmanages cybersecurity risk and threats. The\nCompany manages cybersecurity issues and\nfindings through remediation and/or closure,\nwith escalation processes if an issue or\nfinding cannot be remediated within required\ntimeframes. The Company engages external\nassessors, consultants, and auditors to review\nthe Company\u2019s cybersecurity risk program\nagainst those of industry peers. The Company\nalso uses consultants periodically to provide\nrecommendations to improve and enhance the\nprogram. Additionally, the Company continually\nworks to align its policies and practices with\nindustry-accepted information security\npractices as provided by the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology\nCybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), Payment\nCard Industry Data Security Standards (PCI\nDSS), and other applicable standards, laws,\nand regulations.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2024, the Company has not identified any\nspecific risks from cybersecurity threats that\nhave materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to affect, the Company\u2019s business\nstrategy, results of operations, or financial\ncondition, other than the risks described\nunder \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 Operations and Business\nRisk\u201d in the 2024 Annual Report. The Company\nmay not be successful in preventing or\nmitigating the impacts of a future\ncybersecurity incident that could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company or its\nbusiness strategy, results of operations or\nfinancial condition.\nThird Party Risks\nThe Company also maintains a third-party risk\nmanagement program responsible for the\noversight of outsourced operations, which\nenables the Company to oversee and identify\nrisks related to engaging third-party service\nproviders, including risks from\n                      14                      \ncybersecurity threats to third-party service\nproviders. T he Company conducts due diligence\nusing a risk-based approach in selecting and\nmonitoring third-party service providers. The\nCompany also obtains contractual assurances\nfrom third-party service providers relating to\ntheir security responsibilities, controls,\nreporting, and roles and responsibilities as\nit pertains to cybersecurity incident response\npolicies and notification requirements. As\nappropriate, the Company obtains independent\nreviews of the third parties\u2019 security through\naudit reports and testing and conducts\nverification and validation with third parties\nto confirm cybersecurity and information\nsecurity risks are appropriately identified,\nmeasured, mitigated, monitored, and reported\nby the third party to the Company.\nBoard of Directors Oversight\nAs part of its responsibility to oversee the\nmanagement, business, and strategy of the\nCompany, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors\nreviews and approves the Company\u2019s risk\nmanagement framework annually through its Risk\nManagement Committee and oversees the\nCompany\u2019s risk management processes by\ninforming itself about the Company\u2019s key risks\nand evaluating whether management has\nreasonable risk management and control\nprocesses in place to address those risks. The\nBoard carries out its risk management\noversight responsibilities primarily through\nits committees. Each Board committee is\nresponsible for overseeing certain risks under\nits charter. The Board\u2019s Risk Management\nCommittee, with support from its Cybersecurity\nand Technology Subcommittee, has primary\noversight responsibility for cybersecurity\nrisk, including risks from any cybersecurity\nthreats. The Risk Management Committee\nmonitors the Company\u2019s compliance with the\nrisk management framework and risk limits\nestablished under the Company\u2019s risk appetite\nstatement approved by the Board. The Risk\nManagement Committee also oversees the\nCompany\u2019s independent risk management\nfunction. The Cybersecurity and Technology\nSubcommittee has oversight responsibility for\ncybersecurity risk management and cyber\nresiliency and certain technology matters. The\nRisk Management Committee and its\nCybersecurity and Technology Subcommittee\nreceive quarterly reports from management on\ncybersecurity issues, including cybersecurity\nthreats. The Board\u2019s Risk Management Committee\nand Audit Committeealso hold a joint meeting\nannually at which they receive a report from\nthe Company\u2019s CISO on cybersecurity threats\nfacing the Company and its preparedness to\nmeet and respond to those threats. In\naddition, the full Board holds periodic\ncybersecurity education sessions, which may\nfeature the perspective of an outside expert\non current cybersecurity topics. The Company\nalso typically conducts an annual executive-\nlevel crisis exercise that includes a\ncybersecurity component to test its resiliency\nresponse, completeness of playbooks, and\ncommunication protocols. This exercise\ninvolves Board members, Managing Committee\nmembers, third-party companies, and\nregulators, as appropriate.\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework\nincludes its risk appetite statement, which is\napproved annually by the Board\u2019s Risk\nManagement Committee, and defines acceptable\nlevels of risk-taking and risk limits and\nestablishes the governance and oversight\nactivities over risk management and reporting.\nManagement monitors and measures the Company\u2019s\nrisk appetite using a quantitative risk\nscorecard consisting of risk appetite metrics\nand associated limits reported to the Board\u2019s\nRisk Management Committee on a quarterly\nbasis. The Company\u2019s risk appetite statement\nincludes specific information security metrics\nand associated limits. These limits also\ninform how matters, including cybersecurity\nincidents or threats, are escalated to\nspecific members of management, appropriate\nsenior operating committees (including the\nISRC and/or ERC), and/or the Board of\nDirectors or appropriate Board committee. The\nBoard\u2019s Risk Management Committee oversees the\nCompany\u2019s risk profile relative to its risk\nappetite and compliance with risk limits.\nManagement Oversight\nThe members of the Company\u2019s management that\nare primarily responsible for assessing and\nmanaging risks from cybersecurity threats,\nincluding monitoring risk appetite metrics and\nlimits related to cybersecurity, include the\nCompany\u2019s CISO, Chief Risk Officer, and Chief\nInformation and Technology Officer.\nThe Company\u2019s CISO is primarily responsible\nfor the implementation of defense capabilities\nand risk mitigation strategies. T he Company\u2019s\nCISO, Timothy J. Held, has over 27 years of\ninformation technology and cybersecurity\nexperience. He holds the title of Executive\nVice President and Chief Information Security\nOfficer and has been in his role since 2018,\nhaving served as the Company\u2019s Deputy CISO\nfrom 2015 to 2018 and Head of Cyber Defense,\nThreat Intelligence, and Incident Response\nfrom 2012 to 2018. The CISO is supported by\nhis direct reports and their teams, many of\nwhom hold cybersecurity-related\ncertifications.\nThe Company\u2019s CISO reports to the Vice Chair\nand Chief Risk Officer, Jodi L. Richard, who\nhas served in that position since October\n2018. She served as Executive Vice President\nand Chief Operational Risk Officer of the\nCompany from January 2018 until October 2018,\nhaving served as Senior Vice President and\nChief Operational Risk Officer from 2014 until\nJanuary 2018. Prior to that time, Ms. Richard\nheld various senior leadership roles at HSBC\nfrom 2003 until 2014, including Executive Vice\nPresident and Head of Operational Risk and\nInternal Control at HSBC North America from\n2008 to 2014.\nVenkatachari Dilip, the Company\u2019s Senior\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Information\nand Technology Officer, has oversight of\ntechnology-related risk management issues and\ncontrols that align to the NIST CSF. Mr. Dilip\npreviously was an Executive Vice President\nfrom September 2018 to April 2023 and has\nserved as Chief Information and Technology\nOfficer since joining the Company in September\n2018. From May 2014 until July 2017, he served\nas Vice President at McKinsey Digital where he\nhelped banks accelerate their digital\ntransformation. From April 2009 to September\n2013, he served as CEO at Compass Labs leading\nan innovative marketing analytics company.\nFrom March 2006 until April 2008, he served as\nDirector of Products at Google where he led\nproduct teams for mobile ads and Google\nCheckout. From March 2004 until March 2006, he\nserved as Vice President of PayPal/eBay and on\nthe Board of PayPal Europe, where he was\nresponsible for Payments Services, Risk and\nFraud Management. Previously, Mr. Dilip co-\nfounded and led startup companies CashEdge and\nCommerceSoft from 1996 until 2003.\n                      15                      \nThe CISO and his leadership team generally\nmeet each business day to discuss security\nitem triage and emerging threats and trends\nidentified by the Threat Intelligence Team.\nThe CISO shares pertinent information from\nthose meetings with the Chief Risk Officer.\nDuring a cyber incident, which could involve\nthe Company or a third-party service provider\nto the Company, the Company\u2019s Cyber Security\nIncident Response Team (CSIRT) leads the\nresponse and internal communication. CSIRT\nmanages low and moderate severity incidents,\nand Enterprise Crisis Management manages high\nand very high severity incidents. The risk\nrating of an incident may change throughout\nthe incident investigation period as new\ninformation is learned or the environment\nchanges. Depending on severity level, CSIRT or\nEnterprise Crisis Management distributes\nincident communications to senior management,\nincluding the Chief Executive Officer, Chief\nRisk Officer, Board of Directors or\nappropriate Board committee, and if\napplicable, the Company\u2019s regulators.\n\nISS leadership reports prevention, detection,\nmitigation, and remediation activities through\nvarious working groups and committees.
