As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company employed a\ntotal of 75,465 employees globally.\n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion The Company\ncontinues to expand its talent pipeline to\nincrease the representation of women at\nleadership levels and people of color at all\nlevels, including at the executive and senior\nmanagement levels. The Company\u2019s hiring\nprogram strives to include the inclusion of at\nleast one woman or one person of color on\ninterview slates for all roles at the Company.\nIn addition, the Company offers various\nmentorship, leadership and development\nopportunities that enable participants,\nincluding women and people of color, to\nenhance networks, key skills and work\nexperiences. The Company also provides\ninclusive leadership learning journeys\ndesigned to coach and develop its leaders in\ndriving employee and team performance through\ninclusive behaviors and best practices.\n\nTo help create and sustain an inclusive\nworkforce, the Company sponsors Business\nResource Groups (\u201cBRGs\u201d), including Asian\nheritage, Black heritage, Nosotros Latinos,\nIndigenous Peoples, U.S. Bank women, Spectrum\nLGBTQ, Proud to Serve: Military and Veterans,\nEuropean Inclusion, and Disability employee\ngroups, with chapters across the Company and\nmembership available to all employees. These\nBRGs enable employees from a wide variety of\nbackgrounds, identities and perspectives to\nconnect in ways that empower them to\ncontribute, innovate and grow. Through these\nBRGs, employees can come together to discuss\ntopics of interest to them, develop\nprofessional skills and build overall employee\nengagement,\n                      4                       \nhelping to create and sustain an inclusive\nworkforce that drives business growth and\npropels accountability for diversity and\ninclusion within the Company.\n\nThese programs, practices and policies are\npart of the Company\u2019s strategy to have an\nethnically and gender diverse employee base.\nAs of December 31, 2023, of the Company\u2019s\nemployees in the United States, 57 percent\nwere women and 39 percent were people of\ncolor. As of December 31, 2023, 34 percent of\nthe Company\u2019s employees at the executive and\nsenior management levels in the United States\nwere women and 21 percent were people of\ncolor. In addition, as of December 31, 2023,\nof the Company\u2019s 13 directors, 5 were women\nand 4 were people of color. All diversity\ninformation is based on information self-\ndisclosed by the employee or director to the\nCompany. To provide transparency on progress\nrelating to its commitment to seek and promote\ndiverse talent, the Company publicly discloses\nconsolidated EEO-1 data on its website.\n\nEquitable and Competitive Compensation, Health\n& Wellness Programs Maintaining competitive\ncompensation and benefits practices is a\ncontinued focus for the Company, with periodic\npeer and benchmarking reviews used to assist\nwith competitive alignment and employee\nretention. The Company remains committed to\nfair pay and continues to prioritize pay\nequity efforts. To further the Company\u2019s\nefforts to provide fair and equitable\ncompensation to its employees, the Company has\nprocesses to address any gender and racial pay\ninequities identified within its workforce.\nThis work starts with fair hiring practices.\nThe Company also has guidelines in place for\nboth internal and external job postings to\nassist the Company\u2019s leaders in making fair\ncompensation decisions based on the demands\nand responsibilities of each role, candidate\nexperience, and pay related to comparable\ninternal positions. As part of the Company's\nefforts to enhance pay transparency, all open\npositions in the United States have a\ndisclosed compensation range. The Company\nconducts periodic reviews of base pay of\nemployee groups across gender and racial\ncategories with the assistance of an\nindependent third-party consultant. Should\ngender or race-based disparities in pay be\nidentified, the Company adjusts compensation\nlevels to eliminate those disparities. In the\n2023 review, on average, employees of the\nCompany in the United States who are women\nwere paid greater than 99 percent of what\ntheir male counterparts were paid, and\nemployees of the Company in the United States\nwho are people of color were paid greater than\n99 percent of what their white counterparts\nwere paid, in each case taking into account\nseveral factors including comparable jobs,\nexperience and location. The 2023 review\nexcluded employees from the MUB acquisition\nwho had not transitioned into the Company's\npay structures.\n\nThe Company also provides its employees with\ncomprehensive benefits programs, including\ncompetitive healthcare, retirement, leave,\nrecognition, wellness, disability, life\ninsurance, time-off, flexible work, and\neducational assistance programs, based on the\nCompany\u2019s recognition that such benefits are\nimportant to attract and retain employees. In\naddition to its competitive 401(k) matching\nprogram, the Company maintains an active cash\nbalance pension program for its U.S.\nemployees, including newly hired employees.\n\nThe Company continues to support flexible work\nprograms with remote and in-person work\narrangements, providing additional optionality\nand flexibility for most employees, which\nhelps the Company attract and retain talent.\nThe Company continues to adapt and evolve its\nflexible work programs as it recognizes the\nchanges to employee and customer priorities\nand its customers\u2019 and employees' changing\nneeds.\n\nEmployee Engagement and Retention As part of\nits efforts to develop and retain skilled\nemployees, the Company remains focused on\nmonitoring employee engagement. The Company\u2019s\nemployee listening program enables the Company\nto collect quantitative and qualitative\nfeedback from employees on an ongoing basis,\nwhich then supports and informs the Company on\nhuman capital strategies and decisions.\n\nAs part of its talent strategy, the Company\nstrives to support continuous employee\nlearning and development. The Company provides\na number of talent development opportunities\nfor employees to enhance skills that are\ncritical in the current and future working\nenvironment and empowers employees to discover\nways to thrive and grow their careers, which\naligns with the Company\u2019s Employment Value\nProposition. For example, the Company\u2019s\nlearning programs include the Digital and\nLeadership Academies, which focus on digital\nand core leadership skill development. The\nCompany continues to deploy cultural\nsensitivity and customer interaction training\nfor its frontline employees that focuses on\nbuilding skills to serve all the Company's\ncustomers with excellence. In addition, every\nemployee is automatically included in the\nCompany\u2019s Development Network that provides\nall employees with opportunities to network,\nlearn, develop leadership skills and\ncontribute to the Company and its communities.\nSuccession planning and talent development\nprocesses remain a top priority for the\nCompany along with continuous improvements to\nits training and development programs. During\n2023, employees completed over 3 million hours\nof training through the Company\u2019s enterprise\nlearning programs to better support their\nprofessional development and customer and\nbusiness needs.\n\nHuman Capital Governance The Company\u2019s Board\nof Directors oversees the Company\u2019s human\ncapital management. The Board\u2019s Compensation\nand Human Resources Committee discharges the\nBoard\u2019s oversight responsibilities relating to\nthe Company\u2019s compensation programs and\nemployee benefit plans, overseeing the\nCompany\u2019s human capital strategy and talent\nmanagement program and employee diversity,\nequity and inclusion initiatives. Coordinating\nwith the Compensation and Human Resources\nCommittee, the Board\u2019s Public Responsibility\nCommittee also oversees the Company\u2019s\ndiversity, equity\n                      5                       \nand inclusion strategy. The Company\u2019s Chief\nHuman Resources Officer regularly reports to\nthe Board\u2019s Compensation and Human Resources\nCommittee on human capital matters such as\nhuman resource practices and programs,\nincluding employee benefits and compensation\nprograms. To promote accountability for the\nCompany\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion\nefforts, the Company\u2019s Chief Diversity Officer\nreports directly to the Chief Executive\nOfficer and serves as a member of its senior\nmanagement team.\n                                              \n  Competition                                 \n                                              \nThe financial services industry is highly\ncompetitive. The Company competes with other\ncommercial banks, savings and loan\nassociations, mutual savings banks, finance\ncompanies, mortgage banking companies, credit\nunions, investment companies, credit card\ncompanies and a variety of other financial\nservices, advisory and technology companies.\nThe financial services industry continues to\nundergo rapid technological change with\nfrequent introductions of new technology-\ndriven products and services, including\ninnovative ways that customers can make\npayments or manage their accounts, such as\nthrough the use of mobile payments, digital\nwallets or digital currencies. In recent\nyears, competition has increased from\ninstitutions not subject to the same\nregulatory restrictions as domestic banks and\nbank holding companies, including by financial\ntechnology companies, or \u201cfintechs,\u201d which may\noffer bank-like products or services that\ncompete directly with the Company\u2019s products\nand services. Competition is based on a number\nof factors, including, among others, customer\nservice, quality and range of products and\nservices offered, price, reputation, interest\nrates on loans and deposits, lending limits\nand customer convenience, including the\nability to address customer needs by using\ntechnology to provide products and services\nthat customers want to adopt. The Company\u2019s\nability to continue to compete effectively\nalso depends in large part on its ability to\nattract new employees and retain and motivate\nexisting employees, while managing\ncompensation and other costs. For additional\ninformation relating to how the Company\nattracts and retains employees, see \u201cHuman\nCapital\u201d above.\n                                              \n  Government Policies                         \n                                              \nThe operations of the Company\u2019s various\nbusinesses are affected by federal and state\nlaws and legislative changes and by policies\nof various regulatory authorities of the\nnumerous states in which they operate, the\nUnited States and foreign governments. These\nlaws, rules and policies include, for example,\nstatutory maximum legal lending rates,\ndomestic monetary policies of the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (the\n\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d), United States fiscal\npolicy, international currency regulations and\nmonetary policies and capital adequacy and\nliquidity constraints imposed by bank\nregulatory agencies.\n                                              \n  Supervision and Regulation                  \n                                              \nU.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject\nto the extensive regulatory framework\napplicable to bank holding companies (\u201cBHCs\u201d)\nand their subsidiaries. This regulatory\nframework is intended primarily for the\nprotection of depositors, the deposit\ninsurance fund (the \u201cDIF\u201d) of the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (the \u201cFDIC\u201d),\nconsumers, the stability of the financial\nsystem in the United States, and the health of\nthe national economy, and not for investors in\nthe Company.\n\nThis section summarizes certain provisions of\nthe principal laws and regulations applicable\nto the Company and its subsidiaries. The\ndescriptions are not intended to be complete\nand are qualified in their entirety by\nreference to the full text of the statutes and\nregulations described below.\n\nGeneral As a BHC, the Company is subject to\nregulation under the BHC Act and to\ninspection, examination and supervision by the\nFederal Reserve. USBNA and its subsidiaries\nare subject to regulation, examination and\nsupervision primarily by the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (the \u201cOCC\u201d) and\nalso by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (the\n\u201cCFPB\u201d), the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and the Commodities\nFutures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) in\ncertain areas.\n\nSupervision and regulation by the responsible\nregulatory agencies generally include\ncomprehensive annual reviews of all major\naspects of the Company\u2019s and USBNA\u2019s business\nand condition, regular on-site examinations,\nand imposition of periodic reporting\nrequirements and limitations on investments\nand certain types of activities. If an\napplicable regulatory agency deems the Company\nto be operating in a manner that is\ninconsistent with safe and sound banking\npractices, such agency can require the entry\ninto informal or formal supervisory\nagreements, including board resolutions,\nmemoranda of understanding, written agreements\nand consent or cease and desist orders,\npursuant to which the Company would be\nrequired to take identified corrective actions\nto address cited concerns and to refrain from\ntaking certain actions. Supervision and\nexaminations are confidential, and the\noutcomes of these actions generally are not\nmade public.\n\nBanking and other financial services statutes,\nregulations and policies are continually under\nreview by the United States Congress, state\nlegislatures and federal and state regulatory\nagencies. In addition to laws and regulations,\nstate and federal bank regulatory agencies may\nissue policy statements, interpretive letters\nand similar written guidance applicable to the\n                      6                       \nCompany and its subsidiaries. Any change in\nthe statutes, regulations or regulatory\npolicies applicable to the Company, including\nchanges in their interpretation or\nimplementation, could have a material effect\non its business or organization.\n\nAs a BHC with over $100 billion in total\nconsolidated assets, the Company is subject to\nthe Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s enhanced prudential\nstandards, as applied to \u201cCategory III\u201d\ninstitutions under the federal banking\nregulators\u2019 rules that tailor how enhanced\nprudential standards apply to large U.S.\nbanking organizations (the \u201cTailoring Rules\u201d).\nThe Tailoring Rules also apply certain\nenhanced prudential standards to its\nsubsidiary depository institution, USBNA, as\ndescribed in more detail below.\n\nIn connection with the Company\u2019s acquisition\nof MUB, the Company committed (the \u201cFederal\nReserve Commitments\u201d) to submit to the Federal\nReserve quarterly implementation plans for\ncomplying with requirements applicable to\n\u201cCategory II\u201d institutions ( i.e. ,\ninstitutions with $700 billion or more in\ntotal assets or $75 billion or more in cross-\njurisdictional activities). The Company also\ncommitted to meet requirements applicable to\nCategory II institutions by the earlier of (i)\nthe date required under the Tailoring Rules;\nand (ii) December 31, 2024, if the Federal\nReserve notifies the Company by January 1,\n2024, that the Company must comply with such\nrules. On October 16, 2023, the Federal\nReserve granted the Company relief from both\nof these commitments. As a result, the Company\nwill continue to be subject to the regulatory\ncapital and liquidity requirements applicable\nto Category III institutions until otherwise\nrequired under the Tailoring Rules (i.e.,\nuntil the Company\u2019s total average consolidated\nassets for the then most recent four quarters\nequal $700 billion or more or the amount of\nthe Company\u2019s average cross-jurisdictional\nactivities for the then most recent four\nquarters equals $75 billion or more).\n\nSupervisory Ratings Federal banking regulators\nregularly examine the Company and its insured\ndepository institution subsidiary, USBNA.\nFollowing those exams, the Company (under the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s Large Financial Institution\nRating System) and USBNA (under the CAMELS\nrating system) are assigned supervisory\nratings. Disclosure of these ratings to third\nparties is not allowed without permission of\nthe issuing regulator. A downgrade in these\nratings could limit the Company\u2019s ability to\npursue acquisitions or conduct other\nexpansionary activities for a period of time,\nrequire new or additional regulatory approvals\nbefore engaging in certain other business\nactivities or investments, affect USBNA\u2019s\ndeposit insurance assessment rates, limit the\nCompany's access to funding through\ngovernment-sponsored liquidity programs, and\nimpose additional recordkeeping and corporate\ngovernance requirements, as well as generally\nincrease regulatory scrutiny of the Company.\n\nBHC Activities The Company is a BHC under the\nBHC Act and has elected to be a financial\nholding company (\u201cFHC\u201d). BHCs that qualify and\nelect to be treated as FHCs may engage in, and\naffiliate with financial companies engaging\nin, a broader range of activities than would\notherwise be permitted for a BHC.\n\nIf an FHC or a depository institution\ncontrolled by an FHC ceases to be well-\ncapitalized or well-managed, the Federal\nReserve may impose corrective capital and\nmanagerial requirements on the FHC and may\nplace limitations on its ability to conduct\nall of the business activities that FHCs are\ngenerally permitted to conduct and its ability\nto make certain acquisitions. See \u201cPermissible\nBusiness Activities\u201d below. Disclosure of any\nfailure to meet these standards is not allowed\nwithout permission of the Federal Reserve. If\nthe failure to meet these standards persists,\nthe FHC may be required to divest its\ndepository institution subsidiaries or cease\nall activities other than those activities\nthat may be conducted by BHCs that are not\nFHCs. In addition, if a depository institution\ncontrolled by an FHC does not receive a\nCommunity Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) rating of\nat least \u201csatisfactory\u201d at its most recent\nexamination, the Federal Reserve will prohibit\nthe FHC from conducting new business\nactivities that FHCs are generally permitted\nto conduct and from making certain\nacquisitions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also requires BHCs to meet\ncertain applicable capital and management\nstandards. Failure by the Company to meet\nthese standards could limit the Company from\nengaging in any new activity or acquiring\nother companies without the prior approval of\nthe Federal Reserve.\n\nPermissible Business Activities As an FHC, the\nCompany may affiliate with securities firms\nand insurance companies and engage in other\nactivities that are financial in nature or\nincidental or complementary to activities that\nare financial in nature. \u201cFinancial in nature\u201d\nactivities include securities underwriting,\ndealing and market making; sponsoring mutual\nfunds and investment companies; insurance\nunderwriting and agency; merchant banking; and\nactivities that the Federal Reserve, in\nconsultation with the Secretary of the United\nStates Treasury, determines to be financial in\nnature or incidental to such financial\nactivity. \u201cComplementary activities\u201d are\nactivities that the Federal Reserve determines\nupon application to be complementary to a\nfinancial activity and that do not pose a\nsafety and soundness risk.\n\nThe Company generally is not required to\nobtain Federal Reserve approval to acquire a\ncompany engaged in activities that are\nfinancial in nature or incidental to\nactivities that are financial in nature, as\nlong as the Company meets the capital,\nmanagerial and CRA requirements to qualify as\nan FHC. However, the Company is required to\nreceive approval for an acquisition in which\nthe total consolidated assets to be acquired\nexceed $10 billion. FHCs are also required to\nobtain the approval of the Federal Reserve\nbefore they may acquire more than five percent\nof the voting shares or substantially all of\nthe\n                      7                       \nassets of an unaffiliated BHC, bank or savings\nassociation. In addition, banks must receive\napproval before they may acquire, merge with,\nacquire substantially all of the assets of or\nassume any deposits of a bank or savings\nassociation and may be required to receive\napproval for acquisitions of other companies.\n\nInterstate Banking A BHC may acquire banks in\nstates other than its home state, subject to\nany state requirement that the bank has been\norganized and operating for a minimum period\nof time (not to exceed five years). Also, such\nan acquisition is not permitted if the BHC\ncontrols, prior to or following the proposed\nacquisition, more than 10 percent of the total\namount of deposits of insured depository\ninstitutions nationwide or, if the acquisition\nis the BHC\u2019s initial entry into the state,\nmore than 30 percent of the deposits of\ninsured depository institutions in the state\n(or any lesser or greater amount set by the\nstate). Banks may merge across state lines to\ncreate interstate branches and are permitted\nto establish new branches in another state to\nthe same extent as banks chartered by that\nstate.\n\nRegulatory Approval for Acquisitions In\ndetermining whether to approve a proposed bank\nacquisition, federal bank regulators will\nconsider a number of factors, including the\neffect of the acquisition on competition,\nfinancial condition and future prospects\n(including current and projected capital\nratios and levels); the competence, experience\nand integrity of management and its record of\ncompliance with laws and regulations; the\nconvenience and needs of the communities to be\nserved (including the acquiring institution\u2019s\nrecord of compliance under the CRA); the\neffectiveness of the acquiring institution in\ncombating money laundering activities; and the\nextent to which the transaction would result\nin greater or more concentrated risks to the\nstability of the United States banking or\nfinancial system. In addition, approval of\ninterstate transactions requires that the\nacquiror satisfy regulatory standards for\nwell-capitalized and well-managed\ninstitutions.\n\nSource of Strength The Company is required to\nact as a source of strength to USBNA, and to\ncommit capital and financial resources to\nsupport USBNA in circumstances where the\nCompany might not otherwise do so. Under these\nrequirements, the Federal Reserve may in the\nfuture require the Company to provide\nfinancial assistance to USBNA, should it\nexperience financial distress. Capital loans\nby the Company to USBNA would be subordinate\nin right of payment to deposits and certain\nother debts of USBNA.\n\nOCC Heightened Standards USBNA is subject to\nthe OCC\u2019s guidelines establishing heightened\nstandards for large national banks, which\nestablish minimum standards for the design and\nimplementation of a risk governance framework\nfor banks. The OCC may take action against\ninstitutions that fail to meet these\nstandards.\n\nEnhanced Prudential Standards Under the Dodd-\nFrank Act, as modified by the Economic Growth,\nRegulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act\nand the Tailoring Rules, large bank holding\ncompanies, such as the Company, are subject to\ncertain enhanced prudential standards based on\nthe banking organization\u2019s size and certain\n\u201crisk-based indicators.\u201d The prudential\nstandards include enhanced risk-based capital\nand leverage requirements, enhanced liquidity\nrequirements, enhanced risk management and\nrisk committee requirements, a requirement to\nsubmit a resolution plan, single-counterparty\ncredit limits and stress tests. Certain of the\nenhanced prudential standards applicable to\nthe Company are described below in further\ndetail.\n\nDividend Restrictions The Company is a legal\nentity separate and distinct from its\nsubsidiaries. Typically, the majority of the\nCompany\u2019s operating funds are received in the\nform of dividends paid to the Company by\nUSBNA. Federal law imposes limitations on the\npayment of dividends by national banks. In\ngeneral, dividends payable by USBNA and the\nCompany\u2019s trust bank subsidiaries, as national\nbanking associations, are limited by rules\nthat compare dividends to net income for\nperiods defined by regulation.\n\nThe OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC also\nhave authority to prohibit or limit the\npayment of dividends by the banking\norganizations they supervise (including the\nCompany and USBNA) if, in the banking\nregulator\u2019s opinion, payment of a dividend\nwould constitute an unsafe or unsound practice\nin light of the financial condition of the\nbanking organization.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve\u2019s final rule\nimplementing the stress capital buffer (\u201cSCB\u201d)\nprovides that a BHC must receive prior\napproval for any dividend, stock repurchase or\nother capital distribution, other than a\ncapital distribution on a newly issued capital\ninstrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit\nits capital plan. The rule also provides that\na BHC must resubmit its capital plan if, among\nother things, the BHC determines there has\nbeen or will be a material change in the BHC\u2019s\nrisk profile, financial condition, or\ncorporate structure since the BHC last\nsubmitted its capital plan.\n\nCapital Requirements The Company is subject to\ncertain regulatory risk-based capital and\nleverage requirements under capital rules\nadopted by the Federal Reserve, and USBNA is\nsubject to substantially similar rules adopted\nby the OCC. These rules implement the Basel\nCommittee\u2019s framework for strengthening the\nregulation, supervision and risk management of\nbanks (\u201cBasel III\u201d), as well as certain\nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. These\nquantitative calculations are minimums, and\nthe Federal Reserve and OCC may determine that\na banking organization, based on its size,\ncomplexity or risk profile, must maintain a\nhigher level of capital in order to operate in\na safe and sound manner.\n                      8                       \nUnder the Tailoring Rules, the Company and\nUSBNA are each currently subject to \u201cCategory\nIII\u201d standards, and are \u201cstandardized\napproach\u201d banking organizations that are\nsubject to rules that provide for simplified\ncapital requirements relating to the threshold\ndeductions for mortgage servicing assets,\ndeferred tax assets arising from temporary\ndifferences that a banking organization could\nnot realize through net operating loss carry\nbacks, and investments in the capital of\nunconsolidated financial institutions, as well\nas the inclusion of minority interests in\nregulatory capital. Growth in total\nconsolidated assets (including assets obtained\nin acquisitions) or cross-jurisdictional\nactivity (as defined in the Tailoring Rules)\ncould affect the Company\u2019s continued\nclassification as a \u201cCategory III\u201d\ninstitution, which could result in the Company\nand its insured depository institution\nsubsidiary becoming \u201cadvanced approaches\u201d\nbanking organizations, a requirement to\nrecognize elements of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income in regulatory capital, as\nwell as other more stringent capital,\nliquidity, and other regulatory requirements.\n\nUnder the United States Basel III-based\ncapital rules, the Company is subject to a\nminimum common equity tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) capital\nratio (CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets)\nof 4.5 percent, a minimum tier 1 capital ratio\nof 6.0 percent and a minimum total capital\nratio of 8.0 percent. At December 31, 2023,\nthe Company exceeded these minimum capital\nratio requirements. The Company is also\nsubject to the SCB, which is based on the\nresults of the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory\nstress tests and the Company\u2019s planned common\nstock dividends, and, if deployed by the\nFederal Reserve, up to a 2.5 percent common\nequity tier 1 countercyclical capital buffer.\nThese additional requirements must be\nsatisfied entirely with capital that qualifies\nas CET1. Although the Federal Reserve has not\nto date raised the countercyclical capital\nbuffer above zero percent, the countercyclical\ncapital buffer could change in the future. The\nSCB generally is assigned on an annual basis\nand becomes effective on October 1 of each\nyear, subject to a 2.5 percent floor, and may\nvary over time. As of December 31, 2023, the\nSCB applicable to the Company is 2.5 percent.\nIf the Federal Reserve were to raise the\ncountercyclical capital buffer, or if the SCB\napplicable to the Company were to exceed 2.5\npercent, this would also change the effective\nminimum capital ratios to which the Company is\nsubject. For USBNA, the buffer requirement\nconsists of the static capital conservation\nbuffer equal to 2.5 percent of risk-weighted\nassets.\n\nBanking organizations that fail to meet the\neffective minimum ratios will be subject to\nconstraints on capital distributions,\nincluding dividends and share repurchases, and\ncertain discretionary executive compensation,\nwith the severity of the constraints depending\non the extent of the shortfall and \u201celigible\nretained income\u201d (defined as the greater of\n(i) net income for the four preceding\nquarters, net of distributions and associated\ntax effects not reflected in net income; and\n(ii) the average of all net income over the\npreceding four quarters).\n\nUnited States banking organizations are also\nsubject to a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of\n4.0 percent. As a Category III banking\norganization, the Company is also subject to a\nminimum Supplementary Leverage Ratio (\u201cSLR\u201d)\nof 3.0 percent that takes into account both\non-balance sheet and certain off-balance sheet\nexposures. At December 31, 2023, the Company\nexceeded the applicable minimum tier 1\nleverage ratio and SLR requirements.\n\nIn July 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory\nauthorities proposed a rule implementing the\nBasel Committee\u2019s finalization of the post-\ncrisis regulatory capital reforms, commonly\nreferred to as \u201cBasel III Endgame.\u201d The\nproposal provides for a July 1, 2025 effective\ndate, subject to a three-year transition\nperiod. The proposal would set stricter\ncriteria for the use of internal models by\nreplacing the market risk rule with the\n\u201cFundamental Review of the Trading Book,\u201d and\nwould introduce new standardized approaches\nfor credit risk, operational risk and credit\nvaluation adjustment risk, which would replace\nthe current models-based approaches. In\naddition, under the proposed rule, also\nsubject to a phase-in period, Category III\nbanking institutions, such as the Company,\nwould no longer be permitted to opt out of\nincluding certain components of accumulated\nother comprehensive income in regulatory\ncapital, which would result in unrealized\ngains and losses on available-for-sale\nsecurities being included in the calculation\nof the Company\u2019s regulatory capital ratios.\nThe Company continues to evaluate the\npotential effects of the proposed rule, and\nthe effects on the Company will depend on the\nfinal form of any rulemaking. However, the\nCompany expects that any final rule would\nresult in the Company being required to\nmaintain increased levels of regulatory\ncapital.\n\nIn 2020, the United States federal banking\nagencies adopted a rule that allowed banking\norganizations, including the Company and\nUSBNA, to elect to delay temporarily the\nestimated effects of adopting the current\nexpected credit loss accounting standard\n(\u201cCECL\u201d) on regulatory capital until January\n2022 and subsequently to phase in the effects\nthrough January 2025. Through the 2023 stress\ntest cycle, the Federal Reserve has not yet\nincorporated CECL into the calculation of the\nallowance for credit losses in supervisory\nstress tests, and the Federal Reserve issued\nguidance in December 2023 to indicate that it\nwill maintain the current framework for\nallowance for credit losses in the supervisory\nstress test through the 2024 stress test\ncycle. For further discussion of CECL, see\nNotes 1 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in the 2023 Annual\nReport. The Company and USBNA elected to delay\nand subsequently phase in the regulatory\ncapital impact of CECL in accordance with this\nrule.\n\nFor additional information regarding the\nCompany\u2019s regulatory capital, see \u201cCapital\nManagement\u201d in the 2023 Annual Report.\n                      9                       \nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review As\nrequired by the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(\u201cCCAR\u201d) rules, the Company submits a capital\nplan to the Federal Reserve on an annual\nbasis. As part of the CCAR process, the\nFederal Reserve evaluates the Company\u2019s plans\nto make capital distributions, including by\nrepurchasing stock or making dividend\npayments, under a number of macroeconomic and\nCompany-specific assumptions based on the\nCompany\u2019s and the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress\ntests described under \u201cStress Testing\u201d below.\nThese capital plans consist of a number of\nmandatory elements, including an assessment of\na company\u2019s sources and uses of capital over a\nnine-quarter planning horizon assuming both\nexpected and stressful conditions; a detailed\ndescription of a company\u2019s process for\nassessing capital adequacy; and a\ndemonstration of a company\u2019s ability to\nmaintain capital above each minimum regulatory\ncapital ratio (without taking the buffers into\naccount) under expected and stressful\nconditions.\n\nStress Testing The Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR\nframework and the Dodd-Frank Act stress\ntesting framework require BHCs subject to\nCategory III standards such as the Company to\nconduct an annual internal stress test in\nconnection with its annual capital plan\nsubmission as well as biennial company-run\nstress tests, and subject such BHCs to annual\nsupervisory stress tests conducted by the\nFederal Reserve. Among other things, the\ncompany-run stress tests employ stress\nscenarios developed by the Company as well as\nstress scenarios provided by the Federal\nReserve and incorporate the Dodd-Frank Act\ncapital actions (as opposed to the Company\u2019s\nplanned capital actions), which are intended\nto normalize capital distributions across\nlarge U.S. BHCs. The Federal Reserve conducts\nCCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress\ntests employing stress scenarios and internal\nsupervisory models and incorporates the\nCompany\u2019s planned capital actions and the\nDodd-Frank Act capital actions, respectively,\ninto its stress tests. The Federal Reserve and\nthe Company are currently required to publish\nthe results of the annual supervisory and\nbiennial company-run stress tests,\nrespectively, no later than June 30 of each\napplicable year. If the Company were to become\na \u201cCategory II\u201d institution for purposes of\nthe Tailoring Rules, the Company would become\nsubject to annual (rather than biennial)\ncompany-run stress tests.\n\nUnder the OCC\u2019s rules, national banks with\nassets in excess of $250 billion, including\nUSBNA, are required to submit company-run\nstress test results to the OCC concurrently\nwith their parent BHC\u2019s CCAR submission to the\nFederal Reserve. The stress test is based on\nthe OCC\u2019s stress scenarios (which are\ntypically the same as the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nstress scenarios) and capital actions that are\nappropriate for the economic conditions\nassumed in each scenario.\n\nBasel III Liquidity Requirements As Category\nIII banking organizations, the Company and\nUSBNA are each subject to a minimum liquidity\ncoverage ratio (\"LCR\") under the Tailoring\nRules. The LCR is designed to ensure that BHCs\nhave sufficient high-quality liquid assets to\nsurvive a significant liquidity stress event\nlasting for 30 calendar days. In addition, the\nCompany and USBNA are subject to the net\nstable funding ratio (\"NSFR\") rule, which is\ndesigned to promote stable, longer-term\nfunding of assets and business activities over\na one-year time horizon. Under the Tailoring\nRules and NSFR rule, the Company and USBNA, as\nCategory III banking organizations with less\nthan $75 billion of weighted short-term\nwholesale funding, qualify for reduced LCR and\nNSFR requirements calibrated at 85 percent of\nthe full requirements. If the Company were to\nbecome a \u201cCategory II\u201d institution for\npurposes of the Tailoring Rules, the Company\nwould become subject to the full (100 percent)\nLCR and NSFR requirements, as well as daily\n(rather than monthly) liquidity reporting\nrequirements.\n\nPrompt Corrective Action The Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation Improvement Act\n(\u201cFDICIA\u201d) provides a framework for regulation\nof depository institutions and their\naffiliates (including parent holding\ncompanies) by federal banking regulators. As\npart of that framework, the FDICIA requires\nthe relevant federal banking regulator to take\n\u201cprompt corrective action\u201d with respect to an\nFDIC-insured depository institution, such as\nUSBNA, if that institution does not meet\ncertain capital adequacy standards.\nSupervisory actions by the appropriate federal\nbanking regulator under the \u201cprompt corrective\naction\u201d rules generally depend upon an\ninstitution\u2019s classification within five\ncapital categories. An institution that fails\nto remain well-capitalized becomes subject to\na series of restrictions that increase in\nseverity as its capital condition weakens.\nSuch restrictions may include a prohibition on\ncapital distributions, restrictions on asset\ngrowth or restrictions on the ability to\nreceive regulatory approval of applications.\nThe FDICIA also provides for enhanced\nsupervisory authority over undercapitalized\ninstitutions, including authority for the\nappointment of a conservator or receiver for\nthe institution.\n\nPrompt corrective action regulations apply\nonly to banks and not to BHCs such as the\nCompany. However, the Federal Reserve is\nauthorized to take appropriate action at the\nBHC level, based on the undercapitalized\nstatus of the BHC\u2019s subsidiary banking\ninstitutions. In certain instances, relating\nto an undercapitalized bank, the BHC would be\nrequired to guarantee the performance of the\nundercapitalized subsidiary\u2019s capital\nrestoration plan and could be liable for civil\nmoney damages for failure to fulfill those\nguarantee commitments.\n\nLong-Term Debt Requirements In August 2023,\nthe Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC issued a\nproposed rule that would require, among other\ninstitutions, each Category III U.S. BHC,\nincluding the Company, and each insured\ndepository institution with $100 billion or\nmore in total consolidated assets that is a\nconsolidated subsidiary of a Category III U.S.\nBHC, such as USBNA, to have minimum levels of\noutstanding long-term debt. The proposed rule\nis intended to improve the resolvability of\nthe banking organizations covered by the rule.\nUnder the proposed rule, covered banking\norganizations would be required to maintain\nlong-term debt in an amount that is equal to\nthe greater of (i) 6% of the organization\u2019s\nrisk-weighted\n                      10                      \nassets; (ii) 3.5% of the organization\u2019s\naverage total consolidated assets; and (iii)\n2.5% of the organization\u2019s total leverage\nexposure, if the organization is subject to\nthe SLR rule. The requirement would be phased\nin over three years, with covered banking\norganizations being required to meet 25% of\nthe requirement within one year after\nfinalization of the rule, 50% after two years\nand 100% after three years. The Company\ncontinues to evaluate the potential effects of\nthe proposed rule. Although any effects on the\nCompany and USBNA will depend on the final\nform of any rulemaking, the Company expects\nthat under any final rule, it and USBNA would\nbe required to maintain substantially more\nlong-term debt than it currently maintains.\n\nDeposit Insurance The DIF provides insurance\ncoverage for certain deposits, up to a\nstandard maximum deposit insurance amount of\n$250,000 per depositor. Deposits at USBNA are\ninsured up to the applicable limits. The DIF\nis funded through assessments on insured\ndepository institutions, including USBNA,\nbased on the risk each institution poses to\nthe DIF. The FDIC may increase USBNA\u2019s\ninsurance premiums based on various factors,\nincluding the FDIC\u2019s assessment of its risk\nprofile.\n\nIn addition, large insured depository\ninstitutions, including USBNA, are subject to\nenhanced deposit account recordkeeping and\nrelated information technology system\nrequirements meant to facilitate prompt\npayment of insured deposits if such an\ninstitution were to fail.\n\nIn October 2022, the FDIC finalized a rule to\nincrease the initial base deposit insurance\nassessment rate schedules for all insured\ndepository institutions by two basis points,\nbeginning with the first quarterly assessment\nperiod of 2023. The increased assessment rate\nis intended to improve the likelihood that the\nDIF reserve ratio would reach the required\nminimum of 1.35 percent by the statutory\ndeadline of September 30, 2028.\n\nIn November 2023, the FDIC released a final\nrule to impose a special assessment to recover\nthe losses to the DIF resulting from failures\nof other banking institutions during 2023. The\nCompany expects the special assessments will\nbe tax deductible. As a result of this rule,\nin the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company\nrecognized additional noninterest expense of\n$734 million for the FDIC special assessment.\n\nDepositor Preference Under federal law, in the\nevent of the liquidation or other resolution\nof an insured depository institution, the\nclaims of a receiver of the institution for\nadministrative expense and the claims of\nholders of domestic deposit liabilities have\npriority over the claims of other unsecured\ncreditors of the institution, including\nholders of publicly issued senior or\nsubordinated debt and depositors in non-\ndomestic offices. As a result, those\ndebtholders and depositors would be treated\ndifferently from, and could receive, if\nanything, substantially less than, the\ndepositors in domestic offices of the\ndepository institution.\n\nOrderly Liquidation Authority Upon the\ninsolvency of a BHC, such as the Company, the\nFDIC may be appointed as conservator or\nreceiver of the BHC if the Secretary of the\nTreasury determines (upon the written\nrecommendation of the FDIC and the Federal\nReserve and after consultation with the\nPresident of the United States) that certain\nconditions set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act\nregarding the potential impact on financial\nstability of a financial company\u2019s failure\nhave been met. FDIC rules set forth a\ncomprehensive method for the receivership of a\ncovered financial company. Acting as a\nconservator or receiver, the FDIC would have\nbroad powers to transfer any assets or\nliabilities of a BHC without the approval of\nits creditors.\n\nResolution Plans The Company is required by\nthe Federal Reserve and the FDIC to submit a\nperiodic plan for the rapid and orderly\nresolution of the Company and its significant\nlegal entities in the event of future material\nfinancial distress or failure. If the Federal\nReserve and the FDIC jointly determine that\nthe resolution plan is not credible and such\ndeficiencies are not cured in a timely manner,\nthe regulators may jointly impose on the\nCompany more stringent capital, leverage or\nliquidity requirements or restrictions on the\nCompany\u2019s growth, activities or operations. If\nthe Company were to fail to address the\ndeficiencies in its resolution plan when\nrequired, it could eventually be required to\ndivest certain assets or operations. As a\nCategory III banking organization, the Company\nis required to submit resolution plans on a\ntriennial cycle (alternating between targeted\nand full submissions). The Company submitted\nits targeted resolution plan in December 2021\nand is scheduled to file its next full\nresolution plan in July 2024. In addition, in\nconnection with the MUB acquisition, the\nCompany committed to the Federal Reserve that\nit would, within six months of completing the\nacquisition of MUB, provide the Federal\nReserve and the FDIC with an interim update to\nits resolution plan. The Company submitted the\nupdate to its resolution plan within the\nrequired time period.\n\nIn August 2023, the Federal Reserve and the\nFDIC released proposed guidance for 2024 and\nsubsequent resolution plan submissions that\nwould apply to certain institutions including\nCategory III institutions such as the Company.\nThe guidance addresses the core elements of an\norganization's resolution strategy and is\nintended, among other things, to reduce\ninconsistencies in the amounts and types of\ninformation filed by different organizations.\nThe guidance is also intended to reflect the\nregulators' experience with bank failures that\noccurred during 2023. The effects on the\nCompany's resolution planning, including the\ntiming of submission, will depend on the final\nform of any guidance.\n                      11                      \nUSBNA is required to file periodically\nseparate resolution plans with the FDIC that\nshould enable the FDIC, as receiver, to\nresolve USBNA under applicable receivership\nprovisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nAct in a manner that ensures that depositors\nreceive access to their insured deposits\nwithin one business day of the institution\u2019s\nfailure, maximizes the net present value\nreturn from the sale or disposition of its\nassets and minimizes the amount of any loss to\nthe institution\u2019s creditors. In June 2021, the\nFDIC issued a Statement on Resolution Plans\nfor Insured Depository Institutions (the \u201cFDIC\nStatement\u201d). Among other things, the FDIC\nStatement established a three-year filing\ncycle for banks with $100 billion or more in\ntotal assets and provided details regarding\nthe content that filers will be expected to\nprepare. Under this filing cycle, USBNA\nsubmitted its most recent resolution plan to\nthe FDIC in November 2022. In August 2023, the\nFDIC issued a proposed rule that would require\ninsured depository institutions with $100\nbillion or more in total assets, such as\nUSBNA, to submit biennial resolution plans\nthat include a comprehensive strategy from the\npoint of potential failure to liquidation,\nwhich would be required to ensure timely\naccess to insured deposits, maximize value\nfrom the disposition of assets, minimize\nlosses to creditors and address potential\nrisks to the U.S. economy or financial\nstability. Under the proposed rule, USBNA\nwould be required to file resolution plans\nbiennially beginning in 2025. The effects of\nthe proposed rule on USBNA, including the\ntiming of submission, will depend on the final\nform of any rulemaking.\n\nIn addition, in connection with the approval\nby the OCC of the merger of MUB into USBNA,\nUSBNA committed (the \u201cOCC Commitments\u201d) to the\nOCC that it would (i) develop a list of\nbusiness lines and/or portfolios (each an\n\u201cobject of sale\u201d) that could be sold quickly\nin the event of stress; and (ii) prepare a\nplan, including a timeline, to effectuate such\nseparability, including through the\nestablishment of \u201cdata rooms\u201d for each object\nof sale. USBNA was required to submit these\nitems to the OCC for a written determination\nof no supervisory objection within six months\nof consummation of the merger of MUB into\nUSBNA. USBNA submitted all items within the\nrequired timeframe.\n\nRecovery Plans The OCC has established\nenforceable guidelines for recovery planning\nby insured national banks with average total\nconsolidated assets of $250 billion or more,\nincluding USBNA. The guidelines provide that a\ncovered bank should develop and maintain a\nrecovery plan that is appropriate for its\nindividual risk profile, size, activities, and\ncomplexity, including the complexity of its\norganizational and legal entity structure. The\nguidelines state that a recovery plan should,\namong other elements, (i) establish triggers,\nwhich are quantitative or qualitative\nindicators of the risk or existence of severe\nstress that should always be escalated to\nmanagement or the board of directors, as\nappropriate, for purposes of initiating a\nresponse; (ii) identify a wide range of\ncredible options that a covered bank could\nundertake to restore financial and operational\nstrength and viability; and (iii) address\nescalation procedures, management reports, and\ncommunication procedures. USBNA\u2019s recovery\nplan was reviewed and approved pursuant to\nthese guidelines in December 2023.\n\nTransactions with Affiliates There are various\nlegal restrictions on the extent to which the\nCompany and its non-bank subsidiaries may\nborrow or otherwise engage in certain types of\ntransactions with USBNA or its subsidiaries.\nUnder the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal\nReserve\u2019s Regulation W, USBNA and its\nsubsidiaries are subject to quantitative and\nqualitative limits on extensions of credit\n(including credit exposure arising from\nrepurchase and reverse repurchase agreements,\nsecurities borrowing and derivative\ntransactions), purchases of assets, and\ncertain other transactions with the Company or\nits other non-bank subsidiaries and\naffiliates. Additionally, transactions between\nUSBNA or its subsidiaries, on the one hand,\nand the Company or its other non-bank\nsubsidiaries and affiliates, on the other\nhand, are required to be on arm\u2019s length\nterms. Transactions between USBNA and its\naffiliates and the Company and its other non-\nbank subsidiaries and its affiliates must be\nconsistent with standards of safety and\nsoundness.\n\nAnti-Money Laundering and Sanctions The\nCompany is subject to several federal laws\nthat are designed to combat money laundering\nand terrorist financing, and to restrict\ntransactions with persons, companies, or\nforeign governments sanctioned by United\nStates authorities. This category of laws\nincludes the Bank Secrecy Act (the \u201cBSA\u201d), the\nMoney Laundering Control Act, the USA PATRIOT\nAct (collectively, \u201cAML laws\u201d), and\nimplementing regulations for the International\nEmergency Economic Powers Act and the Trading\nwith the Enemy Act, as administered by the\nUnited States Treasury Department\u2019s Office of\nForeign Assets Control (\u201csanctions laws\u201d).\n\nAs implemented by federal banking and\nsecurities regulators and the U.S. Department\nof the Treasury, AML laws obligate depository\ninstitutions and broker-dealers to verify\ntheir customers\u2019 identity, verify the identity\nof beneficial owners of legal entity\ncustomers, conduct customer due diligence,\nreport on suspicious activity, file reports of\ncertain transactions in currency, and conduct\nenhanced due diligence on certain accounts.\nSanctions laws prohibit United States persons\nand certain foreign affiliates from engaging\nin any transaction with a restricted person or\nrestricted country. Depository institutions\nand broker-dealers are required by their\nrespective federal regulators to maintain\npolicies and procedures in order to ensure\ncompliance with the above obligations. Federal\nregulators regularly examine BSA/Anti-Money\nLaundering (\u201cAML\u201d) and sanctions compliance\nprograms to ensure their adequacy and\neffectiveness, and the frequency and extent of\nsuch examinations and related remedial actions\nhave been increasing.\n\nIn January 2021, the Anti-Money Laundering Act\nof 2020 (\u201cAMLA\u201d), which amends the BSA, was\nenacted. Among other things, the AMLA codified\na risk-based approach to anti-money laundering\ncompliance for financial institutions;\n                      12                      \nrequired the development of standards by the\nU.S. Department of the Treasury for evaluating\ntechnology and internal processes for BSA\ncompliance; and expanded enforcement- and\ninvestigation-related authority, including a\nsignificant expansion in the available\nsanctions for certain BSA violations. Many of\nthe statutory provisions in the AMLA will\nrequire additional rulemakings, reports and\nother measures, and the impact of the AMLA\nwill depend on, among other things, rulemaking\nand implementation guidance. In June 2021, the\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau\nof the U.S. Department of the Treasury, issued\nthe priorities for anti-money laundering and\ncountering the financing of terrorism policy\nrequired under the AMLA. The priorities\ninclude corruption, cybercrime, terrorist\nfinancing, fraud, transnational crime, drug\ntrafficking, human trafficking and\nproliferation financing.\n\nCommunity Reinvestment Act USBNA is subject to\nthe provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of\nthe CRA, banks have a continuing and\naffirmative obligation, consistent with safe\nand sound operation, to help meet the credit\nneeds of their communities, including\nproviding credit to individuals residing in\nlow- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The\nOCC assesses USBNA on its record in meeting\nthe credit needs of the community served by\nUSBNA, including low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods. CRA assessments also are\nconsidered by the Federal Reserve or OCC when\nreviewing applications by banking institutions\nto acquire, merge or consolidate with another\nbanking institution or its holding company, to\nestablish a new branch office that will accept\ndeposits, or to relocate an office. In the\ncase of a BHC applying for approval to acquire\na bank or other BHC, the Federal Reserve will\nassess the CRA records of each subsidiary\ndepository institution of the applicant BHC,\nand those records may be the basis for denying\nthe application. USBNA received an\n\u201cOutstanding\u201d CRA rating in its most recent\nexamination, covering the period from January\n1, 2016 through December 31, 2020. Prior to\nmerging into USBNA, MUB received an\n\u201cOutstanding\u201d CRA rating in its most recent\nexamination, covering the period from January\n1, 2015 through December 31, 2018.\n\nIn October 2023, the OCC, together with the\nFederal Reserve and FDIC, issued a final rule\nto modernize the CRA regulatory framework. The\nfinal rule is intended, among other things, to\nstrengthen the achievement of the core purpose\nof the CRA, to adapt to changes in the banking\nindustry, including the expanded role of\nmobile and online banking, and to tailor\nperformance standards to account for\ndifferences in bank size and business models.\nThe final rule tracks the proposed rule issued\nby the agencies in May 2022 and adjusts CRA\nevaluations based on bank size and type, with\nmany of the changes applying only to banks\nwith over $2 billion in assets and several\napplying only to banks with over $10 billion\nin assets, such as USBNA. The final rule\nintroduces major changes to the CRA regulatory\nframework: (i) the delineation of assessment\nareas; (ii) the overall evaluation framework\nand performance standards and metrics; (iii)\nthe definition of community development\nactivities; and (iv) data collection and\nreporting. The final rule will become\neffective on April 1, 2024, but most\nprovisions of the rule will not become\napplicable until January 1, 2026. The Company\ncontinues to evaluate the effect of the final\nrule on USBNA, and any effects may depend on\nfurther guidance from the regulators with\nrespect to interpretive and implementation-\nrelated issues that may arise.\n\nRegulation of Brokerage, Investment Advisory\nand Insurance Activities The Company conducts\na broad range of securities activities, both\nretail and institutional, in the United States\nthrough U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., PFM\nFund Distributors, Inc. and U.S. Bancorp\nAdvisors, LLC (collectively, \u201cbroker-dealer\nentities\u201d). These activities are subject to\nregulations of the SEC, the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority and other authorities,\nincluding state regulators. These regulations\ngenerally cover licensing of securities\npersonnel, interactions with customers and\ncounterparties, trading operations, securities\nunderwriting compensation and arrangements,\ncustomer suitability, recordkeeping, reporting\nand communications. Securities regulators\nimpose capital requirements on the Company\u2019s\nbroker-dealer entities and conduct audits or\nother periodic reviews of their sales practice\nand financial operations. In addition, the\nCompany\u2019s broker-dealer entities are members\nof the Securities Investor Protection\nCorporation, which oversees the liquidation of\nmember broker-dealers that close when the\nbroker-dealer is bankrupt or in financial\ndistress and imposes membership fee\nassessments and other reporting requirements\non the broker-dealer entities.\n\nThe operations of the First American family of\nfunds, the Company\u2019s proprietary money market\nfund complex, also are subject to regulation\nby the SEC, including rules requiring a\nfloating net asset value for institutional\nprime and tax-free money market funds and\npermitting the board of directors of the money\nmarket funds the ability to limit redemptions\nduring periods of stress (allowing for the use\nof liquidity fees and redemption gates during\nsuch times). In July 2023, the SEC finalized\namendments to the rules that govern money\nmarket funds. These amendments will, among\nother things, increase liquidity requirements\nfor money market funds by requiring funds to\nhold greater proportions of their total assets\nin securities that can be liquidated in one\nbusiness day, and will require institutional\nprime and institutional tax-exempt money\nmarket funds to impose liquidity fees on\ninvestors that redeem their investments during\ntimes of stress.\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations in the areas of\ninsurance brokerage and reinsurance of credit\nlife insurance are subject to regulation and\nsupervision by various state insurance\nregulatory authorities, including the\nlicensing of insurance brokers and agents.\n                      13                      \nRegulation of Derivatives and the Swaps\nMarketplace Under the Dodd-Frank Act, USBNA,\nas a CFTC registered swap dealer, is subject\nto rules regarding the regulation of the swaps\nmarketplace and over-the-counter derivatives,\nincluding rules that require swap dealers and\nmajor swap participants to register with the\nCFTC, to meet robust business conduct\nstandards to lower risk and promote market\nintegrity, to meet certain recordkeeping and\nreporting requirements so that regulators can\nbetter monitor the markets, to centrally clear\nand trade swaps on regulated exchanges or\nexecution facilities, and to be subject to\ncertain capital and margin requirements. CFTC\nrules also require USBNA to be a member of the\nNational Futures Association, a self-\nregulatory organization with authority over\nswap dealers.\n\nIn addition, the OCC\u2019s rules concerning swap\nmargin and capital requirements for swap\ndealers regulated by the OCC mandate the\nexchange of initial and variation margin for\nnon-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-\nbased swaps between swap entities regulated by\nfive federal agencies and certain\ncounterparties. The amount of margin will vary\nbased on the relative risk of the non-cleared\nswap or non-cleared security-based swap. Other\nrules generally exempt inter-affiliate\ntransactions from initial margin requirements\nto the extent a depository institution\u2019s total\nexposure to all affiliates is less than 15\npercent of its tier 1 capital.\n\nThe Volcker Rule Section 13 of the BHC Act and\nits implementing regulations, commonly\nreferred to as the \u201cVolcker Rule,\u201d prohibit\nbanking entities from engaging in proprietary\ntrading, and prohibit certain interests in, or\nrelationships with, hedge funds or private\nequity funds. The Volcker Rule applies to the\nCompany, USBNA and their affiliates, and\ncompliance requirements are tailored based on\nthe size and scope of trading activities. The\nCompany has a Volcker Rule compliance program\nin place that covers all of its subsidiaries\nand affiliates, including USBNA.\n\nPrivacy and Data Protection Federal and state\nlaws contain extensive consumer privacy and\ndata protection provisions. The Gramm Leach-\nBliley Act (\u201cGLBA\u201d) requires financial\ninstitutions to periodically disclose their\nprivacy policies and practices relating to\nsharing nonpublic personal information and\nenables retail customers to opt out of the\nsharing of such information with nonaffiliated\nthird parties under certain circumstances.\nOther federal and state laws and regulations\nimpact the Company\u2019s ability to share certain\ninformation with affiliates and non-affiliates\nfor marketing and/or non-marketing purposes,\nor to contact customers with marketing offers.\nThe GLBA also requires financial institutions\nto implement a comprehensive information\nsecurity program. Security and privacy\npolicies and procedures for the protection of\npersonal and confidential information are in\neffect across all the Company\u2019s businesses and\ngeographic locations.\n\nData privacy and data protection are areas of\nincreasing legislative focus in the United\nStates, and several U.S. states have enacted\ncomprehensive consumer privacy laws that\nimpose compliance obligations with respect to\npersonal information. The Company has made and\nwill make operational adjustments in\naccordance with the requirements of applicable\nprivacy and data protection laws. For example,\nthe Company is subject to the California\nConsumer Protection Act of 2018 and its\nimplementing regulations, as amended in 2020\nby the California Privacy Rights Act (the\n\"CCPA\"), which provided residents of\nCalifornia with specific rights with respect\nto the collection of their personal\ninformation. The process of drafting and\nfinalizing implementing regulations for the\nCCPA is ongoing. The Company continues to\nevaluate the new regulations, and the effects\non the Company will depend on the form of any\nadditional rulemakings.\n\nSimilar comprehensive consumer privacy laws\nhave been adopted by other states where the\nCompany does business. Each of these state\nlaws, however, includes an entity level\nexemption for \u201cfinancial institutions\u201d that\nare subject to the GLBA like the Company. The\nUnited States Congress has also proposed\nlegislation relating to data privacy and data\nprotection, and the federal government may in\nthe future pass such legislation.\n\nIn addition, in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d),\nprivacy law is governed by the General Data\nProtection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which is\ndirectly binding and applicable in each EU\nmember state. The GDPR contains enhanced\ncompliance obligations and increased penalties\nfor non-compliance compared to the prior law\ngoverning data privacy in the EU and is\nregularly enforced by European regulators.\nCanada is in the process of replacing its\nfederal privacy law, the Personal Information\nProtection and Electronic Documents Act, with\na new privacy framework that the Company\nexpects will impose additional compliance\nobligations on the Company\u2019s Canadian\noperations.\n\nIn October 2023, the CFPB issued a proposed\nrule regarding personal financial data rights\nthat would apply to financial institutions\nthat offer consumer deposit accounts and\ncredit card issuers. Under the proposed rule,\nUSBNA would be required to provide consumers\nand their authorized third parties electronic\naccess to 24 months of transaction data,\ncertain account information, account balance,\nupcoming bill information, information to\ninitiate payment to and from accounts, and the\nterms and conditions under which an account or\ncredit card was provided. USBNA would be\nprohibited from imposing any fees or charges\nfor maintaining or providing access to such\ndata. USBNA would also be obligated to comply\nwith data accuracy, retention and other\nrequirements contained in the proposed rule.\nThe Company continues to evaluate the proposed\nrule, and the impact on USBNA and the Company\nwill depend on the final form of any\nrulemaking.\n\nLike other lenders, USBNA and other\nsubsidiaries of the Company use consumer\nreports in their underwriting activities. Use\nof such information is regulated under the\nFair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d), and the\nFCRA also regulates\n                      14                      \nreporting information to consumer reporting\nagencies, prescreening individuals for credit\noffers, sharing of consumer reports between\naffiliates, and using affiliate credit data\nfor marketing purposes. Similar state laws may\nimpose additional requirements on the Company\nand its subsidiaries. A significant overhaul\nof the FCRA is expected to be issued in the\nfirst half of 2024, which will impact USBNA\nand its subsidiaries.\n\nThe federal banking regulators, as well as the\nSEC, CFPB, CFTC, and related self-regulatory\norganizations, regularly issue guidance on\ncybersecurity that is intended to enhance\ncyber risk management among financial\ninstitutions. A financial institution\u2019s\nmanagement is required to maintain sufficient\nbusiness continuity planning processes to\nensure the rapid recovery, resumption and\nmaintenance of the institution\u2019s operations\nafter a cybersecurity incident. A financial\ninstitution is also expected to develop\nappropriate processes to enable recovery of\ndata and business operations if the\ninstitution or its critical service providers\nexperience a cybersecurity incident.\n\nIn November 2021, the United States federal\nbank regulatory agencies adopted a rule\nregarding notification requirements for\nbanking organizations related to significant\ncomputer-security incidents. Under the final\nrule, which was effective April 1, 2022, a\nbanking organization, such as the Company and\nUSBNA, is required to notify their primary\nfederal regulator within 36 hours of a\ncomputer-security incident that results in\nactual harm to the confidentiality, integrity,\nor availability of an information system or\nthe information that the system processes,\nstores or transmits, which has materially\ndisrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely\nto materially disrupt or degrade, the banking\norganization\u2019s ability to deliver services to\na material portion of its customer base,\njeopardize the viability of key operations of\nthe banking organization, or impact the\nstability of the financial sector. Similarly,\nthe Office of the Superintendent of Financial\nInstitutions in Canada requires Federally\nRegulated Financial Institutions to report\nqualifying technology and cybersecurity\nincidents under the provisions of the August\n13, 2021 Technology and Cyber Security\nIncident Reporting Advisory.\n\nConsumer Protection USBNA\u2019s retail banking\nactivities are subject to a variety of federal\nand state statutes and regulations designed to\nprotect consumers. These laws and regulations\nrequire, among other things, disclosures of\nthe cost of credit and terms of deposit\naccounts, provide substantive consumer rights,\nprohibit discrimination in credit\ntransactions, regulate the use of credit\nreport information, provide financial privacy\nprotections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and\nabusive practices and subject USBNA to\nsubstantial regulatory oversight. Violations\nof applicable consumer protection laws can\nresult in significant potential liability from\nlitigation brought by customers, including\nactual damages, restitution and attorneys\u2019\nfees, and may also result in significant\nreputational harm. USBNA\u2019s regulators may also\nseek to enforce consumer protection\nrequirements and obtain these and other\nremedies, including regulatory sanctions and\ncivil money penalties.\n\nUSBNA and its subsidiaries are subject to\nsupervision and regulation by the CFPB with\nrespect to federal consumer laws. The CFPB has\nundertaken numerous rule-making and other\ninitiatives, including launching an initiative\nto reduce the amounts and types of fees\nfinancial institutions may charge, including\nby recently proposing a rule that would\nsignificantly reduce the permissible amount of\ncredit card late fees, issuing informal\nguidance and taking enforcement actions\nagainst certain financial institutions. The\nCFPB\u2019s rulemaking, examination and enforcement\nauthority has affected and will continue to\naffect financial institutions that provide\nconsumer financial products and services,\nincluding the Company, USBNA and the Company\u2019s\nother subsidiaries. These regulatory\nactivities may limit the types of financial\nservices and products the Company may offer,\nwhich in turn may reduce the Company\u2019s\nrevenues.\n\nExecutive and Incentive Compensation\nGuidelines adopted by the federal banking\nagencies prohibit excessive compensation as an\nunsafe and unsound practice and describe\ncompensation as \u201cexcessive\u201d when the amounts\npaid are unreasonable or disproportionate to\nthe services performed by an executive\nofficer, employee, director or principal\nstockholder. The Federal Reserve has issued\ncomprehensive guidance on incentive\ncompensation policies (the \u201cIncentive\nCompensation Guidance\u201d) intended to ensure\nthat the incentive compensation policies of\nbanking organizations do not undermine safety\nand soundness organizations by encouraging\nexcessive risk-taking. The Incentive\nCompensation Guidance is based upon the key\nprinciples that a banking organization\u2019s\nincentive compensation arrangements should (i)\nprovide incentives that do not encourage risk-\ntaking beyond the organization\u2019s ability to\neffectively identify and manage risks; (ii) be\ncompatible with effective internal controls\nand risk management; and (iii) be supported by\nstrong corporate governance, including active\nand effective oversight by the organization\u2019s\nboard of directors. The Incentive Compensation\nGuidance states that enforcement actions may\nbe taken against a banking organization if its\nincentive compensation arrangements or related\nrisk-management control or governance\nprocesses pose a risk to the organization\u2019s\nsafety and soundness and the organization is\nnot taking prompt and effective measures to\ncorrect the deficiencies.\n\nDuring 2016, the federal bank regulatory\nagencies and the SEC proposed revised rules on\nincentive-based payment arrangements at\nspecified regulated entities having at least\n$1 billion of total assets. These proposed\nrules have not been finalized.\n\nIn October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule\ndirecting national securities exchanges and\nassociations, including the New York Stock\nExchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d), to implement listing\nstandards that require all listed companies to\nadopt policies mandating the recovery or\n\u201cclawback\u201d of excess incentive-based\ncompensation earned by a current or former\nexecutive\n                      15                      \nofficer during the three fiscal years\npreceding a required accounting restatement,\nincluding to correct an error that would\nresult in a material misstatement if the error\nwere corrected in the current period. The\nexcess compensation would be based on the\namount the executive officer would have\nreceived had the incentive-based compensation\nbeen determined using the restated financial\nstatements. The NYSE and other exchanges\nissued proposed standards in February 2023,\nwhich were approved by the SEC in June 2023.\nThe final standards became effective on\nOctober 2, 2023 and the Company adopted a\nclawback policy within 60 days after the\nNYSE's listing standard became effective, in\ncompliance with the NYSE's listing standard.\n\nClimate-Related Financial Risk Management In\nOctober 2023, the United States federal\nbanking agencies issued a set of principles\nrelating to the management of climate-related\nfinancial risks. The principles apply to\nbanking organizations with over $100 billion\nin total consolidated assets, including the\nCompany and USBNA. The principles are intended\nto provide a framework for large banking\norganizations to guide their efforts to\nidentify, measure, monitor, and mitigate\nphysical and transition risks associated with\nclimate change. Among other guidance, the\nprinciples describe how climate-related\nfinancial risks can be addressed in connection\nwith specific risk categories, including\ncredit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk,\nand legal and compliance risk.\n\nOther Supervision and Regulation As a public\ncompany, the Company is subject to the\nrequirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and the rules\nand regulations promulgated by the SEC\nthereunder, as administered by the SEC. As a\nlisted company on the NYSE, the Company is\nsubject to the rules of the NYSE for listed\ncompanies.\n                                              \n  Capital Covenants                           \n                                              \nThe Company has entered into several\ntransactions involving the issuance of capital\nsecurities (\u201cCapital Securities\u201d) by certain\nDelaware statutory trusts formed by the\nCompany (the \u201cTrusts\u201d), the issuance by the\nCompany of preferred stock (\u201cPreferred Stock\u201d)\nor the issuance by a subsidiary of USBNA of\npreferred stock exchangeable for the Company\u2019s\nPreferred Stock under certain circumstances\n(\u201cExchangeable Preferred Stock\u201d).\nSimultaneously with the closing of certain of\nthose transactions, the Company entered into a\nreplacement capital covenant, as amended from\ntime to time (as amended, each, a \u201cReplacement\nCapital Covenant\u201d and collectively, the\n\u201cReplacement Capital Covenants\u201d) for the\nbenefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a\nspecified series of long-term indebtedness of\nthe Company or USBNA (the \u201cCovered Debt\u201d).\nEach of the Replacement Capital Covenants\nprovides that neither the Company nor any of\nits subsidiaries (including any of the Trusts)\nwill repay, redeem or purchase any of the\nPreferred Stock, Exchangeable Preferred Stock\nor the Capital Securities and the securities\nheld by the Trust (the \u201cOther Securities\u201d), as\napplicable, on or before the date specified in\nthe applicable Replacement Capital Covenant,\nunless the Company has received proceeds from\nthe sale of qualifying securities that (a)\nhave equity-like characteristics that are the\nsame as, or more equity-like than, the\napplicable characteristics of the Preferred\nStock, the Exchangeable Preferred Stock, the\nCapital Securities or Other Securities, as\napplicable, at the time of repayment,\nredemption or purchase, and (b) the Company\nhas obtained the prior approval of the Federal\nReserve, if such approval is then required by\nthe Federal Reserve or, in the case of the\nExchangeable Preferred Stock, the approval of\nthe OCC.\n\nThe Company will provide a copy of any\nReplacement Capital Covenant to a holder of\nthe relevant Covered Debt upon request. For\ncopies of any of these documents, holders\nshould write to Investor Relations, U.S.\nBancorp, 800 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis,\nMinnesota 55402, or call (866) 775-9668.\n                      16                      \nThe following table identifies the closing\ndate for each transaction, issuer, series of\nCapital Securities, Preferred Stock or\nExchangeable Preferred Stock issued in the\nrelevant transaction, Other Securities, if\nany, and applicable Covered Debt as of\nFebruary 20, 2024, for those securities that\nremain outstanding.\n                                              \n                   Capit\u2026                     \n                   Secur\u2026                     \n                   Prefe\u2026                     \n  Clo\u2026    Issu\u2026    Stock     Other    Cover\u2026  \n  Date             or        Secu\u2026    Debt    \n                   Excha\u2026                     \n                   Prefe\u2026                     \n                   Stock                      \n                   USB                        \n                   Capit\u2026             U.S.    \n                   IX\u2019s      U.S.     Banco\u2026  \n          USB      $675,\u2026    Banc\u2026    7.50%   \n          Capi\u2026    of        Seri\u2026    Subor\u2026  \n  3/1\u2026    IX       6.189%    A        Deben\u2026  \n          and      Fixed\u2026    Non-\u2026    due     \n          U.S.     Rate      Perp\u2026    2026    \n          Banc\u2026    Normal    Pref\u2026    (CUSIP  \n                   Income    Stock    No.     \n                   Trust              91159\u2026  \n                   Secur\u2026                     \n                   U.S.                       \n                   Banco\u2026                     \n                   40,00\u2026                     \n                   Depos\u2026                     \n                   Shares                     \n                   ($25                       \n                   per                U.S.    \n                   Depos\u2026             Banco\u2026  \n                   Share)             7.50%   \n                   each               Subor\u2026  \n  3/2\u2026    U.S.     repre\u2026    Not      Deben\u2026  \n          Banc\u2026    a         Appl\u2026    due     \n                   1/100\u2026             2026    \n                   in a               (CUSIP  \n                   share              No.     \n                   of                 91159\u2026  \n                   Series                     \n                   B                          \n                   Non-C\u2026                     \n                   Perpe\u2026                     \n                   Prefe\u2026                     \n                   Stock                      \n                   USB                        \n                   Realty                     \n                   Corp.\u2026                     \n                   4,500                      \n                   shares                     \n                   of                         \n                   Fixed\u2026                     \n                   Excha\u2026                     \n                   Non-C\u2026             U.S.    \n                   Perpe\u2026             Banco\u2026  \n          USB      Series             7.50%   \n          Real\u2026    A                  Subor\u2026  \n  12/\u2026    Corp\u2026    Prefe\u2026    Not      Deben\u2026  \n          U.S.     Stock     Appl\u2026    due     \n          Banc\u2026    excha\u2026             2026    \n                   for                (CUSIP  \n                   shares             No.     \n                   of                 91159\u2026  \n                   U.S.                       \n                   Banco\u2026                     \n                   Series                     \n                   C                          \n                   Non-C\u2026                     \n                   Perpe\u2026                     \n                   Prefe\u2026                     \n                   Stock\u2026                     \n                                              \n(a) USB Realty Corp. is a subsidiary of USBNA.\n\n(b) Under certain circumstances, upon the\ndirection of the OCC, each share of USB Realty\nCorp.\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock will be\nautomatically exchanged for one share of U.S.\nBancorp\u2019s Series C Non-Cumulative Perpetual\nPreferred Stock.\n                                              \n  Available Information                       \n                                              \nU.S. Bancorp\u2019s internet website can be found\nat www.usbank.com.

Company is committed to managing risks\nthat may impact the Company and incorporating\nrisk considerations into its business\nactivities at all levels, including strategic\nplanning, risk identification inventory and\nassessment, and day-to-day business decisions.\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors has approved\na risk management framework that establishes\ngovernance and risk management requirements\nfor all the Company\u2019s key risk areas and risk-\ntaking activities. The Board oversees\nmanagement\u2019s performance relative to the risk\nmanagement framework and risk appetite.\nManagement is responsible for defining the\nvarious risks facing the Company, formulating\nrisk management policies and procedures, and\nmanaging risk exposures on a day-to-day basis.\nThe Company\u2019s Executive Risk Committee (ERC),\nwhich is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer,\noversees execution of the risk management\nframework. The ERC is supported by\nmanagement\u2019s senior operating committees, each\nresponsible for a specified risk category. The\nCompany\u2019s Information Security Risk Committee\n                      17                      \n(ISRC), which is co-chaired by the Chief\nInformation Security Officer (CISO) and the\nChief Technology Risk Officer, is a senior\noperating committee under this risk governance\nstructure and is responsible for the\nmanagement of information security risk at the\nCompany. The ISRC provides direction and\noversight of the information security risk\nmanagement framework and corporate control\nprograms of the Company, including significant\ninformation security risk events, and\nmitigation strategies. Further, the ISRC\nfacilitates communication across business\nlines to provide for effective and consistent\ninformation security risk identification and\ncontrol infrastructure to mitigate and manage\nmaterial information security risks. The ISRC\nserves as an escalation, decision making, and\napproval body for information security risk\nitems, including key policies and programs,\nissue resolution, emerging risks, and key\nprogram adherence. The ISRC escalates matters\nas appropriate to executive management, the\nERC, which reports to the Board\u2019s Risk\nManagement Committee, or a relevant committee\nof the Board. Generally, each of the ERC and\nISRC meet at least monthly.\n\nAs part of the Company\u2019s risk management\nframework, risk management programs and\nprocesses are in place to incorporate risk\nconsiderations into day-to-day business\nactivities across the Company\u2019s risk\ncategories, business lines, and functions.\nRisk programs may manage all or certain\ncomponents of a particular risk type. The\nCompany\u2019s cybersecurity risk program provides\ncentralized planning and management of related\nand interdependent work with a focus on risks\nfrom cybersecurity threats. The Company\u2019s\ncybersecurity risk program is integrated into\nthe Company\u2019s overall business and operational\nstrategies and requires that the Company\nallocate appropriate resources to maintain the\nprogram.\n\nThe Company\u2019s processes for assessing,\nidentifying, and managing material risks from\ncybersecurity threats is integrated into the\nCompany\u2019s overall risk governance and\noversight structures through its \u201cthree lines\nof defense\u201d model for establishing effective\nchecks and balances within the risk management\nframework. In this model, specific to\ncybersecurity threats, the first line of\ndefense is Information Security Services\n(ISS), which is responsible for identifying\nand implementing cybersecurity controls in\naccordance with policy requirements and\nindustry best practices, to meet regulatory\nrequirements and to safeguard the business.\nThe second line of defense, Cybersecurity Risk\nOversight within the Company's Operational\nRisk Management group, provides reporting and\nescalation of emerging risks related to\ncybersecurity and other concerns to senior\nmanagement, the ERC, the ISRC, other\ndesignated senior operating committees, and\nthe Risk Management Committee of the Board of\nDirectors. The third line of defense, the\nCompany\u2019s internal audit function, provides\nindependent assessment and assurance regarding\nthe effectiveness of the Company\u2019s governance,\nrisk management, and control processes with\nrespect to cybersecurity threats, and provides\nchallenge and recommendations for improvement.\n\nThe Company uses reporting and metrics\nframeworks and regular internal and external\noversight to assess the health of the\ncybersecurity risk program. At the first\nlevel, the ISS team identifies, assesses, and\nmanages cybersecurity risk and threats. The\nCompany manages cybersecurity issues and\nfindings through remediation and/or closure,\nwith escalation processes if an issue or\nfinding cannot be remediated within required\ntimeframes. The Company engages external\nassessors, consultants, and auditors to review\nthe Company\u2019s cybersecurity risk program\nagainst those of industry peers. The Company\nalso uses consultants periodically to provide\nrecommendations to improve and enhance the\nprogram. Additionally, the Company continually\nworks to align its policies and practices with\nindustry-accepted information security\npractices as provided by the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology\nCybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), Payment\nCard Industry Data Security Standards (PCI\nDSS), and other applicable standards, laws,\nand regulations.\n\nThe Company also maintains a third-party risk\nmanagement program responsible for the\noversight of outsourced operations, which\nenables the Company to oversee and identify\nrisks related to engaging third-party service\nproviders, including risks from cybersecurity\nthreats to third-party service providers. The\nCompany conducts due diligence using a risk-\nbased approach in selecting and monitoring\nthird-party service providers. The Company\nalso obtains contractual assurances from\nthird-party service providers relating to\ntheir security responsibilities, controls,\nreporting, and roles and responsibilities as\nit pertains to cybersecurity incident response\npolicies and notification requirements. As\nappropriate, the Company obtains independent\nreviews of the third parties\u2019 security through\naudit reports and testing and conducts\nverification and validation with third parties\nto confirm cybersecurity and information\nsecurity risks are appropriately identified,\nmeasured, mitigated, monitored, and reported\nby the third party to the Company.\n\nAs part of its responsibility to oversee the\nmanagement, business, and strategy of the\nCompany, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors\nreviews and approves the Company\u2019s risk\nmanagement framework annually through its Risk\nManagement Committee and oversees the\nCompany\u2019s risk management processes by\ninforming itself about the Company\u2019s key risks\nand evaluating whether management has\nreasonable risk management and control\nprocesses in place to address those risks. The\nBoard carries out its risk management\noversight responsibilities primarily through\nits committees. Each Board committee is\nresponsible for overseeing certain risks under\nits charter. The Board\u2019s Risk Management\nCommittee, with support from its Cybersecurity\nand Technology Subcommittee, has primary\noversight responsibility for cybersecurity\nrisk, including risks from any cybersecurity\nthreats. The Risk Management Committee\nmonitors the Company\u2019s compliance with the\nrisk management framework and risk limits\nestablished under the Company\u2019s risk appetite\nstatement approved by the Board. The Risk\nManagement Committee also oversees the\nCompany\u2019s independent risk management\nfunction. The Board\u2019s Risk Management\nCommittee has a Cybersecurity and Technology\nSubcommittee that provides dedicated oversight\nto\n                      18                      \ncybersecurity risk management and cyber\nresiliency and certain technology matters. The\nRisk Management Committee and its\nCybersecurity and Technology Subcommittee\nreceive quarterly reports from management on\ncybersecurity issues, including cybersecurity\nthreats. The Board\u2019s Risk Management Committee\nand Audit Committee also hold a joint meeting\nannually at which they receive a report from\nthe Company\u2019s CISO on cybersecurity threats\nfacing the Company and its preparedness to\nmeet and respond to those threats. In\naddition, the full Board typically holds an\nannual cybersecurity education session, which\nfeatures the perspective of an outside expert\non current cybersecurity topics. The Company\nalso typically conducts an annual executive-\nlevel cybersecurity exercise to test its cyber\nincident response, completeness of playbooks,\nand communication protocols. This exercise\ninvolves Board members, managing committee\nmembers, third-party companies, and regulators\nas appropriate.\n\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework\nincludes its risk appetite statement, which is\napproved annually by the Board\u2019s Risk\nManagement Committee and defines acceptable\nlevels of risk-taking and risk limits and\nestablishes the governance and oversight\nactivities over risk management and reporting.\nManagement monitors and measures the Company\u2019s\nrisk appetite using a quantitative risk\nscorecard, which consists of risk appetite\nmetrics and associated limits reported to the\nBoard\u2019s Risk Management Committee on a\nquarterly basis. The Company\u2019s risk appetite\nstatement includes specific information\nsecurity metrics and associated limits. These\nlimits also inform how matters, including\ncybersecurity incidents or threats, are\nescalated to specific members of management,\nappropriate senior operating committee\n(including the ISRC and/or ERC), and/or the\nBoard of Directors or appropriate Board\ncommittee. The Board\u2019s Risk Management\nCommittee oversees the Company\u2019s risk profile\nrelative to its risk appetite and compliance\nwith risk limits.\n\nThe members of the Company\u2019s management that\nare primarily responsible for assessing and\nmanaging risks from cybersecurity threats,\nincluding monitoring risk appetite metrics and\nlimits related to cybersecurity, include the\nCompany\u2019s CISO, Chief Risk Officer, and Chief\nInformation and Technology Officer.\n\nThe Company\u2019s CISO is primarily responsible\nfor the implementation of defense capabilities\nand risk mitigation strategies. The Company\u2019s\nCISO, Timothy J. Held, has over 26 years of\ninformation technology and cybersecurity\nexperience. He holds the title of Executive\nVice President and Chief Information Security\nOfficer and has been in his role since 2018,\nhaving served as the Company\u2019s Deputy CISO\nfrom 2015 to 2018 and Head of Cyber Defense,\nThreat Intelligence, and Incident Response\nfrom 2012 to 2018. The CISO is supported by\nhis direct reports and their teams, many of\nwhom hold cybersecurity-related\ncertifications.\n\nThe Company\u2019s CISO reports to the Vice Chair\nand Chief Risk Officer, Jodi L. Richard, who\nhas served in that position since October\n2018. She served as Executive Vice President\nand Chief Operational Risk Officer of the\nCompany from January 2018 until October 2018,\nhaving served as Senior Vice President and\nChief Operational Risk Officer from 2014 until\nJanuary 2018. Prior to that time, Ms. Richard\nheld various senior leadership roles at HSBC\nfrom 2003 until 2014, including Executive Vice\nPresident and Head of Operational Risk and\nInternal Control at HSBC North America from\n2008 to 2014.\n\nVenkatachari Dilip, the Company\u2019s Senior\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Information\nand Technology Officer, has oversight of\ntechnology-related risk management issues and\ncontrols that align to the NIST CSF. Mr. Dilip\npreviously was an Executive Vice President\nfrom September 2018 to April 2023 and has\nserved as Chief Information and Technology\nOfficer since joining the Company in September\n2018. From May 2014 until July 2017, he served\nas Vice President at McKinsey Digital where he\nhelped banks accelerate their digital\ntransformation. From April 2009 to September\n2013, he served as CEO at Compass Labs leading\nan innovative marketing analytics company.\nFrom March 2006 until April 2008, he served as\nDirector of Products at Google where he led\nproduct teams for mobile ads and Google\nCheckout. From March 2004 until March 2006, he\nserved as Vice President of PayPal/eBay and on\nthe Board of PayPal Europe, where he was\nresponsible for Payments Services, Risk and\nFraud Management. Previously, Mr. Dilip co-\nfounded and led startup companies CashEdge and\nCommerceSoft from 1996 until 2003.\n\nThe CISO and his leadership team generally\nmeet each business day to discuss security\nitem triage and emerging threats and trends\nidentified by the Threat Intelligence Team.\nThe CISO shares pertinent information from\nthose meetings with the Chief Risk Officer.\nDuring a cyber incident, which could involve\nthe Company or a third-party service provider\nto the Company, the Company\u2019s Cyber Security\nIncident Response Team (CSIRT) leads the\nresponse and internal communication. CSIRT\nmanages low and moderate severity incidents,\nand Enterprise Crisis Management manages high\nand very high severity incidents.
