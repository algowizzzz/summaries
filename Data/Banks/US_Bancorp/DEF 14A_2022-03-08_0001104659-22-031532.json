Board refreshment and nomination\nconsiderations Our Governance Committee\ncontinuously assesses the evolving\nopportunities and challenges facing our\ncompany in order to align the Board\u2019s\ncomposition with our company\u2019s leadership\nneeds and strategic direction. The Governance\nCommittee evaluates the composition of the\nBoard against the company\u2019s needs every year,\nwhich culminates in the process of nominating\nnew and incumbent directors. The Governance\nCommittee\u2019s decision to renominate an\nincumbent director is informed by the\ndirector\u2019s past attendance, participation in\nthe work of the Board and overall contribution\nto the Board, as assessed in the annual Board\nevaluation process. The Board\u2019s commitment to\nrefreshment can require candid conversations\nwith individual directors when the Governance\nCommittee has determined that a different\nBoard composition would increase the Board\u2019s\neffectiveness. As a result of the Board\nevaluation and skills-to-strategy alignment\nprocesses, directors may decide or be asked\nnot to stand for re-election at the next\nannual meeting. When a new director is sought,\nthe Governance Committee considers the\nfollowing factors:\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy              8    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 1 \u2014 Election of\ndirectors\n\n\u25b6 Professional skills and qualifications:When\nconsidering the skills and backgrounds\ndesirable in future Board members, the\nGovernance Committee identifies the\nprofessional experience and skill sets\nrepresented on the Board and compares them to\nthe set of skills that the Committee believes\nis important to have represented among the\ndirectors at any given time in light of the\ncompany\u2019s current strategy, risks and\nopportunities. Any gaps become focus areas for\ndirector search efforts. The Governance\nCommittee has identified certain skills,\nexperiences and professional qualifications\nthat are important to be represented on the\nBoard for strong collective oversight of the\ncompany\u2019s business and strategy. These skills\nand qualifications, along with the number of\nour nominees who possess them and the ways\nthese experiences contribute to the Board\u2019s\ncollective oversight of the development and\nexecution of the company\u2019s strategy, are as\nfollows:\n                                              \n      Sk\u2026                            Li\u2026      \n      or         #

Good corporate\ngovernance is vital to our continued success.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines to provide a corporate\ngovernance framework for our directors and\nmanagement to effectively pursue our\nobjectives for the benefit of our\nshareholders. The Board reviews and updates\nthese guidelines and the charters of the Board\ncommittees at least annually in response to\nevolving best practices and business needs, as\nwell as the results of annual Board and\ncommittee evaluations. Our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines can be found at\nusbank.com by clicking on \u201cAbout us\u201d,\n\u201cInvestor relations\u201d, \u201cCorporate Governance\u201d\nand then \u201cGovernance documents.\u201d Director\nindependence Our Board of Directors has\ndetermined that each of the following\ndirectors, comprising all of our current non-\nemployee directors, has no material\nrelationship with U.S. Bancorp and is\nindependent: Warner L. Baxter, Dorothy J.\nBridges, Elizabeth L. Buse, Kimberly N.\nEllison-Taylor, Kimberly J. Harris, Roland A.\nHernandez, Olivia F. Kirtley, Karen S. Lynch,\nRichard P. McKenney, Yusuf I. Mehdi, John P.\nWiehoff and Scott W. Wine. Andrew Cecere is\nnot independent because he is an executive\nofficer of U.S. Bancorp. Our Board has adopted\na set of standards in our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines to assist it in assessing the\nindependence of each of our non-employee\ndirectors. A director of U.S. Bancorp who\nmeets the independence qualifications of the\nNew York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) listing\nstandards may be deemed \u201cindependent\u201d by the\nBoard of Directors after consideration of the\nrelationships between U.S. Bancorp or any of\nits affiliates and the director or any of his\nor her immediate family members or other\nrelated parties. Our Board deems the following\nrelationships to be categorically immaterial\nsuch that they will not, by themselves, affect\nan independence determination: \u25b6 a\nrelationship between our company and an\norganization of which the director or a member\nof his or her immediate family is an executive\nofficer if that role does not constitute that\nperson\u2019s principal occupation; \u25b6 an ordinary\nbanking relationship for services readily\navailable from other large financial\ninstitutions; \u25b6 employment by our company of a\nmember of the director\u2019s immediate family if\nthat person\u2019s annual compensation does not\nexceed $120,000; and \u25b6 a relationship between\nour company and an organization with which the\ndirector or a member of his or her immediate\nfamily is affiliated if (a) the relationship\narises in the ordinary course of both parties\u2019\noperations and (b) the aggregate annual amount\ninvolved does not exceed $120,000. The only\nrelationships between U.S. Bancorp and our\ndirectors or the directors\u2019 related interests\nthat were considered by the Board when\nassessing the independence of our non-employee\ndirectors are the relationships between U.S.\nBancorp and each of Microsoft Corporation, a\ncorporation with which our director Yusuf I.\nMehdi is affiliated, and Oracle Corporation, a\ncorporation with which our director Kimberly\nN. Ellison-Taylor was affiliated during part\nof 2021. The Board determined that these\nrelationships, which are described later in\nthis proxy statement under the heading\n\u201cRelated Person Transactions,\u201d do not or did\nnot impair Mr. Mehdi\u2019s or Ms. Ellison-Taylor\u2019s\nindependence. This determination was based on\nthe Board\u2019s conclusion that the amounts\ninvolved in transactions between U.S. Bancorp\nand Microsoft or Oracle, as the case may be,\nare immaterial to Microsoft\u2019s and Oracle\u2019s\ngross revenues, respectively, and that the\nrelationships had no unique characteristics\nthat could influence Mr. Mehdi\u2019s or Ms.\nEllison-Taylor\u2019s impartial judgment as a\ndirector of U.S. Bancorp.\n                                              \n    17      U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance\n\nBoard leadership structure Board leadership\npolicies and practices Our Board believes that\na strong, independent Board of Directors is\ncritical to effective oversight of management.\nThe Board carefully considers the important\nissue of the best independent leadership\nstructure for the Board, and maintains a\nflexible policy regarding the issue of whether\nthe position of Chairman should be held by an\nindependent director. At least annually, the\nBoard reviews the Board\u2019s and company\u2019s needs\nand the leadership attributes of its directors\nand executives to determine whether our\ncompany is best served at that particular time\nby having the CEO or another director hold the\nposition of Chairman. In order to provide\nstrong independent Board leadership when the\nposition of Chairman is not held by an\nindependent director, the independent\ndirectors elect a Lead Director with the\nsubstantial leadership responsibilities\ndetailed below. The Lead Director is elected\nannually upon the recommendation of the\nGovernance Committee, with the expectation\nthat he or she will generally serve three, and\nmay serve up to five, consecutive terms. In\naddition to strong independent leadership of\nthe full Board, each of the Audit Committee,\nGovernance Committee, and Compensation and\nHuman Resources Committee is composed solely\nof independent directors. Independent\ndirectors, therefore, oversee critical, risk-\nsensitive matters such as the quality and\nintegrity of our financial statements; the\ncompensation of our executive officers,\nincluding the CEO; the nomination of\ndirectors; and the evaluation of the Board,\nits committees, and its members. Each of the\nremaining committees, aside from the Executive\nCommittee, is chaired by an independent\ndirector. The full Board and each of its\ncommittees meet in executive session on a\nregular basis. Current leadership structure\nAndrew Cecere, our President and Chief\nExecutive Officer, became Chairman of the\nBoard on the date of the 2018 annual meeting.\nOlivia F. Kirtley has served as the Board\u2019s\nindependent Lead Director since our 2020\nannual meeting. Chairman The independent\ndirectors believe that Mr. Cecere is the\nmember of the Board best suited to contribute\nto long-term shareholder value by serving as\nChairman because he has the knowledge,\nexpertise and experience to understand and\nclearly articulate to the Board the\nopportunities and risks facing our company and\nto lead discussions on important matters\naffecting our business.\n                                              \n      Role of Chairman                        \n      When the Chairman is also the CEO,      \n      that person\u2019s primary                   \n      responsibilities as Chairman are        \n      as follows:                             \n      \u25b6                                       \n      set Board meeting agendas in            \n      collaboration with the Lead             \n      Director, who has final approval        \n      authority over them;                    \n      \u200b                                        \n      \u25b6                                       \n      preside at Board meetings, guiding      \n      discussion and ensuring that            \n      decisions are made;                     \n      \u200b                                        \n      \u25b6                                       \n      ensure that the Board is provided       \n      with full information on our            \n      company and its industry;               \n      \u200b                                        \n      \u25b6                                       \n      set shareholder meeting agendas,        \n      subject to approval by the Board,       \n      and preside at meetings of the          \n      shareholders; and                       \n      \u200b                                        \n      \u25b6                                       \n      chair the Board\u2019s Executive             \n      Committee.                              \n      \u200b                                        \n                                              \nLead Director Ms. Kirtley brings deep business\nand board leadership experience to her role as\nLead Director of our Board.

As part of those requirements, our Board\nof Directors has determined that each member\nof the Audit Committee is financially\nliterate. All of the members of the\nCompensation and Human Resources, Governance,\nand Public Responsibility Committees also meet\nthe independence requirements of the NYSE,\nincluding, with respect to the Compensation\nand Human Resources Committee members, the\nNYSE\u2019s independence requirements specific to\nmembers of compensation committees. The Audit\nCommittee charter generally prohibits Audit\nCommittee members from serving on more than\ntwo other public company audit committees.\nCurrently, no Audit Committee member exceeds\nthis limitation. At all times, one or more\nmembers of our Audit Committee possess the\neducation or experience required to qualify as\nan \u201caudit committee financial expert\u201d as\ndefined by the SEC, and one or more members of\nour Risk Management Committee have experience\nidentifying, assessing and managing the risk\nexposures of large, complex financial firms,\nin accordance with rules promulgated by the\nFederal Reserve Board. Majority vote standard\nfor election of directors Our bylaws provide\nthat in uncontested elections, a nominee for\ndirector will be elected to the Board if the\nnumber of votes cast \u201cFOR\u201d the nominee\u2019s\nelection exceeds the number of votes cast\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d that nominee\u2019s election (votes to\n\u201cABSTAIN\u201d have no effect on the election of a\ndirector). The voting standard for directors\nin a contested election is a plurality of the\nvotes cast at the meeting. Our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines provide that director\nnominees must submit a contingent resignation\nin writing to the Governance Committee, which\nbecomes effective if the director fails to\nreceive a sufficient number of votes for re-\nelection at the annual meeting of shareholders\nand the Board accepts the resignation. The\nBoard will nominate for election or re-\nelection as director only candidates who have\ntendered such a contingent resignation. Our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines further\nprovide that if an incumbent director fails to\nreceive the required vote for re-election, our\nGovernance Committee will act within 90 days\nafter certification of the shareholder vote to\ndetermine whether to accept the director\u2019s\nresignation, and will submit a recommendation\nfor prompt consideration by the Board. The\nBoard expects the director whose resignation\nis under consideration to abstain from\nparticipating in any decision regarding his or\nher resignation.

The annual process\nis as follows: Based on director feedback\nreceived over the last several years through\nthis annual evaluation process and through\nless formal channels, including feedback\nprovided by directors at meetings, management\nhas adjusted the content and style of its\nwritten materials and oral presentations for\ncommittee meetings. In addition, the\nGovernance Committee has received information\nabout the skills and qualifications that\ndirectors would like future Board or committee\nmembers to have. Director feedback has also\nled to discussion of how to appropriately\nbalance oversight responsibility for critical\nmatters affecting our company among the Board\nand its committees, and how committee action\nis most effectively communicated to the full\nBoard.\n                                              \n    23      U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance\nDirector education It is important for our\ndirectors to continually receive additional\ninformation and training that will help them\nto effectively oversee the management of our\ncompany. We have implemented a robust director\neducation program that begins with in-depth\ntraining covering our industry and each of our\nlines of business, and that continues with\nspecial education sessions throughout the year\nthat highlight current business, industry,\nregulatory and governance topics presented by\ninternal and external experts. Directors are\nencouraged to attend continuing training\nsessions offered by outside providers on\ntopics related to general corporate governance\nas well as specialized areas in risk\nmanagement, audit, compensation and other\nmatters, at the company\u2019s expense. Shareholder\nengagement We value the views of our investors\nand welcome feedback from them. Our standard\nengagement practice is to initiate\nconversations with our largest investors each\nfall. In the fall of 2021, we reached out to\nour top 30 shareholders and invited them to\ntalk to us about corporate governance, our\nCOVID-19 response, our ESG practices,\nexecutive compensation and disclosure matters,\nand any other topics they wished to discuss.\nWe also consider requests for engagement from\nshareholders outside of the fall outreach\neffort. Management shares the feedback\nreceived from shareholders with the Governance\nCommittee, and feedback that relates to\nmatters that are specifically overseen by a\ndifferent Board committee are also provided to\nthose committees. The committees take the\nviews expressed by our shareholders into\nconsideration when making decisions.\nManagement also considers shareholder feedback\nabout disclosure practices when preparing our\ncompany\u2019s public filings. Conduct We are\ndeeply committed to maintaining the highest\nstandards of ethical conduct that reflect our\npurpose and core values. In recognition of\nthat commitment, for the seventh consecutive\nyear, we were named one of the World\u2019s Most\nEthical Companies\u00ae in 2021 by the Ethisphere\nInstitute.

Succession planning and management\ndevelopment A primary responsibility of the\nBoard is planning for CEO succession, as well\nas overseeing succession planning for other\nsenior management positions. The Board\u2019s\nprocess targets the building of enhanced\nmanagement depth and skills, considers\ncontinuity and stability within our company,\nand responds to our company\u2019s evolving needs\nand changing circumstances. To achieve these\ngoals, the executive talent development and\nsuccession planning process is integrated into\nthe Board\u2019s annual activities. The Governance\nCommittee has established a CEO succession\nplanning process that considers the profile\nand skills most critical to leadership of the\ncompany, includes ongoing evaluation of a\nnumber of potential internal and external\nsuccessor candidates, and addresses emergency,\ntemporary scenarios as well as long-term\nsuccession. The CEO makes available to the\nBoard his or her recommendations and\nevaluations of potential internal successors,\nalong with a review of any development plans\nrecommended for those individuals. The\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee is\nresponsible for reviewing succession planning\nfor executive officer positions other than the\nCEO.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy             24    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance Risk\noversight by the Board of Directors Board-\nlevel oversight of risk management structure\nAs part of its responsibility to oversee the\nmanagement, business and strategy of our\ncompany, the Board of Directors has approved a\nRisk Management Framework that establishes\ngovernance and risk management requirements\nfor all risk-taking activities. This framework\nincludes company-level and business unit Risk\nAppetite Statements that set boundaries for\nthe types and amount of risk that may be\nundertaken in pursuing business objectives and\ninitiatives. The Board of Directors oversees\nmanagement\u2019s performance relative to the Risk\nManagement Framework, Risk Appetite\nStatements, and other policy requirements.\nWhile management is responsible for defining\nthe various risks facing our company,\nformulating risk management policies and\nprocedures, and managing risk exposures on a\nday-to-day basis, the Board\u2019s responsibility\nis to oversee our company\u2019s risk management\nprocesses by informing itself about our\nmaterial risks and evaluating whether\nmanagement has reasonable risk management and\ncontrol processes in place to address those\nmaterial risks. The Board\u2019s risk oversight\nresponsibility is primarily carried out\nthrough its standing committees, as follows:\nThe Risk Management, Audit, and Capital\nPlanning Committees meet annually in joint\nsession to give each committee the opportunity\nto review the risk areas primarily overseen by\nthe other, and all Board members attend this\nmeeting to benefit from the discussion.\nFinally, at each meeting of the full Board of\nDirectors, each committee gives a detailed\nreport of the matters it discussed and\nconclusions it reached during its recent\nmeetings.\n                                              \n    25      U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance\n                                              \n      Focus on cybersecurity and climate      \n      risk                                    \n      The Board is very focused on the        \n      risks that cybersecurity threats        \n      and climate risk pose to our            \n      company as a major financial            \n      services institution.

In 2021, we\ncreated an ESG Program Office to develop and\nmanage our ESG strategy. In addition to the\ncreation of the program office, we enhanced\nour governance and oversight of ESG through\nthe creation of an ESG focused senior\noperating committee, dedicated to the\nintegration of ESG activities into our\nbusiness strategy. Managing our business in an\nenvironmentally and socially sustainable\nmanner is an important component of corporate\nresponsibility and critical to the success of\nour company. Our Board and management have\nshown a commitment to these matters by: \u25b6\nlaunching the U.S. Bank Access Commitment, a\nlong-term series of initiatives to address the\npersistent racial wealth gap and increase\nwealth building opportunities; and \u25b6\nannouncing several company-wide commitments to\naddress the impacts of climate change on our\nbusiness, customers and communities,\nincluding: \u2013 setting a goal to achieve Net\nZero greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 2050; \u2013\nsetting a goal to source 100% renewable\nelectricity within our operations by 2025 and\njoining RE100; \u2013 setting an environmental\nfinance goal of $50 billion by 2030; \u2013\naligning disclosures with the Task Force on\nClimate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\nrecommendations; and \u2013 joining the Partnership\nfor Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF),\ncommitting to measure and disclose financed\nemissions using PCAF standards.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy             26    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance Access\nto our ESG reports is provided for\ninformational purposes only and none of the\nESG reports, nor any other information\nincluded on our website, is incorporated by\nreference or otherwise made a part of this\nproxy statement. The COVID-19 pandemic The\nCOVID-19 pandemic is profoundly affecting our\ncustomers, our employees and the communities\nwe serve. At the onset of the pandemic, we\nactivated our crisis management plans, which\nare tested annually under the oversight of the\nBoard. The Board was highly engaged in\noverseeing management\u2019s pandemic response, and\nincreased its communications and interactions\nwith management as the crisis developed and as\nthe company adjusted its operations to provide\ncritical financial support, through both\nprivate and government programs, to our\ncommunities. As the crisis continues to\nevolve, our customers rely on us to provide\nessential financial services, and our\nemployees rely on us to provide a safe working\nenvironment. The Board has continued to\nactively monitor management\u2019s response to this\ncrisis. Management and the Board of Directors\nwill continue to actively oversee our response\nand the risks related to the COVID-19\npandemic. Management-level risk structure\nunderlying Board oversight Each Board\ncommittee carries out its risk management\nresponsibilities using reports from management\ncontaining information relevant to the risk\nareas under that committee\u2019s oversight. The\ncommittees must therefore be confident that an\nappropriate risk monitoring structure is in\nplace at the management level in order to be\nprovided accurate and useful informational\nreports. The management-level risk oversight\nstructure is robust. Our company relies on\ncomprehensive risk management processes to\nidentify, aggregate and measure, manage, and\nmonitor risks. This system enables the Board\nof Directors to establish a mutual\nunderstanding with management of the\neffectiveness of our company\u2019s risk management\npractices and capabilities, to review our\ncompany\u2019s risk exposure and to elevate certain\nkey risks for discussion at the Board level. A\nframework exists to account for the\nintroduction of emerging risks or any increase\nin risks routinely taken, which would either\nbe largely controlled by the risk limits in\nplace or identified through the frequent risk\nreporting that occurs throughout our company.\nThe Executive Risk Committee, which is chaired\nby our Chief Risk Officer and includes the CEO\nand other members of the executive management\nteam, oversees execution against the Risk\nManagement Framework and company-level Risk\nAppetite Statement. The Executive Risk\nCommittee meets monthly, and more frequently\nwhen circumstances merit, to provide executive\nmanagement oversight of our Risk Management\nFramework, assess appropriate levels of risk\nexposure and actions that may be required for\nidentified risks to be adequately mitigated,\npromote effective management of all risk\ncategories, and foster the establishment and\nmaintenance of an effective risk culture. The\nExecutive Risk Committee members manage large,\nsophisticated groups within our company that\nare dedicated to controlling and monitoring\nrisk to the levels deemed appropriate by the\nBoard of Directors and executive management.\nThese individuals, together with our company\u2019s\nController, Treasurer and others, also provide\nthe Board\u2019s committees with the information\nthe committees need and request in order to\ncarry out their oversight responsibilities.\nThe Executive Risk Committee focuses on\ncurrent and emerging risks, including\nstrategic, reputational and conduct risks,\ndirecting timely and comprehensive actions.\nThe following senior operating committees have\nalso been established to support the work of\nthe Executive Risk Committee, each responsible\nfor overseeing a specified category of risk: \u25b6\nthe Asset and Liability Management\nCommitteeensures that the policies, guidelines\nand practices established to manage our\nfunding and investment activities, interest\nrate risk, market risk, and liquidity risk are\nfollowed; \u25b6 the Capital Management Operating\nCommitteeprovides oversight of our programs\nrelated to stress testing, capital planning\nand capital adequacy, and resolution and\nrecovery, as well as oversight of our\ncompliance with capital regulation; \u25b6 the\nCompliance Risk Management Committeeprovides\ndirection regarding the management of\ncompliance risk to our company\u2019s business\nlines and risk management programs and shares\ninstitutional knowledge regarding compliance\nrisk management and mitigation across our\ncompany;\n                                              \n    27      U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance \u25b6 the\nDisclosure Committeeassists the CEO and the\nCFO in fulfilling their responsibilities for\noversight of the accuracy and timeliness of\nthe disclosures made by our company; \u25b6 the\nEnterprise Financial Crimes Compliance\nOperating Committeeis responsible for the\nmanagement and implementation of our company\u2019s\nenterprise financial crimes program across\nbusiness lines to ensure a consistent control\ninfrastructure and culture of compliance\nthroughout our company; \u25b6 the Enterprise IT\nGovernance Committeeoversees the distributed\nenterprise information technology environment\nand ensures that delivery of the company\u2019s\ninformation technology services is aligned\nwith our priorities and risk appetite; \u25b6 the\nExecutive Credit Management Group\nCommitteeensures that products that have\ncredit risk are supported by sound credit\npractices; reviews asset quality, trends,\nportfolio performance statistics and loss\nforecasts; and reviews and adjusts credit\npolicies accordingly; \u25b6 the Incentive Review\nCommitteereviews and evaluates our company\u2019s\nincentive compensation programs and policies\nfor risk sensitivity and mitigation; \u25b6 the\nMergers and Acquisitions Committeeis\nresponsible for the consideration and approval\nof all mergers, acquisitions and divestitures\nby our company; \u25b6 the Operational Risk\nCommitteeprovides direction and oversight of\nour company\u2019s operational risk management\nframework and corporate control programs,\nincluding cybersecurity and other significant\noperational risk events, and mitigation\nstrategies; \u25b6 the Strategic Investment\nCommitteeis responsible for our company\u2019s\nstrategic investments, including capital\nexpenditures, corporate real estate\ncommitments and other multi-year contractual\ncommitments, as well as our company\u2019s organic\ngrowth initiatives; and \u25b6 the Trust Management\nCommitteeprovides oversight of our fiduciary\nactivities. In addition, the Environmental,\nSocial and Governance Committeeis a sub-\ncommittee of the Executive Risk Committee and\nprovides clarity, direction, accountability,\nand oversight of ESG topics managed as part of\nexisting operations, programs and processes.\nOur Board and management-level committees are\nsupported by a \u201cthree lines of defense\u201d model\nfor establishing effective checks and\nbalances. The first line of defense, primarily\nthe revenue-generating business lines, manages\nrisks in conformity with established limits\nand policy requirements. In turn, business\nleaders and their risk officers establish\nprograms to ensure conformity with these\nlimits and policy requirements. The second\nline of defense, primarily the Chief Risk\nOfficer\u2019s organization, but also including the\npolicy and oversight activities of corporate\nsupport functions, translates risk appetite\nand strategy into actionable risk limits and\npolicies. The second line of defense monitors\nthe first line of defense\u2019s compliance with\nlimits and policies, and provides reporting\nand escalation of emerging risks and other\nconcerns to senior management and the Risk\nManagement Committee of the Board of\nDirectors.

The\nBoard has determined that the Governance\nCommittee does not need to review or approve\ncertain transactions even if the amount\ninvolved will exceed $120,000, including the\nfollowing transactions: \u25b6 lending and other\nfinancial services transactions or\nrelationships that are in the ordinary course\nof business and non-preferential, and comply\nwith applicable laws; \u25b6 transactions in which\nthe related person\u2019s interest derives solely\nfrom his or her services as a director of,\nand/or his or her ownership of less than ten\npercent of the equity interest (other than a\ngeneral partner interest) in, another\ncorporation or organization that is a party to\nthe transaction; \u25b6 transactions in which the\nrelated person\u2019s interest derives solely from\nhis or her ownership of a class of equity\nsecurities of our company and all holders of\nthat class of equity securities received the\nsame benefit on a pro rata basis; \u25b6\ntransactions where the rates or charges\ninvolved are determined by competitive bids,\nor that involve the rendering of services as a\ncommon or contract carrier, or public utility,\nat rates or charges fixed in conformity with\nlaw or governmental authority; and \u25b6\nemployment and compensation arrangements for\nany executive officer and compensation\narrangements for any director, provided that\nsuch arrangements have been approved by the\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee.\nWhen considering whether to approve or ratify\na transaction, the Governance Committee will\nconsider facts and circumstances that it deems\nrelevant to its determination, including: \u25b6\nthe nature and extent of the related person\u2019s\ninterest in the transaction; \u25b6 whether the\ntransaction is on substantially the same terms\nas those prevailing at the time for comparable\ntransactions with persons not affiliated with\nour company; \u25b6 the materiality of the\ntransaction to each party; \u25b6 whether our\ncompany\u2019s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct\ncould be implicated, including whether the\ntransaction would create a conflict of\ninterest or appearance of a conflict of\ninterest; \u25b6 whether the transaction is in the\nbest interest of our company; and \u25b6 in the\ncase of a non-employee director, whether the\ntransaction would impair his or her\nindependence. No director is allowed to\nparticipate in the deliberations or vote on\nthe approval or ratification of a transaction\nif that director is a related person with\nrespect to the transaction under review. On an\nannual basis, the Governance Committee\nassesses all ongoing relationships with\nrelated persons to confirm that the\ntransactions are still appropriate.\n                                              \n    29      U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Certain relationships and\nrelated transactions Related person\ntransactions Lending transactions During 2021,\nU.S. Bancorp and our banking and broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries engaged in transactions in the\nordinary course of business with some of our\ndirectors, executive officers and the persons\nthat we know beneficially owned more than 5%\nof our common stock on December 31, 2021, and\nthe entities with which they are associated.\nAll loans and loan commitments and any\ntransactions involving other financial\nproducts and services in connection with these\ntransactions were made in the ordinary course\nof business, on substantially the same terms,\nincluding current interest rates and\ncollateral, as those prevailing at the time\nfor comparable transactions with others not\nrelated to our banking and broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries and did not involve more than the\nnormal risk of collectability or present other\nunfavorable features. Transactions with\nentities affiliated with directors or\nexecutive officers Our director Kimberly\nEllison-Taylor served as the Executive\nDirector of Finance Thought Leadership for\nOracle Corporation until April 2021. During\n2021, we paid approximately $8 million to\nOracle for software, hardware and IT technical\nsupport services, including backend database,\nmiddleware and end-user applications. Oracle\u2019s\nannual revenue was approximately $40 billion\nfor fiscal year 2021. Our director Yusuf I.\nMehdi currently serves as a Corporate Vice\nPresident of Microsoft Corporation. During\n2021, we paid approximately $43 million to\nMicrosoft for software and services in the\nordinary course of business, including desktop\nsoftware, server and cloud enrollment\nservices, and support and development of\nproducts. Additionally, we have entered into a\nrelationship with Microsoft to purchase\ncertain cloud computing services. The\nrelationship consists of a cloud services\ncontract with a 6-year term and a variable\npayment amount based on our cloud service\nusage, and a 3-year implementation and\nmigration contract with fixed costs that are\ntied to achievement of milestones and paid\nover the course of the contract. The aggregate\ntotal payments over the term of the cloud\nservices relationship are expected to be\nbetween $200 and $300 million. No amounts were\npaid under these agreements in 2021.\nMicrosoft\u2019s annual revenue was approximately\n$168 billion for fiscal year 2021. These\ntransactions were conducted at an arm\u2019s length\nin the ordinary course of business by each\nparty to the transactions. As discussed above\nunder the heading \u201cDirector Independence,\u201d the\nBoard of Directors has determined that the\namounts involved in the transactions between\nU.S. Bancorp and Oracle or Microsoft, as the\ncase may be, are immaterial to Oracle\u2019s and\nMicrosoft\u2019s gross revenues, and that the\nrelationships had no unique characteristics\nthat could influence Ms. Ellison-Taylor\u2019s or\nMr. Mehdi\u2019s impartial judgment, and that Ms.\nEllison-Taylor and Mr. Mehdi are both\nindependent directors.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy             30    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nCompensation discussion and analysis This\nsection explains how we compensated the\nindividuals who served as our CEO or CFO for\n2021 and each of our three other most highly\ncompensated executive officers for 2021 (our\nnamed executive officers, or NEOs).

The Committee considers the high\nsupport for our recent Say on Pay votes \u2014 over\n94% in each of the last four years \u2014 as an\nendorsement from our shareholders that our\nexecutive compensation program is structured\neffectively. In light of this continued level\nof shareholder support, the Committee did not\nmake any structural changes as a result of the\n2021 Say on Pay vote. As discussed below, the\nCommittee did make modest adjustments to\ncertain compensation elements to ensure\ncontinued alignment of our executive\ncompensation program with shareholder value\nand company performance. 2021 performance-\nbased compensation results Payouts for NEOs\u2019\n2021 annual cash incentive awards ranged from\n142.6% to 145.4% of their respective target\namounts, based on strong earnings per share\n(EPS) and business line pretax income results\nfor the year, and the PRSUs granted in 2019\nwere earned at 113.6% of the NEOs\u2019 respective\ntarget amounts, based on absolute and relative\nreturn on equity (ROE) results for 2019-2021.\nCorporate financial performance In 2021, our\ncompany continued to demonstrate strong\nperformance relative to our financial peer\ngroup in the most commonly used performance\nmetrics for the banking industry.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy             32    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nElements of total direct compensation Sound\ncompensation practices Our executive\ncompensation program incorporates many strong\ngovernance features, including the following:\n                                              \n        What we do                            \n        Significant majority of each          \n        executive officer\u2019s                   \n        compensation is at risk               \n        \u200b                                      \n        We may cancel unvested equity         \n        awards and reduce cash                \n        incentive compensation for            \n        executives who demonstrate            \n        inadequate sensitivity to risk        \n        \u200b                                      \n        We have a clawback policy that        \n        allows us to recoup annual            \n        cash incentive payouts                \n        attributable to incorrectly           \n        reported earnings                     \n        \u200b                                      \n        We have meaningful stock              \n        ownership and                         \n        hold-until-retirement                 \n        requirements                          \n        \u200b                                      \n        The Committee retains an              \n        independent compensation              \n        consultant that provides no           \n        other services to our company         \n        \u200b                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n        What we don\u2019t do                      \n        Our executive officers do not         \n        have employment or                    \n        change-in-control agreements          \n        \u200b                                      \n        We do not allow executive             \n        officers to hedge or pledge           \n        their company stock                   \n        \u200b                                      \n        We do not have single-trigger         \n        accelerated vesting of equity         \n        awards upon a                         \n        change-in-control of the              \n        company                               \n        \u200b                                      \n        We do not provide tax                 \n        gross-ups (except in relation         \n        to relocation expenses)               \n        \u200b                                      \n        We do not pay dividends on any        \n        PRSUs that are not earned             \n        through satisfaction of the           \n        awards\u2019 performance metrics;          \n        dividends accrued on earned           \n        PRSUs are not paid until the          \n        awards vest                           \n        \u200b                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n    33      U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis Philosophy and objectives of our\nexecutive compensation program Compensation\nprogram objective The Committee has structured\nour executive compensation program to create\nlong-term shareholder value by attracting and\nretaining talented leaders and rewarding them\nfor top performance. The Committee achieves\nthis objective through a compensation program\nthat: \u25b6 links a significant portion of total\ncompensation to corporate and business line\nperformance metrics, which we believe will\ncreate long-term shareholder value; \u25b6 provides\ntotal compensation that is market competitive,\npermitting us to hire and retain high-caliber\nindividuals; \u25b6 emphasizes long-term, stock-\nbased compensation, encouraging our executive\nofficers to think and act as long-term\nshareholders; \u25b6 subjects equity awards to\nmulti-year performance, vesting and retention\nrequirements that enhance executive ownership\nand encourage a long-term view of corporate\nachievement; and \u25b6 encourages an appropriate\nsensitivity to risk on the part of senior\nmanagement, which protects long-term\nshareholder interests. Pay for performance We\noperate in a highly complex business\nenvironment and compete with both well-\nestablished financial institutions and,\nincreasingly, with non-banks offering products\nand services that traditionally were offered\nonly by banks. Our long-term business\nobjective is to maximize shareholder value by\nconsistently delivering superior returns on\ncommon equity that exceed the cost of equity.\nIf we are successful in achieving this\nobjective, the Committee believes the results\nwill benefit our shareholders. Accordingly,\nour executive compensation program is designed\nto reward our executives for achieving annual\nand long-term financial results that further\nour long-term business objectives. \u25b6 The\nannual cash incentive plan rewards performance\nrelative to corporate EPS and business line\npretax income targets established at the\nbeginning of the fiscal year, with\nconsideration of qualitative factors to\nsupport alignment with additional corporate\npriorities. \u25b6 NEOs earn PRSUs based on\nachievement of ROE targets over a three-year\nperiod, which directly measure the return\ngenerated by the company on shareholders\u2019\ninvestment. \u25b6 The ultimate value of both the\nPRSUs and RSUs earned by our NEOs is dependent\non our long-term financial success as\nreflected in the price of U.S. Bancorp stock.\nAt the same time, the Committee carefully\nweighs the risks inherent in our executive\ncompensation program against the goals of the\nprogram and the company\u2019s risk appetite.\nAdditional discussion of the risk oversight\nundertaken by the Committee can be found below\nunder \u201cDecision Making and Policies \u2014 Risk\nConsiderations.\u201d Pay levels When determining\nexecutive compensation levels each year, the\nCommittee considers the value of each\ncompensation element as well as the value of\nthe total direct compensation package. Key\nfactors that inform pay levels include the\nfollowing: \u25b6 a review of market data and the\ncompetitive landscape, which includes the\ncomplexity and size of U.S. Bancorp relative\nto its peer institutions and the comparability\nof an executive\u2019s responsibilities to\ncorresponding roles at peer institutions; \u25b6\nthe performance, experience and expertise of\nthe executive, including expanded scope of\nresponsibilities when applicable; \u25b6 internal\npay equity within the executive officer group;\n\u25b6 the company\u2019s strategy and performance; \u25b6\ncompensation actions applicable to the broader\nemployee base; and \u25b6 key talent succession\nplanning and retention considerations.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy             34    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nCompensation elements Our NEOs\u2019 total direct\ncompensation consists of three elements: base\nsalary, annual cash incentive compensation,\nand long-term incentive compensation\ncomprising 60% PRSUs and 40% RSUs. Each of\nthese elements of total direct compensation is\ndescribed in detail below. NEOs are also\neligible to receive health benefits under the\nsame plans and on the same terms available to\nour other employees, matching contributions to\ntheir U.S. Bank 401(k) Savings Plan accounts\non the same basis as our other employees, and\nretirement benefits that are earned over their\ncareer with the company. None of our NEOs have\nemployment or standalone change-in-control\nagreements. NEOs do not receive gross-up\npayments for tax liabilities resulting from\nperquisites, except in relation to relocation\nexpenses. Base salary Base salary is the only\ncomponent of the NEOs\u2019 total direct\ncompensation that is not at risk. The\nCommittee considers the salary of executive\nofficers relative to comparable executives in\nour compensation peer group and may make\nmarket-based adjustments as it deems\nappropriate. Salaries can also be adjusted to\nreflect experience and tenure in a position,\ninternal pay equity within the executive\nofficer group, promotions or increased scope\nof responsibilities, individual performance,\nand retention considerations. 2021 salary\nactions : The Committee made no changes to the\nNEOs\u2019 base salaries in 2021.\n                                              \n               20\u2026               20\u2026          \n    NEO        sa\u2026               sa\u2026          \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n    An\u2026        $    1,\u2026          $    1\u2026      \n    Ce\u2026                                       \n    Te\u2026                                       \n    R.         $    72\u2026          $    7\u2026      \n    Do\u2026                                       \n    Je\u2026                                       \n    H.         $    67\u2026          $    6\u2026      \n    von                                       \n    Gi\u2026                                       \n    Sh\u2026                                       \n    M.         $    65\u2026          $    6\u2026      \n    Ko\u2026                                       \n    Gu\u2026        $    65\u2026          $    6\u2026      \n    Ke\u2026                                       \n                                              \nAnnual cash incentive awards How we determine\nour NEOs\u2019 annual cash incentive awards All\nexecutive officers have the opportunity to\nearn annual cash incentive awards that reflect\ntheir responsibility levels and reward\nachievement of corporate and business line\ngoals.

The Committee believes that EPS\nand business line pretax income are\nappropriate performance metrics for the\nexecutive officers\u2019 annual cash incentive\nawards for the following reasons: \u25b6 EPS is a\ncommon metric used by investors to evaluate\nthe profitability of a company, showing the\nearnings (net income) we make on each\noutstanding share of common stock; \u25b6 a focus\non EPS supports alignment of the interests of\nthe executive officers with those of\nshareholders; \u25b6 EPS captures elements of\ncorporate performance that are beyond those of\nthe individual operating business lines, such\nas corporate funding policies and the\nmanagement and use of capital; \u25b6 the business\nline pretax income targets are the fundamental\ndrivers of the company\u2019s revenues and income\nbefore taxes; and \u25b6 the EPS and pretax income\ntargets are aligned with annual financial plan\ntargets, which the Board and management have\nassessed for achievability; accordingly, the\ntargets provide incentives to take appropriate\namounts of risk to achieve those goals. In\naddition, both EPS and business line pretax\nincome are used across the organization for\ncash bonus payout calculations, and using\nthese measures in executive officer incentive\naward calculations supports alignment with\ntheir areas of responsibility. Both the\nCorporate and Business Line Results are\nassessed relative to targets included in our\ncompany\u2019s annual financial plan. The Board\nestablishes these financial targets at the\nbeginning of the fiscal year with the intent\nthat they represent challenging, yet\nachievable, goals.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy             36    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis The Final Bonus Funding Percentage is\ncalculated as follows: \u25b6 Corporate Result:The\npercentage by which actual corporate EPS\ndiffers from the EPS target is multiplied by a\nleverage factor to magnify the positive or\nnegative variation from actual results,\nyielding the Corporate Result. A leverage\nfactor of two is applied to corporate\nachievement of EPS goals between 80% and 120%\nof target, and for any amount by which\ncorporate achievement of EPS goals is less\nthan 80% or more than 120%, the leverage\nfactor is 1:1. Prior to 2021, a leverage\nfactor of 4:1 was applied to the full extent\nto which actual results differed from target\nresults. In 2021, the Committee adjusted the\nleverage factor to provide a more balanced\nalignment with performance, and the change in\nleverage applies equally both above and below\ntarget. \u25b6 Business Line Result:A payout\ncomponent is calculated for each of our 17\nbusiness lines based on the percentage by\nwhich the business line\u2019s pretax income varies\nfrom target, using the same leverage factor as\nis applied to corporate performance. For\nexecutives with leadership responsibilities\nfor the entire company, including Messrs.\nCecere and Dolan, or for those with a\ncorporate-wide support function, including Mr.\nvon Gillern, the Business Line Result is based\non the weighted average of the pretax income\nresults of all the company\u2019s business lines.\nFor executives who lead a revenue-producing\ngroup, including Mr. Kotwal and Ms. Kedia, the\nBusiness Line Result is based on the weighted\naverage pretax income results of the business\nlines within the group that the executive\nleads. \u25b6 Each of the Corporate Result and the\nBusiness Line Result is multiplied by 50% and\nthen added together to arrive at the Formulaic\nBonus Funding Percentagefor each Named\nExecutive Officer. \u25b6 The Committee performs a\nQualitative Reviewof the Formulaic Bonus\nFunding Percentage, which includes a variety\nof broader performance factors to be\nconsidered when evaluating performance, as\ndescribed below. The results of the\nCommittee\u2019s assessment of these additional\nperformance factors allows the Committee to\nadjust the formulaic bonus calculation to\ncreate greater alignment with overall\norganizational performance if appropriate.\n2021 Corporate Result: The Corporate Result\nwas 150.6%, which was calculated as follows: \u25b6\nThe target level of EPS set by the Committee\nfor 2021 was $3.14. \u25b6 The company reported EPS\nresults of $5.03, which the Committee adjusted\ndownward by $0.93 for purposes of the\nCorporate Result to account for loan loss\nreserve variation and the notable items\ndescribed below. \u25b6 The resulting adjusted EPS\nvalue used to calculate the Corporate Result\nwas $4.10. \u25b6 The Corporate Result of 150.6%\nwas the outcome after applying the leverage\nfactor to the percentage difference between\ntarget and actual EPS results. For purposes of\ncomputing the Formulaic Bonus Funding\nPercentage for the Corporate Result, we adjust\nEPS to remove the impact of any variation in\nour loan loss reserve build or release on an\nafter-tax basis, while including net charge-\noffs to capture actual credit losses\nexperienced. The Committee established this\napproach at the beginning of 2020 in\nconnection with our adoption of the Current\nExpected Credit Losses (CECL) accounting\nstandard in January 2020, which created\n                                              \n    37      U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nsignificant potential accounting volatility\nand uncertainty with our loan loss reserve\nthat would be dependent upon a number of\njudgmental factors and economic assumptions.\nFor 2021, this calculation resulted in a\ndownward adjustment to reported EPS of $0.51.\nThe Committee also considers whether EPS\nshould be further adjusted from reported\namounts to normalize any notable items and\nwhether other normalizing adjustments should\nbe made to business line pretax income results\n.The 2021 EPS result was adjusted downward by\n$0.42 to eliminate the positive impact of\ncertain material items, including income from\nthe accelerated timing of loan forgiveness\nfrom the government\u2019s pandemic-relief Paycheck\nProtection Program, securities gains from\nrepositioning the investment portfolio, and\nreductions in certain corporate-level\npandemic-related liabilities as the economic\nenvironment improved, for a total EPS\nadjustment of $0.93. 2021 Business Line\nResults :For 2021, pretax income results,\ninclusive of the regular adjustments described\nabove, ranged from 98.0% to 202.6% of target\nperformance across our company\u2019s 17 revenue-\nproducing business lines. These results\ngenerated Business Line Results of 96% to 200%\nfollowing application of the leverage factor\nand the 0% floor and 200% ceiling. The\nweighted average Business Line Result of all\nthe company\u2019s business lines was 134.7%. For\nthe Business Line Result, pretax income\nincludes a component for changes in the loan\nloss reserve driven by loan balances and\nchanges in loan portfolio credit quality. The\nCommittee adjusts these results so that the\neffect of any variation in our loan loss\nreserve build or release driven by such\nchanges in loan portfolio credit quality is\nreduced by 50%. The Committee believes that\nthis adjustment serves to align bonus funding\nwith changes in credit quality while reducing\nsome of the volatility caused by variable\njudgmental factors. The Committee applies\nthese adjustments for loan loss reserve\nvariation consistently, whether the ultimate\nimpact is positive or negative, and believes\nthat such adjustments maintain accountability\nfor credit quality.

The Qualitative\nReview is based on the Committee\u2019s assessment\nof factors such as the company\u2019s progress\nagainst key strategic initiatives, additional\nrelevant financial performance metrics on an\nabsolute or relative basis, macroeconomic\nenvironment, and considerations related to ESG\nmatters including human capital management.\n2021 Qualitative Review actions: Based on its\nholistic consideration of corporate\nperformance, the Committee determined not to\nmake any adjustments to the formulaic bonus\nfunding outcome for 2021 based on the\nqualitative review. Factoring in individual\nperformance and risk sensitivity The Committee\nconsiders the performance of the business\nlines managed by each executive officer and\nthat executive officer\u2019s individual\nperformance during the year. The Committee\nalso uses a formal \u201crisk scorecard\u201d\nassessment, which can result in downward or\nupward adjustments to the Bonus Funding\nPercentage to reflect the executives\u2019\ndemonstrated sensitivity to risk. The\nCommittee believes that it is important to\nretain the ability to recognize outstanding\nindividual performance and risk mitigation in\ndetermining Annual Cash Incentive Payouts, as\nwell as to acknowledge circumstances where\nindividual performance improvements are\nsuggested or where inappropriate risk-taking\nbehaviors have occurred. Modifications to our\nNEOs\u2019 Bonus Funding Percentage based on their\nindividual performance and risk sensitivity\nhave been used only occasionally, however, and\nhave historically been modest in scope.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy             38    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis 2021 individual performance and risk\nsensitivity actions: The Committee determined\nthat each NEO\u2019s applicable Final Bonus Funding\nPercentage appropriately reflected that\nexecutive\u2019s performance and contribution to\nthe company in 2021. Accordingly, no\nindividual performance-based modifications\nwere made to the NEOs\u2019 Bonus Funding\nPercentages. Following an analysis of the\nNEOs\u2019 risk scorecard results, the Committee\ndid not make any risk-based modifications to\nthe NEOs\u2019 Bonus Funding Percentages. 2021\nAnnual Cash Incentive Payout results: The\nresulting payouts made to the NEOs in March\n2022 for 2021 performance under the AEIP were\nas follows: Long-term incentive awards\nEstablishing the structure of the equity\nawards Long-term, equity-based compensation\nrepresents the most significant portion of our\nNEOs\u2019 total compensation package. In 2021, 69%\nof our CEO\u2019s target total direct compensation\nand 63% of our other NEOs\u2019 target total direct\ncompensation (on average) consisted of equity\nawards. The Committee uses equity awards to\nalign the NEOs\u2019 interests with those of long-\nterm shareholders. The Committee grants equity\nawards to executive officers under the U.S.\nBancorp 2015 Stock Incentive Plan. In 2021,\n60% of the value of each executive officer\u2019s\nlong-term incentive award was granted in the\nform of PRSUs that will cliff vest (if earned)\non the third anniversary of the grant date,\nfollowing a three-year performance period, and\n40% was granted in the form of RSUs that vest\nratably over three years from the date of\ngrant. Cash dividends on unvested PRSUs accrue\nduring the performance period but are only\npaid at vesting on shares earned, if any, by\nthe executives. The mix of performance-based\nand time-based equity vehicles, with the mix\nmore heavily weighted toward performance-based\nequity, is designed to motivate achievement of\nfinancial objectives while encouraging\nretention and stock ownership. Setting the\nvalue of the equity awards Each year in\nJanuary, the Committee determines the dollar\nvalue of the long-term incentive awards to be\ngranted to the executive officers, with the\ngrants being made on a pre-determined date in\nFebruary or March. In setting each year\u2019s\naward amounts, the Committee considers the\nrelative market position of the awards and the\ntotal compensation for each executive, the\nproportion of each executive\u2019s total direct\ncompensation to be delivered as a long-term\nincentive award, internal pay equity,\nexecutive performance and changes in\nresponsibility, retention considerations, and\ncorporate performance. 2021 equity value\nactions: The Committee increased the value of\nthe long-term incentive awards granted to the\nNEOs in 2021 to align those NEOs\u2019 total\ncompensation more closely with the\nopportunities available to executives in\nsimilar roles at companies in our peer group.\n                                              \n    39      U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n                                              \n               Va\u2026               Va\u2026          \n               of\u2026               of\u2026          \n               aw\u2026               aw\u2026          \n               in                in           \n    NEO        20\u2026               20\u2026          \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n    An\u2026        $    8,\u2026          $    9\u2026      \n    Ce\u2026                                       \n    Te\u2026                                       \n    R.         $    3,\u2026          $    4\u2026      \n    Do\u2026                                       \n    Je\u2026                                       \n    H.         $    2,\u2026          $    3\u2026      \n    von                                       \n    Gi\u2026                                       \n    Sh\u2026                                       \n    M.         $    2,\u2026          $    2\u2026      \n    Ko\u2026                                       \n    Gu\u2026        $    2,\u2026          $    2\u2026      \n    Ke\u2026                                       \n                                              \nSelecting the performance metrics for the PRSU\nawards The number of PRSUs earned at the end\nof the three-year performance period is\ndetermined according to a formula that uses a\ncomparison of our actual ROE result to target-\nlevel ROE, as well as our ROE performance\nrelative to our peer financial institutions.\nROE is used as the performance metric because:\n\u25b6 it directly reflects the return generated by\nthe company on our shareholders\u2019 investment; \u25b6\nit encompasses profitability, efficiency,\nbalance sheet management and financial\nleverage, and is among the most widely used\nindicators of financial performance in our\nindustry; \u25b6 achieving a high ROE requires\nprudent management of the tradeoffs between\nrisk and return, requiring an appropriate\nbalance between achieving the highest return\non invested capital and managing risk within\nthe company\u2019s established risk tolerance\nlevels; and \u25b6 using ROE as a performance\nmetric aligns the interests of the executives\nwith those of long-term shareholders, because\nsustaining a high ROE is a primary driver of\nstrong earnings growth and long-term\nvaluation. The Committee uses a performance\nmatrix, illustrated below, that reflects both\nabsolute and relative ROE scales to determine\nthe final PRSU award amounts earned during the\nperformance period. Target levels of both\nabsolute and relative ROE are established,\nwith maximum and minimum levels also\nidentified. Earn-out amounts are determined\nusing straight-line interpolation. The\nCommittee believes that the PRSU earn-out\nstructure provides an important balance\nbetween rewarding the achievement of absolute\nperformance goals and strong relative\nperformance. Executives are not rewarded for\npoor performance simply because members of our\nfinancial peer group have even worse\nperformance, nor are they rewarded for\nexceeding expectations if performance relative\nto peers is substandard. In addition, by using\na sliding scale for each ROE performance\nmetric, the matrix takes into account the\namount of variance from the ROE target and\npeer group ROE results, rewarding performance\nwhile mitigating the incentive for excessive\nrisk taking that may result from an \u201call-or-\nnothing\u201d award. Setting the levels of absolute\nand relative ROE for the PRSU performance\nmatrix The target and maximum ROE levels\nselected by the Committee for the three-year\nperformance period contained in the PRSU\nawards granted each year are based on the ROE\nrange included in the company\u2019s profitability\ngoals announced at the last Investor Day\nconference held before the grant or changes to\nprofitability goals that are publicly\ncommunicated prior to the grant date. The\nCompany\u2019s ROE result may be adjusted from\nreported results to normalize the effect of\nsignificant notable items, e.g. merger-related\ncharges in the event of an acquisition\nintegration. Since 2020, ROE results include\nadjustments related to the impact of the CECL\naccounting standard. The adjustments eliminate\nthe volatility of the accounting standard\nrelated to changes in the allowance for credit\nlosses, while including net charge-offs\nrelated to actual credit losses experienced.\nThese CECL-related adjustments to the ROE\ncalculation for the PRSU awards were adopted\nby the Committee in January 2020, when we\nadopted the accounting standard. The Committee\nalso establishes a sliding scale of ROE\nachieved relative to the ROE of our financial\npeer group, which consists of the following\ninstitutions: Bank of America, Citizens, Fifth\nThird, J.P. Morgan, KeyCorp, PNC, Regions,\nTruist Financial, and Wells Fargo. This group\nis used by the company for financial\ncomparison purposes because these companies,\nalong with U.S. Bancorp, are the largest\nfinancial services companies based in the\nUnited States that provide broadly comparable\nretail and commercial banking services.

The\nCommittee has retained Meridian Compensation\nPartners, LLC (Meridian) as its independent\ncompensation consultant. Our CEO and senior\nmembers of our human resources function, with\nthe assistance of Meridian, develop initial\nrecommendations for all components of\ncompensation for the executive officers other\nthan the CEO and present their recommendations\nto the Committee for review and approval. The\nCommittee also annually reviews the total\namount and types of compensation paid to non-\nemployee members of the Board of Directors and\nrecommends any changes to the independent\ndirectors for approval. The Committee retains\nan independent compensation consultant to: \u25b6\nprovide advice regarding compensation program\ndesign, competitive practices, market trends,\nand peer group composition; \u25b6 provide\nperspectives and assist the Committee in\nsetting the pay of our CEO; \u25b6 provide the same\nadvisory services to the Committee, our CEO,\nand senior members of our human resources\nfunction regarding the compensation of the\nother executive officers; and \u25b6 advise the\nCommittee on non-employee director\ncompensation. Meridian does not provide any\nother services to our company. Following a\nreview of the relationship between the company\nand its independent compensation consultant in\n2021, the Committee concluded that Meridian\u2019s\nwork for the Committee did not raise any\nconflicts of interest.

Clawback and\nforfeiture provisions applicable to executive\nawards \u25b6 Clawback of paid cash awards: Under\nits clawback policy, the Committee will\nevaluate the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding any restatement of earnings, and\nin its sole discretion, may adjust and recoup\ncash incentive amounts paid to any executive\nofficer as it deems appropriate, if\nattributable to materially misleading reported\nearnings that require restatement. \u25b6\nForfeiture of unpaid cash awards: Payouts of\nannual cash incentive awards can be reduced to\n$0, regardless of company performance relative\nto plan metrics, if the executive officer has\ndemonstrated negative personal performance\nthat was significantly insensitive to risk\nduring the performance period. \u25b6 Cancellation\nof unvested equity awards: The equity award\nagreements for executive officers provide that\noutstanding awards can be canceled if the\nexecutive\u2019s conduct has subjected the company\nto significant financial, reputational or\nother risk through violations of company\npolicies, laws or regulations; negligent or\nwillful misconduct; or activity resulting in a\nsignificant or material control deficiency.\nChange-in-control provisions for executive\nofficers \u25b6 No cash benefit:The executive\nofficers are not entitled to receive any cash\npayments upon a change-in-control of our\ncompany, with or without a subsequent\ntermination in employment, except as provided\nby broad-based severance plans generally\navailable to our employees. \u25b6 No single-\ntrigger equity acceleration:The equity award\nagreements for executive officers provide that\na change-in-control of our company would not\ntrigger accelerated vesting of an executive\nofficer\u2019s outstanding equity awards unless his\nor her employment was involuntarily terminated\nwithin 12 months after the change-in-control\nother than for cause. Hedging and pledging\npolicy The company\u2019s Insider Trading Policy\nprohibits executive officers and directors of\nthe company from hedging shares of the\ncompany\u2019s common stock, including, but not\nlimited to, using prepaid variable forwards,\nequity swaps, collars and exchange funds. The\npolicy also prohibits executive officers and\ndirectors from pledging shares of the\ncompany\u2019s common stock as collateral for a\nloan or holding the company\u2019s common stock in\na margin account. Risk considerations\nOverview:Prudent risk taking is an integral\npart of any business strategy, and our\ncompensation program is not intended to\nencourage management decisions that completely\neliminate risk. Rather, the combination of\nvarious elements in our program is designed to\nencourage appropriate sensitivity to risk and\nmitigate the potential to reward risk taking\nthat may produce short-term results that\nappear in isolation to be favorable, but that\nmay undermine the successful execution of our\nlong-term business strategy and negatively\naffect shareholder value. Our compensation\npractices are also designed to\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy             44    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis reward performance while maintaining\nour core commitment to customer service and\nethical principles. Together with the\ncompany\u2019s processes for strategic planning,\nits internal control over financial reporting\nand other financial and compliance policies\nand practices, the design of our compensation\nprogram helps to discourage management actions\nthat demonstrate insensitivity to risk. Role\nof management:As a large financial services\ncompany, we are subject to ongoing regulatory\nreviews of incentive compensation policies and\npractices. We routinely undertake a thorough\nrisk analysis of every incentive compensation\nplan of the company, the individuals covered\nby each plan and the risks inherent in each\nplan\u2019s design and implementation. We also\nconduct validation and back-testing activities\nto ensure that compensation plans are\ncorrectly risk rated, the plans are designed\nto adequately mitigate risk inherent therein,\nand the plans are administered effectively.\nThe Incentive Review Committee was created to\noversee that review and to provide more\ncomprehensive oversight of the relationship\nbetween the various kinds of risk we manage\nand our company\u2019s incentive compensation plans\nand programs. The Incentive Review Committee\nmeets throughout the year and reviews and\napproves all company incentive plans. The\nIncentive Review Committee reviews incentive\nplan elements such as risk controls, plan\nparticipants, performance measures,\nperformance and payout curves or formulas, how\ntarget level performance is determined\n(including whether any thresholds and caps\nexist), how frequently payouts occur, and the\nmix of fixed and variable compensation that\nthe plan delivers. The plans and programs are\nalso reviewed from the standpoint of\nreasonableness (for example, how target pay\nlevels compare to similar plans for similar\nemployee groups at other companies, and how\npayout amounts relate to the results that\ngenerate the payments), how well the plans and\nprograms are aligned with the company\u2019s goals\nand objectives and with its risk appetite, and\nfrom an overall standpoint, whether these\nplans and programs represent an appropriate\nmix of short-term and long-term compensation.\nAs part of this review by the Incentive Review\nCommittee, our management team, including\nsenior risk officers and individuals from the\ncompensation department, have identified the\nrisks inherent in these programs and have\nmodified plans and controls where appropriate\nto mitigate certain potential risks. For\nexample, most business line incentive\ncompensation plans with a credit component\ntrack early defaults, or defaults that occur\nwithin the first 12 months, and must include a\nprovision that allows the company to offset\nfuture payments by the amount of the\npreviously paid incentives related to the\nearly default. In addition, a \u201crisk scorecard\u201d\nassessment measuring adequacy of risk\nmanagement is undertaken for senior\nmanagement-level employees who have the\nindividual ability to pose material risk to\nthe company, including the executive officers;\nall employees who have credit responsibility\nand who participate in annual corporate cash\nincentive plans; and all employees who, as\npart of a group, can engage in risk-taking\nbehavior that could be material to the company\nand who participate in annual corporate cash\nincentive plans. This analysis serves as the\nbasis for annual cash incentive plan\nadjustments for these employees. Annually, the\nIncentive Review Committee also addresses risk\nevents that pose a material adverse impact to\nthe company or business line to determine\nwhether an event should trigger cancellation\nof equity awards. The Incentive Review\nCommittee has reviewed its process with the\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee and\ndiscussed the areas where compensation-related\nrisks were being addressed by plan\nmodifications, or were mitigated by internal\ncontrols or otherwise. Role of the Board:The\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee\nalso conducts an annual review of the\ncompensation packages and components for the\nexecutive officers. The Committee assesses the\nincentives for risk taking contained in the\ncompensation program and balances them with\nthe other goals of the compensation program.\nIn evaluating the incentives for risk taking\nin compensation plans and policies for\nexecutive officers, the Committee considered\nthe following risk-mitigating aspects of those\nplans and policies:\n

Stock awards\nThe amounts in this column are calculated\nbased on the number of time-based restricted\nstock units, or RSUs, and performance-based\nrestricted stock units, or PRSUs, awarded and\nthe fair market value of U.S. Bancorp common\nstock on the date the award was made in\naccordance with Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification\n(ASC) Topic 718. See Note 18 to our\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nassumptions used to calculate our stock\nawards. The 2021 values in this table reflect\nthe fair market value of each officer\u2019s RSUs\nplus the target payout for the PRSUs on the\ngrant date. The number of PRSUs subject to\neach of these awards will be determined after\na three-year performance period beginning on\nJanuary 1, 2021 and ending December 31, 2023.\nDepending on our company performance during\nthe performance period, 0% to 150% of the\ntarget number of PRSUs granted to the NEOs\nwill be earned. The fair market value of RSUs\nplus the maximum potential payout amounts for\nthe PRSUs on the grant date were as follows:\n(i) Mr. Cecere, $12,740,000; (ii) Mr. Dolan,\n$5,200,000; (iii) Mr. von Gillern, $3,900,000;\n(iv) Mr. Kotwal, $3,640,000; and (v) Ms.\nKedia, $3,640,000. 2. Non-equity incentive\nplan compensation\nThe 2021 amounts in this column represent the\nAnnual Executive Incentive Plan, or AEIP,\nawards. Such amounts were determined in\nJanuary 2022 based on 2021 performance and\npaid out in March 2022. The AEIP and these\nawards are discussed above in the\n\u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d section\nof this proxy statement. 3. Change in pension\nvalue and non-qualified deferred compensation\nearnings\nThe amounts in this column represent the\nincrease in the actuarial net present value of\nall future retirement benefits under the U.S.\nBank Pension Plan and the U.S. Bank Non-\nQualified Retirement Plan. A number of factors\ncan cause the amounts reflected in this column\nto vary significantly, including volatility in\nthe discount rate applied to determine the\nvalue of future payment streams and changes to\nmortality assumptions. The change in present\nvalue amounts reported for 2021 is smaller\nthan those reported for 2020 for each NEO.\nThese smaller increases in value are due to\nthe rise in discount rates in 2021; year-end\n2021 rates were roughly 35 basis points higher\nthan for year-end 2020, compared with a\nroughly 70 basis point decrease from the prior\nyear. The values were partially offset by\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy             48    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\n\nincreases in pay, age and service. While Mr.\nCecere\u2019s increase is lower than for 2020, it\nis substantially higher relative to the other\nNEOs because his formula functions differently\nthan the other NEOs, and the magnitude of his\nbenefit is larger. The net present values of\nthe pension benefits as of December 31, 2021,\nused to calculate the net change in pension\nbenefits were determined using the same\nassumptions used to determine our pension\nobligations and expense for financial\nstatement purposes. See Note 17 to our\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for these\nspecific assumptions. Additional information\nabout our Pension Plan and Non-Qualified\nRetirement Plan is included below under the\nheading \u201cPension Benefits.\u201d We have not\nprovided above-market or preferential earnings\non any nonqualified deferred compensation and,\naccordingly, no such amounts are reflected in\nthis column. 4. All other compensation\nThe following table describes each component\nof the All Other Compensation column for 2021:\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \na. The amounts for Mr. Kotwal and Ms. Kedia\nrepresent expenses for corporate housing in\nMinnesota, air travel expenses related to use\nof aircraft fractionally-owned by the company,\nand related parking and ground transportation\nwhen commuting between their out-of-state\nresidences and our corporate headquarters in\nMinnesota. b. This amount represents a\nmatching contribution under our charitable\nmatching gifts program, which is available to\nall of our employees. In light of the health\nand safety risks caused by the COVID-19\npandemic and to ensure business continuity, in\n2021, Mr. Kotwal and Ms. Kedia were authorized\nto increase their use of corporate aircraft\nfor commuting between their out-of-state\nresidences and our corporate headquarters in\nMinnesota. Mr. Kotwal and Ms. Kedia did not\nuse the corporate aircraft for any personal\ntravel. The company anticipates less usage of\ncorporate aircraft for commuting purposes by\nits executives in 2022 as we return to more\nnormal business operations. The aggregate\nincremental cost for corporate-owned aircraft\nis determined by multiplying the total number\nof personal flight hours by the direct\nvariable operating costs of the aircraft per\nhour including costs related to fuel, landing\nand parking fees, and crew expenses. For\nfractionally-owned aircraft, the incremental\ncost is determined by multiplying the total\nnumber of personal flight hours by the\ncontracted hourly and fuel charges. As the\naircraft are used primarily for business\ntravel, we do not include fixed costs that do\nnot change based on usage, such as crew\nsalaries, aircraft acquisition costs and\nmonthly management fees for fractionally-owned\naircraft. Our NEOs are occasionally permitted\nto use sporting and cultural events tickets.\nAs such tickets were previously acquired by\nour company for business entertainment, there\nis no incremental cost to our company for the\nuse of such tickets.\n                                              \n    49      U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\n\nGrants of plan-based awards The following\ntable summarizes the equity and non-equity\nplan-based awards granted to the NEOs in 2021.\nGrants of plan-based awards for fiscal year\n2021\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n1.

Pension benefits Defined\nbenefit pension plans Our company sponsors two\ndefined benefit pension plans: the U.S. Bank\nPension Plan (the Pension Plan) and the U.S.\nBank Legacy Pension Plan (the Legacy Plan).\nThe Legacy Plan was established effective\nJanuary 1, 2020, to receive a transfer from\nthe Pension Plan of the accrued benefits of\nparticipants who terminated employment prior\nto January 1, 2020. The Legacy Plan and the\nPension Plan have substantively identical\nterms. If an employee whose pension was\ntransferred to the Legacy Plan is rehired, the\nemployee will participate in the Legacy Plan\non the same terms as the employee would have\nparticipated in the Pension Plan prior to the\ntransfer. Participation in the plans requires\none year of service with U.S. Bancorp or its\naffiliates, and substantially all employees\nare eligible to receive benefits thereunder,\nprovided that under no circumstance may an\nemployee participate in both plans. The\nPension Plan was created through the merger of\nthe former U.S. Bancorp\u2019s career average pay\ndefined benefit plan, the U.S. Bancorp Cash\nBalance Pension Plan (which we refer to as the\nOld Cash Balance Plan), and the former Firstar\nCorporation\u2019s non-contributory defined benefit\nplan, which was primarily a final average pay\nplan (the Firstar Plan). The Firstar Plan was\nfrozen to new-hire employees on July 3, 2008\nand to rehire employees on November 15, 2009.\nEmployees who were hired or rehired prior to\nJuly 3, 2008 or November 15, 2009,\nrespectively, could elect to (i) continue to\naccrue benefits under the final average pay\nformula of the Pension Plan, or (ii) accrue\nbenefits under the U.S. Bank 2010 Cash Balance\nPlan (the 2010 Cash Balance Plan), which\nrepresents the cash balance portion of the\nPension Plan. In the event of no election,\nparticipants defaulted into the 2010 Cash\nBalance Plan. Participants that elected to\nreceive pension benefits or defaulted into the\nCash Balance Plan had their existing benefits\nin the pension plan frozen and earn future\nbenefits under the cash balance formula, under\nwhich participants receive (i) annual pay\ncredits based on eligible pay multiplied by a\npercentage determined by their age and years\nof service, and (ii) an annual interest\ncredit. For participants who elected to\ncontinue to accrue benefits under the final\naverage pay formula, benefits are calculated\nusing a final average pay formula, based upon\nthe participant\u2019s years of service and average\nsalary of the five-consecutive-year period in\nwhich compensation was the highest during the\nten years prior to retirement. Normal\nretirement age is 65. Vesting of benefits\nrequires five years of service for benefits\nunder the final average pay formula and three\nyears of service for benefits under the 2010\nCash Balance Plan. Mr. Dolan is the only NEO\n(of those eligible at the time) who elected to\nremain covered by the final average pay\nformula; all other NEOs are covered by the\n2010 Cash Balance Plan.\n                                              \n    53      U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\nAlthough no new benefits accrued under the Old\nCash Balance Plan and Firstar Plan for service\nafter 2001, benefits previously earned under\nthose plans have been preserved and will be\npart of a retiree\u2019s total retirement benefit.\nIn order to preserve the relative value of\nbenefits that use the final average pay\nformula, subsequent changes in compensation\n(but not in service) may increase the amount\nof those benefits. Messrs. Cecere, Dolan and\nvon Gillern have earned benefits under the Old\nCash Balance Plan that will be included in\ntheir ultimate retirement benefits. Federal\nlaws limit the amount of compensation we may\nconsider when determining benefits payable\nunder qualified defined benefit pension plans.\nWe also maintain a non-contributory, non-\nqualified retirement plan (the U.S. Bank Non-\nQualified Retirement Plan, which we refer to\nas the Non-Qualified Plan) that pays the\nexcess pension benefits that would have been\npayable under our current and prior qualified\ndefined benefit pension plans if the federal\nlimits were not in effect. As part of her\ncompensation package, Ms. Kedia receives an\nadditional 23 years of service when\ncalculating her pay credits in the Non-\nQualified Plan. The additional years of\nservice represent her service with her prior\nemployer. Supplemental retirement benefits\nMessrs. Cecere, Dolan and von Gillern are\neligible for a supplemental benefit, which is\nalso paid under the Non-Qualified Plan, that\naugments benefits earned under the Pension\nPlan and the non-qualified excess benefits\ndiscussed above. The supplemental benefit\nensures that eligible NEOs receive a total\nretirement benefit equal to a fixed percentage\nof the NEO\u2019s final average cash compensation.\nFor purposes of this supplemental benefit,\nfinal average cash compensation includes\nannual base salary, annual cash bonuses and\nother cash compensation awards as determined\nby the Compensation and Human Resources\nCommittee. Eligibility for these supplemental\nbenefits has been determined by this committee\nbased on individual performance and level of\nresponsibility. Vesting of the supplemental\nbenefit is generally subject to certain\nconditions, including that an NEO provide a\ncertain number of years of service determined\nby the Compensation and Human Resources\nCommittee. Mr. Cecere is eligible for an\namount of total retirement benefits at age 65\nequal to 55% of the average cash compensation\nduring his final three years of service,\nreduced by his estimated retirement benefits\nfrom Social Security. Mr. Cecere is fully\nvested in his supplemental benefit. In the\ncase of Messrs. Dolan and von Gillern, their\nsupplemental benefits were frozen in 2001.\nAccordingly, Mr. Dolan has a frozen monthly\nannuity of $522, in which he is fully vested,\npayable as early as his termination date, and\nMr. von Gillern also has a frozen monthly\nannuity benefit of $138, in which he is fully\nvested, payable as early as his termination\ndate. In accordance with his election, Mr.\nCecere\u2019s supplemental benefit will be paid in\nthe form of a lump sum. For the supplemental\nbenefits payable to Messrs. Dolan and von\nGillern, the standard form is either a lump\nsum or a joint and survivor annuity, depending\non the present value of the lump sum at\nretirement. As the present value of the\nsupplemental benefit for Messrs. Dolan and von\nGillern is currently less than $400,000, in\naccordance with plan rules, their supplemental\nbenefit will default to payment in a lump sum.\nMessrs.

The measurement date and material actuarial\nassumptions applied in quantifying the present\nvalue of the current accrued benefits are\ndiscussed in Note 17 to our consolidated\nfinancial statements included in our 2021\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. These assumptions\ninclude the use of a 2.91% discount rate for\nthe supplemental and excess plans and a 3.09%\ndiscount rate for the qualified pension plan.\nThe mortality assumptions used are based on\nthe white-collar PRI-2012 mortality table\nprojected generationally using the MP-2021\nimprovement scale. The average pay used for\nthe benefit calculations was historical pay\nthrough the measurement date (December 31,\n2021). The amounts in this column were\ncalculated based on the earliest age at which\nthe applicable officer is entitled to receive\nunreduced retirement benefits and ignore any\nvesting requirements. The earliest age of\nunreduced retirement benefits is 65 for all\nour NEOs, and all are currently vested in 100%\nof their pension benefits. 2. In the event of\nthe death of one of the officers in this\ntable, a pre-established percentage of the\nofficer\u2019s pension benefits will be paid to the\nofficer\u2019s beneficiary. The actual percentage\npaid to the beneficiary is dependent on the\nform of payment of benefits elected by the\nofficer. The default percentage is 50% to the\nofficer\u2019s spouse. An additional lump sum death\nbenefit may be payable based on certain\nactuarial calculations. The present value of\nthe payments to an officer\u2019s beneficiary would\nnot exceed the total present value of\naccumulated benefits shown in this column,\nexcept as described in footnote 3 for Mr.\nCecere. 3. Mr. Cecere is 100% vested and\neligible to begin receiving his Pension Plan\nbenefit and the pre-2005 portion of his excess\nand supplemental benefits under the Non-\nQualified Plan upon retirement at any age. The\nremainder of his excess and supplemental\nbenefits are payable upon the later of age 62\nor retirement. If any of the vested benefits\nare paid before Mr. Cecere reaches age 65, the\nbenefits are reduced by certain early\nretirement benefit formulas specified in the\napplicable plan for\n                                              \n    55      U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\n\neach year prior to Mr. Cecere\u2019s reaching age\n65. These early retirement benefit formulas\nreduce the annual pension benefit amount\npayable to Mr. Cecere due to the longer\nbenefit payment period related to the earlier\ncommencement of benefits. Per the standard\nprovisions of the supplemental plan, upon his\nattainment of age 60, Mr. Cecere became\neligible for five accelerated years of service\ncredit for service to age 65. Mr. Cecere is\ncurrently eligible for four accelerated years\nof service credit, worth approximately $2.5\nmillion; this value will gradually be\nreflected in the table above and will have no\nextra value if he works to age 65. There is no\neffect on the applicable early reductions or\nbenefit timing noted above. Nonqualified\ndeferred compensation Under the U.S. Bank\nExecutive Employees Deferred Compensation Plan\n(2005 Statement) (the Executive Deferred\nCompensation Plan), members of our senior\nmanagement, including all of our NEOs, may\nchoose to defer all or a part of their annual\nbase salary and annual cash incentive\npayments. The minimum amount that can be\ndeferred in any calendar year is $1,000. Cash\ncompensation that is deferred is deemed to be\ninvested in one of several investment funds,\nincluding a U.S. Bancorp common stock fund, as\nselected by the participant.

Participants\nare allowed to change their investment\nelections at any time, but the changes are\nonly effective at the beginning of the\nfollowing calendar quarter. The measurement\nfunds are merely measuring tools to determine\nthe amount by which account balances will be\ndebited or credited to reflect deemed\ninvestment returns on deferred compensation.\nAlthough the plan administrator has\nestablished procedures permitting a\nparticipant to reallocate deferred amounts\namong these investment alternatives after the\ninitial election to defer, the election to\ndefer is irrevocable, and the deferred\ncompensation will not be paid to the\nparticipant until his or her retirement or\nearlier termination of employment. At that\ntime, the participant will receive, depending\nupon the payment choice and investment\nalternatives selected by him or her, payment\nof the amounts credited to his or her account\nunder the plan in a lump-sum payment or in\nannual installments over 5, 10, 15 or 20\nyears. Payments are made ratably in cash from\neach of the investment alternatives in which\nthe participant has a balance, except the U.S.\nBancorp stock fund, which is generally paid in\nshares. If a participant dies before the\nentire deferred amount has been distributed,\nthe undistributed portion will be paid to the\nparticipant\u2019s beneficiary in a single lump\nsum.

This amount was included in her\ncompensation reported in the Summary\nCompensation Table in our proxy statement for\n2018. Potential payments upon termination or\nchange-in-control General Any NEO whose\nemployment is voluntarily or involuntarily\nterminated is entitled to the payments or\nother benefits that have accrued and are\nvested under the benefit plans discussed above\nin this proxy statement. Except as is\nspecifically described below with respect to\ndisability, death or termination of employment\nfollowing a change-in-control (as defined in\nthe equity award agreements), no NEO is\nentitled to any other benefits upon any\nemployment termination or change-in-control\nscenario. Payments made upon disability Cash\npayments:Under the terms of the Non-Qualified\nPlan, Mr. Cecere is eligible for an annual\ndisability benefit that is equal to 60% of his\ncurrent annual cash compensation. The\ndefinition of disability is similar to that\nused for the broad-based disability program\ndescribed below. The definition of annual cash\ncompensation is the same definition as is used\nto calculate supplemental pension benefits\nunder this plan, without using a five-year\naverage. His agreement under the non-qualified\nretirement plan provides that Mr. Cecere is\neligible to receive disability payments\nthrough the earlier of the cessation of his\ndisability or reaching his normal retirement\nage. Messrs. Dolan, von Gillern, and Kotwal\nand Ms. Kedia are eligible for an annual\ndisability benefit of $150,000 (i.e. 50% of\nannual cash compensation, capped at $300,000\nof compensation) under the terms of the U.S.\nBank Long-Term Disability Insurance Plan\ninsured by Hartford Life and Accident\nInsurance Company, our broad-based disability\nprogram. Optional additional disability\ninsurance is available for purchase by those\nNEOs. The definition of disability is\ngenerally that a participant is unable to\nperform material duties of his or her own\noccupation for 24 months following the six-\nmonth elimination period, or any occupation\nafter 24 months, and suffers a loss of at\nleast 20% in predisability earnings. The\ndefinition of annual cash compensation is\nactual cash compensation for the one-year\nperiod ending September 30. The disability\nbenefit for any NEO would be reduced by any\nbenefits payable under the Pension Plan,\nSocial Security or worker\u2019s compensation. The\nduration of disability payments under this\nbroad-based program is dependent upon the age\nof the participant when the disability occurs.\nBecause each of Messrs. Dolan, von Gillern,\nand Kotwal and Ms. Kedia is under age 63,\npayments would continue through the earlier of\nthe cessation of their disability or reaching\ntheir normal retirement age, assuming all\nother plan conditions are met.\n                                              \n    57      U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\nEffect on equity awards:If any NEO\u2019s\nemployment is terminated due to disability,\nour equity award agreements provide that the\nvesting and other terms of those awards will\ncontinue as if the termination of employment\ndid not occur. No financial information for\nthe event of disability is set forth below in\nthe Potential Payments Upon Disability, Death,\nor Termination After a Change-in-Control table\nbelow for the equity awards held by our NEOs,\nas there is no immediate financial impact upon\nthe occurrence of this event. Payments made\nupon death Cash payments:NEOs are eligible to\nreceive life insurance benefits under the same\nplans available to our other employees. Their\nbenefit is equal to annual cash compensation,\ncapped at $300,000. In addition, optional term\nlife insurance is available for purchase. As\nthis benefit is generally available to all\nsalaried employees and does not discriminate\nin scope, terms, or operation in favor of the\nNEOs, the value has not been quantified in the\nPotential Payments Upon Disability, Death, or\nTermination After a Change-in-Control table.\nEffect on equity awards:Our equity award\nagreements provide for the acceleration of any\nunvested award upon death. For all RSUs and\nPRSUs, outstanding units will vest at target\nupon death. All of our NEO\u2019s stock options\nhave vested, and the stock option award\nagreements provide that the administrator of\nthe NEO\u2019s estate has a three-year period after\ndeath during which to exercise the options.\nPayments upon termination after a change-in-\ncontrol Cash payments:None of our NEOs is\nentitled to any cash payments in connection\nwith a change-in-control of U.S. Bancorp.\nEffect on equity awards:Our equity award\nagreements provide for the acceleration of\nvesting of any unvested award if an NEO\u2019s\nemployment is involuntarily terminated within\n12 months after a change-in-control of U.S.\nBancorp other than for cause (as defined in\nthe equity award agreements). All outstanding\nRSUs and PRSUs will vest at target upon a\nqualifying termination (as defined in the\nequity award agreements). All of our NEO\u2019s\nstock options have vested.

The\nratio stated above is a reasonable estimate\ncalculated in a manner consistent with Item\n402(u) of Regulation S-K. In making this pay\nratio disclosure, other companies may use\nassumptions, estimates, and methodologies\ndifferent than ours; as a result, the\nforegoing information may not be directly\ncomparable to the information provided by\nother companies in our peer group or\notherwise. Median employee identification and\ncompensation calculation We identified our\nmedian employee based on compensation paid\nduring 2020 to all of our U.S.-based\nemployees, other than our CEO, who were\nemployed by us on December 31, 2020. We\nconsidered any person to whom we delivered a\nForm W-2 Wage and Tax Statement (Form W-2) for\nservices performed in 2020 to be a U.S.-based\nemployee, which includes full-time, part-time,\nand temporary workers. For purposes of\ndetermining the compensation paid to the\nemployees under consideration, we used\nearnings subject to Medicare tax as reported\nin Box 5, \u201cMedicare wages and tips,\u201d on each\nemployee\u2019s 2020 Form W-2. We did not annualize\nthe compensation of anyone who was employed by\nus for only part of the year. The median\nemployee from 2020 is no longer employed by\nour company. . In accordance with Instruction\n2 to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we\nsubstituted a new median employee with\nsubstantially similar 2021 compensation as the\n2020 median employee for purposes of our pay\nratio disclosure. In accordance with the \u201c de\nminimis\u201d exemption provided in Item 402(u) of\nRegulation S-K, we excluded from consideration\nall of our non-U.S. employees. As of December\n31, 2021, we had 2,739 non-U.S. employees,\nrepresenting approximately 3.9% of our total\nU.S. and non-U.S. workforce of 70,268 active\nemployees on that date. The excluded employees\nwork in the following jurisdictions: Ireland\n(1,051), Poland (730), United Kingdom (502),\nCanada (194), Spain (113), Germany (49),\nLithuania (33), Luxembourg (29), Norway (28),\nSweden (9), and Cayman Islands (1).

Equity award for Board service during\nthe April 2021 \u2014 April 2022 term Each non-\nemployee director received an annual award of\nrestricted stock units with a grant date fair\nvalue of approximately $160,000 under the U.S.\nBancorp 2015 Stock Incentive Plan. This plan\nprovides that no non-employee director may\nreceive an equity award or awards with an\naggregate grant date fair value in excess of\n$600,000 in any calendar year. The restricted\nstock units were fully vested at the time of\ngrant, but the underlying shares will not be\ndelivered until the director ceases to serve\non the Board. Each non-employee director may\nelect to have all of his or her shares\ndelivered promptly following cessation of\nservice or to have the shares delivered in ten\nannual installments. Each non-employee\ndirector is entitled to receive additional\nfully vested restricted stock units having a\nfair market value equal to the amount of\ndividends he or she would have received had\nrestricted stock been awarded instead of\nrestricted stock units. Director stock\nownership requirements The Compensation and\nHuman Resources Committee has established\nstock ownership requirements for each non-\nemployee director equal to five times the\nvalue of the annual cash retainer. New\ndirectors must satisfy this minimum ownership\nlevel within five years of joining the Board.\nAs of December 31, 2021, all the directors\nwere in compliance with our stock ownership\nguidelines or were on track to be in\ncompliance by the end of his or her five-year\ncompliance period. Deferred compensation plan\nparticipation Under the U.S. Bank Outside\nDirectors Deferred Compensation Plan (2005\nStatement) (the Director Deferred Compensation\nPlan), our non-employee directors may elect to\ndefer all or a part of their cash fees. The\nminimum amount that can be deferred in any\ncalendar year is $1,000. Cash fees that are\ndeferred are deemed to be invested in one of\nseveral investment funds, including a U.S.\nBancorp common stock fund, as selected by the\nparticipant.

Administration of engagement\nof independent auditor The Audit Committee is\nresponsible for appointing, compensating,\nretaining and overseeing the work of our\nindependent auditor, including approving the\nservices provided by the independent auditor\nand the associated fees. The Audit Committee\nhas established a policy for pre-approving the\nservices provided by our independent auditor\nin accordance with the auditor independence\nrules of the SEC and the PCAOB. This policy\nrequires the review and pre-approval by the\nAudit Committee of all audit and permissible\nnon-audit services provided by our independent\nauditor and an annual review of the financial\nplan for audit fees. To ensure that auditor\nindependence is maintained, the Audit\nCommittee annually pre-approves the audit\nservices to be provided by our independent\nauditor and the related estimated fees for\nsuch services, as well as the nature and\nextent of specific types of audit-related, tax\nand other non-audit services to be provided by\nthe independent auditor during the year.

Ernst &\nYoung LLP began serving as our independent\nauditor for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2003. Our Audit Committee has carefully\nconsidered the selection of Ernst & Young LLP\nas our independent auditor, and has also\nconsidered whether there should be regular\nrotation of the independent external audit\nfirm. The Audit Committee annually reviews\nErnst & Young LLP\u2019s independence and\nperformance in connection with the committee\u2019s\ndetermination of whether to retain Ernst &\nYoung LLP or engage another firm as our\nindependent auditor. In determining whether to\nreappoint Ernst & Young LLP as U.S. Bancorp\u2019s\nindependent auditor, the Audit Committee took\ninto consideration a number of factors,\nincluding: \u25b6 the qualifications of Ernst &\nYoung LLP, the lead audit partner, and other\nkey personnel; \u25b6 the length of time the firm\nhas been engaged; \u25b6 the quality of the\nhistorical and recent performance on the U.S.\nBancorp audit; \u25b6 Ernst & Young LLP\u2019s\ncapability and expertise in handling the\nbreadth and complexity of our operations; \u25b6\nthe appropriateness of Ernst & Young LLP\u2019s\nfees on an absolute basis and as compared to\npeer firms; and \u25b6 the advisability and\npotential impact of selecting a different\nindependent audit firm. In accordance with SEC\nrules and company policies, lead and\nconcurring audit partners are subject to a\nmaximum of five years of service in that\ncapacity. The process for selecting the audit\nfirm\u2019s lead engagement partner involves\nmeetings with the candidates for the role by\nmanagement; review and discussion with the\nchair of the Audit Committee, who meets with\nselected candidates; and further discussion\nwith the full committee.

While we\nare not required to do so, we are submitting\nthe selection of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as\nour independent auditor for the 2022 fiscal\nyear for ratification in order to ascertain\nthe views of our shareholders on this\nappointment.

This proposal, commonly known as a\n\u201cSay-on-Pay\u201d proposal, gives our shareholders\nthe opportunity to express their views on the\ncompensation of our NEOs in accordance with\nSection 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended. We have been conducting\nannual advisory votes on executive\ncompensation since 2009 and expect to conduct\nthe next advisory vote at our 2023 annual\nmeeting of shareholders. We have designed our\nexecutive compensation program to create long-\nterm shareholder value by attracting and\nretaining talented leaders and rewarding them\nfor top performance.

This vote is not\nintended to address any specific item of\ncompensation, but rather our overall\ncompensation policies and procedures relating\nto our NEOs described in this proxy statement.\nAccordingly, your vote will not directly\naffect or otherwise limit any existing\ncompensation or award arrangement of any of\nour NEOs. Because your vote is advisory, it\nwill not be binding upon the Board of\nDirectors. However, the Board values our\nshareholders\u2019 opinions, and the Compensation\nand Human Resources Committee will take into\naccount the outcome of the vote when\nconsidering future executive compensation\narrangements.\n                                              \n        \u200b                             FOR      \n        The Board of Directors                \n        recommends that you vote              \n        \u201cFOR\u201d approval of the                 \n        compensation of our named             \n        executive officers, as                \n        disclosed in this proxy               \n        statement.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy             66    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Security ownership of\ncertain beneficial owners and management\n\nSecurity ownership of certain beneficial\nowners and management The following tables\nshow how many shares of our common stock were\nbeneficially owned as of February 4, 2022, by\neach current director and director nominee,\neach of the NEOs, all of our directors and\nexecutive officers as a group, and each person\nwho is known by us to beneficially own more\nthan 5% of our voting securities.

We have furnished the proxy\nmaterials to you over the Internet or mailed\nyou a printed copy of these materials because\nthe Board of Directors of U.S. Bancorp is\nsoliciting your proxy to vote your shares of\nour common stock at the annual meeting of\nshareholders to be held on April 19, 2022, or\nat any adjournments or postponements of the\nmeeting. What is a proxy? It is your\ndesignation of another person to vote stock\nyou own. That other person is called a proxy.\nIf you designate someone as your proxy in a\nwritten document, that document is also called\na proxy or a proxy card. When you designate a\nproxy, you also may direct the proxy how to\nvote your shares. We refer to this as your\n\u201cproxy vote.\u201d Andrew Cecere, our Chairman,\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, and\nLaura F. Bednarski, our Corporate Secretary,\nhave been designated as the proxies to cast\nthe votes of our shareholders at our 2022\nannual meeting of shareholders. What is the\npurpose of the meeting? At our annual meeting,\nshareholders will act upon the matters\noutlined in the notice of annual meeting of\nshareholders and described in this proxy\nstatement. Management will also report on our\n2021 performance and, once the business of the\nannual meeting is concluded, respond to\nquestions submitted in writing during or\nbefore the meeting.\n                                              \n      How can I access the proxy              \n      materials and vote my shares?           \n      The instructions for accessing the      \n      proxy materials and voting can be       \n      found in the information you            \n      received either by mail or e-mail.      \n      Depending on how you received the       \n      proxy materials, you may vote by        \n      Internet, telephone or mail.

In order to access this         \n      material and vote, you will need        \n      the 16-digit control number             \n      provided in the e-mail or on the        \n      notice. You may vote by following       \n      the instructions in the email, on       \n      the notice or on the website.           \n      \u200b                                        \n      \u25b6                                       \n      If you are a shareholder who            \n      received the proxy materials by         \n      mail:You may vote your shares by        \n      following the instructions              \n      provided on the proxy card or           \n      voting instruction form. If you         \n      vote by Internet or telephone, you      \n      will need the 16-digit control          \n      number provided on the proxy card       \n      or voting instruction form. If you      \n      vote by mail, please complete,          \n      sign and date the proxy card or         \n      voting instruction form and mail        \n      it in the accompanying                  \n      pre-addressed envelope.                 \n      \u200b                                        \n                                              \nHow do I vote if my shares are held in the\nU.S. Bank 401(k) Savings Plan? If you hold any\nshares in the U.S. Bank 401(k) Savings Plan,\nyou are receiving, or being provided access\nto, the same proxy materials as any other\nshareholder. However, your proxy vote will\nserve as voting instructions to the plan\ntrustee. Your voting instructions must be\nreceived at least five days prior to the\nannual meeting in order to count. In\naccordance with the terms of the plan, the\ntrustee will vote all of the shares held in\nthe plan in the same proportion as the actual\nproxy votes submitted by plan participants at\nleast five days prior to the annual meeting.\nWhy did I receive a notice regarding the\nInternet availability of proxy materials\ninstead of a printed copy of the proxy\nmaterials? In accordance with rules adopted by\nthe SEC, we are furnishing our proxy materials\nto our shareholders primarily over the\nInternet instead of mailing printed copies of\nthose materials to each shareholder. By doing\nso, we reduce costs and lessen the\nenvironmental impact of our proxy\nsolicitation. On or about March 8, 2022, we\nmailed a notice of Internet availability of\nthe proxy materials to most of our\nshareholders. The notice contains instructions\nabout how to access our proxy materials and\nvote online. This notice is not a proxy card\nand cannot be used to vote your shares. If you\nreceived a notice but would like to receive a\npaper copy of our proxy materials, please\nfollow the instructions on the notice. Our\nother shareholders, including shareholders who\nhave previously requested to receive paper\ncopies of the proxy materials and persons\nholding shares through our benefit plans,\nreceived paper copies of the proxy materials\ninstead of a notice. If you received paper\ncopies of the notice or proxy materials, we\nencourage you to sign up to receive all of\nyour future proxy materials electronically, as\ndescribed under \u201cHow can I receive my proxy\nmaterials by e-mail in the future?\u201d below.\n                                              \n    69      U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Questions and answers about\nthe annual meeting and voting Who is entitled\nto vote at the meeting? The Board has set\nFebruary 22, 2022, as the record date for the\nannual meeting. If you were a shareholder at\nthe close of business on February 22, 2022,\nyou are entitled to vote at the meeting. As of\nthe record date, 1,485,038,590 shares of our\ncommon stock were issued and outstanding and,\ntherefore, eligible to vote at the meeting.\nWhat are my voting rights? Holders of our\ncommon stock are entitled to one vote per\nshare. Therefore, a total of 1,485,038,590\nvotes are entitled to be cast at the meeting.\nThere is no cumulative voting. How many shares\nmust be present to hold the meeting? In\naccordance with our bylaws, shares equal to at\nleast one-third of the voting power of our\noutstanding shares of common stock as of the\nrecord date must be present at the meeting in\norder to hold the meeting and conduct\nbusiness. This is called a quorum. Your shares\nare counted as present at the meeting if: \u25b6\nyou have properly submitted a proxy vote by\nInternet, telephone or mail, even if you\nabstain from voting on one or more matters; or\n\u25b6 you hold your shares in street name (as\ndiscussed below) and you provide voting\ninstructions to your broker, bank, trust\ncompany or other nominee or you do not provide\nvoting instructions but your broker, bank,\ntrust company or other nominee uses its\ndiscretionary authority to vote your shares on\nthe ratification of the selection of our\nindependent auditor. What is the difference\nbetween a shareholder of record and a \u201cstreet\nname\u201d holder? If your shares are registered\ndirectly in your name with our transfer agent,\nComputershare Investor Services, you are\nconsidered the shareholder of record with\nrespect to those shares. If your shares are\nheld in a stock brokerage account or by a\nbank, trust company or other nominee, then the\nbroker, bank, trust company or other nominee\nis considered to be the shareholder of record\nwith respect to those shares. However, you\nstill are considered the beneficial owner of\nthose shares and your shares are said to be\nheld in \u201cstreet name.\u201d Street name holders\ngenerally cannot vote their shares directly\nand must instead instruct the broker, bank,\ntrust company or other nominee how to vote\ntheir shares using the voting instruction form\nprovided by it.

If you are a participant       \n      in the U.S. Bank 401(k) Savings         \n      Plan or hold your shares in street      \n      name, you may submit your vote as       \n      described above, but you may not        \n      vote your 401(k) Savings Plan           \n      shares or shares held in street         \n      name during the meeting.                \n                                              \nWhat if I am a shareholder of record and do\nnot specify how I want my shares voted? If you\nsubmit your proxy by Internet or submit a\nsigned proxy card and do not specify how you\nwant to vote your shares, we will vote your\nshares in accordance with the recommendations\nof the Board. Our telephone voting procedures\ndo not permit you to submit your proxy vote by\ntelephone without specifying how you want your\nshares voted. What if I hold my shares in\nstreet name and do not provide voting\ninstructions? If you hold your shares in\nstreet name and do not provide voting\ninstructions, your broker, bank, trust company\nor other nominee has discretionary authority\nto vote your shares on the ratification of the\nselection of Ernst & Young LLP as our\nindependent auditor. However, in the absence\nof your specific instructions as to how to\nvote, your broker, bank, trust company or\nother nominee does not have discretionary\nauthority to vote on any other proposal. Such\na situation results in a \u201cbroker non-vote,\u201d\nwhich does not have an effect on the outcome\nof the proposal. It is important, therefore,\nthat you provide instructions to your broker,\nbank, trust company or other nominee so that\nyour vote with respect to the other proposals\nis counted. What is the voting standard and\nwhat is the effect of abstentions? You may\nvote \u201cFOR,\u201d \u201cAGAINST\u201d or \u201cABSTAIN\u201d with\nrespect to each nominee for the Board of\nDirectors (Proposal 1), the ratification of\nthe selection of independent auditor (Proposal\n2), and the advisory vote on executive\ncompensation (Proposal 3).

Yes. You may\nrevoke your proxy and change your vote at any\ntime before your proxy is voted at the annual\nmeeting. If you are a shareholder of record,\nyou may revoke your proxy and change your vote\nby: \u25b6 voting again over the Internet or by\ntelephone by no later than 11:59 p.m., eastern\ntime, on April 18, 2022, or by submitting a\nproxy card with a later date and returning it\nso that it is received by April 18, 2022; \u25b6\nvoting again during the meeting; or \u25b6\nsubmitting written notice of revocation to our\nCorporate Secretary at the address shown on\npage 74 so that it is received by April 18,\n2022. To request an additional proxy card, or\nif you have any questions about the annual\nmeeting or how to vote or revoke your proxy,\nyou should write to Investor Relations, U.S.\nBancorp, 800 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, MN\n55402 or call 866.775.9668. If you hold your\nshares in street name, contact your broker,\nbank, trust company or other nominee regarding\nhow to revoke your proxy and change your vote.\nIf you are a participant in the U.S. Bank\n401(k) Savings Plan, you may revoke your proxy\nand change your vote as described above, but\nonly until 11:59 p.m., eastern time, on April\n14, 2022. Will my vote be kept confidential?\nYes. We have procedures to ensure that all\nproxies, ballots and voting tabulations that\nidentify shareholders are kept permanently\nconfidential, except as follows: to meet legal\nrequirements, to assert claims for or defend\nclaims against our company, to allow\nauthorized individuals to count and certify\nthe results of the shareholder vote if a proxy\nsolicitation in opposition to the Board takes\nplace, or to respond to shareholders who have\nwritten comments on proxy cards or who have\nrequested disclosure. We also have the voting\ntabulations performed by an independent third\nparty. Who will count the votes?\nRepresentatives of Broadridge Financial\nSolutions, Inc., our tabulation agent, will\ntabulate the votes and act as independent\ninspectors of election. Who pays for the cost\nof proxy preparation and solicitation? We pay\nfor the cost of proxy preparation and\nsolicitation, including the reasonable charges\nand expenses of brokerage firms, banks, trust\ncompanies or other nominees for forwarding\nproxy materials to street name holders. We\nhave retained Alliance Advisors, LLC, to\nassist in the solicitation of proxies for the\nannual meeting for a fee of $20,000, plus\nassociated costs and expenses. We are\nsoliciting proxies primarily by mail. In\naddition, our directors, officers and\nemployees may solicit proxies by telephone,\nfacsimile, e-mail or in person. They will not\nreceive any additional compensation for these\nactivities. Do we \u201chousehold\u201d annual meeting\nmaterials? The SEC rules allow a single copy\nof the notice of Internet availability of\nproxy materials or proxy statement and annual\nreport to be delivered to multiple\nshareholders sharing the same address and last\nname, or who we reasonably believe are members\nof the same family, and who consent to receive\na single copy of these materials in a manner\nprovided by these rules. This practice is\nreferred to as \u201chouseholding.\u201d Although we do\nnot household for our registered shareholders,\nwe understand that some brokers, banks, trust\ncompanies and other nominees household U.S.\nBancorp notices of Internet availability of\nproxy materials or proxy statements and annual\nreports, delivering a single copy of each to\nmultiple shareholders sharing an address\nunless contrary instructions have been\nreceived from the affected shareholders. Once\nyou have received notice from your broker,\nbank, trust company or other nominee that it\nwill be householding materials to your\naddress, householding will continue until you\nare notified otherwise or until you revoke\nyour consent. If, at any time, you no longer\nwish to participate in householding and would\nprefer to receive a separate copy of our\nnotice of Internet availability of proxy\nmaterials or proxy statement or annual report,\nor if you are receiving multiple copies of any\nof these documents and wish to receive only\none, please notify your broker, bank, trust\ncompany or other nominee. We will deliver\npromptly upon written or oral request a\nseparate copy of our notice of Internet\navailability of proxy materials, proxy\nstatement and/or our annual report to a\nshareholder at a shared address to which a\nsingle copy was delivered. For copies of any\nof these documents, shareholders should write\nto Investor Relations, U.S. Bancorp, BC-\nMN-H23K, 800 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis,\nMinnesota 55402, or call 866.775.9668.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2022 Proxy             72    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Questions and answers about\nthe annual meeting and voting\n\nHow can I receive my proxy materials by e-mail\nin the future? Instead of receiving future\npaper copies of the notice of Internet\navailability of proxy materials or our proxy\nmaterials by mail, you can elect to receive an\ne-mail with links to these documents, your\ncontrol number and instructions for voting\nover the Internet.
