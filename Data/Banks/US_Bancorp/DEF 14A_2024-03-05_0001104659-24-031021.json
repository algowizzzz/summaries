That commitment was important to\nour success in 2023, especially as our\nindustry faced tremendous stress and scrutiny\ngiven the market disruption that occurred\nearly in the year. Strength, stability and\nsecurity were paramount. Demonstrating that we\nnot only had a plan for the future but also\nwere ready to respond in the moment was key.\nThose who were resilient stood apart, and we\nwere among them. There is a lot to be proud of\nas we look back on 2023. You will read about\nmany of those accomplishments in the pages of\nthis year\u2019s proxy statement and our companion\nAnnual Report. At a high level: we\nsuccessfully converted and integrated our\nacquisition of MUFG Union Bank. We continued\nto make investments in products, services and\nour differentiating payments ecosystem. We\ndeepened relationships with existing clients\nand expanded our reach to new customers across\nour entire network and each of our businesses.\nWe strengthened our digital capabilities and\nmodernized our technology. We extended our\nsupport to communities where we live and work\nthrough our Community Benefits Plan and\nongoing corporate social responsibility\nefforts. Further, we enhanced our discipline\nin risk and financial management \u2014 and\nnotably, quickly rebuilt capital following our\nUnion Bank transaction by implementing a\nnumber of balance sheet optimization\ninitiatives, and by taking advantage of our\nnewly expanded scope and realizing acquisition\nsynergies. Our team of our more than 70,000\nemployees remained focused on doing the right\nthing every day and continued to meet the\nchanging needs of our customers. That\ndedication to excellence, to the future, and\nto each other enabled us to move forward\nconfidently in a challenging time. There is a\nlot of opportunity ahead, and I am proud of\nthe work this team will do in service to you.\nAs always, thank you for the trust you place\nin us as shareholders of our company.\nSincerely, Andrew Cecere\nChairman, President and Chief Executive\nOfficer March 5, 2024\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy                   \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS A message from our Lead\nIndependent Director Fellow shareholders: It\nis a great honor to serve as the Lead\nIndependent Director of our Board of\nDirectors. In this role, I have the privilege\nof working closely with the other independent\ndirectors on the Board and the executive team.\nAs a Board, we actively engaged with\nmanagement as the company navigated the\nchallenges and opportunities presented in\n2023. Importantly during this period, U.S.\nBank demonstrated its strength and stability\nwhile continuing to support our clients,\nemployees and communities. With the addition\nof four new directors over the last four\nyears, our experienced Board brought a wide\nrange of skills, experience and diverse\nperspectives as we supported and\nconstructively challenged the company\u2019s\nstrategy and management decisions. This past\nyear was eventful, and we oversaw the\nsuccessful integration and conversion of MUFG\nUnion Bank, our continued investments in\ntechnology and innovation, and our response to\nmarket disruption in the banking sector. We\nalso oversaw management\u2019s execution of prudent\nbalance sheet positioning actions, our capital\nstrategy, and our risk and control\ninfrastructure. During 2023, the Board\nreviewed its structure and committee oversight\nresponsibilities, and we made changes to\noptimize risk oversight related to capital,\nliquidity and interest rates. We believe these\nchanges will position us well to navigate a\ndynamic economic environment and best serve\nour shareholders and other relevant\nconstituencies. I also am proud of the work\nthat U.S. Bancorp does in support of the\ncommunities where we do business. For\ninstance, we had the unique opportunity during\nthe past two years to oversee the company\u2019s\nlaunch of the Community Benefits Plan, which\nis a five-year commitment to provide loans,\ninvestments, and other support to low- and\nmoderate-income communities, including\ncommunities of color. Additional information\nabout our corporate responsibility\ninitiatives, community engagement and\ncommitments are presented in this proxy\nstatement and through reports available on\nusbank.com. This important work reflects the\ncompany\u2019s commitment to uphold its core values\nand to continue to invest in the communities\nwe serve. On behalf of the Board, thank you\nfor your trust in \u2014 and support of \u2014 U.S.\nBancorp. I look forward to serving you during\n2024. Sincerely, Roland A.

All directors are elected annually to\nserve one-year terms until the next annual\nmeeting and until their successors are elected\nand qualified. All of our current directors\nhave been nominated for election by the Board\nto hold office until the 2025 annual meeting\nand the election of their successors. All of\nthe nominees currently serve on our Board.\nEach of these nominees has previously been\nelected by our shareholders. The Board has\ndetermined that, except for Andrew Cecere, our\nChairman, President and Chief Executive\nOfficer, each nominee for election as a\ndirector at the annual meeting is independent\nfrom U.S. Bancorp as discussed later in this\nproxy statement under \u201cCorporate governance \u2014\ndirector independence.\u201d Director selection and\nnomination considerations Director nominee\nselection process The selection process for\nfirst-time director candidates includes the\nfollowing steps: \u25b6 identification of one or\nmore desired profiles for director candidates\nbased on the most recent assessment of the\nskill sets represented on the Board compared\nto the Board\u2019s needs, as well as feedback\nreceived from the Board evaluation process; \u25b6\nidentification of candidates by the Governance\nCommittee based upon information provided by a\ndirector search firm, suggestions from current\ndirectors and executive officers, and any\nrecommendations received from shareholders and\nother sources; \u25b6 interviews of candidates by\nthe Lead Independent Director and other\ndirectors; \u25b6 reports presented to the Board by\nthe Governance Committee on the candidates and\nselection process; \u25b6 recommendations made by\nthe Governance Committee; and \u25b6 election by\nthe Board or formal nomination by the Board\nfor inclusion in the slate of directors at the\nannual meeting. A shareholder seeking to\nrecommend a prospective candidate for the\nGovernance Committee\u2019s consideration should\nsubmit the candidate\u2019s name and sufficient\nwritten information about the candidate to\npermit a determination by the Governance\nCommittee of whether the candidate meets the\ndirector selection criteria set forth in our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines.\nRecommendations should be sent to the Chair of\nthe Governance Committee in care of the\nCorporate Secretary of U.S. Bancorp at the\naddress listed on page 103 of this proxy\nstatement. Commitment to Board diversity Our\ncompany is committed to diversity, equity and\ninclusion. Our Board is focused on diversity\nwithin its membership in order to benefit from\na variety of perspectives, experiences and\nskill sets in exercising its oversight role.\nThe Board\u2019s commitment to diversity is\nreflected in our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines, which require that any director\nsearch firm used to identify external\ncandidates for a Board vacancy will be\nrequested to present a diverse slate of\ncandidates. Board refreshment and nomination\nconsiderations Our Governance Committee\ncontinuously assesses the evolving\nopportunities and challenges facing our\ncompany in order to align the Board\u2019s\ncomposition with our company\u2019s leadership\nneeds and strategic direction. The Governance\nCommittee evaluates the composition of the\nBoard against the company\u2019s needs every year,\nwhich culminates in the process of nominating\nnew and incumbent directors. The Governance\nCommittee\u2019s decision to renominate an\nincumbent director is informed by the\ndirector\u2019s past attendance at meetings,\nparticipation in the work of the Board and\noverall contribution to the Board, as assessed\nin the annual Board evaluation process. The\nBoard\u2019s commitment to refreshment can require\ncandid conversations with individual directors\nwhen the Governance Committee has determined\nthat a different Board composition would\nincrease the Board\u2019s effectiveness. As a\nresult of the Board evaluation and skills-to-\nstrategy alignment processes, directors may\ndecide or be asked not to stand for re-\nelection at the next annual meeting.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy              9    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 1 \u2014 Election of\ndirectors When a new director is sought, the\nGovernance Committee considers the following\nfactors: \u25b6 Skills and qualifications:When\nconsidering the skills and backgrounds\ndesirable in future Board members, the\nGovernance Committee identifies the\nprofessional experience and skill sets\nrepresented on the Board and compares them to\nthe skill sets that the Governance Committee\nbelieves is important to have represented\namong the directors at any given time in light\nof the company\u2019s current business, strategy,\nrisks and opportunities. Any gaps become focus\nareas for director search efforts. See below\nfor additional information on our directors\u2019\nskills and qualifications. \u25b6 Personal\nqualities:The Governance Committee will only\nconsider as candidates for director\nindividuals who possess the highest personal\nand professional ethics and integrity, and who\nare committed to representing the long-term\ninterests of all our stakeholders. Directors\nmust be able to work in a collegial manner\nwith persons of different educational,\nbusiness and cultural backgrounds. \u25b6\nDiversity:Our Governance Committee regularly\nreviews the composition of the Board in light\nof the backgrounds, industries, skills,\nprofessional experience, geographic\ncommunities, gender, race, ethnicity and other\npersonal qualities and attributes represented\nby our current members. The Governance\nCommittee incorporates this broad view of\ndiversity into its director nomination process\nand is committed to ensuring that the Board\u2019s\ncomposition as a whole appropriately reflects\nthe current and anticipated needs of the Board\nand our company. The Governance Committee\nseeks women and people of color as candidates\nin every search effort. \u25b6 Capacity:Serving on\nthe board of a large financial institution\nrequires a significant commitment of time and\nenergy, and directors must be willing and able\nto devote sufficient attention to carrying out\ntheir duties and responsibilities effectively.\nThe Governance Committee will consider the\nprofessional and other demands placed on\ncandidates, including service on the boards of\nother public or private companies. Unless the\nBoard determines that a director\u2019s service to\nour company would not be impaired, a director\nmay not serve on more than three other boards\nof public companies in addition to our Board,\nand a director who serves as the CEO of a\npublic company may not serve on more than two\npublic company boards (including our Board and\nthe board of the company of which he or she\nserves as CEO). \u25b6 Tenure and refreshment:Our\nGovernance Committee believes that it is\nimportant to maintain a balance of tenure on\nthe Board to benefit from the business,\nindustry and governance experience of longer-\nserving directors and the fresh perspectives\ncontributed by new directors, while\nrecognizing the value of continuity as Board\ncomposition changes. Our Governance Committee\naims to have a measured rate of Board\nrefreshment. \u25b6 Retirement and other\nconsiderations for incumbent directors:In\naddition to the factors stated above, the\nGovernance Committee will evaluate any\ndirector\u2019s continued service on the Board for\nappropriateness in each of the following\ncircumstances: the director has a change in\nemployment or other major responsibilities; an\nemployee director ceases to be a company\nemployee; and the director has reached the age\nof 72 since the last meeting of shareholders\nat which the director was elected.\n                                              \n    10      U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 1 \u2014 Election of\ndirectors\n\nSkills and qualifications of our director\nnominees The Governance Committee has\nidentified certain skills, experiences and\nprofessional qualifications that are important\nto be represented on the Board for strong\ncollective oversight of the company\u2019s business\nand strategy.

Baxter, Dorothy J.\nBridges, Elizabeth L. Buse, Alan B. Colberg,\nKimberly N. Ellison-Taylor, Kimberly J.\nHarris, Roland A. Hernandez, Richard P.\nMcKenney, Yusuf I. Mehdi, Loretta E. Reynolds,\nJohn P. Wiehoff and Scott W. Wine. Andrew\nCecere is not independent because he is an\nexecutive officer of U.S. Bancorp. The Board\nhad determined that Olivia F. Kirtley was an\nindependent director prior to her retirement\nfrom the Board in April 2023. Our Board has\nadopted a set of standards in our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines to assist it in\nassessing the independence of each of our non-\nemployee directors. A director of U.S. Bancorp\nwho meets the independence qualifications of\nthe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing\nstandards may be deemed \u201cindependent\u201d by the\nBoard of Directors after consideration of the\nrelationships between U.S. Bancorp or any of\nits affiliates and the director or any of his\nor her immediate family members or other\nrelated parties. Our Board deems the following\nrelationships to be categorically immaterial\nsuch that they will not, by themselves, affect\nan independence determination: \u25b6 a\nrelationship between our company and an\norganization of which the director or a member\nof his or her immediate family is an executive\nofficer if that role does not constitute that\nperson\u2019s principal occupation; \u25b6 an ordinary\nbanking relationship for services readily\navailable from other large financial\ninstitutions; \u25b6 employment by our company of a\nmember of the director\u2019s immediate family if\nthat person\u2019s annual compensation does not\nexceed $120,000; and \u25b6 a relationship between\nour company and an organization with which the\ndirector or a member of his or her immediate\nfamily is affiliated if (a) the relationship\narises in the ordinary course of both parties\u2019\noperations and (b) the aggregate annual amount\ninvolved does not exceed $120,000. The only\nrelationships between U.S. Bancorp and our\ndirectors or the directors\u2019 related interests\nthat were considered by the Board when\nassessing the independence of our non-employee\ndirectors are the relationships between U.S.\nBancorp and Microsoft Corporation, a\ncorporation with which our director Yusuf I.\nMehdi is affiliated. The Board determined that\nthese relationships, which are described later\nin this proxy statement under the heading\n\u201cRelated person transactions,\u201d do not impair\nMr. Mehdi\u2019s independence. This determination\nwas based on the Board\u2019s conclusion that the\namounts involved in transactions between U.S.\nBancorp and Microsoft are immaterial to\nMicrosoft\u2019s gross revenues and that the\nrelationships had no unique characteristics\nthat could influence Mr. Mehdi\u2019s impartial\njudgment as a director of U.S. Bancorp.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             23    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance\n\nBoard leadership structure Board leadership\npolicies and practices Our Board believes that\na strong, independent Board of Directors is\ncritical to effective oversight of management.\nThe Board carefully considers the important\nissue of the best independent leadership\nstructure for the Board and maintains a\nflexible policy regarding the issue of whether\nthe position of Chairman should be held by an\nindependent director. At least annually, the\nBoard reviews the Board\u2019s and company\u2019s needs\nand the leadership attributes of its directors\nand executives to determine whether our\ncompany is best served at that particular time\nby having the CEO or another director hold the\nposition of Chairman. In order to provide\nstrong independent Board leadership when the\nposition of Chairman is not held by an\nindependent director, the independent\ndirectors elect a Lead Independent Director\nwith the substantial leadership\nresponsibilities detailed below. The Lead\nIndependent Director is elected annually upon\nthe recommendation of the Governance\nCommittee, with the expectation that he or she\nwill generally serve three, and may serve up\nto five, consecutive terms. In addition, our\nLead Independent Director is empowered with,\nand exercises, robust and well-defined duties\nreflected in our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines that were most recently amended in\nOctober 2023 and are summarized below. In\naddition to strong independent leadership of\nthe full Board, each of the Audit Committee,\nGovernance Committee, and Compensation and\nHuman Resources Committee is composed solely\nof independent directors. Independent\ndirectors, therefore, oversee critical, risk-\nsensitive matters such as the quality and\nintegrity of our financial statements; the\ncompensation of our executive officers,\nincluding the CEO; the nomination of\ndirectors; and the evaluation of the Board,\nits committees and its members.

The standing committees report on\ntheir deliberations and actions at each full\nBoard meeting. Each of the standing committees\nhas the authority to engage outside experts,\nadvisers and counsel to the extent it\nconsiders appropriate to assist the committee\nin its work. Each of the standing committees\nhas adopted and operates under a written\ncharter. The Governance Committee and Board\nregularly review the Board\u2019s structure and the\noversight responsibilities of each Board\ncommittee in order to provide effective\noversight. In January 2024, the Board of\nDirectors determined it was in the best\ninterest of the company to recombine the\nCapital Planning Committee into the Risk\nManagement Committee to integrate Board\noversight across capital, liquidity and\ninterest rate risks. The Board amended the\nRisk Management Committee\u2019s charter to\nincorporate all of its prior oversight\nresponsibilities, including those relating to\ncapital planning and management and recovery\nand resolution planning. In addition, the\nBoard determined to increase the length and\nnumber of Risk Management Committee meetings\nper year in light of the expansion of its\nprimary oversight responsibilities. The Board\nalso elected the former chair of the Capital\nPlanning Committee as a member of the Risk\nManagement Committee, effective in January\n2024. The independent directors meet in\nexecutive session (without the CEO or any\nother member of management present) at the end\nof each regularly scheduled Board meeting and\nmay also meet in executive session at any\nother time. The Lead Independent Director\npresides over these executive sessions. During\neach committee meeting, the committees have\nthe opportunity to hold executive sessions\nwithout members of management present. The\nBoard of Directors held 13 meetings during\n2023. Each director attended at least 75% of\nthe total meetings of the Board and Board\ncommittees on which he or she served during\nthe year. The average attendance rate of all\ndirectors at Board and Board committee\nmeetings in 2023 was 98%. Directors are\nexpected to attend all meetings of\nshareholders.

The Audit\nCommittee charter generally prohibits Audit\nCommittee members from serving on more than\ntwo other public company audit committees.\nCurrently, no Audit Committee member exceeds\nthis limitation. At all times, one or more\nmembers of our Audit Committee possess the\neducation or experience required to qualify as\nan \u201caudit committee financial expert\u201d as\ndefined by the SEC, and one or more members of\nour Risk Management Committee have experience\nidentifying, assessing and managing the risk\nexposures of large, complex financial firms,\nin accordance with rules promulgated by the\nFederal Reserve Board. Compensation Committee\nInterlocks and Insider Participation Warner L.\nBaxter, Kimberly J. Harris, Roland A.\nHernandez, Olivia F. Kirtley and Scott W. Wine\nserved as members of the Compensation and\nHuman Resources Committee during 2023. During\n2023, no member of the Compensation and Human\nResources Committee was an employee, officer,\nor former officer of the company. None of our\nexecutive officers served in 2023 on the board\nof directors or compensation committee (or\nother committee serving an equivalent\nfunction) of any entity that had an executive\nofficer serving as a member of our Board or\nthe Compensation and Human Resources\nCommittee. As described under the \u201cRelated\nperson transactions\u201d section of this proxy\nstatement, in 2023, some Compensation and\nHuman Resources Committee members had\ntransactions in the ordinary course of\nbusiness with our banking and broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries. Majority vote standard for\nelection of directors Our bylaws provide that\nin uncontested elections, a nominee for\ndirector will be elected to the Board if the\nnumber of votes cast \u201cFOR\u201d the nominee\u2019s\nelection exceeds the number of votes cast\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d that nominee\u2019s election (votes to\n\u201cABSTAIN\u201d have no effect on the election of a\ndirector). The voting standard for directors\nin a contested election is a plurality of the\nvotes cast at the meeting. Our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines provide that director\nnominees must submit a contingent resignation\nin writing to the Governance Committee, which\nbecomes effective if the director fails to\nreceive a sufficient number of votes for re-\nelection at the annual meeting of shareholders\nand the Board accepts the resignation. The\nBoard will nominate for election or re-\nelection as director only candidates who have\ntendered such a contingent resignation. Our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines further\nprovide that if an incumbent director fails to\nreceive the required vote for re-election, our\nGovernance Committee will act within 90 days\nafter certification of the shareholder vote to\ndetermine whether to accept the director\u2019s\nresignation, and will submit a recommendation\nfor prompt consideration by the Board. The\nBoard expects the director whose resignation\nis under consideration to abstain from\nparticipating in any decision regarding his or\nher resignation. The Governance Committee and\nthe Board may consider any factors they deem\nrelevant in deciding whether to accept a\ndirector\u2019s resignation.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             29    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance Board\nperformance evaluations Our Board continually\nseeks to improve its performance. Our\nGovernance Committee conducts an annual\nassessment of the Board\u2019s performance to\ndetermine whether the Board, its committees\nand its members are functioning effectively\nand to identify areas for growth and\nimprovement. We believe that our formal annual\nevaluation process contributes to the overall\nfunctioning and ongoing effectiveness of our\nBoard. The annual process is as follows:\n                                              \n    30      U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance Based\non director feedback received over the last\nseveral years through this annual evaluation\nprocess and other channels, including feedback\nprovided by directors at meetings, management\nhas continued to leverage executive summaries\nand highlights pages for committee meeting\nmaterials, bring timely focus topics for\ndiscussion at appropriate Board and committee\nmeetings, and augment the director education\nand onboarding processes. In addition, the\nGovernance Committee has received information\nabout the skills and qualifications that\ndirectors would like future Board or committee\nmembers to have, information the Board would\nlike to discuss as part of its annual strategy\nsession and ongoing updates on the company\u2019s\nbusiness and strategy, the continued\nimportance of diverse perspectives on the\nBoard, the content of committee chair reports\nto the full Board, and topics for discussion\nat future Board meetings and Board education\nsessions. Director feedback has also led to\ndiscussion of how to appropriately balance\noversight responsibility for critical matters\naffecting our company among the Board and its\ncommittees, as reflected in the Board\u2019s\ndecision to integrate oversight of capital,\nliquidity and interest rate risks by\nrecombining the Capital Planning Committee\ninto the Risk Management Committee in January\n2024. Director orientation and onboarding We\nconduct a comprehensive director onboarding\nprogram that is individually tailored to take\ninto account a director\u2019s prior experience and\nbackground. New directors receive an\norientation to the company and the Board that\nincludes comprehensive background briefings by\nthe Chief Executive Officer, other members of\nsenior management, and the Corporate\nSecretary. New director orientation covers a\nreview of the company\u2019s business lines,\nenterprise functions, risk management and\ncompliance, strategy, financial statement and\nrelated matters, regulatory matters, corporate\ngovernance and key policies and practices\n(including the Company\u2019s Code of Ethics and\nBusiness Conduct), as well as the role and\nresponsibilities of a director. New director\nonboarding and orientation may occur over the\ncourse of several months and continues to be\nenhanced based on best practices and director\nfeedback. The onboarding program is regularly\nupdated based on director feedback to\nfacilitate integration of new directors on the\nBoard. Director education Continuing director\neducation is an important element of\nmaintaining a strong Board of Directors. It is\nimportant for our directors to continually\nreceive additional information and training\nthat will help them to effectively oversee the\nmanagement of our company. We have implemented\na robust director education program that\nbegins with in-depth training covering our\nindustry and each of our lines of business,\nand that continues with special education\nsessions throughout the year that highlight\ncurrent business, industry, regulatory and\ngovernance topics presented by internal and\nexternal experts. Separate Board education\nsessions held in 2023 focused on business,\nstrategy, asset and liability management,\ndiversity, equity and inclusion, operations\ntransformation and cybersecurity topics. These\neducation sessions are in addition to any\neducation components of regular updates on key\nand emerging topics provided to the Board and\neach of its committees throughout the year.\nDirectors are also encouraged to attend\ncontinuing training sessions offered by\noutside providers on topics related to general\ncorporate governance as well as specialized\nareas in risk management, audit, compensation\nand other matters, at the company\u2019s expense.\nManagement makes information available to all\ndirectors on a quarterly basis about upcoming\nexternal director education programs. Ethics\nand conduct We are deeply committed to\nmaintaining the highest standards of ethical\nconduct that reflect our purpose and core\nvalues, and which allow us to build trust with\nour customers and the communities we serve. In\nrecognition of that commitment, for the ninth\nconsecutive year, we were named one of the\nWorld\u2019s Most Ethical Companies\u00ae in 2023 by the\nEthisphere Institute. Our Code of Ethics and\nBusiness Conduct, which is available on our\nwebsite at usbank.com by clicking on \u201cAbout\nus\u201d, \u201cInvestor relations\u201d, \u201cCorporate\nGovernance\u201d and then \u201cGovernance documents\u201d,\noutlines the responsibilities of every\nemployee and director to our customers and\nbusiness partners, our shareholders, our\ncommunity and each other. Succession planning\nand management development A primary\nresponsibility of the Board is planning for\nCEO succession, as well as overseeing\nsuccession planning for other senior\nmanagement positions, to ensure that we have\nthe right management talent to pursue our\nstrategic goals. The Board\u2019s process targets\nthe building of enhanced management depth and\nskills, considers continuity and stability\nwithin our company, and responds to our\ncompany\u2019s evolving needs and changing\ncircumstances. To achieve these goals, the\nexecutive talent development and succession\nplanning process is integrated into the\nBoard\u2019s annual activities.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             31    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance\n\nThe Governance Committee has established a CEO\nsuccession planning process that considers the\nprofile and skills most critical to leadership\nof the company, includes ongoing evaluation of\na number of potential internal and external\nsuccessor candidates, and addresses emergency,\ntemporary scenarios as well as long-term\nsuccession.

Within our\nlearning ecosystem, we offer all employees\ndevelopment resources and programs on a range\nof technical and professional topics. We also\nintroduced the One U.S. Bank leadership\nprofile, a common framework to grow talent for\nthe future. The framework will be used to\nconsistently hire, coach and develop talent,\nevaluate performance, and succession plan. We\nalso offer various mentorship, leadership, and\ndevelopment opportunities that allow\nparticipants, including women and people of\ncolor, to network, enhance executive presence,\nand build peer support. Our hiring program\nstrives to include the inclusion of at least\none woman or one person of color on interview\nslates for all roles to further advance our\ntalent and diversity, equity and inclusion\nstrategy. \u25b6 Inclusive Culture We are committed\nto creating an inclusive culture where all\nemployees are valued. Our Business Resource\nGroups (BRGs) are available to all employees\nand are foundational to our culture.

We\nalso value our employees\u2019 opinions and use\ntheir feedback in a variety of ways at all\nlevels of the organization to improve our\ncompany, customer and employee experiences.\nOne of our cornerstone programs is Your Voice\nMatters: Talk to Us through which all\nemployees are given an opportunity to provide\nfeedback on an ongoing basis on a variety of\ntopics, which allows us to be responsive to\nfeedback and measure employee sentiment and\nengagement. \u25b6 Compensation and Benefits\nMaintaining competitive compensation and\nbenefits practices is a continued focus for\nus. In addition to a 401(k) matching program,\nwe maintain an active cash balance pension\nprogram for which newly hired employees are\neligible. We also continue to support work\nprograms with remote and in-person work\narrangements, as suitable for employees\u2019\nroles. To ensure employees are compensated\nfairly, we have processes in place to address\ngender and racial pay inequities and conduct\nperiodic reviews of employee pay levels across\ngender and racial categories with the help of\nan independent third-party consultant. In our\n2023 review, on average, employees of the\ncompany in the U.S. who are women were paid\ngreater than 99% of what their male\ncounterparts were paid, and employees of the\ncompany in the U.S. who are people of color\nwere paid greater than 99% of what their white\ncounterparts were paid, in each case taking\ninto account several factors including\ncomparable jobs, experience, and location. The\n2023 review excluded former Union Bank\nemployees who had not yet fully transitioned\nas a result of ongoing acquisition integration\nefforts. We also continue to further pay\ntransparency through our recruitment and\ntalent processes where every open position\nposting in the U.S. has a disclosed base pay\nrange.\n                                              \n    34      U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance\nRecognition We are proud to be recognized for\nour commitment to ethical business conduct.

The committees must\ntherefore be confident that an appropriate\nrisk monitoring structure is in place at the\nmanagement level in order to be provided\naccurate and useful informational reports. The\nmanagement-level risk oversight structure is\nrobust. Our company relies on comprehensive\nrisk management processes to identify,\naggregate and measure, manage, and monitor\nrisks. This system enables the Board of\nDirectors to establish a mutual understanding\nwith management of the effectiveness of our\ncompany\u2019s risk management practices and\ncapabilities, to review our company\u2019s risk\nexposure and to elevate certain key risks for\ndiscussion at the Board level. A framework\nexists to account for the introduction of\nemerging risks or any increase in risks\nroutinely taken, which would either be largely\ncontrolled by the risk limits in place or\nidentified through the frequent risk reporting\nthat occurs throughout our company.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             37    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance The\nExecutive Risk Committee, which is chaired by\nour Chief Risk Officer and includes the CEO\nand other members of the executive management\nteam, oversees execution against the Risk\nManagement Framework and company-level Risk\nAppetite Statement. The Executive Risk\nCommittee meets monthly, and more frequently\nwhen circumstances merit, to provide executive\nmanagement oversight of our Risk Management\nFramework, assess appropriate levels of risk\nexposure and actions that may be required for\nidentified risks to be adequately mitigated,\npromote effective management of all risk\ncategories, and foster the establishment and\nmaintenance of an effective risk culture. The\nExecutive Risk Committee members manage large,\nsophisticated groups within our company that\nare dedicated to controlling and monitoring\nrisk to the levels deemed appropriate by the\nBoard of Directors and executive management.\nThese individuals, together with our company\u2019s\nController, Treasurer and others, also provide\nthe Board\u2019s committees with information the\ncommittees need and request in order to carry\nout their oversight responsibilities. The\nExecutive Risk Committee focuses on current\nand emerging risks, including strategic,\nreputational and conduct risks, directing\ntimely and comprehensive actions. Senior\noperating committees have also been\nestablished as part of the risk governance\nstructure under our Risk Management Framework\nto support the work of the Executive Risk\nCommittee, with each having responsibility for\noversight of a specified category of risk. Our\nBoard and management-level committees are\nsupported by a \u201cthree lines of defense\u201d model\nfor establishing effective checks and\nbalances. The first line of defense, primarily\nthe revenue-generating business lines, manages\nrisks in conformity with established limits\nand policy requirements. In turn, business\nleaders and their risk officers establish\nprograms to ensure conformity with these\nlimits and policy requirements. The second\nline of defense, primarily the Chief Risk\nOfficer\u2019s organization, but also including the\npolicy and oversight activities of corporate\nsupport functions, translates risk appetite\nand strategy into actionable risk limits and\npolicies. The second line of defense monitors\nthe first line of defense\u2019s compliance with\nlimits and policies, and provides reporting\nand escalation of emerging risks and other\nconcerns to senior management and the Risk\nManagement Committee of the Board of\nDirectors. The third line of defense, internal\naudit, is responsible for providing the Audit\nCommittee and senior management with\nindependent assessment and assurance regarding\nthe effectiveness of our company\u2019s governance,\nrisk management and control processes.\n                                              \n    38      U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Certain relationships and\nrelated transactions Certain relationships and\nrelated transactions Review of related person\ntransactions The Board has adopted a written\nRelated Person Transactions Policy for the\nreview, evaluation and approval or\nratification of transactions between our\ncompany and its related persons. \u201cRelated\npersons\u201d under this policy include our\ndirectors, director nominees, executive\nofficers, holders of more than 5% of our\ncommon stock, and their respective immediate\nfamily members. \u201cImmediate family members\u201d\ninclude children, stepchildren, parents,\nstepparents, spouses, siblings, mothers- and\nfathers-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law,\nbrothers- and sisters-in-law, and any person\n(other than a tenant or employee) sharing the\nperson\u2019s household. Except as described below,\nthe policy requires the Governance Committee\nof the Board to review and evaluate and either\napprove or disapprove all transactions or\nseries of transactions in which: \u25b6 the amount\ninvolved will, or may be expected to, exceed\n$120,000 in any fiscal year; \u25b6 our company is\nor will be a participant; and \u25b6 a related\nperson has a direct or indirect interest. The\nBoard has determined that the Governance\nCommittee does not need to review or approve\ncertain transactions even if the amount\ninvolved will exceed $120,000, including the\nfollowing transactions: \u25b6 lending and other\nfinancial services transactions or\nrelationships that are in the ordinary course\nof business and non-preferential, and comply\nwith applicable laws; \u25b6 transactions in which\nthe related person\u2019s interest derives solely\nfrom his or her services as a director of,\nand/or his or her ownership of less than ten\npercent of the equity interest (other than a\ngeneral partner interest) in, another\ncorporation or organization that is a party to\nthe transaction; \u25b6 transactions in which the\nrelated person\u2019s interest derives solely from\nhis or her ownership of a class of equity\nsecurities of our company and all holders of\nthat class of equity securities received the\nsame benefit on a pro rata basis; \u25b6\ntransactions where the rates or charges\ninvolved are determined by competitive bids,\nor that involve the rendering of services as a\ncommon or contract carrier, or public utility,\nat rates or charges fixed in conformity with\nlaw or governmental authority; and \u25b6\nemployment and compensation arrangements for\nany executive officer and compensation\narrangements for any director, provided that\nsuch arrangements have been approved by the\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee.\nWhen considering whether to approve or ratify\na transaction, the Governance Committee will\nconsider facts and circumstances that it deems\nrelevant to its determination, including: \u25b6\nthe nature and extent of the related person\u2019s\ninterest in the transaction; \u25b6 whether the\ntransaction is on substantially the same terms\nas those prevailing at the time for comparable\ntransactions with persons not affiliated with\nour company; \u25b6 the materiality of the\ntransaction to each party; \u25b6 whether our\ncompany\u2019s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct\ncould be implicated, including whether the\ntransaction would create a conflict of\ninterest or appearance of a conflict of\ninterest; \u25b6 whether the transaction is in the\nbest interest of our company; and \u25b6 in the\ncase of a non-employee director, whether the\ntransaction would impair his or her\nindependence. No director is allowed to\nparticipate in the deliberations or vote on\nthe approval or ratification of a transaction\nif that director is a related person with\nrespect to the transaction under review. On an\nannual basis, the Governance Committee\nassesses all ongoing relationships with\nrelated persons to confirm that the\ntransactions are still appropriate.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             39    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Certain relationships and\nrelated transactions Related person\ntransactions Lending and other financial\nservices transactions During 2023, U.S.\nBancorp and our banking and broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries engaged in transactions in the\nordinary course of business with some of our\ndirectors, executive officers and the persons\nthat we know beneficially owned more than 5%\nof our common stock on December 31, 2023\n(BlackRock, Inc. and The Vanguard Group), and\nthe entities with which they are associated.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we\npurchased investment management technology\nproducts and advisory services from BlackRock\nand its affiliates. We and our customers also\nmay invest in mutual funds, exchange-traded\nfunds, and other products affiliated with\nBlackRock and Vanguard, and we and such firms\nmay receive fees in connection with those\ninvestments. All loans and loan commitments\nand any transactions involving other financial\nproducts and services in connection with these\ntransactions were made in the ordinary course\nof business, on substantially the same terms,\nincluding current interest rates and\ncollateral, as those prevailing at the time\nfor comparable transactions with others not\nrelated to our banking and broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries and did not involve more than the\nnormal risk of collectability or present other\nunfavorable features. Transactions with\nentities or individuals affiliated with\ndirectors or executive officers Our director\nYusuf I. Mehdi currently serves as Executive\nVice President, Consumer Chief Marketing\nOfficer, at Microsoft Corporation. The company\nobtains services in the ordinary course of\nbusiness from Microsoft, including desktop\nsoftware, server and cloud enrollment, and\nsupport and development of products. During\n2023, the company paid approximately $69\nmillion to Microsoft for those services. We\nalso entered into a relationship with\nMicrosoft in 2021 to purchase certain cloud\ncomputing services. The relationship consists\nof a cloud services contract with a 6-year\nterm and a variable payment amount based on\nour cloud service usage, and a 3-year\nimplementation and migration contract with\nfixed costs that are tied to achievement of\nmilestones and paid over the course of the\ncontract. The aggregate total payments over\nthe term of the cloud services relationship\nare expected to be between $200 million and\n$300 million. Any amounts paid for the cloud\ncomputing services in 2023 have been deducted\nfrom existing credits with Microsoft. As a\nresult, no actual payments were made under the\ncontract in 2023. The amounts paid for all of\nthese Microsoft products and services, in the\naggregate, are less than 2% of each company\u2019s\ntotal revenue. The annual revenue of Microsoft\nin fiscal year 2023 was approximately $212\nbillion. Since December 30, 2022, U.S. Bank\nhas employed Anne St.Clair, the sister of one\nof our retired executive officers who served\nas an executive officer until June 30, 2023\n(James B. Kelligrew), in a Wealth Management\nadvisor role which is a non-executive and non-\nstrategic position. She received compensation\nof approximately $520,000 for 2023, which\nincluded a one-time cash award of $140,000 to\ncompensate her for amounts forfeited from her\nprior employer. In March 2023, we also granted\nher a long-term cash award of $12,500 and 270\nRSUs which will convert to shares of common\nstock upon vesting and which had a grant date\nfair value of approximately $12,500 (based on\nthe NYSE closing price per share of our common\nstock of $46.31 on the grant date). The annual\nbusiness line incentive plan she participated\nin for 2023 is primarily commission-based. In\naddition, she receives employee benefits\ngenerally available to our employees. The\ncompany established her compensation\nconsistent with our compensation practices\napplicable to employees in similar positions\nwith equivalent qualifications and\nresponsibilities. These transactions were\nconducted at arm\u2019s length and in the ordinary\ncourse of business by each party to the\ntransactions. As discussed above under the\nheading \u201cDirector independence,\u201d the Board of\nDirectors has determined that the amounts\ninvolved in the transactions between U.S.\nBancorp and Microsoft are immaterial to\nMicrosoft\u2019s gross revenues, and that the\nrelationships had no unique characteristics\nthat could influence Mr. Mehdi\u2019s impartial\njudgment, and that Mr. Mehdi is an independent\ndirector.\n                                              \n    40      U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 2 \u2014 Advisory vote\non executive compensation\n\nProposal 2 \u2014 Advisory vote on executive\ncompensation Executive compensation is an\nimportant matter to us.

This proposal, commonly known as a\n\u201cSay-on-Pay\u201d proposal, gives our shareholders\nthe opportunity to express their views on the\ncompensation of our named executive officers\n(NEOs) in accordance with Section 14A of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the Exchange Act). We have been conducting\nannual advisory votes to approve executive\ncompensation since 2009 and expect to conduct\nthe next advisory vote at our 2025 annual\nmeeting of shareholders. We have designed our\nexecutive compensation program to create long-\nterm shareholder value by attracting and\nretaining talented leaders and rewarding them\nfor top performance.

This vote is not intended to address\nany specific item of compensation, but rather\nour overall compensation policies and\nprocedures relating to our NEOs described in\nthis proxy statement. Accordingly, your vote\nwill not directly affect or otherwise limit\nany existing compensation or award arrangement\nof any of our NEOs. Because your vote is\nadvisory, it will not be binding upon the\nBoard of Directors. However, the Board values\nour shareholders\u2019 opinions, and the\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee\nwill take into account the outcome of the vote\nwhen considering future executive compensation\narrangements.\n                                              \n        \u200b                             FOR      \n        The Board of Directors                \n        recommends that you vote              \n        \u201cFOR\u201d approval of the                 \n        compensation of our named             \n        executive officers, as                \n        disclosed in this proxy               \n        statement.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             41    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nCompensation discussion and analysis This\nsection explains how we compensated the\nindividuals who served as our CEO or CFO\nduring 2023 and each of our other most highly\ncompensated executive officers for 2023 as\ndetermined under SEC rules (our named\nexecutive officers, or NEOs).

overview\nProgram structure in 2023 Our Compensation and\nHuman Resources Committee (referred to herein\nas the Committee) considers the views of our\nshareholders, along with industry trends and\nthe specific strategy of our company, when\ndesigning our executive compensation program.\nThe Committee considers the high level of\nsupport for our recent Say on Pay votes \u2014 over\n92% in each of the last six years \u2014 as a\ncontinuing endorsement from our shareholders\nthat our executive compensation program is\nstructured effectively. In light of this\nsustained level of shareholder support, the\nCommittee did not make any structural changes\nto our executive compensation program as a\nresult of the 2023 Say on Pay vote. 2023\nperformance-based compensation results Our\n2023 compensation outcomes reflect our pay for\nperformance philosophy, demonstrated through\nincentives that are earned based on\nachievement levels relative to goals that the\nCommittee believes focus on long-term\nshareholder value creation. \u25b6 Payouts for\nNEOs\u2019 2023 annual cash incentive awards ranged\nfrom 78.1% to 86.2% of their respective target\namounts, based on earnings per share (EPS) and\nbusiness line pretax income results for the\nyear. \u25b6 The PRSUs granted in 2021 were earned\nat 128.1% of the NEOs\u2019 respective target\namounts, based on absolute and relative return\non equity (ROE) results for the 2021-2023\nperformance period. Our ROE performance was\nconsistently in the top-quartile relative to\nthe peer group during that period. Corporate\nfinancial performance In 2023, our company\ncontinued to demonstrate its financial\nstrength and stability as well as the benefits\nof our diversified business model, as we\nmaintained our sound credit quality and strong\ncapital and liquidity position during a\nchallenging banking and risk landscape. The\ncompany focused on prudent balance sheet\npositioning, disciplined credit management,\nand continued capital accretion, while\ncontinuing to support customers throughout the\n2023 bank market disruption. Credit quality\nremains strong as we prudently manage credit\nunderwriting with a through-the-cycle view and\ncontinue to maintain healthy capital and\nliquidity levels given the uncertain economic\nenvironment. We also continued to invest in\nkey business initiatives to drive future\ngrowth. In May 2023, we successfully completed\nthe main systems conversion of MUFG Union\nBank, and continue to benefit from post-\nconversion synergies to leverage our broad\nproduct set, distribution network, and\ndigitization and payments ecosystem.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             43    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nElements of total direct compensation 1.\nExcludes John C.

The Committee achieves\nthis objective through a compensation program\nthat: \u25b6 links a significant portion of total\ncompensation to corporate and business line\nperformance metrics, which we believe serves\nto create long-term shareholder value; \u25b6\nprovides total compensation that is market\ncompetitive, permitting us to hire and retain\nhigh caliber individuals; \u25b6 emphasizes long-\nterm, stock-based compensation, encouraging\nour executive officers to think and act as\nlong-term shareholders; \u25b6 subjects equity\nawards to multi-year performance, vesting and\nretention requirements that enhance executive\nownership and encourage a long-term view of\ncorporate achievement; and \u25b6 encourages an\nappropriate sensitivity to risk on the part of\nsenior management, which protects long-term\nshareholder interests. Pay for performance We\noperate in a highly complex business\nenvironment and compete with both well-\nestablished financial institutions and also\nwith non-banks. Our long-term business\nobjective is to maximize shareholder value by\nconsistently delivering superior returns on\ncommon equity that exceed the cost of equity.\nIf we are successful in achieving this\nobjective, the Committee believes the results\nwill benefit our shareholders. Accordingly,\nour executive compensation program is designed\nto reward our executives for achieving annual\nand long-term financial results that further\nour long-term business objectives. \u25b6 The\nannual cash incentive plan rewards performance\nrelative to corporate EPS and business line\npretax income targets established at the\nbeginning of the fiscal year, with\nconsideration of qualitative factors to\nsupport alignment with additional corporate\npriorities. \u25b6 NEOs earn PRSUs based on\nachievement of ROE targets over a three-year\nperiod, which directly measure the return\ngenerated by the company on shareholders\u2019\ninvestment. \u25b6 The ultimate value of both the\nPRSUs and RSUs earned depends on our long-term\nfinancial success, as reflected in the price\nof our common stock. At the same time, the\nCommittee carefully weighs the risks inherent\nin our executive compensation program against\nthe program\u2019s goals and the company\u2019s risk\nappetite. Additional discussion of the risk\noversight undertaken by the Committee can be\nfound below under \u201cDecision making and\npolicies \u2014 risk considerations.\u201d Pay levels\nWhen determining executive compensation levels\neach year, the Committee considers the value\nof each compensation element as well as the\nvalue of the total direct compensation\npackage. Key factors that inform pay levels\ninclude the following: \u25b6 a review of market\ndata and the competitive landscape, which\nincludes our complexity and size relative to\nour peer institutions and the comparability of\nour NEOs\u2019 responsibilities to corresponding\nroles at peer institutions; \u25b6 the performance,\nexperience and expertise of the executive,\nincluding expanded scope of responsibilities\nwhen applicable; \u25b6 internal pay equity within\nthe executive officer group; \u25b6 the company\u2019s\nstrategy and performance; \u25b6 the company\u2019s and\neach individual executive\u2019s risk management; \u25b6\nbusiness line performance as applicable for\nNEOs; \u25b6 compensation actions applicable to the\nbroader employee base; and \u25b6 key talent\nsuccession planning and retention\nconsiderations.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             45    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nCompensation elements Our NEOs\u2019 total direct\ncompensation consists of three elements: \u25b6\nBase salary; \u25b6 Annual cash incentive awards;\nand \u25b6 Long-term incentive compensation\n(comprising 60% PRSUs and 40% RSUs). Base\nsalary Base salary is the only component of\nthe NEOs\u2019 total direct compensation that is\nnot at risk. The Committee considers the\nsalary of executive officers relative to\ncomparable executives in our compensation peer\ngroup and may make market-based adjustments as\nit deems appropriate. Salaries can also be\nadjusted to reflect experience and tenure in a\nposition, internal pay equity within the\nexecutive officer group, promotions or\nincreased scope of responsibilities,\nindividual performance, and retention\nconsiderations. 2023 salary actions: The\nCommittee adjusted each of the NEOs\u2019 base\nsalaries in 2023 between 2.9% and 4.0%,\nprimarily to reflect competitive market\nconditions.

Prior to his appointment as\nChief Financial Officer on September 1, 2023,\nMr. Stern was eligible to receive an award\nunder the company\u2019s Annual Incentive Plan\n(AIP) for 2023 performance. His target award\nlevel under the AIP was $450,000 for 2023. The\nperformance goals, award structure, and other\nterms applicable to awards under the AIP are\nthe same as those applicable for 2023 AEIP\nawards, except that the EPS results were\nweighted 35% and the business line pretax\nincome results were weighted 65% in the\ncalculation of his pro-rated award under the\nAIP for 2023. Calculating the Final Bonus\nFunding Percentage The Bonus Funding\nPercentageis calculated using two evenly\nweighted factors: \u25b6 the Corporate Result,\nwhich is based on EPS performance for 2023, as\nadjusted; and \u25b6 the Business Line Result,\nwhich is based on applicable business line or\ncorporate pretax income performance for the\nexecutive officer. The Committee believes that\nEPS and pretax income targets are appropriate\nperformance metrics for the executive\nofficers\u2019 annual cash incentive awards for the\nfollowing reasons: \u25b6 EPS is a common metric\nused by investors to evaluate the\nprofitability of a company, showing the\nearnings (net income) we make on each\noutstanding share of common stock; \u25b6 a focus\non EPS supports alignment of the interests of\nthe executive officers with those of\nshareholders; \u25b6 EPS captures elements of\ncorporate performance that are beyond those of\nthe individual operating business lines, such\nas corporate funding policies and the\nmanagement and use of capital; \u25b6 the pretax\nincome targets are the fundamental drivers of\nthe company\u2019s revenues and income before\ntaxes; and \u25b6 the EPS and pretax income targets\nare aligned with annual financial plan\ntargets, which the Board and management have\nassessed for achievability; accordingly, the\ntargets provide incentives to take appropriate\namounts of risk to achieve those goals.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             47    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis In addition, both EPS and pretax\nincome are used across the organization for\ncash bonus payout calculations, and the\nCommittee believes that using these measures\nin executive officer incentive award\ncalculations supports alignment with their\nareas of responsibility. Both the Corporate\nResult and Business Line Result are assessed\nrelative to targets included in our company\u2019s\nannual financial plan. The Board establishes\nthese financial targets at the beginning of\nthe fiscal year with the intent that they\nrepresent challenging, yet achievable, goals.\nUnder the AEIP, the Committee has the\nauthority to adjust results to exclude the\neffect of certain events. The Final Bonus\nFunding Percentage is calculated as follows: \u25b6\nCorporate Result:The percentage by which\ncorporate EPS differs from the EPS target is\nmultiplied by a leverage factor to magnify the\npositive or negative variation from the\nresults, yielding the Corporate Result. A\nleverage factor of 2:1 is applied to corporate\nachievement of EPS goals between 80% and 120%\nof target. For any amount by which corporate\nachievement of EPS goals is less than 80% or\nmore than 120%, the leverage factor is 1:1. \u2713\nThe target level of EPS set by the Committee\nfor 2023 was $5.43. This target EPS level is\nintended to reflect the core earnings of the\ncompany and, as such, excluded the impact of\nnotable items related to the MUFG Union Bank\nacquisition. Additional information on the\ncalculation of the 2023 Corporate Result,\nbased on adjusted EPS results, is described\nbelow. \u25b6 Business Line Result:A payout\ncomponent is calculated for each business line\nbased on the percentage by which the business\nline\u2019s pretax income varies from target, using\nthe same leverage factor as is applied to\ncorporate performance. For executives with\nleadership responsibilities for the entire\ncompany, including Messrs. Cecere, Dolan, and\nStern, or for those with a corporate-wide\nsupport function, including Mr. von Gillern,\nthe Business Line Result is based on the\nweighted average of the pretax income results\nof all the company\u2019s business lines. For\nexecutives who lead a revenue-producing group,\nincluding Ms. Kedia, Mr. Kotwal and Mr. Welsh,\nthe Business Line Result is based on the\nweighted average pretax income results of the\nbusiness lines within the group that the\nexecutive leads. Additional information on the\ncalculation of the 2023 Business Line Result,\nbased on adjusted pretax income results, for\neach NEO is described below. \u25b6 Each of the\nCorporate Result and the Business Line Result\nis multiplied by 50% and then added together\nto arrive at the Formulaic Bonus Funding\nPercentagefor each NEO. As discussed above,\nMr. Stern received pro-rated awards under the\nAIP and AEIP for 2023. For the pro-rated\nportion of his award under the AIP for service\nin roles during 2023 prior to his appointment\nas Chief Financial Officer, the Corporate\nResult was weighted 35% and the Business Line\nResult was weighted 65% in the calculation of\nhis award under that plan. \u25b6 The Committee\nperforms a Qualitative Reviewof the Formulaic\nBonus Funding Percentage, which includes a\nholistic assessment of performance on key\nstrategic priorities, as described below. The\nresults of the Committee\u2019s assessment of these\nadditional performance factors allows the\nCommittee to adjust the formulaic bonus\ncalculation by up to 25% (either positively or\nnegatively) to create greater alignment with\noverall organizational performance if\nappropriate.\n                                              \n    48      U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis 2023 Corporate Result: The Corporate\nResult was 67% and was calculated as follows:\n\u25b6 The target level of EPS set by the Committee\nfor 2023 excluding certain notable items was\n$5.43. \u25b6 The company reported EPS results of\n$3.27, which was adjusted upward by $1.26 for\npurposes of the Corporate Result to account\nfor notable items, including merger and\nintegration charges related to the MUFG Union\nBank acquisition, merger-related balance sheet\noptimization and capital actions taken to meet\nregulatory Category II capital commitments\nmade as a condition of the merger, certain\nnotable items that the Committee deemed\nappropriate and loan loss reserve variation as\ndescribed below. \u25b6 The resulting adjusted EPS\nvalue used to calculate the Corporate Result\nwas $4.53. \u25b6 The Corporate Result of 67% was\nthe outcome after applying the leverage factor\nto the percentage difference between target\nand adjusted EPS results. Funding and Payout\nof Corporate Result For purposes of computing\nthe Formulaic Bonus Funding Percentage for the\nCorporate Result, the Committee adjusts actual\nreported EPS to (i) remove the impact of any\nvariation in our loan loss reserve build or\nrelease on an after-tax basis, while including\nnet charge-offs to capture actual credit\nlosses experienced and (ii) normalize any\nnotable items that impacted EPS during the\nperformance year. The Committee established\nits approach to adjusting for variation in our\nloan loss reserve in 2020 in connection with\nour adoption of the Current Expected Credit\nLosses (CECL) accounting standard in January\n2020. Our adoption of CECL creates the\npotential for significant accounting\nvolatility and uncertainty with respect to the\nloan loss reserve that is often dependent upon\na number of judgmental factors and economic\nassumptions. In an effort to measure\nperformance based on actual credit losses, the\ncompany excludes changes in the allowance\ndriven by these factors and includes net\ncharge-offs in the determination. For 2023,\nthis calculation resulted in an upward\nadjustment to our reported EPS of $0.14. It\nhas also been the Committee\u2019s practice to\nadjust for notable items that are unusual or\nrelated to acquisitions. In 2023, the EPS\nresult was adjusted upward by $0.73 to exclude\nthe impact of merger and integration charges\nrelated to the MUFG Union Bank acquisition as\nwell as certain balance sheet repositioning\nand capital management actions, and a\nfoundation\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             49    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\ncontribution to fund a community benefit plan\nentered into as part of the merger. The\nCommittee also made an upward adjustment of\n$0.36 related to an FDIC special assessment,\nan upward adjustment of $0.08 per diluted\nshare to address a portion of deposit pricing\npressures caused by certain bank failures and\nmarket events during 2023 to ensure the\nretention of newly acquired MUFG Union Bank\ncustomer deposits and reduced the EPS result\nby $0.05 related to a favorable tax\nsettlement. The Committee adjustments resulted\nin a total Corporate Result EPS of $4.53. 2023\nBusiness Line Results: The Business Line\nResult was 93.5%, which was calculated as\nfollows: \u25b6 Pre-tax income targets are\nestablished at the beginning of the year for\neach of our company\u2019s 18 revenue-producing\nbusiness lines in support of our Corporate EPS\ntarget. \u25b6 For 2023, pretax income results,\ninclusive of the regular adjustments relating\nto loan loss reserves and CECL described above\nand adjustments for notable items related to\nthe MUFG Union Bank transaction, ranged from\n86.7% to 118.8% of target performance across\nour company\u2019s 18 revenue-producing business\nlines. \u25b6 These results generated Business Line\nResults of 73.5% to 137.6% following\napplication of the leverage factor and the 0%\nfloor and 200% ceiling. \u25b6 The weighted average\nBusiness Line Result of all business lines was\n93.5%. For purposes of computing the Formulaic\nBonus Funding Percentage for the Business Line\nResult, pretax income includes a component for\nchanges in the loan loss reserve driven by\nloan balances and changes in loan portfolio\ncredit quality. The Committee adjusts these\nresults so that the effect of any variation in\nour loan loss reserve build or release driven\nby such changes in loan portfolio credit\nquality is reduced by 50%. The Committee\nbelieves that this adjustment serves to align\nbonus funding with changes in credit quality\nwhile reducing some of the volatility caused\nby variable judgmental factors. The Committee\napplies these adjustments for loan loss\nreserve variation consistently, whether the\nultimate impact is positive or negative, and\nbelieves that such adjustments maintain\naccountability for credit quality.

For 2023, the\nqualitative review focused on the Committee\u2019s\nassessment of performance relative to key\nstrategic initiatives, including the MUFG\nUnion Bank conversion and integration,\nexecution of the company\u2019s capital strategy,\nthe completion of targeted expense\noptimization efforts, risk management,\npromoting client relationships with capital\nefficient solutions that prioritized deposit\ngathering and leveraged full-bank\ncapabilities, and company-wide transformation\ninitiatives, ESG, community and diversity,\nequity and inclusion initiatives, which\nincluded our environmental commitments and our\ncommitments under U.S. Bank Access Commitment\u2122\nand our Community Benefits Plan. 2023\nQualitative Review actions: Based on its\nassessment of corporate performance and the\nfactors noted above, the Committee determined\nthat the formulaic outcomes appropriately\nrecognized performance for the company\u2019s\nexecutive officers in 2023 and, therefore, did\nnot to make any qualitative adjustments to the\nformulaic bonus funding percentage outcome.

Further, the\nCommittee considered the impact of risk\nfactors on the calculated annual cash\nincentive award funding and associated payout\nlevel that was well below target. Factoring in\nindividual performance and risk sensitivity\nThe Committee considers the performance of the\nbusiness lines managed by each executive\nofficer and that executive officer\u2019s\nindividual performance during the year. The\nCommittee also uses a formal \u201crisk scorecard\u201d\nassessment which, together with the individual\nperformance assessment, can result in downward\nor upward adjustments to each NEO\u2019s Bonus\nFunding Award Percentage to reflect that\nexecutive\u2019s demonstrated sensitivity to risk.\nThe Committee believes that it is important to\nretain the ability to recognize outstanding\nindividual performance and risk mitigation in\ndetermining Annual Cash Incentive Payouts, as\nwell as to acknowledge circumstances where\nindividual performance improvements are\nsuggested or where inappropriate risk-taking\nbehaviors have occurred. Modifications to our\nNEOs\u2019 Bonus Funding Award Percentage based on\ntheir individual performance and risk\nsensitivity have been used only occasionally,\nhowever, and have historically been modest in\nscope. 2023 individual performance and risk\nsensitivity actions: The Committee determined\nthat each NEO\u2019s applicable Final Bonus Funding\nPercentage appropriately reflected that\nexecutive\u2019s performance and contributions to\nthe company in 2023. Accordingly, no\nindividual performance-based modifications\nwere made to the NEO\u2019s Bonus Funding\nPercentages. Following an analysis of each\nNEO\u2019s risk scorecard results, the Committee\ndid not make any risk-based modifications to\nthe NEOs\u2019 Final Bonus Funding Percentages.\n2023 Annual Cash Incentive Payout results: The\nresulting payouts made to the NEOs in March\n2024 for 2023 performance under the AEIP (and\nfor Mr. Stern, the AEIP and AIP) were as\nfollows: 1. Mr. Stern\u2019s 2023 annual cash\nincentive payout reflects a pro-rated amount\ncalculated based on his target award level of\n$450,000 under the AIP for the period from\nJanuary 1, 2023 through August 31, 2023, and\nhis target award level of $1,260,000 under the\nAEIP for the period from September 1, 2023 to\nDecember 31, 2023. For purposes of calculating\nthe pro-rata portion of his AIP award, the\nCorporate Result was weighted 35% and the\nBusiness Line Result was weighted 65%. For\npurposes of calculating the pro-rata portion\nof his AEIP award, the Corporate Result was\nweighted 50% and the Business Line Result was\nweighted 50%.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             51    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nLong-term incentive awards Establishing the\nstructure of the equity awards Long-term,\nequity-based compensation represents the most\nsignificant portion of our NEOs\u2019 total\ncompensation package. The Committee uses\nequity awards to align the NEOs\u2019 interests\nwith those of long-term shareholders. In 2023,\n63% of our CEO\u2019s target total direct\ncompensation and between 60% and 65% of our\nother NEOs\u2019 (excluding Mr. Stern) target total\ndirect compensation consisted of equity\nawards. The Committee currently grants equity\nawards to executive officers under the U.S.\nBancorp 2015 Stock Incentive Plan. In 2023,\n60% of the value of each executive officer\u2019s\nlong-term incentive award was granted in the\nform of PRSUs that will cliff vest (if earned)\non the third anniversary of the grant date,\nfollowing a three-year performance period, and\n40% was granted in the form of RSUs that vest\nratably over three years from the date of\ngrant. Cash dividends on unvested PRSUs accrue\nduring the performance period but are only\npaid at vesting on shares earned, if any, by\nthe executives. The mix of performance-based\nand time-based equity awards, with the mix\nmore heavily weighted toward performance-based\nequity, is designed to motivate achievement of\nfinancial objectives while encouraging\nretention and stock ownership. Setting the\nvalue of the equity awards Each year in\nJanuary, the Committee determines the dollar\nvalue of the long-term incentive awards to be\ngranted to the executive officers, with the\ngrants being made on a pre-determined date in\nFebruary or March. In setting each year\u2019s\naward amounts, the Committee considers the\nrelative market position of the awards and the\ntotal compensation for each executive, the\nproportion of each executive\u2019s total direct\ncompensation to be delivered as a long-term\nincentive award, internal pay equity,\nexecutive performance and changes in\nresponsibility, retention, and corporate\nperformance. 2023 equity value actions: The\nCommittee increased the value of the long-term\nincentive awards granted to the NEOs in 2023\nto align the NEOs\u2019 total compensation more\nclosely with the opportunities available to\nexecutives in similar roles at companies in\nour peer group relative to our size, giving\nconsideration to the impact of our MUFG Union\nBank acquisition in December 2022.\n                                              \n               Va\u2026               V\u2026           \n               of\u2026               o\u2026           \n               aw\u2026               a\u2026           \n               in                in           \n    NEO        20\u2026               2\u2026           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n    An\u2026        $    10\u2026          $   10\u2026      \n    Ce\u2026                                       \n    Te\u2026                                       \n    R.         $    4,\u2026          $   4,\u2026      \n    Do\u2026                                       \n    Gu\u2026        $    3,\u2026          $   3,\u2026      \n    Ke\u2026                                       \n    Sh\u2026                                       \n    M.         $    3,\u2026          $   3,\u2026      \n    Ko\u2026                                       \n    Ti\u2026                                       \n    A.         $    3,\u2026          $   3,\u2026      \n    We\u2026                                       \n    Je\u2026                                       \n    H.         $    3,\u2026          $   4,\u2026      \n    von                                       \n    Gi\u2026                                       \n                                              \nBased on his prior role as President of the\nGlobal Corporate Trust and Custody business,\nand prior to becoming Chief Financial Officer\non September 1, 2023, Mr. Stern received RSUs\nwith a grant-date value of $600,000 in March\n2023. As previously disclosed by the company\non a Form 8-K filed on August 23, 2023, the\nCommittee determined that Mr. Stern would be\neligible to receive a long-term equity award\nconsistent with the structure and terms of\nother executive officers in 2024. Selecting\nthe performance metrics for the PRSU awards\nThe number of PRSUs earned at the end of the\nthree-year performance period is determined by\na formula that uses a comparison of our actual\nROE result to target-level ROE, as well as our\nROE performance relative to our peer financial\ninstitutions. ROE is used as the performance\nmetric because: \u25b6 it directly reflects the\nreturn generated by the company on our\nshareholders\u2019 investment; \u25b6 it encompasses\nprofitability, efficiency, balance sheet\nmanagement and financial leverage, and is\namong the most widely used indicators of\nfinancial performance in our industry; \u25b6\nachieving a high ROE requires an appropriate\nbalance between achieving the highest return\non invested capital and managing risk within\nthe company\u2019s established risk tolerance\nlevels; and \u25b6 using ROE as a performance\nmetric aligns the interests of the executives\nwith those of long-term shareholders because\nsustaining a high ROE is a primary driver of\nstrong earnings growth and long-term\nvaluation.\n                                              \n    52      U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nThe Committee uses a performance matrix,\nillustrated below, that reflects both absolute\nand relative ROE scales to determine the final\nPRSU award amounts earned during the\nperformance period. Target levels of both\nabsolute and relative ROE are established,\nwith maximum and minimum levels also\nidentified. Earn-out amounts are determined\nusing straight-line interpolation. The\nCommittee believes that the PRSU earn-out\nstructure provides an important balance\nbetween rewarding the achievement of absolute\nperformance goals and strong relative\nperformance. Executives are not rewarded for\npoor performance simply because members of our\nfinancial peer group have even worse\nperformance, nor are they rewarded for\nexceeding expectations if performance relative\nto peers is substandard. In addition, by using\na sliding scale for each ROE performance\nmetric, the matrix takes into account the\namount of variance from the ROE target and\npeer group ROE results, rewarding performance\nwhile mitigating the incentive for excessive\nrisk taking that may result from an \u201call-or-\nnothing\u201d award. Setting the levels of absolute\nand relative ROE for the PRSU performance\nmatrix The target and maximum ROE levels\nselected by the Committee for the three-year\nperformance period are based on the ROE range\nincluded in the company\u2019s profitability goals\npublicly communicated prior to the grant date.\nThe Company\u2019s ROE result may be adjusted from\nreported results to normalize the effect of\nsignificant notable items such as merger-\nrelated charges in the event of an\nacquisition. Since 2020, ROE results include\nadjustments related to the impact of the CECL\naccounting standard. The adjustments eliminate\nthe volatility of the accounting standard\nrelated to changes in the allowance for credit\nlosses, while including net charge-offs\nrelated to actual credit losses experienced.\nThese CECL-related adjustments to the ROE\ncalculation for the PRSU awards were adopted\nby the Committee in January 2020, when we\nadopted the accounting standard. The Committee\nalso establishes a sliding scale of ROE\nachieved relative to the ROE of our financial\npeer group, which consists of the following\ninstitutions: Bank of America, Citizens, Fifth\nThird, J.P. Morgan, KeyCorp, PNC, Regions,\nTruist Financial, and Wells Fargo. This group\nis used by the company for financial\ncomparison purposes because these companies,\nalong with U.S. Bancorp, are the largest\nfinancial services companies based in the\nUnited States that provide broadly comparable\nretail and commercial banking services. The\nROE performance matrix provides that\nperformance above the median of peers will\nincrease the payout otherwise earned based on\nour absolute ROE result, while performance\nbelow the median of peers will reduce the\naward payout. The company\u2019s absolute and\nrelative ROE results for each of the three\nyears within the performance period are\napplied to the performance matrix to produce a\npercentage of target PRSUs results for that\nyear. At the end of the performance period,\nthe percentage results for the three years\nwill be averaged to determine the percentage\nof target PRSUs earned and eligible to vest\nupon the third anniversary of the grant date.\nResults of PRSUs earned 2021-2023: In March\n2021, PRSUs were granted for the 2021-2023\nperformance period using the following ROE\nperformance matrix:\n                                              \n                                              \n                        \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                   \u200b     \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                   \u200b     \u200b       \u2026              \n                   \u2026    \u200b       \u200b               \n                   \u2026    \u200b       \u200b               \n                   \u2026    \u200b       \u200b               \n                   \u200b     \u200b       \u2026              \n                               \u2026              \n                        \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                   \u200b     \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                        \u2026                     \n                                              \nThe absolute and relative ROE performance\nduring the three-year period was as follows:\n                                              \n                            P\u2026        E\u2026      \n      Y\u2026  \u200b        R\u2026        g\u2026        o\u2026      \n                            r\u2026        p\u2026      \n                            At                \n      2\u2026  \u200b        1\u2026        or        1\u2026      \n                            a\u2026                \n                            7\u2026                \n                            At                \n      2\u2026  \u200b        1\u2026        or        1\u2026      \n                            a\u2026                \n                            7\u2026                \n                            At                \n      2\u2026  \u200b        1\u2026        or        1\u2026      \n                            a\u2026                \n                            7\u2026                \n          F\u2026                                  \n          e\u2026                                  \n          p\u2026                                  \n          f\u2026                                  \n          P\u2026                          1\u2026      \n          a\u2026                                  \n          g\u2026                                  \n          in                                  \n          2\u2026                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             53    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\n1.

Source: S&P Capital IQ based on company\nfilings and market data; for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023; excludes taxable-equivalent\nadjustments There were no changes to the 2022\npeer group; accordingly, the 2023 peer group\nconsisted of the same peer companies. The\nCommittee selects compensation peer group\ncompanies that it believes represent our most\nmeaningful competitors in the marketplace for\nexecutive talent. The Committee also reviews\nand uses compensation data from a large group\nof diversified financial services companies as\nan additional point of comparison. As a result\nof this ongoing analysis and resulting\ncompensation adjustments, our executive\ncompensation positioning is generally within\nmarket range, recognizing that several\npositions are unique to our company and do not\nhave clear market comparisons. Stock ownership\nand retention requirements The Committee\nbelieves that ownership of our common stock by\nour executive officers directly aligns their\ninterests with those of our other shareholders\nand helps balance the incentives for risk\ntaking inherent in equity-based awards.

This new policy is in\naddition to, and does not replace, the\nexisting policy. Change-in-control provisions\nfor executive officers \u25b6 No cash benefit:The\nexecutive officers are not entitled to receive\nany cash payments upon a change-in-control of\nour company, with or without a subsequent\ntermination in employment, except as provided\nby broad-based severance plans generally\navailable to our employees. None of our NEOs\nhave employment or standalone change-in-\ncontrol agreements. \u25b6 No single-trigger equity\nacceleration:The equity award agreements for\nexecutive officers provide that a change-in-\ncontrol of our company would not trigger\naccelerated vesting of an executive officer\u2019s\noutstanding equity awards unless his or her\nemployment was involuntarily terminated within\n12 months after the change-in-control other\nthan for cause. Hedging and pledging policy\nThe company\u2019s Insider Trading Policy prohibits\nexecutive officers and directors of the\ncompany from hedging shares of the company\u2019s\ncommon stock, including, but not limited to,\nusing short sales, puts, calls, prepaid\nvariable forwards, equity swaps, collars and\nexchange funds. The policy also prohibits\nexecutive officers and directors from pledging\nshares of the company\u2019s common stock as\ncollateral for a loan or holding the company\u2019s\ncommon stock in a margin account. Health and\nother benefits Our NEOs are eligible to\nreceive health benefits under the same plans\nand on the same terms available to our other\nemployees, matching contributions to their\nU.S. Bank 401(k) Savings Plan accounts on the\nsame basis as our other employees, and\nretirement benefits that are earned over their\ncareer with the company. Our NEOs and certain\nother employees are eligible to participate in\nour Deferred Compensation Plan. We provide\nadditional information on these plans in the\n\u201cExecutive compensation\u201d section below. In\naddition, the principal perquisites we may\nprovide to our executive officers include\nreasonable home security system services,\nparking and financial planning expense\nreimbursement, business club dues, and limited\npersonal use of corporate aircraft and\ncorporate housing for out-of-state commuting\npurposes. NEOs do not receive gross-up\npayments for tax liabilities resulting from\nperquisites, except in relation to certain\nrelocation expenses. Risk considerations\nOverview:Prudent risk taking is an integral\npart of any business strategy, and our\ncompensation program is not intended to\nencourage management decisions that completely\neliminate risk. Rather, the combination of\nvarious elements in our program is designed to\nencourage appropriate sensitivity to risk and\nmitigate the potential to reward risk taking\nthat may produce short-term results that\nappear in isolation to be favorable, but that\nmay undermine the successful execution of our\nlong-term business strategy and negatively\naffect shareholder value. Our compensation\npractices are also designed to reward\nperformance while maintaining our core\ncommitment to customer service and ethical\nprinciples. Together with the company\u2019s\nprocesses for strategic planning, its internal\ncontrol over financial reporting and other\nfinancial and compliance policies and\npractices, the design of our compensation\nprogram helps to discourage management actions\nthat demonstrate insensitivity to risk. Role\nof management:As a large financial services\ncompany, we are subject to ongoing regulatory\nreviews of incentive compensation policies and\npractices. We routinely undertake a thorough\nrisk analysis of every incentive compensation\nplan\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             57    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nof the company, the individuals covered by\neach plan and the risks inherent in each\nplan\u2019s design and implementation. We also\nconduct validation and back-testing activities\nto ensure that our compensation plans are\ncorrectly risk rated, that they are designed\nto adequately mitigate inherent risk, and that\neach plan is administered effectively. The\nIncentive Review Committee was created to\noversee that review and to provide more\ncomprehensive oversight of the relationship\nbetween the various kinds of risk we manage\nand our company\u2019s incentive compensation plans\nand programs. The Incentive Review Committee\nmeets throughout the year and reviews and\napproves all company incentive plans. The\nIncentive Review Committee reviews incentive\nplan elements such as risk controls, plan\nparticipants, performance measures,\nperformance and payout curves or formulas, how\ntarget level performance is determined\n(including whether any thresholds and caps\nexist), how frequently payouts occur, and the\nmix of fixed and variable compensation that\nthe plan delivers. The plans and programs are\nalso reviewed from the standpoint of\nreasonableness (for example, how target pay\nlevels compare to similar plans for similar\nemployee groups at other companies, and how\npayout amounts relate to the results that\ngenerate the payments), how well the plans and\nprograms are aligned with the company\u2019s goals\nand objectives and with its risk appetite, and\nfrom an overall standpoint, whether these\nplans and programs represent an appropriate\nmix of short-term and long-term compensation.\nAs part of this review by the Incentive Review\nCommittee, our management team, including\nsenior risk officers and individuals from the\ncompensation department, have identified the\nrisks inherent in these programs and have\nmodified plans and controls where appropriate\nto mitigate certain potential risks. For\nexample, most business line incentive\ncompensation plans with a credit component\ntrack early defaults, or defaults that occur\nwithin the first 12 months, and must include a\nprovision that allows the company to offset\nfuture payments by the amount of the\npreviously paid incentives related to the\nearly default. In addition, a \u201crisk scorecard\u201d\nassessment measuring adequacy of risk\nmanagement is undertaken for senior\nmanagement-level employees who have the\nindividual ability to pose material risk to\nthe company, including the executive officers;\nall employees who have credit responsibility\nand who participate in annual corporate cash\nincentive plans; and all employees who, as\npart of a group, can engage in risk-taking\nbehavior that could be material to the company\nand who participate in annual corporate cash\nincentive plans. This analysis serves as the\nbasis for annual cash incentive plan\nadjustments for these employees. Annually, the\nIncentive Review Committee also addresses risk\nevents that pose a material adverse impact to\nthe company or business line to determine\nwhether an event should trigger cancellation\nof equity awards. The Incentive Review\nCommittee has reviewed its process with the\nCommittee and discussed the areas where\ncompensation-related risks were being\naddressed by plan modifications, or were\nmitigated by internal controls or otherwise.\nRole of the Board:The Committee also conducts\nan annual review of the compensation packages\nand components for the executive officers. The\nCommittee assesses the incentives for risk\ntaking contained in the compensation program\nand balances them with the other goals of the\ncompensation program. In evaluating the\nincentives for risk taking in compensation\nplans and policies for executive officers, the\nCommittee considered the following risk-\nmitigating aspects of those plans and\npolicies:\n                                              \n      Overall executive compensation          \n      program risk mitigation factors         \n      \u25b6                                       \n      Long-term incentive focus:The           \n      majority of the total compensation      \n      received by executive officers is       \n      in the form of equity awards with       \n      multi-year vesting schedules,           \n      which helps to ensure that              \n      executives have significant value       \n      tied to long-term stock price           \n      performance and mitigates               \n      incentives to manage the company        \n      with an excessive focus on              \n      short-term gain.                        \n      \u200b                                        \n      Annual cash incentive risk              \n      mitigation factors                      \n      \u25b6                                       \n      Specific risk sensitivity               \n      analysis:The Committee considers        \n      corporate risk management               \n      performance in determining the          \n      bonus funding\u00a0percentage.

Name and principal position\nMr. Dolan served as our Chief Financial\nOfficer from January 1, 2023, through August\n31, 2023, and then assumed a broader role as\nour Chief Administration Officer on September\n1, 2023. Mr. Stern is our current Chief\nFinancial Officer and assumed the role on\nSeptember 1, 2023. Mr. von Gillern served in\nhis role as Vice Chair, Technology and\nOperations Services, until September 1, 2023;\nhe remained employed by the company and served\nas an advisor to the Chief Executive Officer\nthrough December 31, 2023. The amounts\nreported here for 2023 reflect compensation\npaid or awarded for the entire year for each\nof these NEOs. 2. Stock awards\nThe amounts in this column are calculated\nbased on the number of time-based restricted\nstock units, or RSUs, and performance-based\nrestricted stock units, or PRSUs, awarded and\nthe fair market value of U.S. Bancorp common\nstock on the date the award was made in\naccordance with Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification\n(ASC) Topic 718. See Note 18 to our\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nassumptions used to calculate our stock\nawards. The 2023 values in this table reflect\nthe fair market value of each officer\u2019s RSUs\nplus the target payout for the PRSUs on the\ngrant date. The number of PRSUs subject to\neach of these awards will be determined after\na three-year performance period beginning on\nJanuary 1, 2023, and ending December 31, 2025.\nDepending on our company performance during\nthe\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             61    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\n\nperformance period, 0% to 150% of the target\nnumber of PRSUs granted to the NEOs will be\nearned. The fair market value of RSUs plus the\nmaximum potential payout amounts for the PRSUs\non the grant date were as follows: (i) Mr.\nCecere, $13,650,000; (ii) Mr. Stern did not\nreceive PRSUs in 2023, so his maximum value of\n$600,000 is reflected in the table; (iii) Mr.\nDolan, $5,850,000; (iv) Ms. Kedia, $4,550,000;\n(v) Mr. Kotwal, $4,160,000; (vi) Mr. Welsh,\n$4,550,000; and (vii) Mr. von Gillern,\n$5,200,000. 3. Non-equity incentive plan\ncompensation\nThe 2023 amounts in this column represent the\nAnnual Executive Incentive Plan, or AEIP,\nawards (and for Mr. Stern, the aggregate\nprorated amounts under the AIP and AEIP). Such\namounts were determined in January 2024 based\non 2023 performance and paid out in March\n2024. The AEIP and these awards are discussed\nabove in the \u201cCompensation discussion and\nanalysis\u201d section of this proxy statement. 4.\nChange in pension value and non-qualified\ndeferred compensation earnings\nThe amounts in this column represent the\nincrease in the actuarial net present value of\nall future retirement benefits under the U.S.\nBank Pension Plan and the U.S. Bank Non-\nQualified Retirement Plan. A number of factors\ncan cause the amounts reflected in this column\nto vary significantly, including volatility in\nthe discount rate applied to determine the\nvalue of future payment streams and changes to\nmortality assumptions. The change in present\nvalue amounts reported for 2023 are\nsignificantly larger than those reported for\n2022 for certain NEOs. These larger increases\nin value are due to the decline in discount\nrates in 2023; year-end 2023 rates were\nroughly 45 basis points lower than for year-\nend 2022, compared with a roughly 255 basis\npoint increase from the prior year (which\nsignificantly reduced the 2022 values). Other\nfactors contributing to the higher change\namounts are increases in pay, age and service.\nThe net present values of the pension benefits\nas of December 31, 2023, used to calculate the\nnet change in pension benefits were determined\nusing the same assumptions used to determine\nour pension obligations and expense for\nfinancial statement purposes. See Note 17 to\nour consolidated financial statements included\nin our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthese specific assumptions. Additional\ninformation about our Pension Plan and Non-\nQualified Retirement Plan is included below\nunder the heading \u201cPension benefits.\u201d We have\nnot provided above-market or preferential\nearnings on any nonqualified deferred\ncompensation and, accordingly, no such amounts\nare reflected in this column. 5. All other\ncompensation\nThe following table describes each component\nof the All Other Compensation column for\nfiscal year 2023:\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \na. The amounts for Ms. Kedia and Mr. Kotwal\nrepresent expenses for corporate housing in\nMinnesota, air travel expenses related to use\nof aircraft fractionally-owned by the company\nor commercial flights, and related parking and\nground transportation when commuting between\ntheir out-of-state residences and our\ncorporate headquarters in Minnesota. b. The\namount for Mr. Cecere represents the\nincremental cost for personal use of company-\nowned aircraft for one flight taken by Mr.\nCecere and his spouse. The amounts for Ms.\nKedia and Mr. Welsh represent matching\ncontributions under our charitable matching\ngifts program, which is available to all of\nour employees. The aggregate incremental cost\nfor corporate-owned aircraft is determined by\nmultiplying the total number of personal\nflight hours by the direct variable operating\ncosts of the aircraft per hour including costs\nrelated to fuel, landing and parking fees, and\ncrew expenses. For fractionally-owned\naircraft, including amounts referenced in\nfootnote (a) above, the incremental cost is\ndetermined by multiplying the total number of\npersonal flight hours by the contracted hourly\nand fuel charges. As the aircraft are used\nprimarily for business travel, we do not\ninclude fixed costs that do not change based\non usage, such as crew salaries, aircraft\nacquisition costs and monthly management fees\nfor fractionally-owned aircraft. In addition,\na NEO\u2019s spouse might accompany him or her on a\nbusiness-related flight on a company-owned\naircraft if a seat on that aircraft would\notherwise be empty. There is no incremental\ncost to our company for such flights. Our NEOs\nare occasionally permitted to use sporting and\ncultural events tickets. As such tickets were\npreviously acquired by our company for\nbusiness entertainment, there is no\nincremental cost to our company for the use of\nsuch tickets.\n                                              \n    62      U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\n\nGrants of plan-based awards The following\ntable summarizes the equity and non-equity\nplan-based awards granted to the NEOs in\nfiscal year 2023.

Estimated future payouts under non-equity\nincentive plan awards\nThese columns show the potential payments for\neach NEO under our AEIP (and for Mr. Stern,\nthe aggregate prorated amounts under the AIP\nand AEIP) for 2023 performance. Actual annual\ncash incentive payout amounts are determined\nin accordance with a formula based on\ncorporate EPS performance and business line\npretax income performance, ranging in each\ncase from 0% to 200% of target levels, subject\nto adjustment for individual performance and\nrisk sensitivity. Additional information\nregarding how the payout amounts for these\nawards are determined is included above in\n\u201cCompensation discussion and analysis \u2014 Annual\ncash incentive awards,\u201d and the actual amounts\npaid based on 2023 performance are reported\nabove in the \u201cNon-equity incentive plan\ncompensation\u201d column in the \u201cSummary\ncompensation table\u201d. 2.

The measurement date and material actuarial\nassumptions applied in quantifying the present\nvalue of the current accrued benefits are\ndiscussed in Note 17 to our consolidated\nfinancial statements included in our 2023\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. These assumptions\ninclude the use of a 5.07% discount rate for\nthe supplemental and excess plans and a 5.16%\ndiscount rate for the qualified pension plan.\nThe mortality assumptions used are based on\nthe white collar PRI-2012 mortality table\nprojected generationally using the MP-2021\nimprovement scale. The average pay used for\nthe benefit calculations was historical pay\nthrough the measurement date (December 31,\n2023). The amounts in this column were\ncalculated based on the earliest age at which\nthe applicable NEO is entitled to receive\nunreduced retirement benefits and ignore any\nvesting requirements. The earliest age of\nunreduced retirement benefits is 65 for all\nour NEOs, and all are currently vested in 100%\nof their pension benefits. 2. In the event of\nthe death of one of the NEOs in this table, a\npre-established percentage of the NEO\u2019s\npension benefits will be paid to the NEO\u2019s\nbeneficiary. The actual percentage paid to the\nbeneficiary is dependent on the form of\npayment of benefits elected by the NEO. The\ndefault percentage is 50% to the NEO\u2019s spouse.\nAn additional lump sum death benefit may be\npayable based on certain actuarial\ncalculations. The benefit amounts shown in\nthis column assume that each NEO will reach\nhis or her retirement age. Due to the level of\ndiscount rates (or any accelerated service),\nthe present value of death benefits commencing\nimmediately would exceed the total present\nvalue of accumulated benefits shown in this\ncolumn by the following amounts: (i) Mr.\nCecere, $1,718,749; (ii) Mr. Stern, $130,515;\n(iii) Mr. Dolan, $0; (iv) Ms. Kedia, $179,843;\n(v) Mr. Kotwal, $58,631; (vi) Mr. Welsh,\n$61,257; and (vii) Mr. von Gillern, $119,590.\n3. Mr. Cecere is 100% vested and eligible to\nbegin receiving his benefits upon retirement.\nIf any of the vested benefits are paid before\nMr. Cecere reaches age 65, the benefits are\nreduced by certain early retirement benefit\nformulas specified in the applicable plan for\neach year prior to Mr. Cecere\u2019s reaching age\n65. These early retirement benefit formulas\nreduce the annual pension benefit amount\npayable to Mr. Cecere due to the longer\nbenefit payment period related to the earlier\ncommencement of benefits. Per the standard\nprovisions of the supplemental plan, upon his\nattainment of age 60, Mr. Cecere became\neligible for five accelerated years of service\ncredit for service to age 65. Mr. Cecere is\ncurrently eligible for two accelerated years\nof service credit, worth approximately $1.7\nmillion; this value will gradually be\nreflected in the table above and will have no\nextra value if he works to age 65. There is no\neffect on the applicable early reductions or\nbenefit timing noted above.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             67    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\nUnderstanding our Pension Benefits Table This\nsection provides information regarding the\ncompany\u2019s retirement programs in which our\nNEOs participate, which include the U.S. Bank\nPension Plan and the U.S. Bank Non-Qualified\nRetirement Plan. Our company sponsors the U.S.\nBank Pension Plan (the Pension Plan) which was\ncreated through the merger of the former U.S.\nBancorp\u2019s career average pay defined benefit\nplan, the U.S. Bancorp Cash Balance Pension\nPlan (which we refer to as the Old Cash\nBalance Plan), and the former Firstar\nCorporation\u2019s non-contributory defined benefit\nplan, which was primarily a final average pay\nplan (the Firstar Plan). The Firstar Plan was\nfrozen to new-hire employees on July 3, 2008,\nand to rehire employees on November 15, 2009.\nParticipation in the Pension Plan requires one\nyear of service with U.S. Bancorp or its\naffiliates. Employees who were hired or\nrehired prior to July 3, 2008, or November 15,\n2009, respectively, could elect to (i)\ncontinue to accrue benefits under the final\naverage pay formula of the Pension Plan, or\n(ii) accrue benefits under the U.S. Bank 2010\nCash Balance Plan (the 2010 Cash Balance\nPlan), which represents the cash balance\nportion of the Pension Plan. In the event of\nno election, participants defaulted into the\n2010 Cash Balance Plan. Participants that\nelected to receive pension benefits or\ndefaulted into the 2010 Cash Balance Plan had\ntheir existing benefits in the pension plan\nfrozen and earn future benefits under the cash\nbalance formula, under which participants\nreceive (i) annual pay credits based on\neligible pay multiplied by a percentage\ndetermined by their age and years of service,\nand (ii) an annual interest credit. For\nparticipants who elected to continue to accrue\nbenefits under the final average pay formula,\nbenefits are calculated using a final average\npay formula, based upon the participant\u2019s\nyears of service and average salary of the\nfive-consecutive-year period in which\ncompensation was the highest during the ten\nyears prior to retirement. Normal retirement\nage is 65. Vesting of benefits requires five\nyears of service for benefits under the final\naverage pay formula and three years of service\nfor benefits under the 2010 Cash Balance Plan.\nMr. Dolan is the only NEO (of those eligible\nat the time) who elected to remain covered by\nthe final average pay formula; all other NEOs\nare covered by the 2010 Cash Balance Plan.\nAlthough no new benefits accrued under the Old\nCash Balance Plan and Firstar Plan for service\nafter 2001, benefits previously earned under\nthose plans have been preserved and will be\npart of a retiree\u2019s total retirement benefit.\nIn order to preserve the relative value of\nbenefits that use the final average pay\nformula, subsequent changes in compensation\n(but not in service) may increase the amount\nof those benefits. Messrs. Cecere, Dolan and\nvon Gillern have earned benefits under the Old\nCash Balance Plan that will be included in\ntheir ultimate retirement benefits. The U.S.\nBank Non-Qualified Retirement Plan As federal\nlaws limit the amount of compensation we may\nconsider when determining benefits payable\nunder qualified defined benefit pension plans,\nwe also maintain a non-contributory, non-\nqualified retirement plan, the U.S. Bank Non-\nQualified Retirement Plan, which we refer to\nas the Non-Qualified Plan. The Non-Qualified\nPlan pays the excess pension benefits that\nwould have been payable under our current and\nprior qualified defined benefit pension plans\nif the federal limits were not in effect. As\npart of her compensation package, Ms. Kedia\nreceives an additional 23 years of service\nwhen calculating her pay credits in the Non-\nQualified Plan. The additional years of\nservice represent her service with her prior\nemployer. Messrs. Cecere, Dolan and von\nGillern are eligible for a supplemental\nbenefit, which is also paid under the Non-\nQualified Plan, that augments benefits earned\nunder the Pension Plan and the non-qualified\nexcess benefits discussed above. The\nsupplemental benefit ensures that eligible\nNEOs receive a total retirement benefit equal\nto a fixed percentage of the NEO\u2019s final\naverage cash compensation. For purposes of\nthis supplemental benefit, final average cash\ncompensation includes annual base salary,\nannual cash bonuses and other cash\ncompensation awards as determined by the\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee.\nEligibility for these supplemental benefits\nhas been determined by this committee based on\nindividual performance and level of\nresponsibility. Vesting of the supplemental\nbenefit is generally subject to certain\nconditions, including that an NEO provide a\ncertain number of years of service determined\nby the Compensation and Human Resources\nCommittee. Mr. Cecere is eligible for an\namount of total retirement benefits (comprised\nof components described above) at age 65 equal\nto 55% of the average cash compensation during\nhis final three years of service, reduced by\nhis estimated retirement benefits from Social\nSecurity. Mr. Cecere is fully vested in his\nsupplemental benefit. In the case of Messrs.\nDolan and von Gillern, their supplemental\nbenefits were frozen in 2001. Accordingly, Mr.\nDolan has a frozen monthly annuity of $522, in\nwhich he is fully vested, payable as early as\nhis termination date, and Mr. von Gillern also\nhas a frozen monthly annuity benefit of $138,\nin which he is fully vested, payable as early\nas his termination date.\n                                              \n    68      U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\n\nIn accordance with his election, Mr. Cecere\u2019s\nsupplemental benefit will be paid in the form\nof a lump sum. For the supplemental benefits\npayable to Messrs. Dolan and von Gillern, the\nstandard form is either a lump sum or a joint\nand survivor annuity, depending on the present\nvalue of the lump sum at retirement. As the\npresent value of the supplemental benefit for\nMessrs. Dolan and von Gillern is currently\nless than $400,000, in accordance with plan\nrules, their supplemental benefit will default\nto payment in a lump sum. Messrs. Dolan and\nvon Gillern each have the option to make an\nelection to receive their supplemental benefit\nas an annuity if the election is made 12\nmonths prior to their respective termination\ndates, they are over age 55, and the present\nvalue of the supplemental benefit exceeds\n$50,000. The amount of the lump sum\ndistribution equals the actuarial equivalent\nof the annuity form of payment and is\ncalculated using substantially similar\nactuarial assumptions as for our pension plan\nobligations discussed in Note 17 to our\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The means\nof calculating the various annuity benefits\nare described in the pension plan.\nNonqualified deferred compensation Under the\nU.S. Bank Executive Employees Deferred\nCompensation Plan (2005 Statement) (the\nExecutive Deferred Compensation Plan), members\nof our senior management, including all of our\nNEOs, may choose to defer all or a part of\ntheir annual base salary and annual cash\nincentive payments.

The measurement\nfunds are merely measuring tools to determine\nthe amount by which account balances will be\ndebited or credited to reflect deemed\ninvestment returns on deferred compensation.\nAlthough the plan administrator has\nestablished procedures permitting a\nparticipant to reallocate deferred amounts\namong these investment alternatives after the\ninitial election to defer, the election to\ndefer is irrevocable, and the deferred\ncompensation will not be paid to the\nparticipant until his or her retirement or\nearlier termination of employment. At that\ntime, the participant will receive, depending\nupon the payment choice and investment\nalternatives selected by the participant,\npayment of the amounts credited to the\nparticipant\u2019s account under the plan in a\nlump-sum payment or in annual installments\nover 5, 10, 15 or 20 years. Payments are made\nratably in cash from each of the investment\nalternatives in which the participant has a\nbalance, except the U.S. Bancorp stock fund,\nwhich is generally paid in shares. If a\nparticipant dies before the entire deferred\namount has been distributed, the undistributed\nportion will be paid to the participant\u2019s\nbeneficiary in a single lump sum. The benefits\nunder the plan are otherwise not transferable.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             69    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\n\nThe following table summarizes information\nwith respect to the participation of the NEOs\nin any defined contribution or other plan that\nprovides for the deferral of compensation on a\nbasis that is not tax-qualified.

Ms. Kedia\ndeferred cash compensation earned for her 2018\nand 2022 performance, for a total deferred\ncontribution of $473,875.50. These amounts\nwere included in her compensation reported in\nthe Summary Compensation Table in our proxy\nstatements for 2018 and 2022. 3. Mr. Kotwal\ndeferred cash compensation each year from 2018\nto 2023, for a total deferred contribution of\n$2,951,281. This amount includes deferred\nsalary from 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023,\nand deferred incentive pay earned for his\n2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022 performance. This\ndeferred compensation was reported in the\nSummary Compensation Table in our proxy\nstatement for the applicable years for which\nhe was a NEO. 4. Mr. Welsh deferred cash\ncompensation each year from 2017 to 2023, for\na total deferred contribution of $1,403,246.\nOf this amount, $1,275,444 is deferred salary\nfrom 2019 and 2020 and deferred incentive pay\nearned for his 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022\nperformance. This deferred compensation was\nreported in the Summary Compensation Table in\nour proxy statement for the applicable years.\nMr. Welsh\u2019s total deferred contribution also\nincludes $127,802 in deferred salary from 2017\nand 2018 and deferred incentive pay earned for\nhis 2018 performance that was not included in\nthe Summary Compensation Table in our proxy\nstatement, as Mr. Welsh was not a NEO in 2017\nand 2018. Potential payments upon termination\nor change-in-control General None of our NEOs\nhave employment or standalone change-in-\ncontrol agreements. Any NEO whose employment\nis voluntarily or involuntarily terminated is\nentitled to the payments or other benefits\nthat have accrued and are vested under the\nbenefit plans discussed above in this proxy\nstatement. Except as is specifically described\nbelow with respect to disability, death,\ntermination of employment following a change-\nin-control (as defined in the equity award\nagreements), qualifying severance or early\nretirement, no NEO is entitled to any other\nbenefits upon any employment termination or\nchange-in-control scenario, except as provided\nby broad-based severance plans generally\navailable to our employees. In accordance with\napplicable SEC rules, information presented\nfor Mr. von Gillern, who retired from the\ncompany on December 31, 2023, is only included\nfor his retirement. Payments made upon\ndisability Cash payments:Under the terms of\nthe Non-Qualified Plan, Mr. Cecere is eligible\nfor an annual disability benefit that is equal\nto 60% of his current annual cash\ncompensation. The definition of disability is\nsimilar to that used for the broad-based\ndisability program described below. The\ndefinition of annual cash compensation is the\nsame definition as is used to calculate\nsupplemental pension benefits under this plan,\nwithout using a five-year average. His\nagreement under the non-qualified retirement\nplan provides that Mr. Cecere is eligible to\nreceive disability payments through the\nearlier of the cessation of his disability or\nreaching his normal retirement age. The\nCompany amended the U.S. Bank Long-Term\nDisability Plan, our broad-based disability\nprogram, effective January 1, 2024.\nInformation included below reflects the\nbenefits that would have been available to\neach NEO other than Mr. Cecere\n                                              \n    70      U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation under\nthe prior plan in effect in December 2023.\nUnder that prior plan, which was insured by\nHartford Life and Accident Insurance Company,\nMessrs. Stern, Dolan, Kotwal, and Welsh and\nMs. Kedia were eligible for an annual\ndisability benefit of $150,000 (i.e., 50% of\nannual cash compensation, capped at $300,000\nof compensation). Optional additional\ndisability insurance was available for\npurchase by those NEOs. The definition of\ndisability is generally that a participant is\nunable to perform material duties of his or\nher own occupation for 24 months following the\nsix-month elimination period, or any\noccupation after 24 months, and suffers a loss\nof at least 20% in pre-disability earnings.\nThe definition of annual cash compensation is\nactual compensation for the one-year period\nending September 30. The disability benefit\nfor any NEO would have been reduced by any\nbenefits payable under the Pension Plan,\nSocial Security and worker\u2019s compensation. The\nduration of disability payments under the\nprior plan was dependent upon the age of the\nparticipant when the disability occurs.\nBecause each of Messrs. Stern, Dolan, Kotwal,\nand Welsh and Ms. Kedia was under age 63 as of\nDecember 2023, payments under the prior plan\nwould have continued through the earlier of\nthe cessation of their disability or reaching\ntheir normal retirement age, assuming all\nother plan conditions are met. Effect on\nequity awards:If any NEO\u2019s employment is\nterminated due to disability, our equity award\nagreements provide that the vesting and other\nterms of those awards will continue as if the\ntermination of employment did not occur.\nUnvested equity awards continue to be subject\nto the applicable award terms, including any\nconfidentiality and non-solicitation agreement\nbetween the company and the NEO, performance-\nbased cancellation provisions, and applicable\nrecovery or clawback provisions. Noncompliance\nwith the terms of such agreement may result in\nthe forfeiture of unvested amounts. As of\nDecember 29, 2023, the amounts payable per the\naward schedule, subject to the terms and\nconditions of the applicable award agreement,\nare the same as the PRSU and RSU values\nincluded for each NEO (other than Mr. von\nGillern) under the \u2018\u2018Payments upon death\u201d\ncolumn in the table below. Payments made upon\ndeath Cash payments:NEOs are eligible to\nreceive life insurance benefits under the same\nplans available to our other employees. Their\nbenefit is equal to annual cash compensation,\ncapped at $300,000. In addition, optional term\nlife insurance is available for purchase. As\nthis benefit is generally available to all\nsalaried employees and does not discriminate\nin scope, terms, or operation in favor of the\nNEOs, the value has not been quantified in the\nPotential payments upon disability, death, or\ntermination after a change-in-control table.\nEffect on equity awards:Our equity award\nagreements provide for the acceleration of any\nunvested award upon death. For all RSUs and\nPRSUs, outstanding units will vest at target\nupon death. All of our NEO\u2019s stock options\nhave vested, and the stock option award\nagreements provide that the administrator of\nthe NEO\u2019s estate has the earlier of a three-\nyear period after death or the original ten-\nyear term of the options during which to\nexercise the options. Payments upon\ntermination after a change-in-control Cash\npayments:None of our NEOs is entitled to any\ncash payments in connection with a change-in-\ncontrol of U.S. Bancorp. Effect on equity\nawards:Our equity award agreements provide for\nthe acceleration of vesting of any unvested\naward if an NEO\u2019s employment is involuntarily\nterminated within 12 months after a change in\ncontrol of U.S. Bancorp other than for cause\n(as defined in the equity award agreements),\nwith PRSUs vesting at target upon a qualifying\ntermination (as defined in the equity award\nagreements). All of our NEO\u2019s stock options\nhave vested. Stock options may be exercised at\nany time during the 12 months following the\nNEO\u2019s termination or the original ten-year\nterm of the option, if earlier. Payments upon\nqualifying severance Broad-based cash\nseverance payments:Each NEO is covered under\nthe company\u2019s broad-based U.S. Bank Severance\nPay Program. Benefits under that program are\nbased on an employee\u2019s weekly compensation\nrate based on salary, years of service and, if\napplicable, target annual bonus percentage\n(prorated based on the number of months worked\nin the calendar year of a qualifying\ntermination). Severance benefits are subject\nto the execution of a release in favor of the\ncompany and certain post-termination\nrestrictions. In no case will total severance\npay exceed two times the individual\u2019s cash\ncompensation during the year immediately\npreceding employment termination. If their\nemployment had terminated on December 29,\n2023, cash severance amounts would have been\npayable in the following amounts for each NEO\n(other than Mr. von Gillern): (i) Mr. Cecere,\n$6,075,000; (ii) Mr. Stern, $1,879,231; (iii)\nMr. Dolan, $2,505,000; (iv) Ms. Kedia,\n$1,812,500; (v) Mr. Kotwal, $1,750,000; (vi)\nMr. Welsh, $1,812,500. Effect on equity\nawards:If an NEO has been continuously\nemployed since the grant date and (i) has a\nqualifying termination under the U.S. Bank\nSeverance Pay Program at least six months from\nthe grant date of the applicable award and\n(ii) the scheduled vesting date of the award\nis on or before the second anniversary date of\nthe qualifying severance, then any unvested\nPRSUs and RSUs would continue to vest per the\naward\u2019s scheduled vesting dates on or before\nthe second anniversary\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             71    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\n\nof the qualifying severance and the final\nnumber of any PRSUs would be determined based\non the applicable performance period. For\nMessrs. Cecere and Dolan, who have met the\ndefinition of retirement eligibility under\napplicable equity awards, all unvested PRSUs\nand RSUs would continue to vest per the award\nschedule and have the same values included for\neach under the \u201cPayments upon death\u201d column in\nthe table below. Unvested equity awards\ncontinue to be subject to the applicable award\nterms, including any confidentiality and\nnonsolicitation agreement between the company\nand the NEO, performance-based cancellation\nprovisions, and applicable recovery or\nclawback provisions. Noncompliance with the\nterms of such agreement may result in the\nforfeiture of unvested amounts. If each of the\nfollowing NEO\u2019s employment had terminated due\nto a qualifying severance on December 29,\n2023, the values of their PRSU and RSU awards\nthat would continue to vest per schedule were\nas follows (see footnote 2 below for\ncalculation assumptions): (i) Mr. Stern,\n$793,496; (ii) Ms. Kedia, $5,121,019; (iii)\nMr. Kotwal, $4,880,253; and (iv) Mr. Welsh,\n$5,121,019. Payments upon early retirement The\nbenefit amounts for each NEO in the Pension\nbenefits table above assume that each NEO will\nreach his or her retirement age. Due to the\nlevel of discount rates, the present value of\nearly retirement benefits commencing\nimmediately would exceed the values in the\nPension benefits table by the following\namounts: (i) Mr. Cecere, $1,718,749; (ii) Mr.\nStern, $23,237; (iii) Mr. Dolan, $0; (iv) Ms.\nKedia, $18,864; (v) Mr. Kotwal, $11,079; (vi)\nMr. Welsh, $10,982; and (vii) Mr. von Gillern,\n$0. The incremental value for Mr. Cecere\nincludes two accelerated years of service for\nthis SERP benefit upon reaching age 60, and\nhis benefits are all now payable upon\nseparation of service. As Messrs. Stern,\nDolan, Kotwal, Welsh and von Gillern and Ms.\nKedia have not yet attained age 62, only their\nqualified retirement benefits and\ngrandfathered 409A benefits can be\naccelerated. Quantification of estimated\npayments and benefits The following table\nshows potential annual cash payments to the\nNEOs upon disability and the potential\nbenefits the NEOs could accrue through\naccelerated equity vesting upon death or\ninvoluntary termination of employment (other\nthan for cause) following a change-in-control\nof U.S. Bancorp. No information regarding\npension amounts payable to the NEOs is shown\nin the following table; applicable pension\namounts payable to NEOs are discussed above\nunder the heading \u201cPension benefits.\u201d The\namounts shown assume that termination was\neffective as of December 29, 2023 (the last\nbusiness day of the year), and are estimates\nof the amounts that would be paid to the NEOs\nupon termination, in addition to the base\nsalary and cash incentive payments earned by\nthem during 2023. The actual amounts to be\npaid can only be determined at the time of an\nNEO\u2019s termination.

The\nratio stated above is a reasonable estimate\ncalculated in a manner consistent with Item\n402(u) of Regulation S-K. In making this pay\nratio disclosure, other companies may use\nassumptions, estimates, and methodologies\ndifferent than ours; as a result, the\nforegoing information may not be directly\ncomparable to the information provided by\nother companies in our peer group or\notherwise. Median employee identification and\ncompensation calculation We identified our\nmedian employee based on compensation paid\nduring 2023 to all of our U.S.-based\nemployees, other than our CEO, who were\nemployed by us on December 31, 2023. We\nconsidered any person to whom we delivered a\nForm W-2 Wage and Tax Statement (Form W-2) for\nservices performed in 2023 to be a U.S.-based\nemployee, which includes full-time, part-time,\nand temporary workers. For purposes of\ndetermining the compensation paid to the\nemployees under consideration, we used\nearnings subject to Medicare tax as reported\nin Box 5, \u201cMedicare wages and tips,\u201d on each\nemployee\u2019s 2023 Form W-2. We did not annualize\nthe compensation of anyone who was employed by\nus for only part of the year. In accordance\nwith the \u201c de minimis\u201d exemption provided in\nItem 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we excluded\nfrom consideration all of our non-U.S.\nemployees. As of December 29, 2023, the last\nbusiness day of the year, we had 3,217\nnon-U.S. employees, representing approximately\n4.3% of our total U.S. and non-U.S. workforce\nof approximately 75,465 active employees on\nthat date. The excluded employees work in the\nfollowing jurisdictions: Ireland (1,141),\nPoland (1,020), United Kingdom (502), Canada\n(202), Spain (136), Lithuania (77), Luxembourg\n(55), Germany (50), Norway (21), Sweden (12),\nand Cayman Islands (1).

Our adoption of CECL creates the\npotential for significant accounting\nvolatility and uncertainty with respect to the\nloan loss reserve that is often dependent upon\na number of judgmental factors and economic\nassumptions. In an effort to measure\nperformance based on actual credit losses, the\ncompany excludes changes in the allowance\ndriven by these factors and includes net\ncharge-offs in the determination. Analysis of\nthe Information Presented in the Pay versus\nPerformance Table While the company utilizes\nseveral performance measures to align\nexecutive compensation with company\nperformance, not all of those company measures\nare presented in the Pay versus Performance\ntable set forth above. Moreover, the company\ngenerally seeks to incentivize positive long-\nterm performance and, therefore, does not\nspecifically align the company\u2019s performance\nmeasures with compensation that is actually\npaid (as computed in accordance with Item\n402(v) of Regulation S-K) for a particular\nyear. In accordance with Item 402(v), the\ncompany is providing the following\ndescriptions of the relationships between\ninformation presented in the Pay versus\nPerformance table.\n                                              \n    TSR:                                      \n    TSR has the most direct and               \n    significant impact on CEO and NEO         \n    compensation actually paid.

At least 65% of CEO                \n    compensation and more than 60% of NEO     \n    compensation is directly impacted by      \n    TSR.

The 2015 Plan\nprovides that no non-employee director may\nreceive an equity award or awards with an\naggregate grant date fair value in excess of\n$600,000 in any calendar year. The restricted\nstock units were fully vested at the time of\ngrant, but the underlying shares will not be\ndelivered until the director ceases to serve\non the Board. Each non-employee director may\nelect to have all of his or her shares\ndelivered promptly following cessation of\nservice or to have the shares delivered in ten\nannual installments. Each non-employee\ndirector is entitled to receive additional\nfully vested restricted stock units having a\nfair market value equal to the amount of\ndividends he or she would have received had\nrestricted stock been awarded instead of\nrestricted stock units. Director stock\nownership requirements The Compensation and\nHuman Resources Committee has established\nstock ownership requirements for each non-\nemployee director equal to five times the\nvalue of the annual cash retainer. New\ndirectors must satisfy this minimum ownership\nlevel within five years of joining the Board.\nAs of December 31, 2023, all of the directors\nserving at that time were in compliance with\nour stock ownership guidelines or were on\ntrack to be in compliance by the end of his or\nher five-year compliance period. Deferred\ncompensation plan participation Under the U.S.\nBank Outside Directors Deferred Compensation\nPlan (2005 Statement) (the Director Deferred\nCompensation Plan), our non-employee directors\nmay elect to defer all or a part of their cash\nfees. Cash fees that are deferred are deemed\nto be invested in one of several investment\nfunds, including a U.S. Bancorp common stock\nfund, as selected by the participant. The\nterms and investment alternatives of the\nDirector Deferred Compensation Plan are\nsubstantially the same as those of the\nExecutive Deferred Compensation Plan.

The Audit Committee has\nestablished a policy for pre-approving the\nservices provided by our independent auditor\nin accordance with the auditor independence\nrules of the SEC and the PCAOB. This policy\nrequires the review and pre-approval by the\nAudit Committee of all audit and permissible\nnon-audit services provided by our independent\nauditor and an annual review of the financial\nplan for audit fees. To ensure that auditor\nindependence is maintained, the Audit\nCommittee annually pre-approves the audit\nservices to be provided by our independent\nauditor and the related estimated fees for\nsuch services, as well as the nature and\nextent of specific types of audit-related, tax\nand other non-audit services to be provided by\nthe independent auditor during the year. As\nthe need arises, other specific permitted\nservices are pre-approved on a case-by-case\nbasis during the year. A request for pre-\napproval of services on a case-by-case basis\nmust be submitted by our Controller or Chief\nRisk Officer. These requests are required to\ninclude information on the nature of the\nparticular service to be provided, estimated\nrelated fees and management\u2019s assessment of\nthe impact of the service on the auditor\u2019s\nindependence. The Audit Committee has\ndelegated to its chair pre-approval authority\nbetween meetings of the Audit Committee. Any\npre-approvals made by the chair must be\nreported to the Audit Committee. The Audit\nCommittee will not delegate to management the\npre-approval of services to be performed by\nour independent auditor. All of the services\nprovided by our independent auditor in 2023\nand 2022, including services related to the\nAudit-Related Fees, Tax Fees and All Other\nFees described above, were approved by the\nAudit Committee under its pre-approval\npolicies after consideration of any impact of\nthese services on the auditor\u2019s independence.\n                                              \n    82      U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 3 \u2014 Ratification of\nselection of independent auditor\n\nProposal 3 \u2014 Ratification of selection of\nindependent auditor The Audit Committee has\nselected EY as our independent auditor for the\n2024 fiscal year. EY began serving as our\nindependent auditor for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2003. Our Audit Committee has\ncarefully considered the selection of EY as\nour independent auditor and has also\nconsidered whether there should be regular\nrotation of the independent external audit\nfirm. The Audit Committee annually reviews\nEY\u2019s independence and performance in\nconnection with the committee\u2019s determination\nof whether to retain EY or engage another firm\nas our independent auditor. In determining\nwhether to reappoint EY as U.S. Bancorp\u2019s\nindependent auditor, the Audit Committee took\ninto consideration a number of factors,\nincluding: \u25b6 the qualifications of EY, the\nlead audit partner, and other key personnel; \u25b6\nthe length of time the firm has been engaged;\n\u25b6 the quality of the historical and recent\nperformance on the U.S. Bancorp audit; \u25b6 EY\u2019s\ncapability and expertise in handling the\nbreadth and complexity of our operations; \u25b6\nexternal data on audit quality and\nperformance, including the results of PCAOB\ninspection reports on EY and EY\u2019s response to\nthe matters raised in those reports, as well\nas actions to continue to enhance the quality\nof its audit practices; \u25b6 the appropriateness\nof EY\u2019s fees on an absolute basis and as\ncompared to peer firms; and \u25b6 the advisability\nand potential impact of selecting a different\nindependent audit firm. In accordance with SEC\nrules and company policies, lead and\nconcurring audit partners are subject to a\nmaximum of five years of service in that\ncapacity. The process for selecting the audit\nfirm\u2019s lead engagement partner involves\nmeetings with the candidates for the role by\nmanagement; review and discussion with the\nchair of the Audit Committee, who meets with\nselected candidates; and further discussion\nwith the full committee. A new lead engagement\npartner was selected in 2023 for service on\nthe company\u2019s audit beginning in 2024. The\nmembers of the Audit Committee believe the\ncontinued retention of EY to serve as our\nindependent auditor is in the best interests\nof our company and its shareholders. While we\nare not required to do so, we are submitting\nthe selection of EY to serve as our\nindependent auditor for the 2024 fiscal year\nfor ratification in order to ascertain the\nviews of our shareholders on this appointment.\nIf the selection is not ratified, the Audit\nCommittee will reconsider its selection.\nRepresentatives of EY are expected to attend\nthe annual meeting, will be available to\nanswer shareholder questions, and will have\nthe opportunity to make a statement if they\ndesire to do so.\n                                              \n        \u200b                             FOR      \n        The Board of Directors                \n        recommends that you vote              \n        \u201cFOR\u201d ratification of the             \n        selection of Ernst &                  \n        Young LLP as the                      \n        independent auditor of                \n        U.S. Bancorp for the 2024             \n        fiscal year.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             83    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 4 \u2014 Approval of the\nU.S. Bancorp 2024 Stock Incentive Plan\nProposal 4 \u2014 Approval of the U.S. Bancorp 2024\nStock Incentive Plan We are asking our\nshareholders to approve the U.S. Bancorp 2024\nStock Incentive Plan (2024 Plan). Upon the\nrecommendation of the Compensation and Human\nResources Committee (referred to throughout\nthis Proposal 4 as the Committee), our Board\nof Directors adopted the 2024 Plan on February\n21, 2024, subject to approval by our\nshareholders. Executive Summary \u25b6 Adopt the\nU.S. Bancorp 2024 Stock Incentive Plan,\nincluding the number of shares available for\ngrant under the 2024 Plan. \u25b6 The terms of the\nplan are aligned with shareholders\u2019 interests,\nincluding minimum vesting requirement, no\nautomatic \u201csingle-trigger\u201d change in control\nvesting for employees upon a change in\ncontrol, no liberal share counting for awards\nof stock options or stock appreciation rights\n(SARs), no use of discounted stock options or\nSARs, no repricing of stock options or SARs,\nand no use of reload options. \u25b6 We have strong\ncompensation governance and employee equity\naward practices, including clawback and\nrecovery features in all awards to employees.\nPurpose of the 2024 Plan Long-term equity\ncompensation plays an important part in U.S.\nBancorp\u2019s pay-for-performance philosophy. Our\ncompensation program emphasizes stock-based\ncompensation, encouraging our executive\nofficers and other employees and non-employee\ndirectors to think and act as long-term\nshareholders. The purpose of the 2024 Plan is\nto promote the interests of U.S. Bancorp and\nour shareholders by aiding us in attracting,\nretaining and motivating employees, officers\nand non-employee directors who we expect will\ncontribute to our future success. The 2024\nPlan is also intended to provide participants\nwith incentives to maximize their efforts on\nbehalf of U.S. Bancorp through stock-based\nawards that provide them with opportunities\nfor stock ownership. Shares Available for\nAwards We currently grant equity incentive\nawards (which at the present time consist of\nnon-qualified stock options, restricted stock\nunits and performance-based restricted stock\nunits) under the U.S. Bancorp 2015 Stock\nIncentive Plan (2015 Plan). The 2015 Plan is\nthe only U.S. Bancorp omnibus equity incentive\nplan under which shares are issued pursuant to\nequity incentive awards, and its term expires\non April 21, 2025. The 2024 Plan will replace\nthe 2015 Plan, and no further awards will be\nmade under the 2015 Plan following shareholder\napproval of the 2024 Plan. Outstanding awards\ngranted under the 2015 Plan shall continue in\neffect according to their terms. The aggregate\nnumber of shares of common stock that may be\nissued under all equity awards granted\npursuant to the 2024 Plan, subject to\nadjustment described below, will be equal to\n(i) 37,000,000 shares, plus(ii) any shares\nthat remain reserved for issuance under the\n2015 Plan as of the date of shareholder\napproval, plus(iii) any shares subject to any\noutstanding award under the 2015 Plan that,\nafter the date of shareholder approval, are\nterminated, surrendered, cancelled or\nforfeited for any reason without delivery of\nthe shares underlying such award. Reasons for\nAdopting the 2024 Plan Our Board of Directors\nhas adopted the 2024 Plan and recommends that\nit be approved by our shareholders.\nSpecifically, the Board of Directors is\nseeking shareholder approval of the 2024 Plan\nin order to meet NYSE listing requirements.\nThe 2024 Plan retains provisions from the 2015\nPlan that are considered desirable corporate\ngovernance features intended to protect the\ninterests of our shareholders and improves\nupon those features. These features include\nthe following: adoption of a requirement that\nall awards vest no sooner than one year after\ngrant (subject to limited exceptions that are\ndescribed more fully below); a double-trigger\nvesting provision that automatically\naccelerates the vesting of awards only if an\ninvoluntary termination of a participant\u2019s\nemployment occurs within one year following a\nchange in control of U.S. Bancorp; an annual\nlimit on the dollar value of equity awards\nmade to non-employee directors when aggregated\nwith the cash payments made to such non-\nemployee directors (as described more fully\nbelow); a requirement that awards are subject\nto\n                                              \n    84      U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 4 \u2014 Approval of the\nU.S. Bancorp 2024 Stock Incentive Plan\nclawback policies adopted by the company or\nrecoupment provisions contained in award\nagreements for the awards; a prohibition on\ncash buyouts of out-of-the-money options and\nstock appreciation rights; and a prohibition\non \u201creload\u201d options. If the 2024 Plan is not\napproved by our shareholders, the Committee\nwill continue to grant equity awards under the\n2015 Plan until it expires on April 21, 2025,\nand we would not be able to grant equity\nawards following termination of the 2015 Plan.\nWe would accordingly be at a disadvantage\nagainst our competitors for recruiting,\nretaining and motivating individuals critical\nto our success and could be forced to increase\ncash compensation, thereby reducing resources\navailable to meet our business needs.\nDetermination of Terms of the 2024 Plan As in\nthe case of the 2015 Plan, the 2024 Plan\npermits us significant flexibility in\ndetermining the types and specific terms of\nawards made to participants. This flexibility\nwill allow us to make future awards based on\nthen-current objectives for aligning\ncompensation with shareholder value. In\nassessing the appropriate terms of the 2024\nPlan, the Committee considered, among other\nthings, our compensation philosophy and\npractices, feedback from some of our largest\nshareholders and advice from Meridian\nCompensation Partners, LLC (Meridian), the\nCommittee\u2019s independent compensation\nconsultant. The Committee also considered\nguidelines relating to equity compensation\nplans published by major shareholder advisory\nfirms. Key Features of the 2024 Plan The\nfollowing features of the 2024 Plan continue\nor enhance features of the 2015 Plan that\nprotect the interests of our shareholders: \u25b6\nNo Evergreen Provision.The 2024 Plan does not\ncontain an \u201cevergreen\u201d provision that will\nautomatically increase the number of shares\nauthorized for issuance under the 2024 Plan. \u25b6\nNo Liberal Share \u201cRecycling.\u201dAny shares\nsurrendered to pay the exercise price or\nsatisfy tax withholding will not be added back\n(\u201crecycled\u201d) to the 2024 Plan. The 2024 Plan\nalso provides that the gross number of stock\nappreciation rights exercised, and not just\nthe net shares issued upon exercise or\nsettlement, will count against the aggregate\nlimit on the number of shares that may be\nissued under the 2024 Plan. \u25b6 Limit on Awards\nto Non-employee Directors.The 2024 Plan\nimposes an aggregate limit on the value of\nawards that may be granted, when aggregated\nwith cash fees that may be paid, to each non-\nemployee director for services as a non-\nemployee director in any year to $750,000 in\ntotal value, except that the independent\ndirectors of the Board of Directors may\nincrease this limit to $1,000,000 for a non-\nexecutive chair or lead independent director\nof the Board of Directors. \u25b6 Minimum Vesting\nRequirements.The 2024 Plan requires a one-year\nminimum vesting schedule for awards, except\nthat up to 5% of the shares reserved for\nissuance (subject to certain adjustments) are\navailable for grant without regard to this\nrequirement, and awards granted to non-\nemployee directors on the date of an annual\nshareholders\u2019 meeting satisfy this requirement\nif they provide for vesting at the\nshareholders\u2019 meeting immediately following\nthe grant date (but in any event not less than\n50 weeks following the date of grant). This\nlimitation additionally does not limit the\nBoard of Directors\u2019 ability to accelerate the\nvesting of awards in connection with the\nretirement or termination of employment due to\ndeath or disability of the award holder. \u25b6 No\nDiscounted Stock Options or Stock Appreciation\nRights.Stock options and stock appreciation\nrights must have an exercise price equal to or\ngreater than the fair market value of our\ncommon stock on the date of grant. \u25b6 No\nRepricing of Stock Options or Stock\nAppreciation Rights.The 2024 Plan prohibits\nthe repricing of stock options and stock\nappreciation rights (including a prohibition\non cash buyouts of out-of-the-money stock\noptions or stock appreciation rights) without\nshareholder approval. \u25b6 \u201cDouble-Trigger\u201d\nChange in Control Vesting.The 2024 Plan does\nnot provide for \u201csingle-trigger\u201d change in\ncontrol vesting. Instead, the 2024 Plan\nprovides for the automatic acceleration of\nvesting of a participant\u2019s award only if the\nparticipant experiences an involuntary\ntermination of employment following a change\nin control of U.S. Bancorp. \u25b6 No Liberal\nChange in Control Definition.The 2024 Plan\nprovides that a change in control based on\nspecified transactions does not occur until\nthe transactions have been consummated. In\naddition, the threshold at which an\nacquisition by a single person or entity of\nshares of U.S. Bancorp common stock would\ntrigger a change in control is 35% of our\noutstanding shares.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             85    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 4 \u2014 Approval of the\nU.S. Bancorp 2024 Stock Incentive Plan\n\n\u25b6 Awards Subject to Forfeiture or\nClawback.Awards under the 2024 Plan will be\nsubject to U.S. Bancorp forfeiture policies\nand any clawback provisions contained in\napplicable award agreements, including the\nclawback policy that U.S. Bancorp adopted\npursuant to requirements of the NYSE. \u25b6 No\nChange in Control/280G Tax Gross-Ups.The 2024\nPlan does not provide for any excise tax\ngross-up payments on \u201cparachute payments,\u201d and\nas a general business matter, the Company does\nnot provide for such gross-ups in other\narrangements. \u25b6 Prohibition Against \u201cReload\u201d\nOptions.Reload options are additional stock\noptions that are granted automatically upon\nthe exercise of previously granted stock\noptions. Stock options granted under the 2024\nPlan may not include a reload feature. \u25b6\nIndependent Committee Administration.The 2024\nPlan will be administered by a committee of\nthe Board of Directors comprised entirely of\nindependent directors. Determination of Number\nof Shares for the 2024 Plan In setting the\nnumber of proposed shares issuable under the\n2024 Plan, the Committee and our Board of\nDirectors considered U.S. Bancorp\u2019s historical\nequity compensation practices (including the\ntotal number of shares underlying existing\nequity awards), U.S. Bancorp\u2019s three-year\naverage share usage (commonly referred to as\n\u201cburn rate\u201d), and dilution. The Committee and\nthe Board of Directors also considered these\nfactors in assessing the number of shares\nlikely to be needed for future awards.\nMeridian assisted in the analysis resulting in\nthe determination of the number of shares to\nbe reserved for issuance under the 2024 Plan.\nThe Committee and Board of Directors expect\nthat the number of shares being requested for\nauthorization under the 2024 Plan will be\nsufficient to provide projected equity\nincentives to our employees for approximately\nfive years, based on our historical rate of\nequity awards under the 2015 Plan. However,\nthe actual duration of the shares reserve will\ndepend on currently unknown factors, such as\nchanges in participation, future grant\npractices, competitive market practices,\nacquisitions and divestitures, forfeiture\nrates, and the company\u2019s stock price. The 2024\nPlan does not set the number of shares subject\nto equity awards that will be granted in\nfuture years. In setting each year\u2019s award\namounts for executive officers, the Committee\nconsiders the following: the relative market\nposition of the awards and the total\ncompensation for each executive, the\nproportion of each executive\u2019s total\ncompensation to be delivered as a long-term\nincentive award, internal pay equity,\nexecutive performance and changes in\nresponsibility, retention concerns, and\ncorporate performance. Similar considerations\nare taken into account in granting awards to\nparticipants who are not executive officers.\nEquity awards to non-employee directors have\nhistorically been granted at levels intended\nto be competitive, taking into account current\nmarket conditions. Burn Rate Burn rate, a\nmeasure of the speed at which companies use\nshares available for grant under their equity\ncompensation plans, is an important factor for\ninvestors concerned about shareholder\ndilution. The burn rate for a given year is\ndefined as the number of shares of common\nstock subject to equity awards granted,\ndivided by the weighted average number of\nshares of common stock outstanding. In setting\nand recommending to shareholders the number of\nshares to be authorized under the 2024 Plan,\nthe Committee and the Board of Directors\nconsidered U.S. Bancorp\u2019s burn rates for the\npast three years. Our burn rates for the three\nyears ended December 31 of 2023, 2022, and\n2021 are shown in the table below:\n                                              \n            Year                 Burn Rate    \n            2023          0.36%  \u200b             \n            2022          0.28%  \u200b             \n            2021          0.30%  \u200b             \n      Three-Year          0.31%  \u200b             \n         Average                              \n                                              \nIn determining to adopt the 2024 Plan, the\nCommittee considered our \u201cburn rate\u201d and\n\u201coverhang,\u201d and the company believes that our\nhistorical share usage has been prudent and in\nthe best interest of our shareholders.\nOverhang The table below shows our potential\ndilution levels based on our shares of common\nstock outstanding as of December 31, 2023, the\nshares available for grant under all existing\nequity compensation plans as of December 31,\n2023, the new shares\n                                              \n    86      U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 4 \u2014 Approval of the\nU.S. Bancorp 2024 Stock Incentive Plan\n\nrequested for issuance under the 2024 Plan and\nour total equity awards outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The Board of Directors\nbelieves that the number of shares requested\nunder the 2024 Plan represents a reasonable\namount of potential equity dilution and will\nallow us to continue granting equity awards.\n                                              \n               Potential                      \n               Overhang                       \n               with                           \n               37,000,0\u2026                      \n               Requested                      \n               Shares                         \n    Stock                                     \n    Options    \u200b                 2,838,2\u2026      \n    Outstand\u2026                                 \n    Outstand\u2026                                 \n    Full       \u200b                 8,436,7\u2026      \n    Value                                     \n    Awards2                                   \n    Total                                     \n    Equity                                    \n    Awards     \u200b                 11,275,\u2026      \n    Outstand\u2026                                 \n    as of                                     \n    12/31/20\u2026                                 \n    Shares                                    \n    Available                                 \n    for Grant                                 \n    under the  \u200b                 14,957,\u2026      \n    2015 Plan                                 \n    as of                                     \n    12/31/20\u2026                                 \n    Shares                                    \n    Requested  \u200b                 37,000,\u2026      \n    for the                                   \n    2024 Plan                                 \n    Total                                     \n    Potential                                 \n    Overhang   \u200b                 63,232,\u2026      \n    under the                                 \n    2024                                      \n    Plan5                                     \n    Shares of                                 \n    Common                                    \n    Stock      \u200b                 1,557,9\u2026      \n    Outstand\u2026                                 \n    as of                                     \n    12/31/20\u2026                                 \n    Fully                                     \n    Diluted    \u200b                 1,621,2\u2026      \n    Shares6                                   \n    Potential                                 \n    Dilution                                  \n    as a                                      \n    Percenta\u2026                                 \n    of Fully   \u200b                    1.66%      \n    Diluted                                   \n    Shares as                                 \n    of                                        \n    12/31/20\u2026                                 \n    Incremen\u2026                                 \n    Potential                                 \n    Dilution                                  \n    of                                        \n    Requested                                 \n    37,000,0\u2026  \u200b                    2.24%      \n    Shares as                                 \n    a                                         \n    Percenta\u2026                                 \n    ofFully                                   \n    Diluted                                   \n    Shares                                    \n    Total                                     \n    Potential                                 \n    Dilution                                  \n    of                                        \n    Requested                                 \n    37,000,0\u2026  \u200b                    3.90%      \n    Shares as                                 \n    a                                         \n    Percenta\u2026                                 \n    of Fully                                  \n    Diluted                                   \n    Shares                                    \n                                              \n1.

The\nCommittee\u2019s authority to accelerate the\nexercisability of, or waive restrictions\nrelating to, any outstanding award (except for\naccelerations of exercisability or waiver of\nrestrictions in connection with a change in\ncontrol of the company or the death or\ndisability of a participant), is not\ndelegable. The Committee may also delegate to\nany appropriate officer or employee of U.S.\nBancorp responsibility for performing certain\nministerial functions under the 2024 Plan. The\nBoard of Directors may exercise the powers of\nthe Committee at any time, so long as its\nactions would not violate Rule 16b-3 under the\nExchange Act, applicable corporate law or\nstock exchange listing rules. No member of the\nBoard of Directors or the Committee or any\nperson to whom the Committee delegates\nauthority under the 2024 Plan will be liable\nfor any action or determination taken and made\nin good faith with respect to the 2024 Plan or\nany award granted under the 2024 Plan.

As of\nDecember 31, 2023, approximately 75,465\nemployees (on a full-time equivalent basis)\nand 12 non-employee directors were eligible to\nparticipate in the 2015 Plan. However,\nparticipation is discretionary and awards are\nsubject to approval by the Committee or\npursuant to any existing deligation of\nauthority. In 2023, we granted long-term\nequity compensation awards to approximately\n7,250 employees (on a full-time equivalent\nbasis), 15 current and former executive\nofficers (prior to retirement), and 12 non-\nemployee directors. Shares Available for\nAwards The aggregate number of shares of our\ncommon stock that may be issued under all\nstock-based awards made under the 2024 Plan,\nsubject to adjustment described below, will be\nequal to (i) 37,000,000 shares, plus(ii) any\nshares that remain reserved for issuance under\nthe 2015 Plan as of the date of shareholder\napproval of the 2024 Plan, plus(iii) any\nshares subject to any outstanding award under\nthe 2015 Plan that, after the date of\nshareholder approval of the 2024 Plan, are\nterminated, surrendered, cancelled or\nforfeited for any reason without delivery of\nthe shares underlying such award. All of the\nshares authorized for issuance under the 2024\nPlan may be used for stock options, stock\nappreciation rights and full value awards.\nEach share issued pursuant to any type of\naward will reduce the number of shares\navailable under the 2024 Plan by one share. If\nany shares subject to an award granted under\nthe 2024 Plan are not purchased or are\nforfeited or are reacquired by U.S. Bancorp,\nor if an award otherwise terminates or is\ncancelled without delivery of any shares, then\nthe number of shares counted against the\naggregate number of shares available for\nissuance under the 2024 Plan with respect to\nsuch award, to the extent of any forfeiture,\ntermination or cancellation, will again become\navailable for granting awards under the 2024\nPlan. The following shares will not be\navailable for future awards under the 2024\nPlan: (i) shares tendered by a participant or\nwithheld by the company in payment of the\nexercise price of an option under the 2024\nPlan or, after the effective date of the 2024\nPlan, in payment of the exercise price of an\noption under the 2015 Plan; (ii) shares\ntendered by a participant or withheld by the\ncompany to satisfy any tax withholding\nobligation with respect to an award under the\n2024 Plan or, after the effective date of the\n2024 Plan, to satisfy any tax withholding\nobligation with respect to an award under the\n2015 Plan; (iii) shares subject to a stock\nappreciation right under the 2024 Plan or,\nafter the effective date of the 2024 Plan, a\nstock appreciation right under the 2015 Plan,\nthat are not issued in connection with the\nsettlement on exercise thereof; or (iv) shares\npurchased in the open market with cash\nproceeds from the exercise of options under\nthe 2024 Plan or, after the effective date of\nthe 2024 Plan, from the exercise of options\nunder the 2015 Plan. Awards pursuant to which\nthe holder is not entitled to receive or\npurchase shares of our common stock will not\nbe counted against the aggregate number of\nshares available for awards under the 2024\nPlan. The 2024 Plan provides that, subject to\nadjustment (as described below), in any\ncalendar year, no non-employee director may be\ngranted awards with a maximum aggregate grant\ndate value that, taken together with any cash\nfees earned by the non-employee director for\nservices rendered during the calendar year,\nexceeds $750,000.

The\nnumber of shares authorized under the 2024\nPlan described above will be adjusted\nproportionally in the event of an\nextraordinary dividend or other distribution,\nincluding a stock split, or a combination or\nconsolidation of the outstanding shares into a\nlesser number of shares. In the event the\nshares are converted into or exchanged for a\ndifferent number or class of shares of stock\nor securities of U.S. Bancorp or of another\ncorporation, whether through recapitalization,\nreclassification, merger or other similar\ncorporate transaction or event such that an\nequitable adjustment would be required in\norder to prevent dilution or enlargement of\nthe benefits or potential benefits intended to\nbe provided under the 2024 Plan, the number of\nshares described above will be adjusted\nproportionally, and an equitable adjustment\nwill be made to each share subject to an\noutstanding award such that no dilution or\nenlargement of the benefits or potential\nbenefits occurs. Minimum Vesting Requirement\nThe 2024 Plan generally requires that no\nportion of awards vest before the one-year\nanniversary of the date of grant. This\nrequirement does not apply to awards granted\nto non-employee directors on the date of the\ncompany\u2019s annual shareholder meeting if the\nawards also vest on the date of company\u2019s\nannual shareholder meeting immediately\nfollowing the date of grant. Additionally, the\nCommittee may grant awards without regard to\nthe minimum vesting requirement with respect\nto a maximum of five percent of the available\nshare reserve authorized for issuance under\nthe 2024 Plan. This minimum vesting period\nrequirement does not limit the ability of the\nCommittee to accelerate the vesting of an\naward in the event of a participant\u2019s death,\ndisability, or retirement (including\nretirement eligibility) or the occurrence of a\nchange in control. Types of Awards and Terms\nand Conditions The 2024 Plan permits the\ngranting of: \u25b6 stock options that are not\nqualified under Section 422 of the Internal\nRevenue Code (Code); \u25b6 stock appreciation\nrights; \u25b6 restricted stock and restricted\nstock units; \u25b6 performance awards; \u25b6 dividend\nequivalents; \u25b6 stock awards not subject to\nrestrictions; and \u25b6 other stock-based awards.\nAwards may be granted alone, in addition to,\nin combination with or in substitution for,\nany other award granted under the 2024 Plan or\nany other compensation plan. Awards can be\ngranted for no cash consideration or for any\ncash or other consideration as may be\ndetermined by the Committee or required by\napplicable law. Awards may provide that upon\nthe grant or exercise thereof, the holder will\nreceive cash, shares of our common stock,\nother securities or property, or any\ncombination of these in a single payment or\ntransfer, in installments, or in a deferred\nbasis. The exercise price per share under any\nstock option and the grant price of any stock\nappreciation right may not be less than the\nfair market value of our common stock on the\ndate of grant of that option or stock\nappreciation right. The Committee may\ndesignate an exercise price for an option or\nstock appreciation right below fair market\nvalue on the date of grant if the option or\nstock appreciation right is granted in\nsubstitution for an option or stock\nappreciation right previously granted by an\nentity that is acquired or merged with U.S.\nBancorp or one of its affiliates.\nDeterminations of such fair market value will\nbe made pursuant to methods and procedures\nestablished by the Committee in accordance\nwith the 2024 Plan. Stock Options The holder\nof a stock option will be entitled to purchase\na number of shares of our common stock at a\nspecified exercise price during a specified\ntime period, all as determined by the\nCommittee. The option exercise price may be\npayable either in cash or, at the discretion\nof the Committee, in other securities or other\nproperty having a fair market value on the\nexercise date equal to the exercise price.\nOptions vest and become exercisable in\naccordance with a vesting schedule (or\nperformance-based vesting conditions)\nestablished by the Committee. The term of each\noption will be fixed by the Committee but\ncannot be longer than 10 years from the date\nof grant. The Committee does not have the\nauthority to grant an option which provides\nthat the participant shall be granted a new\noption (sometimes referred to as a \u201creload\noption\u201d) for a number of shares equal to the\nnumber of shares surrendered by the\nparticipant upon exercise of all or part of\nthe original option.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             89    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 4 \u2014 Approval of the\nU.S. Bancorp 2024 Stock Incentive Plan The\n2024 Plan does not authorize the grant of\nincentive stock options (i.e., stock options\nthat are qualified under Section 422 of the\nCode). It has been many years since U.S.\nBancorp has granted incentive stock options,\nand we do not intend to grant any incentive\nstock options in the future. Stock\nAppreciation Rights The holder of a stock\nappreciation right is entitled to receive the\nexcess of the fair market value (calculated as\nof the exercise date) of one share of our\ncommon stock over the grant price of the stock\nappreciation right. Stock appreciation rights\nvest and become exercisable in accordance with\na vesting schedule (or performance-based\nvesting conditions) established by the\nCommittee. The term of each stock appreciation\nright will be fixed by the Committee but\ncannot be longer than 10 years from the date\nof grant. Restricted Stock and Restricted\nStock Units The holder of restricted stock and\nrestricted stock units will be subject to\nrestrictions imposed by the Committee\n(including, for example, restrictions on the\nright to vote the restricted shares or units\nor to receive any dividends with respect to\nthe shares or units) for a specified time\nperiod determined by the Committee. After the\nrestrictions on restricted stock lapse or are\nwaived, the holder of restricted stock will be\nentitled to receive shares of our common\nstock. The holder of restricted stock units\nwill have the right, subject to any\nrestrictions imposed by the Committee, to\nreceive shares of our common stock at some\nfuture date determined by the Committee\nfollowing the lapse or waiver of the\nrestrictions and restricted period related to\nthe restricted stock units. Restricted stock\nand restricted stock units may be subject to\nperformance-based vesting restrictions. Except\nas otherwise determined by the Committee, if\nthe participant\u2019s employment or service as a\ndirector terminates during the vesting period\nfor any reason, the restricted stock and\nrestricted stock units that have not vested or\nsettled will be forfeited. Performance Awards\nThe Committee may grant performance awards\nunder the 2024 Plan. A performance award may\nbe denominated or payable in cash, shares\n(including restricted stock and restricted\nstock units), other securities, other awards\nor other property, or a combination thereof,\nand confers on the holder thereof the right to\nreceive payments, in whole or in part, upon\nthe achievement of performance goals during a\nperformance period as established by the\nCommittee. Performance awards may provide for\nthe adjustment of the number of shares of\nrestricted stock units earned by the\nparticipant under the performance award (or\ncash amount based on the value of the shares\nof our common stock) based on the extent to\nwhich performance goals are achieved. The\nterms and conditions of any performance award\nwill be determined by the Committee.\nPerformance goals may be based on business\ncriteria that we select to measure our level\nof performance (or the performance of an\naffiliate or line of business) during a\nperformance period, and may include the\nfollowing criteria: sales, revenue, costs,\nexpenses (including expense efficiency ratios\nand other expense measures), earnings\n(including one or more of net profit after\ntax, gross profit, operating profit, earnings\nbefore interest and taxes, earnings before\ninterest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\nand net earnings), earnings per share,\nearnings per share from continuing operations,\noperating income, pre-tax income, operating\nincome margin, net income, margins (including\none or more of gross, operating and net income\nmargins), returns (including one or more of\nreturn on actual, averaged or pro forma\nassets, net assets, earnings or net earnings,\nequity, investment, capital and net capital\nemployed), shareholder return (including total\nshareholder return relative to an index or\npeer group), stock price, growth of loans and\ndeposits, number of customers or households,\neconomic value added, cash generation, cash\nflow, unit volume, working capital, market\nshare, cost reductions, strategic plan\ndevelopment and implementation, strategic\ngoals or objectives (including objectives\nrelated to qualitative or quantitative\nenvironmental, social, or governance metrics)\nand/or any other applicable criteria as\ndetermined by the Committee. Such goals may\nreflect absolute entity or business unit\nperformance or a relative comparison to the\nperformance of a peer group of entities or\nother external measure of the selected\nperformance criteria. The Committee may adjust\nany evaluation of performance under the\napplicable goals to exclude the effect of\ncertain non-recurring events. Dividend\nEquivalents The holder of a dividend\nequivalent will be entitled to receive\npayments (in cash, shares of our common stock,\nother securities, other awards or other\nproperty) equivalent to the amount of cash\ndividends paid by us to our shareholders, with\nrespect to a number of shares determined by\nthe Committee. Dividend equivalents will be\nsubject to the terms of the 2024 Plan and any\naward agreements thereunder, as well as other\nterms and conditions determined by the\nCommittee. The Committee may not grant\ndividend equivalents in connection with grants\nof options, stock appreciation rights or other\nawards the value of which is based solely on\nan increase in the value of the shares of our\ncommon stock after the date of grant of such\naward. No dividend or dividend equivalent\npayments can be made to a participant with\nrespect to any award subject\n                                              \n    90      U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 4 \u2014 Approval of the\nU.S. Bancorp 2024 Stock Incentive Plan to\nperformance-based vesting conditions unless\nand until all conditions or restrictions\nrelating to such award (or portion thereof to\nwhich the dividend or dividend equivalent\nrelates) have been satisfied. Award agreements\nmay provide that dividend equivalents can\ncontinue to be awarded or credited with\nrespect to outstanding awards for participants\nwho have terminated their employment or\nservice with U.S. Bancorp and its affiliates\nuntil the awards are settled or paid out\naccording to their terms. Stock Awards The\nCommittee may grant unrestricted shares of our\ncommon stock, subject to terms and conditions\ndetermined by the Committee and the\nlimitations in the 2024 Plan and applicable\naward agreement. Other Stock-Based Awards The\nCommittee is also authorized to grant other\ntypes of awards that are denominated or\npayable in, valued in whole or in part by\nreference to, or otherwise based on or related\nto our common stock, subject to terms and\nconditions determined by the Committee and the\nlimitations in the 2024 Plan and applicable\naward agreement. Other stock-based award will\nnot contain a purchase right or an option-like\nfeature. Transferability of Awards Unless\notherwise provided by the Committee, awards\n(other than fully vested and unrestricted\nshares issued pursuant to awards) or rights\nunder awards granted under the 2024 Plan may\nonly be transferred by will or by the laws of\ndescent and distribution or pursuant to a\ndomestic relations order. Withholding All\nawards under the 2024 Plan will be subject to\napplicable U.S. federal (including FICA),\nstate and local, foreign or other tax\nwithholding requirements. We may require that\na participant or other person receiving or\nexercising awards pay an amount sufficient to\nsatisfy the tax withholding requirements, or\nwe may deduct from other wages or compensation\npaid by us the amount of any withholding taxes\ndue with respect to such awards. We may also\ntake any other actions that the Committee\ndeems advisable to enable us to satisfy our\nwithholding tax and other tax obligations with\nrespect to any award made under the 2024 Plan.\nThe Committee may permit or require that our\ntax withholding obligation with respect to\nawards paid in shares of our common stock be\npaid by having shares withheld up to an amount\nthat does not exceed the participant\u2019s\napplicable withholding tax rate for U.S.\nfederal (including FICA), state and local,\nforeign country, or other tax liabilities\n(which, unless the Committee determines\notherwise, will be at the minimum rate). In\naddition, the Committee may, in its\ndiscretion, and subject to such rules as the\nCommittee may adopt, allow participants to\nelect to have such share withholding applied\nto all or a portion of the tax withholding\nobligation arising in connection with any\nparticular grant. Prohibition on Repricing\nAwards Without the approval of our\nshareholders, the Committee will not reprice,\nadjust or amend the exercise price of any\noptions or the grant price of any stock\nappreciation rights previously awarded,\nwhether through amendment, cancellation or\nexchange for cash or another award, a\nreplacement grant or any other means, except\nin connection with a change in control,\nextraordinary stock dividend or other\ndistribution, including a stock split, merger\nor other similar corporate transaction or\nevent, in order to prevent dilution or\nenlargement of the benefits, or potential\nbenefits intended to be provided under the\n2024 Plan. In addition, U.S. Bancorp may not\nrepurchase options for cash from a participant\nif the current fair market value of the shares\nunderlying the options is lower than the\nexercise price per share of the options, or\nrepurchase stock appreciation rights for cash\nfrom a participant if the current fair market\nvalue of the shares underlying the stock\nappreciation rights is lower than the grant\ndate price per share of the stock appreciation\nrights. Clawback or Recoupment All awards\nunder the 2024 Plan are subject to (i) the\nterms of any clawback, recovery, or similar\npolicy of U.S. Bancorp in effect from time to\ntime, including the clawback policy required\nto be implemented by the NYSE, whether\napproved before or after the date of grant of\nthe award and (ii) any applicable share\ntrading policies and other policies approved\nor implemented by the Committee from time to\ntime. Subject to applicable law, (a) awards\nare not considered earned, and the eligibility\nrequirements with respect to awards are not\nconsidered met, until all requirements of the\n2024 Plan, the applicable award agreement, and\nany clawback policy are met and (b) we may\noffset amounts payable under the 2024 Plan in\nthe event that a participant has an\noutstanding clawback, recoupment, or\nforfeiture obligation to U.S. Bancorp. Effect\nof Qualifying Termination Unless otherwise set\nforth in an applicable award agreement, upon a\n\u201cqualifying termination\u201d (as defined below),\nthe time-based vesting conditions relating to\nthe exercisability of an option or stock\nappreciation right and the lapse of any\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy             91    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 4 \u2014 Approval of the\nU.S. Bancorp 2024 Stock Incentive Plan\nrestrictions relating to any other award will\nbe waived, and the time-based vesting of such\nawards will be accelerated. The award\nagreement governing an award subject to\nperformance-based vesting will provide\nwhether, and to what extent, (i) the shares of\nrestricted stock or restricted stock units\nsubject to the award will be deemed earned and\n(ii) options or stock appreciation rights will\nbecome exercisable, if a qualifying\ntermination occurs during the performance\nperiod. For purposes of the 2024 Plan,\n\u201cqualifying termination\u201d means a participant\u2019s\ntermination of employment with U.S. Bancorp by\nthe company for any reason other than \u201ccause\u201d\n(as defined in the 2024 Plan) within 12 months\nfollowing a \u201cchange in control\u201d (as defined\nbelow). However, such termination will not be\na qualifying termination if (i) U.S. Bancorp\nhas notified the participant in writing more\nthan 30 days prior to the announcement date of\nthe transaction giving rise to the change in\ncontrol that participant\u2019s employment is not\nexpected to continue for more than 12 months\nfollowing the date of such notification, and\nparticipant\u2019s employment is in fact terminated\nwithin such 12-month period, or (ii) the\nparticipant has announced in writing that the\nparticipant intends to terminate his or her\nemployment prior to the date the company\nprovides the participant with written notice\nthat sets forth a date on which the\nparticipant\u2019s employment will be terminated. A\nqualifying termination will also be deemed to\noccur if a participant\u2019s employment with any\nentity that has assumed the participant\u2019s\naward (or provided the participant with a\nsubstitute award) in connection with a change\nin control transaction is terminated by such\nentity for any reason other than cause within\n12 months following the change in control. For\npurposes of the 2024 Plan, \u201cchange in control\u201d\nmeans in general terms (i) the acquisition by\na person or entity of 35% or more of the then\noutstanding shares of common stock of U.S.\nBancorp or the combined voting power of the\nthen outstanding voting securities of U.S.\nBancorp entitled to vote generally in director\nelections (subject to certain excepted\ntransactions), (ii) specified changes in the\nmajority of the Board of Directors of U.S.\nBancorp (not including the election of\ndirectors whose election or nomination was\napproved by a majority of the then incumbent\nBoard of Directors), (iii) consummation of a\nreorganization, merger or consolidation or\nsale or other disposition of all or\nsubstantially all of the assets of U.S.\nBancorp, unless certain conditions are met\nwith respect to the ownership and composition\nof the Board of Directors of the entity\nresulting from such transaction, or (iv)\nconsummation of a complete liquidation or\ndissolution of the company. Other Change in\nControl Provisions In the event of a change in\ncontrol, the Committee or the Board of\nDirectors may provide for any one of the\nfollowing to occur upon the event giving rise\nto the change in control: \u25b6 Termination of any\naward, whether or not vested, in exchange for\nan amount of cash and/or other property equal\nto the amount that would have been received\nupon exercise of the award or realization of\nthe participant\u2019s rights under the award.\nAwards may be terminated without payment if\nthe Committee or Board of Directors determines\nthat no amount would be realizable under the\naward as of the time of the change in control;\n\u25b6 Replacement of any award with other rights\nor property selected by the Committee or the\nBoard of Directors; \u25b6 Assumption of any award\nby the successor entity (or its parent or\nsubsidiary) or the arrangement for the\nsubstitution of similar awards covering the\nstock of such successor entity, subject to\nadjustment as necessary to the number and\nkinds of shares and prices; \u25b6 An award may\nbecome exercisable or payable or fully vested\nwith respect to all shares subject to the\naward, notwithstanding anything to the\ncontrary in the applicable award agreement; or\n\u25b6 Require that the award cannot vest, be\nexercised or become payable until after a\nfuture date, which may be the effective date\nof the change in control. None of the above\nactions will be deemed to impair or otherwise\nadversely alter rights of any holder of an\naward. Duration, Termination and Amendment The\n2024 Plan will become effective on the date it\nis approved by our shareholders. Awards may be\ngranted under the 2024 Plan only during a\n10-year period following the date of\nshareholder approval, unless the 2024 Plan is\nterminated earlier in accordance with its\nterms. However, unless otherwise expressly\nprovided in the 2024 Plan or in an applicable\naward agreement, any award already granted may\nextend beyond the termination of the 2024\nPlan, and the authority of the Committee with\nrespect to the 2024 Plan and any awards, and\nthe authority of the Board of Directors to\namend the 2024 Plan, will extend beyond the\ntermination of the 2024 Plan. The Board of\nDirectors may amend, alter, suspend,\ndiscontinue or terminate the 2024 Plan at any\ntime. However, any amendment to the 2024 Plan\nis subject to compliance with all applicable\nlaws, rules, regulations and policies of any\ngovernment entity or securities exchange. In\naddition, approval of our shareholders is\nrequired for any amendment to the 2024 Plan\nthat would:\n                                              \n    92      U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 4 \u2014 Approval of the\nU.S. Bancorp 2024 Stock Incentive Plan \u25b6\nRequire shareholder approval under rules or\nregulations of the SEC, the NYSE or any other\nsecurities exchange that are applicable to\nU.S. Bancorp; \u25b6 Increase the number of shares\nauthorized for issuance under the 2024 Plan; \u25b6\nPermit repricing of options or stock\nappreciation rights; \u25b6 Permit the award of\noptions or stock appreciation rights at a\nprice less than 100% of the fair market value\nof a share on the date of grant of such\noptions or stock appreciation rights; or \u25b6\nIncrease the maximum 10-year term for options\nand stock appreciation rights. Federal Income\nTax Consequences Grant of Options and Stock\nAppreciation Rights The grant of a non-\nqualified stock option or stock appreciation\nright is not expected to result in any taxable\nincome for the participant. Exercise of\nOptions and Stock Appreciation Rights Upon\nexercising a non-qualified stock option, the\nparticipant must recognize ordinary income\nequal to the excess of the fair market value\nof the shares of our common stock acquired on\nthe date of exercise over the exercise price,\nand we will generally be entitled at that time\nto an income tax deduction for the same\namount. Upon the exercise of a stock\nappreciation right, the amount of any cash\nreceived by the participant and the fair\nmarket value on the exercise date of any\nshares of our common stock received are\ntaxable to the recipient as ordinary income\nand generally deductible by us. Disposition of\nShares Acquired Upon Exercise of Options and\nStock Appreciation Rights The tax consequence\nupon a disposition of shares acquired through\nthe exercise of a non-qualified stock option\nor stock appreciation right will depend on how\nlong the shares have been held. Generally,\nthere will be no tax consequence to us in\nconnection with the disposition of shares\nacquired under an option or stock appreciation\nright. Awards Other than Options and Stock\nAppreciation Rights As to other awards granted\nunder the 2024 Plan that are payable either in\ncash or shares of our common stock that are\neither transferable or not subject to\nsubstantial risk of forfeiture, the holder of\nthe award must recognize ordinary income equal\nto (a) the amount of cash received or, as\napplicable, (b) the excess of (i) the fair\nmarket value of the shares received\n(determined as of the date of receipt) over\n(ii) the amount (if any) paid for the shares\nby the holder of the award. We will generally\nbe entitled at that time to an income tax\ndeduction for the same amount. As to an award\nthat is payable in shares of our common stock\nthat are restricted from transfer and subject\nto substantial risk of forfeiture, unless a\nspecial election is made by the holder of the\naward under the Code, the holder must\nrecognize ordinary income equal to the excess\nof (i) the fair market value of the shares\nreceived (determined as of the first time the\nshares become transferable or not subject to\nsubstantial risk of forfeiture, whichever\noccurs earlier) over (ii) the amount (if any)\npaid for the shares by the holder of the\naward. We will generally be entitled at that\ntime to an income tax deduction for the same\namount. Income Tax Deduction Section 162(m) of\nthe Code generally disallows a tax deduction\nto a publicly-held company for compensation in\nexcess of $1 million paid to its \u201ccovered\nemployees\u201d which generally includes all NEOs.\nThe Committee considers the tax deductibility\nof each element of executive compensation as a\nfactor in our overall compensation program,\nand subject to the usual rules concerning\nreasonable compensation, including our\nobligation to withhold or otherwise collect\ncertain income and payroll taxes, we will\ngenerally be entitled to a corresponding\nincome tax deduction at the time a participant\nrecognizes ordinary income from awards made\nunder the 2024 Plan. Impact of Section 409A\nSection 409A of the Code applies to deferred\ncompensation, which is generally defined as\ncompensation earned currently, the payment of\nwhich is deferred to a later taxable year.\nAwards under the 2024 Plan are intended to be\nexempt from the requirements of Section 409A\nor to satisfy its requirements. An award that\nis subject to Section 409A and fails to\nsatisfy its requirements will subject the\nholder of the award to immediate taxation,\ninterest and an additional 20% tax on the\nvested amount underlying the award.\nApplication of Section 16 Special rules may\napply to individuals subject to Section 16 of\nthe Exchange Act.

We         \n      encourage you to vote by Internet.      \n      \u25b6                                       \n      If you are a shareholder who            \n      received an email directing you to      \n      the proxy materials or a notice by      \n      mail regarding the Internet             \n      availability of the proxy               \n      materials:You may access the proxy      \n      materials and voting instructions       \n      over the Internet via the web           \n      address provided in the e-mail or       \n      notice. In order to access this         \n      material and vote, you will need        \n      the 16-digit control number             \n      provided in the e-mail or on the        \n      notice.

If you      \n      vote by mail, please complete,          \n      sign and date the proxy card or         \n      voting instruction form and mail        \n      it in the accompanying                  \n      pre-addressed envelope.                 \n      \u200b                                        \n                                              \nHow do I vote if my shares are held in the\nU.S. Bank 401(k) Savings Plan? If you hold any\nshares in the U.S. Bank 401(k) Savings Plan,\nyou are receiving, or being provided access\nto, the same proxy materials as any other\nshareholder. However, your proxy vote will\nserve as voting instructions to the plan\ntrustee. Your voting instructions must be\nreceived at least five days prior to the\nannual meeting in order to count. In\naccordance with the terms of the plan, the\ntrustee will vote all of the shares held in\nthe plan in the same proportion as the actual\nproxy votes submitted by plan participants at\nleast five days prior to the annual meeting.\nWhy did I receive a notice regarding the\nInternet availability of proxy materials\ninstead of a printed copy of the proxy\nmaterials? In accordance with rules adopted by\nthe SEC, we are furnishing our proxy materials\nto our shareholders primarily over the\nInternet instead of mailing printed copies of\nthose materials to each shareholder. By doing\nso, we reduce costs and lessen the\nenvironmental impact of our proxy\nsolicitation. On or about March 5, 2024, we\nmailed a notice of Internet availability of\nthe proxy materials to most of our\nshareholders. The notice contains instructions\nabout how to access our proxy materials and\nvote online. This notice is not a proxy card\nand cannot be used to vote your shares. If you\nreceived a notice but would like to receive a\npaper copy of our proxy materials, please\nfollow the instructions on the notice. Our\nother shareholders, including shareholders who\nhave previously requested to receive paper\ncopies of the proxy materials and persons\nholding shares through our benefit plans,\nreceived paper copies of the proxy materials\ninstead of a notice. If you received paper\ncopies of the notice or proxy materials, we\nencourage you to sign up to receive all of\nyour future proxy materials electronically, as\ndescribed under \u201cHow can I receive my proxy\nmaterials by e-mail in the future?\u201d below.\n                                              \n    98      U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Questions and answers about\nthe annual meeting and voting Who is entitled\nto vote at the meeting? The Board has set\nFebruary 20, 2024, as the record date for the\nannual meeting. If you were a shareholder at\nthe close of business on February 20, 2024,\nyou are entitled to vote at the meeting. As of\nthe record date, 1,558,311,850 shares of our\ncommon stock were issued and outstanding and,\ntherefore, eligible to vote at the meeting.\nWhat are my voting rights? Holders of our\ncommon stock are entitled to one vote per\nshare. Therefore, a total of 1,558,311,850\nvotes are entitled to be cast at the meeting.\nThere is no cumulative voting. How many shares\nmust be present to hold the meeting? In\naccordance with our bylaws, shares equal to at\nleast one-third of the voting power of our\noutstanding shares of common stock as of the\nrecord date must be present at the meeting in\norder to hold the meeting and conduct\nbusiness. This is called a quorum. Your shares\nare counted as present at the meeting if: \u25b6\nyou have properly submitted a proxy vote by\nInternet, telephone or mail, even if you\nabstain from voting on one or more matters; or\n\u25b6 you hold your shares in street name (as\ndiscussed below) and you provide voting\ninstructions to your broker, bank, trust\ncompany or other nominee or you do not provide\nvoting instructions but your broker, bank,\ntrust company or other nominee uses its\ndiscretionary authority to vote your shares on\nthe ratification of the selection of our\nindependent auditor. What is the difference\nbetween a shareholder of record and a \u201cstreet\nname\u201d holder? If your shares are registered\ndirectly in your name with our transfer agent,\nComputershare Investor Services, you are\nconsidered the shareholder of record with\nrespect to those shares. If your shares are\nheld in a stock brokerage account or by a\nbank, trust company or other nominee, then the\nbroker, bank, trust company or other nominee\nis considered to be the shareholder of record\nwith respect to those shares. However, you\nstill are considered the beneficial owner of\nthose shares, and your shares are said to be\nheld in \u201cstreet name.\u201d Street name holders\ngenerally cannot vote their shares directly\nand must instead instruct the broker, bank,\ntrust company or other nominee how to vote\ntheir shares using the voting instruction form\nprovided by it. How do I attend the virtual\nmeeting? We are holding the 2024 Annual\nMeeting of Shareholders in a virtual-only\nformat. You will not be able to attend the\nannual meeting at a physical location.

In         \n      order to allow all shareholders         \n      the ability to ask questions, we        \n      may limit each shareholder to two       \n      questions, whether submitted prior      \n      to or during the meeting.               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      Shareholders must also enter the        \n      meeting using their 16-digit            \n      control number in order to vote.        \n      Even if you currently plan to           \n      attend the virtual meeting, we          \n      recommend that you submit your          \n      proxy as described above so that        \n      your vote will be counted if you        \n      later decide not to attend the          \n      meeting. If you are a participant       \n      in the U.S. Bank 401(k) Savings         \n      Plan or hold your shares in street      \n      name, you may submit your vote as       \n      described above, but you may not        \n      vote your U.S. Bank 401(k) Savings      \n      Plan shares or shares held in           \n      street name during the meeting.         \n                                              \nWhat if I am a shareholder of record and do\nnot specify how I want my shares voted? If you\nsubmit your proxy by Internet or submit a\nsigned proxy card and do not specify how you\nwant to vote your shares, we will vote your\nshares in accordance with the recommendations\nof the Board. Our telephone voting procedures\ndo not permit you to submit your proxy vote by\ntelephone without specifying how you want your\nshares voted. What if I hold my shares in\nstreet name and do not provide voting\ninstructions? If you hold your shares in\nstreet name and do not provide voting\ninstructions, your broker, bank, trust company\nor other nominee has discretionary authority\nto vote your shares on the ratification of the\nselection of EY as our independent auditor.\nHowever, in the absence of your specific\ninstructions as to how to vote, your broker,\nbank, trust company or other nominee does not\nhave discretionary authority to vote on any\nother proposal. Such a situation results in a\n\u201cbroker non-vote,\u201d which does not have an\neffect on the outcome of the proposal. It is\nimportant, therefore, that you provide\ninstructions to your broker, bank, trust\ncompany or other nominee so that your vote\nwith respect to the other proposals is\ncounted. What is the voting standard and what\nis the effect of abstentions? You may vote\n\u201cFOR,\u201d \u201cAGAINST\u201d or \u201cABSTAIN\u201d with respect to\nthe election of each nominee for the Board of\nDirectors (Proposal 1), the advisory vote on\nexecutive compensation (Proposal 2), the\nratification of the selection of independent\nauditor (Proposal 3) and the approval of the\nU.S. Bancorp 2024 Stock Incentive Plan\n(Proposal 4).

If you receive more than one notice\nof Internet availability of proxy materials,\nproxy card, voting instruction form, or e-mail\nwith instructions on how to access the proxy\nmaterials, it means that you hold shares in\nmore than one account. To ensure that all of\nyour shares are voted, vote separately for\neach notice of Internet availability of proxy\nmaterials, proxy card, voting instruction\nform, and e-mail you receive. Can I change my\nvote after submitting my proxy? Yes. You may\nrevoke your proxy and change your vote at any\ntime before your proxy is voted at the annual\nmeeting. If you are a shareholder of record,\nyou may revoke your proxy and change your vote\nby: \u25b6 voting again over the Internet or by\ntelephone by no later than 11:59 p.m., eastern\ntime, on April 15, 2024, or by submitting a\nproxy card with a later date and returning it\nso that it is received by April 15, 2024; \u25b6\nvoting again during the meeting; or \u25b6\nsubmitting written notice of revocation to our\nCorporate Secretary at the address shown on\npage 103 so that it is received by April 15,\n2024. To request an additional proxy card, or\nif you have any questions about the annual\nmeeting or how to vote or revoke your proxy,\nyou should write to Investor Relations, U.S.\nBancorp, 800 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, MN\n55402 or call 866.775.9668. If you hold your\nshares in street name, contact your broker,\nbank, trust company or other nominee regarding\nhow to revoke your proxy and change your vote.\nIf you are a participant in the U.S. Bank\n401(k) Savings Plan, you may revoke your proxy\nand change your vote as described above, but\nonly until 11:59 p.m., eastern time, on April\n11, 2024. Will my vote be kept confidential?\nYes. We have procedures to ensure that all\nproxies, ballots and voting tabulations that\nidentify shareholders are kept permanently\nconfidential, except as follows: to meet legal\nrequirements, to assert claims for or defend\nclaims against our company, to allow\nauthorized individuals to count and certify\nthe results of the shareholder vote if a proxy\nsolicitation in opposition to the Board takes\nplace, or to respond to shareholders who have\nwritten comments on proxy cards or who have\nrequested disclosure. We also have the voting\ntabulations performed by an independent third\nparty. Who will count the votes?\nRepresentatives of Broadridge Financial\nSolutions, Inc., our tabulation agent, will\ntabulate the votes and act as independent\ninspectors of election. Where can I find the\nvoting results? We expect to announce the\npreliminary voting results for each proposal\nat our 2024 annual meeting of shareholders.\nThe final voting results will be reported in a\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K that will be filed\nwith the SEC and made available on our\nwebsite. Who pays for the cost of proxy\npreparation and solicitation? We pay for the\ncost of proxy preparation and solicitation,\nincluding the reasonable charges and expenses\nof brokerage firms, banks, trust companies or\nother nominees for forwarding proxy materials\nto street name holders. We have retained\nAlliance Advisors, LLC, to assist in the\nsolicitation of proxies for the annual meeting\nfor a fee of $26,000, plus associated costs\nand expenses. We are soliciting proxies\nprimarily by mail. In addition, our directors,\nofficers and employees may solicit proxies by\ntelephone, facsimile, e-mail or in person.\nThey will not receive any additional\ncompensation for these activities. Do we\n\u201chousehold\u201d annual meeting materials? The SEC\nrules allow a single copy of the notice of\nInternet availability of proxy materials or\nproxy statement and annual report to be\ndelivered to multiple shareholders sharing the\nsame address and last name, or who we\nreasonably believe are members of the same\nfamily, and who consent to receive a single\ncopy of these materials in a manner provided\nby these rules. This practice is referred to\nas \u201chouseholding.\u201d Although we do not\nhousehold for our registered shareholders, we\nunderstand that some brokers, banks, trust\ncompanies and other nominees household U.S.\nBancorp notices of Internet availability of\nproxy materials or proxy statements and annual\nreports, delivering a single copy of each to\nmultiple shareholders sharing an address\nunless contrary instructions have been\nreceived from the affected shareholders. Once\nyou have received notice from your broker,\nbank, trust company or other nominee that it\nwill be householding materials to your\naddress, householding will continue until you\nare notified otherwise or until you revoke\nyour consent.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2024 Proxy            101    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Questions and answers about\nthe annual meeting and voting\n\nIf, at any time, you no longer wish to\nparticipate in householding and would prefer\nto receive a separate copy of our notice of\nInternet availability of proxy materials or\nproxy statement or annual report, or if you\nare receiving multiple copies of any of these\ndocuments and wish to receive only one, please\nnotify your broker, bank, trust company or\nother nominee. We will deliver promptly upon\nwritten or oral request a separate copy of our\nnotice of Internet availability of proxy\nmaterials, proxy statement and/or our annual\nreport to a shareholder at a shared address to\nwhich a single copy was delivered. For copies\nof any of these documents, shareholders should\nwrite to Investor Relations, U.S. Bancorp, BC-\nMN-H23K, 800 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis,\nMinnesota 55402, or call 866.775.9668. How can\nI receive my proxy materials by e-mail in the\nfuture? Instead of receiving future paper\ncopies of the notice of Internet availability\nof proxy materials or our proxy materials by\nmail, you can elect to receive an e-mail with\nlinks to these documents, your control number\nand instructions for voting over the Internet.\nOpting to receive your proxy materials by\ne-mail will save the cost of producing and\nmailing documents to you and will also help\nconserve environmental resources. Your e-mail\naddress will be kept separate from any other\ncompany operations and will be used for no\nother purpose. If we mailed you a notice of\nInternet availability of proxy materials or a\nprinted copy of our proxy statement and annual\nreport and you would like to sign up to\nreceive these materials by e-mail in the\nfuture, you can choose this option by: \u25b6\nfollowing the instructions provided on your\nproxy card or voting instruction form if you\nreceived a paper copy of the proxy materials;\n\u25b6 following the instructions provided when you\nvote over the Internet; or \u25b6 going to\nhttp://enroll.icsdelivery.com/usb and\nfollowing the instructions provided.

Delinquent Section 16(a) reports\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our\nexecutive officers, Controller and directors\nto file initial reports of ownership and\nreports of changes in ownership of our\nsecurities with the SEC. Our executive\nofficers, Controller and directors also are\nrequired to furnish us with copies of these\nreports. Based solely on a review of the\nSection 16(a) reports furnished to us with\nrespect to 2023 and written representations\nfrom our executive officers, Controller and\ndirectors, we believe that all Section 16(a)\nfiling requirements applicable to those\npersons during 2023 were satisfied, except\nthat James B. Kelligrew was late in reporting\ncertain transactions that were conducted by\nthird-party investment advisers in their sole\ndiscretion and without the direction or\nknowledge of Mr. Kelligrew or his spouse. Such\ntransactions took place between 2016 and 2023,\nand Mr. Kelligrew failed to file a Form 5 in\neach of the years 2017 through 2023 with\nrespect to any such transactions that had not\npreviously been reported on Form 4 during the\napplicable year. Promptly after discovering\nthe transactions, Mr. Kelligrew filed four\nForm 4s on October 20, 2023 to report all 117\ntransactions that had not been reported\npreviously. Additionally, Timothy A. Welsh was\nlate in filing one Form 4. Mr. Welsh\u2019s\ntransaction was executed in March 2023 and\nreported late in March 2023.

The Company\u2019s major\nlines of business are Consumer and Business\nBanking, Payment Services, Wealth, Corporate,\nCommercial and Institutional Banking, and\nTreasury and Corporate Support. We provide the\npercentage of revenue attributable to each\nbusiness line, excluding Treasury and\nCorporate Support, as it reflects our\ncompany\u2019s diversified mix of businesses. We\ndisclose the return on tangible common equity\nas we believe it is a useful financial measure\nto assess the company\u2019s use of equity. In\naddition, we have included the other financial\nmeasures listed above on an adjusted basis to\nexclude notable items related to the merger\nand integration charges, balance sheet\nrepositioning and capital management actions,\nan FDIC special assessment, a foundation\ncontribution and a favorable discrete tax\nsettlement, in order to provide a greater\nunderstanding of ongoing operations and better\ncomparability with prior year results. We use\nnet interest income on a taxable-equivalent\nbasis to calculate our efficiency ratio\nbecause we believe that this presentation is\nthe preferred industry measurement of net\ninterest income as it provides a relevant\ncomparison of net interest income arising from\ntaxable and tax-exempt sources.

In the\nevent that any extraordinary dividend or other\ndistribution (whether in the form of cash,\nShares, other securities or other property),\nstock split or a combination or consolidation\nof the outstanding Shares into a lesser number\nof shares, is declared with respect to the\nShares, the authorization limits under\nSections 4(a) and 4(d) shall be increased or\ndecreased proportionately, and the Shares then\nsubject to each Award shall be increased or\ndecreased proportionately without any change\nin the aggregate purchase price therefor. In\nthe event the Shares shall be changed into or\nexchanged for a different number or class of\nshares of stock or securities of the Company\nor of another corporation, whether through\nrecapitalization, reorganization,\nreclassification, merger, consolidation,\nsplit-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or\nexchange of Shares or other securities of the\nCompany, issuance of warrants or other rights\nto purchase Shares or other securities of the\nCompany, or any other similar corporate\ntransaction or event affects the Shares such\nthat an equitable adjustment would be required\nin order to prevent dilution or enlargement of\nthe benefits or potential benefits intended to\nbe made available under the Plan, then the\nauthorization limits under Sections 4(a) and\n4(d) shall be adjusted proportionately, and an\nequitable adjustment shall be made to each\nShare subject to an Award such that no\ndilution or enlargement of the benefits or\npotential benefits occurs. Each such Share\nthen subject to each Award shall be adjusted\nto the number and class of shares into which\neach outstanding Share shall be so exchanged\nsuch that no dilution or enlargement of the\nbenefits occurs, all without change in the\naggregate purchase price for the Shares then\nsubject to each Award. Action by the Committee\npursuant to this Section 4(c) may include\nadjustment to any or all of: (i) the number\nand type of Shares (or other securities or\nother property) that thereafter may be made\nthe subject of Awards or be delivered under\nthe Plan; (ii) the number and type of Shares\n(or other securities or other property)\nsubject to outstanding Awards; (iii) the\npurchase price or exercise price of a Share\nunder any outstanding Award or the measure to\nbe used to determine the amount of the benefit\npayable on an Award; and (iv) any other\nadjustments the Committee determines to be\nequitable.

Except with respect to\nRestricted Stock, Stock Awards and certain\ntypes of stock-based Performance Awards,\nneither a Participant nor the Participant\u2019s\nlegal representative shall be, or have any of\nthe rights and privileges of, a stockholder of\nthe Company with respect to any Shares\nissuable upon the exercise or payment of any\nAward, in whole or in part, unless and until\nthe Shares have been issued. (e) No Limit on\nOther Compensation Plans or Arrangements.\nNothing contained in the Plan shall prevent\nthe Company or any Affiliate from adopting or\ncontinuing in effect other or additional\ncompensation plans or arrangements, and such\nplans or arrangements may be either generally\napplicable or applicable only in specific\ncases. (f) No Right to Employment or\nDirectorship. The grant of an Award shall not\nbe construed as giving a Participant the right\nto be retained as an employee of the Company\nor any Affiliate, or a Director to be retained\nas a Director, nor will it affect in any way\nthe right of the Company or an Affiliate to\nterminate a Participant\u2019s employment at any\ntime, with or without cause, or remove a\nDirector in accordance with applicable law. In\naddition, the Company or an Affiliate may at\nany time dismiss a Participant from employment\nor remove a Director who is a Participant free\nfrom any liability or any claim under the Plan\nor any Award, unless otherwise expressly\nprovided in the Plan or in any Award\nAgreement. Nothing in this Plan shall confer\non any person any legal or equitable right\nagainst the Company or any Affiliate, directly\nor indirectly, or give rise to any cause of\naction at law or in equity against the Company\nor an Affiliate. Under no circumstances shall\nany person ceasing to be an employee of the\nCompany or any Affiliate be entitled to any\ncompensation for any loss of any right or\nbenefit under the Plan which such employee\nmight otherwise have enjoyed but for\ntermination of employment, whether such\ncompensation is claimed by way of damages for\nwrongful or unfair dismissal, breach of\ncontract or otherwise.

The\ninternal law, and not the law of conflicts, of\nthe State of Delaware, shall govern all\nquestions concerning the validity,\nconstruction and effect of the Plan or any\nAward, and any rules and regulations relating\nto the Plan or any Award. (h) Severability. If\nany provision of the Plan or any Award is or\nbecomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or\nunenforceable in any jurisdiction or would\ndisqualify the Plan or any Award under any law\ndeemed applicable by the Committee, such\nprovision shall be construed or deemed amended\nto conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot\nbe so construed or deemed amended without, in\nthe determination of the Committee, materially\naltering the purpose or intent of the Plan or\nthe Award, such provision shall be stricken as\nto such jurisdiction or Award, and the\nremainder of the Plan or any such Award shall\nremain in full force and effect. (i) No Trust\nor Fund Created. Neither the Plan nor any\nAward shall create or be construed to create a\ntrust or separate fund of any kind or a\nfiduciary relationship between the Company or\nany Affiliate and a Participant or any other\nPerson. To the extent that any Person acquires\na right to receive payments from the Company\nor any Affiliate pursuant to an Award, such\nright shall be no greater than the right of\nany unsecured general creditor of the Company\nor any Affiliate.
