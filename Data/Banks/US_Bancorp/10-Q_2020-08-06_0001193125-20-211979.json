This\nquarterly report on Form 10-Qcontains forward-\nlooking statements about U.S. Bancorp.        \nStatements that are not historical or current \nfacts, including statements about beliefs and \nexpectations, are forward-looking statements  \nand are based on the information available to,\nand assumptions and estimates made by,        \nmanagement as of the date hereof. These       \nforward-looking statements cover, among other \nthings, anticipated future revenue and        \nexpenses and the future plans and prospects of\nU.S. Bancorp. Forward-looking statements      \ninvolve inherent risks and uncertainties, and \nimportant factors could cause actual results  \nto differ materially from those anticipated.  \nThe COVID-19pandemic is adversely affecting   \nU.S. Bancorp, its customers, counterparties,  \nemployees, and third-party service providers, \nand the ultimate extent of the impacts on its \nbusiness, financial position, results of      \noperations, liquidity, and prospects is       \nuncertain. Continued deterioration in general \nbusiness and economic conditions or turbulence\nin domestic or global financial markets could \nadversely affect U.S. Bancorp\u2019s revenues and  \nthe values of its assets and liabilities,     \nreduce the availability of funding to certain \nfinancial institutions, lead to a tightening  \nof credit, and increase stock price           \nvolatility. In addition, changes to statutes, \nregulations, or regulatory policies or        \npractices could affect U.S. Bancorp in        \nsubstantial and unpredictable ways. U.S.      \nBancorp\u2019s results could also be adversely     \naffected by changes in interest rates; further\nincreases in unemployment rates; deterioration\nin the credit quality of its loan portfolios  \nor in the value of the collateral securing    \nthose loans; deterioration in the value of its\ninvestment securities; legal and regulatory   \ndevelopments; litigation; increased           \ncompetition from both banks and non-          \nbanks;changes in the level of tariffs and     \nother trade policies of the United States and \nits global trading partners; changes in       \ncustomer behavior and preferences; breaches in\ndata security; failures to safeguard personal \ninformation; effects of mergers and           \nacquisitions and related integration; effects \nof critical accounting policies and judgments;\nand management\u2019s ability to effectively manage\ncredit risk, market risk, operational risk,   \ncompliance risk, strategic risk, interest rate\nrisk, liquidity risk and reputation risk. For \ndiscussion of these and other risks that may  \ncause actual results to differ from           \nexpectations, refer to the other information  \nin this report, including the section entitled\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d and U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Annual      \nReport on Form 10-Kfor the year ended December\n31, 2019, on file with the Securities and     \nExchange Commission, including the sections   \nentitled \u201cCorporate Risk Profile\u201d and \u201cRisk   \nFactors\u201d contained in Exhibit 13, and all     \nsubsequent filings with the Securities and    \nExchange Commission under Sections 13(a),     \n13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange \nAct of 1934. In addition, factors other than  \nthese risks also could adversely affect U.S.  \nBancorp\u2019s results, and the reader should not  \nconsider these risks to be a complete set of  \nall potential risks or uncertainties.

         \nsubsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) reported net     \nincome attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $689   \nmillion for the second quarter of 2020, or    \n$0.41 per diluted common share, compared with \n$1.8 billion, or $1.09 per diluted common     \nshare, for the second quarter of 2019. Return \non average assets and return on average common\nequity were 0.51 percent and 5.3 percent,     \nrespectively, for the second quarter of 2020, \ncompared with 1.55 percent and 15.0 percent,  \nrespectively, for the second quarter of 2019. \nDuring a challenging period adversely impacted\nby the COVID-19pandemic, the Company\u2019s        \ndiversified business mix generated growth in  \nnet revenue and supported a provision for     \ncredit losses of $1.7 billion resulting in a  \n$1.3 billion increase in the allowance for    \ncredit losses in the second quarter of 2020.  \nTotal net revenue for the second quarter of   \n2020 was $16 million (0.3 percent) higher than\nthe second quarter of 2019, reflecting a 5.0  \npercent increase in noninterest income,       \npartially offset by a 3.2 percent decrease in \nnet interest income. The decrease in net      \ninterest income from the second quarter of    \n2019 was primarily due to the impact of       \ndeclining interest rates, partially offset by \nchanges in deposit and funding mix, and loan  \ngrowth. The noninterest income increase was   \ndriven by significant growth in mortgage      \nbanking revenue due to refinancing activities,\nstrong growth in commercial products revenue, \nand an increase in gains on the sale of       \ninvestment securities. Growth in these fee    \ncategories was partially offset by a decline  \nin payment services revenue and deposit       \nservice charges related to lower consumer and \ncommercial spending as well as higher fee     \nwaivers related to customers impacted by      \nCOVID-19.Additionally, other noninterest      \nincome declined from the second quarter of    \n2019 due to lower equity investment income,   \nlower tax credit syndication revenues, and    \nasset impairments as a result of property     \ndamage from civil unrest occurring during the \nsecond quarter of 2020. Noninterest expense in\nthe second quarter of 2020 was $165 million   \n(5.2 percent) higher than the second quarter  \nof 2019, reflecting costs related to          \nCOVID-19and an increase in revenue-related    \nproduction expenses in the second quarter of  \n2020. Additionally, noninterest expense       \nreflected an increase in personnel and        \ntechnology and communications expenses related\nto developing digital capabilities and related\nbusiness investment, partially offset by lower\nmarketing and business development expense.   \nThe provision for credit losses for the second\nquarter of 2020 of $1.7 billion was $1.4      \nbillion higher than the second quarter of     \n2019, reflecting an increase in the allowance \nfor credit losses during the second quarter of\n2020 due to deteriorating economic conditions \ndriven by the impact of COVID-19on the        \ndomestic and global economies. Net charge-offs\nin the second quarter of 2020 were $437       \nmillion, compared with $350 million in the    \nsecond quarter of 2019. Refer to \u201cCorporate   \nRisk Profile\u201d for further information on the  \nprovision for credit losses, net charge-offs, \nnonperforming assets and other factors        \nconsidered by the Company in assessing the    \ncredit quality of the loan portfolio and      \nestablishing the allowance for credit losses. \nNet income attributable to U.S. Bancorp for   \nthe first six months of 2020 was $1.9 billion,\nor $1.12 per diluted common share, compared   \nwith $3.5 billion, or $2.10 per diluted common\nshare, for the first six months of 2019.      \nReturn on average assets and return on average\ncommon equity were 0.72 percent and 7.5       \npercent, respectively, for the first six      \nmonths of 2020, compared with 1.52 percent and\n14.7 percent, respectively, for the first six \nmonths of 2019. Total net revenue for the     \nfirst six months of 2020 was $211 million (1.9\npercent) higher than the first six months of  \n2019, reflecting a 7.5 percent increase in    \nnoninterest income, partially offset by a 2.1 \npercent decrease in net interest income (2.2  \npercent on a taxable-equivalent basis). The   \ndecrease in net interest income from the first\nsix months of 2019 was primarily due to the   \nimpact of declining interest rates, partially \noffset by changes in deposit and funding mix, \nand loan growth. The noninterest income       \nincrease was driven by significant growth in  \nmortgage banking revenue due to refinancing   \nactivities, strong growth in commercial       \nproducts revenue and trust and investment     \nmanagement fees, and an increase in gains on  \nthe sale of investment securities. Growth in  \nthese fee categories was partially offset by a\ndecline in payment services revenue and       \ndeposit service charges related to lower      \nconsumer and commercial spending as well as   \nhigher fee waivers related to customers       \nimpacted by COVID-19.Additionally, other      \nnoninterest income declined from the prior    \nyear due to lower equity investment income,   \nlower tax credit syndication revenues, and    \nasset impairments recorded in                 \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    3  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nthe first six months of 2020, partially offset\nby gains on sale of certain businesses in the \nfirst six months of 2020. Noninterest expense \nin the first six months of 2020 was $394      \nmillion (6.3 percent) higher than the first   \nsix months of 2019, reflecting costs related  \nto COVID-19and an increase in revenue-related \nproduction expenses in the first six months of\n2020. Additionally, noninterest expense       \nreflected an increase in personnel and        \ntechnology and communications expenses related\nto developing digital capabilities and related\nbusiness investment, partially offset by lower\nmarketing and business development expense.   \nThe provision for credit losses for the first \nsix months of 2020 of $2.7 billion was $2.0   \nbillion higher than the first six months of   \n2019, reflecting an increase in the allowance \nfor credit losses during the first six months \nof 2020 due to deteriorating economic         \nconditions driven by the impact of COVID-19on \nthe domestic and global economies. Net charge-\noffs in the first six months of 2020 were $830\nmillion, compared with $717 million in the    \nfirst six months of 2019.

The decreases were      \nprincipally driven by the impact of declining \ninterest rates, partially offset by changes in\ndeposit and funding mix, and loan growth.     \nAverage earning assets were $67.2 billion     \n(15.7 percent) higher in the second quarter   \nand $47.7 billion (11.3 percent) higher in the\nfirst six months of 2020, compared with the   \nsame periods of 2019, reflecting increases in \nloans, investment securities and other earning\nassets. The net interest margin, on a taxable-\nequivalent basis, in the second quarter and   \nfirst six months of 2020 was 2.62 percent and \n2.76 percent, respectively, compared with 3.13\npercent and 3.14 percent in the second quarter\nand first six months of 2019, respectively.   \nThe decrease in net interest margin from the  \nprior year was primarily due to the impact of \nthe lower yield curve and a decision to retain\nhigher cash balances to maintain liquidity    \ngiven the environment, partially offset by    \nchanges in deposit pricing and funding mix.   \nThe Company expects its net interest margin to\nbe relatively stable in the third quarter of  \n2020, as compared with the second quarter of  \n2020. Refer to the \u201cConsolidated Daily Average\nBalance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates\u201d   \ntables for further information on net interest\nincome. Average total loans in the second     \nquarter and first six months of 2020 were     \n$28.9 billion (10.0 percent) and $20.2 billion\n(7.0 percent) higher, respectively, than the  \nsame periods of 2019. The increases were      \nprimarily due to higher commercial loans,     \nreflecting the utilization of bank credit     \nfacilities by customers to support liquidity  \nrequirements as well as the impact of loans   \nmade under the Small Business Administration\u2019s\n(\u201cSBA\u201d) Paycheck Protection Program, along    \nwith growth in residential mortgages given the\nlower interest rate environment. These        \nincreases were partially offset by lower      \ncredit card loans reflecting lower consumer   \nspending during the first six months of 2020, \nas well as lower other retail loans. Average  \ninvestment securities in the second quarter   \nand first six months of 2020 were $5.4 billion\n(4.7 percent) and $6.0 billion (5.3 percent)  \nhigher, respectively, than the same periods of\n2019, primarily due to purchases of mortgage- \nbacked securities, net of prepayments and     \nmaturities, partially offset by U.S. Treasury \nsecurities sales and maturities, net of       \npurchases. Average total deposits for the     \nsecond quarter and first six months of 2020   \nwere $58.1 billion (16.8 percent) and $42.7   \nbillion (12.6 percent) higher, respectively,  \nthan the same periods of 2019. Average total  \nsavings deposits for the second quarter and   \nfirst six months of 2020 were $39.7 billion   \n(17.6 percent) and $35.1 billion (15.9        \npercent) higher, respectively, than the same  \nperiods of the prior year, driven by increases\nin Corporate and Commercial Banking, Consumer \nand Business Banking, and Wealth Management   \nand Investment Services balances. Average     \nnoninterest-bearing deposits for the second   \nquarter and first six months of 2020 were     \n$22.0 billion (30.1 percent) and $11.4 billion\n(15.5 percent) higher, respectively, than the \nsame periods of 2019, primarily due to        \nincreases in Corporate and Commercial Banking,\nConsumer and Business Banking, and Wealth     \nManagement and Investment Services balances.  \nThe growth in average total savings and       \nnoninterest-bearing deposits was primarily a  \nresult of the actions by the federal          \ngovernment to increase liquidity in the       \nfinancial system, customers maintaining       \nbalance sheet liquidity by utilizing existing \ncredit facilities and government stimulus     \nprograms. Average time deposits for the second\nquarter and first six months of 2020 were $3.6\nbillion (7.7 percent) and $3.7 billion (8.0   \npercent) lower, respectively, than the same   \nperiods of the prior year, primarily driven by\ndecreases in those deposits managed as an     \nalternative to other funding sources, based   \nlargely on relative pricing and liquidity     \ncharacteristics, partially offset by increases\nin Consumer and Business Banking balances.    \n                     \n  4    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                 \n  Table\u00a02    Noninterest Income  \n                                 \n                                              \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n             $      \u2026      $      $      \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    *                    *    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    *                    *    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n             $      \u2026      $      $      \u2026    \n                                              \n                      \n  *  Not meaningful.  \n                      \nProvision for Credit Losses The provision for \ncredit losses was $1.7 billion for the second \nquarter and $2.7 billion for the first six    \nmonths of 2020, representing increases of $1.4\nbillion and $2.0 billion, respectively, from  \nthe same periods of 2019. During 2020, the    \nCompany adopted accounting guidance which     \nchanged previous impairment recognition to a  \nmodel that is based on expected losses rather \nthan incurred losses. In March 2020 economic  \nconditions began to deteriorate, and          \nsubsequently continued to deteriorate during  \nthe second quarter, due to the impact of the  \nCOVID-19health crisis. As a result, economic  \nprojections for the Gross Domestic Product    \ndeclined dramatically and unemployment levels \nincreased significantly due to information    \nrelated to the evolving impacts of the        \nCOVID-19health crisis. This resulted in the   \nCompany\u2019s expectations related to loan        \ndelinquencies, credit risk ratings,           \nnonperforming assets and related future credit\nlosses to reflect deteriorating credit        \nquality. As a result, the Company recognized  \nincreases of $1.3 billion and $1.9 billion,   \nduring the second quarter and first six months\nof 2020, respectively, in the allowance for   \ncredit losses due to these deteriorating      \neconomic conditions. The expected loss        \nestimates consider various factors including  \nthe changing economic conditions, potential   \nmitigating effects of government stimulus,    \nestimated duration of the health crisis,      \ncustomer specific information impacting       \nchanges in risk ratings, projected            \ndelinquencies and the impact of industrywide  \nloan modification efforts designed to limit   \nlong-term effects of the pandemic, among other\nfactors. Net charge-offs increased $87 million\n(24.9 percent) and $113 million (15.8 percent)\nin the second quarter and first six months of \n2020, respectively, compared with the same    \nperiods of the prior year, primarily due to   \nhigher commercial loan, commercial real estate\nloan and retail leasing net charge-offs,      \npartially offset by a decrease in other retail\nloan net charge-offs. The increases in retail \nleasing charge-offs reflected the inclusion of\nend of term losses on residual lease values as\nof January 1, 2020. Refer to \u201cCorporate Risk  \nProfile\u201d for further information on the       \nprovision for credit losses, net charge-offs, \nnonperforming assets and other factors        \nconsidered by the Company in assessing the    \ncredit quality of the loan portfolio and      \nestablishing the allowance for credit losses. \nNoninterest Income Noninterest income was $2.6\nbillion in the second quarter and $5.1 billion\nin the first six months of 2020, representing \nincreases of $124 million (5.0 percent) and   \n$358 million (7.5 percent), respectively,     \ncompared with the same periods of 2019. The   \nincreases from a year ago reflected higher    \nmortgage banking revenue, commercial products \nrevenue, trust and investment management fees \nand gains on sales of investment securities,  \npartially offset by lower payment services    \nrevenue, deposit service charges and other    \nnoninterest income. Mortgage banking revenue  \nincreased due to higher mortgage production   \nand stronger gain on sale margins, partially  \noffset by changes in mortgage servicing rights\n(\u201cMSRs\u201d) valuations, net of hedging           \nactivities. The Company expects mortgage      \nbanking revenue to decline in the third       \nquarter of 2020, as compared with the second  \nquarter of 2020, reflecting slower refinancing\nactivity for the industry. Commercial products\nrevenue increased primarily due to higher     \ncorporate bond issuance fees and trading      \nrevenue. Trust and investment management fees \nwere higher due to business growth and        \nfavorable market conditions over the past     \nyear. Payment services fee revenue decreased  \nreflecting lower merchant processing services \nrevenue, credit and debit card revenue, and   \ncorporate payment products revenue, driven by \nlower sales volume due to the worldwide impact\nof the COVID-19pandemic on consumer and       \nbusiness spending. Payment services revenue is\nlikely to be adversely affected through the   \nremainder of 2020 due to reduced consumer and \nbusiness spending activity.

Deposit \nservice charges decreased primarily due to    \nlower volume and higher fee waivers related to\ncustomers impacted by COVID-19.Other          \nnoninterest income decreased due to lower     \nequity investment income, lower tax-          \nadvantagedinvestment syndication revenue and  \nasset impairments as a result of property     \ndamage from civil unrest in the second quarter\nof 2020. The decrease in other noninterest    \nincome in the first six months of 2020,       \ncompared with the first six months of 2019,   \nwas partially offset by gains on sale of      \ncertain businesses in the first quarter of    \n2020. Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense \nwas $3.3 billion in the second quarter and    \n$6.6 billion in the first six months of 2020, \nrepresenting increases of $165 million (5.2   \npercent) and $394 million (6.3 percent),      \nrespectively, over the same periods of 2019.  \nThe increases from a year ago were driven by  \nincremental costs related to COVID-19and      \nrevenue-related expenses due to higher        \nmortgage production and capital markets       \nactivities of $150 million in the second      \nquarter and $299 million in the first six     \nmonths of 2020, in addition to business       \ninvestments, including increased digital      \ncapabilities. The categories of expense       \nimpacted include higher personnel expense,    \ntechnology and communications expense, and    \nother noninterest expense, partially offset by\nlower marketing and business development      \nexpense. Compensation expense increased due to\nthe impacts of merit increases and higher     \nvariable compensation related to business     \nproduction within mortgage banking and fixed  \nincome capital markets. Technology and        \ncommunications expense increased primarily due\nto capital expenditures supporting business   \ngrowth. Other noninterest expense increased,  \nreflecting $79 million and $179 million of    \nexpenses in the second quarter and first six  \nmonths of 2020, respectively, related to      \nCOVID-19,and higher state franchise taxes,    \npartially offset by lower costs related to    \ntax-advantagedprojects in 2020. Incremental   \ncosts related to COVID-19include increased    \nliabilities driven by the Company\u2019s exposure  \nas a credit card processor to charge-back risk\non undelivered goods and services, including  \nprepaid airline tickets, as well as expenses  \nrelated to paying premium compensation to     \nfront-line workers and providing a safe       \nworking environment for employees. The Company\nexpects these incremental COVID-19costs to    \nbegin to dissipate in the second half of 2020.\nMarketing and business development expense    \ndecreased due to the timing of marketing      \ncampaigns and a reduction in travel as a      \nresult of COVID-19. Income Tax Expense The    \nprovision for income taxes was $64 million (an\neffective rate of 8.4 percent) for the second \nquarter and $324 million (an effective rate of\n14.7 percent) for the first six months of     \n2020, compared with $449 million (an effective\nrate of 19.7 percent) and $827 million (an    \neffective rate of 19.0 percent) for the same  \nperiods of 2019. The reduced tax rates for    \n2020 were primarily a result of reduced pretax\nincome being impacted by current economic     \nconditions, including the higher provision for\ncredit losses. For further information on     \nincome taxes, refer to Note 11 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements. BALANCE    \nSHEET ANALYSIS Loans The Company\u2019s loan       \nportfolio was $310.3 billion at June 30, 2020,\ncompared with $296.1 billion at December 31,  \n2019, an increase of $14.2 billion (4.8       \npercent). The increase was driven by higher   \ncommercial loans, commercial real estate loans\nand residential mortgages, partially offset by\nlower credit card loans and other retail      \nloans. Commercial loans increased $16.4       \nbillion (15.8 percent) at June 30, 2020,      \ncompared with December 31, 2019, reflecting   \nthe utilization of bank credit facilities by  \ncustomers to support liquidity                \n                     \n  6    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table\u00a04    Available-for-Sale Investment    \n             Securities                       \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Information related to asset and       \n       mortgage-backed securities included    \n  (a)  above is presented based upon          \n       weighted-average maturities that take  \n       into account anticipated future        \n       prepayments.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Information related to obligations of  \n       state and political subdivisions is    \n       presented based upon yield to first    \n  (b)  optional call date if the security is  \n       purchased at a premium, and yield to   \n       maturity if the security is purchased  \n       at par or a discount.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Maturity calculations for obligations  \n       of state and political subdivisions    \n       are based on the first optional call   \n  (c)  date for securities with a fair value  \n       above par and the contractual          \n       maturity date for securities with a    \n       fair value equal to or below par.      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Yields on investment securities are    \n       computed based on amortized cost       \n       balances.

Residential mortgages held in the   \nloan portfolio increased $743 million (1.1    \npercent) at June 30, 2020, compared with      \nDecember 31, 2019, as origination activity    \nmore than offset the effect of customers      \npaying down balances in the first six months  \nof 2020 given the lower interest rate         \nenvironment. Residential mortgages originated \nand placed in the Company\u2019s loan portfolio    \ninclude well-secured jumbo mortgages and      \nbranch-originated first lien home equity loans\nto borrowers with high credit quality. Credit \ncard loans decreased $3.5 billion (14.2       \npercent) at June 30, 2020, compared with      \nDecember 31, 2019, reflecting reduced consumer\nspending in 2020 driven by the impact of      \nCOVID-19. Other retail loans decreased $706   \nmillion (1.2 percent) at June 30, 2020,       \ncompared with December 31, 2019, the result of\ndecreases in home equity loans, auto loans and\nrevolving credit balances, partially offset by\nan increase in installment loans. The Company \ngenerally retains portfolio loans through     \nmaturity; however, the Company\u2019s intent may   \nchange over time based upon various factors   \nsuch as ongoing asset/liability management    \nactivities, assessment of product             \nprofitability, credit risk, liquidity needs,  \nand capital implications. If the Company\u2019s    \nintent or ability to hold an existing         \nportfolio loan changes, it is transferred to  \nloans held for sale. Loans Held for Sale Loans\nheld for sale, consisting primarily of        \nresidential mortgages to be sold in the       \nsecondary market, were $8.2 billion at June   \n30, 2020, compared with $5.6 billion at       \nDecember 31, 2019. The increase in loans held \nfor sale was principally due to a higher level\nof mortgage loan closings in the second       \nquarter of 2020 given the lower interest rate \nenvironment, compared with the fourth quarter \nof 2019. Almost all of the residential        \nmortgage loans the Company originates or      \npurchases for sale follow guidelines that     \nallow the loans to be sold into existing,     \nhighly liquid secondary markets; in particular\nin government agency transactions and to      \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d).    \nInvestment Securities Available-for-          \nsaleinvestment securities totaled $128.1      \nbillion at June 30, 2020, compared with $122.6\nbillion at December 31, 2019. The $5.5 billion\n(4.5 percent) increase was primarily due to a \n$3.1 billion favorable change in net          \nunrealized gains (losses) on available-for-   \nsaleinvestment securities and $2.3 billion of \nnet investment purchases. The Company had no  \noutstanding investment securities classified  \nas held-to-maturityat June 30, 2020 and       \nDecember 31, 2019. The Company\u2019s available-   \nfor-saleinvestment securities are carried at  \nfair value with changes in fair value         \nreflected in other comprehensive income (loss)\nunless a portion of a security\u2019s unrealized   \nloss is related to credit and an allowance for\ncredit losses is necessary. At June 30, 2020, \nthe Company\u2019s net unrealized gains on         \navailable-for-saleinvestment securities were  \n$3.6 billion, compared with $496 million at   \nDecember 31, 2019. The favorable change in net\nunrealized gains was primarily due to         \nincreases in the fair value of U.S. Treasury, \nmortgage-backed, and state and political      \nsecurities as a result of changes in interest \nrates. Gross unrealized losses on available-  \nfor-saleinvestment securities totaled $39     \nmillion at June 30, 2020, compared with       \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    7  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n$448 million at December 31, 2019. At June 30,\n2020, the Company had no plans to sell        \nsecurities with unrealized losses, and        \nbelieves it is more likely than not that it   \nwould not be required to sell such securities \nbefore recovery of their amortized cost. Refer\nto Notes 3 and 14 in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for further information  \non investment securities. Deposits Total      \ndeposits were $413.3 billion at June 30, 2020,\ncompared with $361.9 billion at December 31,  \n2019. The $51.4 billion (14.2 percent)        \nincrease in total deposits reflected increases\nin noninterest-bearing and total savings      \ndeposits, partially offset by a decrease in   \ntime deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits   \nincreased $34.1 billion (45.2 percent) at June\n30, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019,    \nprimarily due to higher Corporate and         \nCommercial Banking, Consumer and Business     \nBanking, and Wealth Management and Investment \nServices balances. Money market deposit       \nbalances increased $9.0 billion (7.5 percent) \nat June 30, 2020, compared with December 31,  \n2019, primarily due to higher Corporate and   \nCommercial Banking, and Consumer and Business \nBanking balances, partially offset by a       \ndecrease in Wealth Management and Investment  \nServices balances. Interest checking balances \nincreased $7.6 billion (10.0 percent), while  \nsavings account balances increased $5.2       \nbillion (11.1 percent), both driven by higher \nConsumer and Business Banking balances. The   \ngrowth in noninterest-bearing and total       \nsavings deposits was primarily a result of the\neconomic impact of the COVID-19pandemic on the\nworld economy resulting in actions by the     \nfederal government to increase liquidity in   \nthe financial system, customers maintaining   \nbalance sheet liquidity by utilizing existing \ncredit facilities and government stimulus     \nprograms. Time deposits decreased $4.6 billion\n(10.7 percent) at June 30, 2020, compared with\nDecember 31, 2019, driven by a decrease in    \nthose deposits managed as an alternative to   \nother funding sources, based largely on       \nrelative pricing and liquidity                \ncharacteristics. Borrowings The Company       \nutilizes both short-term and long-term        \nborrowings as part of its asset/liability     \nmanagement and funding strategies. Short-term \nborrowings, which include federal funds       \npurchased, commercial paper, repurchase       \nagreements, borrowings secured by high-grade  \nassets and other short-term borrowings, were  \n$20.6 billion at June 30, 2020, compared with \n$23.7 billion at December 31, 2019. The $3.1  \nbillion (13.2 percent) decrease in short-term \nborrowings was primarily due to a decrease in \nshort-term Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d)    \nadvances and other short-term borrowings      \nbalances, partially offset by higher          \ncommercial paper, repurchase agreement and    \nfederal funds purchased balances. Long-term   \ndebt was $42.6 billion at June 30, 2020,      \ncompared with $40.2 billion at December 31,   \n2019. The $2.4 billion (6.0 percent) increase \nwas primarily due to $3.3 billion of bank note\nand $1.5 billion of medium-term note          \nissuances, partially offset by $3.2 billion of\nbank note repayments and maturities. Refer to \nthe \u201cLiquidity Risk Management\u201d section for   \ndiscussion of liquidity management of the     \nCompany. CORPORATE RISK PROFILE Overview      \nManaging risks is an essential part of        \nsuccessfully operating a financial services   \ncompany. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors has \napproved a risk management framework which    \nestablishes governance and risk management    \nrequirements for all risk-taking activities.  \nThis framework includes Company and business  \nline risk appetite statements which set       \nboundaries for the types and amount of risk   \nthat may be undertaken in pursuing business   \nobjectives and initiatives. The Board of      \nDirectors, primarily through its Risk         \nManagement Committee, oversees performance    \nrelative to the risk management framework,    \nrisk appetite statements, and other policy    \nrequirements. The Executive Risk Committee    \n(\u201cERC\u201d), which is chaired by the Chief Risk   \nOfficer and includes the Chief Executive      \nOfficer and other members of the executive    \nmanagement team, oversees execution against   \nthe risk management framework and risk        \nappetite statements. The ERC focuses on       \ncurrent and emerging risks, including         \nstrategic and reputation risks, by directing  \ntimely and comprehensive actions. Senior      \noperating committees have also been           \nestablished, each responsible for overseeing a\nspecified category of risk. The Company\u2019s most\nprominent risk exposures are credit, interest \nrate, market, liquidity, operational,         \ncompliance, strategic, and reputation.        \nLeveraging the Company\u2019s risk management      \nframework, the specific impacts of COVID-19and\nrelated risks are identified for each of the  \nmost prominent exposures. Oversight and       \ngovernance is managed through a centralized   \ncommand center which escalates through the    \nERC. The Board of Directors also oversees the \nCompany\u2019s responsiveness to the               \nCOVID-19pandemic. Credit risk is the risk of  \nnot collecting the interest and/or the        \nprincipal balance of a loan, investment or    \nderivative contract when it is due. Interest  \nrate risk is the potential reduction of net   \ninterest income or market valuations as a     \nresult of changes in interest rates. Market   \nrisk arises from fluctuations in interest     \nrates, foreign exchange rates, and security   \nprices that may result in changes in the      \nvalues of financial                           \n                     \n  8    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \ninstruments, such as trading and available-   \nfor-salesecurities, mortgage loans held for   \nsale (\u201cMLHFS\u201d), MSRs and derivatives that are \naccounted for on a fair value basis. Liquidity\nrisk is the possible inability to fund        \nobligations or new business at a reasonable   \ncost and in a timely manner. Operational risk \nis the risk to current or projected financial \ncondition arising from inadequate or failed   \ninternal processes or systems, people, or     \nadverse external events, including the risk of\nloss resulting from breaches in data security.\nOperational risk can also include the risk of \nloss due to failures by third parties with    \nwhich the Company does business. Compliance   \nrisk is the risk that the Company may suffer  \nlegal or regulatory sanctions, financial      \nlosses, and reputational damage if it fails to\nadhere to compliance requirements. Strategic  \nrisk is the risk to current or projected      \nfinancial condition arising from adverse      \nbusiness decisions, poor implementation of    \nbusiness decisions, or lack of responsiveness \nto changes in the banking industry and        \noperating environment. Reputation risk is the \nrisk to current or anticipated earnings,      \ncapital, or franchise or enterprise value     \narising from negative public opinion. This    \nrisk may impair the Company\u2019s competitiveness \nby affecting its ability to establish new     \nrelationships or services offer new services  \nor continue serving existing relationships. In\naddition to the risks identified above, other \nrisk factors exist that may impact the        \nCompany. Refer to \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this      \nreport and in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on  \nForm 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2019,\nfor a detailed discussion of these factors.   \nThe Company\u2019s Board and management-level      \ngovernance committees are supported by a      \n\u201cthree lines of defense\u201d model for            \nestablishing effective checks and balances.   \nThe first line of defense, the business lines,\nmanages risks in conformity with established  \nlimits and policy requirements. In turn,      \nbusiness line leaders and their risk officers \nestablish programs to ensure conformity with  \nthese limits and policy requirements. The     \nsecond line of defense, which includes the    \nChief Risk Officer\u2019s organization as well as  \npolicy and oversight activities of corporate  \nsupport functions, translates risk appetite   \nand strategy into actionable risk limits and  \npolicies. The second line of defense monitors \nfirst line of defense conformity with limits  \nand policies, and provides reporting and      \nescalation of emerging risks and other        \nconcerns to senior management and the Risk    \nManagement Committee of the Board of          \nDirectors. The third line of defense, internal\naudit, is responsible for providing the Audit \nCommittee of the Board of Directors and senior\nmanagement with independent assessment and    \nassurance regarding the effectiveness of the  \nCompany\u2019s governance, risk management and     \ncontrol processes. Management regularly       \nprovides reports to the Risk Management       \nCommittee of the Board of Directors. The Risk \nManagement Committee discusses with management\nthe Company\u2019s risk management performance, and\nprovides a summary of key risks to the entire \nBoard of Directors, covering the status of    \nexisting matters, areas of potential future   \nconcern and specific information on certain   \ntypes of loss events. The Risk Management     \nCommittee considers quarterly reports by      \nmanagement assessing the Company\u2019s performance\nrelative to the risk appetite statements and  \nthe associated risk limits, including:        \n                                              \n       Macroeconomic environment and other    \n       qualitative considerations, such as    \n  \u2022    regulatory and compliance changes,     \n       litigation developments, and           \n       technology and cybersecurity;          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit measures, including adversely   \n  \u2022    rated and nonperforming loans,         \n       leveraged transactions, credit         \n       concentrations and lending limits;     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Interest rate and market risk,         \n  \u2022    including market value and net income  \n       simulation, and trading-related Value  \n       at Risk (\u201cVaR\u201d);                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Liquidity risk, including funding      \n  \u2022    projections under various stressed     \n       scenarios;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       Operational and compliance risk,       \n       including losses stemming from events  \n       such as fraud, processing errors,      \n       control breaches, breaches in data     \n  \u2022    security or adverse business           \n       decisions, as well as reporting on     \n       technology performance, and various    \n       legal and regulatory compliance        \n       measures;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Capital ratios and projections,        \n  \u2022    including regulatory measures and      \n       stressed scenarios; and                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Strategic and reputation risk          \n  \u2022    considerations, impacts and            \n       responses.                             \n                                              \nCredit Risk Management The Company\u2019s strategy \nfor credit risk management includes well-     \ndefined, centralized credit policies, uniform \nunderwriting criteria, and ongoing risk       \nmonitoring and review processes for all       \ncommercial and consumer credit exposures. In  \nevaluating its credit risk, the Company       \nconsiders changes, if any, in underwriting    \nactivities, the loan portfolio composition    \n(including product mix and geographic,        \nindustry or customer-specific concentrations),\ncollateral values, trends in loan performance \nand macroeconomic factors, such as changes in \nunemployment rates, gross domestic product and\nconsumer bankruptcy filings, as well as the   \npotential impact on customers and the domestic\neconomy resulting from new tariffs or         \nincreases in existing tariffs, and the        \nCOVID-19pandemic. The Risk Management         \nCommittee oversees the Company\u2019s credit risk  \nmanagement process. In addition, credit       \nquality ratings as defined by the Company, are\nan important part of the Company\u2019s            \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    9  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \noverall credit risk management and evaluation \nof its allowance for credit losses. Loans with\na pass rating represent those loans not       \nclassified on the Company\u2019s rating scale for  \nproblem credits, as minimal risk has been     \nidentified. Loans with a special mention or   \nclassified rating, including loans that are 90\ndays or more past due and still accruing,     \nnonaccrual loans, those loans considered      \ntroubled debt restructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d), and    \nloans in a junior lien position that are      \ncurrent but are behind a modified or          \ndelinquent loan in a first lien position,     \nencompass all loans held by the Company that  \nit considers to have a potential or well-     \ndefined weakness that may put full collection \nof contractual cash flows at risk. The        \nCompany\u2019s internal credit quality ratings for \nconsumer loans are primarily based on         \ndelinquency and nonperforming status, except  \nfor a limited population of larger loans      \nwithin those portfolios that are individually \nevaluated. For this limited population, the   \ndetermination of the internal credit quality  \nrating may also consider collateral value and \ncustomer cash flows. Refer to Note 4 in the   \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements for\nfurther discussion of the Company\u2019s loan      \nportfolios including internal credit quality  \nratings. In addition, refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s  \nDiscussion and Analysis \u2014 Credit Risk         \nManagement\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on \nForm 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2019,\nfor a more detailed discussion on credit risk \nmanagement processes. The Company manages its \ncredit risk, in part, through diversification \nof its loan portfolio which is achieved       \nthrough limit setting by product type         \ncriteria, such as industry, and identification\nof credit concentrations. As part of its      \nnormal business activities, the Company offers\na broad array of lending products. The Company\ncategorizes its loan portfolio into two       \nsegments, which is the level at which it      \ndevelops and documents a systematic           \nmethodology to determine the allowance for    \ncredit losses. The Company\u2019s two loan         \nportfolio segments are commercial lending and \nconsumer lending. The commercial lending      \nsegment includes loans and leases made to     \nsmall business, middle market, large          \ncorporate, commercial real estate, financial  \ninstitution, non-profitand public sector      \ncustomers. Key risk characteristics relevant  \nto commercial lending segment loans include   \nthe industry and geography of the borrower\u2019s  \nbusiness, purpose of the loan, repayment      \nsource, borrower\u2019s debt capacity and financial\nflexibility, loan covenants, and nature of    \npledged collateral, if any. These risk        \ncharacteristics, among others, are considered \nin determining estimates about the likelihood \nof default by the borrowers and the severity  \nof loss in the event of default. The Company  \nconsiders these risk characteristics in       \nassigning internal risk ratings to, or        \nforecasting losses on, these loans, which are \nthe significant factors in determining the    \nallowance for credit losses for loans in the  \ncommercial lending segment. The consumer      \nlending segment represents loans and leases   \nmade to consumer customers, including         \nresidential mortgages, credit card loans, and \nother retail loans such as revolving consumer \nlines, auto loans and leases, home equity     \nloans and lines, and student loans, a run-    \noffportfolio. Home equity or second mortgage  \nloans are junior lien closed-endaccounts fully\ndisbursed at origination. These loans         \ntypically are fixed rate loans, secured by    \nresidential real estate, with a 10-or         \n15-yearfixed payment amortization schedule.   \nHome equity lines are revolving accounts      \ngiving the borrower the ability to draw and   \nrepay balances repeatedly, up to a maximum    \ncommitment, and are secured by residential    \nreal estate. These include accounts in either \na first or junior lien position. Typical terms\non home equity lines in the portfolio are     \nvariable rates benchmarked to the prime rate, \nwith a 10-or 15-yeardraw period during which a\nminimum payment is equivalent to the monthly  \ninterest, followed by a 20-or                 \n10-yearamortization period, respectively. At  \nJune 30, 2020, substantially all of the       \nCompany\u2019s home equity lines were in the draw  \nperiod. Approximately $1.2 billion, or 10     \npercent, of the outstanding home equity line  \nbalances at June 30, 2020, will enter the     \namortization period within the next 36 months.\nKey risk characteristics relevant to consumer \nlending segment loans primarily relate to the \nborrowers\u2019 capacity and willingness to repay  \nand include unemployment rates and other      \neconomic factors, customer payment history and\ncredit scores, and in some cases, updated     \nloan-to-value(\u201cLTV\u201d) information reflecting   \ncurrent market conditions on real estate-based\nloans. These and other risk characteristics,  \nincluding elevated risk resulting from the    \nCOVID-19pandemic, are reflected in forecasts  \nof delinquency levels, bankruptcies and losses\nwhich are the primary factors in determining  \nthe allowance for credit losses for the       \nconsumer lending segment. The Company further \ndisaggregates its loan portfolio segments into\nvarious classes based on their underlying risk\ncharacteristics. The two classes within the   \ncommercial lending segment are commercial     \nloans and commercial real estate loans. The   \nthree classes within the consumer lending     \nsegment are residential mortgages, credit card\nloans and other retail loans. The Company\u2019s   \nconsumer lending segment utilizes several     \ndistinct business processes and channels to   \noriginate consumer credit, including          \ntraditional branch lending, mobile and on-    \nlinebanking, indirect lending, correspondent  \nbanks and loan brokers.

Residential mortgage \noriginations are generally limited to prime   \nborrowers and are performed through the       \nCompany\u2019s branches, loan production offices,  \nmobile and on-lineservices and a wholesale    \nnetwork of originators. The Company may retain\nresidential mortgage loans it originates on   \nits balance sheet or sell the loans into the  \nsecondary market while retaining the servicing\nrights and customer relationships. Utilizing  \nthe secondary markets enables the Company to  \neffectively reduce its credit and other       \nasset/liability risks. For residential        \nmortgages that are retained in the Company\u2019s  \nportfolio and for home equity and second      \nmortgages, credit risk is also diversified by \ngeography and managed by adherence to LTV and \nborrower credit criteria during the           \nunderwriting process. The Company estimates   \nupdated LTV information on its outstanding    \nresidential mortgages quarterly, based on a   \nmethod that combines automated valuation model\nupdates and relevant home price indices. LTV  \nis the ratio of the loan\u2019s outstanding        \nprincipal balance to the current estimate of  \nproperty value. For home equity and second    \nmortgages, combined loan-to-value(\u201cCLTV\u201d) is  \nthe combination of the first mortgage original\nprincipal balance and the second lien         \noutstanding principal balance, relative to the\ncurrent estimate of property value. Certain   \nloans do not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily   \ndue to lack of availability of relevant       \nautomated valuation model and/or home price   \nindices values, or lack of necessary valuation\ndata on acquired loans.

terms of a loan to \nmaximize the collection of amounts due when a \nborrower is experiencing financial            \ndifficulties or is expected to experience     \ndifficulties in the near-term. In most cases  \nthe modification is either a concessionary    \nreduction in interest rate, extension of the  \nmaturity date or reduction in the principal   \nbalance that would otherwise not be           \nconsidered. Troubled Debt Restructurings      \nConcessionary modifications are classified as \nTDRs unless the modification results in only  \nan insignificant delay in the payments to be  \nreceived. TDRs accrue interest if the borrower\ncomplies with the revised terms and conditions\nand has demonstrated repayment performance at \na level commensurate with the modified terms  \nover several payment cycles, which is         \ngenerally six months or greater. At June 30,  \n2020, performing TDRs were $3.5 billion,      \ncompared with $3.8 billion at December 31,    \n2019. The Company continues to work with      \ncustomers to modify loans for borrowers who   \nare experiencing financial difficulties. Many \nof the Company\u2019s TDRs are determined on a     \ncase-by-casebasis in connection with ongoing  \nloan collection processes. The modifications  \nvary within each of the Company\u2019s loan        \nclasses. Commercial lending segment TDRs      \ngenerally include extensions of the maturity  \ndate and may be accompanied by an increase or \ndecrease to the interest rate. The Company may\nalso work with the borrower to make other     \nchanges to the loan to mitigate losses, such  \nas obtaining additional collateral and/or     \nguarantees to support the loan. The Company   \nhas also implemented certain residential      \nmortgage loan restructuring programs that may \nresult in TDRs. The Company modifies          \nresidential mortgage loans under Federal      \nHousing Administration, United States         \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and its own   \ninternal programs. Under these programs, the  \nCompany offers qualifying homeowners the      \nopportunity to permanently modify their loan  \nand achieve more affordable monthly payments  \nby providing loan concessions. These          \nconcessions may include adjustments to        \ninterest rates, conversion of adjustable rates\nto fixed rates, extensions of maturity dates  \nor deferrals of payments, capitalization of   \naccrued interest and/or outstanding advances, \nor in limited situations, partial forgiveness \nof loan principal.

A permanent loan     \nmodification is contingent on the customer    \nsuccessfully completing the trial period      \narrangement, and the loan documents are not   \nmodified until that time. The Company reports \nloans in a trial period arrangement as TDRs   \nand continues to report them as TDRs after the\ntrial period. Credit card and other retail    \nloan TDRs are generally part of distinct      \nrestructuring programs providing customers    \nmodification solutions over a specified time  \nperiod, generally up to 60 months. In         \naccordance with regulatory guidance, the      \nCompany considers secured consumer loans that \nhave had debt discharged through bankruptcy   \nwhere the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt\nto be TDRs. If the loan amount exceeds the    \ncollateral value, the loan is charged down to \ncollateral value and the remaining amount is  \nreported as nonperforming. Loan modifications \nor concessions granted to customers resulting \ndirectly from the effects of the              \nCOVID-19pandemic, who were otherwise in       \ncurrent payment status, are not considered to \nbe TDRs.

\nTDRs, in limited circumstances, to assist     \nborrowers experiencing temporary hardships.   \nShort-term consumer lending modification      \nprograms include payment reductions, deferrals\nof up to three past due payments, and the     \nability to return to current status if the    \nborrower makes required payments. The Company \nmay also make short-term modifications to     \ncommercial lending loans, with the most common\nmodification being an extension of the        \nmaturity date of three months or less. Such   \nextensions generally are used when the        \nmaturity date is imminent and the borrower is \nexperiencing some level of financial stress,  \nbut the Company believes the borrower will pay\nall contractual amounts owed. COVID-19Payment \nRelief The Company has offered payment relief,\nincluding forbearance, payment deferrals and  \nother customer accommodations, to assist      \nborrowers that have experienced financial     \nhardship resulting from the effects of the    \nCOVID-19pandemic. The majority of these       \nborrowers were not delinquent on payments at  \nthe time they received the payment relief.    \nThrough June 30, 2020, the Company had        \napproved approximately 249,000 loan           \nmodifications for these borrowers,            \nrepresenting approximately $20.0 billion, or  \n6.4 percent, of loans included on its         \nconsolidated balance sheet. The loans modified\nconsisted primarily of payment forbearance or \ndeferrals of 90 days or less. A portion of the\nborrowers who received account modifications  \nare no longer participating in these payment  \nrelief programs, as the programs are generally\nshort-term; and at June 30, 2020,             \napproximately 130,000 were currently in an    \nactive payment relief program. The recognition\nof delinquent or nonaccrual loans and loan net\ncharge-offs may be delayed for those customers\nenrolled in these payment relief programs who \nwould have otherwise moved into past due or   \nnonaccrual status, as these customer accounts \ndo not continue to age during the period the  \npayment delay is provided.

Nonperforming assets include          \nnonaccrual loans, restructured loans not      \nperforming in accordance with modified terms  \nand not accruing interest, restructured loans \nthat have not met the performance period      \nrequired to return to accrual status, other   \nreal estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d) and other          \nnonperforming assets owned by the Company.    \nInterest payments collected from assets on    \nnonaccrual status are generally applied       \nagainst the principal balance and not recorded\nas income. However, interest income may be    \nrecognized for interest payments if the       \nremaining carrying amount of the loan is      \nbelieved to be collectible. At June 30, 2020, \ntotal nonperforming assets were $1.2 billion, \ncompared to $829 million at December 31, 2019.\nThe $344 million (41.5 percent) increase in   \nnonperforming assets was driven by increases  \nin nonperforming commercial and commercial    \nreal estate loans. The ratio of total         \nnonperforming assets to total loans and other \nreal estate was 0.38 percent at June 30, 2020,\ncompared with 0.28 percent at December 31,    \n2019. The Company expects nonperforming assets\nto increase given current economic conditions.\nOREO was $52 million at June 30, 2020,        \ncompared with $78 million at December 31,     \n2019, and was related to foreclosed properties\nthat previously secured loan balances. These  \nbalances exclude foreclosed GNMA loans whose  \nrepayments are primarily insured by the       \nFederal Housing Administration or guaranteed  \nby the United States Department of Veterans   \nAffairs.

Loan Net Charge-Offs Total loan   \nnet charge-offs were $437 million for the     \nsecond quarter and $830 million for the first \nsix months of 2020, compared with $350 million\nand $717 million, respectively, for the same  \nperiods of 2019. The ratio of total loan net  \ncharge-offs to average loans outstanding on an\nannualized basis for the second quarter and   \nfirst six months of 2020 was 0.55 percent and \n0.54 percent, respectively, compared with 0.49\npercent and 0.50 percent, respectively, for   \nthe same periods of 2019. The year-over-year  \nincreases in net charge-offs reflected higher \ncommercial loan, commercial real estate loan  \nand retail leasing net charge-offs, partially \noffset by a decrease in other retail loan net \ncharge-offs. The increase in retail leasing   \ncharge-offs reflected the inclusion of end of \nterm losses on residual lease values as of    \nJanuary 1, 2020. The Company expects net      \ncharge-offs to increase given current economic\nconditions. Analysis and Determination of the \nAllowance for Credit Losses Prior to January  \n1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses was  \nestablished to reserve for probable and       \nestimable losses incurred in the Company\u2019s    \nloan and lease portfolio, including unfunded  \ncredit commitments. Effective January 1, 2020,\nthe Company adopted new accounting guidance   \nwhich changed previous impairment recognition \nto a model that is based on expected losses   \nrather than incurred losses. The allowance for\ncredit losses is increased through provisions \ncharged to earnings and reduced by net charge-\noffs. Management evaluates the appropriateness\nof the allowance for credit losses on a       \nquarterly basis. The allowance considers      \nexpected losses for the remaining lives of the\napplicable assets, inclusive of expected      \nrecoveries. Multiple economic scenarios are   \nconsidered over a three-year reasonable and   \nsupportable forecast period, which            \nincorporates historical loss experience in    \nyears two and three. After the forecast       \nperiod, the Company fully reverts to long-term\nhistorical loss experience, adjusted for      \nprepayments and characteristics of the current\nloan and lease portfolio, to estimate losses  \nover the remaining lives. The economic        \nscenarios are updated at least quarterly, and \nare designed to provide a range of reasonable \nestimates, both better and worse than current \nexpectations. Scenarios are weighted based on \nthe Company\u2019s expectation of future           \nconditions. Final loss estimates also consider\nfactors affecting credit losses not reflected \nin the scenarios, due to the unique aspects of\ncurrent conditions and expectations. These    \nfactors may include loan servicing practices, \nregulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and        \nmonetary policy actions. Because business     \nprocesses and credit risks associated with    \nunfunded credit commitments are essentially   \nthe same as for loans, the Company utilizes   \nsimilar processes to estimate its liability   \nfor unfunded credit commitments, which is     \nincluded in other liabilities in the          \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Both the allowance\nfor loan losses and the liability for unfunded\ncredit commitments are included in the        \nCompany\u2019s analysis of credit losses and       \nreported reserve ratios. The allowance        \nrecorded for credit losses utilizes forward-  \nlooking expected loss models to consider a    \nvariety of factors affecting lifetime credit  \nlosses. These factors include loan and        \nborrower characteristics, such as internal    \nrisk ratings on commercial loans and consumer \ncredit scores, delinquency status, collateral \ntype and available valuation information,     \nconsideration of end-of-termlosses on lease   \nresiduals, and the remaining term of the loan,\nadjusted for expected prepayments. Where loans\ndo not exhibit similar risk characteristics,  \nan individual analysis is performed to        \nconsider expected credit losses. For each loan\nportfolio, model estimates are adjusted as    \nnecessary to consider any relevant changes in \nportfolio composition, lending policies,      \nunderwriting standards, risk management       \npractices or economic conditions that would   \naffect the accuracy of the model.             \n                      \n  18    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe results of the analysis are evaluated     \nquarterly to confirm the estimates are        \nappropriate for each loan portfolio. Expected \ncredit loss estimates also include            \nconsideration of expected cash recoveries on  \nloans previously charged-off, or expected     \nrecoveries on collateral-dependent loans where\nrecovery is expected through sale of the      \ncollateral. The allowance recorded for        \nindividually evaluated loans greater than $5  \nmillion in the commercial lending segment is  \nbased on an analysis utilizing expected cash  \nflows discounted using the original effective \ninterest rate, the observable market price of \nthe loan, or the fair value of the collateral,\nless selling costs, for collateral-dependent  \nloans. The allowance recorded for TDR loans in\nthe consumer lending segment is determined on \na homogenous pool basis utilizing expected    \ncash flows discounted using the original      \neffective interest rate of the pool. The      \nexpected cash flows on TDR loans consider     \nsubsequent payment defaults since             \nmodification, the borrower\u2019s ability to pay   \nunder the restructured terms, and the timing  \nand amount of payments. The allowance for     \ncollateral-dependent loans in the consumer    \nlending segment is determined based on the    \ncurrent fair value of the collateral less     \ncosts to sell. When evaluating the            \nappropriateness of the allowance for credit   \nlosses for any loans and lines in a junior    \nlien position, the Company considers the      \ndelinquency and modification status of the    \nfirst lien. At June 30, 2020, the Company     \nserviced the first lien on 39 percent of the  \nhome equity loans and lines in a junior lien  \nposition. The Company also considers the      \nstatus of first lien mortgage accounts        \nreported on customer credit bureau files when \nthe first lien is not serviced by the Company.\nRegardless of whether the Company services the\nfirst lien, an assessment is made of economic \nconditions, problem loans, recent loss        \nexperience and other factors in determining   \nthe allowance for credit losses. Based on the \navailable information, the Company estimated  \n$330 million or 2.4 percent of its total home \nequity portfolio at June 30, 2020, represented\nnon-delinquent junior liens where the first   \nlien was delinquent or modified, excluding    \nloans on COVID-related forbearance programs.  \nThe Company considers historical loss         \nexperience on the loans and lines in a junior \nlien position to establish loss estimates for \njunior lien loans and lines the Company       \nservices that are current, but the first lien \nis delinquent or modified. Historically, the  \nnumber of junior lien defaults has been a     \nsmall percentage of the total portfolio       \n(approximately 1 percent annually), while the \nlong-term average loss rate on loans that     \ndefault has been approximately 80 percent. In \naddition, the Company obtains updated credit  \nscores on its home equity portfolio each      \nquarter, and in some cases more frequently,   \nand uses this information in its loss         \nestimation methods. In its evaluation of the  \nallowance for credit losses, the Company also \nconsiders the increased risk of loss          \nassociated with home equity lines that are    \ncontractually scheduled to convert from a     \nrevolving status to a fully amortizing payment\nand with residential lines and loans that have\na balloon payoff provision. Beginning January \n1, 2020, when a loan portfolio is purchased,  \nthe acquired loans are divided into those     \nconsidered purchased with more than           \ninsignificant credit deterioration (\u201cPCD\u201d) and\nthose not considered purchased with more than \ninsignificant credit deterioration. An        \nallowance is established for each population  \nand considers product mix, risk               \ncharacteristics of the portfolio, bankruptcy  \nexperience, delinquency status, refreshed LTV \nratios when possible, and portfolio growth.   \nThe allowance established for purchased loans \nnot considered PCD is recognized through      \nprovision expense upon acquisition, whereas   \nthe allowance established for loans considered\nPCD at acquisition is offset by an increase in\nthe basis of the acquired loans. Any          \nsubsequent increases and decreases in the     \nallowance related to purchased loans are      \nrecognized through provision expense, with    \nfuture charge-offs charged to the allowance.  \nThe Company did not have a material amount of \nPCD loans included in its loan portfolio at   \nJune 30, 2020. The Company\u2019s methodology for  \ndetermining the appropriate allowance for     \ncredit losses for each loan segment also      \nconsiders the imprecision inherent in the     \nmethodologies used. As a result, amounts      \ndetermined under the methodologies described  \nabove are adjusted by management to consider  \nthe potential impact of other qualitative     \nfactors which include, but are not limited to,\nthe following: model imprecision, imprecision \nin economic scenario assumptions, and emerging\nrisks related to either changes in the        \neconomic environment that are affecting       \nspecific portfolio segments, or changes in    \nportfolio concentrations over time that may   \naffect model performance. The consideration of\nthese items results in adjustments to         \nallowance amounts included in the Company\u2019s   \nallowance for credit losses for each portfolio\nclass. Although the Company determined the    \namount of each element of the allowance       \nseparately and considers this process to be an\nimportant credit management tool, the entire  \nallowance for credit losses is available for  \nthe entire loan portfolio. The actual amount  \nof losses can vary significantly from the     \nestimated amounts.                            \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    19  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nAt June 30, 2020, the allowance for credit    \nlosses was $7.9 billion (2.54 percent of      \nperiod-end loans), compared with an allowance \nof $4.5 billion (1.52 percent of period-end   \nloans) at December 31, 2019. The ratio of the \nallowance for credit losses to nonperforming  \nloans was 737 percent at June 30, 2020,       \ncompared with 649 percent at December 31,     \n2019. The ratio of the allowance for credit   \nlosses to annualized loan net charge-offs was \n449 percent at June 30, 2020, compared with   \n309 percent of full year 2019 net charge-offs \nat December 31, 2019. The increase in the     \nallowance for credit losses of $3.4 billion   \n(75.7 percent) at June 30, 2020, compared with\nDecember 31, 2019, reflected the $1.5 billion \nimpact of the January 1, 2020 adoption of new \naccounting guidance, along with an additional \n$1.9 billion increase during the first six    \nmonths of 2020 to recognize the expected      \nlosses due to deteriorating economic          \nconditions driven by the impact of COVID-19 on\nthe domestic and global economies. Expected   \nloss estimates consider various factors       \nincluding the changing economic activity,     \nestimated mitigating effects of government    \nstimulus, estimated duration and severity of  \nthe health crisis, customer specific          \ninformation impacting changes in risk ratings,\nprojected delinquencies and the impact of     \nindustrywide loan modification efforts        \ndesigned to limit long-term effects of the    \nCOVID-19 pandemic, among other factors.       \nChanges in economic conditions as of June 30, \n2020 included significant reductions in       \neconomic activity related to actions taken by \ngovernmental authorities to slow the spread of\nCOVID-19. Record levels of unemployment, and  \nlower Gross Domestic Product estimates for    \n2020, as well as a slower pace of recovery in \nmanufacturing activity and oil prices, were   \nall observable changes in conditions that     \nincreased expected credit losses. At the same \ntime, record economic stimulus measures were  \nalso enacted, and additional measures are     \nbeing considered, with the intent to support  \nbusinesses and consumers through what is      \nexpected to be a period of reduced economic   \nactivity. To balance these offsetting factors,\neconomic scenarios updated through the end of \nthe second quarter of 2020 that produced      \nhigher quantitative loss estimates consistent \nwith the expected deterioration in reported   \neconomic statistics were evaluated in         \nconjunction with management\u2019s expectation that\ncurrent and potential future stimulus efforts,\nas well as industrywide availability of short-\nterm payment deferral programs, would mitigate\nlosses estimated from models based on         \nhistorical data from periods when mitigation  \nefforts were not as extensive. Overall, loss  \nexpectations are consistent with prior        \neconomic downturn experience, but the severity\nof the deterioration in current economic      \nconditions is not expected to persist over the\nlife of the loan portfolio, as some indicators\nof economic activity have already begun to    \nimprove directionally. The allowance for      \ncredit losses related to commercial lending   \nsegment loans increased $1.4 billion during   \nthe six months ended June 30, 2020, as        \nincreased loan volume and credit downgrades   \nduring the period reflected the impact of     \nCOVID-19 on certain industry sectors,         \nincluding the retail and restaurants,         \nautomobile, energy, media and entertainment,  \nlodging and airline industries that were      \nseverely impacted by virus containment        \nmeasures.

Compliance Risk  \nManagement The Company may suffer legal or    \nregulatory sanctions, material financial loss,\nor damage to its reputation through failure to\ncomply with laws, regulations, rules,         \nstandards of good practice, and codes of      \nconduct, including those related to compliance\nwith Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering   \nrequirements, sanctions compliance            \nrequirements as administered by the Office of \nForeign Assets Control, consumer protection   \nand other requirements. The Company has       \ncontrols and processes in place for the       \nassessment, identification, monitoring,       \nmanagement and reporting of compliance risks  \nand issues. Refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion \nand Analysis \u2014 Compliance Risk Management\u201d in \nthe Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for  \nthe year ended December 31, 2019, for further \ndiscussion on compliance risk management.     \nInterest Rate Risk Management In the banking  \nindustry, changes in interest rates are a     \nsignificant risk that can impact earnings and \nthe safety and soundness of an entity. The    \nCompany manages its exposure to changes in    \ninterest rates through asset and liability    \nmanagement activities within guidelines       \nestablished by its Asset Liability Management \nCommittee (\u201cALCO\u201d) and approved by the Board  \nof Directors. The ALCO has the responsibility \nfor approving and ensuring compliance with the\nALCO management policies, including interest  \nrate risk exposure. One way the Company       \nmeasures and analyzes its interest rate risk  \nis through net interest income simulation     \nanalysis. Simulation analysis incorporates    \nsubstantially all of the Company\u2019s assets and \nliabilities and off-balance sheet instruments,\ntogether with forecasted changes in the       \nbalance sheet and assumptions that reflect the\ncurrent interest rate environment. Through    \nthis simulation, management estimates the     \nimpact on net interest income of various      \ninterest rate changes that differ in the      \ndirection, amount and speed of change over    \ntime, as well as the shape of the yield curve.\nThis simulation includes assumptions about how\nthe balance sheet is likely to be affected by \nchanges in loan and deposit growth.           \nAssumptions are made to project interest rates\nfor new loans and deposits based on historical\nanalysis, management\u2019s outlook and re-pricing \nstrategies. These assumptions are reviewed and\nvalidated on a periodic basis with sensitivity\nanalysis being provided for key variables of  \nthe simulation. The results are reviewed      \nmonthly by the ALCO and are used to guide     \nasset/liability management strategies. The    \nCompany manages its interest rate risk        \nposition by holding assets with desired       \ninterest rate risk characteristics on its     \nbalance sheet, implementing certain pricing   \nstrategies for loans and deposits and         \nselecting derivatives and various funding and \ninvestment portfolio strategies. Table 9      \nsummarizes the projected impact to net        \ninterest income over the next 12 months of    \nvarious potential interest rate changes. The  \nsensitivity of the projected impact to net    \ninterest income over the next 12 months is    \ndependent on balance sheet growth, product    \nmix, deposit behavior, pricing and funding    \ndecisions. While the Company utilizes models  \nand assumptions based on historical           \ninformation and expected behaviors, actual    \noutcomes could vary significantly.            \n                      \n  22    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table\u00a09    Sensitivity of Net Interest      \n             Income                           \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  *  Given the level of interest rates,       \n     downward rate scenario is not computed.  \n                                              \nUse of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and\nOther Risks To manage the sensitivity of      \nearnings and capital to interest rate,        \nprepayment, credit, price and foreign currency\nfluctuations (asset and liability management  \npositions), the Company enters into derivative\ntransactions. The Company uses derivatives for\nasset and liability management purposes       \nprimarily in the following ways:              \n                                              \n       To convert fixed-rate debt from        \n  \u2022    fixed-rate payments to floating-rate   \n       payments;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       To convert the cash flows associated   \n  \u2022    with floating-rate debt from           \n       floating-rate payments to fixed-rate   \n       payments;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate changes in value of the    \n  \u2022    Company\u2019s unfunded mortgage loan       \n       commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs;    \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate remeasurement volatility   \n  \u2022    of foreign currency denominated        \n       balances; and                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate the volatility of the      \n  \u2022    Company\u2019s net investment in foreign    \n       operations driven by fluctuations in   \n       foreign currency exchange rates.       \n                                              \nIn addition, the Company enters into interest \nrate and foreign exchange derivative contracts\nto support the business requirements of its   \ncustomers (customer-related positions). The   \nCompany minimizes the market and liquidity    \nrisks of customer-related positions by either \nentering into similar offsetting positions    \nwith broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis  \nby entering into other derivative or non-     \nderivative financial instruments that         \npartially or fully offset the exposure from   \nthese customer-related positions. The Company \nmay enter into derivative contracts that are  \neither exchange-traded, centrally cleared     \nthrough clearinghouses or over-the-counter.   \nThe Company does not utilize derivatives for  \nspeculative purposes. The Company does not    \ndesignate all of the derivatives that it      \nenters into for risk management purposes as   \naccounting hedges because of the inefficiency \nof applying the accounting requirements and   \nmay instead elect fair value accounting for   \nthe related hedged items. In particular, the  \nCompany enters into interest rate swaps,      \nswaptions, forward commitments to buy to-be-  \nannounced securities (\u201cTBAs\u201d), U.S. Treasury  \nand Eurodollar futures and options on U.S.    \nTreasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in  \nthe value of its MSRs, but does not designate \nthose derivatives as accounting hedges.       \nAdditionally, the Company uses forward        \ncommitments to sell TBAs and other commitments\nto sell residential mortgage loans at         \nspecified prices to economically hedge the    \ninterest rate risk in its residential mortgage\nloan production activities. At June 30, 2020, \nthe Company had $15.0 billion of forward      \ncommitments to sell, hedging $6.8 billion of  \nMLHFS and $13.3 billion of unfunded mortgage  \nloan commitments. The forward commitments to  \nsell and the unfunded mortgage loan           \ncommitments on loans intended to be sold are  \nconsidered derivatives under the accounting   \nguidance related to accounting for derivative \ninstruments and hedging activities. The       \nCompany has elected the fair value option for \nthe MLHFS. Derivatives are subject to credit  \nrisk associated with counterparties to the    \ncontracts. Credit risk associated with        \nderivatives is measured by the Company based  \non the probability of counterparty default,   \nincluding consideration of the COVID-19       \npandemic. The Company manages the credit risk \nof its derivative positions by diversifying   \nits positions among various counterparties, by\nentering into master netting arrangements,    \nand, where possible, by requiring collateral  \narrangements. The Company may also transfer   \ncounterparty credit risk related to interest  \nrate swaps to third parties through the use of\nrisk participation agreements. In addition,   \ncertain interest rate swaps, interest rate    \nforwards and credit contracts are required to \nbe centrally cleared through clearinghouses to\nfurther mitigate counterparty credit risk. For\nadditional information on derivatives and     \nhedging activities, refer to Notes 12 and 13  \nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial        \nStatements. LIBOR Transition In July 2017, the\nUnited Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority  \nannounced that it would no longer require     \nbanks to submit rates for the London InterBank\nOffered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) after 2021. The Company\nholds financial instruments that will be      \nimpacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR,      \nincluding certain loans, investment           \nsecurities, derivatives, borrowings and other \nfinancial instruments that use LIBOR as the   \nbenchmark rate. The Company also provides     \nvarious services to customers in its capacity \nas trustee, which involve financial           \ninstruments that will be similarly impacted by\nthe discontinuance of LIBOR. The Company      \nanticipates these financial instruments will  \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    23  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nrequire transition to a new reference rate.   \nThis transition will occur over time as many  \nof these arrangements do not have an          \nalternative rate referenced in their contracts\nor a clear path for the parties to agree upon \nan alternative reference rate. In order to    \nfacilitate the transition process, the Company\nhas instituted a LIBOR Transition Office and  \ncommenced an enterprise-wide project to       \nidentify, assess and monitor risks associated \nwith the expected discontinuance or           \nunavailability of LIBOR, actively engage with \nindustry working groups and regulators,       \nachieve operational readiness and engage      \nimpacted customers. It is currently unclear   \nwhat impact COVID-19 may have on the LIBOR    \ntransition or on the timing thereof. Refer to \n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report \non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,  \n2019, for further discussion on potential     \nrisks that could adversely affect the         \nCompany\u2019s financial results as a result of the\nLIBOR transition. Market Risk Management In   \naddition to interest rate risk, the Company is\nexposed to other forms of market risk,        \nprincipally related to trading activities     \nwhich support customers\u2019 strategies to manage \ntheir own foreign currency, interest rate risk\nand funding activities. For purposes of its   \ninternal capital adequacy assessment process, \nthe Company considers risk arising from its   \ntrading activities, as well as the            \nremeasurement volatility of foreign currency  \ndenominated balances included on its          \nConsolidated Balance Sheet (collectively,     \n\u201cCovered Positions\u201d), employing methodologies \nconsistent with the requirements of regulatory\nrules for market risk. The Company\u2019s Market   \nRisk Committee (\u201cMRC\u201d), within the framework  \nof the ALCO, oversees market risk management. \nThe MRC monitors and reviews the Company\u2019s    \nCovered Positions and establishes policies for\nmarket risk management, including exposure    \nlimits for each portfolio. The Company uses a \nVaR approach to measure general market risk.  \nTheoretically, VaR represents the statistical \nrisk of loss the Company has to adverse market\nmovements over a one-day time horizon. The    \nCompany uses the Historical Simulation method \nto calculate VaR for its Covered Positions    \nmeasured at the ninety-ninth percentile using \na one-year look-back period for distributions \nderived from past market data. The market     \nfactors used in the calculations include those\npertinent to market risks inherent in the     \nunderlying trading portfolios, principally    \nthose that affect the Company\u2019s corporate bond\ntrading business, foreign currency transaction\nbusiness, client derivatives business, loan   \ntrading business and municipal securities     \nbusiness, as well as those inherent in the    \nCompany\u2019s foreign denominated balances and the\nderivatives used to mitigate the related      \nmeasurement volatility. On average, the       \nCompany expects the one-day VaR to be exceeded\nby actual losses two to three times per year  \nrelated to these positions. The Company       \nmonitors the accuracy of internal VaR models  \nand modeling processes by back-testing model  \nperformance, regularly updating the historical\ndata used by the VaR models and regular model \nvalidations to assess the accuracy of the     \nmodels\u2019 input, processing, and reporting      \ncomponents. All models are required to be     \nindependently reviewed and approved prior to  \nbeing placed in use. If the Company were to   \nexperience market losses in excess of the     \nestimated VaR more often than expected, the   \nVaR models and associated assumptions would be\nanalyzed and adjusted. The average, high, low \nand period-end one-day VaR amounts for the    \nCompany\u2019s Covered Positions were as follows:  \n                                              \n  Six Months Ended                            \n  June\u00a030                                     \n  (Dollars in                                 \n  Millions)                  2020       2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Average                 $     2    $     1  \n  High                          3          2  \n  Low                           1          1  \n  Period-end                    3          1  \n                                              \nGiven the market volatility resulting from    \neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company \nexperienced actual losses for its combined    \nCovered Positions that exceeded VaR five times\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2020. The\nCompany did not experience any actual losses  \nfor its combined Covered Positions that       \nexceeded VaR during the six months ended June \n30, 2019. The Company stress tests its market \nrisk measurements to provide management with  \nperspectives on market events that may not be \ncaptured by its VaR models, including worst   \ncase historical market movement combinations  \nthat have not necessarily occurred on the same\ndate. The Company calculates Stressed VaR     \nusing the same underlying methodology and     \nmodel as VaR, except that a historical        \ncontinuous one-year look-back period is       \nutilized that reflects a period of significant\nfinancial stress appropriate to the Company\u2019s \nCovered Positions.

The Company engages in various  \nactivities to manage its liquidity risk. These\nactivities include diversifying its funding   \nsources, stress testing, and holding readily- \nmarketable assets which can be used as a      \nsource of liquidity if needed. In addition,   \nthe Company\u2019s profitable operations, sound    \ncredit quality and strong capital position    \nhave enabled it to develop a large and        \nreliable base of core deposit funding within  \nits market areas and in domestic and global   \ncapital markets. During the six months ended  \nJune 30, 2020, the Company effectively managed\nits liquidity position while funding          \nsignificant loan growth during the period. The\nCompany\u2019s Board of Directors approves the     \nCompany\u2019s liquidity policy. The Risk          \nManagement Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of\nDirectors oversees the Company\u2019s liquidity    \nrisk management process and approves a        \ncontingency funding plan. The ALCO reviews the\nCompany\u2019s liquidity policy and limits, and    \nregularly assesses the Company\u2019s ability to   \nmeet funding requirements arising from adverse\ncompany-specific or market events. The Company\nregularly projects its funding needs under    \nvarious stress scenarios and maintains a      \ncontingency funding plan consistent with the  \nCompany\u2019s access to diversified sources of    \ncontingent funding. The Company maintains a   \nsubstantial level of total available liquidity\nin the form of on-balance sheet and off-      \nbalance sheet funding sources. These liquidity\nsources include cash at the Federal Reserve   \nBank and certain European central banks,      \nunencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to   \nborrow from the FHLB and at Federal Reserve   \nBank\u2019s Discount Window. At June 30, 2020, the \nfair value of unencumbered investment         \nsecurities totaled $116.3 billion, compared   \nwith $114.2 billion at December 31, 2019.     \nRefer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated  \nFinancial Statements and \u201cBalance Sheet       \nAnalysis\u201d for further information on          \ninvestment securities maturities and trends.  \nAsset liquidity is further enhanced by the    \nCompany\u2019s practice of pledging loans to access\nsecured borrowing facilities through the FHLB \nand Federal Reserve Bank. At June 30, 2020,   \nthe Company could have borrowed a total of an \nadditional $97.8 billion from the FHLB and    \nFederal Reserve Bank based on collateral      \navailable for additional borrowings. The      \nCompany\u2019s diversified deposit base provides a \nsizeable source of relatively stable and low- \ncost funding, while reducing the Company\u2019s    \nreliance on the wholesale markets. Total      \ndeposits were $413.3 billion at June 30, 2020,\ncompared with $361.9 billion at December 31,  \n2019. Refer to \u201cBalance Sheet Analysis\u201d for   \nfurther information on the Company\u2019s deposits.\nAdditional funding is provided by long-term   \ndebt and short-term borrowings. Long-term debt\nwas $42.6 billion at June 30, 2020, and is an \nimportant funding source because of its multi-\nyear borrowing structure. Short-term          \nborrowings were $20.6 billion at June 30,     \n2020, and supplement the Company\u2019s other      \nfunding sources. Refer to \u201cBalance Sheet      \nAnalysis\u201d for further information on the      \nCompany\u2019s long-term debt and short-term       \nborrowings. In addition to assessing liquidity\nrisk on a consolidated basis, the Company     \nmonitors the parent company\u2019s liquidity. The  \nCompany establishes limits for the minimal    \nnumber of months into the future where the    \nparent company can meet existing and          \nforecasted obligations with cash and          \nsecurities held that can be readily monetized.\nThe Company measures and manages this limit in\nboth normal and adverse conditions. The       \nCompany maintains sufficient                  \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    25  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nfunding to meet expected capital and debt     \nservice obligations for 24 months without the \nsupport of dividends from subsidiaries and    \nassuming access to the wholesale markets is   \nmaintained. The Company maintains sufficient  \nliquidity to meet its capital and debt service\nobligations for 12 months under adverse       \nconditions without the support of dividends   \nfrom subsidiaries or access to the wholesale  \nmarkets. The parent company is currently well \nin excess of required liquidity minimums. At  \nJune 30, 2020, parent company long-term debt  \noutstanding was $20.9 billion, compared with  \n$18.6 billion at December 31, 2019. The       \nincrease was primarily due to $1.5 billion of \nmedium-term note issuances. As of June 30,    \n2020, there was no parent company debt        \nscheduled to mature in the remainder of 2020. \nThe Company is subject to a regulatory        \nLiquidity Coverage Ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d) requirement  \nwhich requires banks to maintain an adequate  \nlevel of unencumbered high quality liquid     \nassets to meet estimated liquidity needs over \na 30-day stressed period. At June 30, 2020,   \nthe Company was compliant with this           \nrequirement. Refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion\nand Analysis \u2014 Liquidity Risk Management\u201d in  \nthe Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for  \nthe year ended December 31, 2019, for further \ndiscussion on liquidity risk management.      \nEuropean Exposures The Company provides       \nmerchant processing and corporate trust       \nservices in Europe either directly or through \nbanking affiliations in Europe. Revenue       \ngenerated from sources in Europe represented  \napproximately 1 percent of the Company\u2019s total\nnet revenue for both the three and six months \nended June 30, 2020. Operating cash for these \nbusinesses is deposited on a short-term basis \ntypically with certain European central banks.\nFor deposits placed at other European banks,  \nexposure is mitigated by the Company placing  \ndeposits at multiple banks and managing the   \namounts on deposit at any bank based on       \ninstitution-specific deposit limits. At June  \n30, 2020, the Company had an aggregate amount \non deposit with European banks of             \napproximately $9.1 billion, predominately with\nthe Central Bank of Ireland and Bank of       \nEngland. In addition, the Company provides    \nfinancing to domestic multinational           \ncorporations that generate revenue from       \ncustomers in European countries, transacts    \nwith various European banks as counterparties \nto certain derivative-related activities, and \nthrough a subsidiary, manages money market    \nfunds that hold certain investments in        \nEuropean sovereign debt. Any further          \ndeterioration in economic conditions in       \nEurope, including the potential negative      \nimpact of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from\nthe European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d), is not expected\nto have a significant effect on the Company   \nrelated to these activities. The Company is   \nfocused on providing continuity of services,  \nwith minimal disruption resulting from Brexit,\nto customers with activities in European      \ncountries. The Company has made certain       \nstructural changes to its legal entities and  \noperations in the United Kingdom and European \nUnion, where needed, and migrated certain     \nbusiness activities to the appropriate        \njurisdictions to continue to provide such     \nservices and generate revenue. Off-Balance    \nSheet Arrangements Off-balance sheet          \narrangements include any contractual          \narrangements to which an unconsolidated entity\nis a party, under which the Company has an    \nobligation to provide credit or liquidity     \nenhancements or market risk support. In the   \nordinary course of business, the Company      \nenters into an array of commitments to extend \ncredit, letters of credit and various forms of\nguarantees that may be considered off-balance \nsheet arrangements. Refer to Note 15 of the   \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements for\nfurther information on these arrangements. The\nCompany does not utilize private label asset  \nsecuritizations as a source of funding. Off-  \nbalance sheet arrangements also include any   \nobligation related to a variable interest held\nin an unconsolidated entity that provides     \nfinancing, liquidity, credit enhancement or   \nmarket risk support. Refer to Note 5 of the   \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements for\nfurther information related to the Company\u2019s  \ninterests in variable interest entities.      \nCapital Management The Company is committed to\nmanaging capital to maintain strong protection\nfor depositors and creditors and for maximum  \nshareholder benefit. The Company also manages \nits capital to exceed regulatory capital      \nrequirements for banking organizations. The   \nregulatory capital requirements effective for \nthe Company follow Basel III, with the Company\nbeing subject to calculating its capital      \nadequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted     \nassets under the standardized approach. During\n2020, the Company elected to adopt an interim \nfinal rule issued in March 2020 by its        \nregulators which permits banking organizations\nwho adopt accounting guidance related to the  \nimpairment of financial instruments based on  \nthe current expected credit losses methodology\nduring 2020, the option to defer the impact of\nthe effect of that guidance at adoption plus  \n25 percent of its quarterly credit reserve    \nincreases over the next two years on its      \nregulatory capital requirements, followed by a\nthree-year transition period to phase in the  \ncumulative deferred impact.

At June 30, 2020, the Company\u2019s     \ntangible common equity, as a percent of       \ntangible assets and as a percent of risk-     \nweighted assets determined in accordance with \ntransitional regulatory capital requirements  \nrelated to the current expected credit losses \nmethodology under the standardized approach,  \nwas 6.7 percent and 9.0 percent, respectively.\nThis compares to the Company\u2019s tangible common\nequity, as a percent of tangible assets and as\na percent of risk-weighted assets under the   \nstandardized approach, of 7.5 percent and 9.3 \npercent, respectively, at December 31, 2019.  \nIn addition, the Company\u2019s common equity tier \n1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio,      \nreflecting the full implementation of the     \ncurrent expected credit losses methodology was\n8.7 percent at June 30, 2020. Refer to \u201cNon-  \nGAAP Financial Measures\u201d beginning on page 32 \nfor further information on these other capital\nratios. Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders\u2019      \nequity was $51.9 billion at June 30, 2020,    \nunchanged from December 31, 2019, resulting   \nfrom a reduction to retained earnings due to  \nthe January 1, 2020 adoption of accounting    \nguidance related to the impairment of         \nfinancial instruments, common share           \nrepurchases and dividends, offset by changes  \nin unrealized gains and losses on available-  \nfor-sale investment securities included in    \nother comprehensive income (loss) and         \ncorporate earnings. During 2019, the Company  \nannounced its Board of Directors had approved \nauthorizations to repurchase up to $5.5       \nbillion of its common stock, from July 1, 2019\nthrough June 30, 2020. Beginning in March     \n2020, the Company suspended all common stock  \nrepurchases except for those done exclusively \nin connection with its stock-based            \ncompensation programs, to maintain strong     \ncapital levels given the impact and           \nuncertainties of COVID-19 on the economy and  \nglobal markets. In addition, the Federal      \nReserve announced in June 2020 that it will   \nrequire all large bank holding companies to   \npreserve capital during the third quarter of  \n2020 through the suspension of share          \nrepurchase programs and capping dividends at  \nexisting rates, which may not be in excess of \nthe average of the last four quarters\u2019        \nearnings, due to the continued economic       \nuncertainty resulting from COVID-19. The      \nCompany will continue to monitor the impact of\nCOVID-19 and will adjust its capital          \ndistributions as circumstances warrant.       \nAdditional capital distributions are subject  \nto the approval of the Company\u2019s Board of     \nDirectors, and will be consistent with        \nregulatory requirements.

The increases were primarily due to     \nstrong loan growth as well as higher          \nnoninterest-bearing and interest-bearing      \ndeposits, partially offset by the impact on   \nnet interest margin due to changes in loan mix\nand lower spreads on loans, reflecting        \nchanging interest rates given the economic    \nenvironment. Noninterest income increased $96 \nmillion (39.3 percent) in the second quarter  \nand $161 million (35.6 percent) in the first  \nsix months of 2020, compared with the same    \nperiods of 2019, primarily due to higher      \ncapital markets and trading revenue as        \ncorporate customers accessed the fixed income \ncapital markets for bond issuances.           \nNoninterest expense decreased $3 million (0.7 \npercent) in the second quarter and increased  \n$10 million (1.2 percent) in the first six    \nmonths of 2020, compared with the same periods\nof 2019, reflecting lower net shared services \nexpense, lower other noninterest expense due  \nto a reduction in travel as a result of       \nCOVID-19, and lower loan costs, offset by     \nhigher variable compensation related to fixed \nincome capital markets business production.   \nThe provision for credit losses increased $37 \nmillion in the second quarter of 2020,        \ncompared with the second quarter of 2019,     \nprimarily due to higher net charge-offs,      \npartially offset by a favorable change in the \nreserve allocation driven by payoffs of funded\nexposures net of the impact of credit risk    \nrating downgrades. The provision for credit   \nlosses increased $439 million in the first six\nmonths of 2020, compared with the first six   \nmonths of 2019, primarily due to an           \nunfavorable change in the reserve allocation  \nbased on economic risks related to COVID-19 in\nthe portfolio, along with higher net charge-  \noffs.

The   \ndecreases were primarily due to the impact of \ndeclining interest rates on the margin benefit\nfrom deposits, partially offset by growth in  \nnon-interest bearing and interest-bearing     \ndeposit balances and loan growth driven in    \npart by loans made under the SBA\u2019s Paycheck   \nProtection Program. Noninterest income        \nincreased $354 million (62.4 percent) in the  \nsecond                                        \n                      \n  28    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nquarter and $576 million (52.3 percent) in the\nfirst six months of 2020, compared with the   \nsame periods of 2019, primarily due to higher \nmortgage banking revenue driven by mortgage   \nproduction and related gain on sale margins,  \npartially offset by changes in the valuation  \nof MSRs, net of hedging activities.

Noninterest   \nexpense increased $64 million (4.9 percent) in\nthe second quarter and $127 million (5.0      \npercent) in the first six months of 2020,     \ncompared with the same periods of 2019,       \nprimarily due to higher variable compensation \nrelated to strong mortgage banking origination\nactivities, and higher net shared services    \nexpense, reflecting the impact of investment  \nin infrastructure supporting business growth. \nThe provision for credit losses increased $31 \nmillion (39.2 percent) in the second quarter  \nand $84 million (56.4 percent) in the first   \nsix months of 2020, compared with the same    \nperiods of 2019, due to higher net charge-offs\nand unfavorable changes in the reserve        \nallocation reflecting deterioration in credit \nquality given the economic environment.

The provision  \nfor credit losses decreased $326 million in   \nthe second quarter and $350 million (60.2     \npercent) in the first six months of 2020,     \ncompared with the same periods of 2019,       \nreflecting favorable changes in the reserve   \nallocation driven by lower outstanding loan   \nbalances and lower delinquency rates,         \npartially offset by higher net charge-offs.   \nTreasury and Corporate Support Treasury and   \nCorporate Support includes the Company\u2019s      \ninvestment portfolios, funding, capital       \nmanagement, interest rate risk management,    \nincome taxes not allocated to the business    \nlines, including most investments in tax-     \nadvantaged projects, and the residual         \naggregate of those expenses associated with   \ncorporate activities that are managed on a    \nconsolidated basis. Treasury and Corporate    \nSupport recorded net losses of $1.2 billion in\nthe second quarter and $1.4 billion in the    \nfirst six months of 2020, compared with net   \nincome of $186 million and $316 million,      \nrespectively, in the same periods of 2019. Net\nrevenue decreased $131 million (37.1 percent) \nin the second quarter and $203 million (32.0  \npercent) in the first six months of 2020,     \ncompared with the same periods of 2019. Net   \ninterest income, on a taxable-equivalent      \nbasis, decreased $81 million in the second    \nquarter and $126 million in the first six     \nmonths of 2020, compared with the same periods\nof 2019, primarily due to lower spreads within\nthe investment portfolio. Noninterest income  \ndecreased $50 million (17.7 percent) in the   \nsecond quarter and $77 million (14.1 percent) \nin the first six months of 2020, compared with\nthe same periods of 2019, primarily due to    \nlower equity investment income, lower tax-    \nadvantaged investment syndication revenue, and\nasset impairments as a result of property     \ndamage from civil unrest in the second quarter\nof 2020, partially offset by higher investment\nsecurities gains. The decrease in noninterest \nincome in the first six months of 2020,       \ncompared with the first six months of 2019,   \nwas also due to higher credit valuation       \nlosses, partially offset by gains on the sale \nof certain businesses in the first quarter of \n2020. Noninterest expense increased $102      \nmillion (45.5 percent) in the second quarter  \nand $221 million (45.6 percent) in the first  \nsix months of 2020, compared with the same    \nperiods of 2019, primarily due to COVID-      \nrelated expenses, higher state franchise      \ntaxes, higher compensation expense reflecting \nmerit increases and stock-based compensation, \nand higher implementation costs of capital    \ninvestments to support business growth. These \nincreases were partially offset by lower net  \nshared services expense, lower costs related  \nto tax-advantaged projects and a reduction in \ntravel expenses as a result of COVID-19. The  \nprovision for credit losses increased $1.6    \nbillion in the second quarter and $1.8 billion\nin the first six months of 2020, compared with\nthe same periods of 2019, reflecting          \nunfavorable changes in the reserve allocation \ndue to adverse changes in economic conditions \nand the expected impact to credit losses in   \nthe current environment. Income taxes are     \nassessed to each line of business at a        \nmanagerial tax rate of 25.0 percent with the  \nresidual tax expense or benefit to arrive at  \nthe consolidated effective tax rate included  \nin Treasury and Corporate Support. NON-GAAP   \nFINANCIAL MEASURES In addition to capital     \nratios defined by banking regulators, the     \nCompany considers various other measures when \nevaluating capital utilization and adequacy,  \nincluding:                                    \n                                              \n  \u2022    Tangible common equity to tangible     \n       assets,                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Tangible common equity to              \n       risk-weighted assets, and              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Common equity tier\u00a01 capital to        \n  \u2022    risk-weighted assets, reflecting the   \n       full implementation of the current     \n       expected credit losses methodology.    \n                                              \nThese capital measures are viewed by          \nmanagement as useful additional methods of    \nevaluating the Company\u2019s utilization of its   \ncapital held and the level of capital         \navailable to withstand unexpected negative    \nmarket or economic conditions. Additionally,  \npresentation of these measures allows         \ninvestors, analysts and banking regulators to \nassess the Company\u2019s capital position relative\nto other financial services companies. These  \ncapital measures are not defined in generally \naccepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), or   \nare not currently effective or defined in     \nbanking regulations. In addition, certain of  \nthese measures differ from currently effective\ncapital ratios defined by banking regulations \nprincipally in that the currently effective   \nratios, which are subject to certain          \ntransitional provisions, temporarily exclude  \nthe impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting \nguidance related to impairment of financial   \ninstruments based on the current expected     \ncredit losses methodology. As a result, these \ncapital measures disclosed by the Company may \nbe considered non-GAAP financial measures.    \nManagement believes this information helps    \ninvestors assess trends in the Company\u2019s      \ncapital adequacy. The Company also discloses  \nnet interest income and related ratios and    \nanalysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which \nmay also be considered non-GAAP financial     \nmeasures. The Company believes this           \npresentation to be the preferred industry     \nmeasurement of net interest income as it      \nprovides a relevant comparison of net interest\nincome arising from taxable and tax-exempt    \nsources. In addition, certain performance     \nmeasures, including the efficiency ratio and  \nnet interest margin utilize net interest      \nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis. There   \nmay be limits in the usefulness of these      \nmeasures to investors. As a result, the       \nCompany encourages readers to consider the    \nconsolidated financial statements and other   \nfinancial information contained in this report\nin their entirety, and not to rely on any     \nsingle financial measure.                     \n                      \n  32    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table

accounting   \nand reporting policies of the Company comply  \nwith accounting principles generally accepted \nin the United States and conform to general   \npractices within the banking industry. The    \npreparation of financial statements in        \nconformity with GAAP requires management to   \nmake estimates and assumptions. The Company\u2019s \nfinancial position and results of operations  \ncan be affected by these estimates and        \nassumptions, which are integral to            \nunderstanding the Company\u2019s financial         \nstatements. Critical accounting policies are  \nthose policies management believes are the    \nmost important to the portrayal of the        \nCompany\u2019s financial condition and results, and\nrequire management to make estimates that are \ndifficult, subjective or complex. Most        \naccounting policies are not considered by     \nmanagement to be critical accounting policies.\nManagement has discussed the development and  \nthe selection of critical accounting policies \nwith the Company\u2019s Audit Committee. Those     \npolicies considered to be critical accounting \npolicies relate to the allowance for credit   \nlosses, fair value estimates, MSRs, and income\ntaxes. Allowance for Credit Losses            \nManagement\u2019s evaluation of the appropriate    \nallowance for credit losses is often the most \ncritical of all the accounting estimates for a\nbanking institution. It is an inherently      \nsubjective process impacted by many factors as\ndiscussed throughout the Management\u2019s         \nDiscussion and Analysis section of this       \nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Prior to       \nJanuary 1, 2020, the allowance for credit     \nlosses was established to provide for probable\nand estimable losses incurred in the Company\u2019s\ncredit portfolio. Effective January 1, 2020,  \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    33  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nthe Company adopted new accounting guidance   \nwhich changed previous impairment recognition \nto a model that is based on expected losses   \nrather than incurred losses. Refer to Note 2  \nof the Notes to Consolidated Financial        \nStatements for discussion on the effect of the\nadoption of this guidance on the Company\u2019s    \nfinancial statements. The methods utilized to \nestimate the allowance for credit losses, key \nassumptions and quantitative and qualitative  \ninformation considered by management in       \ndetermining the appropriate allowance for     \ncredit losses at June 30, 2020 are discussed  \nin the \u201cCredit Risk Management\u201d section.      \nAlthough methodologies utilized to determine  \neach element of the allowance reflect         \nmanagement\u2019s assessment of credit risk as     \nidentified through assessments completed of   \nindividual credits and of homogenous pools    \naffected by material credit events, degrees of\nimprecision exist in these measurement tools  \ndue in part to subjective judgments involved  \nand an inherent lag in the data available to  \nquantify current conditions and events that   \naffect credit loss reserve estimates. As      \ndiscussed in the \u201cAnalysis and Determination  \nof Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d section,      \nmanagement considered the effect of changes in\neconomic conditions, risk management          \npractices, and other factors that contributed \nto imprecision of loss estimates in           \ndetermining the allowance for credit losses.  \nIf not considered, expected losses in the     \ncredit portfolio related to imprecision and   \nother subjective factors could have a dramatic\nadverse impact on the liquidity and financial \nviability of a banking institution. Given the \nmany quantitative variables and subjective    \nfactors affecting the credit portfolio,       \nchanges in the allowance for credit losses may\nnot directly coincide with changes in the risk\nratings of the credit portfolio reflected in  \nthe risk rating process. This is in part due  \nto the timing of the risk rating process in   \nrelation to changes in the business cycle, the\nexposure and mix of loans within risk rating  \ncategories, levels of nonperforming loans and \nthe timing of charge-offs and expected        \nrecoveries. The allowance for credit losses on\ncommercial lending segment loans measures the \nexpected loss content on the remaining        \nportfolio exposure, while nonperforming loans \nand net charge-offs are measures of specific  \nimpairment events that have already been      \nconfirmed. Therefore, the degree of change in \nthe forward-looking expected loss in the      \ncommercial lending allowance may differ from  \nthe level of changes in nonperforming loans   \nand net charge-offs. Management maintains an  \nappropriate allowance for credit losses by    \nupdating allowance rates to reflect changes in\nexpected losses, including expected changes in\neconomic or business cycle conditions. Some   \nfactors considered in determining the         \nappropriate allowance for credit losses are   \nmore readily quantifiable while other factors \nrequire extensive qualitative judgment.       \nManagement conducts an analysis with respect  \nto the accuracy of risk ratings and the       \nvolatility of expected losses, and utilizes   \nthis analysis along with qualitative factors  \nthat can affect the precision of credit loss  \nestimates, including economic conditions, such\nas changes in Gross Domestic Product,         \nunemployment or bankruptcy rates, and         \nconcentration risks, such as risks associated \nwith specific industries, collateral          \nvaluations, and loans to highly leveraged     \nenterprises, in determining the overall level \nof the allowance for credit losses. The       \nCompany considers a range of economic         \nscenarios in its determination of the         \nallowance for credit losses. These scenarios  \nare constructed with interrelated projections \nof multiple economic variables, and loss      \nestimates are produced that consider the      \nhistorical correlation of those economic      \nvariables with credit losses, and also the    \nexpectation that conditions will eventually   \nnormalize over the longer run. Scenarios worse\nthan the Company\u2019s expected outcome at June   \n30, 2020 include risks that government        \nstimulus in response to the COVID-19 pandemic \nis less broad or less effective than expected,\nor that a longer or more severe health crisis \nprolongs the downturn in economic activity,   \nreducing the number of businesses that are    \nultimately able to resume operations after the\ncrisis has passed. The Company\u2019s determination\nof the allowance for commercial lending       \nsegment loans is sensitive to the assigned    \ncredit risk ratings and expected loss rates at\nJune 30, 2020. If 20 percent of period ending \nloan balances (including unfunded commitments)\nwithin each risk category of risk rated       \ncommercial lending loans experienced a        \ndowngrade to the next worse risk category, the\nallowance for credit losses would have        \nincreased by approximately $238 million at    \nJune 30, 2020. If quantitative loss estimates \nfor commercial lending segment loans increased\nby 10 percent, the allowance for credit losses\nwould have increased by approximately $358    \nmillion at June 30, 2020. The Company believes\nthe allowance for credit losses appropriately \nconsiders the imprecision in estimating credit\nlosses based on credit risk ratings and credit\nloss model estimates, but actual losses may   \ndiffer from those estimates. The Company\u2019s    \ndetermination of the allowance for consumer   \nlending segment loans is sensitive to changes \nin estimated loss rates and estimated         \nimpairments on restructured loans. In the     \nevent that estimated losses for this segment  \nof the loan portfolio increased by 10 percent,\nthe allowance for credit losses would have    \nincreased by approximately $324 million at    \nJune 30, 2020. Because several quantitative   \nand qualitative factors are considered in     \ndetermining the allowance for credit          \n                      \n  34    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nlosses, these sensitivity analyses do not     \nnecessarily reflect the nature and extent of  \nfuture changes in the allowance for credit    \nlosses. They are intended to provide insights \ninto the impact of adverse changes in risk    \nrating and loss model estimates and do not    \nimply any expectation of future deterioration \nin the risk rating or loss rates. Given       \ncurrent processes employed by the Company,    \nmanagement believes the risk ratings and loss \nmodel estimates currently assigned are        \nappropriate. It is possible that others, given\nthe same information, may at any point in time\nreach different reasonable conclusions that   \ncould be significant to the Company\u2019s         \nfinancial statements.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    \nUnder the supervision and with the            \nparticipation of the Company\u2019s management,    \nincluding its principal executive officer and \nprincipal financial officer, the Company has  \nevaluated the effectiveness of the design and \noperation of its disclosure controls and      \nprocedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and \n15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)). Based upon this   \nevaluation, the principal executive officer   \nand principal financial officer have concluded\nthat, as of the end of the period covered by  \nthis report, the Company\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures were effective. During the most\nrecently completed fiscal quarter, there was  \nno change made in the Company\u2019s internal      \ncontrol over financial reporting (as defined  \nin Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the    \nExchange Act) that has materially affected, or\nis reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial     \nreporting.

In the opinion of          \nmanagement of U.S.\u00a0Bancorp (the \u201cCompany\u201d),   \nall adjustments (consisting only of normal    \nrecurring adjustments) necessary for a fair   \nstatement of results for the interim periods  \nhave been made.

Certain amounts in prior periods have   \nbeen reclassified to conform to the current   \npresentation.                                 \n                                \n  Note\u00a02    Accounting Changes  \n                                \nFinancial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses Effective \nJanuary 1, 2020, the Company adopted          \naccounting guidance, issued by the Financial  \nAccounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) in June   \n2016, related to the impairment of financial  \ninstruments. This guidance changes impairment \nrecognition to a model that is based on       \nexpected losses rather than incurred losses,  \nwhich is intended to result in more timely    \nrecognition of credit losses. This guidance is\nalso intended to reduce the complexity of     \naccounting guidance by decreasing the number  \nof credit impairment models that entities use \nto account for debt instruments. In addition, \nthe guidance requires additional credit       \nquality disclosures for loans. Upon adoption, \nthe Company increased its allowance for credit\nlosses by approximately $ 1.5billion and      \nreduced retained earnings net of deferred tax \nbalances by approximately $ 1.1billion through\na cumulative-effect adjustment. The Company   \nhas elected to defer the impact of the effect \nof the guidance at adoption plus 25 percent of\nits quarterly credit reserve increases over   \nthe next two years on its regulatory capital  \nrequirements, followed by a transition period \nto phase in the cumulative deferred impact at \n25 percent per year from 2022 to 2025, as     \nprovided by rules issued by its regulators.   \nWhen determining expected losses, the Company \nuses multiple economic scenarios and a three- \nyear reasonable and supportable forecast      \nperiod, which incorporates historical loss    \nexperience in years two and three. After the  \nforecast period, the Company fully reverts to \nlong-term historical loss experience, adjusted\nfor prepayments and characteristics of the    \ncurrent loan and lease portfolio, to estimate \nlosses over the remaining lives of the        \nfinancial instruments.                        \nThe increase in the allowance at adoption was \nprimarily related to the commercial, credit   \ncard, installment and other retail loan       \nportfolios where the allowance for loan losses\nhad not previously considered the full term of\nthe loans. The Company also recognized an     \nadditional $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.9 billion    \nincrease in its allowance for credit losses   \nduring the second quarter and first six months\nof 2020, respectively, utilizing this         \nguidance. These increases reflected           \ndeteriorating economic conditions driven by   \nthe impact of COVID-19 on the domestic and    \nglobal economies. Expected loss estimates     \nconsidered both the decrease in economic      \nactivity, and the mitigating effects of       \ngovernment stimulus and industrywide loan     \nmodification efforts designed to limit long   \nterm effects of the pandemic event. The       \nincreases in the allowance for credit losses  \nresulted from the estimated impact of         \ndeteriorating economic conditions and higher  \nunemployment, partially offset by the benefits\nof government stimulus programs.              \nThe adoption of this guidance did not have a  \nmaterial impact on the Company\u2019s available-   \nfor-sale securities as most of this portfolio \nconsists of U.S. Treasury and residential     \nagency mortgage-backed securities that        \ninherently have an immaterial risk of loss.   \nReference Interest Rate Transition In March   \n2020, the FASB issued accounting guidance,    \nproviding temporary optional expedients and   \nexceptions to the guidance in United States   \ngenerally accepted accounting principles on   \ncontract modifications and hedge accounting,  \nto ease the financial reporting burdens       \nrelated to the expected market transition from\nthe London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d)   \nand other interbank offered rates to          \nalternative reference rates. Under the        \nguidance, a company can elect not to apply    \ncertain modification accounting requirements  \nto contracts affected by reference rate       \ntransition, if certain criteria are met. A    \ncompany that makes this election would not    \nhave to remeasure the contracts at the        \nmodification date or reassess a previous      \naccounting determination. This guidance also  \npermits a company to elect various optional   \nexpedients that would allow it to continue    \napplying hedge accounting for hedging         \nrelationships affected by reference rate      \ntransition, if certain criteria are met. The  \nguidance is effective upon issuance and       \ngenerally can be applied through December 31, \n2022.

If the Company    \nintends to sell or it is more likely than not \nthe Company will be required to sell an       \ninvestment security, the amortized cost of the\nsecurity is written down to fair value. When  \nevaluating credit losses, the Company         \nconsiders various factors such as the nature  \nof the investment security, the credit ratings\nor financial condition of the issuer, the     \nextent of the unrealized loss, expected cash  \nflows of underlying collateral, the existence \nof any government or agency guarantees, and   \nmarket conditions. The Company measures the   \nallowance for credit losses using market      \ninformation where available and discounting   \nthe cash flows at the original effective rate \nof the investment security. The allowance for \ncredit losses is adjusted each period through \nearnings and can be subsequently recovered.   \nThe allowance for credit losses on the        \nCompany\u2019s available-for-sale investment       \nsecurities was immaterial at June\u00a030, 2020.   \n                      \n  42    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nAt June\u00a030, 2020, certain investment          \nsecurities had a fair value below amortized   \ncost.

Net unearned interest   \nand deferred fees and costs amounted to $ 922 \nmillion at June\u00a030, 2020 and $ 781 million at \nDecember\u00a031, 2019. All purchased loans are    \nrecorded at fair value at the date of         \npurchase. Beginning January\u00a01, 2020, the      \nCompany evaluates purchased loans for more-   \nthan-insignificant deterioration at the date  \nof purchase in accordance with applicable     \nauthoritative accounting guidance. Purchased  \nloans that have experienced more-than-        \ninsignificant deterioration from origination  \nare considered purchased credit deteriorated  \n(\u201cPCD\u201d) loans. All other purchased loans are  \nconsidered non-purchased credit deteriorated  \nloans.                                        \nThe Company offers a broad array of lending   \nproducts and categorizes its loan portfolio   \ninto two segments, which is the level at which\nit develops and documents a systematic        \nmethodology to determine the allowance for    \ncredit losses. The Company\u2019s two loan         \nportfolio segments are commercial lending and \nconsumer lending.                             \nAllowance for Credit Losses Effective January \n1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses is   \nestablished for current expected credit losses\non the Company\u2019s loan and lease portfolio,    \nincluding unfunded credit commitments. Prior  \nto January 1, 2020, the allowance for credit  \nlosses was established based on an incurred   \nloss model. The allowance for credit losses is\nincreased through provisions charged to       \nearnings and reduced by net charge-offs.      \nManagement evaluates the appropriateness of   \nthe allowance for credit losses on a quarterly\nbasis. The allowance considers expected losses\nfor the remaining lives of the applicable     \nassets, inclusive of expected recoveries.     \nMultiple economic scenarios are considered    \nover a three-year reasonable and supportable  \nforecast period, which incorporates historical\nloss experience in years two and three. After \nthe forecast period, the Company fully reverts\nto long-term historical loss experience,      \nadjusted for prepayments and characteristics  \nof the current loan and lease portfolio, to   \nestimate losses over the remaining lives. The \neconomic scenarios are updated at least       \nquarterly and are designed to provide a range \nof reasonable estimates, both better and worse\nthan current expectations. Scenarios are      \nweighted based on the Company\u2019s expectation of\nfuture conditions. Final loss estimates also  \nconsider factors affecting credit losses not  \nreflected in the scenarios, due to the unique \naspects of current conditions and             \nexpectations. These factors may include loan  \nservicing practices, regulatory guidance,     \nand/or fiscal and monetary policy actions.    \nThe allowance recorded for credit losses      \nutilizes forward-looking expected loss models \nto consider a variety of factors affecting    \nlifetime credit losses. These factors include \nloan and borrower characteristics, such as    \ninternal risk                                 \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    45  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nratings on commercial loans and consumer      \ncredit scores, delinquency status, collateral \ntype and available valuation information,     \nconsideration of end-of-termlosses on lease   \nresiduals, and the remaining term of the loan,\nadjusted for expected prepayments. Where loans\ndo not exhibit similar risk characteristics,  \nan individual analysis is performed to        \nconsider expected credit losses. For each loan\nportfolio, model estimates are adjusted as    \nnecessary to consider any relevant changes in \nportfolio composition, lending policies,      \nunderwriting standards, risk management       \npractices or economic conditions that would   \naffect the accuracy of the model. The results \nof the analysis are evaluated quarterly to    \nconfirm the estimates are appropriate for each\nloan portfolio. Expected credit loss estimates\nalso include consideration of expected cash   \nrecoveries on loans previously charged-off,or \nexpected recoveries on collateral dependent   \nloans where recovery is expected through sale \nof the collateral. The allowance recorded for \nindividually evaluated loans greater than $5  \nmillion in the commercial lending segment is  \nbased on an analysis utilizing expected cash  \nflows discounted using the original effective \ninterest rate, the observable market price of \nthe loan, or the fair value of the collateral,\nless selling costs, for collateral-dependent  \nloans. The allowance recorded for Troubled    \nDebt Restructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d) loans in the       \nconsumer lending segment is determined on a   \nhomogenous pool basis utilizing expected cash \nflows discounted using the original effective \ninterest rate of the pool. TDRs do not include\nloan modifications granted to customers       \nresulting directly from the economic effects  \nof the COVID-19pandemic. The expected cash    \nflows on TDR loans consider subsequent payment\ndefaults since modification, the borrower\u2019s   \nability to pay under the restructured terms,  \nand the timing and amount of payments. The    \nallowance for collateral-dependent loans in   \nthe consumer lending segment is determined    \nbased on the current fair value of the        \ncollateral less costs to sell. With respect to\nthe commercial lending segment, TDRs may be   \ncollectively evaluated for impairment where   \nobserved performance history, including       \ndefaults, is a primary driver of the loss     \nallocation. For commercial TDRs individually  \nevaluated for impairment, attributes of the   \nborrower are the primary factors in           \ndetermining the allowance for credit losses.  \nHowever, historical loss experience is also   \nincorporated into the allowance methodology   \napplied to this category of loans. Beginning  \nJanuary 1, 2020, when a loan portfolio is     \npurchased, an allowance is established for    \nthose loans considered purchased with more-   \nthan-insignificant credit deterioration, or   \nPCD loans, and those not considered purchased \nwith more-than-insignificant credit           \ndeterioration. The allowance established for  \neach population considers product mix, risk   \ncharacteristics of the portfolio, bankruptcy  \nexperience, delinquency status, refreshed     \nloan-to-valueratios when possible, and        \nportfolio growth. The allowance established   \nfor purchased loans not considered PCD is     \nrecognized through provision expense upon     \nacquisition, whereas the allowance established\nfor loans considered PCD at acquisition is    \noffset by an increase in the basis of the     \nacquired loans. Any subsequent increases and  \ndecreases in the allowance related to         \npurchased loans are recognized through        \nprovision expense, with future charge-offs    \ncharged to the allowance. The Company\u2019s       \nmethodology for determining the appropriate   \nallowance for credit losses for each loan     \nsegment also considers the imprecision        \ninherent in the methodologies used. As a      \nresult, amounts determined under the          \nmethodologies described above are adjusted by \nmanagement to consider the potential impact of\nother qualitative factors which include, but  \nare not limited to, the following: model      \nimprecision, imprecision in economic scenario \nassumptions, and emerging risks related to    \neither changes in the environment that are    \naffecting specific portfolio segments, or     \nchanges in portfolio concentrations over time \nthat may affect model performance. The        \nconsideration of these items results in       \nadjustments to allowance amounts included in  \nthe Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses     \nspecific to each portfolio class. The Company \nalso assesses the credit risk associated with \noff-balancesheet loan commitments, letters of \ncredit, investment securities and derivatives.\nCredit risk associated with derivatives is    \nreflected in the fair values recorded for     \nthose positions. The liability for off-       \nbalancesheet credit exposure related to loan  \ncommitments and other credit guarantees is    \nincluded in other liabilities. Because        \nbusiness processes and credit risks associated\nwith unfunded credit commitments are          \nessentially the same as for loans, the Company\nutilizes similar processes to estimate its    \nliability for unfunded credit commitments.    \n                      \n  46    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nActivity in the allowance for credit losses by\nportfolio class was as follows:               \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Effective January\u00a01, 2020, the         \n       Company adopted accounting guidance    \n       which changed impairment recognition   \n       of financial instruments to a model    \n       that is based on expected losses       \n  (a)  rather than incurred losses.           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nThe increase in the allowance for credit      \nlosses from December\u00a031, 2019 to June\u00a030, 2020\nreflected the adoption of new accounting      \nguidance and deteriorating economic conditions\ndriven by the impact of COVID-19 on the       \ndomestic and global economies. Expected loss  \nestimates consider both the decrease in       \neconomic activity, and the mitigating effects \nof government stimulus and industrywide loan  \nmodification efforts designed to limit long   \nterm effects of the pandemic. The increase in \nthe allowance for credit losses resulted from \nthe estimated impact of deteriorating economic\nconditions and higher unemployment, partially \noffset by the benefits of government stimulus \nprograms.                                     \n                                              \nCredit Quality The credit quality of the      \nCompany\u2019s loan portfolios is assessed as a    \nfunction of net credit losses, levels of      \nnonperforming assets and delinquencies, and   \ncredit quality ratings as defined by the      \nCompany.                                      \n                                              \nFor all loan classes, loans are considered    \npast due based on the number of days          \ndelinquent except for monthly amortizing loans\nwhich are classified delinquent based upon the\nnumber of contractually required payments not \nmade (for example, two missed payments is     \nconsidered 30 days delinquent). When a loan is\nplaced on nonaccrual status, unpaid accrued   \ninterest is reversed, reducing interest income\nin the current period.                        \n                                              \nCommercial lending segment loans are generally\nplaced on nonaccrual status when the          \ncollection of principal and interest has      \nbecome 90 days past due or is otherwise       \nconsidered doubtful. Commercial lending       \nsegment loans are generally fully or partially\ncharged down to the fair value of the         \ncollateral securing the loan, less costs to   \nsell, when the loan is placed on nonaccrual.  \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    47  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nConsumer lending segment loans are generally  \ncharged-off at a specific number of days or   \npayments past due. Residential mortgages and  \nother retail loans secured by 1-4 family      \nproperties are generally charged down to the  \nfair value of the collateral securing the     \nloan, less costs to sell, at 180 days past    \ndue. Residential mortgage loans and lines in a\nfirst lien position are placed on nonaccrual  \nstatus in instances where a partial charge-off\noccurs unless the loan is well secured and in \nthe process of collection. Residential        \nmortgage loans and lines in a junior lien     \nposition secured by 1-4 family properties are \nplaced on nonaccrual status at 120\u00a0days past  \ndue or when they are behind a first lien that \nhas become 180 days or greater past due or    \nplaced on nonaccrual status. Any secured      \nconsumer lending segment loan whose borrower  \nhas had debt discharged through bankruptcy,   \nfor which the loan amount exceeds the fair    \nvalue of the collateral, is charged down to   \nthe fair value of the related collateral and  \nthe remaining balance is placed on nonaccrual \nstatus. Credit card loans continue to accrue  \ninterest until the account is charged-off.    \nCredit cards are charged-off at 180 days past \ndue. Other retail loans not secured by 1-4    \nfamily properties are charged-off at 120\u00a0days \npast due; and revolving consumer lines are    \ncharged-off at 180 days past due. Similar to  \ncredit cards, other retail loans are generally\nnot placed on nonaccrual status because of the\nrelative short period of time to charge-off.  \nCertain retail customers having financial     \ndifficulties may have the terms of their      \ncredit card and other loan agreements modified\nto require only principal payments and, as    \nsuch, are reported as nonaccrual.             \n                                              \nFor all loan classes, interest payments       \nreceived on nonaccrual loans are generally    \nrecorded as a reduction to a loan\u2019s carrying  \namount while a loan is on nonaccrual and are  \nrecognized as interest income upon payoff of  \nthe loan. However, interest income may be     \nrecognized for interest payments if the       \nremaining carrying amount of the loan is      \nbelieved to be collectible. In certain        \ncircumstances, loans in any class may be      \nrestored to accrual status, such as when a    \nloan has demonstrated sustained repayment     \nperformance or no amounts are past due and    \nprospects for future payment are no longer in \ndoubt; or when the loan becomes well secured  \nand is in the process of collection. Loans    \nwhere there has been a partial charge-off may \nbe returned to accrual status if all principal\nand interest (including amounts previously    \ncharged-off) is expected to be collected and  \nthe loan is current. Generally, purchased     \ncredit deteriorated loans are considered      \naccruing loans. However, the timing and amount\nof future cash flows for some loans is not    \nreasonably estimable, and those loans are     \nclassified as nonaccrual loans with interest  \nincome not recognized until the timing and    \namount of the future cash flows can be        \nreasonably estimated.                         \nThe following table provides a summary of     \nloans by portfolio class, including the       \ndelinquency status of those that continue to  \naccrue interest, and those that are           \nnonperforming:                                \n                                              \n                         90                   \n                         D\u2026                   \n                         or                   \n                         M\u2026                   \n         \u2026       \u2026       P\u2026       \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026       D\u2026       \u2026       T\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  90    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026        2       \u2026       4\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       7\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2013       2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       90       \u2026       5\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  5\u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  79    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026        3       \u2026       3\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       7\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2013       2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       97       \u2026       5\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  6\u2026    $  \u2026    $  2\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n       At June\u00a030, 2020, $656million of       \n       loans 30\u201389 days past due and          \n       $1.7billion of loans 90 days or more   \n       past due purchased from Government     \n       National Mortgage Association          \n       (\u201cGNMA\u201d) mortgage pools whose          \n  (a)  repayments are insured by the Federal  \n       Housing Administration or guaranteed   \n       by the United States Department of     \n       Veterans Affairs, were classified as   \n       current, compared with $428million     \n       and $1.7billion at December\u00a031, 2019,  \n       respectively.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Substantially all nonperforming loans  \n       at June\u00a030, 2020 and December\u00a031,      \n       2019, had an associated allowance for  \n       credit losses.

The Company recognizes interest on  \nTDRs if the borrower complies with the revised\nterms and conditions as agreed upon with the  \nCompany and has demonstrated repayment        \nperformance at a level commensurate with the  \nmodified terms over several payment cycles,   \nwhich is generally six months or greater.

The post-       \nmodification balances for these loans reflect \nthe current outstanding balance until a       \npermanent modification is made. In addition,  \nthe post-modification balances typically      \ninclude capitalization of unpaid accrued      \ninterest and/or fees under the various        \nmodification programs. For those loans        \nmodified as TDRs during the second quarter of \n2020, at June\u00a030, 2020, 29 residential        \nmortgages, 13 home equity and second mortgage \nloans and 349 loans purchased from GNMA       \nmortgage pools with outstanding balances of $ \n8 million, $ 1 million and $ 48 million,      \nrespectively, were in a trial period and have \nestimated post-modification balances of $ 7   \nmillion, $ 1 million and $ 48 million,        \nrespectively, assuming permanent modification \noccurs at the end of the trial period.        \n                                              \nThe Company has implemented certain           \nrestructuring programs that may result in     \nTDRs. However, many of the Company\u2019s TDRs are \nalso determined on a case-by-case basis in    \nconnection with ongoing loan collection       \nprocesses.                                    \n                                              \nFor the commercial lending segment,           \nmodifications generally result in the Company \nworking with borrowers on a case-by-case      \nbasis. Commercial and commercial real estate  \nmodifications generally include extensions of \nthe maturity date and may be accompanied by an\nincrease or decrease to the interest rate,    \nwhich may not be deemed a market interest     \nrate. In addition, the Company may work with  \nthe borrower in identifying other changes that\nmitigate loss to the Company, which may       \ninclude additional collateral or guarantees to\nsupport the loan. To a lesser extent, the     \nCompany may waive contractual principal. The  \nCompany classifies all of the above           \nconcessions as TDRs to the extent the Company \ndetermines that the borrower is experiencing  \nfinancial difficulty.                         \n                                              \nModifications for the consumer lending segment\nare generally part of programs the Company has\ninitiated. The Company modifies residential   \nmortgage loans under Federal Housing          \nAdministration, United States Department of   \nVeterans Affairs, or its own internal         \nprograms. Under these programs, the Company   \noffers qualifying homeowners the opportunity  \nto permanently modify their loan and achieve  \nmore affordable monthly payments by providing \nloan concessions. These concessions may       \ninclude adjustments to interest rates,        \nconversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates,\n                      \n  50    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nextension of maturity dates or deferrals of   \npayments, capitalization of accrued interest  \nand/or outstanding advances, or in limited    \nsituations, partial forgiveness of loan       \nprincipal. In most instances, participation in\nresidential mortgage loan restructuring       \nprograms requires the customer to complete a  \nshort-term trial period. A permanent loan     \nmodification is contingent on the customer    \nsuccessfully completing the trial period      \narrangement, and the loan documents are not   \nmodified until that time. The Company reports \nloans in a trial period arrangement as TDRs   \nand continues to report them as TDRs after the\ntrial period.                                 \n                                              \nCredit card and other retail loan TDRs are    \ngenerally part of distinct restructuring      \nprograms providing customers experiencing     \nfinancial difficulty with modifications       \nwhereby balances may be amortized up to 60    \nmonths, and generally include waiver of fees  \nand reduced interest rates.                   \n                                              \nIn addition, the Company considers secured    \nloans to consumer borrowers that have debt    \ndischarged through bankruptcy where the       \nborrower has not reaffirmed the debt to be    \nTDRs.                                         \n                                              \nLoan modifications or concessions granted to  \nborrowers resulting directly from the effects \nof the COVID-19 pandemic, who were otherwise  \nin current payment status, are not considered \nto be TDRs.

These loans had aggregate outstanding\nbalances of $ 15million and $ 34million for   \nthe three months and six months ended June 30,\n2020, respectively.                           \n                                              \nAs of June 30, 2020, the Company had $        \n116million of commitments to lend additional  \nfunds to borrowers whose terms of their       \noutstanding owed balances have been modified  \nin troubled debt restructurings.              \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    51  \n                      \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n            Accounting\u00a0for\u00a0Transfers\u00a0and\u00a0     \n  Note\u00a05    Servicing\u00a0of\u00a0Financial\u00a0Assets\u00a0    \n            and\u00a0Variable\u00a0Interest\u00a0Entities    \n                                              \nThe Company transfers financial assets in the \nnormal course of business. The majority of the\nCompany\u2019s financial asset transfers are       \nresidential mortgage loan sales primarily to  \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d),    \ntransfers of tax-advantaged investments,      \ncommercial loan sales through participation   \nagreements, and other individual or portfolio \nloan and securities sales. In accordance with \nthe accounting guidance for asset transfers,  \nthe Company considers any ongoing involvement \nwith transferred assets in determining whether\nthe assets can be derecognized from the       \nbalance sheet. Guarantees provided to certain \nthird parties in connection with the transfer \nof assets are further discussed in Note 15.   \nFor loans sold under participation agreements,\nthe Company also considers whether the terms  \nof the loan participation agreement meet the  \naccounting definition of a participating      \ninterest. With the exception of servicing and \ncertain performance-based guarantees, the     \nCompany\u2019s continuing involvement with         \nfinancial assets sold is minimal and generally\nlimited to market customary representation and\nwarranty clauses. Any gain or loss on sale    \ndepends on the previous carrying amount of the\ntransferred financial assets, the             \nconsideration received, and any liabilities   \nincurred in exchange for the transferred      \nassets. Upon transfer, any servicing assets   \nand other interests that continue to be held  \nby the Company are initially recognized at    \nfair value. For further information on        \nmortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d), refer to  \nNote 6 . On a limited basis, the Company may  \nacquire and package high-grade corporate bonds\nfor select corporate customers, in which the  \nCompany generally has no continuing           \ninvolvement with these transactions.          \nAdditionally, the Company is an authorized    \nGNMA issuer and issues GNMA securities on a   \nregular basis. The Company has no other asset \nsecuritizations or similar asset-backed       \nfinancing arrangements that are off-balance   \nsheet.                                        \nThe Company also provides financial support   \nprimarily through the use of waivers of trust \nand investment management fees associated with\nvarious unconsolidated registered money market\nfunds it manages. The Company provided $      \n13million and $ 7million of support to the    \nfunds during the three months ended June 30,  \n2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 21million  \nand $ 14million during the six months ended   \nJune 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.         \nThe Company is involved in various entities   \nthat are considered to be variable interest   \nentities (\u201cVIEs\u201d). The Company\u2019s investments  \nin VIEs are primarily related to investments  \npromoting affordable housing, community       \ndevelopment and renewable energy sources. Some\nof these tax-advantaged investments support   \nthe Company\u2019s regulatory compliance with the  \nCommunity Reinvestment Act. The Company\u2019s     \ninvestments in these entities generate a      \nreturn primarily through the realization of   \nfederal and state income tax credits, and     \nother tax benefits, such as tax deductions    \nfrom operating losses of the investments, over\nspecified time periods. These tax credits are \nrecognized as a reduction of tax expense or,  \nfor investments qualifying as investment tax  \ncredits, as a reduction to the related        \ninvestment asset. The Company recognized      \nfederal and state income tax credits related  \nto its affordable housing and other tax-      \nadvantaged investments in tax expense of $ 145\nmillion and $ 146 million for the three months\nended June\u00a030, 2020 and 2019, respectively,   \nand $ 295 million and $ 291 million for the   \nsix months ended June\u00a030, 2020 and 2019,      \nrespectively. The Company also recognized $ 90\nmillion and $ 162 million of investment tax   \ncredits for the three months ended June\u00a030,   \n2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 189 million\nand $ 246 million for the six months ended    \nJune\u00a030, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The     \nCompany recognized $ 145 million and $ 137    \nmillion of expenses related to all of these   \ninvestments for the three months ended        \nJune\u00a030, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of which\n$ 99 million and $ 76 million, respectively,  \nwere included in tax expense and the remaining\namounts were included in noninterest expense. \nThe Company recognized $ 287 million and $ 269\nmillion of expenses related to all of these   \ninvestments for the six months ended June\u00a030, \n2020 and 2019, respectively, of which $ 200   \nmillion and $ 157 million, respectively, were \nincluded in tax expense and the remaining     \namounts were included in noninterest expense. \nThe Company is not required to consolidate    \nVIEs in which it has concluded it does not    \nhave a controlling financial interest, and    \nthus is not the primary beneficiary. In such  \ncases, the Company does not have both the     \npower to direct the entities\u2019 most significant\nactivities and the obligation to absorb losses\nor the right to receive benefits that could   \npotentially be significant to the VIEs.       \nThe Company\u2019s investments in these            \nunconsolidated VIEs are carried in other      \nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The \nCompany\u2019s unfunded capital and other          \ncommitments related to these unconsolidated   \nVIEs are generally carried in other           \nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe Company\u2019s maximum exposure to loss from   \nthese unconsolidated VIEs include the         \ninvestment recorded on the Company\u2019s          \nConsolidated Balance Sheet, net of unfunded   \ncapital commitments, and previously recorded  \ntax credits which remain subject to recapture \nby taxing authorities based on compliance     \nfeatures required to be met at the project    \nlevel. While the Company believes potential   \nlosses from these                             \n                      \n  52    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\ninvestments are remote, the maximum exposure  \nwas determined by assuming a scenario where   \nthe community-based business and housing      \nprojects completely fail and do not meet      \ncertain government compliance requirements    \nresulting in recapture of the related tax     \ncredits.                                      \nThe following table provides a summary of     \ninvestments in community development and tax- \nadvantaged VIEs that the Company has not      \nconsolidated:                                 \n                                              \n  (Dollars                          December  \n  in              June\u00a030,               31,  \n  Millions)           2020              2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Investme\u2026                                   \n  carrying     $     6,345    $        6,148  \n  amount                                      \n  Unfunded                                    \n  capital            2,966             2,938  \n  and other                                   \n  commitme\u2026                                   \n  Maximum                                     \n  exposure          12,204            12,118  \n  to loss                                     \n                                              \nThe Company also has noncontrolling financial \ninvestments in private investment funds and   \npartnerships considered to be VIEs, which are \nnot consolidated. The Company\u2019s recorded      \ninvestment in these entities, carried in other\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, was \napproximately $ 34 million at June\u00a030, 2020   \nand $ 31 million at December\u00a031, 2019. The    \nmaximum exposure to loss related to these VIEs\nwas $ 55 million at June\u00a030, 2020 and         \nDecember\u00a031, 2019, representing the Company\u2019s \ninvestment balance and its unfunded           \ncommitments to invest additional amounts.     \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s individual net investments in   \nunconsolidated VIEs, which exclude any        \nunfunded capital commitments, ranged from less\nthan $ 1million to $ 84million at June 30,    \n2020, compared with less than $ 1million to $ \n87million at December 31, 2019.               \n                                              \nThe Company is required to consolidate VIEs in\nwhich it has concluded it has a controlling   \nfinancial interest. The Company sponsors      \nentities to which it transfers its interests  \nin tax-advantaged investments to third        \nparties. At June\u00a030, 2020, approximately $ 3.7\nbillion of the Company\u2019s assets and $ 2.9     \nbillion of its liabilities included on the    \nConsolidated Balance Sheet were related to    \ncommunity development and tax-advantaged      \ninvestment VIEs which the Company has         \nconsolidated, primarily related to these      \ntransfers. These amounts compared to $ 4.0    \nbillion and $ 3.2 billion, respectively, at   \nDecember\u00a031, 2019. The majority of the assets \nof these consolidated VIEs are reported in    \nother assets, and the liabilities are reported\nin long-term debt and other liabilities. The  \nassets of a particular VIE are the primary    \nsource of funds to settle its obligations. The\ncreditors of the VIEs do not have recourse to \nthe general credit of the Company. The        \nCompany\u2019s exposure to the consolidated VIEs is\ngenerally limited to the carrying value of its\nvariable interests plus any related tax       \ncredits previously recognized or transferred  \nto others with a guarantee.                   \n                                              \nIn addition, the Company sponsors a municipal \nbond securities tender option bond program.   \nThe Company controls the activities of the    \nprogram\u2019s entities, is entitled to the        \nresidual returns and provides liquidity and   \nremarketing arrangements to the program. As a \nresult, the Company has consolidated the      \nprogram\u2019s entities. At June\u00a030, 2020, $ 3.0   \nbillion of available-for-sale investment      \nsecurities and $ 1.5 billion of short-term    \nborrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet  \nwere related to the tender option bond        \nprogram, compared with $ 3.0 billion of       \navailable-for-sale investment securities and $\n2.7 billion of short-term borrowings at       \nDecember\u00a031, 2019.                            \n                                       \n  Note\u00a06    Mortgage Servicing Rights  \n                                       \nThe Company capitalizes MSRs as separate      \nassets when loans are sold and servicing is   \nretained. MSRs may also be purchased from     \nothers. The Company carries MSRs at fair      \nvalue, with changes in the fair value recorded\nin earnings during the period in which they   \noccur. The Company serviced $ 220.3billion of \nresidential mortgage loans for others at June \n30, 2020, and $ 226.0billion at December 31,  \n2019, including subserviced mortgages with no \ncorresponding MSR asset. Included in mortgage \nbanking revenue are the MSR fair value changes\narising from market rate and model assumption \nchanges, net of the value change in           \nderivatives used to economically hedge MSRs.  \nThese changes resulted in net gains of $      \n24million and net losses of $ 14million for   \nthe three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively, and net gains of $ 49million and\nnet losses of $ 3million for the six months   \nended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.   \nLoan servicing and ancillary fees, not        \nincluding valuation changes, included in      \nmortgage banking revenue were $ 174million and\n$ 180million for the three months ended June  \n30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $        \n360million and $ 359million for the six months\nended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.   \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    53  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nChanges in fair value of capitalized MSRs are \nsummarized as follows:                        \n                                              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026          \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026         \u2026    \n         3          6          8         7    \n         \u2026          \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n         1          \u2013          2         \u2013    \n                                              \n         \u2026  )       \u2026  )       \u2026  )      \u2026    \n         \u2026          4          \u2026         \u2026    \n         \u2026  )       \u2026  )       \u2026  )      \u2026    \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026         \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n       MSRs sold in 2020 include those        \n  (a)  having a negative fair value,          \n       resulting from the loans being         \n       severely delinquent.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Includes changes in MSR value          \n       associated with changes in market      \n  (b)  interest rates, including estimated    \n       prepayment rates and anticipated       \n       earnings on escrow deposits.           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Includes changes in MSR value not      \n       caused by changes in market interest   \n  (c)  rates, such as changes in cost to      \n       service, ancillary income and option   \n       adjusted spread, as well as the        \n       impact of any model changes.           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Primarily represents changes due to    \n  (d)  realization of expected cash flows     \n       over time (decay).                     \n                                              \nThe estimated sensitivity to changes in       \ninterest rates of the fair value of the MSR   \nportfolio and the related derivative          \ninstruments was as follows:                   \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nThe fair value of MSRs and their sensitivity  \nto changes in interest rates is influenced by \nthe mix of the servicing portfolio and        \ncharacteristics of each segment of the        \nportfolio.

On  \nan ongoing basis, numerous federal, state,    \nlocal and foreign examinations are in progress\nand cover multiple tax years. As of June 30,  \n2020, federal tax examinations for all years  \nending through December 31, 2010, and years   \nending December 31, 2013, and December 31,    \n2014 are completed and resolved. The Company\u2019s\ntax returns for the years ended December 31,  \n2011, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 are     \nunder examination by the Internal Revenue     \nService. The years open to examination by     \nforeign, state and local government           \nauthorities vary by jurisdiction.             \nThe Company\u2019s net deferred tax asset was $    \n900million at June 30, 2020 and $ 382million  \nat December 31, 2019.                         \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    57  \n                      \nTable of Contents\n                                     \n  Note\u00a012    Derivative Instruments  \n                                     \nIn the ordinary course of business, the       \nCompany enters into derivative transactions to\nmanage various risks and to accommodate the   \nbusiness requirements of its customers. The   \nCompany recognizes all derivatives on the     \nConsolidated Balance Sheet at fair value in   \nother assets or in other liabilities. On the  \ndate the Company enters into a derivative     \ncontract, the derivative is designated as     \neither a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge,   \nnet investment hedge, or a designation is not \nmade as it is a customer-related transaction, \nan economic hedge for asset/liability risk    \nmanagement purposes or another stand-alone    \nderivative created through the Company\u2019s      \noperations (\u201cfree-standing derivative\u201d). When \na derivative is designated as a fair value,   \ncash flow or net investment hedge, the Company\nperforms an assessment, at inception and, at a\nminimum, quarterly thereafter, to determine   \nthe effectiveness of the derivative in        \noffsetting changes in the value or cash flows \nof the hedged item(s).                        \nFair Value Hedges These derivatives are       \ninterest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge \nthe change in fair value related to interest  \nrate changes of its underlying fixed-rate     \ndebt. Changes in the fair value of derivatives\ndesignated as fair value hedges, and changes  \nin the fair value of the hedged items, are    \nrecorded in earnings.                         \nCash Flow Hedges These derivatives are        \ninterest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge \nthe forecasted cash flows from its underlying \nvariable-rate debt. Changes in the fair value \nof derivatives designated as cash flow hedges \nare recorded in other comprehensive income    \n(loss) until the cash flows of the hedged     \nitems are realized. If a derivative designated\nas a cash flow hedge is terminated or ceases  \nto be highly effective, the gain or loss in   \nother comprehensive income (loss) is amortized\nto earnings over the period the forecasted    \nhedged transactions impact earnings. If a     \nhedged forecasted transaction is no longer    \nprobable, hedge accounting is ceased and any  \ngain or loss included in other comprehensive  \nincome (loss) is reported in earnings         \nimmediately, unless the forecasted transaction\nis at least reasonably possible of occurring, \nwhereby the amounts remain within other       \ncomprehensive income (loss). At June 30, 2020,\nthe Company had $ 240million (net-of-tax)of   \nrealized and unrealized losses on derivatives \nclassified as cash flow hedges recorded in    \nother comprehensive income (loss), compared   \nwith $ 51million (net-of-tax)of realized and  \nunrealized losses at December 31, 2019. The   \nestimated amount to be reclassified from other\ncomprehensive income (loss) into earnings     \nduring the remainder of 2020 and the next 12  \nmonths are losses of $ 18million (net-of-     \ntax)and $ 44million (net-of-tax),respectively.\nAll cash flow hedges were highly effective for\nthe three months ended June 30, 2020.         \nNet Investment Hedges The Company uses forward\ncommitments to sell specified amounts of      \ncertain foreign currencies, and non-          \nderivativedebt instruments, to hedge the      \nvolatility of its net investment in foreign   \noperations driven by fluctuations in foreign  \ncurrency exchange rates. The carrying amount  \nof non-derivativedebt instruments designated  \nas net investment hedges was $ 1.3billion at  \nJune 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.          \nOther Derivative Positions The Company enters \ninto free-standing derivatives to mitigate    \ninterest rate risk and for other risk         \nmanagement purposes. These derivatives include\nforward commitments to sell to-be-            \nannouncedsecurities (\u201cTBAs\u201d) and other        \ncommitments to sell residential mortgage      \nloans, which are used to economically hedge   \nthe interest rate risk related to mortgage    \nloans held for sale (\u201cMLHFS\u201d) and unfunded    \nmortgage loan commitments. The Company also   \nenters into interest rate swaps, swaptions,   \nforward commitments to buy TBAs, U.S. Treasury\nand Eurodollar futures and options on U.S.    \nTreasury futures to economically hedge the    \nchange in the fair value of the Company\u2019s     \nMSRs. The Company also enters into foreign    \ncurrency forwards to economically hedge       \nremeasurement gains and losses the Company    \nrecognizes on foreign currency denominated    \nassets and liabilities. In addition, the      \nCompany acts as a seller and buyer of interest\nrate derivatives and foreign exchange         \ncontracts for its customers.

The Company measures    \nthat credit risk using a credit valuation     \nadjustment and includes it within the fair    \nvalue of the derivative. The Company manages  \ncounterparty credit risk through              \ndiversification of its derivative positions   \namong various counterparties, by entering into\nderivative positions that are centrally       \ncleared through clearinghouses, by entering   \ninto master netting arrangements and, where   \npossible, by requiring collateral             \narrangements. A master netting arrangement    \nallows two counterparties, who have multiple  \nderivative contracts with each other, the     \nability to net settle amounts under all       \ncontracts, including any related collateral,  \nthrough a single payment and in a single      \ncurrency. Collateral arrangements generally   \nrequire the counterparty to deliver collateral\n(typically cash or U.S. Treasury and agency   \nsecurities) equal to the Company\u2019s net        \nderivative receivable, subject to minimum     \ntransfer and credit rating requirements.      \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s collateral arrangements are     \npredominately bilateral and, therefore,       \ncontain provisions that require               \ncollateralization of the Company\u2019s net        \nliability derivative positions. Required      \ncollateral coverage is based on net liability \nthresholds and may be contingent upon the     \nCompany\u2019s credit rating from two of the       \nnationally recognized                         \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    61  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nstatistical rating organizations. If the      \nCompany\u2019s credit rating were to fall below    \ncredit ratings thresholds established in the  \ncollateral arrangements, the counterparties to\nthe derivatives could request immediate       \nadditional collateral coverage up to and      \nincluding full collateral coverage for        \nderivatives in a net liability position. The  \naggregate fair value of all derivatives under \ncollateral arrangements that were in a net    \nliability position at June 30, 2020, was $    \n1.4billion. At June 30, 2020, the Company had \n$ 1.1billion of cash posted as collateral     \nagainst this net liability position.          \n                                              \n             Netting Arrangements for         \n  Note\u00a013    Certain Financial Instruments    \n             and Securities Financing         \n             Activities                       \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s derivative portfolio consists of\nbilateral over-the-counter trades, certain    \ninterest rate derivatives and credit contracts\nrequired to be centrally cleared through      \nclearinghouses per current regulations, and   \nexchange-traded positions which may include   \nU.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures or       \noptions on U.S. Treasury futures. Of the      \nCompany\u2019s $ 651.3 billion total notional      \namount of derivative positions at June\u00a030,    \n2020, $ 317.4 billion related to bilateral    \nover-the-counter trades, $ 318.2 billion      \nrelated to those centrally cleared through    \nclearinghouses and $ 15.7 billion related to  \nthose that were exchange-traded. The Company\u2019s\nderivative contracts typically include        \noffsetting rights (referred to as netting     \narrangements), and depending on expected      \nvolume, credit risk, and counterparty         \npreference, collateral maintenance may be     \nrequired. For all derivatives under collateral\nsupport arrangements, fair value is determined\ndaily and, depending on the collateral        \nmaintenance requirements, the Company and a   \ncounterparty may receive or deliver           \ncollateral, based upon the net fair value of  \nall derivative positions between the Company  \nand the counterparty. Collateral is typically \ncash, but securities may be allowed under     \ncollateral arrangements with certain          \ncounterparties. Receivables and payables      \nrelated to cash collateral are included in    \nother assets and other liabilities on the     \nConsolidated Balance Sheet, along with the    \nrelated derivative asset and liability fair   \nvalues. Any securities pledged to             \ncounterparties as collateral remain on the    \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Securities        \nreceived from counterparties as collateral are\nnot recognized on the Consolidated Balance    \nSheet, unless the counterparty defaults. In   \ngeneral, securities used as collateral can be \nsold, repledged or otherwise used by the party\nin possession. No restrictions exist on the   \nuse of cash collateral by either party. Refer \nto Note 12 for further discussion of the      \nCompany\u2019s derivatives, including collateral   \narrangements.                                 \nAs part of the Company\u2019s treasury and broker- \ndealer operations, the Company executes       \ntransactions that are treated as securities   \nsold under agreements to repurchase or        \nsecurities purchased under agreements to      \nresell, both of which are accounted for as    \ncollateralized financings. Securities sold    \nunder agreements to repurchase include        \nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned   \ntransactions. Securities purchased under      \nagreements to resell include reverse          \nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed \ntransactions. For securities sold under       \nagreements to repurchase, the Company records \na liability for the cash received, which is   \nincluded in short-term borrowings on the      \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. For securities    \npurchased under agreements to resell, the     \nCompany records a receivable for the cash     \npaid, which is included in other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.                   \nSecurities transferred to counterparties under\nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned   \ntransactions continue to be recognized on the \nConsolidated Balance Sheet, are measured at   \nfair value, and are included in investment    \nsecurities or other assets. Securities        \nreceived from counterparties under reverse    \nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed \ntransactions are not recognized on the        \nConsolidated Balance Sheet unless the         \ncounterparty defaults. The securities         \ntransferred under repurchase and reverse      \nrepurchase transactions typically are U.S.    \nTreasury and agency securities, residential   \nagency mortgage-backed securities or corporate\ndebt securities. The securities loaned or     \nborrowed typically are corporate debt         \nsecurities traded by the Company\u2019s broker-    \ndealer subsidiary. In general, the securities \ntransferred can be sold, repledged or         \notherwise used by the party in possession. No \nrestrictions exist on the use of cash         \ncollateral by either party. Repurchase/reverse\nrepurchase and securities loaned/borrowed     \ntransactions expose the Company to            \ncounterparty risk. The Company manages this   \nrisk by performing assessments, independent of\nbusiness line managers, and establishing      \nconcentration limits on each counterparty.    \nAdditionally, these transactions include      \ncollateral arrangements that require the fair \nvalues of the underlying securities to be     \ndetermined daily, resulting in cash being     \nobtained or refunded to counterparties to     \nmaintain specified collateral levels.         \n                      \n  62    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the maturities \nby category of collateral pledged for         \nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned   \ntransactions:                                 \n                                              \n                 \u2026                \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026                \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026                \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       T\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       6\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       3\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       3\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  2\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       6\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       50  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       50  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  1\u2026  \n                                              \nThe Company executes its derivative,          \nrepurchase/reverse repurchase and securities  \nloaned/borrowed transactions under the        \nrespective industry standard agreements.

Additionally, from time to   \ntime, the Company may be required to record at\nfair value other assets on a nonrecurring     \nbasis, such as loans held for sale, loans held\nfor investment and certain other assets. These\nnonrecurring fair value adjustments typically \ninvolve application of lower-of-cost-or-fair  \nvalue accounting or impairment write-downs of \nindividual assets.                            \nFair value is defined as the exchange price   \nthat would be received for an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability (an exit price) in the   \nprincipal or most advantageous market for the \nasset or liability in an orderly transaction  \nbetween market participants on the measurement\ndate. A fair value measurement reflects all of\nthe assumptions that market participants would\nuse in pricing the asset or liability,        \nincluding assumptions about the risk inherent \nin a particular valuation technique, the      \neffect of a restriction on the sale or use of \nan asset and the risk of nonperformance.      \nThe Company groups its assets and liabilities \nmeasured at fair value into a three-level     \nhierarchy for valuation techniques used to    \nmeasure financial assets and financial        \nliabilities at fair value. This hierarchy is  \nbased on whether the valuation inputs are     \nobservable or unobservable. These levels are: \n                                              \n       Level\u00a01 \u2014 Quoted prices in active      \n       markets for identical assets or        \n  \u2022    liabilities.

Where   \nappropriate, the descriptions include         \ninformation about the valuation models and key\ninputs to those models. During the six months \nended June 30, 2020 and 2019, there were no   \nsignificant changes to the valuation          \ntechniques used by the Company to measure fair\nvalue. Available-For-SaleInvestment Securities\nWhen quoted market prices for identical       \nsecurities are available in an active market, \nthese prices are used to determine fair value \nand these securities are classified within    \nLevel 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 1  \ninvestment securities include U.S. Treasury   \nand exchange-traded securities. For other     \nsecurities, quoted market prices may not be   \nreadily available for the specific securities.\nWhen possible, the Company determines fair    \nvalue based on market observable information, \nincluding quoted market prices for similar    \nsecurities, inactive transaction prices, and  \nbroker quotes. These securities are classified\nwithin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.   \nLevel 2 valuations are generally provided by a\nthird-party pricing service. Level 2          \ninvestment securities are predominantly agency\nmortgage-backed securities, certain other     \nasset-backed securities, obligations of state \nand political subdivisions and agency debt    \nsecurities. Mortgage Loans Held For Sale MLHFS\nmeasured at fair value, for which an active   \nsecondary market and readily available market \nprices exist, are initially valued at the     \ntransaction price and are subsequently valued \nby comparison to instruments with similar     \ncollateral and risk profiles. MLHFS are       \nclassified within Level 2. Included in        \nmortgage banking revenue was a net gain of $  \n81million and $ 25million for the three months\nended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively,   \nand a net gain of $ 174million and $ 43million\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2020 and    \n2019, respectively, from the changes to fair  \nvalue of these MLHFS under fair value option  \naccounting guidance. Changes in fair value due\nto instrument specific credit risk were       \nimmaterial. Interest income for MLHFS is      \nmeasured based on contractual interest rates  \nand reported as interest income on the        \nConsolidated Statement of Income. Electing to \nmeasure MLHFS at fair value reduces certain   \ntiming differences and better matches changes \nin fair value of these assets with changes in \nthe value of the derivative instruments used  \nto economically hedge them without the burden \nof complying with the requirements for hedge  \naccounting. Mortgage Servicing Rights MSRs are\nvalued using a discounted cash flow           \nmethodology, and are classified within Level  \n3. The Company determines fair value of the   \nMSRs by projecting future cash flows for      \ndifferent interest rate scenarios using       \nprepayment rates and other assumptions, and   \ndiscounts these cash flows using a risk       \nadjusted rate based on option adjusted spread \nlevels. There is minimal observable market    \nactivity for MSRs on comparable portfolios    \nand, therefore, the determination of fair     \nvalue requires significant management         \njudgment. Refer to Note 6 for further         \ninformation on MSR valuation assumptions.     \nDerivatives The majority of derivatives held  \nby the Company are executed over-the-counteror\ncentrally cleared through clearinghouses and  \nare valued using market standard cash flow    \nvaluation techniques. The models incorporate  \ninputs, depending on the type of derivative,  \nincluding interest rate curves, foreign       \nexchange rates and volatility. All derivative \nvalues incorporate an assessment of the risk  \nof counterparty nonperformance, measured based\non the Company\u2019s evaluation of credit risk    \nincluding external assessments of credit risk.\nThe Company monitors and manages its          \nnonperformance risk by considering its ability\nto net derivative positions under master      \nnetting arrangements, as well as collateral   \nreceived or provided under collateral         \narrangements. Accordingly, the Company has    \nelected to measure the fair value of          \nderivatives, at a counterparty level, on a net\nbasis. The majority of the derivatives are    \nclassified within Level 2 of the fair value   \nhierarchy, as the significant inputs to the   \nmodels, including nonperformance risk, are    \nobservable. However, certain derivative       \ntransactions are with counterparties where    \nrisk of nonperformance cannot be observed in  \nthe market and, therefore, the credit         \nvaluation adjustments result in these         \nderivatives being classified within Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy. The Company also has\nother derivative contracts that are created   \nthrough its operations, including commitments \nto purchase and originate mortgage loans and  \nswap agreements executed in conjunction with  \nthe sale of a portion of its Class B common   \nand preferred shares of Visa Inc. (the \u201cVisa  \nswaps\u201d). The mortgage loan commitments are    \nvalued by pricing models that include market  \nobservable and unobservable inputs, which     \nresult in the commitments being classified    \nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.   \nThe unobservable inputs include assumptions   \nabout the percentage of commitments that      \nactually become a closed loan and the MSR     \nvalue that is inherent in the underlying loan \nvalue. The Visa swaps require payments by     \neither the Company or the purchaser of the    \nVisa Inc. Class B common and preferred shares \nwhen there are changes in the conversion rate \nof the Visa Inc. Class B common and preferred \nshares to Visa Inc. Class A common and        \npreferred shares, respectively, as well as    \nquarterly payments to the purchaser based on  \nspecified terms of the agreements. Management \nreviews and updates the Visa swaps fair value \nin conjunction with its                       \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    65  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nreview of Visa Inc. related litigation        \ncontingencies, and the associated escrow      \nfunding. The expected litigation resolution   \nimpacts the Visa Inc. Class B common share to \nVisa Inc. Class A common share conversion     \nrate, as well as the ultimate termination date\nfor the Visa swaps. Accordingly, the Visa     \nswaps are classified within Level 3.

This section includes a        \ndescription of the significant inputs used by \nthe Company and a description of any          \ninterrelationships between these inputs. The  \ndiscussion below excludes nonrecurring fair   \nvalue measurements of collateral value used   \nfor impairment measures for loans and OREO.   \nThese valuations utilize third-party appraisal\nor broker price opinions, and are classified  \nas Level 3 due to the significant judgment    \ninvolved.                                     \n                                              \nMortgage Servicing Rights The significant     \nunobservable inputs used in the fair value    \nmeasurement of the Company\u2019s MSRs are expected\nprepayments and the option adjusted spread    \nthat is added to the risk-free rate to        \ndiscount projected cash flows. Significant    \nincreases in either of these inputs in        \nisolation would have resulted in a            \nsignificantly lower fair value measurement.   \nSignificant decreases in either of these      \ninputs in isolation would have resulted in a  \nsignificantly higher fair value measurement.  \nThere is no direct interrelationship between  \nprepayments and option adjusted spread.       \nPrepayment rates generally move in the        \nopposite direction of market interest rates.  \nOption adjusted spread is generally impacted  \nby changes in market return requirements.     \nThe following table shows the significant     \nvaluation assumption ranges for MSRs at June  \n30, 2020:                                     \n                                              \n                                   Weigh\u2026     \n          Minim\u2026       Maxi\u2026       Avera\u2026     \n                                      (a)     \n  Exp\u2026        15  %       25  %        20  %  \n  pre\u2026                                        \n  Opt\u2026                                        \n  adj\u2026         5           7            6     \n  spr\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Determined based on the relative fair  \n  (a)  value of the related mortgage loans    \n       serviced.                              \n                                              \nDerivatives The Company has two distinct Level\n3 derivative portfolios: (i) the Company\u2019s    \ncommitments to purchase and originate mortgage\nloans that meet the requirements of a         \nderivative and (ii) the Company\u2019s             \nasset/liability and customer-related          \nderivatives that are Level 3 due to           \nunobservable inputs related to measurement of \nrisk of nonperformance by the counterparty. In\naddition, the Company\u2019s Visa swaps are        \nclassified within Level 3.                    \n                                              \nThe significant unobservable inputs used in   \nthe fair value measurement of the Company\u2019s   \nderivative commitments to purchase and        \noriginate mortgage loans are the percentage of\ncommitments that actually become a closed loan\nand the MSR value that is inherent in the     \nunderlying loan value. A significant increase \nin the rate of loans that close would have    \nresulted in a larger derivative asset or      \nliability. A significant increase in the      \ninherent MSR value would have resulted in an  \nincrease in the derivative asset or a         \nreduction in the derivative liability.        \nExpected loan close rates and the inherent MSR\nvalues are directly impacted by changes in    \nmarket rates and will generally move in the   \nsame direction as interest rates.             \nThe following table shows the significant     \nvaluation assumption ranges for the Company\u2019s \nderivative commitments to purchase and        \noriginate mortgage loans at June 30, 2020:    \n                                              \n                                   Weigh\u2026     \n          Minim\u2026       Maxi\u2026       Avera\u2026     \n                                      (a)     \n  Exp\u2026                                        \n  loan        10  %      100  %        75  %  \n  clo\u2026                                        \n  rate                                        \n  Inh\u2026                                        \n  MSR                                         \n  val\u2026                                        \n  (ba\u2026        36         171          106     \n  poi\u2026                                        \n  per                                         \n  loa\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  (a)  Determined based on the relative fair  \n       value of the related mortgage loans.   \n                                              \nThe significant unobservable input used in the\nfair value measurement of certain of the      \nCompany\u2019s asset/liability and customer-related\nderivatives is the credit valuation adjustment\nrelated to the risk of counterparty           \nnonperformance. A significant increase in the \ncredit valuation adjustment would have        \nresulted in a lower fair value measurement. A \nsignificant decrease in the credit valuation  \nadjustment would have resulted in a higher    \nfair value measurement. The credit valuation  \nadjustment is impacted by changes in market   \nrates, volatility, market implied credit      \nspreads, and loss recovery rates, as well as  \nthe Company\u2019s assessment of the counterparty\u2019s\ncredit position.

In 2007, Visa completed\na restructuring and issued shares of Visa Inc.\ncommon stock to its financial institution     \nmembers in contemplation of its initial public\noffering (\u201cIPO\u201d) completed in the first       \nquarter of 2008 (the \u201cVisa Reorganization\u201d).  \nAs a part of the Visa Reorganization, the     \nCompany received its proportionate number of  \nshares of Visa Inc. common stock, which were  \nsubsequently converted to Class B shares of   \nVisa Inc. (\u201cClass B shares\u201d).                 \nVisa U.S.A. Inc. (\u201cVisa U.S.A.\u201d) and          \nMasterCard International (collectively, the   \n\u201cCard Brands\u201d) are defendants in antitrust    \nlawsuits challenging the practices of the Card\nBrands (the \u201cVisa Litigation\u201d). Visa U.S.A.   \nmember banks have a contingent obligation to  \nindemnify Visa Inc. under the Visa U.S.A.     \nbylaws (which were modified at the time of the\nrestructuring in October 2007) for potential  \nlosses arising from the Visa Litigation. The  \nindemnification by the Visa U.S.A. member     \nbanks has no specific maximum amount. Using   \nproceeds from its IPO and through reductions  \nto the conversion ratio applicable to the     \nClass B shares held by Visa U.S.A. member     \nbanks, Visa Inc. has funded an escrow account \nfor the benefit of member financial           \ninstitutions to fund their indemnification    \nobligations associated with the Visa          \nLitigation. The receivable related to the     \nescrow account is classified in other         \nliabilities as a direct offset to the related \nVisa Litigation contingent liability.         \nIn October 2012, Visa signed a settlement     \nagreement to resolve class action claims      \nassociated with the multi-district interchange\nlitigation pending in the United States       \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork (the \u201cMulti-District Litigation\u201d). The   \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit  \nreversed the approval of that settlement and  \nremanded the matter to the district court.    \nThereafter, the case was split into two       \nputative class actions, one seeking damages   \n(\u201cDamages Action\u201d) and a separate class action\nseeking injunctive relief only (\u201cInjuctive    \nAction\u201d). In September 2018, Visa signed a new\nsettlement agreement, superseding the original\nsettlement agreement, to resolve the Damages  \nAction. The Damages Action settlement was     \napproved by the United States District Court  \nfor the Eastern District of New York, but is  \nnow on appeal. The Injunctive Action, which   \ngenerally seeks changes to Visa rules, is     \nstill pending.                                \nOther Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities   \nThe following table is a summary of other     \nguarantees and contingent liabilities of the  \nCompany at June 30, 2020:                     \n                                              \n  (D\u2026                              Maxi\u2026      \n  in        Coll\u2026       Car\u2026       Pote\u2026      \n  Mi\u2026        Held       Amo\u2026       Futu\u2026      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  St\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026    $      \u2013    $    67    $  9,877      \n  of                                          \n  cr\u2026                                         \n  Th\u2026                                         \n  pa\u2026           \u2013          \u2013           3      \n  bo\u2026                                         \n  ar\u2026                                         \n  Se\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026       4,995          \u2013       4,917      \n  in\u2026                                         \n  As\u2026           \u2013         76       4,990  -a  \n  sa\u2026                                         \n  Me\u2026         864        171       72,7\u2026      \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  Te\u2026                                         \n  op\u2026                                         \n  bo\u2026       2,968          \u2013       2,618      \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  gu\u2026                                         \n  Ot\u2026           \u2013         86       1,393      \n                                              \n                                              \n       The maximum potential future payments  \n       do not include loan sales where the    \n       Company provides standard              \n       representation and warranties to the   \n       buyer against losses related to loan   \n       underwriting documentation defects     \n       that may have existed at the time of   \n       sale that generally are identified     \n       after the occurrence of a triggering   \n       event such as delinquency. For these   \n  (a)  types of loan sales, the maximum       \n       potential future payments is           \n       generally the unpaid principal         \n       balance of loans sold measured at the  \n       end of the current reporting period.   \n       Actual losses will be significantly    \n       less than the maximum exposure, as     \n       only a fraction of loans sold will     \n       have a representation and warranty     \n       breach, and any losses on repurchase   \n       would generally be mitigated by any    \n       collateral held against the loans.     \n                                              \nMerchant Processing The Company, through its  \nsubsidiaries, provides merchant processing    \nservices. Under the rules of credit card      \nassociations, a merchant processor retains a  \ncontingent liability for credit card          \ntransactions processed. This contingent       \nliability arises in the event of a billing    \ndispute between the merchant and a cardholder \nthat is ultimately resolved in the            \ncardholder\u2019s favor. In this situation, the    \ntransaction is \u201ccharged-back\u201d to the merchant \nand the disputed amount is credited or        \notherwise refunded to the cardholder. If the  \nCompany is unable to collect this amount from \nthe merchant, it bears the loss for the amount\nof the refund paid to the cardholder.         \n                      \n  70    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe Company currently processes card          \ntransactions in the United States, Canada and \nEurope through wholly-owned subsidiaries and a\nnetwork of other financial institutions. In   \nthe event a merchant was unable to fulfill    \nproduct or services subject to future         \ndelivery, such as airline tickets, the Company\ncould become financially liable for refunding \nthe purchase price of such products or        \nservices purchased through the credit card    \nassociations under the charge-back provisions.\nCharge-back risk related to these merchants is\nevaluated in a manner similar to credit risk  \nassessments and, as such, merchant processing \ncontracts contain various provisions to       \nprotect the Company in the event of default.  \nAt June 30, 2020, the value of airline tickets\npurchased to be delivered at a future date    \nthrough card transactions processed by the    \nCompany was $ 9.5billion. The Company held    \ncollateral of $ 743million in escrow deposits,\nletters of credit and indemnities from        \nfinancial institutions, and liens on various  \nassets. In addition to specific collateral or \nother credit enhancements, the Company        \nmaintains a liability for its implied         \nguarantees associated with future delivery. At\nJune 30, 2020, the liability was $ 144million \nprimarily related to these airline processing \narrangements. Asset Sales The Company         \nregularly sells loans to GSEs as part of its  \nmortgage banking activities. The Company      \nprovides customary representations and        \nwarranties to GSEs in conjunction with these  \nsales. These representations and warranties   \ngenerally require the Company to repurchase   \nassets if it is subsequently determined that a\nloan did not meet specified criteria, such as \na documentation deficiency or rescission of   \nmortgage insurance. If the Company is unable  \nto cure or refute a repurchase request, the   \nCompany is generally obligated to repurchase  \nthe loan or otherwise reimburse the GSE for   \nlosses. At June 30, 2020, the Company had     \nreserved $ 19million for potential losses from\nrepresentation and warranty obligations,      \ncompared with $ 9million at December 31, 2019.\nThe Company\u2019s reserve reflects management\u2019s   \nbest estimate of losses for representation and\nwarranty obligations. The Company\u2019s repurchase\nreserve is modeled at the loan level, taking  \ninto consideration the individual credit      \nquality and borrower activity that has        \ntranspired since origination. The model       \napplies credit quality and economic risk      \nfactors to derive a probability of default and\npotential repurchase that are based on the    \nCompany\u2019s historical loss experience, and     \nestimates loss severity based on expected     \ncollateral value. The Company also considers  \nqualitative factors that may result in        \nanticipated losses differing from historical  \nloss trends. As of June 30, 2020 and December \n31, 2019, the Company had $ 11million and $   \n10million, respectively, of unresolved        \nrepresentation and warranty claims from GSEs. \nThe Company does not have a significant amount\nof unresolved claims from investors other than\nGSEs. Litigation and Regulatory Matters The   \nCompany is subject to various litigation and  \nregulatory matters that arise in the ordinary \ncourse of its business. The Company           \nestablishes reserves for such matters when    \npotential losses become probable and can be   \nreasonably estimated. The Company believes the\nultimate resolution of existing legal and     \nregulatory matters will not have a material   \nadverse effect on the financial condition,    \nresults of operations or cash flows of the    \nCompany. However, in light of the             \nuncertainties inherent in these matters, it is\npossible that the ultimate resolution of one  \nor more of these matters may have a material  \nadverse effect on the Company\u2019s results from  \noperations for a particular period, and future\nchanges in circumstances or additional        \ninformation could result in additional        \naccruals or resolution in excess of           \nestablished accruals, which could adversely   \naffect the Company\u2019s results from operations, \npotentially materially. Residential Mortgage- \nBacked Securities Litigation Starting in 2011,\nthe Company and other large financial         \ninstitutions have been sued in their capacity \nas trustee for residential mortgage\u2013backed    \nsecurities trusts. In the lawsuits brought    \nagainst the Company, the investors allege that\nthe Company\u2019s banking subsidiary, U.S. Bank   \nNational Association (\u201cU.S. Bank\u201d), as trustee\ncaused them to incur substantial losses by    \nfailing to enforce loan repurchase obligations\nand failing to abide by appropriate standards \nof care after events of default allegedly     \noccurred. The plaintiffs in these matters seek\nmonetary damages in unspecified amounts and   \nmost also seek equitable relief. Regulatory   \nMatters The Company is continually subject to \nexaminations, inquiries and investigations in \nareas of heightened regulatory scrutiny, such \nas compliance, risk management, third-party   \nrisk management and consumer protection. The  \nCompany is cooperating fully with all pending \nexaminations, inquiries and investigations,   \nany of which could lead to administrative or  \nlegal proceedings or settlements. Remedies in \nthese proceedings or settlements may include  \nfines, penalties, restitution or alterations  \nin the Company\u2019s business practices (which may\nincrease the Company\u2019s operating expenses and \ndecrease its revenue). Outlook Due to their   \ncomplex nature, it can be years before        \nlitigation and regulatory matters are         \nresolved. The Company may be unable to develop\nan estimate or range of loss where matters are\nin early stages, there are significant        \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    71  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nfactual or legal issues to be resolved,       \ndamages are unspecified or uncertain, or there\nis uncertainty as to a litigation class being \ncertified or the outcome of pending motions,  \nappeals or proceedings. For those litigation  \nand regulatory matters where the Company has  \ninformation to develop an estimate or range of\nloss, the Company believes the upper end of   \nthe range of reasonably possible losses in    \naggregate, in excess of any reserves          \nestablished for matters where a loss is       \nconsidered probable, will not be material to  \nits financial condition, results of operations\nor cash flows. The Company\u2019s estimates are    \nsubject to significant judgment and           \nuncertainties, and the matters underlying the \nestimates will change from time to time.      \nActual results may vary significantly from the\ncurrent estimates.                            \n                                \n  Note\u00a016    Business Segments  \n                                \nWithin the Company, financial performance is  \nmeasured by major lines of business based on  \nthe products and services provided to         \ncustomers through its distribution channels.  \nThese operating segments are components of the\nCompany about which financial information is  \nprepared and is evaluated regularly by        \nmanagement in deciding how to allocate        \nresources and assess performance. The Company \nhas five reportable operating segments:       \nCorporate and Commercial Banking Corporate and\nCommercial Banking offers lending, equipment  \nfinance and small-ticket leasing, depository  \nservices, treasury management, capital markets\nservices, international trade services and    \nother financial services to middle market,    \nlarge corporate, commercial real estate,      \nfinancial institution, non-profitand public   \nsector clients.                               \nConsumer and Business Banking Consumer and    \nBusiness Banking delivers products and        \nservices through banking offices, telephone   \nservicing and sales, on-lineservices, direct  \nmail, ATM processing and mobile devices. It   \nencompasses community banking, metropolitan   \nbanking and indirect lending, as well as      \nmortgage banking.                             \nWealth Management and Investment Services     \nWealth Management and Investment Services     \nprovides private banking, financial advisory  \nservices, investment management, retail       \nbrokerage services, insurance, trust, custody \nand fund servicing through four businesses:   \nWealth Management, Global Corporate Trust &   \nCustody, U.S. Bancorp Asset Management and    \nFund Services.                                \nPayment Services Payment Services includes    \nconsumer and business credit cards, stored-   \nvalue cards, debit cards, corporate,          \ngovernment and purchasing card services,      \nconsumer lines of credit and merchant         \nprocessing.                                   \nTreasury and Corporate Support Treasury and   \nCorporate Support includes the Company\u2019s      \ninvestment portfolios, funding, capital       \nmanagement, interest rate risk management,    \nincome taxes not allocated to business        \nsegments, including most investments in tax-  \nadvantagedprojects, and the residual aggregate\nof those expenses associated with corporate   \nactivities that are managed on a consolidated \nbasis.                                        \nBasis of Presentation Business segment results\nare derived from the Company\u2019s business unit  \nprofitability reporting systems by            \nspecifically attributing managed balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and    \ntheir related income or expense. The allowance\nfor credit losses and related provision       \nexpense are allocated to the business segments\naccording to the volume and credit quality of \nthe loan balances managed, but with the impact\nof changes in economic forecasts recorded in  \nTreasury and Corporate Support. Goodwill and  \nother intangible assets are assigned to the   \nbusiness segments based on the mix of business\nof an entity acquired by the Company. Within  \nthe Company, capital levels are evaluated and \nmanaged centrally; however, capital is        \nallocated to the business segments to support \nevaluation of business performance. Business  \nsegments are allocated capital on a risk-     \nadjusted basis considering economic and       \nregulatory capital requirements. Generally,   \nthe determination of the amount of capital    \nallocated to each business segment includes   \ncredit allocations following a Basel III      \nregulatory framework. Interest income and     \nexpense is determined based on the assets and \nliabilities managed by the business segment.  \nBecause funding and asset liability management\nis a central function, funds transfer-pricing \nmethodologies are utilized to allocate a cost \nof funds used or credit for funds provided to \nall business segment assets and liabilities,  \nrespectively, using a matched funding concept.\nAlso, each business unit is allocated the     \ntaxable-equivalent benefit of tax-            \nexemptproducts. The residual effect on net    \ninterest income of asset/liability management \nactivities is included in Treasury and        \nCorporate Support. Noninterest income and     \nexpenses directly managed by each business    \nsegment, including fees, service charges,     \nsalaries and benefits, and other direct       \nrevenues and costs are accounted for within   \neach segment\u2019s financial results in a manner  \nsimilar to the consolidated financial         \nstatements. Occupancy costs are allocated     \nbased on utilization of facilities by the     \nbusiness segments. Generally, operating losses\nare charged to the business segment when the  \nloss event is realized in a manner similar to \na loan charge-off.Noninterest expenses        \nincurred by centrally managed operations or   \nbusiness segments that                        \n                      \n  72    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \ndirectly support another business segment\u2019s   \noperations are charged to the applicable      \nbusiness segment based on its utilization of  \nthose services, primarily measured by the     \nvolume of customer activities, number of      \nemployees or other relevant factors. These    \nallocated expenses are reported as net shared \nservices expense within noninterest expense.  \nCertain activities that do not directly       \nsupport the operations of the business        \nsegments or for which the business segments   \nare not considered financially accountable in \nevaluating their performance are not charged  \nto the business segments. The income or       \nexpenses associated with these corporate      \nactivities is reported within the Treasury and\nCorporate Support business segment. Income    \ntaxes are assessed to each business segment at\na standard tax rate with the residual tax     \nexpense or benefit to arrive at the           \nconsolidated effective tax rate included in   \nTreasury and Corporate Support. Designations, \nassignments and allocations change from time  \nto time as management systems are enhanced,   \nmethods of evaluating performance or product  \nlines change or business segments are         \nrealigned to better respond to the Company\u2019s  \ndiverse customer base. During 2020, certain   \norganization and methodology changes were made\nand, accordingly, 2019 results were restated  \nand presented on a comparable basis.          \n                      \n

Item 1A. Risk Factors \u2014 There are a\nnumber of factors that may adversely affect   \nthe Company\u2019s business, financial results or  \nstock price. These risks are described        \nelsewhere in this report or the Company\u2019s     \nother filings with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, including the Company\u2019s Annual    \nReport on Form 10-Kfor the year ended December\n31, 2019. Additional risks that the Company   \ncurrently does not know about or currently    \nviews as immaterial may also impair the       \nCompany\u2019s business or adversely impact its    \nfinancial results or stock price. There are no\nmaterial changes from the risk factors set    \nforth under Item 1A of the Company\u2019s Annual   \nReport on Form 10-Kfor the year ended December\n31, 2019, and Part II, Item 1A, \u201cRisk         \nFactors,\u201d in the Company\u2019s Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Qfor the quarterly period ended March \n31, 2020 (the \u201cMarch 10-Q\u201d),except that the   \nfollowing risk factor replaces the risk factor\nin the March 10-Q: The Company\u2019s business,    \nfinancial condition, liquidity, capital and   \nresults of operations have been, and will     \nlikely continue to be, adversely affected by  \nthe COVID-19pandemic The COVID-19pandemic has \ncreated economic and financial disruptions    \nthat have adversely affected, and are likely  \nto continue to adversely affect, the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, financial condition, capital,       \nliquidity and results of operations. The      \nCompany cannot predict at this time the extent\nto which it will continue to be negatively    \naffected by the COVID-19pandemic. The extent  \nof any continued or future adverse effects of \nthe COVID-19pandemic will depend on future    \ndevelopments, which are highly uncertain and  \noutside the Company\u2019s control, including the  \nscope and duration of the pandemic, the direct\nand indirect impact of the pandemic on the    \nCompany\u2019s employees, customers, counterparties\nand service providers, as well as other market\nparticipants, and actions taken by            \ngovernmental authorities and other third      \nparties in response to the pandemic. If the   \npandemic is prolonged, or other diseases      \nemerge that give rise to similar effects, the \nadverse impact on the global economy and      \nCompany could deepen. Many of the Company\u2019s   \ncounterparties and third-party service        \nproviders have been, and may further be,      \naffected by \u201cstay-at-home\u201dorders, market      \nvolatility and other factors that increase    \ntheir risks of business disruption or that may\notherwise affect their ability to perform     \nunder the terms of any agreements with the    \nCompany or provide essential services. As a   \nresult, the Company\u2019s operational and other   \nrisks are generally expected to increase until\nthe pandemic subsides. In addition, the       \nCompany\u2019s business operations may be disrupted\nif significant portions of its workforce are  \nunable to work effectively, including because \nof illness, caring for dependents,            \nquarantines, government actions, or other     \nrestrictions in connection with the pandemic. \nThe Company has temporarily closed certain of \nits offices and reduced operating hours and/or\nlobby services at its branches. The Company   \nmay also face heightened cybersecurity,       \ninformation security or other operational     \nrisks resulting from alternative working      \narrangements of its employees. In response to \nthe pandemic and to support its customers, the\nCompany is offering fee waivers, payment      \ndeferrals and other expanded assistance to    \ncredit card, automobile, mortgage, small      \nbusiness and personal lending customers,      \nincluding committing in certain states in     \nwhich it operates, to suspend mortgage        \npayments and foreclosure sales for financially\nimpacted customers for certain periods of     \ntime. A significant number of the Company\u2019s   \ncustomers have already sought to suspend their\nmortgage payments under these programs.       \nSuspensions of mortgage payments and          \nforeclosures and reduced pricing under these  \nprograms may adversely affect the Company\u2019s   \nrevenue and results of operations. In         \naddition, if these or other measures provided \nby the Company are not effective in mitigating\nthe financial consequences of COVID-19on      \ncustomers, including providing loans under    \nvarious newly created government-sponsored    \nlending programs such as the Paycheck         \nProtection Program (the \u201cPPP\u201d), the Company   \nmay experience higher rates of default,       \nincreased credit losses and additional        \nincreases in its allowance for credit losses  \nin future periods. Certain industries where   \nthe Company has credit exposure, including the\ntransportation industry, and in particular air\ntravel, have experienced significant          \noperational challenges as a result of         \nCOVID-19.These negative effects have resulted \nin a number of corporate lending clients      \nmaking higher than usual draws on outstanding \nlines of credit over the last several months. \nMany of these customers have since paid down  \nthese draws, but if current economic          \nconditions persist or worsen, client draws on \noutstanding lines of credit may begin to      \nincrease again which may adversely affect the \nCompany\u2019s liquidity. The economic effects of  \nCOVID-19may also cause the Company\u2019s customers\nto be unable to pay their loans as they come  \ndue or decrease the value of collateral, which\nthe Company expects would cause significant   \nincreases in its credit losses and result in  \nadditional increases in the Company\u2019s         \nallowance for credit losses. In addition, the \nCompany could be exposed to further losses in \nits role as merchant processor of credit card \ntransactions, as under the                    \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    79  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nrules of credit card associations, a merchant \nprocessor retains a contingent liability for  \ncredit card transactions processed. In the    \nevent a merchant was unable to fulfill product\nor services subject to future delivery, such  \nas airline tickets, the Company could become  \nfinancially liable for refunding to the       \ncardholders the purchase price of such        \nproducts or services purchased through credit \ncard associations, in the event the merchant  \nwas not able to do so. Net interest income is \nsignificantly affected by market rates of     \ninterest. The significant reductions to the   \nfederal funds rate have led to a decrease in  \nthe rates and yields on U.S. Treasury         \nsecurities, in some cases declining below     \nzero. If interest rates are reduced further in\nresponse to COVID-19,the Company\u2019s net        \ninterest income could continue to decline,    \nperhaps significantly. The overall effect of  \nlower interest rates cannot be predicted at   \nthis time and depends on future actions the   \nFederal Reserve may take to increase or reduce\nthe targeted federal funds rate in response to\nthe COVID-19pandemic and resulting economic   \nconditions. The Company, through its          \nsubsidiaries, provides credit and debit card, \ncorporate payments products and merchant      \nprocessing services. Revenues from its payment\nservices businesses depend on consumer and    \nbusiness credit card spending, including at   \nmany small and medium-sizedbusinesses. Due to \nresponses to COVID-19,including stay-at-      \nhomeorders that require businesses other than \nthose defined as essential to close and for   \nconsumers to remain at home unless they are   \nengaged in essential activities, consumer and \nbusiness credit card spending significantly   \ndeclined. Although stay-at-homeorders have    \ngradually been lifted and business activity   \nhas increased, if the reopening of certain    \nnonessential businesses is delayed or closures\nreoccur or unemployment continues to rise or  \nstay at elevated levels, the Company expects  \nto experience further adverse effects on its  \npayment services businesses. This negative    \neffect could continue after the pandemic      \nsubsides if a substantial number of businesses\nwere to close permanently as a result of      \nCOVID-19\u2019seconomic effects or if consumer and \nbusiness spending were to remain depressed.   \nThe effects of the COVID-19pandemic on        \neconomic and market conditions may negatively \naffect the Company\u2019s capital and leverage     \nratios. In June 2020 the Federal Reserve      \nannounced it will require all large bank      \nholding companies to preserve capital through \nthe suspension of share repurchase programs   \nand capping common stock dividends to existing\nrates that do not exceed the average of the   \nlast four quarters\u2019 earnings. These capital   \npreservation actions apply to the third       \nquarter of 2020 but may be extended or        \nmodified by the Federal Reserve as economic   \nconditions develop. The COVID-19pandemic may  \ncause the Company to further extend the       \nsuspension of its share repurchase program and\nlimit capital distributions, including        \nreducing or suspending its common stock       \ndividend. Additionally, as a result of the    \nCOVID-19 sensitivity analysis conducted by the\nFederal Reserve, banks are required to        \nresubmit capital plans in the fourth quarter  \nof 2020 to reflect current stressed capital   \nconditions. Governmental authorities worldwide\nhave taken unprecedented measures to stabilize\nthe markets and support economic growth.      \nHowever, these measures may not be sufficient \nto address the negative economic effects of   \nCOVID-19or avert severe and prolonged         \nreductions in economic activity. Many         \nfinancial institutions, including the Company,\nhave received inquiries from the Unites States\nCongress, regulators and other government     \nagencies regarding implementation of          \nprovisions and programs under the Coronavirus \nAid, Relief, and Economic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d)  \nAct, and also are subject to early-stage      \nlitigation concerning their participation in  \nthe PPP under that Act. The Company\u2019s         \ninvolvement in these and other programs       \ncreated in response to the COVID-19pandemic   \nmay lead to additional government and         \nregulatory inquiries and litigation in the    \nfuture, any of which could negatively impact  \nthe Company\u2019s business, reputation, financial \ncondition and results of operations. Other    \nnegative effects of COVID-19and the resulting \neconomic and market disruptions, including    \ncustomer disputes, challenges of transitioning\nemployees back to the workplace, litigation   \nand governmental and regulatory scrutiny of   \nresponse actions taken by the Company, that   \nmay impact the Company\u2019s business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, liquidity, capital and   \nresults of operations cannot be predicted at  \nthis time. However, it is likely that the     \nCompany\u2019s business, financial condition,      \nliquidity, capital and results of operations  \nwill continue to be adversely affected until  \nthe pandemic subsides and the domestic economy\nrecovers. Further, the COVID-19pandemic may   \nalso have the effect of heightening many of   \nthe other risks described in the section      \nentitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in the Company\u2019s 2019 \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.Until the pandemic \nsubsides, the Company expects reduced revenues\nfrom its lending businesses, increased credit \nlosses in its lending portfolios, possible    \nadditional increases in its allowance for     \ncredit losses and decreased revenue from its  \npayments businesses. Even after the pandemic  \nsubsides, it is possible that the domestic and\nother major global economies will continue to \nexperience a prolonged recession, which the   \nCompany expects would adversely affect its    \nbusiness, financial condition, liquidity,     \ncapital and results of operations, potentially\nmaterially.
