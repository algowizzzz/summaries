All directors are elected\nannually to serve one-year terms until the\nnext annual meeting and until their successors\nare elected and qualified. Thirteen of our\ncurrent directors have been nominated for\nelection by the Board to hold office until the\n2024 annual meeting and the election of their\nsuccessors. Following 16 years of dedicated\nservice, including most recently as our\ncurrent Lead Independent Director, Olivia F.\nKirtley informed the Board after reaching age\n72 that she will retire from the Board\nfollowing expiration of her current term at\nthe 2023 annual meeting. In light of Ms.\nKirtley\u2019s retirement, the size of our Board\nwill be reduced to 13 as of our 2023 annual\nmeeting. If re-elected, Roland A. Hernandez\nwill succeed Ms. Kirtley as our Lead\nIndependent Director effective following the\n2023 annual meeting. All of the nominees\ncurrently serve on our Board. Loretta E.\nReynolds was appointed a director by the Board\nin October 2022, and Alan B. Colberg was\nappointed as a director by the Board in\nJanuary 2023, and both are standing for\nelection for the first time at the annual\nmeeting. Each of the other nominees has\npreviously been elected by our shareholders.\nThe Board has determined that, except for\nAndrew Cecere, our Chairman, President and\nChief Executive Officer, each nominee for\nelection as a director at the annual meeting\nis independent from U.S. Bancorp as discussed\nlater in this proxy statement under \u201cCorporate\nGovernance \u2014 Director Independence.\u201d Director\nselection and nomination considerations\nDirector nominee selection process The\nselection process for first-time director\ncandidates includes the following steps: \u25b6\nidentification of one or more desired profiles\nfor director candidates based on the most\nrecent assessment of the skill sets\nrepresented on the Board compared to the\nBoard\u2019s needs, as well as feedback received\nfrom the Board evaluation process; \u25b6\nidentification of candidates by the Governance\nCommittee based upon information provided by a\ndirector search firm, suggestions from current\ndirectors and executive officers, and any\nrecommendations received from shareholders and\nother sources; \u25b6 interviews of candidates by\nthe Lead Independent Director and other\ndirectors; \u25b6 reports presented to the Board by\nthe Governance Committee on the candidates and\nselection process; \u25b6 recommendations made by\nthe Governance Committee; and \u25b6 election by\nthe Board or formal nomination by the Board\nfor inclusion in the slate of directors at the\nannual meeting. During 2022, each of Ms.\nReynolds and Mr. Colberg were identified by a\nthird-party search firm engaged by the\nGovernance Committee to help identity and\nevaluate individuals for inclusion in the\npotential pool of director candidates, and\neach was appointed to the Board following the\nGovernance Committee\u2019s and Board\u2019s review and\nevaluation process. Director candidates\nrecommended by shareholders are given the same\nconsideration as candidates suggested by a\nsearch firm, directors or executive officers.\nA shareholder seeking to recommend a\nprospective candidate for the Governance\nCommittee\u2019s consideration should submit the\ncandidate\u2019s name and sufficient written\ninformation about the candidate to permit a\ndetermination by the Governance Committee of\nwhether the candidate meets the director\nselection criteria set forth in our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines. Recommendations should\nbe sent to the Chair of the Governance\nCommittee in care of the Corporate Secretary\nof U.S. Bancorp at the address listed on page\n92 of this proxy statement. Commitment to\nBoard diversity Our company is committed to\ndiversity, equity and inclusion. Our Board is\nfocused on diversity within its membership in\norder to benefit from a variety of\nperspectives, experiences and skill sets in\nexercising its oversight role. The Board\u2019s\ncommitment to diversity is reflected in our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines, which require\nthat any director search firm used to identify\nexternal candidates for a Board vacancy will\nbe requested to present a diverse slate of\ncandidates. Board refreshment and nomination\nconsiderations Our Governance Committee\ncontinuously assesses the evolving\nopportunities and challenges facing our\ncompany in order to align the Board\u2019s\ncomposition with our company\u2019s leadership\nneeds and strategic direction. The Governance\nCommittee evaluates the composition of the\nBoard against the company\u2019s needs every year,\nwhich culminates in the process of nominating\nnew and incumbent directors.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy              9    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 1 \u2014 Election of\ndirectors The Governance Committee\u2019s decision\nto renominate an incumbent director is\ninformed by the director\u2019s past attendance at\nmeetings, participation in the work of the\nBoard and overall contribution to the Board,\nas assessed in the annual Board evaluation\nprocess. The Board\u2019s commitment to refreshment\ncan require candid conversations with\nindividual directors when the Governance\nCommittee has determined that a different\nBoard composition would increase the Board\u2019s\neffectiveness. As a result of the Board\nevaluation and skills-to-strategy alignment\nprocesses, directors may decide or be asked\nnot to stand for re-election at the next\nannual meeting. When a new director is sought,\nthe Governance Committee considers the\nfollowing factors: \u25b6 Skills and\nqualifications:When considering the skills and\nbackgrounds desirable in future Board members,\nthe Governance Committee identifies the\nprofessional experience and skill sets\nrepresented on the Board and compares them to\nthe set of skills that the Governance\nCommittee believes is important to have\nrepresented among the directors at any given\ntime in light of the company\u2019s current\nstrategy, risks and opportunities. Any gaps\nbecome focus areas for director search\nefforts. See below for additional information\non our directors\u2019 skills and qualifications. \u25b6\nPersonal qualities:The Governance Committee\nwill only consider as candidates for director\nindividuals who possess the highest personal\nand professional ethics and integrity, and who\nare committed to representing the long-term\ninterests of all our shareholders. Directors\nmust be able to work in a collegial manner\nwith persons of different educational,\nbusiness and cultural backgrounds. \u25b6\nDiversity:Our Governance Committee regularly\nreviews the composition of the Board in light\nof the backgrounds, industries, skills,\nprofessional experience, geographic\ncommunities, gender, race, ethnicity and other\npersonal qualities and attributes represented\nby our current members. The Governance\nCommittee incorporates this broad view of\ndiversity into its director nomination process\nand is committed to ensuring that the Board\u2019s\ncomposition as a whole appropriately reflects\nthe current and anticipated needs of the Board\nand our company. The Governance Committee\nseeks women and people of color as candidates\nin every search effort. \u25b6 Capacity:Serving on\nthe board of a large financial institution\nrequires a significant commitment of time and\nenergy, and directors must be willing and able\nto devote sufficient attention to carrying out\ntheir duties and responsibilities effectively.\nThe Governance Committee will consider the\nprofessional and other demands placed on\ncandidates, including service on the boards of\nother public or private companies. Unless the\nBoard determines that a director\u2019s service to\nour company would not be impaired, a director\nmay not serve on more than three other boards\nof public companies in addition to our Board,\nand a director who serves as the CEO of a\npublic company may not serve on more than two\npublic company boards (including the board of\nthe company of which he or she serves as CEO).\n\u25b6 Tenure and refreshment:Our Governance\nCommittee believes that it is important to\nmaintain a balance of tenure on the Board to\nbenefit from the business, industry and\ngovernance experience of longer-serving\ndirectors and the fresh perspectives\ncontributed by new directors, while\nrecognizing the value of continuity as Board\ncomposition changes. Our Governance Committee\naims to have a measured rate of Board\nrefreshment. \u25b6 Retirement and other\nconsiderations for incumbent directors:In\naddition to the factors stated above, the\nGovernance Committee will evaluate any\ndirector\u2019s continued service on the Board for\nappropriateness in each of the following\ncircumstances: the director has a change in\nemployment or other major responsibilities, an\nemployee director ceases to be a company\nemployee, and the director has reached the age\nof 72 since the last meeting of shareholders\nat which the director was elected.

Good corporate\ngovernance is vital to our continued success.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines to provide a corporate\ngovernance framework for our directors and\nmanagement to effectively pursue our\nobjectives for the benefit of our\nshareholders. The Board reviews and updates\nthese guidelines and the charters of the Board\ncommittees at least annually in response to\nevolving best practices and business needs, as\nwell as the results of annual Board and\ncommittee evaluations.

Baxter, Dorothy J.\nBridges, Elizabeth L. Buse, Alan B. Colberg,\nKimberly N. Ellison-Taylor, Kimberly J.\nHarris, Roland A. Hernandez, Olivia F.\nKirtley, Richard P. McKenney, Yusuf I. Mehdi,\nLoretta E. Reynolds, John P. Wiehoff and Scott\nW. Wine. Andrew Cecere is not independent\nbecause he is an executive officer of U.S.\nBancorp. The Board had determined that Karen\nS. Lynch was an independent director prior to\nher retirement from the Board in April 2022.\nOur Board has adopted a set of standards in\nour Corporate Governance Guidelines to assist\nit in assessing the independence of each of\nour non-employee directors. A director of U.S.\nBancorp who meets the independence\nqualifications of the New York Stock Exchange\n(NYSE) listing standards may be deemed\n\u201cindependent\u201d by the Board of Directors after\nconsideration of the relationships between\nU.S. Bancorp or any of its affiliates and the\ndirector or any of his or her immediate family\nmembers or other related parties. Our Board\ndeems the following relationships to be\ncategorically immaterial such that they will\nnot, by themselves, affect an independence\ndetermination: \u25b6 a relationship between our\ncompany and an organization of which the\ndirector or a member of his or her immediate\nfamily is an executive officer if that role\ndoes not constitute that person\u2019s principal\noccupation; \u25b6 an ordinary banking relationship\nfor services readily available from other\nlarge financial institutions; \u25b6 employment by\nour company of a member of the director\u2019s\nimmediate family if that person\u2019s annual\ncompensation does not exceed $120,000; and \u25b6 a\nrelationship between our company and an\norganization with which the director or a\nmember of his or her immediate family is\naffiliated if (a) the relationship arises in\nthe ordinary course of both parties\u2019\noperations and (b) the aggregate annual amount\ninvolved does not exceed $120,000. The only\nrelationships between U.S. Bancorp and our\ndirectors or the directors\u2019 related interests\nthat were considered by the Board when\nassessing the independence of our non-employee\ndirectors are the relationships between U.S.\nBancorp and Microsoft Corporation, a\ncorporation with which our director Yusuf I.\nMehdi is affiliated. The Board determined that\nthese relationships, which are described later\nin this proxy statement under the heading\n\u201cRelated Person Transactions,\u201d do not impair\nMr. Mehdi\u2019s independence. This determination\nwas based on the Board\u2019s conclusion that the\namounts involved in transactions between U.S.\nBancorp and Microsoft are immaterial to\nMicrosoft\u2019s gross revenues and that the\nrelationships had no unique characteristics\nthat could influence Mr. Mehdi\u2019s impartial\njudgment as a director of U.S. Bancorp.\n                                              \n    24      U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance\n\nBoard leadership structure Board leadership\npolicies and practices Our Board believes that\na strong, independent Board of Directors is\ncritical to effective oversight of management.\nThe Board carefully considers the important\nissue of the best independent leadership\nstructure for the Board, and maintains a\nflexible policy regarding the issue of whether\nthe position of Chairman should be held by an\nindependent director. At least annually, the\nBoard reviews the Board\u2019s and company\u2019s needs\nand the leadership attributes of its directors\nand executives to determine whether our\ncompany is best served at that particular time\nby having the CEO or another director hold the\nposition of Chairman. In order to provide\nstrong independent Board leadership when the\nposition of Chairman is not held by an\nindependent director, the independent\ndirectors elect a Lead Independent Director\nwith the substantial leadership\nresponsibilities detailed below. The Lead\nIndependent Director is elected annually upon\nthe recommendation of the Governance\nCommittee, with the expectation that he or she\nwill generally serve three, and may serve up\nto five, consecutive terms. In addition, our\nLead Independent Director is empowered with,\nand exercises, robust and well-defined duties\nreflected in our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines that were most recently enhanced in\nJanuary 2022 and are summarized below. In\naddition to strong independent leadership of\nthe full Board, each of the Audit Committee,\nGovernance Committee, and Compensation and\nHuman Resources Committee is composed solely\nof independent directors. Independent\ndirectors, therefore, oversee critical, risk-\nsensitive matters such as the quality and\nintegrity of our financial statements; the\ncompensation of our executive officers,\nincluding the CEO; the nomination of\ndirectors; and the evaluation of the Board,\nits committees, and its members. Each of the\nremaining committees, aside from the Executive\nCommittee, is chaired by an independent\ndirector. The full Board and each of its\ncommittees meet in executive session on a\nregular basis. Current leadership structure\nAndrew Cecere, our President and Chief\nExecutive Officer, became Chairman of the\nBoard on the date of the 2018 annual meeting.\nOlivia F. Kirtley has served as the Board\u2019s\nIndependent Lead Director since our 2020\nannual meeting, and will retire from the Board\nfollowing expiration of her current term at\nthe 2023 annual meeting. Following the\nGovernance Committee\u2019s review of potential\ncandidates and due deliberation, the\nGovernance Committee recommended that the\nBoard appoint Roland A. Hernandez to succeed\nMs. Kirtley as Lead Independent Director upon\nher retirement, and the Board approved Mr.\nHernandez\u2019s appointment at its meeting in\nJanuary 2023. Our Board, through its annual\nassessment process, believes that the existing\nstructure continues to be the appropriate\nleadership structure for the company at this\ntime. Chairman The independent directors\nbelieve that Mr. Cecere is the member of the\nBoard best suited to contribute to long-term\nshareholder value by serving as Chairman\nbecause he has the knowledge, expertise and\nexperience to understand and clearly\narticulate to the Board the opportunities and\nrisks facing our company, which is especially\nhelpful in light of the company\u2019s acquisition\nand integration of MUFG Union Bank, and to\nlead discussions on long-term strategy and\nimportant matters affecting our business.\n                                              \n      Role of Chairman                        \n      When the Chairman is also the CEO,      \n      that person\u2019s primary                   \n      responsibilities as Chairman are        \n      as follows:                             \n      \u25b6                                       \n      set Board meeting agendas in            \n      collaboration with the Lead             \n      Independent Director, who has           \n      final approval authority over           \n      them;                                   \n      \u200b                                        \n      \u25b6                                       \n      preside at Board meetings, guiding      \n      discussion and ensuring that            \n      decisions are made;                     \n      \u200b                                        \n      \u25b6                                       \n      ensure that the Board is provided       \n      with full information on our            \n      company and its industry;               \n      \u200b                                        \n      \u25b6                                       \n      set shareholder meeting agendas,        \n      subject to approval by the Board,       \n      and preside at meetings of the          \n      shareholders; and                       \n      \u200b                                        \n      \u25b6                                       \n      chair the Board\u2019s Executive             \n      Committee.                              \n      \u200b                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy             25    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance\n\nLead Independent Director In connection with\nher service as Lead Independent Director, Ms.\nKirtley brings her deep business and board\nleadership experience, independent perspective\nand guidance, and expertise on corporate\ngovernance and other issues to the Board. As a\ncorporate governance consultant, faculty\nmember of The Conference Board Directors\u2019\nInstitute, and experienced public company\ndirector, she has a particular strength in\nunderstanding current corporate governance\nissues. She has served as Chair of the Audit\nand Risk Management Committees, and she is\ncurrently a member of the Compensation and\nHuman Resources, Governance and Executive\nCommittees. Starting in 2021, the Governance\nCommittee devoted significant time and\nattention to Board succession planning,\nincluding an appropriate and well-considered\nLead Independent Director succession plan.\nDuring the planning process, the Governance\nCommittee considered feedback received through\nthe Board\u2019s annual evaluation process,\nconsidered a number of factors, skills,\nqualifications, and attributes that the\nGovernance Committee deemed relevant in\nconnection with recommending a successor as\nLead Independent Director, and regularly\nupdated the Board as part of its planning.\nFollowing the Governance Committee\u2019s\ndeliberate review and recommendation, the\nBoard appointed Mr. Hernandez to succeed Ms.\nKirtley as Lead Independent Director upon her\nretirement.

As part of those requirements, our Board\nof Directors has determined that each member\nof the Audit Committee is financially\nliterate. All of the members of the\nCompensation and Human Resources, Governance,\nand Public Responsibility Committees also meet\nthe independence requirements of the NYSE,\nincluding, with respect to the Compensation\nand Human Resources Committee members, the\nNYSE\u2019s independence requirements specific to\nmembers of compensation committees. The Audit\nCommittee charter generally prohibits Audit\nCommittee members from serving on more than\ntwo other public company audit committees.\nCurrently, no Audit Committee member exceeds\nthis limitation. At all times, one or more\nmembers of our Audit Committee possess the\neducation or experience required to qualify as\nan \u201caudit committee financial expert\u201d as\ndefined by the SEC, and one or more members of\nour Risk Management Committee have experience\nidentifying, assessing and managing the risk\nexposures of large, complex financial firms,\nin accordance with rules promulgated by the\nFederal Reserve Board. Compensation Committee\nInterlocks and Insider Participation Warner L.\nBaxter, Kimberly J. Harris, Olivia F. Kirtley,\nKaren S. Lynch and Scott W. Wine served as\nmembers of the Compensation and Human\nResources Committee during 2022. During 2022,\nno member of the Compensation and Human\nResources Committee was an employee, officer,\nor former officer of the company. None of our\nexecutive officers served in 2022 on the board\nof directors or compensation committee (or\nother committee serving an equivalent\nfunction) of any entity that had an executive\nofficer serving as a member of our Board or\nthe Compensation and Human Resources\nCommittee. As described under the \u201cRelated\nPerson Transactions\u201d section of this proxy\nstatement, in 2022, some Compensation and\nHuman Resources Committee members had\ntransactions in the ordinary course of\nbusiness with our banking and broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries. Majority vote standard for\nelection of directors Our bylaws provide that\nin uncontested elections, a nominee for\ndirector will be elected to the Board if the\nnumber of votes cast \u201cFOR\u201d the nominee\u2019s\nelection exceeds the number of votes cast\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d that nominee\u2019s election (votes to\n\u201cABSTAIN\u201d have no effect on the election of a\ndirector). The voting standard for directors\nin a contested election is a plurality of the\nvotes cast at the meeting. Our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines provide that director\nnominees must submit a contingent resignation\nin writing to the Governance Committee, which\nbecomes effective if the director fails to\nreceive a sufficient number of votes for re-\nelection at the annual meeting of shareholders\nand the Board accepts the resignation. The\nBoard will nominate for election or re-\nelection as director only candidates who have\ntendered such a contingent resignation. Our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines further\nprovide that if an incumbent director fails to\nreceive the required vote for re-election, our\nGovernance Committee will act within 90 days\nafter certification of the shareholder vote to\ndetermine whether to accept the director\u2019s\nresignation, and will submit a recommendation\nfor prompt consideration by the Board. The\nBoard expects the director whose resignation\nis under consideration to abstain from\nparticipating in any decision regarding his or\nher resignation. The Governance Committee and\nthe Board may consider any factors they deem\nrelevant in deciding whether to accept a\ndirector\u2019s resignation.\n                                              \n    30      U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance Board\nperformance evaluations Our Governance\nCommittee conducts an annual assessment of the\nBoard\u2019s performance to determine whether the\nBoard, its committees and its members are\nfunctioning effectively and to identify areas\nfor growth and improvement. The annual process\nis as follows: Based on director feedback\nreceived over the last several years through\nthis annual evaluation process and through\nless formal channels, including feedback\nprovided by directors at meetings, management\nhas adjusted the content and style of its\nwritten materials and oral presentations for\ncommittee meetings and enhanced the director\norientation and onboarding process. In\naddition, the Governance Committee has\nreceived information about the skills and\nqualifications that directors would like\nfuture Board or committee members to have, the\ncontinued importance of diversity on the\nBoard, and topics for ongoing Board education\nas well as discussion at future Board\nmeetings. Director feedback has also led to\ndiscussion of how to appropriately balance\noversight responsibility for critical matters\naffecting our company among the Board and its\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy             31    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance\n\ncommittees, including the acquisition and\nintegration of MUFG Union Bank, and how\ncommittee action is most effectively\ncommunicated to the full Board. Director\neducation It is important for our directors to\ncontinually receive additional information and\ntraining that will help them to effectively\noversee the management of our company. We have\nimplemented a robust director education\nprogram that begins with in-depth training\ncovering our industry and each of our lines of\nbusiness, and that continues with special\neducation sessions throughout the year that\nhighlight current business, industry,\nregulatory and governance topics presented by\ninternal and external experts. Separate Board\neducation sessions held in 2022 focused on\nbusiness, strategy, and cybersecurity topics.\nDirectors are encouraged to attend continuing\ntraining sessions offered by outside providers\non topics related to general corporate\ngovernance as well as specialized areas in\nrisk management, audit, compensation and other\nmatters, at the company\u2019s expense. Management\nmakes information available to all directors\non a quarterly basis about upcoming external\ndirector education programs. Ethics and\nconduct We are deeply committed to maintaining\nthe highest standards of ethical conduct that\nreflect our purpose and core values, and which\nallow us to build trust with our customers and\nthe communities we serve. In recognition of\nthat commitment, for the eighth consecutive\nyear, we were named one of the World\u2019s Most\nEthical Companies\u00ae in 2022 by the Ethisphere\nInstitute. Our Code of Ethics and Business\nConduct, which is available on our website at\nusbank.com by clicking on \u201cAbout us\u201d,\n\u201cInvestor relations\u201d, \u201cCorporate Governance\u201d\nand then \u201cGovernance documents\u201d, outlines the\nresponsibilities of every employee and\ndirector to our customers and business\npartners, our shareholders, our community and\neach other. Succession planning and management\ndevelopment A primary responsibility of the\nBoard is planning for CEO succession, as well\nas overseeing succession planning for other\nsenior management positions. The Board\u2019s\nprocess targets the building of enhanced\nmanagement depth and skills, considers\ncontinuity and stability within our company,\nand responds to our company\u2019s evolving needs\nand changing circumstances. To achieve these\ngoals, the executive talent development and\nsuccession planning process is integrated into\nthe Board\u2019s annual activities. The Governance\nCommittee has established a CEO succession\nplanning process that considers the profile\nand skills most critical to leadership of the\ncompany, includes ongoing evaluation of a\nnumber of potential internal and external\nsuccessor candidates, and addresses emergency,\ntemporary scenarios as well as long-term\nsuccession. The CEO makes available to the\nBoard his or her recommendations and\nevaluations of potential internal successors,\nalong with a review of any development plans\nrecommended for those individuals. The\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee is\nresponsible for reviewing succession planning\nfor executive officer positions other than the\nCEO. Shareholder engagement We value the views\nof our investors and welcome feedback from\nthem. Our standard engagement practice is to\ninitiate conversations with our largest\ninvestors each fall.

Environmental,\nSocial and Governance highlights Evidencing\nour commitment to ESG matters, in 2021 we\ncreated an ESG Program Office to develop and\nmanage our ESG strategy and created an ESG-\nfocused senior operating committee dedicated\nto the integration of ESG activities into our\nbusiness strategy. We also appointed a climate\nrisk executive who works in partnership with\nthe ESG Program Office and focuses on\nidentification, measurement, monitoring, and\nmitigation of risks associated with climate\nchange. Our work is guided by three ESG\npillars: lead with core values, enable a\nsustainable future, and increase equity,\naccess and economic empowerment. In alignment\nwith these pillars, our Board and management\nhave shown a commitment to these matters by: \u25b6\nlaunching in 2021 the U.S. Bank Access\nCommitment\u2122, a long-term series of initiatives\nto address the persistent racial wealth gap\nand increase wealth building opportunities \u25b6\nannouncing in 2021 several company-wide\ncommitments to address the impacts of climate\nchange on our business, customers and\ncommunities, including: \u2022 setting a goal to\nachieve Net Zero greenhouse gas (GHG)\nemissions by 2050 \u2022 setting a goal to source\n100% renewable electricity within our\noperations by 2025 \u2022 setting an environmental\nfinance goal of $50 billion by 2030 \u2022 joining\nthe Partnership for Carbon Accounting\nFinancials (PCAF), committing to measure and\ndisclose financed emissions using PCAF\nstandards \u25b6 announcing a five-year Community\nBenefits Plan to provide $100 billion in\nloans, investments, and other support to\nbenefit low- and moderate-income borrowers and\ncommunities of color in connection with our\nacquisition of MUFG Union Bank.

Within our learning\necosystem, we offer all employees development\nresources and programs on a range of technical\nand professional topics. We also introduced\nthe One U.S. Bank leadership profile, a common\nframework to grow talent for the future. The\nframework will be used to consistently hire,\ncoach and develop talent, evaluate\nperformance, and succession plan. We also\noffer affinity-based development programs to\nprovide equitable access to development\nopportunities and launched our High Impact\nDevelopment Program, which is focused on\ngrowing our leadership pipeline of women and\nprofessionals of color. Our hiring program\nincludes the inclusion of at least one woman\nor one person of color on interview slates for\nall roles to further advance our talent and\ndiversity, equity and inclusion strategy. \u25b6\nInclusive Culture We draw strength from\ndiversity and are committed to creating an\ninclusive culture where all employees are\nvalued. Our Business Resource Groups (BRGs)\nare foundational to our culture and provide\nemployees the opportunity to network, learn,\ndevelop new leadership skills, and contribute\nto our company and communities. Our 10 BRGs\npropel accountability for diversity and\ninclusion at all levels within our\norganization. We also value our employees\u2019\nopinions and use their feedback in a variety\nof ways at all levels of the organization to\nimprove our company, customer and employee\nexperiences. One of our cornerstone programs\nis Your Voice Matters: Talk to Us through\nwhich all employees are given an opportunity\nto provide feedback on an ongoing basis on a\nvariety of topics, which allows us to be\nresponsive to feedback and measure employee\nsentiment and engagement. \u25b6 Compensation and\nBenefits Maintaining competitive compensation\nand benefits practices aligns with our core\nvalues of putting people first, powering\npotential, and staying a step ahead. In 2022,\nthe company made significant compensation\ninvestments in the workforce, including\nincreasing the minimum base hourly wage from\n$15 to $20 per hour for U.S. employees and\nimplementing targeted off-cycle compensation\nincreases to certain employee groups globally\nto improve competitive compensation and\naddress escalating inflationary pressures.\nMore than 50% of our employees were positively\nimpacted by these actions in 2022. To ensure\nemployees are compensated fairly, we have\nprocesses in place to address gender and\nracial pay inequities and conduct periodic\nreviews of employee pay levels across gender\nand racial categories with the help of an\nindependent third-party consultant. In our\n2022 review, on average, employees of the\ncompany in the U.S. who are women were paid\ngreater than 99% of what their male\ncounterparts were paid, and employees of the\ncompany in the U.S. who are people of color\nwere paid greater than 99% of what their white\ncounterparts were paid, taking into account\nseveral factors including comparable jobs,\nexperience, and location. The 2022 review did\nnot include employees from the MUFG Union Bank\nacquisition who joined the company on December\n1, 2022. We believe that comprehensive\nbenefits programs are essential to attracting\nand retaining employees. In 2022, the company\nfocused on minimizing increases to employee\nbenefit costs and materially enhanced parental\nleave, fertility, and part-time employee\nbenefits to further support our employees\u2019\nevolving needs. We also maintain an active\ncash balance pension program for which newly\nhired employees are eligible along with a\n401(k) matching program.\n                                              \n    34      U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Corporate governance\nRecognition We are proud to be recognized for\nour commitment to ethical business conduct.

The\nmanagement-level risk oversight structure is\nrobust. Our company relies on comprehensive\nrisk management processes to identify,\naggregate and measure, manage, and monitor\nrisks. This system enables the Board of\nDirectors to establish a mutual understanding\nwith management of the effectiveness of our\ncompany\u2019s risk management practices and\ncapabilities, to review our company\u2019s risk\nexposure and to elevate certain key risks for\ndiscussion at the Board level. A framework\nexists to account for the introduction of\nemerging risks or any increase in risks\nroutinely taken, which would either be largely\ncontrolled by the risk limits in place or\nidentified through the frequent risk reporting\nthat occurs throughout our company. The\nExecutive Risk Committee, which is chaired by\nour Chief Risk Officer and includes the CEO\nand other members of the executive management\nteam, oversees execution against the Risk\nManagement Framework and company-level Risk\nAppetite Statement.

Except as described below,\nthe policy requires the Governance Committee\nof the Board to review and evaluate and either\napprove or disapprove all transactions or\nseries of transactions in which: \u25b6 the amount\ninvolved will, or may be expected to, exceed\n$120,000 in any fiscal year; \u25b6 our company is\nor will be a participant; and \u25b6 a related\nperson has a direct or indirect interest. The\nBoard has determined that the Governance\nCommittee does not need to review or approve\ncertain transactions even if the amount\ninvolved will exceed $120,000, including the\nfollowing transactions: \u25b6 lending and other\nfinancial services transactions or\nrelationships that are in the ordinary course\nof business and non-preferential, and comply\nwith applicable laws; \u25b6 transactions in which\nthe related person\u2019s interest derives solely\nfrom his or her services as a director of,\nand/or his or her ownership of less than ten\npercent of the equity interest (other than a\ngeneral partner interest) in, another\ncorporation or organization that is a party to\nthe transaction; \u25b6 transactions in which the\nrelated person\u2019s interest derives solely from\nhis or her ownership of a class of equity\nsecurities of our company and all holders of\nthat class of equity securities received the\nsame benefit on a pro rata basis; \u25b6\ntransactions where the rates or charges\ninvolved are determined by competitive bids,\nor that involve the rendering of services as a\ncommon or contract carrier, or public utility,\nat rates or charges fixed in conformity with\nlaw or governmental authority; and \u25b6\nemployment and compensation arrangements for\nany executive officer and compensation\narrangements for any director, provided that\nsuch arrangements have been approved by the\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee.\nWhen considering whether to approve or ratify\na transaction, the Governance Committee will\nconsider facts and circumstances that it deems\nrelevant to its determination, including: \u25b6\nthe nature and extent of the related person\u2019s\ninterest in the transaction; \u25b6 whether the\ntransaction is on substantially the same terms\nas those prevailing at the time for comparable\ntransactions with persons not affiliated with\nour company; \u25b6 the materiality of the\ntransaction to each party; \u25b6 whether our\ncompany\u2019s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct\ncould be implicated, including whether the\ntransaction would create a conflict of\ninterest or appearance of a conflict of\ninterest; \u25b6 whether the transaction is in the\nbest interest of our company; and \u25b6 in the\ncase of a non-employee director, whether the\ntransaction would impair his or her\nindependence. No director is allowed to\nparticipate in the deliberations or vote on\nthe approval or ratification of a transaction\nif that director is a related person with\nrespect to the transaction under review. On an\nannual basis, the Governance Committee\nassesses all ongoing relationships with\nrelated persons to confirm that the\ntransactions are still appropriate.\n                                              \n    40      U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Certain relationships and\nrelated transactions Related person\ntransactions Lending transactions During 2022,\nU.S. Bancorp and our banking and broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries engaged in transactions in the\nordinary course of business with some of our\ndirectors, executive officers and the persons\nthat we know beneficially owned more than 5%\nof our common stock on December 31, 2022, and\nthe entities with which they are associated.\nAll loans and loan commitments and any\ntransactions involving other financial\nproducts and services in connection with these\ntransactions were made in the ordinary course\nof business, on substantially the same terms,\nincluding current interest rates and\ncollateral, as those prevailing at the time\nfor comparable transactions with others not\nrelated to our banking and broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries and did not involve more than the\nnormal risk of collectability or present other\nunfavorable features. Transactions with\nentities affiliated with directors or\nexecutive officers Our director Yusuf I. Mehdi\ncurrently serves as a Corporate Vice President\nof the Windows and Devices Group at Microsoft\nCorporation. The company obtains services in\nthe ordinary course of business from\nMicrosoft, including desktop software, server\nand cloud enrollment, and support and\ndevelopment of products. During 2022, the\ncompany paid approximately $53 million to\nMicrosoft for those services. In addition,\nprior to the closing of the MUFG Union Bank\nacquisition, MUFG Union Bank and its former\naffiliates obtained services in the ordinary\ncourse of business from Microsoft, including\ndesktop software, operating systems and\nsupport for products. We also entered into a\nrelationship with Microsoft in 2021 to\npurchase certain cloud computing services. The\nrelationship consists of a cloud services\ncontract with a 6-year term and a variable\npayment amount based on our cloud service\nusage, and a 3-year implementation and\nmigration contract with fixed costs that are\ntied to achievement of milestones and paid\nover the course of the contract. The aggregate\ntotal payments over the term of the cloud\nservices relationship are expected to be\nbetween $200 million and $300 million. Any\namounts paid for the cloud computing services\nin 2022 have been deducted from existing\ncredits with Microsoft. As a result, no actual\npayments were made under the contract in 2022.\nThe amounts paid for all of these Microsoft\nproducts and services, in the aggregate, are\nless than 2% of each companies\u2019 total revenue.\nThe annual revenue of Microsoft in fiscal year\n2022 was approximately $198 billion. Since\nDecember 30, 2022, U.S. Bank has employed Anne\nSt.Clair, the sister of one of our executive\nofficers (James B. Kelligrew), in a Wealth\nManagement advisor role which is a non-\nexecutive and non-strategic position. Her\nannual base compensation is $260,000. Under\nthe terms of her offer, she also will receive\na one-time cash award of $140,000 in 2023 to\ncompensate her for amounts forfeited from her\nprior employer. She is eligible to participate\nfor 2023 in annual business line and long-term\nincentive plans applicable to employees in\nsimilar Wealth Management roles. The annual\nincentive plan is primarily commission based.\nIn addition, she receives employee benefits\ngenerally available to our employees. The\ncompany established her compensation\nconsistent with our compensation practices\napplicable to employees in similar positions\nwith equivalent qualifications and\nresponsibilities. These transactions were\nconducted at an arm\u2019s length in the ordinary\ncourse of business by each party to the\ntransactions. As discussed above under the\nheading \u201cDirector Independence,\u201d the Board of\nDirectors has determined that the amounts\ninvolved in the transactions between U.S.\nBancorp and Microsoft, as the case may be, are\nimmaterial to Microsoft\u2019s gross revenues, and\nthat the relationships had no unique\ncharacteristics that could influence Mr.\nMehdi\u2019s impartial judgment, and that Mr. Mehdi\nis an independent director.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy             41    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 2 \u2014 Advisory vote\non executive compensation\n\nProposal 2 \u2014 Advisory vote on executive\ncompensation Executive compensation is an\nimportant matter to us. We are asking our\nshareholders to provide advisory approval of\nthe compensation of our executive officers\nnamed in the Summary Compensation Table, as we\nhave described it in the \u201cCompensation\nDiscussion and Analysis\u201d and \u201cExecutive\nCompensation\u201d sections of this proxy\nstatement. This proposal, commonly known as a\n\u201cSay-on-Pay\u201d proposal, gives our shareholders\nthe opportunity to express their views on the\ncompensation of our named executive officers\n(NEOs) in accordance with Section 14A of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the Exchange Act). We have been conducting\nannual advisory votes to approve executive\ncompensation since 2009 and expect to conduct\nthe next advisory vote at our 2024 annual\nmeeting of shareholders. We have designed our\nexecutive compensation program to create long-\nterm shareholder value by attracting and\nretaining talented leaders and rewarding them\nfor top performance. Our company is presenting\nthis proposal, which gives you as a\nshareholder the opportunity to endorse or not\nendorse our executive pay program by voting\n\u201cFOR\u201d or \u201cAGAINST,\u201d or abstaining from voting\non, the following resolution: \u201cRESOLVED, that\nthe shareholders approve, on an advisory\nbasis, the compensation of the named executive\nofficers, as discussed and disclosed pursuant\nto Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including in\nthe Compensation Discussion and Analysis\nsection, the compensation tables and the\nrelated disclosure contained in this proxy\nstatement.\u201d As discussed in the \u201cCompensation\nDiscussion and Analysis\u201d section below, the\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee of\nthe Board of Directors believes that the\ncompensation of our NEOs in 2022 was\nreasonable and appropriate, reflected the\nperformance of our company and the individual\nperformance of each NEO, and aligned our\nexecutives\u2019 interests with those of our\nshareholders to support long-term value\ncreation. This vote is not intended to address\nany specific item of compensation, but rather\nour overall compensation policies and\nprocedures relating to our NEOs described in\nthis proxy statement. Accordingly, your vote\nwill not directly affect or otherwise limit\nany existing compensation or award arrangement\nof any of our NEOs. Because your vote is\nadvisory, it will not be binding upon the\nBoard of Directors. However, the Board values\nour shareholders\u2019 opinions, and the\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee\nwill take into account the outcome of the vote\nwhen considering future executive compensation\narrangements.\n                                              \n        \u200b                             FOR      \n        The Board of Directors                \n        recommends that you vote              \n        \u201cFOR\u201d approval of the                 \n        compensation of our named             \n        executive officers, as                \n        disclosed in this proxy               \n        statement.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n    42      U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 3 \u2014 Advisory vote\non frequency of future advisory votes on\nexecutive compensation\n\nProposal 3 \u2014 Advisory vote on frequency of\nfuture advisory votes on executive\ncompensation In addition to the advisory\napproval of our executive compensation program\nin Proposal 2, we are seeking an advisory vote\nfrom you as a shareholder regarding the\nfrequency with which shareholders should have\nan opportunity to have an advisory vote on our\nexecutive compensation program. We are\nproviding you the option of selecting a\nfrequency of every \u201c1 YEAR,\u201d \u201c2 YEARS,\u201d or \u201c3\nYEARS,\u201d or you may abstain from voting. Our\nshareholders were last provided with the\nopportunity to vote on the frequency of\nadvisory votes on our executive compensation\nprogram in 2017. At that time, our\nshareholders opted for an annual vote. Based\non the results of the 2017 vote, our Board of\nDirectors adopted a policy to hold an annual\nadvisory vote on our executive compensation\nprogram. Since the time of our initial\nfrequency vote, it has become a widely\naccepted practice to hold the advisory vote on\nexecutive compensation annually, and we have\nfound that an annual vote facilitates\nshareholder engagement on executive\ncompensation matters. We therefore recommend\nthat you select \u201c1 YEAR\u201d when voting on the\nfrequency of advisory votes on executive\ncompensation. Although this vote, which is\nrequired pursuant to Section 14A of the\nExchange Act, is non-binding, our Board of\nDirectors values the opinions of our\nshareholders and will consider the outcome of\nthe vote when determining the frequency of\nfuture advisory votes on executive\ncompensation. A frequency vote similar to this\none will occur at least once every six years.\n                                              \n        \u200b                          1 YEAR      \n        The Board of Directors                \n        recommends that you                   \n        vote \u201c1 YEAR\u201d for the                 \n        frequency of future                   \n        advisory votes on                     \n        executive                             \n        compensation.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy             43    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nCompensation discussion and analysis This\nsection explains how we compensated the\nindividuals who served as our CEO or CFO for\n2022 and each of our three other most highly\ncompensated executive officers for 2022 (our\nnamed executive officers, or NEOs).

overview\nProgram structure in 2022 Our Compensation and\nHuman Resources Committee (referred to herein\nas the Committee) considers the views of our\nshareholders, along with industry trends and\nthe specific strategy of our company, when\ndesigning our executive compensation program.\nThe Committee considers the high level of\nsupport for our recent Say on Pay votes \u2014 over\n92% in each of the last five years \u2014 as a\ncontinuing endorsement from our shareholders\nthat our executive compensation program is\nstructured effectively. In light of this\nsustained level of shareholder support, the\nCommittee did not make any structural changes\nto our executive compensation program as a\nresult of the 2022 Say on Pay vote. 2022\nperformance-based compensation results Our\n2022 compensation outcomes reflect our pay for\nperformance philosophy, demonstrated through\nincentives earned based on achievement levels\nrelative to goals designed to focus on long-\nterm shareholder value creation. \u25b6 Payouts for\nNEOs\u2019 2022 annual cash incentive awards ranged\nfrom 114.3% to 122.7% of their respective\ntarget amounts, based on strong earnings per\nshare (EPS) and business line pretax income\nresults for the year. The Committee made\nupwards performance adjustments to three NEO\u2019s\ncash incentive awards related primarily to\ntheir significant individual contributions to\nthe closing of the MUFG Union Bank\nacquisition. \u25b6 The PRSUs granted in 2020 were\nearned at 119.1% of the NEO\u2019s respective\ntarget amounts, based on absolute and relative\nreturn on equity (ROE) results for 2020-2022.\nOur ROE performance was consistently in the\ntop-quartile relative to the peer group during\nthat period. Corporate financial performance\nIn 2022, our company continued to demonstrate\nits financial strength and diversified\nbusiness model by maintaining its sound credit\nquality and strong capital and liquidity\nposition, while continuing to invest in key\nbusiness initiatives to drive future growth.\nOn December 1, 2022, we successfully completed\nthe acquisition of MUFG Union Bank, which\nmeaningfully increased our market share in\nCalifornia by adding approximately one million\nconsumer, 700 commercial, and 190,000 business\nbanking customers. Credit quality remains\nstrong as we prudently manage credit\nunderwriting with a through-the-cycle view and\ncontinue to maintain healthy capital and\nliquidity levels given the uncertain economic\nenvironment.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy             45    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nElements of total direct compensation Sound\ncompensation practices Our executive\ncompensation program incorporates many strong\ngovernance features:\n                                              \n        What we do                            \n        Significant majority of each          \n        executive officer\u2019s                   \n        compensation is at risk               \n        \u200b                                      \n        We may cancel unvested equity         \n        awards and reduce cash                \n        incentive compensation for            \n        executives who demonstrate            \n        inadequate sensitivity to risk        \n        \u200b                                      \n        Our clawback policy allows us         \n        to recoup annual cash                 \n        incentive payouts attributable        \n        to incorrectly reported               \n        earnings                              \n        \u200b                                      \n        We have meaningful stock              \n        ownership and                         \n        hold-until-retirement                 \n        requirements                          \n        \u200b                                      \n        The Committee retains an              \n        independent compensation              \n        consultant that provides no           \n        other services to our company         \n        \u200b                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n        What we don\u2019t do                      \n        No employment or                      \n        change-in-control agreements          \n        for our executive officers            \n        \u200b                                      \n        We do not permit executive            \n        officers to hedge or pledge           \n        their company stock                   \n        \u200b                                      \n        No single-trigger accelerated         \n        vesting of equity awards upon         \n        a change-in-control of the            \n        company                               \n        \u200b                                      \n        No tax gross-ups (except in           \n        relation to relocation                \n        expenses)                             \n        \u200b                                      \n        No dividends paid on unearned         \n        PRSUs; dividend equivalents           \n        accrued on earned PRSUs are           \n        not paid until the awards vest        \n        \u200b                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n    46      U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis Philosophy and objectives of our\nexecutive compensation program Compensation\nprogram objective The Committee has structured\nour executive compensation program to create\nlong-term shareholder value by attracting and\nretaining talented leaders and rewarding them\nfor top performance. The Committee achieves\nthis objective through a compensation program\nthat: \u25b6 links a significant portion of total\ncompensation to corporate and business line\nperformance metrics, which we believe serves\nto create long-term shareholder value; \u25b6\nprovides total compensation that is market\ncompetitive, permitting us to hire and retain\nhigh-caliber individuals; \u25b6 emphasizes long-\nterm, stock-based compensation, encouraging\nour executive officers to think and act as\nlong-term shareholders; \u25b6 subjects equity\nawards to multi-year performance, vesting and\nretention requirements that enhance executive\nownership and encourage a long-term view of\ncorporate achievement; and \u25b6 encourages an\nappropriate sensitivity to risk on the part of\nsenior management, which protects long-term\nshareholder interests. Pay for performance We\noperate in a highly complex business\nenvironment and compete with both well-\nestablished financial institutions and also\nwith non-banks. Our long-term business\nobjective is to maximize shareholder value by\nconsistently delivering superior returns on\ncommon equity that exceed the cost of equity.\nIf we are successful in achieving this\nobjective, the Committee believes the results\nwill benefit our shareholders. Accordingly,\nour executive compensation program is designed\nto reward our executives for achieving annual\nand long-term financial results that further\nour long-term business objectives. \u25b6 The\nannual cash incentive plan rewards performance\nrelative to corporate EPS and business line\npretax income targets established at the\nbeginning of the fiscal year, with\nconsideration of qualitative factors to\nsupport alignment with additional corporate\npriorities. \u25b6 NEOs earn PRSUs based on\nachievement of ROE targets over a three-year\nperiod, which directly measure the return\ngenerated by the company on shareholders\u2019\ninvestment. \u25b6 The ultimate value of both the\nPRSUs and RSUs earned depends on our long-term\nfinancial success, as reflected in the price\nof our common stock. At the same time, the\nCommittee carefully weighs the risks inherent\nin our executive compensation program against\nthe program\u2019s goals and the company\u2019s risk\nappetite. Additional discussion of the risk\noversight undertaken by the Committee can be\nfound below under \u201cDecision Making and\nPolicies \u2014 Risk Considerations.\u201d Pay levels\nWhen determining executive compensation levels\neach year, the Committee considers the value\nof each compensation element as well as the\nvalue of the total direct compensation\npackage. Key factors that inform pay levels\ninclude the following: \u25b6 a review of market\ndata and the competitive landscape, which\nincludes our complexity and size relative to\nour peer institutions and the comparability of\nour NEOs\u2019 responsibilities to corresponding\nroles at peer institutions; \u25b6 the performance,\nexperience and expertise of the executive,\nincluding expanded scope of responsibilities\nwhen applicable; \u25b6 internal pay equity within\nthe executive officer group; \u25b6 the company\u2019s\nstrategy and performance; \u25b6 business line\nperformance as applicable for NEOs; \u25b6\ncompensation actions applicable to the broader\nemployee base; and \u25b6 key talent succession\nplanning and retention considerations.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy             47    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nCompensation elements Our NEOs\u2019 total direct\ncompensation consists of three elements: \u25b6\nBase salary; \u25b6 Annual cash incentive awards;\nand \u25b6 Long-term incentive compensation\n(comprising 60% PRSUs and 40% RSUs). Base\nsalary Base salary is the only component of\nthe NEOs\u2019 total direct compensation that is\nnot at risk. The Committee considers the\nsalary of executive officers relative to\ncomparable executives in our compensation peer\ngroup and may make market-based adjustments as\nit deems appropriate. Salaries can also be\nadjusted to reflect experience and tenure in a\nposition, internal pay equity within the\nexecutive officer group, promotions or\nincreased scope of responsibilities,\nindividual performance, and retention\nconsiderations. 2022 salary actions: The\nCommittee adjusted each of the NEOs\u2019 base\nsalaries in 2022 primarily to reflect\ncompetitive market conditions.

In\naddition, both EPS and pretax income are used\nacross the organization for cash bonus payout\ncalculations, and the Committee believes that\nusing these measures in executive officer\nincentive award calculations supports\nalignment with their areas of responsibility.\nBoth the Corporate Result and Business Line\nResult are assessed relative to targets\nincluded in our company\u2019s annual financial\nplan. The Board establishes these financial\ntargets at the beginning of the fiscal year\nwith the intent that they represent\nchallenging, yet achievable, goals. Under the\nAEIP, the Committee has the authority to\nadjust results to exclude the effect of\ncertain events.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy             49    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis The Final Bonus Funding Percentage is\ncalculated as follows: \u25b6 Corporate Result:The\npercentage by which corporate EPS differs from\nthe EPS target is multiplied by a leverage\nfactor to magnify the positive or negative\nvariation from the results, yielding the\nCorporate Result. A leverage factor of 2:1 is\napplied to corporate achievement of EPS goals\nbetween 80% and 120% of target. For any amount\nby which corporate achievement of EPS goals is\nless than 80% or more than 120%, the leverage\nfactor is 1:1. \u2713 The target level of EPS set\nby the Committee for 2022 was $4.18. \u25b6\nBusiness Line Result:A payout component is\ncalculated for each business line based on the\npercentage by which the business line\u2019s pretax\nincome varies from target, using the same\nleverage factor as is applied to corporate\nperformance. For executives with leadership\nresponsibilities for the entire company,\nincluding Messrs. Cecere and Dolan, or for\nthose with a corporate-wide support function,\nincluding Mr. von Gillern, the Business Line\nResult is based on the weighted average of the\npretax income results of all the company\u2019s\nbusiness lines. For executives who lead a\nrevenue-producing group, including Ms. Kedia\nand Mr. Welsh, the Business Line Result is\nbased on the weighted average pretax income\nresults of the business lines within the group\nthat the executive leads. \u25b6 Each of the\nCorporate Result and the Business Line Result\nis multiplied by 50% and then added together\nto arrive at the Formulaic Bonus Funding\nPercentagefor each Named Executive Officer. \u25b6\nThe Committee performs a Qualitative Reviewof\nthe Formulaic Bonus Funding Percentage, which\nincludes a holistic assessment of performance\non key strategic priorities, as described\nbelow. The results of the Committee\u2019s\nassessment of these additional performance\nfactors allows the Committee to adjust the\nformulaic bonus calculation by up to 25%\n(either positively or negatively) to create\ngreater alignment with overall organizational\nperformance if appropriate. 2022 Corporate\nResult: The Corporate Result was 114.9% and\nwas calculated as follows: \u25b6 The target level\nof EPS set by the Committee for 2022 was\n$4.18.The 2022 EPS target was set for the\nlegacy U.S. Bancorp excluding the impact of\nthe acquisition of MUFG Union Bank. \u25b6 The\ncompany reported EPS results of $3.69, which\nthe Committee adjusted upward by $0.80 for\npurposes of the corporate result to account\nfor notable items, including the MUFG Union\nBank acquisition in December 2022 and loan\nloss reserve variation as described below. \u25b6\nThe resulting adjusted EPS value used to\ncalculate the Corporate Result was $4.49.\n                                              \n    50      U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\n\u25b6 The Corporate Result of 114.9% was the\noutcome after applying the leverage factor to\nthe percentage difference between target and\nadjusted EPS results. Funding and Payout of\nCorporate Result For purposes of computing the\nFormulaic Bonus Funding Percentage for the\nCorporate Result, the Committee adjusts actual\nreported EPS to (i) remove the impact of any\nvariation in our loan loss reserve build or\nrelease on an after-tax basis, while including\nnet charge-offs to capture actual credit\nlosses experienced and (ii) normalize any\nnotable items that impacted EPS during the\nperformance year. The Committee established\nits approach to adjusting for variation in our\nloan loss reserve in 2020 in connection with\nour adoption of the Current Expected Credit\nLosses (CECL) accounting standard in January\n2020. Our adoption of CECL creates the\npotential for significant accounting\nvolatility and uncertainty with respect to the\nloan loss reserve that is often dependent upon\na number of judgmental factors and economic\nassumptions. In an effort to measure\nperformance based on actual credit losses, the\ncompany excludes changes in the allowance\ndriven by these factors and includes net\ncharge-offs in the determination. For 2022,\nthis calculation resulted in an upward\nadjustment to our reported EPS of $0.17. It\nhas also been the Committee\u2019s practice to\nadjust for notable items that are unusual or\nrelated to acquisitions. In 2022, the EPS\nresult was adjusted upward by $0.76 to exclude\nthe impact of merger and integration charges\nassociated with the MUFG Union Bank\nacquisition. The Committee also made downward\nadjustments for the MUFG Union Bank\ncontribution of $0.03 per diluted share and\n$0.10 per diluted share to reduce the benefit\nof the significantly rising interest rates.\nThe Committee adjustments resulted in a total\nCorporate Result EPS of $4.49. 2022 Business\nLine Results: The Business Line Result was\n110.5%, which was calculated as follows: \u25b6 For\n2022, pretax income results, inclusive of the\nregular adjustments relating to loan loss\nreserves and CECL described above and\nadjustments for notable items related to the\nMUFG Union Bank acquisition, ranged from 78.4%\nto 122.1% of target performance across our\ncompany\u2019s 17 revenue-producing business lines.\n\u25b6 These results generated Business Line\nResults of 58.4% to 142.1% following\napplication of the leverage factor and the 0%\nfloor and 200% ceiling. \u25b6 The weighted average\nBusiness Line Result of all business lines was\n110.5%. For purposes of computing the\nFormulaic Bonus Funding Percentage for the\nBusiness Line Result, pretax income includes a\ncomponent for changes in the loan loss reserve\ndriven by loan balances and changes in loan\nportfolio credit quality. The Committee\nadjusts these results so that the effect of\nany variation in our loan loss reserve build\nor release driven by such changes in loan\nportfolio credit quality is reduced by 50%.\nThe Committee believes that this adjustment\nserves to align bonus funding with changes in\ncredit quality while reducing some of the\nvolatility caused by variable judgmental\nfactors. The Committee applies these\nadjustments for loan loss reserve variation\nconsistently, whether the ultimate impact is\npositive or negative, and believes that such\nadjustments maintain accountability for credit\nquality.

For 2022, the\nQualitative Review focused on the Committee\u2019s\nassessment of performance relative to key\nstrategic initiatives, including the MUFG\nUnion Bank acquisition, company-wide\ntransformation initiatives, ESG and community-\nrelated\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy             51    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis initiatives such as our environmental\ncommitments and improvements in ESG reporting\nand disclosure, diversity, equity and\ninclusion initiatives such as internal human\ncapital management and our commitments under\nU.S. Bank Access Commitment\u2122, as well as\ncontinued strong focus on risk management and\ncompliance. 2022 Qualitative Review actions:\nBased on its assessment of corporate\nperformance and the factors noted above, the\nCommittee decided not to make any qualitative\nadjustments to the formulaic bonus funding\npercentage outcome for 2022. In making this\ndecision, the Committee determined that the\nformulaic outcomes appropriately recognized\nthe performance of the company in 2022. The\nCommittee recognized that strong progress was\nmade in connection with the successful closing\nof the MUFG Union Bank acquisition, internal\ntransformation efforts, the announcement of a\nsignificant Community Benefits Plan, and the\ncompany\u2019s Net Zero and other environmental\ncommitments, but decided to focus on targeted\nindividual performance adjustments to\nrecognize significant contributions toward\nthese goals rather than make a broader\nqualitative adjustment to company incentive\nfunding levels. Factoring in individual\nperformance and risk sensitivity The Committee\nconsiders the performance of the business\nlines managed by each executive officer and\nthat executive officer\u2019s individual\nperformance during the year. The Committee\nalso uses a formal \u201crisk scorecard\u201d assessment\nwhich, together with the individual\nperformance assessment, can result in downward\nor upward adjustments to each NEO\u2019s Bonus\nFunding Award Percentage to reflect that\nexecutive\u2019s demonstrated sensitivity to risk.\nThe Committee believes that it is important to\nretain the ability to recognize outstanding\nindividual performance and risk mitigation in\ndetermining Annual Cash Incentive Payouts, as\nwell as to acknowledge circumstances where\nindividual performance improvements are\nsuggested or where inappropriate risk-taking\nbehaviors have occurred. Modifications to our\nNEOs\u2019 Bonus Funding Award Percentage based on\ntheir individual performance and risk\nsensitivity have been used only occasionally,\nhowever, and have historically been modest in\nscope. 2022 individual performance and risk\nsensitivity actions :In connection with its\nconsideration of individual performance for\n2022, the Committee applied positive\nindividual performance adjustments of 10% to\nthe final bonus funding percentage for each of\nMessrs. Cecere, Dolan and von Gillern, in\nlight of the significance of each executive\u2019s\nindividual contributions to the MUFG Union\nBank acquisition closing and organizational\ntransformation work. For Mr. Cecere in\nparticular, the Committee considered his\ncritical involvement in working to ensure\nsuccessful closing of the MUFG Union Bank\nacquisition, as well as his strong leadership\nin driving our transformation. Historically,\nthe Committee has been selective in applying\ndiscretionary adjustments to NEO incentive\nawards, as the Committee has made only one\nother NEO individual performance adjustment in\nthe past five years. Following an analysis of\neach NEO\u2019s risk scorecard results, the\nCommittee did not make any risk-based\nmodifications to the NEOs\u2019 Final Bonus Funding\nPercentages. 2022 Annual Cash Incentive Payout\nresults: The resulting payouts made to the\nNEOs in March 2023 for 2022 performance under\nthe AEIP were as follows:\n                                              \n    52      U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nLong-term incentive awards Establishing the\nstructure of the equity awards Long-term,\nequity-based compensation represents the most\nsignificant portion of our NEOs\u2019 total\ncompensation package. The Committee uses\nequity awards to align the NEOs\u2019 interests\nwith those of long-term shareholders. In 2022,\n65% of our CEO\u2019s target total direct\ncompensation and between 62% and 65% of our\nother NEOs\u2019 target total direct compensation\nconsisted of equity awards. The Committee\ngrants equity awards to executive officers\nunder the U.S. Bancorp 2015 Stock Incentive\nPlan. In 2022, 60% of the value of each\nexecutive officer\u2019s long-term incentive award\nwas granted in the form of PRSUs that will\ncliff vest (if earned) on the third\nanniversary of the grant date, following a\nthree-year performance period, and 40% was\ngranted in the form of RSUs that vest ratably\nover three years from the date of grant. Cash\ndividends on unvested PRSUs accrue during the\nperformance period but are only paid at\nvesting on shares earned, if any, by the\nexecutives. The mix of performance-based and\ntime-based equity awards, with the mix more\nheavily weighted toward performance-based\nequity, is designed to motivate achievement of\nfinancial objectives while encouraging\nretention and stock ownership. Setting the\nvalue of the equity awards Each year in\nJanuary, the Committee determines the dollar\nvalue of the long-term incentive awards to be\ngranted to the executive officers, with the\ngrants being made on a pre-determined date in\nFebruary or March. In setting each year\u2019s\naward amounts, the Committee considers the\nrelative market position of the awards and the\ntotal compensation for each executive, the\nproportion of each executive\u2019s total direct\ncompensation to be delivered as a long-term\nincentive award, internal pay equity,\nexecutive performance and changes in\nresponsibility, retention, and corporate\nperformance. 2022 equity value actions: The\nCommittee increased the value of the long-term\nincentive awards granted to the NEOs in 2022\nto align those NEOs\u2019 total compensation more\nclosely with the opportunities available to\nexecutives in similar roles at companies in\nour peer group.\n                                              \n               Va\u2026               Va\u2026          \n               of\u2026               of\u2026          \n               aw\u2026               aw\u2026          \n               in                in           \n    NEO        20\u2026               20\u2026          \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n    An\u2026        $    9,\u2026          $    1\u2026      \n    Ce\u2026                                       \n    Te\u2026                                       \n    R.         $    4,\u2026          $    4\u2026      \n    Do\u2026                                       \n    Je\u2026                                       \n    H.         $    3,\u2026          $    3\u2026      \n    von                                       \n    Gi\u2026                                       \n    Gu\u2026        $    2,\u2026          $    3\u2026      \n    Ke\u2026                                       \n    Ti\u2026                                       \n    A.         $    2,\u2026          $    3\u2026      \n    We\u2026                                       \n                                              \nSelecting the performance metrics for the PRSU\nawards The number of PRSUs earned at the end\nof the three-year performance period is\ndetermined by a formula that uses a comparison\nof our actual ROE result to target-level ROE,\nas well as our ROE performance relative to our\npeer financial institutions. ROE is used as\nthe performance metric because: \u25b6 it directly\nreflects the return generated by the company\non our shareholders\u2019 investment; \u25b6 it\nencompasses profitability, efficiency, balance\nsheet management and financial leverage, and\nis among the most widely used indicators of\nfinancial performance in our industry; \u25b6\nachieving a high ROE requires an appropriate\nbalance between achieving the highest return\non invested capital and managing risk within\nthe company\u2019s established risk tolerance\nlevels; and \u25b6 using ROE as a performance\nmetric aligns the interests of the executives\nwith those of long-term shareholders, because\nsustaining a high ROE is a primary driver of\nstrong earnings growth and long-term\nvaluation. The Committee uses a performance\nmatrix, illustrated below, that reflects both\nabsolute and relative ROE scales to determine\nthe final PRSU award amounts earned during the\nperformance period. Target levels of both\nabsolute and relative ROE are established,\nwith maximum and minimum levels also\nidentified. Earn-out amounts are determined\nusing straight-line interpolation. The\nCommittee believes that the PRSU earn-out\nstructure provides an important balance\nbetween rewarding the achievement of absolute\nperformance goals and strong relative\nperformance.

In addition, by using\na sliding scale for each ROE performance\nmetric, the matrix takes into account the\namount of variance from the ROE target and\npeer group ROE results, rewarding performance\nwhile mitigating the incentive for excessive\nrisk taking that may result from an \u201call-or-\nnothing\u201d award. Setting the levels of absolute\nand relative ROE for the PRSU performance\nmatrix The target and maximum ROE levels\nselected by the Committee for the three-year\nperformance period are based on the ROE range\nincluded in the company\u2019s profitability goals\npublicly communicated prior to the grant date.\nThe Company\u2019s ROE result may be adjusted from\nreported results to normalize the effect of\nsignificant notable items, e.g. merger-related\ncharges in the event of an acquisition. Since\n2020, ROE results include adjustments related\nto the impact of the CECL accounting standard.\nThe adjustments eliminate the volatility of\nthe accounting standard related to changes in\nthe allowance for credit losses, while\nincluding net charge-offs related to actual\ncredit losses experienced. These CECL-related\nadjustments to the ROE calculation for the\nPRSU awards were adopted by the Committee in\nJanuary 2020, when we adopted the accounting\nstandard. The Committee also establishes a\nsliding scale of ROE achieved relative to the\nROE of our financial peer group, which\nconsists of the following institutions: Bank\nof America, Citizens, Fifth Third, J.P.\nMorgan, KeyCorp, PNC, Regions, Truist\nFinancial, and Wells Fargo. This group is used\nby the company for financial comparison\npurposes because these companies, along with\nU.S. Bancorp, are the largest financial\nservices companies based in the United States\nthat provide broadly comparable retail and\ncommercial banking services. The ROE\nperformance matrix provides that performance\nabove the median of peers will increase the\npayout otherwise earned based on our absolute\nROE result, while performance below the median\nof peers will reduce the award payout. The\ncompany\u2019s absolute and relative ROE results\nfor each of the three years within the\nperformance period are applied to the\nperformance matrix to produce a percentage of\ntarget PRSUs results for that year. At the end\nof the performance period, the percentage\nresults for the three years will be averaged\nto determine the percentage of target PRSUs\nearned and eligible to vest upon the third\nanniversary of the grant date.

of the NEO\u2019s role with\ncorresponding roles in peer institutions. The\nCommittee used the following group of\nfinancial services companies to perform market\nassessments when setting the compensation of\nour executive officers in 2022 (listed in\ndescending order of assets as of December 31,\n2022):\n                                              \n                        \u2026                     \n           \u2026            \u2026            \u2026        \n           \u2026            \u2026            \u2026        \n           \u2026            \u2026            \u2026        \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n           $            $            $        \n           $            $            $        \n           $            $            $        \n           $            $            $        \n           $            $            $        \n           $            $            $        \n           $            $            $        \n           $            $            $        \n           $            $            $        \n           $            $            $        \n           \u200b             \u200b             \u200b         \n                                              \n1.

Source: S&P Capital IQ based on company\nfilings and market data; for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 There were no changes to the\n2021 peer group; accordingly, the 2022 peer\ngroup consisted of the same peer companies.\nThe Committee selects compensation peer group\ncompanies that it believes represent our most\nmeaningful competitors in the marketplace for\nexecutive talent. The Committee also reviews\nand uses compensation data from a large group\nof diversified financial services companies as\nan additional point of comparison. As a result\nof this ongoing analysis and resulting\ncompensation adjustments, our executive\ncompensation positioning is generally within\nmarket range, recognizing that several\npositions are unique to our company and do not\nhave clear market comparisons. Stock ownership\nand retention requirements The Committee\nbelieves that ownership of our common stock by\nour executive officers directly aligns their\ninterests with those of our other shareholders\nand helps balance the incentives for risk\ntaking inherent in equity-based awards. We\nrequire our executives to hold significant\namounts of company stock. We also require that\nthey retain until retirement a substantial\nportion of their vested stock awards (net of\nshares withheld to satisfy tax obligations),\neven after minimum ownership levels have been\nmet. The current ownership and retention\nrequirements are as follows:\n                                              \n                  Retention                   \n                  requirement                 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                      A\u2026      \n                           Un\u2026        m\u2026      \n                 M\u2026        mi\u2026        l\u2026      \n      Ex\u2026        o\u2026        le\u2026        is      \n      Of\u2026        l\u2026        is         m\u2026      \n                           met        a\u2026      \n                                      u\u2026      \n                                      r\u2026      \n                 6x        75%        5\u2026      \n      CEO        b\u2026        of         of      \n                 s\u2026        net        n\u2026      \n                           sh\u2026        s\u2026      \n      Ot\u2026        3x        75%        2\u2026      \n      ex\u2026        b\u2026        of         of      \n      of\u2026        s\u2026        net        n\u2026      \n                           sh\u2026        s\u2026      \n                                              \nVested PRSUs, all RSUs, and stock received and\nheld after exercise of stock options are\nincluded in determining whether an executive\nofficer satisfies his or her ownership\nrequirements.

Change-in-control provisions for\nexecutive officers \u25b6 No cash benefit:The\nexecutive officers are not entitled to receive\nany cash payments upon a change-in-control of\nour company, with or without a subsequent\ntermination in employment, except as provided\nby broad-based severance plans generally\navailable to our employees. None of our NEOs\nhave employment or standalone change-in-\ncontrol agreements. \u25b6 No single-trigger equity\nacceleration:The equity award agreements for\nexecutive officers provide that a change-in-\ncontrol of our company would not trigger\naccelerated vesting of an executive officer\u2019s\noutstanding equity awards unless his or her\nemployment was involuntarily terminated within\n12 months after the change-in-control other\nthan for cause. Hedging and pledging policy\nThe company\u2019s Insider Trading Policy prohibits\nexecutive officers and directors of the\ncompany from hedging shares of the company\u2019s\ncommon stock, including, but not limited to,\nusing prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps,\ncollars and exchange funds. The policy also\nprohibits executive officers and directors\nfrom pledging shares of the company\u2019s common\nstock as collateral for a loan or holding the\ncompany\u2019s common stock in a margin account.\nHealth and other benefits Our NEOs are\neligible to receive health benefits under the\nsame plans and on the same terms available to\nour other employees, matching contributions to\ntheir U.S. Bank 401(k) Savings Plan accounts\non the same basis as our other employees, and\nretirement benefits that are earned over their\ncareer with the company. Our NEOs and certain\nother employees are eligible to participate in\nour Deferred Compensation Plan. We provide\nadditional information on these plans in the\n\u201cExecutive Compensation\u201d section below. In\naddition, the principal perquisites we may\nprovide to our executive officers include\nreasonable home security system services,\nparking and financial planning expense\nreimbursement, business club dues, and limited\npersonal use of corporate aircraft and\ncorporate housing for out-of-state commuting\npurposes. NEOs do not receive gross-up\npayments for tax liabilities resulting from\nperquisites, except in relation to certain\nrelocation expenses. Risk considerations\nOverview:Prudent risk taking is an integral\npart of any business strategy, and our\ncompensation program is not intended to\nencourage management decisions that completely\neliminate risk. Rather, the combination of\nvarious elements in our program is designed to\nencourage appropriate sensitivity to risk and\nmitigate the potential to reward risk taking\nthat may produce short-term results that\nappear in isolation to be favorable, but that\nmay undermine the successful execution of our\nlong-term business strategy and negatively\naffect shareholder value. Our compensation\npractices are also designed to reward\nperformance while maintaining our core\ncommitment to customer service and ethical\nprinciples. Together with the company\u2019s\nprocesses for strategic planning, its internal\ncontrol over financial reporting and other\nfinancial and compliance policies and\npractices, the design of our compensation\nprogram helps to discourage management actions\nthat demonstrate insensitivity to risk. Role\nof management:As a large financial services\ncompany, we are subject to ongoing regulatory\nreviews of incentive compensation policies and\npractices. We routinely undertake a thorough\nrisk analysis of every incentive compensation\nplan of the company, the individuals covered\nby each plan and the risks inherent in each\nplan\u2019s design and implementation. We also\nconduct validation and back-testing activities\nto ensure that our compensation plans are\ncorrectly risk rated, that they\n                                              \n    58      U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Compensation discussion and\nanalysis\n\nare designed to adequately mitigate inherent\nrisk, and that each plan is administered\neffectively. The Incentive Review Committee\nwas created to oversee that review and to\nprovide more comprehensive oversight of the\nrelationship between the various kinds of risk\nwe manage and our company\u2019s incentive\ncompensation plans and programs. The Incentive\nReview Committee meets throughout the year and\nreviews and approves all company incentive\nplans. The Incentive Review Committee reviews\nincentive plan elements such as risk controls,\nplan participants, performance measures,\nperformance and payout curves or formulas, how\ntarget level performance is determined\n(including whether any thresholds and caps\nexist), how frequently payouts occur, and the\nmix of fixed and variable compensation that\nthe plan delivers. The plans and programs are\nalso reviewed from the standpoint of\nreasonableness (for example, how target pay\nlevels compare to similar plans for similar\nemployee groups at other companies, and how\npayout amounts relate to the results that\ngenerate the payments), how well the plans and\nprograms are aligned with the company\u2019s goals\nand objectives and with its risk appetite, and\nfrom an overall standpoint, whether these\nplans and programs represent an appropriate\nmix of short-term and long-term compensation.\nAs part of this review by the Incentive Review\nCommittee, our management team, including\nsenior risk officers and individuals from the\ncompensation department, have identified the\nrisks inherent in these programs and have\nmodified plans and controls where appropriate\nto mitigate certain potential risks. For\nexample, most business line incentive\ncompensation plans with a credit component\ntrack early defaults, or defaults that occur\nwithin the first 12 months, and must include a\nprovision that allows the company to offset\nfuture payments by the amount of the\npreviously paid incentives related to the\nearly default. In addition, a \u201crisk scorecard\u201d\nassessment measuring adequacy of risk\nmanagement is undertaken for senior\nmanagement-level employees who have the\nindividual ability to pose material risk to\nthe company, including the executive officers;\nall employees who have credit responsibility\nand who participate in annual corporate cash\nincentive plans; and all employees who, as\npart of a group, can engage in risk-taking\nbehavior that could be material to the company\nand who participate in annual corporate cash\nincentive plans. This analysis serves as the\nbasis for annual cash incentive plan\nadjustments for these employees. Annually, the\nIncentive Review Committee also addresses risk\nevents that pose a material adverse impact to\nthe company or business line to determine\nwhether an event should trigger cancellation\nof equity awards. The Incentive Review\nCommittee has reviewed its process with the\nCommittee and discussed the areas where\ncompensation-related risks were being\naddressed by plan modifications, or were\nmitigated by internal controls or otherwise.\nRole of the Board:The Committee also conducts\nan annual review of the compensation packages\nand components for the executive officers. The\nCommittee assesses the incentives for risk\ntaking contained in the compensation program\nand balances them with the other goals of the\ncompensation program. In evaluating the\nincentives for risk taking in compensation\nplans and policies for executive officers, the\nCommittee considered the following risk-\nmitigating aspects of those plans and\npolicies:\n                                              \n      Overall executive compensation          \n      program risk mitigation factors         \n      \u25b6                                       \n      Long-term incentive focus:The           \n      majority of the total compensation      \n      received by executive officers is       \n      in the form of equity awards with       \n      multi-year vesting schedules,           \n      which helps to ensure that              \n      executives have significant value       \n      tied to long-term stock price           \n      performance and mitigates               \n      incentives to manage the company        \n      with an excessive focus on              \n      short-term gain.                        \n      \u200b

See Note 18 to our\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nassumptions used to calculate our stock\nawards. The 2022 values in this table reflect\nthe fair market value of each officer\u2019s RSUs\nplus the target payout for the PRSUs on the\ngrant date. The number of PRSUs subject to\neach of these awards will be determined after\na three-year performance period beginning on\nJanuary 1, 2022, and ending December 31, 2024.\nDepending on our company performance during\nthe performance period, 0% to 150% of the\ntarget number of PRSUs granted to the NEOs\nwill be earned. The fair market value of RSUs\nplus the maximum potential payout amounts for\nthe PRSUs on the grant date were as follows:\n(i) Mr. Cecere, $13,000,000; (ii) Mr. Dolan,\n$5,460,000; (iii) Mr. von Gillern, $4,225,000;\n(iv) Ms. Kedia, $4,225,000; and (v) Mr. Welsh,\n$4,225,000. 2. Non-equity incentive plan\ncompensation\nThe 2022 amounts in this column represent the\nAnnual Executive Incentive Plan, or AEIP,\nawards. Such amounts were determined in\nJanuary 2023 based on 2022 performance and\npaid out in March 2023.

Change in pension\nvalue and non-qualified deferred compensation\nearnings\nThe amounts in this column represent the\nincrease in the actuarial net present value of\nall future retirement benefits under the U.S.\nBank Pension Plan and the U.S. Bank Non-\nQualified Retirement Plan. A number of factors\ncan cause the amounts reflected in this column\nto vary significantly, including volatility in\nthe discount rate applied to determine the\nvalue of future payment streams and changes to\nmortality assumptions. The change in present\nvalue amounts reported for 2022 is smaller\nthan those reported for 2021 for each NEO.\nThese smaller increases in value are due to\nthe rise in discount rates in 2022; year-end\n2022 rates were roughly 255 basis points\nhigher than for year-end 2021, compared with a\nroughly 35 basis point increase from the prior\nyear.

No amount\nis included in this column for Messrs. Cecere,\nDolan and von Gillern for 2022 because the\nactuarial net present value of their future\nretirement benefits decreased by the following\namounts: (i) Mr. Cecere, $2,551,930; (ii) Mr.\nDolan, $456,029; and (iii) Mr. von Gillern,\n$240,659. The values for Ms. Kedia and Mr.\nWelsh are positive due to their having fewer\nyears of service and all of their benefits\ndelivered from the cash balance plan. The\nhigher discount rate on past-service benefits\nis surpassed by the 2022 benefit earned in the\ncash balance plan. The net present values of\nthe pension benefits as of December 31, 2022,\nused to calculate the net change in pension\nbenefits were determined using the same\nassumptions used to determine our pension\nobligations and expense for financial\nstatement purposes. See Note 17 to our\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for these\nspecific assumptions. Additional information\nabout our Pension Plan and Non-Qualified\nRetirement Plan is included below under the\nheading \u201cPension Benefits.\u201d We have not\nprovided above-market or preferential earnings\non any nonqualified deferred compensation and,\naccordingly, no such amounts are reflected in\nthis column. 4.

The amount for Ms. Kedia represents\nexpenses for corporate housing in Minnesota,\nair travel expenses related to use of aircraft\nfractionally-owned by the company or\ncommercial flights, and related parking and\nground transportation when commuting between\nher out-of-state residence and our corporate\nheadquarters in Minnesota. b. The amount for\nMr. Cecere represents the incremental cost for\npersonal use of company-owned aircraft for one\nround-trip flight and meal costs incurred by\nhis spouse at employee recognition events she\nattended as his guest. The amount for Mr.\nWelsh represents the value of nominal gifts\nreceived in connection with business events.\nThe aggregate incremental cost for corporate-\nowned aircraft is determined by multiplying\nthe total number of personal flight hours by\nthe direct variable operating costs of the\naircraft per hour including costs related to\nfuel, landing and parking fees, and crew\nexpenses. For fractionally-owned aircraft, the\nincremental cost is determined by multiplying\nthe total number of personal flight hours by\nthe contracted hourly and fuel charges. As the\naircraft are used primarily for business\ntravel, we do not include fixed costs that do\nnot change based on usage, such as crew\nsalaries, aircraft acquisition costs and\nmonthly management fees for fractionally-owned\naircraft. In addition, a NEO\u2019s spouse might\naccompany him or her on a business-related\nflight on a company-owned aircraft if a seat\non that aircraft would otherwise be empty.\nThere is no incremental cost to our company\nfor such flights. Our NEOs are occasionally\npermitted to use sporting and cultural events\ntickets. As such tickets were previously\nacquired by our company for business\nentertainment, there is no incremental cost to\nour company for the use of such tickets.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy             63    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\n\nGrants of plan-based awards The following\ntable summarizes the equity and non-equity\nplan-based awards granted to the NEOs in\nfiscal year 2022.

The measurement date and material actuarial\nassumptions applied in quantifying the present\nvalue of the current accrued benefits are\ndiscussed in Note 17 to our consolidated\nfinancial statements included in our 2022\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. These assumptions\ninclude the use of a 5.49% discount rate for\nthe supplemental and excess plans and a 5.59%\ndiscount rate for the qualified pension plan.\nThe mortality assumptions used are based on\nthe white-collar PRI-2012 mortality table\nprojected generationally using the MP-2021\nimprovement scale. The average pay used for\nthe benefit calculations was historical pay\nthrough the measurement date (December 31,\n2022). The amounts in this column were\ncalculated based on the earliest age at which\nthe applicable NEO is entitled to receive\nunreduced retirement benefits and ignore any\nvesting requirements. The earliest age of\nunreduced retirement benefits is 65 for all\nour NEOs, and all are currently vested in 100%\nof their pension benefits. 2. In the event of\nthe death of one of the NEOs in this table, a\npre-established percentage of the NEO\u2019s\npension benefits will be paid to the NEO\u2019s\nbeneficiary. The actual percentage paid to the\nbeneficiary is dependent on the form of\npayment of benefits elected by the NEO. The\ndefault percentage is 50% to the NEO\u2019s spouse.\nAn additional lump sum death benefit may be\npayable based on certain actuarial\ncalculations. The benefit amounts shown in\nthis column assume that each NEO will reach\nhis or her retirement age. Due to the increase\nin discount rates, the present value of death\nbenefits commencing immediately would exceed\nthe total present value of accumulated\nbenefits shown in this column by the following\namounts: (i) Mr. Cecere, $1,998,043; (ii) Mr.\nDolan, 0; (iii) Mr. von Gillern, $152,400;\n(iv) Ms. Kedia, $162,262; and (v) Mr. Welsh,\n$62,743. 3. Mr. Cecere is 100% vested and\neligible to begin receiving his U.S. Bank\nPension Plan benefit and the pre-2005 portion\nof his excess and supplemental benefits under\nthe U.S. Bank Non-Qualified Retirement Plan\nupon retirement at any age. The remainder of\nhis excess and supplemental benefits are\npayable upon the later of age 62 or\nretirement. If any of the vested benefits are\npaid before Mr. Cecere reaches age 65, the\nbenefits are reduced by certain early\nretirement benefit formulas specified in the\napplicable plan for each year prior to Mr.\nCecere\u2019s reaching age 65. These early\nretirement benefit formulas reduce the annual\npension benefit amount payable to Mr. Cecere\ndue to the longer benefit payment period\nrelated to the earlier commencement of\nbenefits. Per the standard provisions of the\nsupplemental plan, upon his attainment of age\n60, Mr. Cecere became eligible for five\naccelerated years of service credit for\nservice to age 65. Mr. Cecere is currently\neligible for three accelerated years of\nservice credit, worth approximately $1.4\nmillion; this value will gradually be\nreflected in the table above and will have no\nextra value if he works to age 65. There is no\neffect on the applicable early reductions or\nbenefit timing noted above. Understanding our\nPension Benefits Table This section provides\ninformation regarding the company\u2019s retirement\nprograms in which our NEOs participate, which\ninclude the U.S. Bank Pension Plan and the\nU.S. Bank Non-Qualified Retirement Plan. Our\ncompany sponsors the U.S. Bank Pension Plan\n(the Pension Plan) which was created through\nthe merger of the former U.S. Bancorp\u2019s career\naverage pay defined benefit plan, the U.S.\nBancorp Cash Balance Pension Plan (which we\nrefer to as the Old Cash Balance Plan), and\nthe former Firstar Corporation\u2019s non-\ncontributory defined benefit plan, which was\nprimarily a final average pay plan (the\nFirstar Plan). The Firstar Plan was frozen to\nnew-hire employees on July 3, 2008, and to\nrehire employees on November 15, 2009.\nParticipation in the Pension Plan requires one\nyear of service with U.S. Bancorp or its\naffiliates. Employees who were hired or\nrehired prior to July 3, 2008, or November 15,\n2009, respectively, could elect to (i)\ncontinue to accrue benefits under the final\naverage pay formula of the Pension Plan, or\n(ii) accrue benefits under the U.S. Bank 2010\n                                              \n    68      U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation Cash\nBalance Plan (the 2010 Cash Balance Plan),\nwhich represents the cash balance portion of\nthe Pension Plan. In the event of no election,\nparticipants defaulted into the 2010 Cash\nBalance Plan. Participants that elected to\nreceive pension benefits or defaulted into the\nCash Balance Plan had their existing benefits\nin the pension plan frozen and earn future\nbenefits under the cash balance formula, under\nwhich participants receive (i) annual pay\ncredits based on eligible pay multiplied by a\npercentage determined by their age and years\nof service, and (ii) an annual interest\ncredit. For participants who elected to\ncontinue to accrue benefits under the final\naverage pay formula, benefits are calculated\nusing a final average pay formula, based upon\nthe participant\u2019s years of service and average\nsalary of the five-consecutive-year period in\nwhich compensation was the highest during the\nten years prior to retirement. Normal\nretirement age is 65. Vesting of benefits\nrequires five years of service for benefits\nunder the final average pay formula and three\nyears of service for benefits under the 2010\nCash Balance Plan. Mr. Dolan is the only NEO\n(of those eligible at the time) who elected to\nremain covered by the final average pay\nformula; all other NEOs are covered by the\n2010 Cash Balance Plan. Although no new\nbenefits accrued under the Old Cash Balance\nPlan and Firstar Plan for service after 2001,\nbenefits previously earned under those plans\nhave been preserved and will be part of a\nretiree\u2019s total retirement benefit. In order\nto preserve the relative value of benefits\nthat use the final average pay formula,\nsubsequent changes in compensation (but not in\nservice) may increase the amount of those\nbenefits. Messrs. Cecere, Dolan and von\nGillern have earned benefits under the Old\nCash Balance Plan that will be included in\ntheir ultimate retirement benefits. The U.S.\nBank Non-Qualified Retirement Plan As federal\nlaws limit the amount of compensation we may\nconsider when determining benefits payable\nunder qualified defined benefit pension plans,\nwe also maintain a non-contributory, non-\nqualified retirement plan, the U.S. Bank Non-\nQualified Retirement Plan, which we refer to\nas the Non-Qualified Plan. The Non-Qualified\nPlan pays the excess pension benefits that\nwould have been payable under our current and\nprior qualified defined benefit pension plans\nif the federal limits were not in effect. As\npart of her compensation package, Ms. Kedia\nreceives an additional 23 years of service\nwhen calculating her pay credits in the Non-\nQualified Plan. The additional years of\nservice represent her service with her prior\nemployer. Messrs. Cecere, Dolan and von\nGillern are eligible for a supplemental\nbenefit, which is also paid under the Non-\nQualified Plan, that augments benefits earned\nunder the Pension Plan and the non-qualified\nexcess benefits discussed above. The\nsupplemental benefit ensures that eligible\nNEOs receive a total retirement benefit equal\nto a fixed percentage of the NEO\u2019s final\naverage cash compensation. For purposes of\nthis supplemental benefit, final average cash\ncompensation includes annual base salary,\nannual cash bonuses and other cash\ncompensation awards as determined by the\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee.\nEligibility for these supplemental benefits\nhas been determined by this committee based on\nindividual performance and level of\nresponsibility. Vesting of the supplemental\nbenefit is generally subject to certain\nconditions, including that an NEO provide a\ncertain number of years of service determined\nby the Compensation and Human Resources\nCommittee. Mr. Cecere is eligible for an\namount of total retirement benefits at age 65\nequal to 55% of the average cash compensation\nduring his final three years of service,\nreduced by his estimated retirement benefits\nfrom Social Security. Mr. Cecere is fully\nvested in his supplemental benefit. In the\ncase of Messrs. Dolan and von Gillern, their\nsupplemental benefits were frozen in 2001.\nAccordingly, Mr. Dolan has a frozen monthly\nannuity of $522, in which he is fully vested,\npayable as early as his termination date, and\nMr. von Gillern also has a frozen monthly\nannuity benefit of $138, in which he is fully\nvested, payable as early as his termination\ndate. In accordance with his election, Mr.\nCecere\u2019s supplemental benefit will be paid in\nthe form of a lump sum. For the supplemental\nbenefits payable to Messrs. Dolan and von\nGillern, the standard form is either a lump\nsum or a joint and survivor annuity, depending\non the present value of the lump sum at\nretirement. As the present value of the\nsupplemental benefit for Messrs. Dolan and von\nGillern is currently less than $400,000, in\naccordance with plan rules, their supplemental\nbenefit will default to payment in a lump sum.\nMessrs. Dolan and von Gillern each have the\noption to make an election to receive their\nsupplemental benefit as an annuity if the\nelection is made 12 months prior to their\nrespective termination dates, they are over\nage 55, and the present value of the\nsupplemental benefit exceeds $50,000. The\namount of the lump sum distribution equals the\nactuarial equivalent of the annuity form of\npayment and is calculated using substantially\nsimilar actuarial assumptions as for our\npension plan obligations discussed in Note 17\nto our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in our 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The means of calculating the various\nannuity benefits are described in the pension\nplan.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy             69    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\n\nNonqualified deferred compensation Under the\nU.S. Bank Executive Employees Deferred\nCompensation Plan (2005 Statement) (the\nExecutive Deferred Compensation Plan), members\nof our senior management, including all of our\nNEOs, may choose to defer all or a part of\ntheir annual base salary and annual cash\nincentive payments.

Participants\nare allowed to change their investment\nelections at any time, but the changes are\nonly effective at the beginning of the\nfollowing calendar quarter. The measurement\nfunds are merely measuring tools to determine\nthe amount by which account balances will be\ndebited or credited to reflect deemed\ninvestment returns on deferred compensation.\nAlthough the plan administrator has\nestablished procedures permitting a\nparticipant to reallocate deferred amounts\namong these investment alternatives after the\ninitial election to defer, the election to\ndefer is irrevocable, and the deferred\ncompensation will not be paid to the\nparticipant until his or her retirement or\nearlier termination of employment. At that\ntime, the participant will receive, depending\nupon the payment choice and investment\nalternatives selected by the participant,\npayment of the amounts credited to the\nparticipant\u2019s account under the plan in a\nlump-sum payment or in annual installments\nover 5, 10, 15 or 20 years. Payments are made\nratably in cash from each of the investment\nalternatives in which the participant has a\nbalance, except the U.S. Bancorp stock fund,\nwhich is generally paid in shares. If a\nparticipant dies before the entire deferred\namount has been distributed, the undistributed\nportion will be paid to the participant\u2019s\nbeneficiary in a single lump sum.

Potential payments upon termination\nor change-in-control General Any NEO whose\nemployment is voluntarily or involuntarily\nterminated is entitled to the payments or\nother benefits that have accrued and are\nvested under the benefit plans discussed above\nin this proxy statement. Except as is\nspecifically described below with respect to\ndisability, death, termination of employment\nfollowing a change-in-control (as defined in\nthe equity award agreements) or early\nretirement, no NEO is entitled to any other\nbenefits upon any employment termination or\nchange-in-control scenario. Payments made upon\ndisability Cash payments:Under the terms of\nthe Non-Qualified Plan, Mr. Cecere is eligible\nfor an annual disability benefit that is equal\nto 60% of his current annual cash\ncompensation. The definition of disability is\nsimilar to that used for the broad-based\ndisability program described below. The\ndefinition of annual cash compensation is the\nsame definition as is used to calculate\nsupplemental pension benefits under this plan,\nwithout using a five-year average. His\nagreement under the non-qualified retirement\nplan provides that Mr. Cecere is eligible to\nreceive disability payments through the\nearlier of the cessation of his disability or\nreaching his normal retirement age. Messrs.\nDolan, von Gillern, and Welsh and Ms. Kedia\nare eligible for an annual disability benefit\nof $150,000 (i.e., 50% of annual cash\ncompensation, capped at $300,000 of\ncompensation) under the terms of the U.S. Bank\nLong-Term Disability Insurance Plan insured by\nHartford Life and Accident Insurance Company,\nour broad-based disability program. Optional\nadditional disability insurance is available\nfor purchase by those NEOs. The definition of\ndisability is generally that a participant is\nunable to perform material duties of his or\nher own occupation for 24 months following the\nsix-month elimination period, or any\noccupation after 24 months, and suffers a loss\nof at least 20% in pre-disability earnings.\nThe definition of annual cash compensation is\nactual cash compensation for the one-year\nperiod ending September 30. The disability\nbenefit for any NEO would be reduced by any\nbenefits payable under the Pension Plan,\nSocial Security or worker\u2019s compensation. The\nduration of disability payments under this\nbroad-based program is dependent upon the age\nof the participant when the\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy             71    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\ndisability occurs. Because each of Messrs.\nDolan, von Gillern, and Welsh and Ms. Kedia is\nunder age 63, payments would continue through\nthe earlier of the cessation of their\ndisability or reaching their normal retirement\nage, assuming all other plan conditions are\nmet. Effect on equity awards:If any NEO\u2019s\nemployment is terminated due to disability,\nour equity award agreements provide that the\nvesting and other terms of those awards will\ncontinue as if the termination of employment\ndid not occur. No financial information for\nthe event of disability is set forth below in\nthe Potential Payments Upon Disability, Death,\nor Termination After a Change-in-Control table\nbelow for the equity awards held by our NEOs,\nas there is no immediate financial impact upon\nthe occurrence of this event. Payments made\nupon death Cash payments:NEOs are eligible to\nreceive life insurance benefits under the same\nplans available to our other employees. Their\nbenefit is equal to annual cash compensation,\ncapped at $300,000. In addition, optional term\nlife insurance is available for purchase. As\nthis benefit is generally available to all\nsalaried employees and does not discriminate\nin scope, terms, or operation in favor of the\nNEOs, the value has not been quantified in the\nPotential Payments Upon Disability, Death, or\nTermination After a Change-in-Control table.\nEffect on equity awards:Our equity award\nagreements provide for the acceleration of any\nunvested award upon death. For all RSUs and\nPRSUs, outstanding units will vest at target\nupon death. All of our NEO\u2019s stock options\nhave vested, and the stock option award\nagreements provide that the administrator of\nthe NEO\u2019s estate has a three-year period after\ndeath during which to exercise the options.\nPayments upon termination after a change-in-\ncontrol Cash payments:None of our NEOs is\nentitled to any cash payments in connection\nwith a change-in-control of U.S. Bancorp.\nEffect on equity awards:Our equity award\nagreements provide for the acceleration of\nvesting of any unvested award if an NEO\u2019s\nemployment is involuntarily terminated within\n12 months after a change-in-control of U.S.\nBancorp other than for cause (as defined in\nthe equity award agreements). All outstanding\nRSUs and PRSUs will vest at target upon a\nqualifying termination (as defined in the\nequity award agreements). All of our NEO\u2019s\nstock options have vested. Stock options may\nbe exercised at any time during the 12 months\nfollowing the NEO\u2019s termination. Payments upon\nearly retirement The benefit amounts for each\nNEO in the Pension Benefits Table above assume\nthat each NEO will reach his or her retirement\nage. Due to the increase in cash balance\ninterest crediting rates relative to increases\nin discount rates, the present value of early\nretirement benefits commencing immediately\nwould exceed the values in the Pension\nBenefits Table by the following amounts: (i)\nMr. Cecere, $1,363,447; (ii) Mr. Dolan, $0;\n(iii) Mr. von Gillern, $624; (iv) Ms. Kedia,\n$18,144; and (v) Mr. Welsh, $11,675. The\nincremental value for Mr. Cecere includes\nthree accelerated years of service for this\nSERP benefit upon reaching age 60, and his\nbenefits are all now payable upon separation\nof service. As Messrs. Dolan, von Gillern and\nWelsh and Ms. Kedia have not yet attained age\n62, only their qualified retirement benefits\nand grandfathered 409A benefits can be\naccelerated. Quantification of estimated\npayments and benefits The following table\nshows potential annual cash payments to the\nNEOs upon disability and the potential\nbenefits the NEOs could accrue through\naccelerated equity vesting upon death or\ninvoluntary termination of employment (other\nthan for cause) following a change-in-control\nof U.S. Bancorp. No information regarding\npension amounts payable to the NEOs is shown\nin the following table; applicable pension\namounts payable to NEOs are discussed above\nunder the heading \u201cPension Benefits.\u201d The\namounts shown assume that termination was\neffective as of December 31, 2022, and are\nestimates of the amounts that would be paid to\nthe NEOs upon termination, in addition to the\nbase salary and cash incentive payments earned\nby them during 2022. The actual amounts to be\npaid can only be determined at the time of an\nNEO\u2019s termination.\n                                              \n    72      U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Executive compensation\n\nPotential payments upon disability, death, or\ntermination after a change-in-control\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n1.

The\nratio stated above is a reasonable estimate\ncalculated in a manner consistent with Item\n402(u) of Regulation S-K. In making this pay\nratio disclosure, other companies may use\nassumptions, estimates, and methodologies\ndifferent than ours; as a result, the\nforegoing information may not be directly\ncomparable to the information provided by\nother companies in our peer group or\notherwise. Median employee identification and\ncompensation calculation We identified our\nmedian employee based on compensation paid\nduring 2020 to all of our U.S.-based\nemployees, other than our CEO, who were\nemployed by us on December 31, 2020. We\nconsidered any person to whom we delivered a\nForm W-2 Wage and Tax Statement (Form W-2) for\nservices performed in 2020 to be a U.S.-based\nemployee, which includes full-time, part-time,\nand temporary workers. For purposes of\ndetermining the compensation paid to the\nemployees under consideration, we used\nearnings subject to Medicare tax as reported\nin Box 5, \u201cMedicare wages and tips,\u201d on each\nemployee\u2019s 2020 Form W-2. We did not annualize\nthe compensation of anyone who was employed by\nus for only part of the year. As allowed by\nItem 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are using\nthe same median employee for our 2023 pay\nratio disclosure as we used for our 2022 pay\nratio disclosure because there has been no\nchange in our employee population or employee\ncompensation arrangements that we believe\nwould significantly impact the pay ratio\ndisclosure. In accordance with the \u201c de\nminimis\u201d exemption provided in Item 402(u) of\nRegulation S-K, we excluded from consideration\nall of our non-U.S. employees. As of December\n30, 2022, the last business day of the year,\nwe had 3,079 non-U.S. employees, representing\napproximately 3.9% of our total U.S. and\nnon-U.S. workforce of 78,524 active employees\non that date. The excluded employees work in\nthe following jurisdictions: Ireland (1,111),\nPoland (953), United Kingdom (505), Canada\n(197), Spain (118), Lithuania (71), Germany\n(51), Luxembourg (36), Norway (23), Sweden\n(13), and Cayman Islands (1).

The metrics used\nwithin our incentive plans are selected to\nsupport these objectives. The most important\nfinancial performance measures used by the\ncompany to link executive compensation\nactually paid to the company\u2019s NEOs for the\nmost recently completed fiscal year to the\ncompany\u2019s performance are as follows: \u25b6 Total\nShareholder Return (TSR) \u25b6 Adjusted Return on\nEquity (ROE) \u25b6 Adjusted EPS \u25b6 Corporate Pretax\nIncome \u25b6 Business Line Pretax Income Analysis\nof the Information Presented in the Pay versus\nPerformance Table While the company utilizes\nseveral performance measures to align\nexecutive compensation with company\nperformance, not all of those company measures\nare presented in the Pay versus Performance\ntable set forth above. Moreover, the company\ngenerally seeks to incentivize positive long-\nterm performance and, therefore, does not\nspecifically align the company\u2019s performance\nmeasures with compensation that is actually\npaid (as computed in accordance with Item\n402(v) of Regulation S-K) for a particular\nyear. In accordance with Item 402(v), the\ncompany is providing the following\ndescriptions of the relationships between\ninformation presented in the Pay versus\nPerformance table. TSR:TSR has the most direct\nand significant impact on CEO and NEO\ncompensation actually paid.

This plan provides\nthat no non-employee director may receive an\nequity award or awards with an aggregate grant\ndate fair value in excess of $600,000 in any\ncalendar year. The restricted stock units were\nfully vested at the time of grant, but the\nunderlying shares will not be delivered until\nthe director ceases to serve on the Board.\nEach non-employee director may elect to have\nall of his or her shares delivered promptly\nfollowing cessation of service or to have the\nshares delivered in ten annual installments.\nEach non-employee director is entitled to\nreceive additional fully vested restricted\nstock units having a fair market value equal\nto the amount of dividends he or she would\nhave received had restricted stock been\nawarded instead of restricted stock units.\nDirector stock ownership requirements The\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee has\nestablished stock ownership requirements for\neach non-employee director equal to five times\nthe value of the annual cash retainer. New\ndirectors must satisfy this minimum ownership\nlevel within five years of joining the Board.\nAs of December 31, 2022, all of the directors\nserving at that time were in compliance with\nour stock ownership guidelines or were on\ntrack to be in compliance by the end of his or\nher five-year compliance period.

Administration\nof engagement of independent auditor The Audit\nCommittee is responsible for appointing,\ncompensating, retaining and overseeing the\nwork of our independent auditor, including\napproving the services provided by the\nindependent auditor and the associated fees.\nThe Audit Committee has established a policy\nfor pre-approving the services provided by our\nindependent auditor in accordance with the\nauditor independence rules of the SEC and the\nPCAOB. This policy requires the review and\npre-approval by the Audit Committee of all\naudit and permissible non-audit services\nprovided by our independent auditor and an\nannual review of the financial plan for audit\nfees. To ensure that auditor independence is\nmaintained, the Audit Committee annually pre-\napproves the audit services to be provided by\nour independent auditor and the related\nestimated fees for such services, as well as\nthe nature and extent of specific types of\naudit-related, tax and other non-audit\nservices to be provided by the independent\nauditor during the year. As the need arises,\nother specific permitted services are pre-\napproved on a case-by-case basis during the\nyear. A request for pre-approval of services\non a case-by-case basis must be submitted by\nour Controller or Chief Risk Officer. These\nrequests are required to include information\non the nature of the particular service to be\nprovided, estimated related fees and\nmanagement\u2019s assessment of the impact of the\nservice on the auditor\u2019s independence. The\nAudit Committee has delegated to its chair\npre-approval authority between meetings of the\nAudit Committee. Any pre-approvals made by the\nchair must be reported to the Audit Committee.\nThe Audit Committee will not delegate to\nmanagement the pre-approval of services to be\nperformed by our independent auditor. All of\nthe services provided by our independent\nauditor in 2022 and 2021, including services\nrelated to the Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees\nand All Other Fees described above, were\napproved by the Audit Committee under its pre-\napproval policies after consideration of any\nimpact of these services on the auditor\u2019s\nindependence.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy             83    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Proposal 4 \u2014 Ratification of\nselection of independent auditor\n\nProposal 4 \u2014 Ratification of selection of\nindependent auditor The Audit Committee has\nselected EY as our independent auditor for the\n2023 fiscal year. EY began serving as our\nindependent auditor for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2003. Our Audit Committee has\ncarefully considered the selection of EY as\nour independent auditor, and has also\nconsidered whether there should be regular\nrotation of the independent external audit\nfirm. The Audit Committee annually reviews\nEY\u2019s independence and performance in\nconnection with the committee\u2019s determination\nof whether to retain EY or engage another firm\nas our independent auditor. In determining\nwhether to reappoint EY as U.S. Bancorp\u2019s\nindependent auditor, the Audit Committee took\ninto consideration a number of factors,\nincluding: \u25b6 the qualifications of EY, the\nlead audit partner, and other key personnel; \u25b6\nthe length of time the firm has been engaged;\n\u25b6 the quality of the historical and recent\nperformance on the U.S. Bancorp audit; \u25b6 EY\u2019s\ncapability and expertise in handling the\nbreadth and complexity of our operations; \u25b6\nexternal data on audit quality and\nperformance, including the results of PCAOB\ninspection reports on EY and EY\u2019s response to\nthe matters raised in those reports, as well\nas actions to continue to enhance the quality\nof its audit practices; \u25b6 the appropriateness\nof EY\u2019s fees on an absolute basis and as\ncompared to peer firms; and \u25b6 the advisability\nand potential impact of selecting a different\nindependent audit firm. In accordance with SEC\nrules and company policies, lead and\nconcurring audit partners are subject to a\nmaximum of five years of service in that\ncapacity. The process for selecting the audit\nfirm\u2019s lead engagement partner involves\nmeetings with the candidates for the role by\nmanagement; review and discussion with the\nchair of the Audit Committee, who meets with\nselected candidates; and further discussion\nwith the full committee. The members of the\nAudit Committee believe the continued\nretention of EY to serve as our independent\nauditor is in the best interests of our\ncompany and its shareholders. While we are not\nrequired to do so, we are submitting the\nselection of EY to serve as our independent\nauditor for the 2023 fiscal year for\nratification in order to ascertain the views\nof our shareholders on this appointment. If\nthe selection is not ratified, the Audit\nCommittee will reconsider its selection.\nRepresentatives of EY are expected to attend\nthe annual meeting, will be available to\nanswer shareholder questions, and will have\nthe opportunity to make a statement if they\ndesire to do so.\n                                              \n        \u200b                             FOR      \n        The Board of Directors                \n        recommends that you vote              \n        \u201cFOR\u201d ratification of the             \n        selection of Ernst &                  \n        Young LLP as the                      \n        independent auditor of                \n        U.S. Bancorp for the 2023             \n        fiscal year.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n    84      U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy           \n            Statement                         \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Security ownership of\ncertain beneficial owners and management\n\nSecurity ownership of certain beneficial\nowners and management The following tables\nshow how many shares of our common stock were\nbeneficially owned as of February 3, 2023, by\neach current director and director nominee,\neach of the NEOs, all of our directors and\nexecutive officers as a group, and each person\nwho is known by us to beneficially own more\nthan 5% of our voting securities.

In order to access this         \n      material and vote, you will need        \n      the 16-digit control number             \n      provided in the e-mail or on the        \n      notice.

If you      \n      vote by mail, please complete,          \n      sign and date the proxy card or         \n      voting instruction form and mail        \n      it in the accompanying                  \n      pre-addressed envelope.                 \n      \u200b                                        \n                                              \nHow do I vote if my shares are held in the\nU.S. Bank 401(k) Savings Plan? If you hold any\nshares in the U.S. Bank 401(k) Savings Plan,\nyou are receiving, or being provided access\nto, the same proxy materials as any other\nshareholder. However, your proxy vote will\nserve as voting instructions to the plan\ntrustee. Your voting instructions must be\nreceived at least five days prior to the\nannual meeting in order to count. In\naccordance with the terms of the plan, the\ntrustee will vote all of the shares held in\nthe plan in the same proportion as the actual\nproxy votes submitted by plan participants at\nleast five days prior to the annual meeting.\nWhy did I receive a notice regarding the\nInternet availability of proxy materials\ninstead of a printed copy of the proxy\nmaterials? In accordance with rules adopted by\nthe SEC, we are furnishing our proxy materials\nto our shareholders primarily over the\nInternet instead of mailing printed copies of\nthose materials to each shareholder. By doing\nso, we reduce costs and lessen the\nenvironmental impact of our proxy\nsolicitation. On or about March 7, 2023, we\nmailed a notice of Internet availability of\nthe proxy materials to most of our\nshareholders. The notice contains instructions\nabout how to access our proxy materials and\nvote online. This notice is not a proxy card\nand cannot be used to vote your shares. If you\nreceived a notice but would like to receive a\npaper copy of our proxy materials, please\nfollow the instructions on the notice. Our\nother shareholders, including shareholders who\nhave previously requested to receive paper\ncopies of the proxy materials and persons\nholding shares through our benefit plans,\nreceived paper copies of the proxy materials\ninstead of a notice. If you received paper\ncopies of the notice or proxy materials, we\nencourage you to sign up to receive all of\nyour future proxy materials electronically, as\ndescribed under \u201cHow can I receive my proxy\nmaterials by e-mail in the future?\u201d below.\n                                              \n    U.S. Bancorp 2023 Proxy             87    \n    Statement                                 \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Questions and answers about\nthe annual meeting and voting Who is entitled\nto vote at the meeting? The Board has set\nFebruary 21, 2023, as the record date for the\nannual meeting. If you were a shareholder at\nthe close of business on February 21, 2023,\nyou are entitled to vote at the meeting. As of\nthe record date, 1,531,789,505 shares of our\ncommon stock were issued and outstanding and,\ntherefore, eligible to vote at the meeting.\nWhat are my voting rights? Holders of our\ncommon stock are entitled to one vote per\nshare. Therefore, a total of 1,531,789,505\nvotes are entitled to be cast at the meeting.\nThere is no cumulative voting. How many shares\nmust be present to hold the meeting? In\naccordance with our bylaws, shares equal to at\nleast one-third of the voting power of our\noutstanding shares of common stock as of the\nrecord date must be present at the meeting in\norder to hold the meeting and conduct\nbusiness. This is called a quorum. Your shares\nare counted as present at the meeting if: \u25b6\nyou have properly submitted a proxy vote by\nInternet, telephone or mail, even if you\nabstain from voting on one or more matters; or\n\u25b6 you hold your shares in street name (as\ndiscussed below) and you provide voting\ninstructions to your broker, bank, trust\ncompany or other nominee or you do not provide\nvoting instructions but your broker, bank,\ntrust company or other nominee uses its\ndiscretionary authority to vote your shares on\nthe ratification of the selection of our\nindependent auditor. What is the difference\nbetween a shareholder of record and a \u201cstreet\nname\u201d holder? If your shares are registered\ndirectly in your name with our transfer agent,\nComputershare Investor Services, you are\nconsidered the shareholder of record with\nrespect to those shares. If your shares are\nheld in a stock brokerage account or by a\nbank, trust company or other nominee, then the\nbroker, bank, trust company or other nominee\nis considered to be the shareholder of record\nwith respect to those shares. However, you\nstill are considered the beneficial owner of\nthose shares and your shares are said to be\nheld in \u201cstreet name.\u201d Street name holders\ngenerally cannot vote their shares directly\nand must instead instruct the broker, bank,\ntrust company or other nominee how to vote\ntheir shares using the voting instruction form\nprovided by it. How do I attend the virtual\nmeeting? We are holding the 2023 Annual\nMeeting of Shareholders in a virtual-only\nformat. You will not be able to attend the\nannual meeting at a physical location.

In order to allow      \n      all shareholders the ability to         \n      ask questions, we may limit each        \n      shareholder to two questions,           \n      whether submitted prior to or           \n      during the meeting.                     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      Shareholders must also enter the        \n      meeting using their 16-digit            \n      control number in order to vote.        \n      Even if you currently plan to           \n      attend the virtual meeting, we          \n      recommend that you submit your          \n      proxy as described above so that        \n      your vote will be counted if you        \n      later decide not to attend the          \n      meeting. If you are a participant       \n      in the U.S. Bank 401(k) Savings         \n      Plan or hold your shares in street      \n      name, you may submit your vote as       \n      described above, but you may not        \n      vote your 401(k) Savings Plan           \n      shares or shares held in street         \n      name during the meeting.                \n                                              \nWhat if I am a shareholder of record and do\nnot specify how I want my shares voted? If you\nsubmit your proxy by Internet or submit a\nsigned proxy card and do not specify how you\nwant to vote your shares, we will vote your\nshares in accordance with the recommendations\nof the Board. Our telephone voting procedures\ndo not permit you to submit your proxy vote by\ntelephone without specifying how you want your\nshares voted. What if I hold my shares in\nstreet name and do not provide voting\ninstructions? If you hold your shares in\nstreet name and do not provide voting\ninstructions, your broker, bank, trust company\nor other nominee has discretionary authority\nto vote your shares on the ratification of the\nselection of EY as our independent auditor.\nHowever, in the absence of your specific\ninstructions as to how to vote, your broker,\nbank, trust company or other nominee does not\nhave discretionary authority to vote on any\nother proposal. Such a situation results in a\n\u201cbroker non-vote,\u201d which does not have an\neffect on the outcome of the proposal. It is\nimportant, therefore, that you provide\ninstructions to your broker, bank, trust\ncompany or other nominee so that your vote\nwith respect to the other proposals is\ncounted. What is the voting standard and what\nis the effect of abstentions? You may vote\n\u201cFOR,\u201d \u201cAGAINST\u201d or \u201cABSTAIN\u201d with respect to\neach nominee for the Board of Directors\n(Proposal 1), the advisory vote on executive\ncompensation (Proposal 2), and the\nratification of the selection of independent\nauditor (Proposal 4).

We have procedures to ensure that all\nproxies, ballots and voting tabulations that\nidentify shareholders are kept permanently\nconfidential, except as follows: to meet legal\nrequirements, to assert claims for or defend\nclaims against our company, to allow\nauthorized individuals to count and certify\nthe results of the shareholder vote if a proxy\nsolicitation in opposition to the Board takes\nplace, or to respond to shareholders who have\nwritten comments on proxy cards or who have\nrequested disclosure. We also have the voting\ntabulations performed by an independent third\nparty. Who will count the votes?\nRepresentatives of Broadridge Financial\nSolutions, Inc., our tabulation agent, will\ntabulate the votes and act as independent\ninspectors of election. Who pays for the cost\nof proxy preparation and solicitation? We pay\nfor the cost of proxy preparation and\nsolicitation, including the reasonable charges\nand expenses of brokerage firms, banks, trust\ncompanies or other nominees for forwarding\nproxy materials to street name holders. We\nhave retained Alliance Advisors, LLC, to\nassist in the solicitation of proxies for the\nannual meeting for a fee of $20,000, plus\nassociated costs and expenses. We are\nsoliciting proxies primarily by mail. In\naddition, our directors, officers and\nemployees may solicit proxies by telephone,\nfacsimile, e-mail or in person. They will not\nreceive any additional compensation for these\nactivities. Do we \u201chousehold\u201d annual meeting\nmaterials? The SEC rules allow a single copy\nof the notice of Internet availability of\nproxy materials or proxy statement and annual\nreport to be delivered to multiple\nshareholders sharing the same address and last\nname, or who we reasonably believe are members\nof the same family, and who consent to receive\na single copy of these materials in a manner\nprovided by these rules. This practice is\nreferred to as \u201chouseholding.\u201d Although we do\nnot household for our registered shareholders,\nwe understand that some brokers, banks, trust\ncompanies and other nominees household U.S.\nBancorp notices of Internet availability of\nproxy materials or proxy statements and annual\nreports, delivering a single copy of each to\nmultiple shareholders sharing an address\nunless contrary instructions have been\nreceived from the affected shareholders. Once\nyou have received notice from your broker,\nbank, trust company or other nominee that it\nwill be householding materials to your\naddress, householding will continue until you\nare notified otherwise or until you revoke\nyour consent. If, at any time, you no longer\nwish to participate in householding and would\nprefer to receive a separate copy of our\nnotice of Internet availability of proxy\nmaterials or proxy statement or annual report,\nor if you are receiving multiple copies of any\nof these documents and wish to receive only\none, please notify your broker, bank, trust\ncompany or other nominee. We will deliver\npromptly upon written or oral request a\nseparate copy of our notice of Internet\navailability of proxy materials, proxy\nstatement and/or our annual report to a\nshareholder at a shared address to which a\nsingle copy was delivered.

How can\nI receive my proxy materials by e-mail in the\nfuture? Instead of receiving future paper\ncopies of the notice of Internet availability\nof proxy materials or our proxy materials by\nmail, you can elect to receive an e-mail with\nlinks to these documents, your control number\nand instructions for voting over the Internet.\nOpting to receive your proxy materials by\ne-mail will save the cost of producing and\nmailing documents to you and will also help\nconserve environmental resources.

We provide the\npercentage of revenue attributable to each\nbusiness line, excluding Treasury and\nCorporate Support, as it reflects our\ncompany\u2019s diversified mix of businesses. In\naddition, we have included the other financial\nmeasures listed above on an adjusted basis to\nexclude notable items related to the MUFG\nUnion Bank acquisition, which included losses\nrelated to balance sheet optimization, merger\nand integration-related charges, and impacts\nto the provision for credit losses recognized\nfor acquired loans and certain balance sheet\noptimization activities, in order to provide a\ngreater understanding of ongoing operations\nand better comparability with prior year\nresults. We use net interest income on a\ntaxable-equivalent basis to calculate our\nefficiency ratio because we believe that this\npresentation is the preferred industry\nmeasurement of net interest income as it\nprovides a relevant comparison of net interest\nincome arising from taxable and tax-exempt\nsources.

Statements that are not\nhistorical or current facts, including\nstatements about beliefs and expectations, are\nforward-looking statements and are based on\nthe information available to, and assumptions\nand estimates made by, management as of the\ndate hereof. These forward-looking statements\ncover, among other things, future economic\nconditions and the anticipated future revenue,\nexpenses, financial condition, asset quality,\ncapital and liquidity levels, plans, prospects\nand operations of U.S. Bancorp. Forward-\nlooking statements often use words such as\n\u201canticipates,\u201d \u201ctargets,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201chopes,\u201d\n\u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d\n\u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cgoals,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d\n\u201ccontinue\u201d and other similar expressions or\nfuture or conditional verbs such as \u201cwill,\u201d\n\u201cmay,\u201d \u201cmight,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwould\u201d and \u201ccould.\u201d\nForward-looking statements involve inherent\nrisks and uncertainties that could cause\nactual results to differ materially from those\nset forth in forward-looking statements. For\ndiscussion of the risks and uncertainties that\nmay cause actual results to differ from those\ndescribed in forward-looking statements, refer\nto the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of U.S.\nBancorp\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, and subsequent filings with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission. In\naddition, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s acquisition of MUFG\nUnion Bank presents risks and uncertainties,\nincluding, among others: the risk that the\ncost savings, any revenue synergies and other\nanticipated benefits of the acquisition may\nnot be realized or may take longer than\nanticipated to be realized; and the\npossibility that the combination of MUFG Union\nBank with U.S. Bancorp, including the\nintegration of MUFG Union Bank, may be more\ncostly or difficult to complete than\nanticipated or have unanticipated adverse\nresults. In addition, factors other than these\nrisks also could adversely affect U.S.\nBancorp\u2019s results, and the reader should not\nconsider these risks to be a complete set of\nall potential risks or uncertainties. Readers\nare cautioned not to place undue reliance on\nany forward-looking statements.
