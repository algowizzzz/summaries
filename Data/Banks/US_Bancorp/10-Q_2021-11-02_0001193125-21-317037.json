In addition, changes to statutes, \nregulations, or regulatory policies or        \npractices could affect U.S. Bancorp in        \nsubstantial and unpredictable ways. U.S.      \nBancorp\u2019s results could also be adversely     \naffected by changes in interest rates; further\nincreases in unemployment rates; deterioration\nin the credit quality of its loan portfolios  \nor in the value of the collateral securing    \nthose loans; deterioration in the value of its\ninvestment securities; legal and regulatory   \ndevelopments; litigation; increased           \ncompetition from both banks and non-          \nbanks;civil unrest; changes in customer       \nbehavior and preferences; breaches in data    \nsecurity, including as a result of work-from- \nhome arrangements; failures to safeguard      \npersonal information; effects of mergers and  \nacquisitions and related integration; effects \nof critical accounting policies and judgments;\nand management\u2019s ability to effectively manage\ncredit risk, market risk, operational risk,   \ncompliance risk, strategic risk, interest rate\nrisk, liquidity risk and reputation risk. In  \naddition, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s proposed acquisition \nof MUFG Union Bank presents risks and         \nuncertainties, including, among others: the   \nrisk that the cost savings, any revenue       \nsynergies and other anticipated benefits of   \nthe proposed acquisition may not be realized  \nor may take longer than anticipated to be     \nrealized; the risk that U.S. Bancorp\u2019s        \nbusiness could be disrupted as a result of the\nannouncement and pendency of the proposed     \nacquisition and diversion of management\u2019s     \nattention from ongoing business operations and\nopportunities; the possibility that the       \nproposed acquisition, including the           \nintegration of MUFG Union Bank, may be more   \ncostly or difficult to complete than          \nanticipated; delays in closing the proposed   \nacquisition; and the failure of required      \ngovernmental approvals to be obtained or any  \nother closing conditions in the definitive    \npurchase agreement to be satisfied. For       \ndiscussion of these and other risks that may  \ncause actual results to differ from           \nexpectations, refer to U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Annual  \nReport on Form 10-Kfor the year ended December\n31, 2020, on file with the Securities and     \nExchange Commission, including the sections   \nentitled \u201cCorporate Risk Profile\u201d and \u201cRisk   \nFactors\u201d contained in Exhibit 13, and all     \nsubsequent filings with the Securities and    \nExchange Commission under Sections 13(a),     \n13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange \nAct of 1934. In addition, factors other than  \nthese risks also could adversely affect U.S.  \nBancorp\u2019s results, and the reader should not  \nconsider these risks to be a complete set of  \nall potential risks or uncertainties.

attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $2.0   \nbillion for the third quarter of 2021, or     \n$1.30 per diluted common share, compared with \n$1.6 billion, or $0.99 per diluted common     \nshare, for the third quarter of 2020. Return  \non average assets and return on average common\nequity were 1.45 percent and 15.9 percent,    \nrespectively, for the third quarter of 2021,  \ncompared with 1.17 percent and 12.8 percent,  \nrespectively, for the third quarter of 2020.  \nTotal net revenue for the third quarter of    \n2021 was $74 million (1.2 percent) lower than \nthe third quarter of 2020, reflecting a 1.7   \npercent decrease in net interest income and a \n0.7 percent decrease in noninterest income.   \nThe decrease in net interest income from the  \nthird quarter of 2020 was due to changes in   \nloan portfolio composition and lower average  \nloan balances primarily driven by commercial  \nloan paydowns by corporate customers accessing\nthe capital markets and the Small Business    \nAdministration (\u201cSBA\u201d) Paycheck Protection    \nProgram, partially offset by changes in       \ndeposit and funding mix as well as higher loan\nfees related to the SBA Paycheck Protection   \nProgram. The noninterest income decrease was  \ndriven by lower mortgage banking revenue,     \ncommercial products revenue and other         \nnoninterest income, mostly offset by          \nimprovements in payment services revenue,     \ntrust and investment management fees, deposit \nservice charges, treasury management fees and \ninvestment products fees. Noninterest expense \nin the third quarter of 2021 was $58 million  \n(1.7 percent) higher than the third quarter of\n2020, reflecting increases in compensation    \nexpense, primarily related to performance-    \nbased incentive compensation, as well as      \nhigher professional services expense,         \nmarketing and business development expense,   \nand technology and communications expense,    \npartially offset by lower net occupancy and   \nequipment expense and other noninterest       \nexpense. The provision for credit losses for  \nthe third quarter of 2021 was a benefit of    \n$163 million, which was $798 million favorable\nfrom the third quarter of 2020, driven by a   \ndecrease in the allowance for credit losses   \nduring the third quarter of 2021 as a result  \nof continued improvement in the global        \neconomy, as well as strong credit and         \ncollateral performance, compared with an      \nincrease in the allowance for credit losses   \nduring the third quarter of 2020. Net charge- \noffs in the third quarter of 2021 were $147   \nmillion, compared with $515 million in the    \nthird quarter of 2020. Refer to \u201cCorporate    \nRisk Profile\u201d for further information on the  \nprovision for credit losses, net charge-offs, \nnonperforming assets and other factors        \nconsidered by the Company in assessing the    \ncredit quality of the loan portfolio and      \nestablishing the allowance for credit losses. \nNet income attributable to U.S. Bancorp for   \nthe first nine months of 2021 was $6.3        \nbillion, or $4.04 per diluted common share,   \ncompared with $3.4 billion, or $2.11 per      \ndiluted common share, for the first nine      \nmonths of 2020. Return on average assets and  \nreturn on average common equity were 1.53     \npercent and 17.0 percent, respectively, for   \nthe first nine months of 2021, compared with  \n0.87 percent and 9.3 percent, respectively,   \nfor the first nine months of 2020. Total net  \nrevenue for the first nine months of 2021 was \n$431 million (2.5 percent) lower than the     \nfirst nine months of 2020, reflecting a 2.9   \npercent decrease in net interest income (2.8  \npercent on a taxable-equivalent basis) and a  \n2.0 percent decrease in noninterest income.   \nThe decrease in net interest income from the  \nfirst nine months of 2020 was due to changes  \nin loan portfolio composition, lower average  \nloan balances, the impact of lower interest   \nrates compared with the prior year and higher \npremium amortization in the investment        \nportfolio related to mortgage refinance       \nactivities, partially offset by changes in    \ndeposit and funding mix as well as higher loan\nfees related to the SBA Paycheck Protection   \nProgram. The noninterest income decrease was  \ndriven by lower mortgage banking revenue,     \ncommercial products revenue and securities    \ngains, partially offset by improvements in    \npayment services revenue, trust and investment\nmanagement fees, treasury management fees,    \ninvestment products fees, deposit service     \ncharges and other noninterest income.         \nNoninterest expense in the first nine months  \nof 2021 was $190 million (1.9 percent) higher \nthan the first nine months of 2020, reflecting\nincreases in compensation expense, technology \nand communications expense, professional      \nservices expense, and marketing and business  \ndevelopment expense, partially offset by lower\nnet occupancy and equipment expense and other \nnoninterest expense.                          \n                     \n  4    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe provision for credit losses for the first \nnine months of 2021 was a benefit of $1.2     \nbillion, which was $4.5 billion favorable     \ncompared to the first nine months of 2020,    \ndriven by a decrease in the allowance for     \ncredit losses during the first nine months of \n2021 as a result of improvement in the global \neconomy and strong credit and collateral      \nperformance, compared with an increase in the \nallowance for credit losses during the first  \nnine months of 2020. Net charge-offs in the   \nfirst nine months of 2021 were $550 million,  \ncompared with $1.3 billion in the first nine  \nmonths of 2020.

Upon close of the       \ntransaction, MUFG will hold approximately 2.9 \npercent of the Company\u2019s common stock. The    \ntransaction excludes the purchase of MUFG     \nUnion Bank\u2019s Global Corporate & Investment    \nBank, certain middle and back office          \nfunctions, and other assets. MUFG Union Bank  \ncurrently has approximately 300 branches in   \nCalifornia, Washington and Oregon and is      \nexpected to add, based on MUFG Union Bank\u2019s   \nJune 30, 2021 balance sheet, approximately    \n$105 billion in total assets, $58 billion of  \nloans and $90 billion of deposits to the      \nCompany\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. The     \ntransaction is expected to close in the first \nhalf of 2022, subject to customary closing    \nconditions, including regulatory approvals.   \nSTATEMENT OF INCOME ANALYSIS Net Interest     \nIncome Net interest income, on a taxable-     \nequivalent basis, was $3.2 billion in the     \nthird quarter and $9.5 billion in the first   \nnine months of 2021, representing decreases of\n$55 million (1.7 percent) and $273 million    \n(2.8 percent), respectively, compared with the\nsame periods of 2020. The decreases were      \nprimarily due to changes in loan mix and lower\naverage loan balances driven by commercial    \nloan paydowns by corporate customers accessing\nthe capital markets and the SBA Paycheck      \nProtection Program, partially offset by       \nchanges in deposit and funding mix as well as \nhigher loan fees related to the SBA Paycheck  \nProtection Program. Net interest income       \nfurther decreased in the first nine months of \n2021, compared with the first nine months of  \n2020, due to higher premium amortization      \nrelated to securities prepayments and the     \nimpact of lower interest rates compared with  \nthe prior year. Average earning assets were   \n$17.2 billion (3.5 percent) higher in the     \nthird quarter and $24.6 billion (5.2 percent) \nhigher in the first nine months of 2021,      \ncompared with the same periods of 2020,       \nreflecting increases in investment securities \nand other earning assets, primarily driven by \nhigher cash balances, while average loans     \ndecreased due to continued paydowns by        \ncorporate customers. The net interest margin, \non a taxable-equivalent basis, in the third   \nquarter and first nine months of 2021 was 2.53\npercent and 2.52 percent, respectively,       \ncompared with 2.67 percent and 2.73 percent in\nthe third quarter and first nine months of    \n2020, respectively. The decrease in net       \ninterest margin from the prior year was       \nprimarily due to the impact of declining      \ninterest rates on loan yields, the mix of     \nearning assets and lower reinvestment yields  \nin the investment portfolio, partially offset \nby the net benefit of funding composition and \nhigher loan fees. The decrease in net interest\nmargin in the first nine months of 2021,      \ncompared with the first nine months of 2020,  \nwas further due to higher premium amortization\nwithin the investment portfolio. Refer to the \n\u201cConsolidated Daily Average Balance Sheet and \nRelated Yields and Rates\u201d tables for further  \ninformation on net interest income. Average   \ntotal loans in the third quarter and first    \nnine months of 2021 were $14.3 billion (4.6   \npercent) and $13.9 billion (4.5 percent)      \nlower, respectively, than the same periods of \n2020. The decreases were primarily due to     \nlower commercial loans driven by continued    \npaydowns by corporate customers that accessed \nthe capital markets and the SBA Paycheck      \nProtection Program, lower commercial real     \nestate loans as a result of customer paydowns,\nand lower credit card loans driven by higher  \ncustomer payment rates. Average total loans   \nfurther decreased in the third quarter of     \n2021, compared with the third quarter of 2020,\ndue to lower residential mortgages driven by  \npaydowns. These decreases were partially      \noffset by higher other retail loans, driven by\ngrowth in installment loans due to strong auto\nand recreational vehicle lending, partially   \noffset by lower home equity and second        \nmortgages as more customers chose to refinance\ntheir existing first lien residential mortgage\nbalances during the prior year due to the low \ninterest rate environment. Average investment \nsecurities in the third quarter and first nine\nmonths of 2021 were $23.2 billion (18.0       \npercent) and $29.2 billion (23.7 percent)     \nhigher, respectively, than the same periods of\n2020, primarily due to purchases of mortgage- \nbacked, U.S. Treasury and state and political \nsecurities, net of prepayments and maturities.\n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    5  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                 \n  Table\u00a02    Noninterest Income  \n                                 \n                                              \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      \u2026      $      $      \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n      $      $      \u2026      $      $      \u2026    \n                                              \nAverage total deposits for the third quarter  \nand first nine months of 2021 were $26.0      \nbillion (6.4 percent) and $38.4 billion (9.8  \npercent) higher, respectively, than the same  \nperiods of 2020, including the acquisition of \ndeposit balances from State Farm Bank in the  \nfourth quarter of 2020. Average noninterest-  \nbearing deposits for the third quarter and    \nfirst nine months of 2021 were $19.6 billion  \n(18.0 percent) and $31.3 billion (33.7        \npercent) higher, respectively, than the same  \nperiods of 2020, primarily due to higher      \nCorporate and Commercial Banking, and Wealth  \nManagement and Investment Services balances.  \nThe increase in noninterest-bearing deposits  \nin the third quarter of 2021, compared with   \nthe third quarter of 2020, was partially      \noffset by a decrease in Payment Services      \nbalances. Average total savings deposits for  \nthe third quarter and first nine months of    \n2021 were $16.9 billion (6.4 percent) and     \n$21.6 billion (8.4 percent) higher,           \nrespectively, than the same periods of the    \nprior year, driven by increases in Consumer   \nand Business Banking balances, partially      \noffset by decreases in Corporate and          \nCommercial Banking balances. The growth in    \naverage noninterest-bearing and total savings \ndeposits was primarily a result of the actions\nby the federal government to increase         \nliquidity in the financial system and         \ngovernment stimulus programs. Average time    \ndeposits for the third quarter and first nine \nmonths of 2021 were $10.5 billion (31.0       \npercent) and $14.5 billion (36.7 percent)     \nlower, respectively, than the same periods of \n2020, primarily driven by decreases in those  \ndeposits managed as an alternative to other   \nfunding sources, based largely on relative    \npricing and liquidity characteristics.        \nProvision for Credit Losses The provision for \ncredit losses was a benefit of $163 million   \nfor the third quarter and $1.2 billion for the\nfirst nine months of 2021, representing       \ndecreases of $798 million and $4.5 billion,   \nrespectively, from the same periods of 2020.  \nThe decreases were driven by the Company      \ndecreasing the allowance for credit losses in \n2021 as a result of improvement in the global \neconomy, as well as strong credit and         \ncollateral performance, compared with the     \nCompany increasing the allowance for credit   \nlosses in 2020 due to deteriorating economic  \nconditions related to COVID-19.Net charge-offs\ndecreased $368 million (71.5 percent) and $795\nmillion (59.1 percent) in the third quarter   \nand first nine months of 2021, respectively,  \ncompared with the same periods of the prior   \nyear, reflecting improvement across all loan  \ncategories. Refer to \u201cCorporate Risk Profile\u201d \nfor further information on the provision for  \ncredit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming \nassets and other factors considered by the    \nCompany in assessing the credit quality of the\nloan portfolio and establishing the allowance \nfor credit losses. Noninterest Income         \nNoninterest income was $2.7 billion in the    \nthird quarter and $7.7 billion in the first   \nnine months of 2021, representing decreases of\n$19 million (0.7 percent) and $158 million    \n(2.0 percent), respectively, compared with the\nsame periods of 2020. The decreases from a    \nyear ago reflected lower mortgage banking     \nrevenue and commercial products revenue,      \npartially offset by higher payment services   \nrevenue, trust and investment management fees,\ndeposit service charges, treasury management  \nfees and investment products fees. The        \ndecrease in noninterest income in the first   \nnine months of 2021, compared with the first  \nnine months of 2020, was also due to lower    \nsecurities gains. Mortgage banking revenue    \ndecreased in the third quarter of 2021,       \ncompared with the third quarter of 2020,      \ndriven by lower production volume and related \ngain on sale margins, partially offset by     \nincreases in mortgage servicing rights        \n(\u201cMSRs\u201d) valuations, net of hedging           \nactivities, as well as gains on higher        \nGovernment National Mortgage Association      \n(\u201cGNMA\u201d) loan sales. The decrease in mortgage \nbanking revenue in the first nine months of   \n2021, compared with the first nine months of  \n2020, was due to lower production volume and  \nrelated gain on sale margins, along with      \ndeclines in MSR valuations, net of hedging    \nactivities.

The   \ndecrease in commercial products revenue in the\nfirst nine months of 2021, compared with the  \nfirst nine months of 2020, was further offset \nby higher non-yieldloan fees as a result of   \nhigher unused commitments. Other noninterest  \nincome decreased in the third quarter of 2021,\ncompared with the third quarter of 2020,      \nprimarily due to the third quarter of 2020    \nimpact of higher equity investment income and \ntransition services agreement revenue         \nassociated with the sale of the Company\u2019s ATM \nthird-party servicing business, partially     \noffset by certain asset impairments as a      \nresult of branch optimization, and higher     \nretail leasing end of term residual gains in  \nthe third quarter of 2021. During 2020,       \npayment services revenue had been adversely   \naffected by the impact of the COVID-19pandemic\non consumer and business spending,            \nparticularly related to travel and            \nentertainment activities. However, spending   \nhas continued to strengthen across most       \nsectors driven by government stimulus, local  \njurisdictions reducing restrictions and       \nconsumer behaviors normalizing. As a result,  \npayment services revenue increased in the     \nthird quarter and first nine months of 2021,  \ncompared with the same periods of 2020. The   \ncomponents of payment services revenue        \nincluded higher credit and debit card revenue \ndriven by higher net interchange revenue      \nrelated to sales volume as well as stronger   \ntransaction and cash advance fees, partially  \noffset by lower prepaid card processing       \nactivities as government stimulus programs    \ndissipated, as well as higher investment in   \ncustomer acquisition. Corporate payment       \nproducts revenue increased primarily due to   \nimproving business spending, while merchant   \nprocessing services revenue increased driven  \nby higher sales volume as well as higher      \nmerchant and equipment fees. Trust and        \ninvestment management fees increased primarily\ndue to business growth and favorable market   \nconditions, while deposit service charges     \nincreased primarily due to higher customer    \nactivity and ATM processing revenue. Treasury \nmanagement fees increased due to core growth  \ndriven by the COVID-19economic recovery, while\ninvestment products fees increased primarily  \ndriven by favorable market conditions and core\ngrowth. Noninterest Expense Noninterest       \nexpense was $3.4 billion in the third quarter \nand $10.2 billion in the first nine months of \n2021, representing increases of $58 million   \n(1.7 percent) and $190 million (1.9 percent), \nrespectively, over the same periods of 2020.  \nThe increases from the prior year reflected   \nhigher compensation expense, professional     \nservices expense, marketing and business      \ndevelopment expense, and technology and       \ncommunications expense, partially offset by   \nlower net occupancy and equipment expense, and\nother noninterest expense. Compensation       \nexpense increased due to higher performance-  \nbased incentives, merit increases and revenue-\nrelated compensation driven by business       \nproduction. Professional services expense     \nincreased primarily due to an increase in     \nbusiness investment and related initiatives in\nthe third quarter of 2021. Marketing and      \nbusiness development expense increased due to \nthe timing of marketing campaigns supporting  \nbusiness development and lower marketing      \nactivities in 2020 during the pandemic.       \nTechnology and communications expense         \nincreased primarily due to higher expenditures\nsupporting business technology investments.   \nEmployee benefits expense increased in the    \nfirst nine months of 2021, compared with the  \nfirst nine months of 2020, primarily due to   \nhigher payroll taxes and related benefits, and\nhigher pension expense. Net occupancy and     \nequipment expense decreased in the third      \nquarter and first nine months of 2021,        \ncompared with the same periods of the prior   \nyear, primarily due to                        \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    7  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nbranch closures. Other noninterest expense    \ndecreased primarily due to higher             \nCOVID-19related expenses in 2020 including    \nrecognizing liabilities related to future     \ndelivery exposures for merchant and airline   \nprocessing, as well as lower costs related to \ntax-advantagedprojects which were scaled back \nin 2020 during the pandemic. Income Tax       \nExpense The provision for income taxes was    \n$564 million (an effective rate of 21.7       \npercent) for the third quarter and $1.7       \nbillion (an effective rate of 21.4 percent)   \nfor the first nine months of 2021, compared   \nwith $347 million (an effective rate of 18.0  \npercent) and $671 million (an effective rate  \nof 16.2 percent) for the same periods of 2020,\nrespectively. The increases in the tax rates  \nwere due to the marginal impact of providing  \ntaxes on higher pretax earnings in 2021. For  \nfurther information on income taxes, refer to \nNote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements. BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS Loans The  \nCompany\u2019s loan portfolio was $297.6 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2021, compared with $297.7      \nbillion at December 31, 2020, a decrease of   \n$99 million. The decrease was driven by lower \ncommercial loans, residential mortgages,      \ncommercial real estate loans and credit card  \nloans, partially offset by higher other retail\nloans. Commercial loans decreased $1.9 billion\n(1.8 percent) at September 30, 2021, compared \nwith December 31, 2020, reflecting paydowns by\ncorporate customers that accessed the capital \nmarkets and the SBA Paycheck Protection       \nProgram during the first nine months of 2021. \nResidential mortgages held in the loan        \nportfolio decreased $1.2 billion (1.6 percent)\nat September 30, 2021, compared with December \n31, 2020, due to customers paying down        \nbalances in the first nine months of 2021.    \nResidential mortgages originated and placed in\nthe Company\u2019s loan portfolio include well-    \nsecured jumbo mortgages and branch-originated \nfirst lien home equity loans to borrowers with\nhigh credit quality. Commercial real estate   \nloans decreased $503 million (1.3 percent) at \nSeptember 30, 2021, compared with December 31,\n2020, the result of customers paying down     \nbalances. Credit card loans decreased $209    \nmillion (0.9 percent) at September 30, 2021,  \ncompared with December 31, 2020, reflecting   \nhigher customer payment rates. Other retail   \nloans increased $3.7 billion (6.4 percent) at \nSeptember 30, 2021, compared with December 31,\n2020, due to increases in auto loans and      \ninstallment loans, partially offset by        \ndecreases in home equity loans and retail     \nleasing balances. The Company generally       \nretains portfolio loans through maturity;     \nhowever, the Company\u2019s intent may change over \ntime based upon various factors such as       \nongoing asset/liability management activities,\nassessment of product profitability, credit   \nrisk, liquidity needs, and capital            \nimplications. If the Company\u2019s intent or      \nability to hold an existing portfolio loan    \nchanges, it is transferred to loans held for  \nsale. Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale,\nconsisting primarily of residential mortgages \nto be sold in the secondary market, were $6.2 \nbillion at September 30, 2021, compared with  \n$8.8 billion at December 31, 2020. The        \ndecrease in loans held for sale was           \nprincipally due to a lower level of mortgage  \nloan closings in the third quarter of 2021,   \ncompared with the fourth quarter of 2020.     \nAlmost all of the residential mortgage loans  \nthe Company originates or purchases for sale  \nfollow guidelines that allow the loans to be  \nsold into existing, highly liquid secondary   \nmarkets; in particular in government agency   \ntransactions and to government-sponsored      \nenterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d). Investment Securities   \nAvailable-for-saleinvestment securities       \ntotaled $149.4 billion at September 30, 2021, \ncompared with $136.8 billion at December 31,  \n2020. The $12.5 billion (9.2 percent) increase\nwas primarily due to $15.7 billion of net     \ninvestment purchases, partially offset by a   \n$3.1 billion unfavorable change in net        \nunrealized gains (losses) on available-for-   \nsaleinvestment securities. The Company had no \noutstanding investment securities classified  \nas held-to-maturityat September 30, 2021 and  \nDecember 31, 2020. The Company\u2019s available-   \nfor-saleinvestment securities are carried at  \nfair value with changes in fair value         \nreflected in other comprehensive income (loss)\nunless a portion of a security\u2019s unrealized   \nloss is related to credit and an allowance for\ncredit losses is necessary. At September 30,  \n2021, the Company\u2019s net unrealized gains on   \navailable-for-saleinvestment securities were  \n$138 million, compared with $3.2 billion at   \nDecember 31, 2020. The unfavorable change in  \nnet unrealized gains (losses) was primarily   \ndue to decreases in the fair value of         \nmortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities  \nas a result of changes in interest rates.     \nGross unrealized losses on available-for-     \nsaleinvestment securities totaled $1.7 billion\nat September 30, 2021, compared with $53      \nmillion at December 31, 2020. At September 30,\n2021, the Company had no plans to sell        \nsecurities with unrealized losses, and        \nbelieves it is more likely than not that it   \nwould not be required to sell such securities \nbefore recovery of their amortized cost.

The $13.1       \nbillion (3.1 percent) increase in total       \ndeposits reflected increases in noninterest-  \nbearing and total savings deposits, partially \noffset by a decrease in time deposits.        \nNoninterest-bearing deposits increased $17.5  \nbillion (14.8 percent) at September 30, 2021, \ncompared with December 31, 2020, primarily due\nto higher Corporate and Commercial Banking,   \nWealth Management and Investment Services, and\nConsumer and Business Banking balances.       \nInterest checking balances increased $7.8     \nbillion (8.2 percent) while savings account   \nbalances increased $7.0 billion (12.4         \npercent), both driven by higher Consumer and  \nBusiness Banking balances. Money market       \ndeposit balances decreased $11.4 billion (8.9 \npercent) at September 30, 2021, compared with \nDecember 31, 2020, primarily due to lower     \nWealth Management and Investment Services, and\nCorporate and Commercial Banking balances.    \nTime deposits decreased $7.8 billion (25.5    \npercent) at September 30, 2021, compared with \nDecember 31, 2020, driven by a decrease in    \nthose deposits managed as an alternative to   \nother funding sources, based largely on       \nrelative pricing and liquidity                \ncharacteristics, along with a decrease in     \nConsumer and Business Banking balances.       \nBorrowings The Company utilizes both short-   \nterm and long-term borrowings as part of its  \nasset/liability management and funding        \nstrategies. Short-term borrowings, which      \ninclude federal funds purchased, commercial   \npaper, repurchase agreements, borrowings      \nsecured by high-grade assets and other short- \nterm borrowings, were $16.1 billion at        \nSeptember 30, 2021, compared with $11.8       \nbillion at December 31, 2020. The $4.3 billion\n(36.7 percent) increase in short-term         \nborrowings was primarily due to higher        \ncommercial paper, repurchase agreement and    \nfederal funds purchased balances. Long-term   \ndebt was $35.7 billion at September 30, 2021, \ncompared with $41.3 billion at December 31,   \n2020. The $5.6 billion (13.6 percent) decrease\nwas primarily due to $3.7 billion of bank note\nrepayments and maturities, $1.5 billion of    \nmedium-term note repayments and a $1.0 billion\ndecrease in Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d)   \nadvances, partially offset by $1.0 billion of \nbank note issuances.

CORPORATE\nRISK PROFILE Overview Managing risks is an    \nessential part of successfully operating a    \nfinancial services company. The Company\u2019s     \nBoard of Directors has approved a risk        \nmanagement framework which establishes        \ngovernance and risk management requirements   \nfor all risk-taking activities. This framework\nincludes Company and business line risk       \nappetite statements which set boundaries for  \nthe types and amount of risk that may be      \nundertaken in pursuing business objectives and\ninitiatives. The Board of Directors, primarily\nthrough its Risk Management Committee,        \noversees performance relative to the risk     \nmanagement framework, risk appetite           \nstatements, and other policy requirements. The\nExecutive Risk Committee (\u201cERC\u201d), which is    \nchaired by the Chief Risk Officer and includes\nthe Chief Executive Officer and other members \nof the executive management team, oversees    \nexecution against the risk management         \nframework and risk appetite statements. The   \nERC focuses on current and emerging risks,    \nincluding strategic and reputation risks, by  \ndirecting timely and comprehensive actions.   \nSenior operating committees have also been    \nestablished, each responsible for overseeing a\nspecified category of risk.                   \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    9  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s most prominent risk exposures   \nare credit, interest rate, market, liquidity, \noperational, compliance, strategic, and       \nreputation. Leveraging the Company\u2019s risk     \nmanagement framework, the specific impacts of \nCOVID-19and related risks are identified for  \neach of the most prominent exposures. With    \nrespect to direct impacts from                \nCOVID-19,oversight and governance is managed  \nthrough a centralized command center with     \nfrequent reporting to the Managing Committee  \nand ERC. The Board of Directors also oversees \nthe Company\u2019s responsiveness to the           \nCOVID-19pandemic. Credit risk is the risk of  \nloss associated with a change in the credit   \nprofile or the failure of a borrower or       \ncounterparty to meet its contractual          \nobligations. Interest rate risk is the current\nor prospective risk to earnings and capital,  \nor market valuations, arising from the impact \nof changes in interest rates. Market risk     \narises from fluctuations in interest rates,   \nforeign exchange rates, and security prices   \nthat may result in changes in the values of   \nfinancial instruments, such as trading and    \navailable-for-salesecurities, mortgage loans  \nheld for sale (\u201cMLHFS\u201d), MSRs and derivatives \nthat are accounted for on a fair value basis. \nLiquidity risk is the risk that financial     \ncondition or overall safety and soundness is  \nadversely affected by the Company\u2019s inability,\nor perceived inability, to meet its cash flow \nobligations in a timely and complete manner in\neither normal or stressed conditions.         \nOperational risk is the risk to current or    \nprojected financial condition and resilience  \narising from inadequate or failed internal    \nprocesses or systems, people (including human \nerrors or misconduct), or adverse external    \nevents, including the risk of loss resulting  \nfrom breaches in data security. Operational   \nrisk can also include the risk of loss due to \nfailures by third parties with which the      \nCompany does business. Compliance risk is the \nrisk that the Company may suffer legal or     \nregulatory sanctions, financial losses, and   \nreputational damage if it fails to adhere to  \ncompliance requirements and the Company\u2019s     \ncompliance policies. Strategic risk is the    \nrisk to current or projected financial        \ncondition and resilience arising from adverse \nbusiness decisions, poor implementation of    \nbusiness decisions, or lack of responsiveness \nto changes in the banking industry and        \noperating environment. Reputation risk is the \nrisk to current or anticipated earnings,      \ncapital, or franchise or enterprise value     \narising from negative public opinion. This    \nrisk may impair the Company\u2019s competitiveness \nby affecting its ability to establish new     \nrelationships or services, or continue serving\nexisting relationships. In addition to the    \nrisks identified above, other risk factors    \nexist that may impact the Company. Refer to   \n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report \non Form 10-Kfor the year ended December 31,   \n2020, for a detailed discussion of these      \nfactors. The Company\u2019s Board and management-  \nlevel governance committees are supported by a\n\u201cthree lines of defense\u201d model for            \nestablishing effective checks and balances.   \nThe first line of defense, the business lines,\nmanages risks in conformity with established  \nlimits and policy requirements. In turn,      \nbusiness line leaders and their risk officers \nestablish programs to ensure conformity with  \nthese limits and policy requirements. The     \nsecond line of defense, which includes the    \nChief Risk Officer\u2019s organization as well as  \npolicy and oversight activities of corporate  \nsupport functions, translates risk appetite   \nand strategy into actionable risk limits and  \npolicies. The second line of defense monitors \nfirst line of defense conformity with limits  \nand policies, and provides reporting and      \nescalation of emerging risks and other        \nconcerns to senior management and the Risk    \nManagement Committee of the Board of          \nDirectors. The third line of defense, internal\naudit, is responsible for providing the Audit \nCommittee of the Board of Directors and senior\nmanagement with independent assessment and    \nassurance regarding the effectiveness of the  \nCompany\u2019s governance, risk management and     \ncontrol processes. Management regularly       \nprovides reports to the Risk Management       \nCommittee of the Board of Directors. The Risk \nManagement Committee discusses with management\nthe Company\u2019s risk management performance, and\nprovides a summary of key risks to the entire \nBoard of Directors, covering the status of    \nexisting matters, areas of potential future   \nconcern and specific information on certain   \ntypes of loss events. The Risk Management     \nCommittee considers quarterly reports by      \nmanagement assessing the Company\u2019s performance\nrelative to the risk appetite statements and  \nthe associated risk limits, including:        \n                                              \n       Macroeconomic environment and other    \n       qualitative considerations, such as    \n  \u2022    regulatory and compliance changes,     \n       litigation developments, and           \n       technology and cybersecurity;          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit measures, including adversely   \n  \u2022    rated and nonperforming loans,         \n       leveraged transactions, credit         \n       concentrations and lending limits;     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Interest rate and market risk,         \n  \u2022    including market value and net income  \n       simulation, and trading-related Value  \n       at Risk (\u201cVaR\u201d);                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Liquidity risk, including funding      \n  \u2022    projections under various stressed     \n       scenarios;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       Operational and compliance risk,       \n       including losses stemming from events  \n       such as fraud, processing errors,      \n       control breaches, breaches in data     \n  \u2022    security or adverse business           \n       decisions, as well as reporting on     \n       technology performance, and various    \n       legal and regulatory compliance        \n       measures;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Capital ratios and projections,        \n  \u2022    including regulatory measures and      \n       stressed scenarios; and                \n                                              \n                      \n  10    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Strategic and reputation risk          \n  \u2022    considerations, impacts and            \n       responses.                             \n                                              \nCredit Risk Management The Company\u2019s strategy \nfor credit risk management includes well-     \ndefined, centralized credit policies, uniform \nunderwriting criteria, and ongoing risk       \nmonitoring and review processes for all       \ncommercial and consumer credit exposures. In  \nevaluating its credit risk, the Company       \nconsiders changes, if any, in underwriting    \nactivities, the loan portfolio composition    \n(including product mix and geographic,        \nindustry or customer-specific concentrations),\ncollateral values, trends in loan performance \nand macroeconomic factors, such as changes in \nunemployment rates, gross domestic product    \nlevels and consumer bankruptcy filings, as    \nwell as the potential impact on customers and \nthe domestic economy resulting from the       \nCOVID-19pandemic. The Risk Management         \nCommittee oversees the Company\u2019s credit risk  \nmanagement process. In addition, credit       \nquality ratings as defined by the Company, are\nan important part of the Company\u2019s overall    \ncredit risk management and evaluation of its  \nallowance for credit losses. Loans with a pass\nrating represent those loans not classified on\nthe Company\u2019s rating scale for problem        \ncredits, as minimal credit risk has been      \nidentified. Loans with a special mention or   \nclassified rating, including consumer lending \nand small business loans that are 90 days or  \nmore past due and still accruing, nonaccrual  \nloans, those loans considered troubled debt   \nrestructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d), and loans in a junior\nlien position that are current but are behind \na first lien position on nonaccrual, encompass\nall loans held by the Company that it         \nconsiders to have a potential or well-defined \nweakness that may put full collection of      \ncontractual cash flows at risk. The Company\u2019s \ninternal credit quality ratings for consumer  \nloans are primarily based on delinquency and  \nnonperforming status, except for a limited    \npopulation of larger loans within those       \nportfolios that are individually evaluated.   \nFor this limited population, the determination\nof the internal credit quality rating may also\nconsider collateral value and customer cash   \nflows. Refer to Note 5 in the Notes to        \nConsolidated Financial Statements for further \ndiscussion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolios   \nincluding internal credit quality ratings.

The Company manages its credit     \nrisk, in part, through diversification of its \nloan portfolio which is achieved through limit\nsetting by product type criteria, such as     \nindustry, and identification of credit        \nconcentrations. As part of its normal business\nactivities, the Company offers a broad array  \nof lending products. The Company categorizes  \nits loan portfolio into two segments, which is\nthe level at which it develops and documents a\nsystematic methodology to determine the       \nallowance for credit losses. The Company\u2019s two\nloan portfolio segments are commercial lending\nand consumer lending. The commercial lending  \nsegment includes loans and leases made to     \nsmall business, middle market, large          \ncorporate, commercial real estate, financial  \ninstitution, non-profitand public sector      \ncustomers. Key risk characteristics relevant  \nto commercial lending segment loans include   \nthe industry and geography of the borrower\u2019s  \nbusiness, purpose of the loan, repayment      \nsource, borrower\u2019s debt capacity and financial\nflexibility, loan covenants, and nature of    \npledged collateral, if any, as well as        \nmacroeconomic factors such as unemployment    \nrates, gross domestic product levels,         \ncorporate bond spreads and long-term interest \nrates, all of which have been impacted by the \nCOVID-19pandemic. These risk characteristics, \namong others, are considered in determining   \nestimates about the likelihood of default by  \nthe borrowers and the severity of loss in the \nevent of default. The Company considers these \nrisk characteristics in assigning internal    \nrisk ratings to, or forecasting losses on,    \nthese loans, which are the significant factors\nin determining the allowance for credit losses\nfor loans in the commercial lending segment.  \nThe consumer lending segment represents loans \nand leases made to consumer customers,        \nincluding residential mortgages, credit card  \nloans, and other retail loans such as         \nrevolving consumer lines, auto loans and      \nleases, home equity loans and lines, and      \nstudent loans, a run-offportfolio. Home equity\nor second mortgage loans are junior lien      \nclosed-endaccounts fully disbursed at         \norigination. These loans typically are fixed  \nrate loans, secured by residential real       \nestate, with a 10-or 15-yearfixed payment     \namortization schedule. Home equity lines are  \nrevolving accounts giving the borrower the    \nability to draw and repay balances repeatedly,\nup to a maximum commitment, and are secured by\nresidential real estate. These include        \naccounts in either a first or junior lien     \nposition. Typical terms on home equity lines  \nin the portfolio are variable rates           \nbenchmarked to the prime rate, with a 10-or   \n15-yeardraw period during which a minimum     \npayment is equivalent to the monthly interest,\nfollowed by a 20-or 10-yearamortization       \nperiod, respectively. At September 30, 2021,  \nsubstantially all of the Company\u2019s home equity\nlines were in the draw period. Approximately  \n$1.2 billion, or 12 percent, of the           \noutstanding home equity line balances at      \nSeptember 30, 2021, will enter the            \namortization period within the next 36 months.\nKey risk characteristics relevant to consumer \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    11  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nlending segment loans primarily relate to the \nborrowers\u2019 capacity and willingness to repay  \nand include unemployment rates, consumer      \nbankruptcy filings and other macroeconomic    \nfactors, customer payment history and credit  \nscores, and in some cases, updated loan-to-   \nvalue(\u201cLTV\u201d) information reflecting current   \nmarket conditions on real estate-based loans. \nThese and other risk characteristics,         \nincluding risk resulting from the             \nCOVID-19pandemic, are reflected in forecasts  \nof delinquency levels, bankruptcies and losses\nwhich are the primary factors in determining  \nthe allowance for credit losses for the       \nconsumer lending segment. The Company further \ndisaggregates its loan portfolio segments into\nvarious classes based on their underlying risk\ncharacteristics. The two classes within the   \ncommercial lending segment are commercial     \nloans and commercial real estate loans. The   \nthree classes within the consumer lending     \nsegment are residential mortgages, credit card\nloans and other retail loans. The Company\u2019s   \nconsumer lending segment utilizes several     \ndistinct business processes and channels to   \noriginate consumer credit, including          \ntraditional branch lending, mobile and on-    \nlinebanking, indirect lending, alliance       \npartnerships, correspondent banks and loan    \nbrokers. Each distinct underwriting and       \norigination activity manages unique credit    \nrisk characteristics and prices its loan      \nproduction commensurate with the differing    \nrisk profiles. Residential mortgage           \noriginations are generally limited to prime   \nborrowers and are performed through the       \nCompany\u2019s branches, loan production offices,  \nmobile and on-lineservices and a wholesale    \nnetwork of originators. The Company may retain\nresidential mortgage loans it originates on   \nits balance sheet or sell the loans into the  \nsecondary market while retaining the servicing\nrights and customer relationships. Utilizing  \nthe secondary markets enables the Company to  \neffectively reduce its credit and other       \nasset/liability risks. For residential        \nmortgages that are retained in the Company\u2019s  \nportfolio and for home equity and second      \nmortgages, credit risk is also diversified by \ngeography and managed by adherence to LTV and \nborrower credit criteria during the           \nunderwriting process. The Company estimates   \nupdated LTV information on its outstanding    \nresidential mortgages quarterly, based on a   \nmethod that combines automated valuation model\nupdates and relevant home price indices. LTV  \nis the ratio of the loan\u2019s outstanding        \nprincipal balance to the current estimate of  \nproperty value. For home equity and second    \nmortgages, combined loan-to-value(\u201cCLTV\u201d) is  \nthe combination of the first mortgage original\nprincipal balance and the second lien         \noutstanding principal balance, relative to the\ncurrent estimate of property value. Certain   \nloans do not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily   \ndue to lack of availability of relevant       \nautomated valuation model and/or home price   \nindices values, or lack of necessary valuation\ndata on acquired loans. The following tables  \nprovide summary information of residential    \nmortgages and home equity and second mortgages\nby LTV at September 30, 2021:                 \n

collection of amounts due when a \nborrower is experiencing financial            \ndifficulties or is expected to experience     \ndifficulties in the near-term. In most cases  \nthe modification is either a concessionary    \nreduction in interest rate, extension of the  \nmaturity date or reduction in the principal   \nbalance that would otherwise not be           \nconsidered. Troubled Debt Restructurings      \nConcessionary modifications are classified as \nTDRs unless the modification results in only  \nan insignificant delay in the payments to be  \nreceived. TDRs accrue interest if the borrower\ncomplies with the revised terms and conditions\nand has demonstrated repayment performance at \na level commensurate with the modified terms  \nover several payment cycles, which is         \ngenerally six months or greater. At September \n30, 2021, performing TDRs were $3.3 billion,  \ncompared with $3.6 billion at December 31,    \n2020. The Company continues to work with      \ncustomers to modify loans for borrowers who   \nare experiencing financial difficulties. Many \nof the Company\u2019s TDRs are determined on a     \ncase-by-casebasis in connection with ongoing  \nloan collection processes. The modifications  \nvary within each of the Company\u2019s loan        \nclasses. Commercial lending segment TDRs      \ngenerally include extensions of the maturity  \ndate and may be accompanied by an increase or \ndecrease to the interest rate. The Company may\nalso work with the borrower to make other     \nchanges to the loan to mitigate losses, such  \nas obtaining additional collateral and/or     \nguarantees to support the loan. The Company   \nhas also implemented certain residential      \nmortgage loan restructuring programs that may \nresult in TDRs. The Company modifies          \nresidential mortgage loans under Federal      \nHousing Administration, United States         \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and its own   \ninternal programs. Under these programs, the  \nCompany offers qualifying homeowners the      \nopportunity to permanently modify their loan  \nand achieve more affordable monthly payments  \nby providing loan concessions. These          \nconcessions may include adjustments to        \ninterest rates, conversion of adjustable rates\nto fixed rates, extensions of maturity dates  \nor deferrals of payments, capitalization of   \naccrued interest and/or outstanding advances, \nor in limited situations, partial forgiveness \nof loan principal. In most instances,         \nparticipation in residential mortgage loan    \nrestructuring programs requires the customer  \nto complete a short-term trial period. A      \npermanent loan modification is contingent on  \nthe customer successfully completing the trial\nperiod arrangement, and the loan documents are\nnot modified until that time. The Company     \nreports loans in a trial period arrangement as\nTDRs and continues to report them as TDRs     \nafter the trial period.                       \n                      \n  14    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCredit card and other retail loan TDRs are    \ngenerally part of distinct restructuring      \nprograms providing customers modification     \nsolutions over a specified time period,       \ngenerally up to 60 months. In accordance with \nregulatory guidance, the Company considers    \nsecured consumer loans that have had debt     \ndischarged through bankruptcy where the       \nborrower has not reaffirmed the debt to be    \nTDRs. If the loan amount exceeds the          \ncollateral value, the loan is charged down to \ncollateral value and the remaining amount is  \nreported as nonperforming. Loan modifications \nor concessions granted to customers resulting \ndirectly from the effects of the              \nCOVID-19pandemic, who were otherwise in       \ncurrent payment status, are not considered to \nbe TDRs.

\nTDRs, in limited circumstances, to assist     \nborrowers experiencing temporary hardships.   \nShort-term consumer lending modification      \nprograms include payment reductions, deferrals\nof up to three past due payments, and the     \nability to return to current status if the    \nborrower makes required payments. The Company \nmay also make short-term modifications to     \ncommercial lending loans, with the most common\nmodification being an extension of the        \nmaturity date of three months or less. Such   \nextensions generally are used when the        \nmaturity date is imminent and the borrower is \nexperiencing some level of financial stress,  \nbut the Company believes the borrower will pay\nall contractual amounts owed. COVID-19Payment \nRelief The Company has offered payment relief,\nincluding forbearance, payment deferrals and  \nother customer accommodations, to assist      \nborrowers that have experienced financial     \nhardship resulting from the effects of the    \nCOVID-19pandemic. The majority of these       \nborrowers were not delinquent on payments at  \nthe time they received the payment relief.    \nFrom March 2020 through September 30, 2021,   \nthe Company had approved approximately 384,000\nloan modifications for these borrowers,       \nrepresenting approximately $22.0 billion. The \nloans modified consisted primarily of payment \nforbearance or deferrals of 90 days or less. A\nportion of the borrowers who received account \nmodifications are no longer participating in  \nthese payment relief programs, as the programs\nare generally short-term; and at September 30,\n2021, approximately 19,000 accounts,          \nrepresenting approximately $3.0 billion, were \ncurrently in an active payment relief program.\nThe recognition of delinquent or nonaccrual   \nloans and loan net charge-offs may be delayed \nfor those customers enrolled in these payment \nrelief programs who would have otherwise moved\ninto past due or nonaccrual status, as these  \ncustomer accounts do not continue to age      \nduring the period the payment delay is        \nprovided.

Nonperforming assets include          \nnonaccrual loans, restructured loans not      \nperforming in accordance with modified terms  \nand not accruing interest, restructured loans \nthat have not met the performance period      \nrequired to return to accrual status, other   \nreal estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d) and other          \nnonperforming assets owned by the Company.    \nInterest payments collected from assets on    \nnonaccrual status are generally applied       \nagainst the principal balance and not recorded\nas income. However, interest income may be    \nrecognized for interest payments if the       \nremaining carrying amount of the loan is      \nbelieved to be collectible. At September 30,  \n2021, total nonperforming assets were $944    \nmillion, compared to $1.3 billion at December \n31, 2020. The $354 million (27.3 percent)     \ndecrease in nonperforming assets was driven by\ndecreases in nonperforming commercial and     \ncommercial real estate loans. The ratio of    \ntotal nonperforming assets to total loans and \nother real estate was 0.32 percent at         \nSeptember 30, 2021, compared with 0.44 percent\nat December 31, 2020. Nonperforming assets are\nexpected to continue to decline over the next \nseveral quarters. However, some manageable    \nlevels of elevated nonperforming assets in    \ncertain industries and loan categories        \nimpacted by the pandemic may experience longer\nrecovery periods. OREO was $17 million at     \nSeptember 30, 2021, compared with $24 million \nat December 31, 2020, and was related to      \nforeclosed properties that previously secured \nloan balances. These balances exclude         \nforeclosed GNMA loans whose repayments are    \nprimarily insured by the Federal Housing      \nAdministration or guaranteed by the United    \nStates Department of Veterans Affairs.

              \nAnalysis of Loan Net Charge-Offs Total loan   \nnet charge-offs were $147 million for the     \nthird quarter and $550 million for the first  \nnine months of 2021, compared with $515       \nmillion and $1.3 billion, respectively, for   \nthe same periods of 2020. The year-over-year  \ndecreases in net charge-offs reflected        \nimprovement across most loan categories,      \nassociated with improving economic conditions,\nborrower liquidity and strong asset prices in \nthe market that support repayment and recovery\non problem loans. The ratio of total loan net \ncharge-offs to average loans outstanding on an\nannualized basis for the third quarter and    \nfirst nine months of 2021 was 0.20 percent and\n0.25 percent, respectively, compared with 0.66\npercent and 0.58 percent, respectively, for   \nthe same periods of 2020. The Company expects \nnet charge-offs to return to more normalized  \nlevels over time as the beneficial impact of  \ngovernment stimulus during the pandemic       \ndissipates. Analysis and Determination of the \nAllowance for Credit Losses The allowance for \ncredit losses is established for current      \nexpected credit losses on the Company\u2019s loan  \nand lease portfolio, including unfunded credit\ncommitments. The allowance considers expected \nlosses for the remaining lives of the         \napplicable assets, inclusive of expected      \nrecoveries. The allowance for credit losses is\nincreased through provisions charged to       \nearnings and reduced by net charge-offs.      \nManagement evaluates the appropriateness of   \nthe allowance for credit losses on a quarterly\nbasis. Multiple economic scenarios are        \nconsidered over a three-year reasonable and   \nsupportable forecast period, which includes   \nincreasing consideration of historical loss   \nexperience over years two and three. These    \neconomic scenarios are constructed with       \ninterrelated projections of multiple economic \nvariables, and loss estimates are produced    \nthat consider the historical correlation of   \nthose economic variables with credit losses.  \nAfter the forecast period, the Company fully  \nreverts to long-term historical loss          \nexperience, adjusted for prepayments and      \ncharacteristics of the current loan and lease \nportfolio, to estimate losses over the        \nremaining life of the portfolio. The economic \nscenarios are updated at least quarterly and  \nare designed to provide a range of reasonable \nestimates from better to worse than current   \nexpectations. Scenarios are weighted based on \nthe Company\u2019s expectation of economic         \nconditions for the foreseeable future and     \nreflect significant judgment and consideration\nof uncertainties that exist. Final loss       \nestimates also consider factors affecting     \ncredit losses not reflected in the scenarios, \ndue to the unique aspects of current          \nconditions and expectations. These factors may\ninclude, but are not limited to, loan         \nservicing practices, regulatory guidance,     \nand/or fiscal and monetary policy actions.    \nBecause business processes and credit risks   \nassociated with unfunded credit commitments   \nare essentially the same as for loans, the    \nCompany utilizes similar processes to estimate\nits liability for unfunded credit commitments,\nwhich is included in other liabilities in the \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Both the allowance\nfor loan losses and the liability for unfunded\ncredit commitments are included in the        \nCompany\u2019s analysis of credit losses and       \nreported reserve ratios. The allowance        \nrecorded for credit losses utilizes forward-  \nlooking expected loss models to consider a    \nvariety of factors affecting lifetime credit  \nlosses. These factors include, but are not    \nlimited to, macroeconomic variables such as   \nunemployment rates, real estate prices, gross \ndomestic product levels and corporate bonds   \nspreads, as well as loan and borrower         \ncharacteristics, such as internal risk ratings\non commercial loans and consumer credit       \nscores, delinquency status, collateral        \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    19  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \ntype and available valuation information,     \nconsideration of end-of-termlosses on lease   \nresiduals, and the remaining term of the loan,\nadjusted for expected prepayments. For each   \nloan portfolio, model estimates are adjusted  \nas necessary to consider any relevant changes \nin portfolio composition, lending policies,   \nunderwriting standards, risk management       \npractices, economic conditions or other       \nfactors that may affect the accuracy of the   \nmodel. Expected credit loss estimates also    \ninclude consideration of expected cash        \nrecoveries on loans previously charged-offor  \nexpected recoveries on collateral-dependent   \nloans where recovery is expected through sale \nof the collateral. Where loans do not exhibit \nsimilar risk characteristics, an individual   \nanalysis is performed to consider expected    \ncredit losses. The allowance recorded for     \nindividually evaluated loans greater than $5  \nmillion in the commercial lending segment is  \nbased on an analysis utilizing expected cash  \nflows discounted using the original effective \ninterest rate, the observable market price of \nthe loan, or the fair value of the collateral,\nless selling costs, for collateral-dependent  \nloans as appropriate. For commercial TDRs     \nindividually evaluated for impairment,        \nattributes of the borrower are the primary    \nfactors in determining the allowance for      \ncredit losses. However, historical loss       \nexperience is also incorporated into the      \nallowance methodology applied to this category\nof loans. Commercial lending segment TDR loans\nmay be collectively evaluated for impairment  \nwhere observed performance history, including \ndefaults, is a primary driver of the loss     \nallocation. The allowance recorded for TDR    \nloans in the consumer lending segment is      \ndetermined on a homogenous pool basis         \nutilizing expected cash flows discounted using\nthe original effective interest rate of the   \npool. The expected cash flows on TDR loans    \nconsider subsequent payment defaults since    \nmodification, the borrower\u2019s ability to pay   \nunder the restructured terms, and the timing  \nand amount of payments. The allowance for     \ncollateral-dependent loans in the consumer    \nlending segment is determined based on the    \ncurrent fair value of the collateral less     \ncosts to sell. When evaluating the            \nappropriateness of the allowance for credit   \nlosses for any loans and lines in a junior    \nlien position, the Company considers the      \ndelinquency and modification status of the    \nfirst lien. At September 30, 2021, the Company\nserviced the first lien on 36 percent of the  \nhome equity loans and lines in a junior lien  \nposition. The Company also considers the      \nstatus of first lien mortgage accounts        \nreported on customer credit bureau files when \nthe first lien is not serviced by the Company.\nRegardless of whether the Company services the\nfirst lien, an assessment is made of economic \nconditions, problem loans, recent loss        \nexperience and other factors in determining   \nthe allowance for credit losses. Based on the \navailable information, the Company estimated  \n$247 million or 2.3 percent of its total home \nequity portfolio at September 30, 2021,       \nrepresented non-delinquentjunior liens where  \nthe first lien was delinquent or modified,    \nexcluding loans in COVID-related forbearance  \nprograms. The Company considers historical    \nloss experience on the loans and lines in a   \njunior lien position to establish loss        \nestimates for junior lien loans and lines the \nCompany services that are current, but the    \nfirst lien is delinquent or modified. The     \nhistorical long-term average loss experience  \nrelated to junior liens has been relatively   \nlimited (less than 1 percent of the total     \nportfolio annually), and estimates are        \nadjusted to consider current collateral       \nsupport and portfolio risk characteristics.   \nThese include updated credit scores and       \ncollateral estimates obtained on the Company\u2019s\nhome equity portfolio each quarter. In its    \nevaluation of the allowance for credit losses,\nthe Company also considers the increased risk \nof loss associated with home equity lines that\nare contractually scheduled to convert from a \nrevolving status to a fully amortizing        \npayment. Beginning January 1, 2020, when a    \nloan portfolio is purchased, the acquired     \nloans are divided into those considered       \npurchased with more than insignificant credit \ndeterioration (\u201cPCD\u201d) and those not considered\npurchased with more than insignificant credit \ndeterioration. An allowance is established for\neach population and considers product mix,    \nrisk characteristics of the portfolio,        \nbankruptcy experience, delinquency status and \nrefreshed LTV ratios when possible. The       \nallowance established for purchased loans not \nconsidered PCD is recognized through provision\nexpense upon acquisition, whereas the         \nallowance established for loans considered PCD\nat acquisition is offset by an increase in the\nbasis of the acquired loans. Any subsequent   \nincreases and decreases in the allowance      \nrelated to purchased loans, regardless of PCD \nstatus, are recognized through provision      \nexpense, with charge-offs charged to the      \nallowance. The Company did not have a material\namount of PCD loans included in its loan      \nportfolio at September 30, 2021. The Company\u2019s\nmethodology for determining the appropriate   \nallowance for credit losses also considers the\nimprecision inherent in the methodologies used\nand allocated to the various loan portfolios. \nAs a result, amounts determined under the     \nmethodologies described above are adjusted by \nmanagement to consider the potential impact of\nother qualitative factors not captured in     \nquantitative model adjustments which include, \nbut are not limited to, the following: model  \nimprecision,                                  \n                      \n  20    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nimprecision in economic scenario assumptions, \nand emerging risks related to either changes  \nin the economic environment that are affecting\nspecific portfolios, or changes in portfolio  \nconcentrations over time that may affect model\nperformance. The consideration of these items \nresults in adjustments to allowance amounts   \nincluded in the Company\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses for each loan portfolio. Although the  \nCompany determined the amount of each element \nof the allowance separately and considers this\nprocess to be an important credit management  \ntool, the entire allowance for credit losses  \nis available for the entire loan portfolio.   \nThe actual amount of losses can vary          \nsignificantly from the estimated amounts. At  \nSeptember 30, 2021, the allowance for credit  \nlosses was $6.3 billion (2.12 percent of      \nperiod-endloans), compared with an allowance  \nof $8.0 billion (2.69 percent of period-      \nendloans) at December 31, 2020. The ratio of  \nthe allowance for credit losses to            \nnonperforming loans was 695 percent at        \nSeptember 30, 2021, compared with 654 percent \nat December 31, 2020. The ratio of the        \nallowance for credit losses to annualized loan\nnet charge-offs was 1,080 percent at September\n30, 2021, compared with 448 percent of full   \nyear 2020 net charge-offs at December 31,     \n2020. The decrease in the allowance for credit\nlosses of $1.7 billion (21.3 percent) at      \nSeptember 30, 2021, compared with December 31,\n2020, reflected factors affecting economic    \nconditions during the first nine months of    \n2021, including the enactment of additional   \nbenefits from government stimulus programs and\nbroad vaccine availability in the United      \nStates that has reduced the risks associated  \nwith COVID-19,contributing to an economic     \nrecovery. However, economic uncertainty       \nremains associated with rising inflationary   \nconcerns, additional virus variants and lack  \nof a clear path to government funding. In     \naddition to these factors, expected loss      \nestimates consider various factors including  \ncustomer specific information impacting       \nchanges in risk ratings, projected            \ndelinquencies and potential effects of        \ndiminishing liquidity without support of      \nmortgage forbearance and direct federal       \nstimulus. Currently, consumer credit trends   \ncontinue to perform better than expected,     \nwhile select commercial portfolios most       \nimpacted by COVID-19continue to be monitored  \nfor structural shifts associated with the     \npandemic. Changes in economic conditions      \nduring the first nine months of 2021 included \nimprovements in projected gross domestic      \nproduct and unemployment levels for 2021,     \nwhich reflected the additional government     \nstimulus and availability of vaccines. These  \nfactors are evaluated through a combination of\nquantitative calculations using economic      \nscenarios and qualitative assessments that    \nconsider the high degree of uncertainty       \nrelated to the unprecedented levels of both   \neconomic stress and the stimulus response.

Changes\nin the allowance for credit losses are based  \non a variety of factors, including loan       \nbalance changes, portfolio credit quality and \nmix changes, and changes in general economic  \nconditions and expectations (including for    \nunemployment and gross domestic product),     \namong other factors. Based on economic        \nconditions at September 30, 2021, it was      \ndifficult to estimate the length and severity \nof the longer term effects on certain industry\nsectors that may result from COVID-19and the  \nimpact of other factors that may influence the\nlevel of eventual losses and corresponding    \nrequirements for the allowance for credit     \nlosses, including the impact of inflationary  \npressures on certain lending sectors and      \ndiminishing liquidity after economic stimulus \nprograms and accommodations delaying mortgage \nand rent payments end. While reserves consider\nthe uncertainty in these estimates, the       \nunpredictability of the COVID-19pandemic could\nresult in the recognition of credit losses in \nthe Company\u2019s loan portfolios and increases in\nthe allowance for credit losses. Scenarios    \nworse than the Company\u2019s expected outcome at  \nSeptember 30, 2021 include risks that         \ngovernment stimulus in response to the        \nCOVID-19pandemic is less effective than       \nexpected, or that a longer or more severe     \nhealth crisis prolongs the downturn in        \neconomic activity, potentially reducing the   \nnumber of businesses that are ultimately able \nto resume operations after the crisis has     \npassed. Other factors considered include      \nconcerns around inflationary pressures, new   \nvirus variants, sustainability of asset values\nand borrower liquidity, along with the lack of\na clear path to government funding. The       \nallowance for credit losses related to        \ncommercial lending segment loans decreased    \n$926 million during the first nine months of  \n2021, due to improvements in general economic \nconditions and portfolio credit quality that  \nincluded some return of economic activity in  \ncertain industry sectors affected by COVID-19.\nThe following table summarizes the

    \nvaluation reviews and monitoring of residual  \nvalue gains or losses upon the disposition of \nassets. As of September 30, 2021, no          \nsignificant change in the amount of residual  \nvalues or concentration of the portfolios had \noccurred since December 31, 2020.

Operational risk is   \ninherent in all business activities, and the  \nmanagement of this risk is important to the   \nachievement of the Company\u2019s objectives.      \nBusiness lines have direct and primary        \nresponsibility and accountability for         \nidentifying, controlling, and monitoring      \noperational risks embedded in their business  \nactivities, including those additional or     \nincreased risks created by the economic and   \nfinancial disruptions, and the Company\u2019s      \nalternative working arrangements resulting    \nfrom the COVID-19pandemic. The Company        \nmaintains a system of controls with the       \nobjective of providing proper transaction     \nauthorization and execution, proper system    \noperations, proper oversight of third parties \nwith whom it does business, safeguarding of   \nassets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the \nreliability and security of financial and     \nother data.

Interest Rate Risk Management In  \nthe banking industry, changes in interest     \nrates are a significant risk that can impact  \nearnings and the safety and soundness of an   \nentity. The Company manages its exposure to   \nchanges in interest rates through asset and   \nliability management activities within        \nguidelines established by its Asset Liability \nManagement Committee (\u201cALCO\u201d) and approved by \nthe Board of Directors. The ALCO has the      \nresponsibility for approving and ensuring     \ncompliance with the ALCO management policies, \nincluding interest rate risk exposure. One way\nthe Company measures and analyzes its interest\nrate risk is through net interest income      \nsimulation analysis. Simulation analysis      \nincorporates substantially all of the         \nCompany\u2019s assets and liabilities and off-     \nbalancesheet instruments, together with       \nforecasted changes in the balance sheet and   \nassumptions that reflect the current interest \nrate environment. Through this simulation,    \nmanagement estimates the impact on net        \ninterest income of various interest rate      \nchanges that differ in the direction, amount  \nand speed of change over time, as well as the \nshape of the yield curve. This simulation     \nincludes assumptions about how the balance    \nsheet is likely to be affected by changes in  \nloan and deposit growth. Assumptions are made \nto project interest rates for new loans and   \ndeposits based on historical analysis,        \nmanagement\u2019s outlook and re-pricingstrategies.\nThese assumptions are reviewed and validated  \non a periodic basis with sensitivity analysis \nbeing provided for key variables of the       \nsimulation. The results are reviewed monthly  \nby the ALCO and are used to guide             \nasset/liability management strategies. The    \nCompany manages its interest rate risk        \nposition by holding assets with desired       \ninterest rate risk characteristics on its     \nbalance sheet, implementing certain pricing   \nstrategies for loans and deposits and         \nselecting derivatives and various funding and \ninvestment portfolio strategies. Table 9      \nsummarizes the projected impact to net        \ninterest income over the next 12 months of    \nvarious potential interest rate changes. The  \nsensitivity of the projected impact to net    \ninterest income over the next 12 months is    \ndependent on balance sheet growth, product    \nmix, deposit behavior, pricing and funding    \ndecisions. While the Company utilizes models  \nand assumptions based on historical           \ninformation and expected behaviors, actual    \noutcomes could vary significantly.            \n                      \n  24    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table\u00a09    Sensitivity of Net Interest      \n             Income                           \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  *  Given the level of interest rates,       \n     downward rate scenario is not computed.  \n                                              \nUse of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and\nOther Risks To manage the sensitivity of      \nearnings and capital to interest rate,        \nprepayment, credit, price and foreign currency\nfluctuations (asset and liability management  \npositions), the Company enters into derivative\ntransactions. The Company uses derivatives for\nasset and liability management purposes       \nprimarily in the following ways:              \n                                              \n       To convert fixed-rate debt             \n  \u2022    andavailable-for-saleinvestment        \n       securities from fixed-rate payments    \n       to floating-rate payments;             \n                                              \n                                              \n       To convert floating-rate debt from     \n  \u2022    floating-rate payments to fixed-rate   \n       payments;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate changes in value of the    \n  \u2022    Company\u2019s unfunded mortgage loan       \n       commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs;    \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate remeasurement volatility   \n  \u2022    of foreign currency denominated        \n       balances; and                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate the volatility of the      \n  \u2022    Company\u2019s net investment in foreign    \n       operations driven by fluctuations in   \n       foreign currency exchange rates.       \n                                              \nIn addition, the Company enters into interest \nrate and foreign exchange derivative contracts\nto support the business requirements of its   \ncustomers (customer-related positions). The   \nCompany minimizes the market and liquidity    \nrisks of customer-related positions by either \nentering into similar offsetting positions    \nwith broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis  \nby entering into other derivative or non-     \nderivativefinancial instruments that partially\nor fully offset the exposure from these       \ncustomer-related positions. The Company may   \nenter into derivative contracts that are      \neither exchange-traded, centrally cleared     \nthrough clearinghouses or over-the-counter.The\nCompany does not utilize derivatives for      \nspeculative purposes. The Company does not    \ndesignate all of the derivatives that it      \nenters into for risk management purposes as   \naccounting hedges because of the inefficiency \nof applying the accounting requirements and   \nmay instead elect fair value accounting for   \nthe related hedged items. In particular, the  \nCompany enters into interest rate swaps,      \nswaptions, forward commitments to buy to-be-  \nannouncedsecurities (\u201cTBAs\u201d), U.S. Treasury   \nand Eurodollar futures and options on U.S.    \nTreasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in  \nthe value of its MSRs, but does not designate \nthose derivatives as accounting hedges.       \nAdditionally, the Company uses forward        \ncommitments to sell TBAs and other commitments\nto sell residential mortgage loans at         \nspecified prices to economically hedge the    \ninterest rate risk in its residential mortgage\nloan production activities. At September 30,  \n2021, the Company had $10.7 billion of forward\ncommitments to sell, hedging $5.0 billion of  \nMLHFS and $8.6 billion of unfunded mortgage   \nloan commitments. The forward commitments to  \nsell and the unfunded mortgage loan           \ncommitments on loans intended to be sold are  \nconsidered derivatives under the accounting   \nguidance related to accounting for derivative \ninstruments and hedging activities. The       \nCompany has elected the fair value option for \nthe MLHFS. Derivatives are subject to credit  \nrisk associated with counterparties to the    \ncontracts. Credit risk associated with        \nderivatives is measured by the Company based  \non the probability of counterparty default,   \nincluding consideration of the                \nCOVID-19pandemic. The Company manages the     \ncredit risk of its derivative positions by    \ndiversifying its positions among various      \ncounterparties, by entering into master       \nnetting arrangements, and, where possible, by \nrequiring collateral arrangements. The Company\nmay also transfer counterparty credit risk    \nrelated to interest rate swaps to third       \nparties through the use of risk participation \nagreements. In addition, certain interest rate\nswaps, interest rate forwards and credit      \ncontracts are required to be centrally cleared\nthrough clearinghouses to further mitigate    \ncounterparty credit risk. For additional      \ninformation on derivatives and hedging        \nactivities, refer to Notes 13 and 14 in the   \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   \nLIBOR Transition In July 2017, the United     \nKingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the    \n\u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it would no longer      \nrequire banks to submit rates for the London  \nInterBank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) after 2021.  \nIn March 2021, the FCA and the administrator  \nof LIBOR announced that LIBOR will no longer  \nbe published on a representative basis after  \nDecember 31, 2021, except for the most        \ncommonly used tenors of United States Dollar  \nLIBOR which will no longer be published on a  \nrepresentative basis after June 30, 2023. The \nCompany holds financial instruments that will \nbe impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR,   \nincluding                                     \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    25  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \ncertain loans, investment securities,         \nderivatives, borrowings and other financial   \ninstruments that use LIBOR as the benchmark   \nrate. The Company also provides various       \nservices to customers in its capacities as    \ntrustee and servicer, which involve financial \ninstruments that will be similarly impacted by\nthe discontinuance of LIBOR. The Company      \nanticipates these financial instruments will  \nrequire transition to a new reference rate.   \nThis transition will occur over time as many  \nof these arrangements do not have an          \nalternative rate referenced in their contracts\nor a clear path for the parties to agree upon \nan alternative reference rate. In order to    \nfacilitate the transition process, the Company\nhas instituted a LIBOR Transition Office and  \ncommenced an enterprise-wide project to       \nidentify, assess, monitor and mitigate risks  \nassociated with the expected discontinuance or\nunavailability of LIBOR, actively engage with \nindustry working groups and regulators,       \nachieve operational readiness for the use of  \nalternative reference rates and engage        \nimpacted customers to remediate and transition\nimpacted instruments. The Company has invested\nin its systems, models, procedures and        \ninternal infrastructure to accept alternative \nreference rates to LIBOR and has begun        \noffering these alternatives to clients. The   \nCompany also adopted industry best practice   \nguidelines for fallback language for new      \ntransactions, converted its cleared interest  \nrate swaps discounting to Secured Overnight   \nFinancing Rate discounting, and distributed   \ncommunications related to the transition to   \ncertain impacted parties, both inside and     \noutside the Company. Refer to \u201cRisk Factors\u201d  \nin the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor\nthe year ended December 31, 2020, for further \ndiscussion on potential risks that could      \nadversely affect the Company\u2019s financial      \nresults as a result of the LIBOR transition.  \nMarket Risk Management In addition to interest\nrate risk, the Company is exposed to other    \nforms of market risk, principally related to  \ntrading activities which support customers\u2019   \nstrategies to manage their own foreign        \ncurrency, interest rate risk and funding      \nactivities. For purposes of its internal      \ncapital adequacy assessment process, the      \nCompany considers risk arising from its       \ntrading activities, as well as the            \nremeasurement volatility of foreign currency  \ndenominated balances included on its          \nConsolidated Balance Sheet (collectively,     \n\u201cCovered Positions\u201d), employing methodologies \nconsistent with the requirements of regulatory\nrules for market risk. The Company\u2019s Market   \nRisk Committee (\u201cMRC\u201d), within the framework  \nof the ALCO, oversees market risk management. \nThe MRC monitors and reviews the Company\u2019s    \nCovered Positions and establishes policies for\nmarket risk management, including exposure    \nlimits for each portfolio. The Company uses a \nVaR approach to measure general market risk.  \nTheoretically, VaR represents the statistical \nrisk of loss the Company has to adverse market\nmovements over a one-daytime horizon. The     \nCompany uses the Historical Simulation method \nto calculate VaR for its Covered Positions    \nmeasured at the ninety-ninth percentile using \na one-yearlook-back period for distributions  \nderived from past market data. The market     \nfactors used in the calculations include those\npertinent to market risks inherent in the     \nunderlying trading portfolios, principally    \nthose that affect the Company\u2019s corporate bond\ntrading business, foreign currency transaction\nbusiness, client derivatives business, loan   \ntrading business and municipal securities     \nbusiness, as well as those inherent in the    \nCompany\u2019s foreign denominated balances and the\nderivatives used to mitigate the related      \nmeasurement volatility. On average, the       \nCompany expects the one-dayVaR to be exceeded \nby actual losses two to three times per year  \nrelated to these positions. The Company       \nmonitors the accuracy of internal VaR models  \nand modeling processes by back-testing model  \nperformance, regularly updating the historical\ndata used by the VaR models and regular model \nvalidations to assess the accuracy of the     \nmodels\u2019 input, processing, and reporting      \ncomponents.

The Company engages in various  \nactivities to manage its liquidity risk. These\nactivities include diversifying its funding   \nsources, stress testing, and holding readily- \nmarketable assets which can be used as a      \nsource of liquidity if needed. In addition,   \nthe Company\u2019s profitable operations, sound    \ncredit quality and strong capital position    \nhave enabled it to develop a large and        \nreliable base of core deposit funding within  \nits market areas and in domestic and global   \ncapital markets. The Company\u2019s Board of       \nDirectors approves the Company\u2019s liquidity    \npolicy. The Risk Management Committee of the  \nCompany\u2019s Board of Directors oversees the     \nCompany\u2019s liquidity risk management process   \nand approves a contingency funding plan. The  \nALCO reviews the Company\u2019s liquidity policy   \nand limits, and regularly assesses the        \nCompany\u2019s ability to meet funding requirements\narising from adverse company-specific or      \nmarket events. The Company regularly projects \nits funding needs under various stress        \nscenarios and maintains a contingency funding \nplan consistent with the Company\u2019s access to  \ndiversified sources of contingent funding. The\nCompany maintains a substantial level of total\navailable liquidity in the form of on-        \nbalancesheet and off-balancesheet funding     \nsources. These liquidity sources include cash \nat the Federal Reserve Bank and certain       \nEuropean central banks, unencumbered liquid   \nassets, and capacity to borrow from the FHLB  \nand at Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s Discount Window.\nAt September 30, 2021, the fair value of      \nunencumbered investment securities totaled    \n$117.6 billion, compared with $125.9 billion  \nat December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 4 of the  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements and\n\u201cBalance Sheet Analysis\u201d for further          \ninformation on investment securities          \nmaturities and trends. Asset liquidity is     \nfurther enhanced by the Company\u2019s practice of \npledging loans to access secured borrowing    \nfacilities through the FHLB and Federal       \nReserve Bank. At September 30, 2021, the      \nCompany could have borrowed a total of an     \nadditional $97.4 billion from the FHLB and    \nFederal Reserve Bank based on collateral      \navailable for additional borrowings. The      \nCompany\u2019s diversified deposit base provides a \nsizeable source of relatively stable and low- \ncostfunding, while reducing the Company\u2019s     \nreliance on the wholesale markets. Total      \ndeposits were $442.9 billion at September 30, \n2021, compared with $429.8 billion at December\n31, 2020. Refer to \u201cBalance Sheet Analysis\u201d   \nfor further information on the Company\u2019s      \ndeposits. Additional funding is provided by   \nlong-term debt and short-term borrowings.     \nLong-term debt was $35.7 billion at September \n30, 2021, and is an important funding source  \nbecause of its multi-year borrowing structure.\nShort-term borrowings were $16.1 billion at   \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    27  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nSeptember 30, 2021, and supplement the        \nCompany\u2019s other funding sources. Refer to     \n\u201cBalance Sheet Analysis\u201d for further          \ninformation on the Company\u2019s long-term debt   \nand short-term borrowings. In addition to     \nassessing liquidity risk on a consolidated    \nbasis, the Company monitors the parent        \ncompany\u2019s liquidity. The Company establishes  \nlimits for the minimal number of months into  \nthe future where the parent company can meet  \nexisting and forecasted obligations with cash \nand securities held that can be readily       \nmonetized. The Company measures and manages   \nthis limit in both normal and adverse         \nconditions. The Company maintains sufficient  \nfunding to meet expected capital and debt     \nservice obligations for 24 months without the \nsupport of dividends from subsidiaries and    \nassuming access to the wholesale markets is   \nmaintained. The Company maintains sufficient  \nliquidity to meet its capital and debt service\nobligations for 12 months under adverse       \nconditions without the support of dividends   \nfrom subsidiaries or access to the wholesale  \nmarkets. The parent company is currently well \nin excess of required liquidity minimums. At  \nSeptember 30, 2021, parent company long-term  \ndebt outstanding was $19.2 billion, compared  \nwith $20.9 billion at December 31, 2020. The  \ndecrease was primarily due to $1.5 billion of \nmedium-term note repayments. As of September  \n30, 2021, there was no parent company debt    \nscheduled to mature in the remainder of 2021. \nThe Company is subject to a regulatory        \nLiquidity Coverage Ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d) requirement  \nwhich requires banks to maintain an adequate  \nlevel of unencumbered high quality liquid     \nassets to meet estimated liquidity needs over \na 30-daystressed period. At September 30,     \n2021, the Company was compliant with this     \nrequirement. Beginning July 1, 2021, the      \nCompany is also subject to a regulatory Net   \nStable Funding Ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) requirement     \nwhich requires banks to maintain a minimum    \nlevel of stable funding based on the liquidity\ncharacteristics of their assets, commitments, \nand derivative exposures over a one-yeartime  \nhorizon. At September 30, 2021, the Company   \nwas compliant with this requirement. Refer to \n\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \u2014       \nLiquidity Risk Management\u201d in the Company\u2019s   \nAnnual Report on Form 10-Kfor the year ended  \nDecember 31, 2020, for further discussion on  \nliquidity risk management. European Exposures \nThe Company provides merchant processing and  \ncorporate trust services in Europe either     \ndirectly or through banking affiliations in   \nEurope. Revenue generated from sources in     \nEurope represented approximately 2 percent of \nthe Company\u2019s total net revenue for both the  \nthree and nine months ended September 30,     \n2021. Operating cash for these businesses is  \ndeposited on a short-term basis typically with\ncertain European central banks. For deposits  \nplaced at other European banks, exposure is   \nmitigated by the Company placing deposits at  \nmultiple banks and managing the amounts on    \ndeposit at any bank based on institution-     \nspecific deposit limits. At September 30,     \n2021, the Company had an aggregate amount on  \ndeposit with European banks of approximately  \n$10.1 billion, predominately with the Central \nBank of Ireland and Bank of England. In       \naddition, the Company provides financing to   \ndomestic multinational corporations that      \ngenerate revenue from customers in European   \ncountries, transacts with various European    \nbanks as counterparties to certain derivative-\nrelated activities, and through a subsidiary, \nmanages money market funds that hold certain  \ninvestments in European sovereign debt. Any   \nfurther deterioration in economic conditions  \nin Europe, including the potential negative   \nimpact of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from\nthe European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d), is not expected\nto have a significant effect on the Company   \nrelated to these activities. The Company is   \nfocused on providing continuity of services,  \nwith minimal disruption resulting from Brexit,\nto customers with activities in European      \ncountries. The Company has made certain       \nstructural changes to its legal entities and  \noperations in the United Kingdom and European \nUnion, where needed, and migrated certain     \nbusiness activities to the appropriate        \njurisdictions to continue to provide such     \nservices and generate revenue. Off-           \nBalanceSheet Arrangements Off-balancesheet    \narrangements include any contractual          \narrangements to which an unconsolidated entity\nis a party, under which the Company has an    \nobligation to provide credit or liquidity     \nenhancements or market risk support.

The Company also manages \nits capital to exceed regulatory capital      \nrequirements for banking organizations. The   \nregulatory capital requirements effective for \nthe Company follow Basel III, with the Company\nbeing subject to calculating its capital      \nadequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted     \nassets under the standardized approach.       \nBeginning in 2020, the Company elected to     \nadopt a rule issued in 2020 by its regulators \nwhich permits banking organizations who adopt \naccounting guidance related to the impairment \nof financial instruments based on the current \nexpected credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d) methodology   \nduring 2020, the option to defer the impact of\nthe effect of that guidance at adoption plus  \n25 percent of its quarterly credit reserve    \nincreases over the next two years on its      \nregulatory capital requirements, followed by a\nthree-year transition period to phase in the  \ncumulative deferred impact. Table 10 provides \na summary of statutory regulatory capital     \nratios in effect for the Company at September \n30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. All regulatory\nratios exceeded regulatory \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d \nrequirements. The Company believes certain    \nother capital ratios are useful in evaluating \nits capital adequacy. The Company\u2019s tangible  \ncommon equity, as a percent of tangible assets\nand as a percent of risk-weighted assets      \ndetermined in accordance with transitional    \nregulatory capital requirements related to the\nCECL methodology under the standardized       \napproach, was 6.8 percent and 9.4 percent,    \nrespectively, at September 30, 2021, compared \nwith 6.9 percent and 9.5 percent,             \nrespectively, at December 31, 2020. In        \naddition, the Company\u2019s common equity tier 1  \ncapital to risk-weighted assets ratio,        \nreflecting the full implementation of the CECL\nmethodology was 9.7 percent at September 30,  \n2021, compared with 9.3 percent at December   \n31, 2020. Refer to \u201cNon-GAAPFinancial         \nMeasures\u201d beginning on page 35 for further    \ninformation on these other capital ratios.    \nTotal U.S. Bancorp shareholders\u2019 equity was   \n$53.7 billion at September 30, 2021, compared \nwith $53.1 billion at December 31, 2020. The  \nincrease was primarily the result of corporate\nearnings, partially offset by changes in      \nunrealized gains and losses on available-for- \nsaleinvestment securities included in other   \ncomprehensive income (loss), dividends and    \ncommon share repurchases. Beginning in March  \nof 2020 and continuing through the remainder  \nof 2020, the Company suspended all common     \nstock repurchases except for those done       \nexclusively in connection with its stock-based\ncompensation programs. This action was        \ninitially taken to maintain strong capital    \nlevels given the impact and uncertainties of  \nCOVID-19on the economy and global markets. Due\nto continued economic uncertainty, the Federal\nReserve Board implemented measures beginning  \nin the third quarter of 2020 and extending    \nthrough the second quarter of 2021,           \nrestricting capital distributions of all large\nbank holding companies, including the Company.\nThese restrictions limited the aggregate      \namount of common stock dividends and share    \nrepurchases to an amount that did not exceed  \nthe average net income of the four preceding  \ncalendar quarters. Based on the results of the\nDecember 2020 Federal Reserve Board Stress    \nTest, the Company announced on December 22,   \n2020 that its Board of Directors had approved \nan authorization to repurchase up to $3.0     \nbillion of its common stock beginning January \n1, 2021, and repurchased $1.5 billion of its  \ncommon stock during the first six months of   \n2021 under this program. The Company suspended\nall common stock repurchases at the beginning \nof the third quarter of 2021, except for those\ndone exclusively in connection with its stock-\nbased compensation programs, due to its       \nrecently announced acquisition of MUFG Union  \nBank\u2019s core regional banking franchise. The   \nCompany does not expect to commence           \nrepurchasing its common stock again until the \nsecond half of 2022, or after the acquisition \ncloses in order to build capital prior to the \nacquisition.                                  \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    29  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe following table provides a detailed       \nanalysis of all shares purchased by the       \nCompany or any affiliated purchaser during the\nthird quarter of 2021:                        \n                                              \n                              Tot\u2026            \n                              Num\u2026       Ap\u2026  \n                                of       Do\u2026  \n                              Sha\u2026        of  \n                              Pur\u2026       Sh\u2026  \n                                as       May  \n                              Part       Yet  \n        Tot\u2026           Av\u2026      of       Be\u2026  \n        Num\u2026           Pr\u2026    Pub\u2026       Un\u2026  \n          of           Pa\u2026    Ann\u2026       Pr\u2026  \n        Sha\u2026           Per    Pro\u2026       (In  \n  P\u2026    Pur\u2026           Sh\u2026     (a)       Mi\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  J\u2026    80,\u2026  -b    $  58\u2026    5,2\u2026    $  1,\u2026  \n  A\u2026     368           55\u2026     368       1,\u2026  \n  S\u2026     428           55\u2026     428       1,\u2026  \n  T\u2026    81,\u2026  -b    $  58\u2026    6,0\u2026    $  1,\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n       All shares were purchased under the    \n  (a)  $3.0\u00a0billion common stock repurchase   \n       authorization program announced        \n       December\u00a022, 2020.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Includes 75,000 shares of common       \n       stock purchased, at an average price   \n       per share of $58.15, in open-market    \n       transactions by U.S. Bank National     \n  (b)  Association, the Company\u2019s banking     \n       subsidiary, in its capacity as         \n       trustee of the U.S. Bank 401(k)        \n       Savings Plan, which is the Company\u2019s   \n       employee retirement savings plan.      \n                                              \nBased on the results of the 2021 Federal      \nReserve Board Annual Stress Test, the Company \nannounced on September 14, 2021 that its Board\nof Directors had approved a regular quarterly \ndividend of $0.46 per common share, payable in\nOctober 2021.

LINE OF     \nBUSINESS FINANCIAL REVIEW The Company\u2019s major \nlines of business are Corporate and Commercial\nBanking, Consumer and Business Banking, Wealth\nManagement and Investment Services, Payment   \nServices, and Treasury and Corporate Support. \nThese operating segments are components of the\nCompany about which financial information is  \nprepared and is evaluated regularly by        \nmanagement in deciding how to allocate        \nresources and assess performance. Basis for   \nFinancial Presentation Business line results  \nare derived from the Company\u2019s business unit  \nprofitability reporting systems by            \nspecifically attributing managed balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and    \ntheir related income or expense. Refer to Note\n17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial     \nStatements for further information on the     \nbusiness lines\u2019 basis for financial           \npresentation. Designations, assignments and   \nallocations change from time to time as       \nmanagement systems are enhanced, methods of   \nevaluating performance or product lines change\nor business segments are realigned to better  \nrespond to the Company\u2019s diverse customer     \nbase. During 2021, certain organization and   \nmethodology changes were made and,            \naccordingly, 2020 results were restated and   \npresented on a comparable basis. Corporate and\nCommercial Banking Corporate and Commercial   \nBanking offers lending, equipment finance and \nsmall-ticket leasing, depository services,    \ntreasury management, capital markets services,\ninternational trade services and other        \nfinancial services to middle market, large    \ncorporate, commercial real estate, financial  \ninstitution, non-profitand public sector      \nclients. Corporate and Commercial Banking     \ncontributed $403 million of the Company\u2019s net \nincome in the third quarter and $1.3 billion  \nin the first nine months of 2021, or a        \ndecrease of $44 million (9.8 percent) and an  \nincrease of $61 million (5.0 percent),        \nrespectively, compared with the same periods  \nof 2020. Net revenue decreased $149 million   \n(13.3 percent) in the third quarter and $564  \nmillion (16.0 percent) in the first nine      \nmonths of 2021, compared with the same periods\nof 2020. Net interest income, on a taxable-   \nequivalent basis, decreased $135 million (15.8\npercent) in the third quarter and $451 million\n(17.2 percent) in the first nine months of    \n2021, compared with the same periods of 2020. \nThe decreases were primarily due to lower     \naverage loan and deposit balances as well as  \nthe impact of declining interest rates on the \nmargin benefit from deposits, partially offset\nby favorable deposit mix with higher          \nnoninterest-bearing deposit balances and      \nslightly higher loan spreads. Average loan    \nbalances declined as significant liquidity    \ndraws during the early stages of the pandemic \nwere paid down in the second half of 2020 and \nthe first quarter of 2021. Noninterest income \ndecreased $14 million (5.2 percent) in the    \nthird quarter and $113 million (12.6 percent) \nin the first nine months of 2021, compared    \nwith the same periods of 2020, primarily      \ndriven by lower capital markets activities and\ntrading revenue, partially offset by continued\nstronger treasury management fees due to core \ngrowth driven by the economic recovery.       \nNoninterest expense decreased $10 million (2.3\npercent) in the third quarter and $53 million \n(4.0 percent) in the first nine months of     \n2021, compared with the same periods of 2020, \nprimarily due to lower FDIC insurance expense,\nlower production incentives, and higher       \ncapitalized loan costs, partially offset by an\nincrease in net shared services expense driven\nby investment in infrastructure and technology\ndevelopment.                                  \n                      \n  30    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe provision for credit losses decreased $80 \nmillion (84.2 percent) in the third quarter   \nand $592 million in the first nine months of  \n2021, compared with the same periods of 2020, \nprimarily due to a decrease in the reserve    \nallocation driven by improving portfolio      \ncredit quality in the current year, compared  \nwith deteriorating credit quality in the prior\nyear.

Net revenue decreased $56 million    \n(2.4 percent) in the third quarter and $151   \nmillion (2.3 percent) in the first nine months\nof 2021, compared with the same periods of    \n2020. Net interest income, on a taxable-      \nequivalent basis, increased $77 million (5.2  \npercent) in the third quarter and $364 million\n(8.6 percent) in the first nine months of     \n2021, compared with the same periods of 2020, \nreflecting continued strong growth in deposit \nbalances as well as favorable deposit mix,    \nfavorable loan spreads driven by growth in    \ninstallment loans, and higher loan fees driven\nby loan forgiveness related to the SBA\u2019s      \nPaycheck Protection Program. These increases  \nin net interest income were partially offset  \nby lower deposit spreads. Noninterest income  \ndecreased $133 million (15.7 percent) in the  \nthird quarter of 2021, compared with the third\nquarter of 2020, primarily due to lower       \nmortgage banking revenue reflecting lower     \nproduction volume and related gain on sale    \nmargins as refinancing activities declined,   \npartially offset by an increase in the fair   \nvalue of MSRs, net of hedging activities, as  \nwell as higher gains on GNMA loan sales.      \nPartially offsetting the decline in mortgage  \nbanking revenue, retail product fees were     \nstronger driven by retail leasing end of term \nresidual gains, and deposit service charges   \nincreased as a result of customer activity and\nhigher ATM processing revenue. Noninterest    \nincome decreased $515 million (21.2 percent)  \nin the first nine months of 2021, compared    \nwith the first nine months of 2020, primarily \ndue to lower mortgage banking revenue         \nreflecting lower production volume and related\ngain on sale margins, along with a reduction  \nin the fair value of MSRs, net of hedging     \nactivities, partially offset by higher gains  \non GNMA loan sales and higher retail product  \nfees. Noninterest expense increased $66       \nmillion (4.8 percent) in the third quarter and\n$146 million (3.6 percent) in the first nine  \nmonths of 2021, compared with the same periods\nof 2020, primarily due to increases in net    \nshared services expense due to investments in \ndigital capabilities and higher compensation  \nexpense related to merit increases, business  \nhiring related to mortgage forbearance loss   \nmitigation and revenue-related compensation   \ndriven by business production. The provision  \nfor credit losses decreased $94 million in the\nthird quarter and $412 million in the first   \nnine months of 2021, compared with the same   \nperiods of 2020, due to a decrease in the     \nreserve allocation primarily reflecting lower \ndelinquency rates in consumer portfolios and a\nreduction in end of period outstanding loan   \nbalances in the first nine months of 2021,    \ncompared with loan growth in the first nine   \nmonths of 2020.

\nreflecting higher compensation expense as a   \nresult of merit increases, higher performance-\nbased incentives related to investment sales  \nvolumes and core business growth, and an      \nincrease in net shared services expense,      \npartially offset by lower other noninterest   \nexpense due to the allocation to the business \nline of previously reserved legal matters in  \nthe third quarter of 2020. The provision for  \ncredit losses was flat in the third quarter of\n2021, compared with the third quarter of 2020,\nreflecting stable credit quality in the       \ncurrent quarter, compared with credit quality \ndeterioration in the third quarter of 2020,   \noffset by stronger balance growth in the      \ncurrent period compared with the third quarter\nof 2021. The provision for credit losses      \ndecreased $8 million (23.5 percent) in the    \nfirst nine months of 2021, compared with the  \nfirst nine months of 2020, reflecting a       \ndecrease in the reserve allocation in the     \nfirst quarter of 2021 driven by stable credit \nquality. Payment Services Payment Services    \nincludes consumer and business credit cards,  \nstored-value cards, debit cards, corporate,   \ngovernment and purchasing card services,      \nconsumer lines of credit and merchant         \nprocessing. Payment Services contributed $409 \nmillion of the Company\u2019s net income in the    \nthird quarter and $1.3 billion in the first   \nnine months of 2021, or increases of $87      \nmillion (27.0 percent) and $331 million (32.8 \npercent), respectively, compared with the same\nperiods of 2020. Net revenue increased $52    \nmillion (3.4 percent) in the third quarter and\n$256 million (6.1 percent) in the first nine  \nmonths of 2021, compared with the same periods\nof 2020. Net interest income, on a taxable-   \nequivalent basis, decreased $27 million (4.2  \npercent) in the third quarter and $69 million \n(3.6 percent) in the first nine months of     \n2021, compared with the same periods of 2020, \nprimarily due to loan mix and lower loan      \nbalances resulting from higher credit card    \npayment rates by customers. Net interest      \nincome further decreased in the third quarter \nof 2021, compared with the third quarter of   \n2020, due to slightly lower loan yields and   \nlower deposit balances driven by lower prepaid\ncard processing activities as government      \nstimulus dissipated. Noninterest income       \nincreased $79 million (9.1 percent) in the    \nthird quarter and $325 million (14.0 percent) \nin the first nine months of 2021, compared    \nwith the same periods of 2020, mainly due to  \ncontinued strengthening of consumer and       \nbusiness spending across most sectors driven  \nby government stimulus, local jurisdictions   \nreducing restrictions and consumer behaviors  \nnormalizing. As a result, there was strong    \ngrowth in merchant processing services revenue\ndriven by increased sales volume and higher   \nmerchant fees and equipment income, partially \noffset by higher rebates. There was also solid\ngrowth in corporate payment products revenue  \ndriven by improving business spending across  \nall product groups. Credit and debit card     \nrevenue increased, driven by higher net       \ninterchange revenue related to sales volume.  \nThe increase in credit and debit card revenue \nin the third quarter of 2021, compared with   \nthe third quarter of 2020, was mostly offset  \nby lower prepaid card processing activities as\ngovernment stimulus programs dissipated.      \nNoninterest expense increased $17 million (2.0\npercent) in the third quarter of 2021,        \ncompared with the third quarter of 2020,      \nreflecting the timing of marketing campaigns  \nand higher net shared services expense,       \npartially offset by higher incremental costs  \nrelated to the prepaid card business in the   \nthird quarter of 2020. Noninterest expense    \nincreased $77 million (3.2 percent) in the    \nfirst nine months of 2021, compared with the  \nfirst nine months of 2020, due to incremental \ncosts related to the prepaid card business in \nthe first six months of 2021 and lower        \nmarketing costs during 2020. The provision for\ncredit losses decreased $80 million (32.5     \npercent) in the third quarter and $261 million\n(54.7 percent) in the first nine months of    \n2021, compared with the same periods of 2020, \nprimarily driven by improved credit quality   \nrelative to the prior year. Treasury and      \nCorporate Support Treasury and Corporate      \nSupport includes the Company\u2019s investment     \nportfolios, funding, capital management,      \ninterest rate risk management, income taxes   \nnot allocated to the business lines, including\nmost investments in tax-advantagedprojects,   \nand the residual aggregate of those expenses  \nassociated with corporate activities that are \nmanaged on a consolidated basis. Treasury and \nCorporate Support recorded net income of $392 \nmillion in the third quarter and $1.2 billion \nin the first nine months of 2021, compared    \nwith net losses of $65 million and $1.3       \nbillion in the same periods of 2020,          \nrespectively. Net revenue increased $102      \nmillion (49.3 percent) in the third quarter   \nand $140 million (20.6 percent) in the first  \nnine months of 2021, compared with the same   \nperiods of 2020. Net interest income, on a    \ntaxable-equivalent basis, increased $106      \nmillion in the third quarter of 2021, compared\nwith the third quarter of 2020, primarily due \nto favorable funding and deposit mix and lower\npremium amortization within the investment    \nportfolio compared with the prior year. Net   \ninterest income, on a taxable-equivalent      \nbasis, increased $126 million in the first    \nnine months of 2021, compared with the first  \nnine months of 2020, due to favorable         \n                      \n  34    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nfunding and deposit mix, partially offset by  \nhigher premium amortization within the        \ninvestment portfolio compared with the prior  \nyear. Noninterest income decreased $4 million \n(1.8 percent) in the third quarter and        \nincreased $14 million (2.0 percent) in the    \nfirst nine months of 2021, compared with the  \nsame periods of 2020, reflecting changes in   \nother noninterest income driven by lower      \nequity investment income in 2021, offset by   \nthe impact of asset impairments in 2020 as a  \nresult of branch closures. The increase in    \nnoninterest income in the first nine months of\n2021, compared with the first nine months of  \n2020, was further offset by lower gains on    \nsales of businesses in 2021 and lower         \nsecurities gains. Noninterest expense         \ndecreased $34 million (14.8 percent) in the   \nthird quarter and $35 million (4.6 percent) in\nthe first nine months of 2021, compared with  \nthe same periods of 2020, primarily due to    \nlower COVID-19related expenses compared with  \nthe prior year, including recognizing         \nliabilities related to future delivery        \nexposures for merchant and airline processing,\nlower net shared services expense and lower   \namortization related to tax-                  \nadvantagedinvestments which were scaled back  \nin 2020 during the pandemic. These decreases  \nwere partially offset by higher compensation  \nexpense as a result of merit increases and    \nhigher performance-based incentives. The      \nprovision for credit losses decreased $544    \nmillion in the third quarter and $3.3 billion \nin the first nine months of 2021, compared    \nwith the same periods of 2020, reflecting the \nresidual impact of changes in the allowance   \nfor credit losses being impacted by improving \neconomic conditions in the current year,      \ncompared to deteriorating conditions in the   \nprior year. Income taxes are assessed to each \nline of business at a managerial tax rate of  \n25.0 percent with the residual tax expense or \nbenefit to arrive at the consolidated         \neffective tax rate included in Treasury and   \nCorporate Support. NON-GAAPFINANCIAL MEASURES \nIn addition to capital ratios defined by      \nbanking regulators, the Company considers     \nvarious other measures when evaluating capital\nutilization and adequacy, including:          \n                                              \n  \u2022    Tangible common equity to tangible     \n       assets,                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Tangible common equity to              \n       risk-weighted assets, and              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Common equity tier\u00a01 capital to        \n  \u2022    risk-weighted assets, reflecting the   \n       full implementation of the CECL        \n       methodology.                           \n                                              \nThese capital measures are viewed by          \nmanagement as useful additional methods of    \nevaluating the Company\u2019s utilization of its   \ncapital held and the level of capital         \navailable to withstand unexpected negative    \nmarket or economic conditions. Additionally,  \npresentation of these measures allows         \ninvestors, analysts and banking regulators to \nassess the Company\u2019s capital position relative\nto other financial services companies. These  \ncapital measures are not defined in generally \naccepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), or   \nare not currently effective or defined in     \nbanking regulations. In addition, certain of  \nthese measures differ from currently effective\ncapital ratios defined by banking regulations \nprincipally in that the currently effective   \nratios, which are subject to certain          \ntransitional provisions, temporarily exclude  \nthe impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting \nguidance related to impairment of financial   \ninstruments based on the CECL methodology. As \na result, these capital measures disclosed by \nthe Company may be considered non-            \nGAAPfinancial measures. Management believes   \nthis information helps investors assess trends\nin the Company\u2019s capital adequacy. The Company\nalso discloses net interest income and related\nratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent   \nbasis, which may also be considered non-      \nGAAPfinancial measures. The Company believes  \nthis presentation to be the preferred industry\nmeasurement of net interest income as it      \nprovides a relevant comparison of net interest\nincome arising from taxable and tax-          \nexemptsources. In addition, certain           \nperformance measures, including the efficiency\nratio and net interest margin utilize net     \ninterest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.\nThere may be limits in the usefulness of these\nmeasures to investors. As a result, the       \nCompany encourages readers to consider the    \nconsolidated financial statements and other   \nfinancial information contained in this report\nin their entirety, and not to

Critical accounting policies are  \nthose policies management believes are the    \nmost important to the portrayal of the        \nCompany\u2019s financial condition and results, and\nrequire management to make estimates that are \ndifficult, subjective or complex. Most        \naccounting policies are not considered by     \nmanagement to be critical accounting policies.\nManagement has discussed the development and  \nthe selection of critical accounting policies \nwith the Company\u2019s Audit Committee. Those     \npolicies considered to be critical accounting \npolicies relate to the allowance for credit   \nlosses, fair value estimates, MSRs, and income\ntaxes. These accounting policies are discussed\nin detail in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and     \nAnalysis \u2014 Critical Accounting Policies\u201d and  \nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor\nthe year ended December 31, 2020. CONTROLS AND\nPROCEDURES Under the supervision and with the \nparticipation of the Company\u2019s management,    \nincluding its principal executive officer and \nprincipal financial officer, the Company has  \nevaluated the effectiveness of the design and \noperation of its disclosure controls and      \nprocedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)and  \n15d-15(e)under the Securities Exchange Act of \n1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)). Based upon this   \nevaluation, the principal executive officer   \nand principal financial officer have concluded\nthat, as of the end of the period covered by  \nthis report, the Company\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures were effective. During the most\nrecently completed fiscal quarter, there was  \nno change made in the Company\u2019s internal      \ncontrol over financial reporting (as defined  \nin Rules 13a-15(f)and 15d-15(f)under the      \nExchange Act) that has materially affected, or\nis reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial     \nreporting.

Under the        \nguidance, a company can elect not to apply    \ncertain modification accounting requirements  \nto contracts affected by reference rate       \ntransition, if certain criteria are met. A    \ncompany that makes this election would not be \nrequired to remeasure the contracts at the    \nmodification date or reassess a previous      \naccounting determination. This guidance also  \npermits a company to elect various optional   \nexpedients that would allow it to continue    \napplying hedge accounting for hedging         \nrelationships affected by reference rate      \ntransition, if certain criteria are met. The  \nguidance is effective upon issuance and       \ngenerally can be applied through December 31, \n2022. The Company is in the process of        \nevaluating and applying, as applicable, the   \noptional expedients and exceptions in         \naccounting for eligible contract              \nmodifications, eligible existing hedging      \nrelationships and new hedging relationships   \navailable through December 31, 2022. The      \nadoption of this guidance has not had, and is \nexpected to continue to not have, a material  \nimpact on the Company\u2019s financial statements. \n                                   \n  Note\u00a03    Business Combinations  \n                                   \nIn September 2021, the Company announced that \nit has entered into a definitive agreement to \nacquire MUFG Union Bank\u2019s core regional       \nbanking franchise from Mitsubishi UFJ         \nFinancial Group (\u201cMUFG\u201d), for a purchase price\nof approximately $ 8.0billion, including $    \n5.5billion in cash and approximately 44million\nshares of the Company\u2019s common stock.

The transaction excludes the    \npurchase of MUFG Union Bank\u2019s Global Corporate\n& Investment Bank, certain middle and back    \noffice functions, and other assets.

If the Company    \nintends to sell or it is more likely than not \nthe Company will be required to sell an       \ninvestment security, the amortized cost of the\nsecurity is written down to fair value. When  \nevaluating credit losses, the Company         \nconsiders various factors such as the nature  \nof the investment security, the credit ratings\nor financial condition of the issuer, the     \nextent of the unrealized loss, expected cash  \nflows of underlying collateral, the existence \nof any government or agency guarantees, and   \nmarket conditions. The Company measures the   \nallowance for credit losses using market      \ninformation where available and discounting   \nthe cash flows at the original effective rate \nof the investment security. The allowance for \ncredit losses is adjusted each period through \nearnings and can be subsequently recovered.   \nThe allowance for credit losses on the        \nCompany\u2019s available-for-sale investment       \nsecurities was immaterial at September 30,    \n2021 and December 31, 2020.                   \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    43  \n                      \n              Table of Contents               \nAt September 30, 2021, certain investment     \nsecurities had a fair value below amortized   \ncost.

Originated loans are reported at\nthe principal amount outstanding, net of      \nunearned interest and deferred fees and costs,\nand any partial charge-offs recorded. Net     \nunearned interest and deferred fees and costs \namounted to $ 567million at September 30, 2021\nand $ 763million at December 31, 2020. All    \npurchased loans are recorded at fair value at \nthe date of purchase. Beginning January 1,    \n2020, the Company evaluates purchased loans   \nfor more-than-insignificant deterioration at  \nthe date of purchase in accordance with       \napplicable authoritative accounting guidance. \nPurchased loans that have experienced more-   \nthan-insignificant deterioration from         \norigination are considered purchased credit   \ndeteriorated loans. All other purchased loans \nare considered non-purchasedcredit            \ndeteriorated loans. Allowance for Credit      \nLosses Beginning January 1, 2020, the         \nallowance for credit losses is established for\ncurrent expected credit losses on the         \nCompany\u2019s loan and lease portfolio, including \nunfunded credit commitments. The allowance    \nconsiders expected losses for the remaining   \nlives of the applicable assets, inclusive of  \nexpected recoveries. The allowance for credit \nlosses is increased through provisions charged\nto earnings and reduced by net charge-offs.   \nManagement evaluates the appropriateness of   \nthe allowance for credit losses on a quarterly\nbasis. Multiple economic scenarios are        \nconsidered over a three-year reasonable and   \nsupportable forecast period, which includes   \nincreasing consideration of historical loss   \nexperience over years two and three. These    \neconomic scenarios are constructed with       \ninterrelated projections of multiple economic \nvariables, and loss estimates are produced    \nthat consider the historical correlation of   \nthose economic variables with credit losses.  \nAfter the forecast period, the Company fully  \nreverts to long-term historical loss          \nexperience, adjusted for prepayments and      \ncharacteristics of the current loan and lease \nportfolio, to estimate losses over the        \nremaining life of the portfolio. The economic \nscenarios are updated at least quarterly and  \nare designed to provide a range of reasonable \nestimates, from better to worse than current  \nexpectations. Scenarios are weighted based on \nthe Company\u2019s expectation of economic         \nconditions for the foreseeable future and     \nreflect significant judgment and consideration\nof uncertainties that exist. Final loss       \nestimates also consider factors affecting     \ncredit losses not reflected in the scenarios, \ndue to the unique aspects of current          \nconditions and expectations. These factors may\ninclude, but are not limited to, loan         \nservicing practices, regulatory guidance,     \nand/or fiscal and monetary policy actions. The\nallowance recorded for credit losses utilizes \nforward-looking expected loss models to       \nconsider a variety of factors affecting       \nlifetime credit losses. These factors include,\nbut are not limited to, macroeconomic         \nvariables such as unemployment rate, real     \nestate prices, gross domestic product levels  \nand corporate bonds spreads, as well as loan  \nand borrower characteristics, such as internal\nrisk ratings on commercial loans and consumer \ncredit scores, delinquency                    \n                      \n  46    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nstatus, collateral type and available         \nvaluation information, consideration of end-  \nof-termlosses on lease residuals, and the     \nremaining term of the loan, adjusted for      \nexpected prepayments. For each loan portfolio,\nmodel estimates are adjusted as necessary to  \nconsider any relevant changes in portfolio    \ncomposition, lending policies, underwriting   \nstandards, risk management practices, economic\nconditions or other factors that would affect \nthe accuracy of the model. Expected credit    \nloss estimates also include consideration of  \nexpected cash recoveries on loans previously  \ncharged-offor expected recoveries on          \ncollateral dependent loans where recovery is  \nexpected through sale of the collateral. Where\nloans do not exhibit similar risk             \ncharacteristics, an individual analysis is    \nperformed to consider expected credit losses. \nThe allowance recorded for individually       \nevaluated loans greater than $ 5million in the\ncommercial lending segment is based on an     \nanalysis utilizing expected cash flows        \ndiscounted using the original effective       \ninterest rate, the observable market price of \nthe loan, or the fair value of the collateral,\nless selling costs, for collateral-dependent  \nloans as appropriate. The allowance recorded  \nfor Troubled Debt Restructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d) loans \nin the consumer lending segment is determined \non a homogenous pool basis utilizing expected \ncash flows discounted using the original      \neffective interest rate of the pool. TDRs     \ngenerally do not include loan modifications   \ngranted to customers resulting directly from  \nthe economic effects of the COVID-19pandemic, \nwho were otherwise in current payment status. \nThe expected cash flows on TDR loans consider \nsubsequent payment defaults since             \nmodification, the borrower\u2019s ability to pay   \nunder the restructured terms, and the timing  \nand amount of payments. The allowance for     \ncollateral-dependent loans in the consumer    \nlending segment is determined based on the    \nfair value of the collateral less costs to    \nsell. With respect to the commercial lending  \nsegment, TDRs may be collectively evaluated   \nfor impairment where observed performance     \nhistory, including defaults, is a primary     \ndriver of the loss allocation. For commercial \nTDRs individually evaluated for impairment,   \nattributes of the borrower are the primary    \nfactors in determining the allowance for      \ncredit losses. However, historical loss       \nexperience is also incorporated into the      \nallowance methodology applied to this category\nof loans. Beginning January 1, 2020, when a   \nloan portfolio is purchased, the acquired     \nloans are divided into those considered       \npurchased with more than insignificant credit \ndeterioration (\u201cPCD\u201d) and those not considered\npurchased with more than insignificant credit \ndeterioration. An allowance is established for\neach population and considers product mix,    \nrisk characteristics of the portfolio,        \nbankruptcy experience, delinquency status and \nrefreshed LTV ratios when possible. The       \nallowance established for purchased loans not \nconsidered PCD is recognized through provision\nexpense upon acquisition, whereas the         \nallowance established for loans considered PCD\nat acquisition is offset by an increase in the\nbasis of the acquired loans. Any subsequent   \nincreases and decreases in the allowance      \nrelated to purchased loans, regardless of PCD \nstatus, are recognized through provision      \nexpense, with charge-offs charged to the      \nallowance. The Company did not have a material\namount of PCD loans included in its loan      \nportfolio at September 30, 2021. The Company\u2019s\nmethodology for determining the appropriate   \nallowance for credit losses also considers the\nimprecision inherent in the methodologies used\nand allocated to the various loan portfolios. \nAs a result, amounts determined under the     \nmethodologies described above, are adjusted by\nmanagement to consider the potential impact of\nother qualitative factors not captured in the \nquantitative model adjustments which include, \nbut are not limited to the following: model   \nimprecision, imprecision in economic scenario \nassumptions, and emerging risks related to    \neither changes in the environment that are    \naffecting specific portfolios, or changes in  \nportfolio concentrations over time that may   \naffect model performance. The consideration of\nthese items results in adjustments to         \nallowance amounts included in the Company\u2019s   \nallowance for credit losses for each loan     \nportfolio. The Company also assesses the      \ncredit risk associated with off-balancesheet  \nloan commitments, letters of credit,          \ninvestment securities and derivatives. Credit \nrisk associated with derivatives is reflected \nin the fair values recorded for those         \npositions. The liability for off-balancesheet \ncredit exposure related to loan commitments   \nand other credit guarantees is included in    \nother liabilities. Because business processes \nand credit risks associated with unfunded     \ncredit commitments are essentially the same as\nfor loans, the Company utilizes similar       \nprocesses to estimate its liability for       \nunfunded credit commitments. Prior to January \n1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses was  \nestablished based on an incurred loss model.  \nThe allowance recorded for loans in the       \ncommercial lending segment was based on the   \nmigration analysis of commercial loans and    \nactual loss experience. The allowance recorded\nfor loans in the consumer lending segment was \ndetermined on a homogenous pool basis and     \nprimarily included consideration of           \ndelinquency status and historical losses. In  \naddition to the amounts determined under the  \nmethodologies described above, management also\nconsidered the potential impact of qualitative\nfactors.                                      \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    47  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nActivity in the allowance for credit losses by\nportfolio class was as follows:               \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026                                \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      $      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026           \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      3      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      3      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      4      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n             \u2026                                \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      6      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      \u2026      $      \u2026      \u2026      $      \u2026    \n             \u2026                    \u2026           \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Effective January\u00a01, 2020, the         \n       Company adopted accounting guidance    \n       which changed impairment recognition   \n       of financial instruments to a model    \n       that is based on expected losses       \n  (a)  rather than incurred losses.           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nThe decrease in the allowance for credit      \nlosses from December 31, 2020 to September 30,\n2021 primarily reflected factors affecting    \neconomic conditions during the first nine     \nmonths of 2021, including the enactment of    \nadditional benefits from government stimulus  \nprograms and broad vaccine availability in the\nUnited States that has reduced the risks      \nassociated with COVID-19,contributing to an   \neconomic recovery and strong portfolio credit \nperformance. Other factors considered include \nconcerns around inflationary pressures, new   \nvirus variants, sustainability of asset values\nand borrower liquidity, along with the lack of\na clear path to government funding.           \n                                              \nCredit Quality The credit quality of the      \nCompany\u2019s loan portfolios is assessed as a    \nfunction of net credit losses, levels of      \nnonperforming assets and delinquencies, and   \ncredit quality ratings as defined by the      \nCompany.                                      \n                                              \nFor all loan portfolio classes, loans are     \nconsidered past due based on the number of    \ndays delinquent except for monthly amortizing \nloans which are classified delinquent based   \nupon the number of cont ractually required    \npayments not made (for example, two missed    \npayments is considered 30 days delinquent).   \nWhen a loan is placed on nonaccrual status,   \nunpaid accrued interest is reversed, reducing \ninterest income in the current period.        \n                                              \nCommercial lending segment loans are generally\nplaced on nonaccrual status when the          \ncollection of principal and interest has      \nbecome 90 days past due or is otherwise       \nconsidered doubtful. Commercial lending       \nsegment loans are generally fully or partially\ncharged down to the fair value of the         \ncollateral securing the loan, less costs to   \nsell, when the loan is placed on nonaccrual.  \n                                              \nConsumer lending segment loans are generally  \ncharged-off at a specific number of days or   \npayments past due. Residential mortgages and  \nother retail loans secured by 1-4 family      \nproperties are generally charged down to the  \nfair                                          \n                      \n  48    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nvalue of the collateral securing the loan,    \nless costs to sell, at 180 days past due.     \nResidential mortgage loans and lines in a     \nfirst lien position are placed on nonaccrual  \nstatus in instances where a partial charge-off\noccurs unless the loan is well secured and in \nthe process of collection. Residential        \nmortgage loans and lines in a junior lien     \nposition secured by 1-4 family properties are \nplaced on nonaccrual status at 120 days past  \ndue or when they are behind a first lien that \nhas become 180 days or greater past due or    \nplaced on nonaccrual status. Any secured      \nconsumer lending segment loan whose borrower  \nhas had debt discharged through bankruptcy,   \nfor which the loan amount exceeds the fair    \nvalue of the collateral, is charged down to   \nthe fair value of the related collateral and  \nthe remaining balance is placed on nonaccrual \nstatus. Credit card loans continue to accrue  \ninterest until the account is charged-off.    \nCredit cards are charged-off at 180 days past \ndue. Other retail loans not secured by 1-4    \nfamily properties are charged-off at 120 days \npast due; and revolving consumer lines are    \ncharged-off at 180 days past due. Similar to  \ncredit cards, other retail loans are generally\nnot placed on nonaccrual status because of the\nrelative short period of time to charge-off.  \nCertain retail customers having financial     \ndifficulties may have the terms of their      \ncredit card and other loan agreements modified\nto require only principal payments and, as    \nsuch, are reported as nonaccrual.             \n                                              \nFor all loan classes, interest payments       \nreceived on nonaccrual loans are generally    \nrecorded as a reduction to a loan\u2019s carrying  \namount while a loan is on nonaccrual and are  \nrecognized as interest income upon payoff of  \nthe loan. However, interest income may be     \nrecognized for interest payments if the       \nremaining carrying amount of the loan is      \nbelieved to be collectible. In certain        \ncircumstances, loans in any class may be      \nrestored to accrual status, such as when a    \nloan has demonstrated sustained repayment     \nperformance or no amounts are past due and    \nprospects for future payment are no longer in \ndoubt; or when the loan becomes well secured  \nand is in the process of collection. Loans    \nwhere there has been a partial charge-off may \nbe returned to accrual status if all principal\nand interest (including amounts previously    \ncharged-off) is expected to be collected and  \nthe loan is current.                          \nThe following table provides a summary of     \nloans by portfolio class, including the       \ndelinquency status of those that continue to  \naccrue interest, and those that are           \nnonperforming:                                \n                                              \n  (\u2026                       90                 \n  in                      Da\u2026                 \n  M\u2026                       or                 \n  S\u2026                      Mo\u2026                 \n  3\u2026       Ac\u2026    30-\u2026    Pa\u2026    Non\u2026         \n  2\u2026       Cu\u2026    Days    Due     (b)    To\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  C\u2026    $  10\u2026       $      $       $    $1\u2026  \n                   163     39     216         \n  C\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026       38\u2026      32     21     296    38\u2026  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026       74\u2026     153    114     237    74\u2026  \n  (\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026       21\u2026     183    147       \u2013    22\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       60\u2026     251     64     157    60\u2026  \n  r\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026    $  29\u2026       $    $3\u2026       $    $2\u2026  \n  l\u2026               782            906         \n  D\u2026                                          \n  3\u2026                                          \n  2\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026    $  10\u2026       $      $       $    $1\u2026  \n                   314     55     375         \n  C\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026       38\u2026     183      2     450    39\u2026  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026       75\u2026     244    137     245    76\u2026  \n  (\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026       21\u2026     231    197       \u2013    22\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       56\u2026     318     86     154    57\u2026  \n  r\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026    $  29\u2026    $1,\u2026    $4\u2026    $1,\u2026    $2\u2026  \n  l\u2026                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       At September\u00a030, 2021, $946million of  \n       loans 30\u201389 days past due and          \n       $1.5billion of loans 90 days or more   \n       past due purchased from Government     \n       National Mortgage Association          \n       (\u201cGNMA\u201d) mortgage pools whose          \n  (a)  repayments are insured by the Federal  \n       Housing Administration or guaranteed   \n       by the United States Department of     \n       Veterans Affairs, were classified as   \n       current, compared with $1.4billion     \n       and $1.8billion at December\u00a031, 2020,  \n       respectively.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Substantially all nonperforming loans  \n       at September\u00a030, 2021 and December\u00a0    \n       31, 2020, had an associated allowance  \n       for credit losses.

The post-       \nmodification balances for these loans reflect \nthe current outstanding balance until a       \npermanent modification is made. In addition,  \nthe post-modification balances typically      \ninclude capitalization of unpaid accrued      \ninterest and/or fees under the various        \nmodification programs.At September 30, 2021,  \n5residential mortgages, 2home equity and      \nsecond mortgage loans and 43loans purchased   \nfrom GNMA mortgage pools with outstanding     \nbalances of less than $ 1million, less than $ \n1million and $ 5million, respectively, were in\na trial period and have estimated post-       \nmodification balances of less than $ 1million,\nless than $ 1million and $ 5million,          \nrespectively, assuming permanent modification \noccurs at the end of the trial period.        \n                                              \nThe Company has implemented certain           \nrestructuring programs that may result in     \nTDRs. However, many of the Company\u2019s TDRs are \nalso determined on a case-by-case basis in    \nconnection with ongoing loan collection       \nprocesses.                                    \n                                              \nFor the commercial lending segment,           \nmodifications generally result in the Company \nworking with borrowers on a case-by-case      \nbasis. Commercial and commercial real estate  \nmodifications generally include extensions of \nthe maturity date and may be accompanied by an\nincrease or decrease to the interest rate,    \nwhich may not be deemed a market interest     \nrate. In addition, the Company may work with  \nthe borrower in identifying other changes that\nmitigate loss to the Company, which may       \ninclude additional collateral or guarantees to\nsupport the loan. To a lesser extent, the     \nCompany may waive contractual principal. The  \nCompany classifies all of the above           \nconcessions as TDRs to the extent the Company \ndetermines that the borrower is experiencing  \nfinancial difficulty.                         \n                                              \nModifications for the consumer lending segment\nare generally part of programs the Company has\ninitiated. The Company modifies residential   \nmortgage loans under Federal Housing          \nAdministration, United States Department of   \nVeterans Affairs, or its own internal         \nprograms. Under these programs, the Company   \noffers qualifying homeowners the opportunity  \nto permanently modify their loan and achieve  \nmore affordable monthly payments by providing \nloan concessions. These concessions may       \ninclude adjustments to interest rates,        \nconversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates,\nextension of maturity dates or deferrals of   \npayments, capitalization of accrued interest  \nand/or outstanding advances, or in limited    \nsituations, partial forgiveness of loan       \nprincipal. In most instances, participation in\nresidential mortgage loan restructuring       \nprograms requires the customer to complete a  \nshort-term trial period.

These    \nloans had aggregate outstanding balances of $ \n1million and $ 7million for the three months  \nand nine months ended September 30, 2021,     \nrespectively.                                 \n                                              \nAs of September 30, 2021, the Company had $   \n158million of commitments to lend additional  \nfunds to borrowers whose terms of their       \noutstanding owed balances have been modified  \nin TDRs.                                      \n                                              \n            Accounting\u00a0for\u00a0Transfers\u00a0and\u00a0     \n  Note\u00a06    Servicing\u00a0of\u00a0Financial\u00a0Assets\u00a0    \n            and\u00a0Variable\u00a0Interest\u00a0Entities    \n                                              \nThe Company transfers financial assets in the \nnormal course of business. The majority of the\nCompany\u2019s financial asset transfers are       \nresidential mortgage loan sales primarily to  \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d),    \ntransfers of tax-advantaged investments,      \ncommercial loan sales through participation   \nagreements, and other individual or portfolio \nloan and securities sales. In accordance with \nthe accounting guidance for asset transfers,  \nthe Company considers any ongoing involvement \nwith transferred assets in determining whether\nthe assets can be derecognized from the       \nbalance sheet. Guarantees provided to certain \nthird parties in connection with the transfer \nof assets are further discussed in Note 16.   \nFor loans sold under participation agreements,\nthe Company also considers whether the terms  \nof the loan participation agreement meet the  \naccounting definition of a participating      \ninterest. With the exception of servicing and \ncertain performance-based guarantees, the     \nCompany\u2019s continuing involvement with         \nfinancial assets sold is minimal and generally\nlimited to market customary representation and\nwarranty clauses. Any gain or loss on sale    \ndepends on the                                \n                      \n  52    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nprevious carrying amount of the transferred   \nfinancial assets, the consideration received, \nand any liabilities incurred in exchange for  \nthe transferred assets. Upon transfer, any    \nservicing assets and other interests that     \ncontinue to be held by the Company are        \ninitially recognized at fair value. For       \nfurther information on mortgage servicing     \nrights (\u201cMSRs\u201d), refer to Note 7. On a limited\nbasis, the Company may acquire and package    \nhigh-grade corporate bonds for select         \ncorporate customers, in which the Company     \ngenerally has no continuing involvement with  \nthese transactions. Additionally, the Company \nis an authorized GNMA issuer and issues GNMA  \nsecurities on a regular basis. The Company has\nno other asset securitizations or similar     \nasset-backed financing arrangements that are  \noff-balance sheet.                            \n                                              \nThe Company also provides financial support   \nprimarily through the use of waivers of trust \nand investment management fees associated with\nvarious unconsolidated registered money market\nfunds it manages. The Company provided $      \n67million and $ 28million of support to the   \nfunds during the three months ended September \n30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $        \n184million and $ 49million during the nine    \nmonths ended September 30, 2021 and 2020,     \nrespectively.                                 \n                                              \nThe Company is involved in various entities   \nthat are considered to be variable interest   \nentities (\u201cVIEs\u201d). The Company\u2019s investments  \nin VIEs are primarily related to investments  \npromoting affordable housing, community       \ndevelopment and renewable energy sources. Some\nof these tax-advantaged investments support   \nthe Company\u2019s regulatory compliance with the  \nCommunity Reinvestment Act. The Company\u2019s     \ninvestments in these entities generate a      \nreturn primarily through the realization of   \nfederal and state income tax credits, and     \nother tax benefits, such as tax deductions    \nfrom operating losses of the investments, over\nspecified time periods. These tax credits are \nrecognized as a reduction of tax expense or,  \nfor investments qualifying as investment tax  \ncredits, as a reduction to the related        \ninvestment asset. The Company recognized      \nfederal and state income tax credits related  \nto its affordable housing and other tax-      \nadvantaged investments in tax expense of $ 113\nmillion and $ 142 million for the three months\nended September\u00a030, 2021 and 2020,            \nrespectively, and $ 356 million and $ 437     \nmillion for the nine months ended             \nSeptember\u00a030, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The\nCompany also recognized $ 75 million and $ 118\nmillion of investment tax credits for the     \nthree months ended September\u00a030, 2021 and     \n2020, respectively, and $ 235 million and $   \n307 million for the nine months ended         \nSeptember\u00a030, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The\nCompany recognized $ 101 million and $ 142    \nmillion of expenses related to all of these   \ninvestments for the three months ended        \nSeptember\u00a030, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of \nwhich $ 83 million and $ 97 million,          \nrespectively, were included in tax expense and\nthe remaining amounts were included in        \nnoninterest expense. The C ompany recognized $\n333 million and $ 429 million of expenses     \nrelated to all of these investments for the   \nnine months ended September\u00a030, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively, of which $ 262 million and $ 297\nmillion, respectively, were included in tax   \nexpense and the remaining amounts were        \nincluded in noninterest expense.              \nThe Company is not required to consolidate    \nVIEs in which it has concluded it does not    \nhave a controlling financial interest, and    \nthus is not the primary beneficiary. In such  \ncases, the Company does not have both the     \npower to direct the entities\u2019 most significant\nactivities and the obligation to absorb losses\nor the right to receive benefits that could   \npotentially be significant to the VIEs.       \nThe Company\u2019s investments in these            \nunconsolidated VIEs are carried in other      \nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The \nCompany\u2019s unfunded capital and other          \ncommitments related to these unconsolidated   \nVIEs are generally carried in other           \nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe Company\u2019s maximum exposure to loss from   \nthese unconsolidated VIEs include the         \ninvestment recorded on the Company\u2019s          \nConsolidated Balance Sheet, net of unfunded   \ncapital commitments, and previously recorded  \ntax credits which remain subject to recapture \nby taxing authorities based on compliance     \nfeatures required to be met at the project    \nlevel. While the Company believes potential   \nlosses from these investments are remote, the \nmaximum exposure was determined by assuming a \nscenario where the community-based business   \nand housing projects completely fail and do   \nnot meet certain government compliance        \nrequirements resulting in recapture of the    \nrelated tax credits.                          \nThe following table provides a summary of     \ninvestments in community development and tax- \nadvantaged VIEs that the Company has not      \nconsolidated:                                 \n                                              \n  (Dollars         September        December  \n  in                     30,             31,  \n  Millions)             2021            2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Investme\u2026                                   \n  carrying     $       4,865    $      5,378  \n  amount                                      \n  Unfunded                                    \n  capital              2,180           2,334  \n  and other                                   \n  commitme\u2026                                   \n  Maximum                                     \n  exposure            10,368          11,219  \n  to loss                                     \n                                              \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    53  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe Company also has noncontrolling financial \ninvestments in private investment funds and   \npartnerships considered to be VIEs, which are \nnot consolidated. The Company\u2019s recorded      \ninvestment in these entities, carried in other\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, was \napproximately $ 40million at September 30,    \n2021 and $ 35million at December 31, 2020. The\nmaximum exposure to loss related to these VIEs\nwas $ 81million at September 30, 2021 and $   \n57million at December 31, 2020, representing  \nthe Company\u2019s investment balance and its      \nunfunded commitments to invest additional     \namounts. The Company\u2019s individual net         \ninvestments in unconsolidated VIEs, which     \nexclude any unfunded capital commitments,     \nranged from less than $ 1million to $         \n71million at September 30, 2021, compared with\nless than $ 1million to $ 78million at        \nDecember 31, 2020. The Company is required to \nconsolidate VIEs in which it has concluded it \nhas a controlling financial interest. The     \nCompany sponsors entities to which it         \ntransfers its interests in tax-               \nadvantagedinvestments to third parties.At     \nSeptember 30, 2021, approximately $ 5.1billion\nof the Company\u2019s assets and $ 3.6billion of   \nits liabilities included on the Consolidated  \nBalance Sheet were related to community       \ndevelopment and tax-advantagedinvestment VIEs \nwhich the Company has consolidated, primarily \nrelated to these transfers. These amounts     \ncompared to $ 4.9billion and $ 3.7billion,    \nrespectively, at December 31, 2020. The       \nmajority of the assets of these consolidated  \nVIEs are reported in other assets, and the    \nliabilities are reported in long-term debt and\nother liabilities. The assets of a particular \nVIE are the primary source of funds to settle \nits obligations. The creditors of the VIEs do \nnot have recourse to the general credit of the\nCompany. The Company\u2019s exposure to the        \nconsolidated VIEs is generally limited to the \ncarrying value of its variable interests plus \nany related tax credits previously recognized \nor transferred to others with a guarantee. In \naddition, the Company sponsors a municipal    \nbond securities tender option bond program.   \nThe Company controls the activities of the    \nprogram\u2019s entities, is entitled to the        \nresidual returns and provides liquidity and   \nremarketing arrangements to the program. As a \nresult, the Company has consolidated the      \nprogram\u2019s entities. At September 30, 2021, $  \n1.7billion of available-for-saleinvestment    \nsecurities and $ 1.2billion of short-term     \nborrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet  \nwere related to the tender option bond        \nprogram, compared with $ 2.4billion of        \navailable-for-saleinvestment securities and $ \n1.5billion of short-term borrowings at        \nDecember 31, 2020.                            \n                                       \n  Note\u00a07    Mortgage Servicing Rights  \n                                       \nThe Company capitalizes MSRs as separate      \nassets when loans are sold and servicing is   \nretained. MSRs may also be purchased from     \nothers. The Company carries MSRs at fair      \nvalue, with changes in the fair value recorded\nin earnings during the period in which they   \noccur. The Company serviced $ 219.3billion of \nresidential mortgage loans for others at      \nSeptember 30, 2021, and $ 211.8billion at     \nDecember 31, 2020, including subserviced      \nmortgages with no corresponding MSR asset.    \nIncluded in mortgage banking revenue are the  \nMSR fair value changes arising from market    \nrate and model assumption changes, net of the \nvalue change in derivatives used to           \neconomically hedge MSRs. These changes        \nresulted in a net loss of $ 21million and a   \nnet gain of $ 9million for the three months   \nended September 30, 2021 and 2020,            \nrespectively, and a net loss of $ 168million  \nand a net gain of $ 58million for the nine    \nmonths ended September 30, 2021 and 2020,     \nrespectively. Loan servicing and ancillary    \nfees, not including valuation changes,        \nincluded in mortgage banking revenue were $   \n183million and $ 177million for the three     \nmonths ended September 30, 2021 and 2020,     \nrespectively, and $ 536million and $          \n537million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.              \nChanges in fair value of capitalized MSRs are \nsummarized as follows:                        \n                                              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026          \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026         \u2026    \n         9          8          \u2026         \u2026    \n         \u2026          \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n         \u2014          1          1         3    \n                                              \n         \u2026          \u2026  )       \u2026         \u2026    \n         \u2026  )       \u2026  )       \u2026  )      \u2026    \n         \u2026  )       \u2026  )       \u2026  )      \u2026    \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026         \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n       MSRs sold include those having a       \n  (a)  negative fair value, resulting from    \n       the loans being severely delinquent.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Includes changes in MSR value          \n       associated with changes in market      \n  (b)  interest rates, including estimated    \n       prepayment rates and anticipated       \n       earnings on escrow deposits.           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Includes changes in MSR value not      \n       caused by changes in market interest   \n  (c)  rates, such as changes in assumed      \n       cost to service, ancillary income and  \n       option adjusted spread, as well as     \n       the impact of any model changes.       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Primarily the change in MSR value      \n       from passage of time and cash flows    \n       realized (decay), but also includes    \n  (d)  the impact of changes to expected      \n       cash flows not associated with         \n       changes in market interest rates,      \n       such as the impact of delinquencies.   \n                                              \n                      \n  54    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents The estimated sensitivity to\nchanges in interest rates of the fair value of\n the MSR portfolio and the related derivative \n         instruments was as follows:          \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nThe fair value of MSRs and their sensitivity  \nto changes in interest rates is influenced by \nthe mix of the servicing portfolio and        \ncharacteristics of each segment of the        \nportfolio.

The   \nCompany recognizes all derivatives on the     \nConsolidated Balance Sheet at fair value in   \nother assets or in other liabilities. On the  \ndate the Company enters into a derivative     \ncontract, the derivative is designated as     \neither a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge,   \nnet investment hedge, or a designation is not \nmade as it is a customer-related transaction, \nan economic hedge for asset/liability risk    \nmanagement purposes or another stand-alone    \nderivative created through the Company\u2019s      \noperations (\u201cfree-standing derivative\u201d). When \na derivative is designated as a fair value,   \ncash flow or net investment hedge, the Company\nperforms an assessment, at inception and, at a\nminimum, quarterly thereafter, to determine   \nthe effectiveness of the derivative in        \noffsetting changes in the value or cash flows \nof the hedged item(s).                        \nFair Value Hedges These derivatives are       \ninterest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge \nthe change in fair value related to interest  \nrate changes of its underlying available-for- \nsaleinvestment securities and fixed-rate debt.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives      \ndesignated as fair value hedges, and changes  \nin the fair value of the hedged items, are    \nrecorded in earnings.                         \nCash Flow Hedges These derivatives are        \ninterest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge \nthe forecasted cash flows from its underlying \nvariable-rate debt. Changes in the fair value \nof derivatives designated as cash flow hedges \nare recorded in other comprehensive income    \n(loss) until the cash flows of the hedged     \nitems are realized. If a derivative designated\nas a                                          \n                      \n  58    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \ncash flow hedge is terminated or ceases to be \nhighly effective, the gain or loss in other   \ncomprehensive income (loss) is amortized to   \nearnings over the period the forecasted hedged\ntransactions impact earnings. If a hedged     \nforecasted transaction is no longer probable, \nhedge accounting is ceased and any gain or    \nloss included in other comprehensive income   \n(loss) is reported in earnings immediately,   \nunless the forecasted transaction is at least \nreasonably possible of occurring, whereby the \namounts remain within other comprehensive     \nincome (loss). At September 30, 2021, the     \nCompany had $ 95million (net-of-tax)of        \nrealized and unrealized losses on derivatives \nclassified as cash flow hedges recorded in    \nother comprehensive income (loss), compared   \nwith $ 189million (net-of-tax)of realized and \nunrealized losses at December 31, 2020. The   \nestimated amount to be reclassified from other\ncomprehensive income (loss) into earnings     \nduring both the remainder of 2021 and the next\n12 months are losses of $ 1million (net-of-   \ntax).All cash flow hedges were highly         \neffective for the three and nine months ended \nSeptember 30, 2021. Net Investment Hedges The \nCompany uses forward commitments to sell      \nspecified amounts of certain foreign          \ncurrencies, and non-derivativedebt            \ninstruments, to hedge the volatility of its   \nnet investment in foreign operations driven by\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange     \nrates. The carrying amount of non-            \nderivativedebt instruments designated as net  \ninvestment hedges was $ 1.4billion at         \nSeptember 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.     \nOther Derivative Positions The Company enters \ninto free-standing derivatives to mitigate    \ninterest rate risk and for other risk         \nmanagement purposes. These derivatives include\nforward commitments to sell to-be-            \nannouncedsecurities (\u201cTBAs\u201d) and other        \ncommitments to sell residential mortgage      \nloans, which are used to economically hedge   \nthe interest rate risk related to mortgage    \nloans held for sale (\u201cMLHFS\u201d) and unfunded    \nmortgage loan commitments.

The Company measures    \nthat credit risk using a credit valuation     \nadjustment and includes it within the fair    \nvalue of the derivative. The Company manages  \ncounterparty credit risk through              \ndiversification of its derivative positions   \namong various counterparties, by entering into\nderivative positions that are centrally       \ncleared through clearinghouses, by entering   \ninto master netting arrangements and, where   \npossible, by requiring collateral             \narrangements. A master netting arrangement    \nallows two counterparties, who have multiple  \nderivative contracts with each other, the     \nability to net settle amounts under all       \ncontracts, including any related collateral,  \nthrough a single payment and in a single      \ncurrency. Collateral arrangements generally   \nrequire the counterparty to deliver collateral\n(typically cash or U.S. Treasury and agency   \nsecurities) equal to the Company\u2019s net        \nderivative receivable, subject to minimum     \ntransfer and credit rating requirements.      \n                      \n  62    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s collateral arrangements are     \npredominately bilateral and, therefore,       \ncontain provisions that require               \ncollateralization of the Company\u2019s net        \nliability derivative positions. Required      \ncollateral coverage is based on net liability \nthresholds and may be contingent upon the     \nCompany\u2019s credit rating from two of the       \nnationally recognized statistical rating      \norganizations. If the Company\u2019s credit rating \nwere to fall below credit ratings thresholds  \nestablished in the collateral arrangements,   \nthe counterparties to the derivatives could   \nrequest immediate additional collateral       \ncoverage up to and including full collateral  \ncoverage for derivatives in a net liability   \nposition. The aggregate fair value of all     \nderivatives under collateral arrangements that\nwere in a net liability position at September \n30, 2021, was $ 874million. At September 30,  \n2021, the Company had $ 589million of cash    \nposted as collateral against this net         \nliability position.                           \n                                              \n             Netting Arrangements for         \n  Note\u00a014    Certain Financial Instruments    \n             and Securities Financing         \n             Activities                       \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s derivative portfolio consists of\nbilateral over-the-counter trades, certain    \ninterest rate derivatives and credit contracts\nrequired to be centrally cleared through      \nclearinghouses per current regulations, and   \nexchange-traded positions which may include   \nU.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures or       \noptions on U.S. Treasury futures.

For all derivatives under collateral\nsupport arrangements, fair value is determined\ndaily and, depending on the collateral        \nmaintenance requirements, the Company and a   \ncounterparty may receive or deliver           \ncollateral, based upon the net fair value of  \nall derivative positions between the Company  \nand the counterparty. Collateral is typically \ncash, but securities may be allowed under     \ncollateral arrangements with certain          \ncounterparties. Receivables and payables      \nrelated to cash collateral are included in    \nother assets and other liabilities on the     \nConsolidated Balance Sheet, along with the    \nrelated derivative asset and liability fair   \nvalues. Any securities pledged to             \ncounterparties as collateral remain on the    \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Securities        \nreceived from counterparties as collateral are\nnot recognized on the Consolidated Balance    \nSheet, unless the counterparty defaults. In   \ngeneral, securities used as collateral can be \nsold, repledged or otherwise used by the party\nin possession. No restrictions exist on the   \nuse of cash collateral by either party.

Securities sold    \nunder agreements to repurchase include        \nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned   \ntransactions. Securities purchased under      \nagreements to resell include reverse          \nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed \ntransactions. For securities sold under       \nagreements to repurchase, the Company records \na liability for the cash received, which is   \nincluded in short-term borrowings on the      \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. For securities    \npurchased under agreements to resell, the     \nCompany records a receivable for the cash     \npaid, which is included in other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.                   \nSecurities transferred to counterparties under\nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned   \ntransactions continue to be recognized on the \nConsolidated Balance Sheet, are measured at   \nfair value, and are included in investment    \nsecurities or other assets. Securities        \nreceived from counterparties under reverse    \nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed \ntransactions are not recognized on the        \nConsolidated Balance Sheet unless the         \ncounterparty defaults. The securities         \ntransferred under repurchase and reverse      \nrepurchase transactions typically are U.S.    \nTreasury and agency securities, residential   \nagency mortgage-backed securities or corporate\ndebt securities. The securities loaned or     \nborrowed typically are corporate debt         \nsecurities traded by the Company\u2019s broker-    \ndealer subsidiary. In general, the securities \ntransferred can be sold, repledged or         \notherwise used by the party in possession. No \nrestrictions exist on the use of cash         \ncollateral by either party. Repurchase/reverse\nrepurchase and securities loaned/borrowed     \ntransactions expose the Company to            \ncounterparty risk. The Company manages this   \nrisk by performing assessments, independent of\nbusiness line managers, and establishing      \nconcentration limits on each counterparty.    \nAdditionally, these transactions include      \ncollateral arrangements that require the fair \nvalues of the underlying securities to be     \ndetermined daily, resulting in cash being     \nobtained or refunded to counterparties to     \nmaintain specified collateral levels.         \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    63  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe following table summarizes the maturities \nby category of collateral pledged for         \nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned   \ntransactions:                                 \n                                              \n                 \u2026                \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026                \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026       D\u2026       \u2026       T\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  5\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       8\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       6\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       2\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  2\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  4\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       3\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       5\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       2\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  1\u2026  \n                                              \nThe Company executes its derivative,          \nrepurchase/reverse repurchase and securities  \nloaned/borrowed transactions under the        \nrespective industry standard agreements.

Additionally, from time to   \ntime, the Company may be required to record at\nfair value other assets on a nonrecurring     \nbasis, such as loans held for sale, loans held\nfor investment and certain other assets. These\nnonrecurring fair value adjustments typically \ninvolve application of lower-of-cost-or-fair  \nvalue accounting or impairment write-downs of \nindividual assets.                            \nFair value is defined as the exchange price   \nthat would be received for an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability (an exit price) in the   \nprincipal or most advantageous market for the \nasset or liability in an orderly transaction  \nbetween market participants on the measurement\ndate. A fair value measurement reflects all of\nthe assumptions that market participants would\nuse in pricing the asset or liability,        \nincluding assumptions about the risk inherent \nin a particular valuation technique, the      \neffect of a restriction on the sale or use of \nan asset and the risk of nonperformance.      \nThe Company groups its assets and liabilities \nmeasured at fair value into a three-level     \nhierarchy for valuation techniques used to    \nmeasure financial assets and financial        \nliabilities at fair value. This hierarchy is  \nbased on whether the valuation inputs are     \nobservable or unobservable. These levels are: \n                                              \n       Level\u00a01 \u2014 Quoted prices in active      \n       markets for identical assets or        \n  \u2022    liabilities.

Where   \nappropriate, the descriptions include         \ninformation about the valuation models and key\ninputs to those models. During the nine months\nended September 30, 2021 and 2020, there were \nno significant changes to the valuation       \ntechniques used by the Company to measure fair\nvalue. Available-For-SaleInvestment Securities\nWhen quoted market prices for identical       \nsecurities are available in an active market, \nthese prices are used to determine fair value \nand these securities are classified within    \nLevel 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 1  \ninvestment securities include U.S. Treasury   \nand exchange-traded securities. For other     \nsecurities, quoted market prices may not be   \nreadily available for the specific securities.\nWhen possible, the Company determines fair    \nvalue based on market observable information, \nincluding quoted market prices for similar    \nsecurities, inactive transaction prices, and  \nbroker quotes. These securities are classified\nwithin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.   \nLevel 2 valuations are generally provided by a\nthird party pricing service. Level 2          \ninvestment securities are predominantly agency\nmortgage-backed securities, certain other     \nasset-backed securities, obligations of state \nand political subdivisions and agency debt    \nsecurities. Mortgage Loans Held For Sale MLHFS\nmeasured at fair value, for which an active   \nsecondary market and readily available market \nprices exist, are initially valued at the     \ntransaction price and are subsequently valued \nby comparison to instruments with similar     \ncollateral and risk profiles. MLHFS are       \nclassified within Level 2. Included in        \nmortgage banking revenue wasa net loss of $   \n18million and a net gain of $ 97million for   \nthe three months ended September 30, 2021 and \n2020, respectively, and a net loss of $       \n135million and a net gain of $ 271million for \nthe nine months ended September 30, 2021 and  \n2020, respectively, from the changes to fair  \nvalue of these MLHFS under fair value option  \naccounting guidance. Changes in fair value due\nto instrument specific credit risk were       \nimmaterial. Interest income for MLHFS is      \nmeasured based on contractual interest rates  \nand reported as interest income on the        \nConsolidated Statement of Income. Electing to \nmeasure MLHFS at fair value reduces certain   \ntiming differences and better matches changes \nin fair value of these assets with changes in \nthe value of the derivative instruments used  \nto economically hedge them without the burden \nof complying with the requirements for hedge  \naccounting. Mortgage Servicing Rights MSRs are\nvalued using a discounted cash flow           \nmethodology, and are classified within Level  \n3. The Company determines fair value of the   \nMSRs by projecting future cash flows for      \ndifferent interest rate scenarios using       \nprepayment rates and other assumptions, and   \ndiscounts these cash flows using a risk       \nadjusted rate based on option adjusted spread \nlevels. There is minimal observable market    \nactivity for MSRs on comparable portfolios    \nand, therefore, the determination of fair     \nvalue requires significant management         \njudgment. Refer to Note 7 for further         \ninformation on MSR valuation assumptions.     \nDerivatives The majority of derivatives held  \nby the Company are executed over-the-counteror\ncentrally cleared through clearinghouses and  \nare valued using market standard cash flow    \nvaluation techniques. The models incorporate  \ninputs, depending on the type of derivative,  \nincluding interest rate curves, foreign       \nexchange rates and volatility. All derivative \nvalues incorporate an assessment of the risk  \nof counterparty nonperformance, measured based\non the Company\u2019s evaluation of credit risk    \nincluding external assessments of credit risk.\nThe Company monitors and manages its          \nnonperformance risk by considering its ability\nto net derivative positions under master      \nnetting arrangements, as well as collateral   \nreceived or provided under collateral         \narrangements. Accordingly, the Company has    \nelected to measure the fair value of          \nderivatives, at a counterparty level, on a net\nbasis. The majority of the derivatives are    \nclassified within Level 2 of the fair value   \nhierarchy, as the significant inputs to the   \nmodels, including nonperformance risk, are    \nobservable. However, certain derivative       \ntransactions are with counterparties where    \nrisk of nonperformance cannot be observed in  \nthe market and, therefore, the credit         \nvaluation adjustments result in these         \nderivatives being classified within Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy. The Company also has\nother derivative contracts that are created   \nthrough its operations, including commitments \nto purchase and originate mortgage loans and  \nswap agreements executed in conjunction with  \nthe sale of a portion of its Class B common   \nand preferred shares of Visa Inc. (the \u201cVisa  \nswaps\u201d). The mortgage loan commitments are    \nvalued by pricing models that include market  \nobservable and unobservable inputs, which     \nresult in the commitments being classified    \nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.   \nThe unobservable inputs include assumptions   \nabout the percentage of commitments that      \nactually become a closed loan and the MSR     \nvalue that is inherent in the underlying loan \nvalue. The Visa swaps require payments by     \neither the Company or the purchaser of the    \nVisa Inc. Class B common and preferred shares \nwhen there are changes in the conversion rate \nof the Visa Inc. Class B common and preferred \nshares to Visa Inc. Class A common and        \npreferred shares, respectively, as well as    \nquarterly payments to the purchaser based on  \nspecified terms of the agreements. Management \nreviews and updates the Visa swaps fair value \nin conjunction with its                       \n                      \n  66    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nreview of Visa Inc. related litigation        \ncontingencies, and the associated escrow      \nfunding. The expected litigation resolution   \nimpacts the Visa Inc. Class B common share to \nVisa Inc. Class A common share conversion     \nrate, as well as the ultimate termination date\nfor the Visa swaps. Accordingly, the Visa     \nswaps are classified within Level 3. Refer to \nNote 16 for further information on the Visa   \nInc. restructuring and related card           \nassociation litigation.                       \n                                              \nSignificant Unobservable Inputs of Level 3    \nAssets and Liabilities                        \n                                              \nThe following section provides information to \nfacilitate an understanding of the uncertainty\nin the fair value measurements for the        \nCompany\u2019s Level 3 assets and liabilities      \nrecorded at fair value on the Consolidated    \nBalance Sheet. This section includes a        \ndescription of the significant inputs used by \nthe Company and a description of any          \ninterrelationships between these inputs. The  \ndiscussion below excludes nonrecurring fair   \nvalue measurements of collateral value used   \nfor impairment measures for loans and OREO.   \nThese valuations utilize third party appraisal\nor broker price opinions, and are classified  \nas Level 3 due to the significant judgment    \ninvolved.                                     \n                                              \nMortgage Servicing Rights The significant     \nunobservable inputs used in the fair value    \nmeasurement of the Company\u2019s MSRs are expected\nprepayments and the option adjusted spread    \nthat is added to the risk-free rate to        \ndiscount projected cash flows. Significant    \nincreases in either of these inputs in        \nisolation would have resulted in a            \nsignificantly lower fair value measurement.   \nSignificant decreases in either of these      \ninputs in isolation would have resulted in a  \nsignificantly higher fair value measurement.  \nThere is no direct interrelationship between  \nprepayments and option adjusted spread.       \nPrepayment rates generally move in the        \nopposite direction of market interest rates.  \nOption adjusted spread is generally impacted  \nby changes in market return requirements.     \nThe following table shows the significant     \nvaluation assumption ranges for MSRs at       \nSeptember 30, 2021:                           \n                                              \n                                   Weigh\u2026     \n          Minim\u2026       Maxi\u2026       Avera\u2026     \n                                      (a)     \n  Exp\u2026         3  %       13  %        10  %  \n  pre\u2026                                        \n  Opt\u2026                                        \n  adj\u2026         6          11            7     \n  spr\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Determined based on the relative fair  \n  (a)  value of the related mortgage loans    \n       serviced.                              \n                                              \nDerivatives The Company has two distinct Level\n3 derivative portfolios: (i) the Company\u2019s    \ncommitments to purchase and originate mortgage\nloans that meet the requirements of a         \nderivative and (ii) the Company\u2019s             \nasset/liability and customer-related          \nderivatives that are Level 3 due to           \nunobservable inputs related to measurement of \nrisk of nonperformance by the counterparty. In\naddition, the Company\u2019s Visa swaps are        \nclassified within Level 3.                    \n                                              \nThe significant unobservable inputs used in   \nthe fair value measurement of the Company\u2019s   \nderivative commitments to purchase and        \noriginate mortgage loans are the percentage of\ncommitments that actually become a closed loan\nand the MSR value that is inherent in the     \nunderlying loan value. A significant increase \nin the rate of loans that close would have    \nresulted in a larger derivative asset or      \nliability. A significant increase in the      \ninherent MSR value would have resulted in an  \nincrease in the derivative asset or a         \nreduction in the derivative liability.        \nExpected loan close rates and the inherent MSR\nvalues are directly impacted by changes in    \nmarket rates and will generally move in the   \nsame direction as interest rates.             \nThe following table shows the significant     \nvaluation assumption ranges for the Company\u2019s \nderivative commitments to purchase and        \noriginate mortgage loans at September 30,     \n2021:                                         \n                                              \n                                   Weigh\u2026     \n          Minim\u2026       Maxi\u2026       Avera\u2026     \n                                      (a)     \n  Exp\u2026                                        \n  loan         1  %      100  %        76  %  \n  clo\u2026                                        \n  rate                                        \n  Inh\u2026                                        \n  MSR                                         \n  val\u2026                                        \n  (ba\u2026        47         187          121     \n  poi\u2026                                        \n  per                                         \n  loa\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  (a)  Determined based on the relative fair  \n       value of the related mortgage loans.   \n                                              \nThe significant unobservable input used in the\nfair value measurement of certain of the      \nCompany\u2019s asset/liability and customer-related\nderivatives is the credit valuation adjustment\nrelated to the risk of counterparty           \nnonperformance. A significant increase in the \ncredit valuation adjustment would have        \nresulted in a lower fair value measurement. A \nsignificant decrease in the credit valuation  \nadjustment would have resulted in a higher    \nfair value measurement. The credit valuation  \nadjustment is impacted by changes in market   \nrates, volatility, market implied credit      \nspreads, and loss recovery rates, as well as  \nthe Company\u2019s assessment of the counterparty\u2019s\ncredit position.

Inc. card association \nor its affiliates (collectively \u201cVisa\u201d). In   \n2007, Visa completed a restructuring and      \nissued shares of Visa Inc. common stock to its\nfinancial institution members in contemplation\nof its initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d)        \ncompleted in the first quarter of 2008 (the   \n\u201cVisa Reorganization\u201d). As a part of the Visa \nReorganization, the Company received its      \nproportionate number of shares of Visa Inc.   \ncommon stock, which were subsequently         \nconverted to Class B shares of Visa Inc.      \n(\u201cClass B shares\u201d).                           \nVisa U.S.A. Inc. (\u201cVisa U.S.A.\u201d) and          \nMasterCard International (collectively, the   \n\u201cCard Brands\u201d) are defendants in antitrust    \nlawsuits challenging the practices of the Card\nBrands (the \u201cVisa Litigation\u201d). Visa U.S.A.   \nmember banks have a contingent obligation to  \nindemnify Visa Inc. under the Visa U.S.A.     \nbylaws (which were modified at the time of the\nrestructuring in October 2007) for potential  \nlosses arising from the Visa Litigation. The  \nindemnification by the Visa U.S.A. member     \nbanks has no specific maximum amount. Using   \nproceeds from its IPO and through reductions  \nto the conversion ratio applicable to the     \nClass B shares held by Visa U.S.A. member     \nbanks, Visa Inc. has funded an escrow account \nfor the benefit of member financial           \ninstitutions to fund their indemnification    \nobligations associated with the Visa          \nLitigation. The receivable related to the     \nescrow account is classified in other         \nliabilities as a direct offset to the related \nVisa Litigation contingent liability.         \nIn October 2012, Visa signed a settlement     \nagreement to resolve class action claims      \nassociated with the multidistrict interchange \nlitigation pending in the United States       \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork (the \u201cMulti-District Litigation\u201d). The   \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit  \nreversed the approval of that settlement and  \nremanded the matter to the district court.    \nThereafter, the case was split into two       \nputative class actions, one seeking damages   \n(the \u201cDamages Action\u201d) and a separate class   \naction seeking injunctive relief only (the    \n\u201cInjunctive Action\u201d). In September 2018, Visa \nsigned a new settlement agreement, superseding\nthe original settlement agreement, to resolve \nthe Damages Action. The Damages Action        \nsettlement was approved by the United States  \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork, but is now on appeal. The Injunctive    \nAction, which generally seeks changes to Visa \nrules, is still pending.                      \nOther Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities   \nThe following table is a summary of other     \nguarantees and contingent liabilities of the  \nCompany at September 30, 2021:                \n                                              \n                                   Maxi\u2026      \n  (D\u2026                              Pote\u2026      \n  in        Coll\u2026       Car\u2026       Futu\u2026      \n  Mi\u2026        Held       Amo\u2026       Paym\u2026      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  St\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026    $      \u2013    $    60    $  9,556      \n  of                                          \n  cr\u2026                                         \n  Th\u2026                                         \n  pa\u2026           \u2013          \u2013           4      \n  bo\u2026                                         \n  ar\u2026                                         \n  Se\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026       10,4\u2026          \u2013       10,1\u2026      \n  in\u2026                                         \n  As\u2026           \u2013         84       6,793  -a  \n  sa\u2026                                         \n  Me\u2026         827        172       121,\u2026      \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  Te\u2026                                         \n  op\u2026                                         \n  bo\u2026       1,719          \u2013       1,490      \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  gu\u2026                                         \n  Ot\u2026           \u2013         22       1,532      \n                                              \n                                              \n       The maximum potential future payments  \n       do not include loan sales where the    \n       Company provides standard              \n       representation and warranties to the   \n       buyer against losses related to loan   \n       underwriting documentation defects     \n       that may have existed at the time of   \n       sale that generally are identified     \n       after the occurrence of a triggering   \n       event such as delinquency. For these   \n  (a)  types of loan sales, the maximum       \n       potential future payments is           \n       generally the unpaid principal         \n       balance of loans sold measured at the  \n       end of the current reporting period.   \n       Actual losses will be significantly    \n       less than the maximum exposure, as     \n       only a fraction of loans sold will     \n       have a representation and warranty     \n       breach, and any losses on repurchase   \n       would generally be mitigated by any    \n       collateral held against the loans.     \n                                              \nMerchant Processing The Company, through its  \nsubsidiaries, provides merchant processing    \nservices. Under the rules of credit card      \nassociations, a merchant processor retains a  \ncontingent liability for credit card          \ntransactions processed. This contingent       \nliability arises in the event of a billing    \ndispute between the merchant and a cardholder \nthat is ultimately resolved in the            \ncardholder\u2019s favor. In this situation, the    \ntransaction is \u201ccharged-back\u201d to the merchant \nand the disputed                              \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    71  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \namount is credited or otherwise refunded to   \nthe cardholder. If the Company is unable to   \ncollect this amount from the merchant, it     \nbears the loss for the amount of the refund   \npaid to the cardholder. The Company currently \nprocesses card transactions in the United     \nStates, Canada and Europe through wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries. In the event a merchant was     \nunable to fulfill product or services subject \nto future delivery, such as airline tickets,  \nthe Company could become financially liable   \nfor refunding the purchase price of such      \nproducts or services purchased through the    \ncredit card associations under the charge-back\nprovisions. Charge-back risk related to these \nmerchants is evaluated in a manner similar to \ncredit risk assessments and, as such, merchant\nprocessing contracts contain various          \nprovisions to protect the Company in the event\nof default. At September 30, 2021, the value  \nof airline tickets purchased to be delivered  \nat a future date through card transactions    \nprocessed by the Company was $ 7.2billion. The\nCompany held collateral of $ 653million in    \nescrow deposits, letters of credit and        \nindemnities from financial institutions, and  \nliens on various assets. In addition to       \nspecific collateral or other credit           \nenhancements, the Company maintains a         \nliability for its implied guarantees          \nassociated with future delivery. At September \n30, 2021, the liability was $ 155million      \nprimarily related to these airline processing \narrangements. Asset Sales The Company         \nregularly sells loans to GSEs as part of its  \nmortgage banking activities. The Company      \nprovides customary representations and        \nwarranties to GSEs in conjunction with these  \nsales. These representations and warranties   \ngenerally require the Company to repurchase   \nassets if it is subsequently determined that a\nloan did not meet specified criteria, such as \na documentation deficiency or rescission of   \nmortgage insurance. If the Company is unable  \nto cure or refute a repurchase request, the   \nCompany is generally obligated to repurchase  \nthe loan or otherwise reimburse the GSE for   \nlosses. At September 30, 2021, the Company had\nreserved $ 18million for potential losses from\nrepresentation and warranty obligations,      \ncompared with $ 19million at December 31,     \n2020. The Company\u2019s reserve reflects          \nmanagement\u2019s best estimate of losses for      \nrepresentation and warranty obligations. The  \nCompany\u2019s repurchase reserve is modeled at the\nloan level, taking into consideration the     \nindividual credit quality and borrower        \nactivity that has transpired since            \norigination. The model applies credit quality \nand economic risk factors to derive a         \nprobability of default and potential          \nrepurchase that are based on the Company\u2019s    \nhistorical loss experience, and estimates loss\nseverity based on expected collateral value.  \nThe Company also considers qualitative factors\nthat may result in anticipated losses         \ndiffering from historical loss trends. As of  \nSeptember 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the \nCompany had $ 14million and $ 13million,      \nrespectively, of unresolved representation and\nwarranty claims from GSEs. The Company does   \nnot have a significant amount of unresolved   \nclaims from investors other than GSEs.        \nLitigation and Regulatory Matters The Company \nis subject to various litigation and          \nregulatory matters that arise in the ordinary \ncourse of its business. The Company           \nestablishes reserves for such matters when    \npotential losses become probable and can be   \nreasonably estimated. The Company believes the\nultimate resolution of existing legal and     \nregulatory matters will not have a material   \nadverse effect on the financial condition,    \nresults of operations or cash flows of the    \nCompany. However, in light of the             \nuncertainties inherent in these matters, it is\npossible that the ultimate resolution of one  \nor more of these matters may have a material  \nadverse effect on the Company\u2019s results from  \noperations for a particular period, and future\nchanges in circumstances or additional        \ninformation could result in additional        \naccruals or resolution in excess of           \nestablished accruals, which could adversely   \naffect the Company\u2019s results from operations, \npotentially materially. Residential Mortgage- \nBacked Securities Litigation Starting in 2011,\nthe Company and other large financial         \ninstitutions have been sued in their capacity \nas trustee for residential mortgage\u2014backed    \nsecurities trusts. In the lawsuits brought    \nagainst the Company, the investors allege that\nthe Company\u2019s banking subsidiary, U.S. Bank   \nNational Association (\u201cU.S. Bank\u201d), as trustee\ncaused them to incur substantial losses by    \nfailing to enforce loan repurchase obligations\nand failing to abide by appropriate standards \nof care after events of default allegedly     \noccurred. The plaintiffs in these matters seek\nmonetary damages in unspecified amounts and   \nmost also seek equitable relief.              \n                                              \nRegulatory Matters The Company is continually \nsubject to examinations, inquiries and        \ninvestigations in areas of heightened         \nregulatory scrutiny, such as compliance, risk \nmanagement, third-party risk management and   \nconsumer protection. For example, the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) is       \ninvestigating certain of the Company\u2019s        \nconsumer sales practices, and the Company has \nresponded and continues to respond to the     \nCFPB. The Company is cooperating fully with   \nall pending examinations, inquiries and       \ninvestigations, any of which could lead to    \nadministrative or legal proceedings or        \nsettlements. Remedies in these proceedings or \nsettlements may include fines, penalties,     \n                      \n  72    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n Table of Contents restitution or alterations \nin the Company\u2019s business practices (which may\nincrease the Company\u2019s operating expenses and \n            decrease its revenue).            \nOutlook Due to their complex nature, it can be\nyears before litigation and regulatory matters\nare resolved. The Company may be unable to    \ndevelop an estimate or range of loss where    \nmatters are in early stages, there are        \nsignificant factual or legal issues to be     \nresolved, damages are unspecified or          \nuncertain, or there is uncertainty as to a    \nlitigation class being certified or the       \noutcome of pending motions, appeals or        \nproceedings. For those litigation and         \nregulatory matters where the Company has      \ninformation to develop an estimate or range of\nloss, the Company believes the upper end of   \nthe range of reasonably possible losses in    \naggregate, in excess of any reserves          \nestablished for matters where a loss is       \nconsidered probable, will not be material to  \nits financial condition, results of operations\nor cash flows. The Company\u2019s estimates are    \nsubject to significant judgment and           \nuncertainties, and the matters underlying the \nestimates will change from time to time.      \nActual results may vary significantly from the\ncurrent estimates.                            \n                                \n  Note\u00a017    Business Segments  \n                                \nWithin the Company, financial performance is  \nmeasured by major lines of business based on  \nthe products and services provided to         \ncustomers through its distribution channels.  \nThese operating segments are components of the\nCompany about which financial information is  \nprepared and is evaluated regularly by        \nmanagement in deciding how to allocate        \nresources and assess performance. The Company \nhas five reportable operating segments:       \nCorporate and Commercial Banking Corporate and\nCommercial Banking offers lending, equipment  \nfinance and small-ticket leasing, depository  \nservices, treasury management, capital markets\nservices, international trade services and    \nother financial services to middle market,    \nlarge corporate, commercial real estate,      \nfinancial institution, non-profitand public   \nsector clients.                               \nConsumer and Business Banking Consumer and    \nBusiness Banking delivers products and        \nservices through banking offices, telephone   \nservicing and sales, on-lineservices, direct  \nmail, ATM processing and mobile devices. It   \nencompasses community banking, metropolitan   \nbanking and indirect lending, as well as      \nmortgage banking.                             \nWealth Management and Investment Services     \nWealth Management and Investment Services     \nprovides private banking, financial advisory  \nservices, investment management, retail       \nbrokerage services, insurance, trust, custody \nand fund servicing through four businesses:   \nWealth Management, Global Corporate Trust &   \nCustody, U.S. Bancorp Asset Management and    \nFund Services.                                \nPayment Services Payment Services includes    \nconsumer and business credit cards, stored-   \nvalue cards, debit cards, corporate,          \ngovernment and purchasing card services,      \nconsumer lines of credit and merchant         \nprocessing.                                   \nTreasury and Corporate Support Treasury and   \nCorporate Support includes the Company\u2019s      \ninvestment portfolios, funding, capital       \nmanagement, interest rate risk management,    \nincome taxes not allocated to business        \nsegments, including most investments in tax-  \nadvantagedprojects, and the residual aggregate\nof those expenses associated with corporate   \nactivities that are managed on a consolidated \nbasis.                                        \nBasis of Presentation Business segment results\nare derived from the Company\u2019s business unit  \nprofitability reporting systems by            \nspecifically attributing managed balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and    \ntheir related income or expense. The allowance\nfor credit losses and related provision       \nexpense are allocated to the business segments\naccording to the volume and credit quality of \nthe loan balances managed, but with the impact\nof changes in economic forecasts recorded in  \nTreasury and Corporate Support. Goodwill and  \nother intangible assets are assigned to the   \nbusiness segments based on the mix of business\nof an entity acquired by the Company. Within  \nthe Company, capital levels are evaluated and \nmanaged centrally; however, capital is        \nallocated to the business segments to support \nevaluation of business performance. Business  \nsegments are allocated capital on a risk-     \nadjusted basis considering economic and       \nregulatory capital requirements. Generally,   \nthe determination of the amount of capital    \nallocated to each business segment includes   \ncredit allocations following a Basel III      \nregulatory framework. Interest income and     \nexpense is determined based on the assets and \nliabilities managed by the business segment.  \nBecause funding and asset liability management\nis a central function, funds transfer-pricing \nmethodologies are utilized to allocate a cost \nof funds used or credit for funds provided to \nall business segment assets and liabilities,  \nrespectively, using a matched funding concept.\nAlso, each business unit is allocated the     \ntaxable-equivalent benefit of tax-            \nexemptproducts. The residual effect on net    \ninterest income of asset/ liability management\nactivities is included in Treasury and        \nCorporate Support.

Occupancy costs are allocated     \nbased on utilization of facilities by the     \nbusiness segments. Generally, operating losses\nare charged to the business segment when the  \nloss event is realized in a manner similar to \na loan charge-off.Noninterest expenses        \nincurred by centrally managed operations or   \nbusiness segments that directly support       \nanother business segment\u2019s operations are     \ncharged to the applicable business segment    \nbased on its utilization of those services,   \nprimarily measured by the volume of customer  \nactivities, number of employees or other      \nrelevant factors. These allocated expenses are\nreported as net shared services expense within\nnoninterest expense. Certain activities that  \ndo not directly support the operations of the \nbusiness segments or for which the business   \nsegments are not considered financially       \naccountable in evaluating their performance   \nare not charged to the business segments. The \nincome or expenses associated with these      \ncorporate activities is reported within the   \nTreasury and Corporate Support business       \nsegment. Income taxes are assessed to each    \nbusiness segment at a standard tax rate with  \nthe residual tax expense or benefit to arrive \nat the consolidated effective tax rate        \nincluded in Treasury and Corporate Support.   \nDesignations, assignments and allocations     \nchange from time to time as management systems\nare enhanced, methods of evaluating           \nperformance or product lines change or        \nbusiness segments are realigned to better     \nrespond to the Company\u2019s diverse customer     \nbase.
