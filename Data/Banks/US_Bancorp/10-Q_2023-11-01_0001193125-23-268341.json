\nsubsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) reported net     \nincome attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $1.5   \nbillion for the third quarter of 2023, or     \n$0.91 per diluted common share, compared with \n$1.8 billion, or $1.16 per diluted common     \nshare, for the third quarter of 2022. Return  \non average assets and return on average common\nequity were 0.91 percent and 11.9 percent,    \nrespectively, for the third quarter of 2023,  \ncompared with 1.22 percent and 15.8 percent,  \nrespectively, for the third quarter of 2022.  \nThe results for the third quarter of 2023     \nincluded the impact of $284 million of merger \nand integration-related charges associated    \nwith the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank, N.A. \n(\u201cMUB\u201d), which decreased diluted earnings per \ncommon share by $0.14. Total net revenue for  \nthe third quarter of 2023 was $706 million    \n(11.2 percent) higher than the third quarter  \nof 2022, reflecting a 10.7 percent increase in\nnet interest income and an 11.9 percent       \nincrease in noninterest income. The increase  \nin net interest income from the third quarter \nof 2022 was primarily due to the impacts of   \nrising interest rates on earning assets and   \nthe MUB acquisition. The increase in          \nnoninterest income reflected higher commercial\nproducts revenue, mortgage banking revenue,   \npayment services revenue and trust and        \ninvestment management fees. Noninterest       \nexpense in the third quarter of 2023 was $893 \nmillion (24.6 percent) higher than the third  \nquarter of 2022, reflecting merger and        \nintegration charges and operating expenses    \nrelated to the MUB acquisition, including core\ndeposit intangible amortization expense, as   \nwell as increases in compensation and employee\nbenefits expense to support business growth.  \nThe provision for credit losses for the third \nquarter of 2023 of $515 million was $153      \nmillion (42.3 percent) higher than the third  \nquarter of 2022, driven by normalizing credit \nlosses and commercial real estate credit      \nquality. Net charge-offs in the third quarter \nof 2023 were $420 million, compared with $162 \nmillion in the third quarter of 2022. Refer to\n\u201cCorporate Risk Profile\u201d for further          \ninformation on the provision for credit       \nlosses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets \nand other factors considered by the Company in\nassessing the credit quality of the loan      \nportfolio and establishing the allowance for  \ncredit losses. Net income attributable to U.S.\nBancorp for the first nine months of 2023 was \n$4.6 billion, or $2.79 per diluted common     \nshare, compared with $4.9 billion, or $3.13   \nper diluted common share, for the first nine  \nmonths of 2022. Return on average assets and  \nreturn on average common equity were 0.92     \npercent and 12.3 percent, respectively, for   \nthe first nine months of 2023, compared with  \n1.13 percent and 14.1 percent, respectively,  \nfor the first nine months of 2022. The results\nfor the first nine months of 2023 included the\nimpact of $838 million of merger and          \nintegration-related charges, $243 million of  \nprovision for credit losses and an additional \n$22 million of losses related to balance sheet\nrepositioning and capital management actions. \nCombined, these items decreased diluted       \nearnings per common share by $0.53. Total net \nrevenue for the first nine months of 2023 was \n$3.4 billion (19.2 percent) higher than the   \nfirst nine months of 2022, reflecting a 27.3  \npercent increase in net interest income (27.2 \npercent on a taxable-equivalent basis) and a  \n7.9 percent increase in noninterest income.   \nThe increase in net interest income from the  \nfirst nine months of 2022 was primarily due to\nthe impacts of rising interest rates on       \nearning assets and the MUB acquisition. The   \nincrease in noninterest income reflected      \nhigher commercial products revenue, trust and \ninvestment management fees and payment        \nservices revenue, partially offset by losses  \non securities. Noninterest expense in the     \nfirst nine months of 2023 was $2.8 billion    \n(25.7 percent) higher than the first nine     \nmonths of 2022, reflecting merger and         \nintegration charges and operating expenses    \nrelated to the MUB acquisition, including core\ndeposit intangible amortization expense, as   \nwell as increases in compensation and employee\nbenefits expense to support business growth.  \nThe provision for credit losses for the first \nnine months of 2023 of $1.8 billion was $978  \nmillion higher than the first nine months of  \n2022, driven by the impacts of balance sheet  \nrepositioning and capital management actions, \nnormalizing credit losses and increased       \neconomic uncertainty. Net charge-offs in the  \nfirst nine months of 2023 were $1.4 billion,  \ncompared with $485 million in the first nine  \nmonths of 2022.

MUFG Union Bank Acquisition On \nDecember 1, 2022, the Company acquired MUB\u2019s  \ncore regional banking franchise from          \nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (\u201cMUFG\u201d).\nPursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase   \nAgreement, the Company acquired all of the    \nissued and outstanding shares of common stock \nof MUB for a purchase price consisting of $5.5\nbillion in cash and approximately 44 million  \nshares of the Company\u2019s common stock. The     \nCompany also received additional MUB cash of  \n$3.5 billion upon completion of the           \nacquisition, which is required to be repaid to\nMUFG on or prior to the fifth anniversary date\nof the completion of the purchase. On August  \n3, 2023, the Company completed a debt/equity  \nconversion with MUFG. As a result, the Company\nrepaid $936 million of its debt obligation    \nfrom the proceeds of the issuance of 24       \nmillion shares of common stock of the Company \nto an affiliate of MUFG (the \u201cDebt/Equity     \nConversion\u201d). After the Debt/Equity           \nConversion, the Company had a remaining       \nrepayment obligation of $2.6 billion. On May  \n26, 2023, the Company merged MUB into U.S.    \nBank National Association (\u201cUSBNA\u201d), the      \nCompany\u2019s primary banking subsidiary. The     \nCompany\u2019s results for the third quarter and   \nfirst nine months of 2023 reflect the full    \nfinancial results of the acquired business.   \nSTATEMENT OF INCOME ANALYSIS Net Interest     \nIncome Net interest income, on a taxable-     \nequivalent basis, was $4.3 billion in the     \nthird quarter and $13.4 billion in the first  \nnine months of 2023, representing increases of\n$411 million (10.7 percent) and $2.9 billion  \n(27.2 percent), respectively, compared with   \nthe same periods of 2022. The increases were  \nprimarily due to the impact of rising interest\nrates on earning assets and the acquisition of\nMUB. Average earning assets for the third     \nquarter and first nine months of 2023 were    \n$63.6 billion (11.7 percent) and $72.8 billion\n(13.6 percent) higher, respectively, than the \nsame periods of 2022, reflecting increases in \nloans and interest-bearing deposits with      \nbanks, partially offset by a decrease in      \ninvestment securities. The net interest       \nmargin, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in the \nthird quarter and first nine months of 2023   \nwas 2.81 percent and 2.94 percent,            \nrespectively, compared with 2.83 percent and  \n2.62 percent in the third quarter and first   \nnine months of 2022, respectively. The        \ndecrease in net interest margin in the third  \nquarter of 2023, compared with the third      \nquarter of 2022, was primarily due to the     \nimpact of deposit mix and pricing, partially  \noffset by the impact of higher rates on       \nearning assets and the acquisition of MUB. The\nincrease in net interest margin in the first  \nnine months of 2023, compared with the same   \nperiod of the 2022, was primarily due to the  \nimpact of higher rates on earning assets and  \nthe acquisition of MUB, partially offset by   \nthe impact of deposit mix and pricing. Refer  \nto the \u201cConsolidated Daily Average Balance    \nSheet and Related Yields and Rates\u201d table for \nfurther information on net interest income.   \nAverage total loans in the third quarter and  \nfirst nine months of 2023 were $40.1 billion  \n(11.9 percent) and $59.4 billion (18.3        \npercent) higher, respectively, than the same  \nperiods of 2022. The increases were driven by \ngrowth in the Company\u2019s legacy loan portfolio \nas well as balances from the MUB acquisition. \nIncreases in residential mortgages, commercial\nreal estate loans, commercial loans and credit\ncard loans were partially offset by lower     \nother retail loans. The increase in           \nresidential mortgages was driven by the impact\nrelated to the MUB acquisition, along with on-\nbalancesheet loan activities and slower       \nrefinancing activity, partially offset by the \nimpact of a sale of residential mortgages in  \nthe second quarter of 2023 as part of balance \nsheet repositioning and capital management    \nactions. The increase in commercial loans was \nprimarily due to higher utilization driven by \nworking capital needs of corporate customers, \nslower payoffs given higher volatility in the \ncapital markets, as well as core growth and   \nthe impact related to the MUB acquisition. The\nincrease in commercial real estate loans was  \ndriven by the impact of the MUB acquisition,  \nwhile the increase in credit cards loans was  \nprimarily driven by higher spend volume and   \nlower payment rates. The decrease in other    \nretail loans was driven by lower auto loans   \nprimarily due to balance sheet repositioning  \nand capital management actions, along with    \nlower installment loans and lower retail      \nleasing balances, partially offset by higher  \nhome equity and second mortgages. Average     \ninvestment securities in the third quarter and\nfirst nine months of 2023 were $1.6 billion   \n(1.0 percent) and $7.2 billion (4.2 percent)  \nlower, respectively, than the same periods of \n2022, driven by balance sheet repositioning   \nand liquidity management in connection with   \nthe acquisition of MUB. The decrease from the \nprior year reflected sales of investment      \nsecurities, partially offset by the impact of \nacquired MUB investment securities. Average   \ntotal deposits for the third quarter and first\nnine months of 2023 were $55.5 billion (12.2  \npercent) and $50.8 billion (11.1 percent)     \nhigher, respectively, than the same periods of\n2022.

Average time   \ndeposits for the third quarter and first nine \nmonths of 2023 were $18.5 billion (51.2       \npercent) and $15.4 billion (52.6 percent)     \nhigher, respectively, than the same periods of\nthe prior year, mainly due to the acquisition \nof MUB and increases in Consumer and Business \nBanking balances, partially offset by         \ndecreases in Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and\nInstitutional Banking balances. Changes in    \ntime deposits are primarily related to those  \ndeposits managed as an alternative to other   \nfunding sources, based largely on relative    \npricing and liquidity characteristics. Average\nnoninterest-bearing deposits for the third    \nquarter and first nine months of 2023 were    \n$16.5 billion (14.5 percent) and $7.3 billion \n(6.1 percent) lower, respectively, than the   \nsame periods of 2022, driven by decreases in  \nWealth, Corporate, Commercial and             \nInstitutional Banking balances, partially     \noffset by the impact of the MUB acquisition.  \nAverage noninterest-bearing deposits further  \ndecreased in the third quarter of 2023,       \ncompared with the third quarter of 2022, due  \nto decreases in Consumer and Business Banking \nbalances. Provision for Credit Losses The     \nprovision for credit losses was $515 million  \nin the third quarter and $1.8 billion in the  \nfirst nine months of 2023, representing       \nincreases of $153 million (42.3 percent) and  \n$978 million, respectively, from the same     \nperiods of 2022. The increases were driven by \nnormalizing credit losses, commercial real    \nestate credit quality and increased economic  \nuncertainty. The provision for credit losses  \nfurther increased in the first nine months of \n2023, compared with the same period of the    \nprior year, due to the impact of balance sheet\nrepositioning and capital management actions  \ntaken in the second quarter of 2023. Net      \ncharge-offs increased $258 million in the     \nthird quarter and $957 million in the first   \nnine months of 2023, compared with the same   \nperiods of 2022, reflecting higher charge-offs\nin most loan categories consistent with       \nnormalizing credit conditions and adverse     \nconditions in commercial real estate. In      \naddition, net charge-offs were higher in the  \nfirst nine months of 2023, compared with the  \nfirst nine months of the prior year, due to   \ncharge-offs related to balance sheet          \nrepositioning and capital management actions, \nalong with charge-offs in the first quarter of\n2023 related to the uncollectible amount of   \nacquired loans, which were considered         \npurchased credit deteriorated as of the date  \nof the MUB acquisition.

The   \nincreases over the prior year reflected       \nstronger commercial products revenue, trust   \nand investment management fees, payment       \nservices revenue and other noninterest income.\nThe increase in noninterest income in the     \nfirst nine months of 2023, compared with the  \nsame period of the prior year, was partially  \noffset by losses on the sale of securities.   \nCommercial products revenue increased         \nprimarily due to higher trading revenue,      \ncommercial loan fees, corporate bond fees and \nthe acquisition of MUB. Trust and investment  \nmanagement fees increased primarily due to the\nacquisition of MUB and core business growth.  \nPayment services revenue increased due to     \nhigher card revenue driven by higher spend    \nvolume and favorable rates, and increased     \nmerchant processing                           \n                     \n  6    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                     \nTable of Contents\n                                  \n  Table\u20093    Noninterest Expense  \n                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                     \n  *  Not meaningful  \n                     \n                                              \n  (a)  SeeNon-GAAPFinancial Measures          \n       beginning on page 32.                  \n                                              \nservices revenue and corporate payment        \nproducts revenue due to higher spend volume.  \nNoninterest income further increased in the   \nthird quarter of 2023, compared with the third\nquarter of 2022, mainly due to higher mortgage\nbanking revenue driven by higher gain on sale \nmargins and increases in mortgage servicing   \nrights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) valuations, net of hedging    \nactivities. Noninterest Expense Noninterest   \nexpense was $4.5 billion in the third quarter \nand $13.7 billion in the first nine months of \n2023, representing increases of $893 million  \n(24.6 percent) and $2.8 billion (25.7         \npercent), respectively, over the same periods \nof 2022. The increases from the prior year    \nreflected the impact of merger and integration\ncharges, as well as operating expenses related\nto the MUB acquisition, higher compensation   \nand employee benefits expense and higher other\nintangibles expense. Compensation and employee\nbenefits expense increased primarily due to   \nMUB expense as well as merit increases and    \nhiring to support business growth. Other      \nintangibles expense increased primarily due to\nthe core deposit intangible created as a      \nresult of the MUB acquisition. On May 11,     \n2023, the FDIC released a proposed rule that  \nwould impose special assessments to recover   \nthe losses to the deposit insurance fund      \nresulting from the recent failures of other   \nbanking institutions. The Company expects the \nspecial assessments would be tax deductible.  \nAlthough the proposal could change and the    \ntiming of accounting recognition is still     \nunder consideration, if the final rule is     \nissued as proposed, the Company estimates it  \nwould recognize additional noninterest expense\nof approximately $650 million ($500 million   \nnet-of-tax),representing a potential 10 basis \npoint reduction in the Company\u2019s common equity\ntier 1 capital ratio, upon finalization of the\nrule. Income Tax Expense The provision for    \nincome taxes was $431 million (an effective   \nrate of 22.0 percent) for the third quarter   \nand $1.3 billion (an effective rate of 21.6   \npercent) for the first nine months of 2023,   \ncompared with $481 million (an effective rate \nof 20.9 percent) and $1.3 billion (an         \neffective rate of 20.8 percent) for the same  \nperiods of 2022, respectively.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS Loans The  \nCompany\u2019s loan portfolio was $375.2 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2023, compared with $388.2      \nbillion at December 31, 2022, a decrease of   \n$13.0 billion (3.3 percent). The decrease was \ndriven by lower other retail loans, commercial\nloans, commercial real estate loans and       \nresidential mortgages, partially offset by    \nhigher credit card loans. Other retail loans  \ndecreased $9.2 billion (16.8 percent) at      \nSeptember 30, 2023, compared with December 31,\n2022, primarily due to decreases in auto loans\nand retail leasing balances. The decrease in  \nauto loans was primarily driven by a sale of  \nindirect auto loans as part of balance sheet  \nrepositioning and capital management actions  \ntaken in the second quarter of 2023.          \nCommercial loans decreased $2.4 billion (1.7  \npercent) at September 30, 2023, compared with \nDecember 31, 2022, primarily due to decreased \ndemand as corporate customers accessed the    \ncapital markets. Commercial real estate loans \ndecreased $1.4 billion (2.4 percent) at       \nSeptember 30, 2023, compared with December 31,\n2022, primarily due to payoffs exceeding a    \nreduced level of new originations. Residential\nmortgages held in the loan portfolio decreased\n$790 million (0.7 percent) at September 30,   \n2023, compared with December 31, 2022, driven \nby a sale of residential mortgages in the     \nsecond quarter of 2023 as part of balance     \nsheet repositioning and capital management    \nactions, partially offset by originations.    \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    7  \n                     \nTable of Contents\nResidential mortgages originated and placed in\nthe Company\u2019s loan portfolio include jumbo    \nmortgages and branch-originated first lien    \nhome equity loans to borrowers with high      \ncredit quality. Credit card loans increased   \n$785 million (3.0 percent) at September 30,   \n2023, compared with December 31, 2022,        \nprimarily driven by higher spend volume and   \nlower payment rates. The Company generally    \nretains portfolio loans through maturity;     \nhowever, the Company\u2019s intent may change over \ntime based upon various factors such as       \nongoing asset/liability management activities,\nassessment of product profitability, credit   \nrisk, liquidity needs, and capital            \nimplications. If the Company\u2019s intent or      \nability to hold an existing portfolio loan    \nchanges, it is transferred to loans held for  \nsale. Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale,\nconsisting primarily of residential mortgages \nto be sold in the secondary market, were $2.3 \nbillion at September 30, 2023, compared with  \n$2.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The        \nincrease in loans held for sale was           \nprincipally due to a higher level of mortgage \nloan closings in the third quarter of 2023,   \ncompared with the fourth quarter of 2022.     \nAlmost all of the residential mortgage loans  \nthe Company originates or purchases for sale  \nfollow guidelines that allow the loans to be  \nsold into existing, highly liquid secondary   \nmarkets, in particular in government agency   \ntransactions and to government-sponsored      \nenterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d). Investment Securities   \nInvestment securities totaled $152.5 billion  \nat September 30, 2023, compared with $161.7   \nbillion at December 31, 2022. The $9.1 billion\n(5.6 percent) decrease was primarily due to   \n$7.9 billion of net investment sales and      \nmaturities along with a $1.0 billion          \nunfavorable change in net unrealized gains    \n(losses) on available-for-saleinvestment      \nsecurities. The Company\u2019s available-for-      \nsaleinvestment securities are carried at fair \nvalue with changes in fair value reflected in \nother comprehensive income (loss) unless a    \nportion of a security\u2019s unrealized loss is    \nrelated to credit and an allowance for credit \nlosses is necessary. At September 30, 2023,   \nthe Company\u2019s net unrealized losses on        \navailable-for-saleinvestment securities were  \n$9.5 billion ($7.1 billion net-of-            \ntax),compared with $8.5 billion ($6.4 billion \nnet-of-tax)at December 31, 2022. The          \nunfavorable change in net unrealized gains    \n(losses) was primarily due to decreases in the\nfair value of mortgage-backed and state and   \npolitical securities as a result of changes in\ninterest rates. Gross unrealized losses on    \navailable-for-saleinvestment securities       \ntotaled $9.6 billion at September 30, 2023,   \ncompared with $8.6 billion at December 31,    \n2022. When evaluating credit losses, the      \nCompany considers various factors such as the \nnature of the investment security, the credit \nratings or financial condition of the issuer, \nthe extent of the unrealized loss, expected   \ncash flows of the underlying collateral, the  \nexistence of any government or agency         \nguarantees, and market conditions. At         \nSeptember 30, 2023, the Company had no plans  \nto sell securities with unrealized losses, and\nbelieved it is more likely than not that it   \nwould not be required to sell such securities \nbefore recovery of their amortized cost.      \n                                    \n  Table\u20094    Investment Securities  \n                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Information related to asset and       \n       mortgage-backed securities included    \n  (a)  above is presented based upon          \n       weighted-average maturities that take  \n       into account anticipated future        \n       prepayments.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Information related to obligations of  \n       state and political subdivisions is    \n       presented based upon yield to first    \n  (b)  optional call date if the security is  \n       purchased at a premium, and yield to   \n       maturity if the security is purchased  \n       at par or a discount.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Maturity calculations for obligations  \n       of state and political subdivisions    \n       are based on the first optional call   \n  (c)  date for securities with a fair value  \n       above par and the contractual          \n       maturity date for securities with a    \n       fair value equal to or below par.      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Amortized cost excludes portfolio      \n  (d)  level basis adjustments of $(95)\u00a0      \n       million at September\u00a030, 2023.         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Weighted-average yields for            \n       obligations of state and political     \n       subdivisions are presented on a        \n       fully-taxable equivalent basis based   \n       on a federal income tax rate of 21\u00a0    \n  (e)  percent.

Deposits\nTotal deposits were $518.4 billion at         \nSeptember 30, 2023, compared with $525.0      \nbillion at December 31, 2022. The $6.6 billion\n(1.3 percent) decrease in total deposits      \nreflected a decrease in noninterest-bearing   \ndeposits, partially offset by increases in    \ntime deposits and total savings deposits.     \nNoninterest-bearing deposits decreased $39.7  \nbillion (28.8 percent) at September 30, 2023, \ncompared with December 31, 2022, primarily due\nto lower Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and    \nInstitutional Banking, and Consumer and       \nBusiness Banking balances. The decrease in    \nnoninterest-bearing deposits was driven by a  \nproduct change for certain MUB retail checking\naccounts into interest checking accounts at   \nconversion to create a better customer        \nexperience, as well as pricing pressures from \nrising interest rates. Time deposits increased\n$20.6 billion (62.5 percent) at September 30, \n2023, compared with December 31, 2022, driven \nby higher Consumer and Business Banking       \nbalances, partially offset by lower Wealth,   \nCorporate, Commercial and Institutional       \nBanking balances. Changes in time deposits are\nprimarily related to those deposits managed as\nan alternative to other funding sources, based\nlargely on relative pricing and liquidity     \ncharacteristics. Money market deposit balances\nincreased $41.7 billion (28.2 percent),       \nprimarily due to higher Consumer and Business \nBanking, and Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and\nInstitutional Banking balances. Savings       \naccount balances decreased $24.7 billion (34.4\npercent), driven by lower Consumer and        \nBusiness Banking, and Wealth, Corporate,      \nCommercial and Institutional Banking balances.\nInterest checking balances decreased $4.5     \nbillion (3.4 percent), primarily due to lower \nWealth, Corporate, Commercial and             \nInstitutional Banking balances. Borrowings The\nCompany utilizes both short-term and long-term\nborrowings as part of its asset/liability     \nmanagement and funding strategies. Short-term \nborrowings, which include federal funds       \npurchased, commercial paper, repurchase       \nagreements, borrowings secured by high-grade  \nassets and other short-term borrowings, were  \n$21.9 billion at September 30, 2023, compared \nwith $31.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The  \n$9.3 billion (29.8 percent) decrease in short-\nterm borrowings was primarily due to decreases\nin short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) \nadvances. Long-term debt was $43.1 billion at \nSeptember 30, 2023, compared with $39.8       \nbillion at December 31, 2022. The $3.2 billion\n(8.1 percent) increase was primarily due to   \n$7.2 billion of medium-term note issuances,   \npartially offset by $2.8 billion of bank note \nrepayments and maturities and a $936 million  \nrepayment of the Company\u2019s debt obligation to \nMUFG. Refer to the \u201cLiquidity Risk Management\u201d\nsection for discussion of liquidity management\nof the Company. CORPORATE RISK PROFILE        \nOverview Managing risks is an essential part  \nof successfully operating a financial services\ncompany. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors has \napproved a risk management framework which    \nestablishes governance and risk management    \nrequirements for all risk-taking activities.  \nThis framework includes Company and business  \nline risk appetite statements which set       \nboundaries for the types and amount of risk   \nthat may be undertaken in pursuing business   \nobjectives and initiatives. The Board of      \nDirectors, primarily through its Risk         \nManagement Committee, oversees performance    \nrelative to the risk management framework,    \nrisk appetite statements, and other policy    \nrequirements. The Executive Risk Committee    \n(\u201cERC\u201d), which is chaired by the Chief Risk   \nOfficer and includes the Chief Executive      \nOfficer and other members of the executive    \nmanagement team, oversees execution against   \nthe risk management framework and risk        \nappetite statements. The ERC focuses on       \ncurrent and emerging risks, including         \nstrategic and reputation risks, by directing  \ntimely and comprehensive actions. Senior      \noperating committees have also been           \nestablished, each responsible for overseeing a\nspecified category of risk. Upon closing of   \nthe MUB acquisition, the Company\u2019s risk       \nmanagement framework applied to the legal     \nentities acquired from MUFG, including MUB, up\nuntil its merger into USBNA. Updates were made\nto align the acquired entities with the       \nCompany\u2019s risk appetite and connect the       \nelements of their respective risk governance  \nand reporting into the Company\u2019s existing risk\nmanagement framework. Upon completing the     \nmerger of MUB into USBNA, which occurred on   \nMay 26, 2023, the MUB risk governance and     \nreporting framework is no longer applicable.  \nThe Company\u2019s most prominent risk exposures   \nare credit, interest rate, market, liquidity, \noperational, compliance, strategic, and       \nreputation. Credit risk is the risk of loss   \nassociated with a change in the credit profile\nor the failure of a borrower or counterparty  \nto meet its contractual obligations. Interest \nrate risk is the current or prospective risk  \nto earnings and capital, or market valuations,\narising from the impact of changes in interest\nrates. Market risk arises from fluctuations in\ninterest rates, foreign exchange rates, and   \nsecurity prices that may result in changes in \nthe values of financial                       \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    9  \n                     \nTable of Contents\ninstruments, such as trading and available-   \nfor-salesecurities, mortgage loans held for   \nsale (\u201cMLHFS\u201d), MSRs and derivatives that are \naccounted for on a fair value basis. Liquidity\nrisk is the risk that financial condition or  \noverall safety and soundness is adversely     \naffected by the Company\u2019s inability, or       \nperceived inability, to meet its cash flow    \nobligations in a timely and complete manner in\neither normal or stressed conditions.         \nOperational risk is the risk to current or    \nprojected financial condition and resilience  \narising from inadequate or failed internal    \nprocesses or systems, people (including human \nerrors or misconduct), or adverse external    \nevents, including the risk of loss resulting  \nfrom breaches in data security. Operational   \nrisk can also include the risk of loss due to \nfailures by third parties with which the      \nCompany does business. Compliance risk is the \nrisk that the Company may suffer legal or     \nregulatory sanctions, financial losses, and   \nreputational damage if it fails to adhere to  \ncompliance requirements and the Company\u2019s     \ncompliance policies. Strategic risk is the    \nrisk to current or projected financial        \ncondition and resilience arising from adverse \nbusiness decisions, poor implementation of    \nbusiness decisions, or lack of responsiveness \nto changes in the banking industry and        \noperating environment. Reputation risk is the \nrisk to current or anticipated earnings,      \ncapital, or franchise or enterprise value     \narising from negative public opinion. This    \nrisk may impair the Company\u2019s competitiveness \nby affecting its ability to establish new     \nrelationships or services, or continue serving\nexisting relationships. In addition to the    \nrisks identified above, other risk factors    \nexist that may impact the Company. Refer to   \n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report \non Form 10-Kfor the year ended December 31,   \n2022, for a detailed discussion of these      \nfactors. The Company\u2019s Board and management-  \nlevel governance committees are supported by a\n\u201cthree lines of defense\u201d model for            \nestablishing effective checks and balances.   \nThe first line of defense, the business lines,\nmanages risks in conformity with established  \nlimits and policy requirements. In turn,      \nbusiness line leaders and their risk officers \nestablish programs to ensure conformity with  \nthese limits and policy requirements. The     \nsecond line of defense, which includes the    \nChief Risk Officer\u2019s organization as well as  \npolicy and oversight activities of corporate  \nsupport functions, translates risk appetite   \nand strategy into actionable risk limits and  \npolicies. The second line of defense monitors \nfirst line of defense conformity with limits  \nand policies and provides reporting and       \nescalation of emerging risks and other        \nconcerns to senior management and the Risk    \nManagement Committee of the Board of          \nDirectors. The third line of defense, internal\naudit, is responsible for providing the Audit \nCommittee of the Board of Directors and senior\nmanagement with independent assessment and    \nassurance regarding the effectiveness of the  \nCompany\u2019s governance, risk management and     \ncontrol processes. Management regularly       \nprovides reports to the Risk Management       \nCommittee of the Board of Directors. The Risk \nManagement Committee discusses with management\nthe Company\u2019s risk management performance and \nprovides a summary of key risks to the entire \nBoard of Directors, covering the status of    \nexisting matters, areas of potential future   \nconcern and specific information on certain   \ntypes of loss events. The Risk Management     \nCommittee considers quarterly reports by      \nmanagement assessing the Company\u2019s performance\nrelative to the risk appetite statements and  \nthe associated risk limits, including:        \n                                              \n       Macroeconomic environment and other    \n       qualitative considerations, such as    \n  \u2022    regulatory and compliance changes,     \n       litigation developments, geopolitical  \n       events, and technology and             \n       cybersecurity;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit measures, including adversely   \n  \u2022    rated and nonperforming loans,         \n       leveraged transactions, credit         \n       concentrations and lending limits;     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Interest rate and market risk,         \n  \u2022    including market value and net income  \n       simulation, and trading-related Value  \n       at Risk (\u201cVaR\u201d);                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Liquidity risk, including funding      \n  \u2022    projections under various stressed     \n       scenarios;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       Operational and compliance risk,       \n       including losses stemming from events  \n       such as fraud, processing errors,      \n       control breaches, breaches in data     \n  \u2022    security or adverse business           \n       decisions, as well as reporting on     \n       technology performance, and various    \n       legal and regulatory compliance        \n       measures;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Capital ratios and projections,        \n  \u2022    including regulatory measures and      \n       stressed scenarios; and                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Strategic and reputation risk          \n  \u2022    considerations, impacts and            \n       responses.                             \n                                              \nCredit Risk Management The Company\u2019s strategy \nfor credit risk management includes well-     \ndefined, centralized credit policies, uniform \nunderwriting criteria, and ongoing risk       \nmonitoring and review processes for all       \ncommercial and consumer credit exposures. The \nstrategy also emphasizes diversification on a \ngeographic, industry and customer level,      \nregular credit examinations and management    \nreviews of loans exhibiting deterioration of  \ncredit quality. In evaluating its credit risk,\nthe Company considers changes, if any, in     \nunderwriting activities, the loan portfolio   \ncomposition (including product mix and        \ngeographic, industry or customer-specific     \nconcentrations), collateral values, trends in \nloan performance and macroeconomic factors,   \nsuch as changes in unemployment rates, gross  \ndomestic product                              \n                      \n  10    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nlevels, inflation, interest rates and consumer\nbankruptcy filings. The Risk Management       \nCommittee oversees the Company\u2019s credit risk  \nmanagement process. In addition, credit       \nquality ratings, as defined by the Company,   \nare an important part of the Company\u2019s overall\ncredit risk management and evaluation of its  \nallowance for credit losses. Loans with a pass\nrating represent those loans not classified on\nthe Company\u2019s rating scale for problem        \ncredits, as minimal credit risk has been      \nidentified. Loans with a special mention or   \nclassified rating, including consumer lending \nand small business loans that are 90 days or  \nmore past due and still accruing, nonaccrual  \nloans and loans in a junior lien position that\nare current but are behind a first lien       \nposition on nonaccrual, encompass all loans   \nheld by the Company that it considers to have \na potential or well-defined weakness that may \nput full collection of contractual cash flows \nat risk. The Company\u2019s internal credit quality\nratings for consumer loans are primarily based\non delinquency and nonperforming status,      \nexcept for a limited population of larger     \nloans within those portfolios that are        \nindividually evaluated. For this limited      \npopulation, the determination of the internal \ncredit quality rating may also consider       \ncollateral value and customer cash flows.     \nRefer to Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated  \nFinancial Statements for further discussion of\nthe Company\u2019s loan portfolios including       \ninternal credit quality ratings. In addition, \nrefer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u2014 Credit Risk Management\u201d in the Company\u2019s    \nAnnual Report on Form 10-Kfor the year ended  \nDecember 31, 2022, for a more detailed        \ndiscussion on credit risk management          \nprocesses. The Company manages its credit     \nrisk, in part, through diversification of its \nloan portfolio which is achieved through limit\nsetting by product type criteria, such as     \nindustry, and identification of credit        \nconcentrations. The Company categorizes its   \nloan portfolio into two segments, which is the\nlevel at which it develops and documents a    \nsystematic methodology to determine the       \nallowance for credit losses. The Company\u2019s two\nloan portfolio segments are commercial lending\nand consumer lending. The commercial lending  \nsegment includes loans and leases made to     \nsmall business, middle market, large          \ncorporate, commercial real estate, financial  \ninstitution, non-profitand public sector      \ncustomers. Key risk characteristics relevant  \nto commercial lending segment loans include   \nthe industry and geography of the borrower\u2019s  \nbusiness, purpose of the loan, repayment      \nsource, borrower\u2019s debt capacity and financial\nflexibility, loan covenants, and nature of    \npledged collateral, if any, as well as        \nmacroeconomic factors such as unemployment    \nrates, gross domestic product levels,         \ncorporate bond spreads and long-term interest \nrates. These risk characteristics, among      \nothers, are considered in determining         \nestimates about the likelihood of default by  \nthe borrowers and the severity of loss in the \nevent of default. The Company considers these \nrisk characteristics in assigning internal    \nrisk ratings to, or forecasting losses on,    \nthese loans, which are the significant factors\nin determining the allowance for credit losses\nfor loans in the commercial lending segment.  \nThe consumer lending segment represents loans \nand leases made to consumer customers,        \nincluding residential mortgages, credit card  \nloans, and other retail loans such as         \nrevolving consumer lines, auto loans and      \nleases, home equity loans and lines, and      \nstudent loans, a run-offportfolio. Home equity\nor second mortgage loans are junior lien      \nclosed-endaccounts fully disbursed at         \norigination. These loans typically are fixed  \nrate loans, secured by residential real       \nestate, with a 10-or 15-yearfixed payment     \namortization schedule. Home equity lines are  \nrevolving accounts giving the borrower the    \nability to draw and repay balances repeatedly,\nup to a maximum commitment, and are secured by\nresidential real estate. These include        \naccounts in either a first or junior lien     \nposition. Typical terms on home equity lines  \nin the portfolio are variable rates           \nbenchmarked to the prime rate, with a         \n10-yeardraw period during which a minimum     \npayment is equivalent to the monthly interest,\nfollowed by a 20-yearamortization period,     \nrespectively. At September 30, 2023,          \nsubstantially all of the Company\u2019s home equity\nlines were in the draw period. Key risk       \ncharacteristics relevant to consumer lending  \nsegment loans primarily relate to the         \nborrowers\u2019 capacity and willingness to repay  \nand include unemployment rates, consumer      \nbankruptcy filings and other macroeconomic    \nfactors, customer payment history and credit  \nscores, and in some cases, updated loan-to-   \nvalue(\u201cLTV\u201d) information reflecting current   \nmarket conditions on real estate-based loans. \nThese and other risk characteristics are      \nreflected in forecasts of delinquency levels, \nbankruptcies and losses which are the primary \nfactors in determining the allowance for      \ncredit losses for the consumer lending        \nsegment. The Company further disaggregates its\nloan portfolio segments into various classes  \nbased on their underlying risk                \ncharacteristics. The two classes within the   \ncommercial lending segment are commercial     \nloans and commercial real estate loans. The   \nthree classes within the consumer lending     \nsegment are residential mortgages, credit card\nloans and other retail loans. The Company\u2019s   \nconsumer lending segment utilizes several     \ndistinct business processes and channels to   \noriginate consumer credit, including          \ntraditional branch                            \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    11  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nlending, mobile and on-linebanking, indirect  \nlending, alliance partnerships and            \ncorrespondent banks. Each distinct            \nunderwriting and origination activity manages \nunique credit risk characteristics and prices \nits loan production commensurate with the     \ndiffering risk profiles. Residential mortgage \noriginations are generally limited to prime   \nborrowers and are performed through the       \nCompany\u2019s branches, loan production offices,  \nmobile and on-lineservices, and a wholesale   \nnetwork of originators. The Company may retain\nresidential mortgage loans it originates on   \nits balance sheet or sell the loans into the  \nsecondary market while retaining the servicing\nrights and customer relationships. Utilizing  \nthe secondary markets enables the Company to  \neffectively reduce its credit and other       \nasset/liability risks. For residential        \nmortgages that are retained in the Company\u2019s  \nportfolio and for home equity and second      \nmortgages, credit risk is managed by adherence\nto LTV and borrower credit criteria during the\nunderwriting process. The Company estimates   \nupdated LTV information on its outstanding    \nresidential mortgages quarterly, based on a   \nmethod that combines automated valuation model\nupdates and relevant home price indices. LTV  \nis the ratio of the loan\u2019s outstanding        \nprincipal balance to the current estimate of  \nproperty value. For home equity and second    \nmortgages, combined loan-to-value(\u201cCLTV\u201d) is  \nthe combination of the first mortgage original\nprincipal balance and the second lien         \noutstanding principal balance, relative to the\ncurrent estimate of property value. Certain   \nloans do not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily   \ndue to lack of availability of relevant       \nautomated valuation model and/or home price   \nindices values, or lack of necessary valuation\ndata on acquired loans. The following tables  \nprovide summary information of residential    \nmortgages and home equity and second mortgages\nby LTV at September 30, 2023:                 \n

\ndifficulties in the near-term. In most cases  \nthe modification is either a concessionary    \nreduction in interest rate, extension of the  \nmaturity date or reduction in the principal   \nbalance that would otherwise not be           \nconsidered. Modified loans accrue interest if \nthe borrower complies with the revised terms  \nand conditions and has demonstrated repayment \nperformance at a level commensurate with the  \nmodified terms over several payment cycles,   \nwhich is generally six months or greater. The \nCompany continues to work with customers to   \nmodify loans for borrowers who are            \nexperiencing financial difficulties. Many of  \nthe Company\u2019s loan modifications are          \ndetermined on a case-by-casebasis in          \nconnection with ongoing loan collection       \nprocesses. The modifications vary within each \nof the Company\u2019s loan classes. Commercial     \nlending segment modifications generally       \ninclude extensions of the maturity date and   \nmay be accompanied by an increase or decrease \nto the interest rate. The Company may also    \nwork with the borrower to make other changes  \nto the loan to mitigate losses, such as       \nobtaining additional collateral and/or        \nguarantees to support the loan. The Company   \nhas also implemented certain residential      \nmortgage loan modification programs. The      \nCompany modifies residential mortgage loans   \nunder Federal Housing Administration, United  \nStates Department of Veterans Affairs, and its\nown internal programs. Under these programs,  \nthe Company offers qualifying homeowners the  \nopportunity to permanently modify their loan  \nand achieve more affordable monthly payments. \nThese modifications may include adjustments to\ninterest rates, conversion of adjustable rates\nto fixed rates, extensions of maturity dates  \nor deferrals of payments, capitalization of   \naccrued interest and/or outstanding advances, \nor in limited situations, partial forgiveness \nof loan principal. In most instances,         \nparticipation in residential mortgage loan    \nmodification programs requires the customer to\ncomplete a short-term trial period. A         \npermanent loan modification is contingent on  \nthe customer successfully completing the trial\nperiod arrangement, and the loan documents are\nnot modified until that time.                 \n                      \n  14    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCredit card and other retail loan             \nmodifications are generally part of distinct  \nmodification programs providing customers     \nmodification solutions over a specified time  \nperiod, generally up to 60 months. The Company\nalso makes short-term modifications, in       \nlimited circumstances, to assist borrowers    \nexperiencing temporary hardships, including   \npreviously offering payment relief to         \nborrowers that experienced financial hardship \nresulting directly from the effects of the    \nCOVID-19pandemic. Short-term consumer lending \nmodification programs include payment         \nreductions, deferrals of up to three past due \npayments, and the ability to return to current\nstatus if the borrower makes required         \npayments. The Company may also make short-term\nmodifications to commercial lending loans,    \nwith the most common modification being an    \nextension of the maturity date of three months\nor less. Such extensions generally are used   \nwhen the maturity date is imminent and the    \nborrower is experiencing some level of        \nfinancial stress, but the Company believes the\nborrower will pay all contractual amounts     \nowed. Nonperforming Assets The level of       \nnonperforming assets represents another       \nindicator of the potential for future credit  \nlosses. Nonperforming assets include          \nnonaccrual loans, modified loans not          \nperforming in accordance with modified terms  \nand not accruing interest, modified loans that\nhave not met the performance period required  \nto return to accrual status, other real estate\nowned (\u201cOREO\u201d) and other nonperforming assets \nowned by the Company. Interest payments       \ncollected from assets on nonaccrual status are\ngenerally applied against the principal       \nbalance and not recorded as income. However,  \ninterest income may be recognized for interest\npayments if the remaining carrying amount of  \nthe loan is believed to be collectible. At    \nSeptember 30, 2023, total nonperforming assets\nwere $1.3 billion, compared to $1.0 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022. The $294 million (28.9     \npercent) increase in nonperforming assets was \nprimarily due to higher nonperforming         \ncommercial real estate and commercial loans,  \npartially offset by a decrease in             \nnonperforming residential mortgages. The ratio\nof total nonperforming assets to total loans  \nand other real estate was 0.35 percent at     \nSeptember 30, 2023, compared with 0.26 percent\nat December 31, 2022. OREO was $25 million at \nSeptember 30, 2023, compared with $23 million \nat December 31, 2022, and was related to      \nforeclosed properties that previously secured \nloan balances. These balances exclude         \nforeclosed GNMA loans whose repayments are    \nprimarily insured by the Federal Housing      \nAdministration or guaranteed by the United    \nStates Department of Veterans Affairs.        \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    15  \n                      \nTable of Contents\n                                       \n  Table\u20096    Nonperforming

Charge-offs Total loan   \nnet charge-offs were $420 million for the     \nthird quarter and $1.4 billion for the first  \nnine months of 2023, compared with $162       \nmillion and $485 million, respectively, for   \nthe same periods of 2022. The year-over-year  \nincreases in net charge-offs reflected higher \ncharge-offs in most loan categories consistent\nwith normalizing credit conditions and adverse\nconditions in commercial real estate. In      \naddition, net charge-offs were higher in the  \nfirst nine months of 2023, compared with the  \nfirst nine months of the prior year, due to   \ncharge-offs related to balance sheet          \nrepositioning and capital management actions  \ntaken in the second quarter of 2023, along    \nwith charge-offs in the first quarter of 2023 \nrelated to the uncollectible amount of        \nacquired loans, which were considered         \npurchased credit deteriorated as of the date  \nof the MUB acquisition. The ratio of total    \nloan net charge-offs to average loans         \noutstanding on an annualized basis for the    \nthird quarter and first nine months of 2023   \nwas 0.44 percent and 0.50 percent,            \nrespectively, compared with 0.19 percent and  \n0.20 percent, respectively, for the same      \nperiods of 2022. Excluding the impact of      \ncharge-offs related to the MUB acquisition and\nbalance sheet repositioning and capital       \nmanagement actions, the ratio of total loan   \nnet charge-offs to average loans outstanding  \non an annualized basis for the first nine     \nmonths of 2023 was 0.36percent (see Non-      \nGAAPFinancial Measures beginning on page 32). \nAnalysis and Determination of the Allowance   \nfor Credit Losses The allowance for credit    \nlosses is established for current expected    \ncredit losses on the Company\u2019s loan and       \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    17  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nlease portfolio, including unfunded credit    \ncommitments. The allowance considers expected \nlosses for the remaining lives of the         \napplicable assets, inclusive of expected      \nrecoveries. The allowance for credit losses is\nincreased through provisions charged to       \nearnings and reduced by net charge-offs.      \nManagement evaluates the appropriateness of   \nthe allowance for credit losses on a quarterly\nbasis. Multiple economic scenarios are        \nconsidered over a three-year reasonable and   \nsupportable forecast period, which includes   \nincreasing consideration of historical loss   \nexperience over years two and three. These    \neconomic scenarios are constructed with       \ninterrelated projections of multiple economic \nvariables, and loss estimates are produced    \nthat consider the historical correlation of   \nthose economic variables with credit losses.  \nAfter the forecast period, the Company fully  \nreverts to long-term historical loss          \nexperience, adjusted for prepayments and      \ncharacteristics of the current loan and lease \nportfolio, to estimate losses over the        \nremaining life of the portfolio. The economic \nscenarios are updated at least quarterly and  \nare designed to provide a range of reasonable \nestimates from better to worse than current   \nexpectations. Scenarios are weighted based on \nthe Company\u2019s expectation of economic         \nconditions for the foreseeable future and     \nreflect significant judgment and consideration\nof economic forecast uncertainty. Final loss  \nestimates also consider factors affecting     \ncredit losses not reflected in the scenarios, \ndue to the unique aspects of current          \nconditions and expectations. These factors may\ninclude, but are not limited to, loan         \nservicing practices, regulatory guidance,     \nand/or fiscal and monetary policy actions.    \nBecause business processes and credit risks   \nassociated with unfunded credit commitments   \nare essentially the same as for loans, the    \nCompany utilizes similar processes to estimate\nits liability for unfunded credit commitments,\nwhich is included in other liabilities in the \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Both the allowance\nfor loan losses and the liability for unfunded\ncredit commitments are included in the        \nCompany\u2019s analysis of credit losses and       \nreported reserve ratios. The allowance        \nrecorded for credit losses utilizes forward-  \nlooking expected loss models to consider a    \nvariety of factors affecting lifetime credit  \nlosses. These factors include, but are not    \nlimited to, macroeconomic variables such as   \nunemployment rates, real estate prices, gross \ndomestic product levels, inflation, interest  \nrates, and corporate bond spreads, as well as \nloan and borrower characteristics, such as    \ninternal risk ratings on commercial loans and \nconsumer credit scores, delinquency status,   \ncollateral type and available valuation       \ninformation, consideration of end-of-         \ntermlosses on lease residuals, and the        \nremaining term of the loan, adjusted for      \nexpected prepayments. For each loan portfolio,\nincluding those loans modified under various  \nloan modification programs, model estimates   \nare adjusted as necessary to consider any     \nrelevant changes in portfolio composition,    \nlending policies, underwriting standards, risk\nmanagement practices, economic conditions or  \nother factors that may affect the accuracy of \nthe model. Expected credit loss estimates also\ninclude consideration of expected cash        \nrecoveries on loans previously charged-offor  \nexpected recoveries on collateral-dependent   \nloans where recovery is expected through sale \nof the collateral at fair value less selling  \ncosts. Where loans do not exhibit similar risk\ncharacteristics, an individual analysis is    \nperformed to consider expected credit losses. \nThe allowance recorded for individually       \nevaluated loans greater than $5 million in the\ncommercial lending segment is based on an     \nanalysis utilizing expected cash flows        \ndiscounted using the original effective       \ninterest rate, the observable market price of \nthe loan, or the fair value of the collateral,\nless selling costs, for collateral-dependent  \nloans as appropriate. When evaluating the     \nappropriateness of the allowance for credit   \nlosses for any loans and lines in a junior    \nlien position, the Company considers the      \ndelinquency and modification status of the    \nfirst lien. At September 30, 2023, the Company\nserviced the first lien on 30 percent of the  \nhome equity loans and lines in a junior lien  \nposition. The Company also considers the      \nstatus of first lien mortgage accounts        \nreported on customer credit bureau files when \nthe first lien is not serviced by the Company.\nRegardless of whether the Company services the\nfirst lien, an assessment is made of economic \nconditions, problem loans, recent loss        \nexperience and other factors in determining   \nthe allowance for credit losses. Based on the \navailable information, the Company estimated  \n$196 million or 1.5 percent of its total home \nequity portfolio at September 30, 2023,       \nrepresented non-delinquentjunior liens where  \nthe first lien was delinquent or modified.    \nWhen a loan portfolio is purchased, the       \nacquired loans are divided into those         \nconsidered purchased with more than           \ninsignificant credit deterioration (\u201cPCD\u201d) and\nthose not considered PCD. An allowance is     \nestablished for each population and considers \nproduct mix, risk characteristics of the      \nportfolio and delinquency status and refreshed\nLTV ratios when possible. PCD loans also      \nconsider whether the loan has experienced a   \ncharge-off,bankruptcy or significant          \ndeterioration since origination. The allowance\nestablished for purchased loans not considered\nPCD is recognized through provision expense   \nupon acquisition, whereas the allowance       \nestablished for loans considered PCD at       \nacquisition is offset by an                   \n                      \n  18    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nincrease in the basis of the acquired loans.  \nAny subsequent increases and decreases in the \nallowance related to purchased loans,         \nregardless of PCD status, are recognized      \nthrough provision expense, with charge-offs   \ncharged to the allowance. The Company had a   \ntotal unpaid principal balance of $3.3 billion\nof PCD loans, primarily related to the MUB    \nacquisition, included in its loan portfolio at\nSeptember 30, 2023. The Company\u2019s methodology \nfor determining the appropriate allowance for \ncredit losses also considers the imprecision  \ninherent in the methodologies used and        \nallocated to the various loan portfolios. As a\nresult, amounts determined under the          \nmethodologies described above are adjusted by \nmanagement to consider the potential impact of\nother qualitative factors not captured in     \nquantitative model adjustments which include, \nbut are not limited to, the following: model  \nimprecision, imprecision in economic scenario \nassumptions, and emerging risks related to    \neither changes in the economic environment    \nthat are affecting specific portfolios, or    \nchanges in portfolio concentrations over time \nthat may affect model performance. The        \nconsideration of these items results in       \nadjustments to allowance amounts included in  \nthe Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses for \neach loan portfolio. Although the Company     \ndetermined the amount of each element of the  \nallowance separately and considers this       \nprocess to be an important credit management  \ntool, the entire allowance for credit losses  \nis available for the entire loan portfolio.   \nThe actual amount of losses can vary          \nsignificantly from the estimated amounts. At  \nSeptember 30, 2023, the allowance for credit  \nlosses was $7.8 billion (2.08 percent of      \nperiod-endloans), compared with an allowance  \nof $7.4 billion (1.91 percent of period-      \nendloans) at December 31, 2022. The allowance \nfor credit losses at September 30, 2023       \nincluded a $62 million decrease due to a      \nchange in accounting principle adopted on     \nJanuary 1, 2023 related to discontinuing the  \nseparate recognition and measurement of       \ntroubled debt restructurings. The increase in \nthe allowance for credit losses at September  \n30, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, was\nprimarily driven by increased economic        \nuncertainty, normalizing credit losses and    \ncommercial real estate credit quality.        \nEconomic uncertainty and recession risk have  \nincreased due to rising interest rates,       \ninflationary concerns, market volatility and  \npressure on corporate earnings related to     \nthese factors. In addition to these broad     \neconomic factors, expected loss estimates     \nconsider various factors including customer   \nspecific information impacting changes in risk\nratings, projected delinquencies and the      \nimpact of economic deterioration on selected  \nborrowers\u2019 liquidity and ability to repay. The\nratio of the allowance for credit losses to   \nnonperforming loans was 615 percent at        \nSeptember 30, 2023, compared with 762 percent \nat December 31, 2022. The ratio of the        \nallowance for credit losses to annualized loan\nnet charge-offs was 468 percent at September  \n30, 2023, compared with 697 percent of full   \nyear 2022 net charge-offs at December 31,     \n2022. Economic conditions considered in       \nestimating the allowance for credit losses at \nSeptember 30, 2023 included changes in        \nprojected gross domestic product and          \nunemployment levels. These factors are        \nevaluated through a combination of            \nquantitative calculations using multiple      \neconomic scenarios and additional qualitative \nassessments that consider the high degree of  \neconomic uncertainty in the current           \nenvironment. The projected unemployment rates \nfor 2023 considered in the estimate range from\n3.2 percent to 5.9 percent.

As of September 30, 2023, no          \nsignificant change in the amount of residual  \nvalues or concentration of the portfolios had \noccurred since December 31, 2022.

Operational risk is   \ninherent in all business activities, and the  \nmanagement of this risk is important to the   \nachievement of the Company\u2019s objectives.      \nBusiness lines have direct and primary        \nresponsibility and accountability for         \nidentifying, controlling, and monitoring      \noperational risks embedded in their business  \nactivities, including those additional or     \nincreased risks created by economic and       \nfinancial disruptions. The Company maintains a\nsystem of controls with the objective of      \nproviding proper transaction authorization and\nexecution, proper system operations, proper   \noversight of third parties with whom it does  \nbusiness, safeguarding of assets from misuse  \nor theft, and ensuring the reliability and    \nsecurity of financial and other data.

Compliance Risk  \nManagement The Company may suffer legal or    \nregulatory sanctions, material financial loss,\nor damage to its reputation through failure to\ncomply with laws, regulations, rules,         \nstandards of good practice, and codes of      \nconduct, including those related to compliance\nwith Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering   \nrequirements, sanctions compliance            \nrequirements as administered by the Office of \nForeign Assets Control, consumer protection   \nand other requirements. The Company has       \ncontrols and processes in place for the       \nassessment, identification, monitoring,       \nmanagement and reporting of compliance risks  \nand issues, including those created or        \nincreased by economic and financial           \ndisruptions. Refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion\nand Analysis \u2014 Compliance Risk Management\u201d in \nthe Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor   \nthe year ended December 31, 2022, for further \ndiscussion on compliance risk management.     \nInterest Rate Risk Management In the banking  \nindustry, changes in interest rates are a     \nsignificant risk that can impact earnings and \nthe safety and soundness of an entity. The    \nCompany manages its exposure to changes in    \ninterest rates through asset and liability    \nmanagement activities within guidelines       \nestablished by its Asset Liability Management \nCommittee (\u201cALCO\u201d) and approved by the Board  \nof Directors. The ALCO has the responsibility \nfor approving and overseeing compliance with  \nthe ALCO management policies, including       \ninterest rate risk exposure. One way the      \nCompany measures and analyzes its interest    \nrate risk is through net interest income      \nsimulation analysis. Simulation analysis      \nincorporates substantially all of the         \nCompany\u2019s assets and liabilities and off-     \nbalancesheet instruments, together with       \nforecasted changes in the balance sheet and   \nassumptions that reflect the current interest \nrate environment. Through this simulation,    \nmanagement estimates the impact on net        \ninterest income of various interest rate      \nchanges that differ in the direction, amount  \nand speed of change over time, as well as the \nshape of the yield curve. This simulation     \nincludes assumptions about how the balance    \nsheet is likely to be affected by changes in  \nloan and deposit growth. Assumptions are made \nto project interest rates for new loans and   \ndeposits based on historical analysis,        \nmanagement\u2019s outlook and re-pricingstrategies.\nThese assumptions are reviewed and validated  \non a periodic basis with sensitivity analysis \nbeing provided for key variables of the       \nsimulation. The results are reviewed monthly  \nby the ALCO and are used to guide             \nasset/liability management strategies. The    \nCompany manages its interest rate risk        \nposition by holding assets with desired       \ninterest rate risk characteristics on its     \nbalance sheet, implementing certain pricing   \nstrategies for loans and deposits and         \nselecting derivatives and various funding and \ninvestment portfolio strategies. The Company  \nalso manages interest rate sensitivity by     \nutilizing market value of equity modeling,    \nwhich measures the degree to which the market \nvalues of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities\nand off-balancesheet instruments will change  \ngiven a change in interest rates. Management  \nmeasures the impact of changes in market      \nvalues due to interest rates under a number of\nscenarios, including immediate and sustained  \nparallel shifts, and flattening or steepening \nof the yield curve. Table 9 summarizes the    \nprojected impact to net interest income over  \nthe next 12 months of various potential       \ninterest rate changes.

While the      \nCompany utilizes models and assumptions based \non historical information and expected        \nbehaviors, actual outcomes could vary         \nsignificantly. Net interest income            \nsensitivities reflect the impact of current   \nmarket expectations for interest rates,       \ndriving an increase in baseline projected net \ninterest income. As market expectations are   \nreflected in projected results, incremental   \ninterest rate sensitivity declines on a       \npercentage basis. Use of Derivatives to Manage\nInterest Rate and Other Risks To manage the   \nsensitivity of earnings and capital to        \ninterest rate, prepayment, credit, price and  \nforeign currency fluctuations (asset and      \nliability management positions), the Company  \nenters into derivative transactions. The      \nCompany uses derivatives for asset and        \nliability management purposes primarily in the\nfollowing ways:                               \n                                              \n       To convert fixed-rate debt             \n  \u2022    andavailable-for-saleinvestment        \n       securities from fixed-rate payments    \n       to floating-rate payments;             \n                                              \n                                              \n       To convert floating-rate loans and     \n  \u2022    debt from floating-rate payments to    \n       fixed-rate payments;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate changes in value of the    \n  \u2022    Company\u2019s unfunded mortgage loan       \n       commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs;    \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate remeasurement volatility   \n  \u2022    of foreign currency denominated        \n       balances; and                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate the volatility of the      \n  \u2022    Company\u2019s net investment in foreign    \n       operations driven by fluctuations in   \n       foreign currency exchange rates.       \n                                              \nIn addition, the Company enters into interest \nrate, foreign exchange and commodity          \nderivative contracts to support the business  \nrequirements of its customers (customer-      \nrelated positions). The Company minimizes the \nmarket and liquidity risks of customer-related\npositions by either entering into similar     \noffsetting positions with broker-dealers, or  \non a portfolio basis by entering into other   \nderivative or non-derivativefinancial         \ninstruments that partially or fully offset the\nexposure from these customer-related          \npositions. The Company may enter into         \nderivative contracts that are either exchange-\ntraded, centrally cleared through             \nclearinghouses or over-the-counter.The Company\ndoes not utilize derivatives for speculative  \npurposes. The Company does not designate all  \nof the derivatives that it enters into for    \nrisk management purposes as accounting hedges \nbecause of the inefficiency of applying the   \naccounting requirements and may instead elect \nfair value accounting for the related hedged  \nitems. In particular, the Company enters into \ninterest rate swaps, swaptions, forward       \ncommitments to buy to-be-announcedsecurities  \n(\u201cTBAs\u201d), U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures\nand options on U.S. Treasury futures to       \nmitigate fluctuations in the value of its     \nMSRs, but does not designate those derivatives\nas accounting hedges. Additionally, the       \nCompany uses forward commitments to sell TBAs \nand other commitments to sell residential     \nmortgage loans at specified prices to         \neconomically hedge the interest rate risk in  \nits residential mortgage loan production      \nactivities. The forward commitments to sell   \nand the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on \nloans intended to be sold are considered      \nderivatives under the accounting guidance     \nrelated to accounting for derivative          \ninstruments and hedging activities. The       \nCompany has elected the fair value option for \nthe MLHFS. Derivatives are subject to credit  \nrisk associated with counterparties to the    \ncontracts. Credit risk associated with        \nderivatives is measured by the Company based  \non the probability of counterparty default.   \nThe Company manages the credit risk of its    \nderivative positions by diversifying its      \npositions among various counterparties, by    \nentering into master netting arrangements,    \nand, where possible, by requiring collateral  \narrangements. The Company may also transfer   \ncounterparty credit risk related to interest  \nrate swaps to third parties through the use of\nrisk participation agreements. In addition,   \ncertain interest rate swaps, interest rate    \nforwards and credit contracts are required to \nbe centrally cleared through clearinghouses to\nfurther mitigate counterparty credit risk. The\nCompany also mitigates the credit risk of its \nderivative positions, as well as the credit   \nrisk on loans or lending portfolios, through  \nthe use of credit contracts. For additional   \ninformation on derivatives and hedging        \nactivities, refer to Notes 13 and 14 in the   \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   \nLIBOR Transition In July 2017, the United     \nKingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the    \n\u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it would no longer      \nrequire banks to submit rates for             \n                      \n  22    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nthe London InterBank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d)   \nafter 2021. As of July 3, 2023, all tenors of \nLIBOR have ceased to be published or          \nrepresentative. The Company holds financial   \ninstruments impacted by the discontinuance of \nLIBOR, including certain loans, investment    \nsecurities, derivatives, borrowings and other \nfinancial instruments that use LIBOR as the   \nbenchmark rate. The Company also provides     \nvarious services to customers in its          \ncapacities as trustee, servicer, and asset    \nmanager, which involve financial instruments  \nthat are similarly impacted by the            \ndiscontinuance of LIBOR. The Company has      \nimplemented its remediation strategy for its  \nfinancial instruments associated with all     \nLIBOR currencies and tenors and has           \nestablished processes and procedures to       \naddress inquiries from customers and other    \nthird-parties regarding the LIBOR transition. \nThe Company has applied the Adjustable        \nInterest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the \u201cLIBOR Act\u201d)   \nand the Regulations Implementing the LIBOR Act\n(Regulation ZZ) (the \u201cFinal Rules\u201d) to        \nsubstantially all financial instruments that  \nare eligible. The LIBOR Act and Final Rules   \nestablished a process for replacing LIBOR in  \nexisting LIBOR contracts that did not provide \nfor the use of a clearly defined or           \npracticable replacement benchmark rate by     \nproviding that a benchmark replacement        \nidentified by the Federal Reserve Board that  \nis based on the Secured Overnight Financing   \nRate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) replaces LIBOR as the benchmark \nfor those contracts as a matter of law,       \nwithout the need to be amended by the parties.\nBecause financial instruments will transition \nto an alternative reference rate (\u201cARR\u201d) at   \nthe first reset date LIBOR is unavailable,    \nmany products will continue to accrue interest\non LIBOR for a period of time after cessation,\nbut these financial instruments all have a    \ntransition plan in place as of the cessation  \nof LIBOR. Refer to \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in the      \nCompany\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor the   \nyear ended December 31, 2022, for further     \ndiscussion on potential risks that could      \nadversely affect the Company\u2019s financial      \nresults as a result of the LIBOR transition.  \nMarket Risk Management In addition to interest\nrate risk, the Company is exposed to other    \nforms of market risk, principally related to  \ntrading activities which support customers\u2019   \nstrategies to manage their own foreign        \ncurrency, interest rate risk, commodities risk\nand funding activities. For purposes of its   \ninternal capital adequacy assessment process, \nthe Company considers risk arising from its   \ntrading activities, as well as the            \nremeasurement volatility of foreign currency  \ndenominated balances included on its          \nConsolidated Balance Sheet (collectively,     \n\u201cCovered Positions\u201d), employing methodologies \nconsistent with the requirements of regulatory\nrules for market risk. The Company\u2019s Market   \nRisk Committee (\u201cMRC\u201d), within the framework  \nof the ALCO, oversees market risk management. \nThe MRC monitors and reviews the Company\u2019s    \nCovered Positions and establishes policies for\nmarket risk management, including exposure    \nlimits for each portfolio. The Company uses a \nVaR approach to measure general market risk.  \nTheoretically, VaR represents the statistical \nrisk of loss the Company has to adverse market\nmovements over a one-daytime horizon. The     \nCompany uses the Historical Simulation method \nto calculate VaR for its Covered Positions    \nmeasured at the ninety-ninth percentile using \na one-yearlook-back period for distributions  \nderived from past market data. The market     \nfactors used in the calculations include those\npertinent to market risks inherent in the     \nunderlying trading portfolios, principally    \nthose that affect the Company\u2019s corporate bond\ntrading business, foreign currency transaction\nbusiness, client derivatives business, loan   \ntrading business and municipal securities     \nbusiness, as well as those inherent in the    \nCompany\u2019s foreign denominated balances and the\nderivatives used to mitigate the related      \nmeasurement volatility. On average, the       \nCompany expects the one-dayVaR to be exceeded \nby actual losses two to three times per year  \nrelated to these positions. The Company       \nmonitors the accuracy of internal VaR models  \nand modeling processes by back-testing model  \nperformance, regularly updating the historical\ndata used by the VaR models and regular model \nvalidations to assess the accuracy of the     \nmodels\u2019 input, processing, and reporting      \ncomponents. All models are required to be     \nindependently reviewed and approved prior to  \nbeing placed in use. If the Company were to   \nexperience market losses in excess of the     \nestimated VaR more often than expected, the   \nVaR models and associated assumptions would be\nanalyzed and adjusted.

The Company engages in various  \nactivities to manage its liquidity risk. These\nactivities include diversifying its funding   \nsources, stress testing, and holding readily- \nmarketable assets which can be used as a      \nsource of liquidity if needed. In addition,   \nthe Company\u2019s profitable operations, sound    \ncredit quality and strong credit ratings and  \ncapital position have enabled it to develop a \nlarge and reliable base of core deposit       \nfunding within its market areas and in        \ndomestic and global capital markets. The      \nCompany\u2019s Board of Directors approves the     \nCompany\u2019s liquidity policy. The Risk          \nManagement Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of\nDirectors oversees the Company\u2019s liquidity    \nrisk management process and approves a        \ncontingency funding plan. The ALCO reviews the\nCompany\u2019s liquidity policy and limits, and    \nregularly assesses the Company\u2019s ability to   \nmeet funding requirements arising from adverse\ncompany-specific or market events. The Company\nregularly projects its funding needs under    \nvarious stress scenarios and maintains a      \ncontingency funding plan consistent with the  \nCompany\u2019s access to diversified sources of    \ncontingent funding. The Company maintains a   \nsubstantial level of total available liquidity\nin the form of on-balancesheet and off-       \nbalancesheet funding sources. These liquidity \nsources include cash at the Federal Reserve   \nBank and certain European central banks,      \nunencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to   \nborrow from the FHLB and at the Federal       \nReserve Bank\u2019s Discount Window and new Bank   \nTerm Funding Program, created in 2023.        \nUnencumbered liquid assets in the Company\u2019s   \ninvestment securities portfolio provide asset \nliquidity through the Company\u2019s ability to    \nsell the securities or pledge and borrow      \nagainst them. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to \nConsolidated Financial Statements and \u201cBalance\nSheet Analysis\u201d for further information on    \ninvestment securities maturities and trends.  \nAsset liquidity is further enhanced by the    \nCompany\u2019s practice of pledging loans to access\nsecured borrowing facilities through the FHLB \nand Federal Reserve Bank.

Long-term debt\nwas $43.1 billion at September 30, 2023, and  \nis an important funding source because of its \nmulti-year borrowing structure. Short-term    \nborrowings were $21.9 billion at September 30,\n2023, and supplement the Company\u2019s other      \nfunding sources. Refer to \u201cBalance Sheet      \nAnalysis\u201d for further information on the      \nCompany\u2019s long-term debt and short-term       \nborrowings. In addition to assessing liquidity\nrisk on a consolidated basis, the Company     \nmonitors the parent company\u2019s liquidity. The  \nparent company\u2019s routine funding requirements \nconsist primarily of operating expenses,      \ndividends paid to shareholders, debt service, \nrepurchases of common stock and funds used for\nacquisitions. The parent company obtains      \nfunding to meet its obligations from dividends\ncollected from its subsidiaries and the       \nissuance of debt and capital securities. The  \nCompany establishes limits for the minimal    \nnumber of months into the future where the    \nparent company can meet existing and          \nforecasted obligations with cash and          \nsecurities held that can be readily monetized.\nThe Company measures and manages this limit in\nboth normal and adverse conditions. The       \nCompany maintains sufficient funding to meet  \nexpected capital and debt service obligations \nfor 24 months without the support of dividends\nfrom subsidiaries and assuming access to the  \nwholesale markets is maintained. The Company  \nmaintains sufficient liquidity to meet its    \ncapital and debt service obligations for 12   \nmonths under adverse conditions without the   \nsupport of dividends from subsidiaries or     \naccess to the wholesale markets. The parent   \ncompany is currently in excess of required    \nliquidity minimums. At September 30, 2023,    \nparent company long-term debt outstanding was \n$33.1 billion, compared with $27.0 billion at \nDecember 31, 2022. The increase was primarily \ndue to $7.2 billion of medium-term note       \nissuances, partially offset by a $936 million \nrepayment of the Company\u2019s debt obligation to \nMUFG. As of September 30, 2023, there was no  \nparent company debt scheduled to mature in the\nremainder of 2023. Future debt maturities may \nbe met through medium-term note and capital   \nsecurity issuances and dividends from         \nsubsidiaries, as well as from parent company  \ncash and cash equivalents. The Company is     \nsubject to a regulatory Liquidity Coverage    \nRatio (\u201cLCR\u201d) requirement which requires banks\nto maintain an adequate level of unencumbered \nhigh quality liquid assets to meet estimated  \nliquidity needs over a 30-daystressed period. \nAt September 30, 2023, the Company was        \ncompliant with this requirement. The Company  \nis also subject to a regulatory Net Stable    \nFunding Ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) requirement which      \nrequires banks to maintain a minimum level of \nstable funding based on the liquidity         \ncharacteristics of their assets, commitments, \nand derivative exposures over a one-yeartime  \nhorizon. At September 30, 2023, the Company   \nwas compliant with this requirement. Refer to \n\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \u2014       \nLiquidity Risk Management\u201d in the Company\u2019s   \nAnnual Report on Form 10-Kfor the year ended  \nDecember 31, 2022, for further discussion on  \nliquidity risk management. European Exposures \nThe Company provides merchant processing and  \ncorporate trust services in Europe either     \ndirectly or through banking affiliations in   \nEurope. Revenue generated from sources in     \nEurope represented approximately 2 percent of \nthe Company\u2019s total net revenue for both the  \nthree and nine months ended September 30,     \n2023. Operating cash for these businesses is  \ndeposited on a short-term basis typically with\ncertain European central banks. For deposits  \nplaced at other European banks, exposure is   \nmitigated by the Company placing deposits at  \nmultiple banks and managing the amounts on    \ndeposit at any bank based on institution-     \nspecific deposit limits. At September 30,     \n2023, the Company had an aggregate amount on  \ndeposit with European banks of approximately  \n$7.2 billion, predominately with the Central  \nBank of Ireland and Bank of England. In       \naddition, the Company provides financing to   \ndomestic multinational corporations that      \ngenerate revenue from customers in European   \ncountries, transacts with various European    \nbanks as counterparties to certain derivative-\nrelated activities, and through a subsidiary, \nmanages money market funds that hold certain  \ninvestments in European sovereign debt. Any   \ndeterioration in economic conditions in       \nEurope, including the impacts resulting from  \nthe Russia-Ukraine conflict, is not expected  \nto have a significant effect on the Company   \nrelated to these activities.                  \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    25  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                         \n  Table\u200910    Regulatory Capital Ratios  \n                                         \n                                              \n  (Dolla\u2026       Septemb\u2026          Decemb\u2026     \n  in                 30,              31,     \n  Millio\u2026           2023             2022     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Basel                                       \n  III                                         \n  standa\u2026                                     \n  approa\u2026                                     \n  Common                                      \n  equity     $    44,655       $   41,560     \n  tier 1                                      \n  capital                                     \n  Tier 1          51,906           48,813     \n  capital                                     \n  Total                                       \n  risk-b\u2026         61,737           59,015     \n  capital                                     \n  Risk-w\u2026        462,250          496,500     \n  assets                                      \n  Common                                      \n  equity                                      \n  tier 1                                      \n  capital                                     \n  as a               9.7  %           8.4  %  \n  percent                                     \n  of                                          \n  risk-w\u2026                                     \n  assets                                      \n  (a)                                         \n  Tier 1                                      \n  capital                                     \n  as a                                        \n  percent           11.2              9.8     \n  of                                          \n  risk-w\u2026                                     \n  assets                                      \n  Total                                       \n  risk-b\u2026                                     \n  capital                                     \n  as a              13.4             11.9     \n  percent                                     \n  of                                          \n  risk-w\u2026                                     \n  assets                                      \n  Tier 1                                      \n  capital                                     \n  as a                                        \n  percent                                     \n  of                                          \n  adjust\u2026            7.9              7.9     \n  quarte\u2026                                     \n  average                                     \n  assets                                      \n  (lever\u2026                                     \n  ratio)                                      \n  Tier 1                                      \n  capital                                     \n  as a                                        \n  percent                                     \n  of                                          \n  totalo\u2026            6.4              6.4     \n  levera\u2026                                     \n  exposu\u2026                                     \n  (total                                      \n  levera\u2026                                     \n  exposu\u2026                                     \n  ratio)                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n       The Company\u2019s common equity tier 1     \n       capital to risk-weighted assets        \n       ratio, reflecting the full             \n       implementation of the CECL             \n       methodology, was 9.5\u00a0percent at        \n       September\u00a030, 2023, compared with 8.1  \n       percent at December\u00a031, 2022.

These            \narrangements include commitments to extend    \ncredit, letters of credit and various forms of\nguarantees. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to  \nConsolidated Financial Statements for further \ninformation on guarantees and contingent      \nliabilities. These arrangements also include  \nany obligation related to a variable interest \nheld in an unconsolidated entity that provides\nfinancing, liquidity, credit enhancement or   \nmarket risk support. Refer to Note 6 of the   \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements for\nfurther information related to the Company\u2019s  \ninterests in variable interest entities.      \nCapital Management The Company is committed to\nmanaging capital to maintain strong protection\nfor depositors and creditors and for maximum  \nshareholder benefit. The Company also manages \nits capital to exceed regulatory capital      \nrequirements for banking organizations. To    \nachieve its capital goals, the Company employs\na variety of capital management tools,        \nincluding dividends, common share repurchases,\nand the issuance of subordinated debt, non-   \ncumulativeperpetual preferred stock, common   \nstock and other capital instruments. The      \nregulatory capital requirements effective for \nthe Company follow Basel III, with the Company\nbeing subject to calculating its capital      \nadequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted     \nassets under the standardized approach.       \nBeginning in 2022, the Company began to phase \ninto its regulatory capital requirements the  \ncumulative deferred impact of its 2020        \nadoption of the accounting guidance related to\nthe impairment of financial instruments based \non the current expected credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d)\nmethodology plus 25 percent of its quarterly  \ncredit reserve increases during 2020 and 2021.\nThis cumulative deferred impact will continue \nto be phased into the Company\u2019s regulatory    \ncapital over the next two years, culminating  \nwith a fully phased in regulatory capital     \ncalculation beginning in 2025. Table 10       \nprovides a summary of statutory regulatory    \ncapital ratios in effect for the Company at   \nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. All \nregulatory ratios exceeded regulatory \u201cwell-  \ncapitalized\u201d requirements. As a bank holding  \ncompany with over $100 billion in total       \nconsolidated assets, the Company is subject to\nthe Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s enhanced prudential      \nstandards, as applied to \u201cCategory III\u201d       \ninstitutions under the federal banking        \nregulators\u2019 rules that tailor how enhanced    \nprudential standards apply to large U.S.      \nbanking organizations (the \u201cTailoring Rules\u201d).\nIn connection with the Company\u2019s acquisition  \nof MUB, the Company committed to submit to the\nFederal Reserve quarterly implementation plans\nfor complying with requirements associated    \nwith a \u201cCategory II\u201d banking organization     \n(i.e., institutions with $700 billion or more \nin total assets or $75 billion or more in     \ncross-jurisdictional activities). The Company \nalso committed to meet requirements applicable\nto Category II banking organizations by the   \nearlier of (i) the date required under the    \nTailoring Rules; and (ii) December 31, 2024,  \nif the Federal Reserve notifies the Company by\nJanuary 1, 2024, that the Company must comply \nwith those requirements. On October 16, 2023, \nthe Federal Reserve granted the Company full  \nrelief from both of these commitments. As a   \nresult, the Company will continue to be       \nsubject to the regulatory capital requirements\napplicable to Category III institutions. In   \nJuly 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory   \nauthorities proposed a rule implementing the  \nBasel Committee\u2019s finalization of the post-   \ncrisis regulatory capital reforms. The        \nproposal provides for a July 1, 2025 effective\ndate, subject to a three-year transition      \nperiod. The proposal incl udesthe Fundamental \nReview of the Trading Book, which replaces the\nmarket risk rule, and introduces new          \nstandardized approaches for credit risk,      \n                      \n  26    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \noperational risk and credit valuation         \nadjustment (CVA) risk, which would replace the\ncurrent models-based approaches. The Company  \nis currently evaluating the impact of the     \nproposed rule and expects that any final rule \nwould result in the Company being required to \nmaintain increased levels of regulatory       \ncapital. The Company believes certain other   \ncapital ratios are useful in evaluating its   \ncapital adequacy. The Company\u2019s tangible      \ncommon equity, as a percent of tangible assets\nand as a percent of risk-weighted assets      \ndetermined in accordance with transitional    \nregulatory capital requirements related to the\nCECL methodology under the standardized       \napproach, was 5.0 percent and 7.0 percent,    \nrespectively, at September 30, 2023, compared \nwith 4.5 percent and 6.0 percent,             \nrespectively, at December 31, 2022. In        \naddition, the Company\u2019s common equity tier 1  \ncapital to risk-weighted assets ratio,        \nreflecting the full implementation of the CECL\nmethodology was 9.5 percent at September 30,  \n2023, compared with 8.1 percent at December   \n31, 2022. Refer to \u201cNon-GAAPFinancial         \nMeasures\u201d beginning on page 32 for further    \ninformation on these other capital ratios.    \nTotal U.S. Bancorp shareholders\u2019 equity was   \n$53.1 billion at September 30, 2023, compared \nwith $50.8 billion at December 31, 2022. The  \nincrease was primarily the result of corporate\nearnings and the issuance of shares of common \nstock, partially offset by dividends paid and \nchanges in unrealized gains and losses on     \navailable-for-saleinvestment securities       \nincluded in other comprehensive income (loss).\nIn the third quarter of 2023, the Company     \nissued 24 million shares of common stock of   \nthe Company to an affiliate of MUFG for a     \npurchase price of $936 million. The proceeds  \nof the issuance were used to repay a portion  \nof the Company\u2019s $3.5 billion debt obligation \nto MUFG. See \u201cMUFG Union Bank Acquisition\u201d on \npage 5 for further information. The Company   \nannounced on December 22, 2020 that its Board \nof Directors had approved an authorization to \nrepurchase $3.0 billion of its common stock   \nbeginning January 1, 2021. The Company        \nsuspended all common stock repurchases at the \nbeginning of the third quarter of 2021, except\nfor those done exclusively in connection with \nits stock-based compensation programs, due to \nits acquisition of MUB.

useful additional methods of    \nevaluating the Company\u2019s utilization of its   \ncapital held and the level of capital         \navailable to withstand unexpected negative    \nmarket or economic conditions. Additionally,  \npresentation of these measures allows         \ninvestors, analysts and banking regulators to \nassess the Company\u2019s capital position relative\nto other financial services companies. These  \ncapital measures are not defined in generally \naccepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), or   \nare not currently effective or defined in     \nbanking regulations. In addition, certain of  \nthese measures differ from currently effective\ncapital ratios defined by banking regulations \nprincipally in that the currently effective   \nratios, which are subject to certain          \ntransitional provisions, temporarily exclude  \nthe impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting \nguidance related to impairment of financial   \ninstruments based on the CECL methodology. As \na result, these capital measures disclosed by \nthe Company may be considered non-            \nGAAPfinancial measures. Management believes   \nthis information helps investors assess trends\nin the Company\u2019s capital adequacy. The Company\nalso discloses net interest income and related\nratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent   \nbasis, which may also be considered non-      \nGAAPfinancial measures. The Company believes  \nthis presentation to be the preferred industry\nmeasurement of net interest income as it      \nprovides a relevant comparison of net interest\nincome arising from taxable and tax-          \nexemptsources. In addition, certain           \nperformance measures, including the efficiency\nratio and net interest margin utilize net     \ninterest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.\nThe Company also discloses the net charge-off \nratio excluding notable items related to the  \nacquisition of MUB, and other balance sheet   \nrepositioning and capital management actions  \ntaken by the Company. Management believes this\nmeasure enhances comparability with prior     \nperiods. There may be limits in the usefulness\nof these measures to investors. As a result,  \nthe Company encourages readers to consider the\nconsolidated financial statements and other   \nfinancial information contained in this report\nin their entirety, and not to rely on any     \nsingle financial measure.

                              \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting   \nand reporting policies of the Company comply  \nwith accounting principles generally accepted \nin the United States and conform to general   \npractices within the banking industry. The    \npreparation of financial statements in        \nconformity with GAAP requires management to   \nmake estimates and assumptions. The Company\u2019s \nfinancial position and results of operations  \ncan be affected by these estimates and        \nassumptions, which are integral to            \nunderstanding the Company\u2019s financial         \nstatements. Critical accounting policies are  \nthose policies management believes are the    \nmost important to the portrayal of the        \nCompany\u2019s financial condition and results, and\nrequire management to make estimates that are \ndifficult, subjective or complex. Most        \naccounting policies are not considered by     \nmanagement to be critical accounting policies.\nManagement has discussed the development and  \nthe selection of critical accounting policies \nwith the Company\u2019s Audit Committee. Those     \npolicies considered to be critical accounting \npolicies relate to the allowance for credit   \nlosses, fair value estimates, MSRs, and income\ntaxes. These accounting policies are discussed\nin detail in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and     \nAnalysis \u2014 Critical Accounting Policies\u201d and  \nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor\nthe year ended December 31, 2022. CONTROLS AND\nPROCEDURES Under the supervision and with the \nparticipation of the Company\u2019s management,    \nincluding its principal executive officer and \nprincipal financial officer, the Company has  \nevaluated the effectiveness of the design and \noperation of its disclosure controls and      \nprocedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)and  \n15d-15(e)under the Securities Exchange Act of \n1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)). Based upon this   \nevaluation, the principal executive officer   \nand principal financial officer have concluded\nthat, as of the end of the period covered by  \nthis report, the Company\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures were effective.

accepted in   \nthe United States. In the opinion of          \nmanagement of U.S. Bancorp (the \u201cCompany\u201d),   \nall adjustments (consisting only of normal    \nrecurring adjustments) necessary for a fair   \nstatement of results for the interim periods  \nhave been made. These financial statements and\nnotes should be read in conjunction with the  \nconsolidated financial statements and notes   \nincluded in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on    \nForm 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2022.\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been    \nreclassified to conform to the current period \npresentation.                                 \n                                \n  Note\u20092    Accounting Changes  \n                                \nReference Interest Rate Transition In March   \n2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(\u201cFASB\u201d) issued accounting guidance, providing\ntemporary optional expedients and exceptions  \nto the guidance in United States generally    \naccepted accounting principles on contract    \nmodifications and hedge accounting, to ease   \nthe financial reporting burdens related to the\nexpected market transition from the London    \nInterbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and other    \ninterbank offered rates to alternative        \nreference rates. Under the guidance, a company\ncan elect not to apply certain modification   \naccounting requirements to contracts affected \nby reference rate transition, if certain      \ncriteria are met. A company that makes this   \nelection would not be required to remeasure   \nthe contracts at the modification date or     \nreassess a previous accounting determination. \nThis guidance also permits a company to elect \nvarious optional expedients that would allow  \nit to continue applying hedge accounting for  \nhedging relationships affected by reference   \nrate transition, if certain criteria are met. \nThe guidance is effective upon issuance and   \ngenerally can be applied through December\u00a031, \n2024. The Company is applying certain optional\nexpedients and exceptions for cash flow hedges\nand will continue to evaluate these for       \neligible contract modifications and hedging   \nrelationships.                                \nFair Value Hedging \u2013 Portfolio Layer Method   \nEffective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted\naccounting guidance, issued by the FASB in    \nMarch 2022, related to fair value hedge       \naccounting of portfolios of financial assets. \nThis guidance permits a company to designate  \nmultiple hedging relationships on a single    \nclosed portfolio, resulting in a larger       \nportion of the interest rate risk associated  \nwith such a portfolio being eligible to be    \nhedged. The guidance also expands the scope of\nthe method to include non-prepayable financial\nassets and clarifies other technical questions\nfrom the original accounting guidance. The    \nadoption of this guidance was not material to \nthe Company\u2019s financial statements.           \nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Troubled Debt         \nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures        \nEffective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted\naccounting guidance on a modified             \nretrospective basis, issued by the FASB in    \nMarch 2022, related to the recognition and    \nmeasurement of troubled debt restructurings   \n(\u201cTDRs\u201d) by creditors. This guidance removes  \nthe separate recognition and measurement      \nrequirements for TDRs by replacing them with a\nrequirement for a company to apply existing   \naccounting guidance to determine whether a    \nmodification results in a new loan or a       \ncontinuation of an existing loan. This        \nguidance also replaces existing TDR           \ndisclosures with similar but more expansive   \ndisclosures for certain modifications of      \nreceivables made to borrowers experiencing    \nfinancial difficulty. Further, this guidance  \nalso requires companies to disclose current-  \nperiod gross write-offs by year of origination\nfor financing receivables. The adoption of    \nthis guidance was not material to the         \nCompany\u2019s financial statements.               \nAccounting for Tax Credit Investments Using   \nthe Proportional Amortization Method Effective\nJanuary 1, 2023, the Company adopted          \naccounting guidance on a modified             \nretrospective basis, issued by the FASB in    \nMarch 2023, related to the accounting for tax \ncredit investments. This guidance allows the  \nCompany to elect to account for tax credit    \ninvestments using the proportional            \namortization method on a program-by-          \nprogrambasis if certain conditions are met,   \nregardless of the program from which the      \nincome tax credits are received. The adoption \nof this guidance was not material to the      \nCompany\u2019s financial statements.               \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    39  \n                      \nTable of Contents\n                                   \n  Note\u20023    Business Combinations  \n                                   \nMUFG Union Bank Acquisition On December 1,    \n2022, the Company acquired MUB\u2019s core regional\nbanking franchise from MUFG. Pursuant to the  \nterms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the    \nCompany acquired all of the issued and        \noutstanding shares of common stock of MUB for \na purchase price consisting of $ 5.5billion in\ncash and approximately 44million shares of    \ncommon stock of the Company. Under the terms  \nof the Share Purchase Agreement, the purchase \nprice was based on MUB having a tangible book \nvalue of $ 6.25billion at the closing of the  \nacquisition. At the closing of the            \nacquisition, MUB had $ 3.5billion of tangible \nbook value over the $ 6.25billion target,     \nconsisting of additional cash. The additional \ncash received is required to be repaid to MUFG\non or prior to the fifth anniversary date of  \nthe completion of the purchase, in accordance \nwith the terms of the Share Purchase          \nAgreement. As such, it is recognized as debt  \nat the parent company. On August 3, 2023, the \nCompany repaid $ 936million of its debt       \nobligation from the proceeds of the issuance  \nof 24million shares of common stock of the    \nCompany to an affiliate of MUFG. The          \nacquisition has been accounted for as a       \nbusiness combination. Accordingly, the assets \nacquired and liabilities assumed from MUB were\nrecorded at fair value as of the acquisition  \ndate. The determination of fair value requires\nmanagement to make estimates about discount   \nrates, future expected cash flows, market     \nconditions and other future events that are   \nhighly subjective in nature and subject to    \nchange.

If the Company    \nintends to sell or it is more likely than not \nthe Company will be required to sell an       \ninvestment security, the amortized cost of the\nsecurity is written down to fair value. When  \nevaluating credit losses, the Company         \nconsiders various factors such as the nature  \nof the investment security, the credit ratings\nor financial condition of the issuer, the     \nextent of the unrealized loss, expected cash  \nflows of underlying collateral, the existence \nof any government or agency guarantees, and   \nmarket conditions. The Company measures the   \nallowance for credit losses using market      \ninformation where available and discounting   \nthe cash flows at the original effective rate \nof the investment security. The allowance for \ncredit losses is adjusted each period through \nearnings and can be subsequently recovered.   \nThe allowance for credit losses on the        \nCompany\u2019s available-for-sale investment       \nsecurities was immaterial at September\u00a030,    \n2023 and December\u00a031, 2022.                   \n                                              \nAt September\u00a030, 2023, certain investment     \nsecurities had a fair value below amortized   \ncost.

2023, and $ 134.6 billion at    \nDecember\u00a031, 2022, pledged at the Federal Home\nLoan Bank, and loans of $ 83.5 billion at     \nSeptember\u00a030, 2023, and $ 85.8 billion at     \nDecember\u00a031, 2022, pledged at the Federal     \nReserve Bank.                                 \nOriginated loans are reported at the principal\namount outstanding, net of unearned interest  \nand deferred fees and costs, and any partial  \ncharge-offs recorded. Purchased loans are     \nrecorded at fair value at the date of         \npurchase. Net unearned interest and deferred  \nfees and costs on originated loans and        \nunamortized premiums and discounts on         \npurchased loans amounted to $ 2.7 billion at  \nSeptember\u00a030, 2023 and $ 3.1 billion at       \nDecember\u00a031, 2022. The Company evaluates      \npurchased loans for more-than-insignificant   \ndeterioration at the date of purchase in      \naccordance with applicable authoritative      \naccounting guidance. Purchased loans that have\nexperienced more-than-insignificant           \ndeterioration from origination are considered \npurchased credit deteriorated loans. All other\npurchased loans are considered non-purchased  \ncredit deteriorated loans.                    \nAllowance for Credit Losses The allowance for \ncredit losses is established for current      \nexpected credit losses on the Company\u2019s loan  \nand lease portfolio, including unfunded credit\ncommitments. The allowance considers expected \nlosses for the remaining lives of the         \napplicable assets, inclusive of expected      \nrecoveries. The allowance for credit losses is\nincreased through provisions charged to       \nearnings and reduced by net charge-offs.      \nManagement evaluates the appropriateness of   \nthe allowance for credit losses on a quarterly\nbasis.                                        \nMultiple economic scenarios are considered    \nover a three-year reasonable and supportable  \nforecast period, which includes increasing    \nconsideration of historical loss experience   \nover years two and three. These economic      \nscenarios are constructed with interrelated   \nprojections of multiple economic variables,   \nand loss estimates are produced that consider \nthe historical correlation of those economic  \nvariables with credit losses. After the       \nforecast period, the Company fully reverts to \nlong-term historical loss experience, adjusted\nfor prepayments and characteristics of the    \ncurrent loan and lease portfolio, to estimate \nlosses over the remaining life of the         \nportfolio. The economic scenarios are updated \nat least quarterly and are designed to provide\na range of reasonable estimates, from better  \nto worse than current expectations. Scenarios \nare weighted based on the Company\u2019s           \nexpectation of economic conditions for the    \nforeseeable future and reflect significant    \njudgment and consideration of economic        \nforecast uncertainty. Final loss estimates    \nalso consider factors affecting credit losses \nnot reflected in the scenarios, due to the    \nunique aspects of current conditions and      \nexpectations. These factors may include, but  \nare not limited to, loan servicing practices, \nregulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and        \nmonetary policy actions.                      \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    45  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThe allowance recorded for credit losses      \nutilizes forward-looking expected loss models \nto consider a variety of factors affecting    \nlifetime credit losses. These factors include,\nbut are not limited to, macroeconomic         \nvariables such as unemployment rates, real    \nestate prices, gross domestic product levels, \ninflation, interest rates and corporate bonds \nspreads, as well as loan and borrower         \ncharacteristics, such as internal risk ratings\non commercial loans and consumer credit       \nscores, delinquency status, collateral type   \nand available valuation information,          \nconsideration of end-of-term losses on lease  \nresiduals, and the remaining term of the loan,\nadjusted for expected prepayments. For each   \nloan portfolio, including those loans modified\nunder various loan modification programs,     \nmodel estimates are adjusted as necessary to  \nconsider any relevant changes in portfolio    \ncomposition, lending policies, underwriting   \nstandards, risk management practices, economic\nconditions or other factors that would affect \nthe accuracy of the model. Expected credit    \nloss estimates also include consideration of  \nexpected cash recoveries on loans previously  \ncharged-off or expected recoveries on         \ncollateral dependent loans where recovery is  \nexpected through sale of the collateral at    \nfair value less selling costs. Where loans do \nnot exhibit similar risk characteristics, an  \nindividual analysis is performed to consider  \nexpected credit losses. The allowance recorded\nfor individually evaluated loans greater than \n$5\u00a0million in the commercial lending segment  \nis based on an analysis utilizing expected    \ncash flows discounted using the original      \neffective interest rate, the observable market\nprice of the loan, or the fair value of the   \ncollateral, less selling costs, for           \ncollateral-dependent loans as appropriate. For\nsmaller commercial loans collectively         \nevaluated for impairment, historical loss     \nexperience is also incorporated into the      \nallowance methodology applied to this category\nof loans.                                     \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s methodology for determining the \nappropriate allowance for credit losses also  \nconsiders the imprecision inherent in the     \nmethodologies used and allocated to the       \nvarious loan portfolios. As a result, amounts \ndetermined under the methodologies described  \nabove\u00a0are adjusted by management to consider  \nthe potential impact of other qualitative     \nfactors not captured in the quantitative model\nadjustments which include, but are not limited\nto , the following: model imprecision,        \nimprecision in economic scenario assumptions, \nand emerging risks related to either changes  \nin the environment that are affecting specific\nportfolios, or changes in portfolio           \nconcentrations over time that may affect model\nperformance. The consideration of these items \nresults in adjustments to allowance amounts   \nincluded in the Company\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses for each loan portfolio.               \n                                              \nThe Company also assesses the credit risk     \nassociated with off-balance sheet loan        \ncommitments, letters of credit, investment    \nsecurities and derivatives. Credit risk       \nassociated with derivatives is reflected in   \nthe fair values recorded for those positions. \nThe liability for off-balance sheet credit    \nexposure related to loan commitments and other\ncredit guarantees is included in other        \nliabilities. Because business processes and   \ncredit risks associated with unfunded credit  \ncommitments are essentially the same as for   \nloans, the Company utilizes similar processes \nto estimate its liability for unfunded credit \ncommitments.                                  \n                                              \nThe results of the analysis are evaluated     \nquarterly to confirm the estimates are        \nappropriate for each specific loan portfolio, \nas well as the entire loan portfolio, as the  \nentire allowance for credit losses is         \navailable for the entire loan portfolio.      \n                      \n  46    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nActivity in the allowance for credit losses by\nportfolio class was as follows:

losses, levels of      \nnonperforming assets and delinquencies, and   \ncredit quality ratings as defined by the      \nCompany.                                      \n                                              \nFor all loan portfolio classes, loans are     \nconsidered past due based on the number of    \ndays delinquent except for monthly amortizing \nloans which are classified delinquent based   \nupon the number of contractually required     \npayments not made (for example, two missed    \npayments is considered 30 days delinquent).   \nWhen a loan is placed on nonaccrual status,   \nunpaid accrued interest is reversed, reducing \ninterest income in the current period.        \n                                              \nCommercial lending segment loans are generally\nplaced on nonaccrual status when the          \ncollection of principal and interest has      \nbecome 90 days past due or is otherwise       \nconsidered doubtful. Commercial lending       \nsegment loans are generally fully charged down\nif unsecured by collateral or partially       \ncharged down to the fair value of the         \ncollateral securing the loan, less costs to   \nsell, when the loan is placed on nonaccrual.  \n                                              \nConsumer lending segment loans are generally  \ncharged-off at a specific number of days or   \npayments past due. Residential mortgages and  \nother retail loans secured by 1-4 family      \nproperties are generally charged down to the  \nfair value of the collateral securing the     \nloan, less costs to sell, at 180 days past    \ndue. Residential mortgage loans and lines in a\nfirst lien position are placed on nonaccrual  \nstatus in instances where a partial charge-off\noccurs unless the loan is well secured and in \nthe process of collection. Residential        \nmortgage loans and lines in a junior lien     \nposition secured by 1-4 family properties are \nplaced on nonaccrual status at 120 days past  \ndue or when they are behind a first lien that \nhas become 180 days or greater past due or    \nplaced on nonaccrual status. Any secured      \nconsumer lending segment loan whose borrower  \nhas had debt discharged through bankruptcy,   \nfor which the loan amount exceeds the fair    \nvalue of the collateral, is charged down to   \nthe fair value of the related collateral and  \nthe remaining balance is placed on nonaccrual \nstatus. Credit card loans continue to accrue  \ninterest until the account is charged-off.    \nCredit cards are charged-off at 180\u00a0days past \ndue. Other retail loans not secured by 1-4    \nfamily properties are charged-off at 120 days \npast due; and revolving consumer lines are    \ncharged-off at 180 days past due. Similar to  \ncredit cards, other retail loans are generally\nnot placed on nonaccrual status because of the\nrelative short period of time to charge-off.  \nCertain retail customers having financial     \ndifficulties may have the terms of their      \ncredit card and other loan agreements modified\nto require only principal payments and, as    \nsuch, are reported as nonaccrual.             \n                                              \nFor all loan classes, interest payments       \nreceived on nonaccrual loans are generally    \nrecorded as a reduction to a loan\u2019s carrying  \namount while a loan is on nonaccrual and are  \nrecognized as interest income upon payoff of  \nthe loan.

transfers financial assets in the \nnormal course of business. The majority of the\nCompany\u2019s financial asset transfers are       \nresidential mortgage loan sales primarily to  \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d),    \ntransfers of tax-advantaged investments,      \ncommercial loan sales through participation   \nagreements, and other individual or portfolio \nloan and securities sales. In accordance with \nthe accounting guidance for asset transfers,  \nthe Company considers any ongoing involvement \nwith transferred assets in determining whether\nthe assets can be derecognized from the       \nbalance sheet. Guarantees provided to certain \nthird parties in connection with the transfer \nof assets are further discussed in Note 16.   \nFor loans sold under participation agreements,\nthe Company also considers whether the terms  \nof the loan participation agreement meet the  \naccounting definition of a participating      \ninterest. With the exception of servicing and \ncertain performance-based guarantees, the     \nCompany\u2019s continuing involvement with         \nfinancial assets sold is minimal and generally\nlimited to market customary representation and\nwarranty clauses. Any gain or loss on sale    \ndepends on the previous carrying amount of the\ntransferred financial assets, the             \nconsideration received, and any liabilities   \nincurred in exchange for the transferred      \nassets. Upon transfer, any servicing assets   \nand other interests that continue to be held  \nby the Company are initially recognized at    \nfair value. For further information on MSRs,  \nrefer to Note 7. On a limited basis, the      \nCompany may acquire and package high-grade    \ncorporate bonds for select corporate          \ncustomers, in which the Company generally has \nno continuing involvement with these          \ntransactions. Additionally, the Company is an \nauthorized GNMA issuer and issues GNMA        \nsecurities on a regular basis. The Company has\nno other asset securitizations or similar     \nasset-backed financing arrangements that are  \noff-balance sheet.                            \nThe Company previously provided financial     \nsupport primarily through the use of waivers  \nof trust and investment management fees       \nassociated with various unconsolidated        \nregistered money market funds it manages. The \nCompany discontinued providing this support   \nbeginning in the third quarter of 2022 due to \nrising interest rates. The Company provided $ \n65 million of support to the funds during the \nnine months ended September\u00a030, 2022.         \nThe Company is involved in various entities   \nthat are considered to be variable interest   \nentities (\u201cVIEs\u201d). The Company\u2019s investments  \nin VIEs are primarily related to investments  \npromoting affordable housing, community       \ndevelopment and renewable energy sources. Some\nof these tax-advantaged investments support   \nthe Company\u2019s regulatory compliance with the  \nCommunity Reinvestment Act. The Company\u2019s     \ninvestments in these entities generate a      \nreturn primarily through the realization of   \nfederal and state income tax credits, and     \nother tax benefits, such as tax deductions    \nfrom operating losses of the investments, over\nspecified time periods. These tax credits are \nrecognized as a reduction of tax expense or,  \nfor investments qualifying as investment tax  \ncredits, as a reduction to the related        \ninvestment asset. The Company recognized      \nfederal and state income tax credits related  \nto its affordable housing and other tax-      \nadvantaged investments in tax expense of $ 148\nmillion and $ 111 million for the three months\nended September\u00a030, 2023 and 2022,            \nrespectively, and $ 435 million and $ 336     \nmillion for the nine months ended             \nSeptember\u00a030, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The\nCompany also recognized $ 238 million and $   \n117 million of investment tax credits for the \nthree months ended September\u00a030, 2023 and     \n2022, respectively, and $ 474 million and $   \n292 million for the nine months ended         \nSeptember\u00a030, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The\nCompany recognized $ 134 million and $ 102    \nmillion of expenses related to all of these   \ninvestments for the three months ended        \nSeptember\u00a030, 2023 and 2022, respectively,    \nwhich were primarily included in tax expense. \nThe Company recognized $ 399 million and $ 310\nmillion of expenses related to all of these   \ninvestments for the nine months ended         \nSeptember\u00a030, 2023 and 2022, respectively,    \nwhich were primarily included in tax expense. \nThe Company is not required to consolidate    \nVIEs in which it has concluded it does not    \nhave a controlling financial interest, and    \nthus is not the primary beneficiary. In such  \ncases, the Company does not have both the     \npower to direct the entities\u2019 most significant\nactivities and the obligation to absorb losses\nor the right to receive benefits that could   \npotentially be significant to the VIEs.       \nThe Company\u2019s investments in these            \nunconsolidated VIEs are carried in other      \nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The \nCompany\u2019s unfunded capital and other          \ncommitments related to these unconsolidated   \nVIEs are generally carried in other           \nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe Company\u2019s maximum exposure to loss from   \nthese unconsolidated VIEs include the         \ninvestment recorded on the Company\u2019s          \nConsolidated Balance Sheet, net of unfunded   \ncapital commitments, and previously recorded  \ntax credits which remain subject to recapture \nby taxing authorities based on compliance     \nfeatures required to be met at the project    \nlevel. While the Company believes potential   \nlosses from these investments are remote, the \nmaximum exposure was determined by assuming a \nscenario where the community-based business   \nand housing projects completely fail and do   \nnot meet certain government compliance        \nrequirements resulting in recapture of the    \nrelated tax credits.                          \n                      \n  54    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a summary of     \ninvestments in community development and tax- \nadvantaged VIEs that the Company has not      \nconsolidated:                                 \n                                              \n  (Dollars         September        December  \n  in                     30,             31,  \n  Millions)             2023            2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Investme\u2026                                   \n  carrying     $       6,488    $      5,452  \n  amount                                      \n  Unfunded                                    \n  capital              3,186           2,416  \n  and other                                   \n  commitme\u2026                                   \n  Maximum                                     \n  exposure            10,058           9,761  \n  to loss                                     \n                                              \nThe Company also has noncontrolling financial \ninvestments in private investment funds and   \npartnerships considered to be VIEs, which are \nnot consolidated. The Company\u2019s recorded      \ninvestment in these entities, carried in other\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, was \napproximately $ 210 million at September\u00a030,  \n2023 and $ 177 million at December\u00a031, 2022.  \nThe maximum exposure to loss related to these \nVIEs was $ 320 million at September\u00a030, 2023  \nand $ 310 million at December\u00a031, 2022,       \nrepresenting the Company\u2019s investment balance \nand its unfunded commitments to invest        \nadditional amounts.                           \n                                              \nThe Company also held senior notes of $ 5.9   \nbillion as available-for-sale investment      \nsecurities at September\u00a030, 2023, compared    \nwith $ 3.4 billion at December\u00a031, 2022. These\nsenior notes were issued by third-party       \nsecuritization vehicles that held $ 6.8       \nbillion at September\u00a030, 2023 and $ 4.0       \nbillion at December\u00a031, 2022 of indirect auto \nloans that collateralize the senior notes.    \nThese VIEs are not consolidated by the        \nCompany.                                      \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s individual net investments in   \nunconsolidated VIEs, which exclude any        \nunfunded capital commitments, ranged from less\nthan $ 1 million to $ 126 million at          \nSeptember\u00a030, 2023, compared with less than $ \n1 million to $ 116 million at December\u00a031,    \n2022.                                         \n                                              \nThe Company is required to consolidate VIEs in\nwhich it has concluded it has a controlling   \nfinancial interest. The Company sponsors      \nentities to which it transfers its interests  \nin tax-advantaged investments to third        \nparties. At September\u00a030, 2023, approximately \n$ 5.9 billion of the Company\u2019s assets and $   \n4.4 billion of its liabilities included on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet were related to    \ncommunity development and tax-advantaged      \ninvestment VIEs which the Company has         \nconsolidated, primarily related to these      \ntransfers. These amounts compared to $ 5.9    \nbillion and $ 4.2 billion, respectively, at   \nDecember\u00a031, 2022. The majority of the assets \nof these consolidated VIEs are reported in    \nother assets, and the liabilities are reported\nin long-term debt and other liabilities. The  \nassets of a particular VIE are the primary    \nsource of funds to settle its obligations. The\ncreditors of the VIEs do not have recourse to \nthe general credit of the Company. The        \nCompany\u2019s exposure to the consolidated VIEs is\ngenerally limited to the carrying value of its\nvariable interests plus any related tax       \ncredits previously recognized or transferred  \nto others with a guarantee.                   \n                                              \nIn addition, the Company sponsors a municipal \nbond securities tender option bond program.   \nThe Company controls the activities of the    \nprogram\u2019s entities, is entitled to the        \nresidual returns and provides liquidity and   \nremarketing arrangements to the program. As a \nresult, the Company has consolidated the      \nprogram\u2019s entities. At September\u00a030, 2023, $  \n941 million of available-for-sale investment  \nsecurities and $ 333 million of short-term    \nborrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet  \nwere related to the tender option bond        \nprogram, compared with $ 1.5 billion of       \navailable-for-sale investment securities and $\n1.0 billion of short-term borrowings at       \nDecember\u00a031, 2022.                            \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    55  \n                      \nTable of Contents\n                                       \n  Note\u20097    Mortgage Servicing Rights  \n                                       \nThe Company capitalizes MSRs as separate      \nassets when loans are sold and servicing is   \nretained. MSRs may also be purchased from     \nothers. The Company carries MSRs at fair      \nvalue, with changes in the fair value recorded\nin earnings during the period in which they   \noccur. The Company serviced $ 232.3 billion of\nresidential mortgage loans for others at      \nSeptember\u00a030, 2023, and $ 243.6 billion at    \nDecember\u00a031, 2022, including subserviced      \nmortgages with no corresponding MSR asset.    \nIncluded in mortgage banking revenue are the  \nMSR fair value changes arising from market    \nrate and model assumption changes, net of the \nvalue change in derivatives used to           \neconomically hedge MSRs. These changes        \nresulted in net losses of $ 3 million and $ 19\nmillion for the three months ended            \nSeptember\u00a030, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and\nnet losses of $ 45 million and $ 35 million   \nfor the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2023  \nand 2022, respectively. Loan servicing and    \nancillary fees, not including valuation       \nchanges, included in mortgage banking revenue \nwere $ 176 million and $ 190 million for the  \nthree months ended September\u00a030, 2023 and 2022\nrespectively, and $ 553 million and $ 561     \nmillion for the nine months ended             \nSeptember\u00a030, 2023 and 2022, respectively.    \nChanges in fair value of capitalized MSRs are \nsummarized as follows:                        \n                                              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026          \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026         \u2026    \n         1          1          3         7    \n         \u2026          \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n         \u2026  )       \u2014          \u2026  )      1    \n                                              \n         \u2026          \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n         \u2026          \u2026  )       \u2014         \u2026    \n         \u2026  )       \u2026  )       \u2026  )      \u2026    \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026         \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n       MSRs sold include those having a       \n  (a)  negative fair value, resulting from    \n       the loans being severely delinquent.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Includes changes in MSR value          \n       associated with changes in market      \n  (b)  interest rates, including estimated    \n       prepayment rates and anticipated       \n       earnings on escrow deposits.           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Includes changes in MSR value not      \n       caused by changes in market interest   \n  (c)  rates, such as changes in assumed      \n       cost to service, ancillary income and  \n       option adjusted spread, as well as     \n       the impact of any model changes.       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Primarily the change in MSR value      \n       from passage of time and cash flows    \n       realized (decay), but also includes    \n  (d)  the impact of changes to expected      \n       cash flows not associated with         \n       changes in market interest rates,      \n       such as the impact of delinquencies.   \n                                              \nThe estimated sensitivity to changes in       \ninterest rates of the fair value of the MSR   \nportfolio and the related derivative          \ninstruments was as follows:                   \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nThe fair value of MSRs and their sensitivity  \nto changes in interest rates is influenced by \nthe mix of the servicing portfolio and        \ncharacteristics of each segment of the        \nportfolio.

As of           \nSeptember\u00a030, 2023, federal tax examinations  \nfor all years ending through December\u00a031, 2016\nare completed and resolved.

The   \nCompany recognizes all derivatives on the     \nConsolidated Balance Sheet at fair value in   \nother assets or in other liabilities. On the  \ndate the Company enters into a derivative     \ncontract, the derivative is designated as     \neither a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge,   \nnet investment hedge, or a designation is not \nmade as it is a customer-related transaction, \nan economic hedge for asset/liability risk    \nmanagement purposes or another stand-alone    \nderivative created through the Company\u2019s      \noperations (\u201cfree-standing derivative\u201d). When \na derivative is designated as a fair value,   \ncash flow or net investment hedge, the Company\nperforms an assessment, at inception and, at a\nminimum, quarterly thereafter, to determine   \nthe effectiveness of the derivative in        \noffsetting changes in the value or cash flows \nof the hedged item(s).                        \nFair Value Hedges These derivatives are       \ninterest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge \nthe change in fair value related to interest  \nrate changes of its underlying available-for- \nsaleinvestment securities and fixed-rate debt.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives      \ndesignated as fair value hedges, and changes  \nin the fair value of the hedged items, are    \nrecorded in earnings.                         \nCash Flow Hedges These derivatives are        \ninterest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge \nthe forecasted cash flows from its underlying \nvariable-rate loans and debt. Changes in the  \nfair value of derivatives designated as cash  \nflow hedges are recorded in other             \ncomprehensive income (loss) until the cash    \nflows of the hedged items are realized. If a  \nderivative designated as a cash flow hedge is \nterminated or ceases to be highly effective,  \nthe gain or loss in other comprehensive income\n(loss) is amortized to earnings over the      \nperiod the forecasted hedged transactions     \nimpact earnings. If a hedged forecasted       \ntransaction is no longer probable, hedge      \naccounting is ceased and any gain or loss     \nincluded in other comprehensive income (loss) \nis reported in earnings immediately, unless   \nthe forecasted transaction is at least        \nreasonably possible of occurring, whereby the \namounts remain within other comprehensive     \nincome (loss). At September 30, 2023, the     \nCompany had $ 533million (net-of-tax)of       \nrealized and unrealized losses on derivatives \nclassified as cash flow hedges recorded in    \nother comprehensive income (loss), compared   \nwith $ 114million (net-of-tax)of realized and \nunrealized losses at December 31, 2022. The   \nestimated amount to be reclassified from other\ncomprehensive income (loss) into earnings     \nduring the next 12 months is a loss of $      \n182million (net-of-tax).All cash flow hedges  \nwere highly effective for the three months    \nended September 30, 2023.                     \nNet Investment Hedges The Company uses forward\ncommitments to sell specified amounts of      \ncertain foreign currencies, and non-          \nderivativedebt instruments, to hedge the      \nvolatility of its net investment in foreign   \noperations driven by fluctuations in foreign  \ncurrency exchange rates. The carrying amount  \nof non-derivativedebt instruments designated  \nas net investment hedges was $ 1.2billion at  \nSeptember 30, 2023 and $ 1.3billion at        \nDecember 31, 2022.                            \nOther Derivative Positions The Company enters \ninto free-standing derivatives to mitigate    \ninterest rate risk and for other risk         \nmanagement purposes. These derivatives include\nforward commitments to sell to-be-            \nannouncedsecurities (\u201cTBAs\u201d) and other        \ncommitments to sell residential mortgage      \nloans, which are used to economically hedge   \nthe interest rate risk related to mortgage    \nloans held for sale (\u201cMLHFS\u201d) and unfunded    \nmortgage loan commitments. The Company also   \nenters into interest rate swaps, swaptions,   \nforward commitments to buy TBAs, U.S. Treasury\nand Eurodollar futures and options on U.S.    \nTreasury futures to economically hedge the    \nchange in the fair value of the Company\u2019s     \nMSRs. The Company enters into foreign currency\nforwards to economically hedge remeasurement  \ngains and losses the Company recognizes on    \nforeign currency denominated assets and       \nliabilities. The Company also enters into     \ninterest rate swaps as economic hedges of fair\nvalue option elected deposits. In addition,   \nthe Company acts as a seller and buyer of     \ninterest rate ,foreign exchange and           \ncommoditycontracts for its customers. The     \nCompany mitigates the market and liquidity    \nrisk associated with these customer           \nderivatives by entering into similar          \noffsetting positions with broker-dealers, or  \non a portfolio basis by entering into other   \nderivative or non-derivativefinancial         \ninstruments that partially or fully offset the\nexposure to earnings from these customer-     \nrelated positions. The Company\u2019s customer     \nderivatives and related hedges are monitored  \nand reviewed by the Company\u2019s Market Risk     \nCommittee, which establishes policies for     \nmarket risk management, including exposure    \nlimits for each portfolio. The Company also   \nhas derivative contracts that are created     \nthrough its operations, including certain     \nunfunded mortgage loan commitments and swap   \nagreements related to the sale of a portion of\nits Class B common and preferred shares of    \nVisa Inc. Refer to Note 15 for further        \ninformation on these swap agreements.

Collateral arrangements generally   \nrequire the counterparty to deliver collateral\n(typically cash or U.S. Treasury and agency   \nsecurities) equal to the Company\u2019s net        \nderivative receivable, subject to minimum     \ntransfer and credit rating requirements.      \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s collateral arrangements are     \npredominately bilateral and, therefore,       \ncontain provisions that require               \ncollateralization of the Company\u2019s net        \nliability derivative positions. Required      \ncollateral coverage is based on net liability \nthresholds and may be contingent upon the     \nCompany\u2019s credit rating from two of the       \nnationally recognized statistical rating      \norganizations. If the Company\u2019s credit rating \nwere to fall below credit ratings thresholds  \nestablished in the collateral arrangements,   \nthe counterparties to the derivatives could   \nrequest immediate additional collateral       \ncoverage up to and including full collateral  \ncoverage for derivatives in a net liability   \nposition. The aggregate fair value of all     \nderivatives under collateral arrangements that\nwere in a net liability position at           \nSeptember\u00a030, 2023, was $ 3.5 billion. At     \nSeptember\u00a030, 2023, the Company had $ 3.0     \nbillion of cash posted as collateral against  \nthis net liability position.                  \n                                              \n             Netting Arrangements for         \n  Note\u200914    Certain Financial Instruments    \n             and Securities Financing         \n             Activities                       \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s derivative portfolio consists of\nbilateral over-the-counter trades, certain    \ninterest rate derivatives and credit contracts\nrequired to be centrally cleared through      \nclearinghouses per current regulations, and   \nexchange-traded positions which may include   \nU.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures or       \noptions on U.S. Treasury futures. Of the      \nCompany\u2019s $ 1.2 trillion total notional amount\nof derivative positions at September\u00a030, 2023,\n$ 554.9 billion related to bilateral over-the-\ncounter trades, $ 648.8 billion related to    \nthose centrally cleared through clearinghouses\nand $ 1.8 billion related to those that were  \nexchange-traded. The Company\u2019s derivative     \ncontracts typically include offsetting rights \n(referred to as netting arrangements), and    \ndepending on expected volume, credit risk, and\ncounterparty preference, collateral           \nmaintenance may be required. For all          \nderivatives under collateral support          \narrangements, fair value is determined daily  \nand, depending on the collateral maintenance  \nrequirements, the Company and a counterparty  \nmay receive or deliver collateral, based upon \nthe net fair value of all derivative positions\nbetween the Company and the                   \n                      \n  64    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\ncounterparty. Collateral is typically cash,   \nbut securities may be allowed under collateral\narrangements with certain counterparties.     \nReceivables and payables related to cash      \ncollateral are included in other assets and   \nother liabilities on the Consolidated Balance \nSheet, along with the related derivative asset\nand liability fair values. Any securities     \npledged to counterparties as collateral remain\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities \nreceived from counterparties as collateral are\nnot recognized on the Consolidated Balance    \nSheet, unless the counterparty defaults. In   \ngeneral, securities used as collateral can be \nsold, repledged or otherwise used by the party\nin possession. No restrictions exist on the   \nuse of cash collateral by either party. Refer \nto Note 13 for further discussion of the      \nCompany\u2019s derivatives, including collateral   \narrangements.                                 \n                                              \nAs part of the Company\u2019s treasury and broker- \ndealer operations, the Company executes       \ntransactions that are treated as securities   \nsold under agreements to repurchase or        \nsecurities purchased under agreements to      \nresell, both of which are accounted for as    \ncollateralized financings. Securities sold    \nunder agreements to repurchase include        \nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned   \ntransactions. Securities purchased under      \nagreements to resell include reverse          \nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed \ntransactions. For securities sold under       \nagreements to repurchase, the Company records \na liability for the cash received, which is   \nincluded in short-term borrowings on the      \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. For securities    \npurchased under agreements to resell, the     \nCompany records a receivable for the cash     \npaid, which is included in other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.                   \n                                              \nSecurities transferred to counterparties under\nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned   \ntransactions continue to be recognized on the \nConsolidated Balance Sheet, are measured at   \nfair value, and are included in investment    \nsecurities or other assets. Securities        \nreceived from counterparties under reverse    \nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed \ntransactions are not recognized on the        \nConsolidated Balance Sheet unless the         \ncounterparty defaults. The securities         \ntransferred under repurchase and reverse      \nrepurchase transactions typically are U.S.    \nTreasury and agency securities, residential   \nagency mortgage-backed securities or corporate\ndebt securities. The securities loaned or     \nborrowed typically are corporate debt         \nsecurities traded by the Company\u2019s primary    \nbroker-dealer subsidiary. In general, the     \nsecurities transferred can be sold, repledged \nor otherwise used by the party in possession. \nNo restrictions exist on the use of cash      \ncollateral by either party. Repurchase/reverse\nrepurchase and securities loaned/borrowed     \ntransactions expose the Company to            \ncounterparty risk. The Company manages this   \nrisk by performing assessments, independent of\nbusiness line managers, and establishing      \nconcentration limits on each counterparty.    \nAdditionally, these transactions include      \ncollateral arrangements that require the fair \nvalues of the underlying securities to be     \ndetermined daily, resulting in cash being     \nobtained or refunded to counterparties to     \nmaintain specified collateral levels.         \nThe following table summarizes the maturities \nby category of collateral pledged for         \nrepurchase agreements and

These nonrecurring fair \nvalue adjustments typically involve           \napplication of lower-of-cost-or-fair value    \naccounting or impairment write-downs of       \nindividual assets. Other financial            \ninstruments, such as held-to-maturity         \ninvestment securities, loans, the majority of \ntime deposits, short-term borrowings and long-\nterm debt, are accounted for at amortized     \ncost. See \u201cFair Value of Financial            \nInstruments\u201d in this Note for further         \ninformation on the estimated fair value of    \nthese other financial instruments. In         \naccordance with disclosure guidance, certain  \nfinancial instruments, such as deposits with  \nno defined or contractual maturity,           \nreceivables and payables due in one year or   \nless, insurance contracts and equity          \ninvestments not accounted for at fair value,  \nare excluded from this Note.                  \nFair value is defined as the exchange price   \nthat would be received for an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability (an exit price) in the   \nprincipal or most advantageous market for the \nasset or liability in an orderly transaction  \nbetween market participants on the measurement\ndate. A fair value measurement reflects all of\nthe assumptions that market participants would\nuse in pricing the asset or liability,        \nincluding assumptions about the risk inherent \nin a particular valuation technique, the      \neffect of a restriction on the sale or use of \nan asset and the risk of nonperformance.      \nThe Company groups its assets and liabilities \nmeasured at fair value into a three-level     \nhierarchy for valuation techniques used to    \nmeasure financial assets and financial        \nliabilities at fair value. This hierarchy is  \nbased on whether the valuation inputs are     \nobservable or unobservable. These levels are: \n                                              \n       Level\u00a01 \u2014 Quoted prices in active      \n       markets for identical assets or        \n  \u2022    liabilities.

Level\u00a03 assets and        \n       liabilities include financial          \n       instruments whose values are           \n  \u2022    determined using pricing models,       \n       discounted cash flow methodologies,    \n       or similar techniques, as well as      \n       instruments for which the              \n       determination of fair value requires   \n       significant management judgment or     \n       estimation. This category includes     \n       MSRs and certain derivative            \n       contracts.                             \n                                              \nValuation Methodologies                       \nThe valuation methodologies used by the       \nCompany to measure financial assets and       \nliabilities at fair value are described below.\nIn addition, the following section includes an\nindication of the level of the fair value     \nhierarchy in which the assets or liabilities  \nare classified. Where appropriate, the        \ndescriptions include information about the    \nvaluation models and key inputs to those      \nmodels. During the nine months ended          \nSeptember\u00a030, 2023 and 2022, there were no    \nsignificant changes to the valuation          \ntechniques used by the Company to measure fair\nvalue.                                        \nAvailable-For-SaleInvestment Securities When  \nquoted market prices for identical securities \nare available in an active market, these      \nprices are used to determine fair value and   \nthese securities are classified within Level 1\nof the fair value hierarchy. Level 1          \ninvestment securities include U.S. Treasury   \nand exchange-traded securities.               \nFor other securities, quoted market prices may\nnot be readily available for the specific     \nsecurities. When possible, the Company        \ndetermines fair value based on market         \nobservable information, including quoted      \nmarket prices for similar securities, inactive\ntransaction prices, and broker quotes. These  \nsecurities are classified within Level\u00a02 of   \nthe fair value hierarchy. Level\u00a02 valuations  \nare generally provided by a third-party       \npricing service. Level\u00a02 investment securities\nare predominantly agency mortgage-backed      \nsecurities, certain other asset-backed        \nsecurities, obligations of state and political\nsubdivisions and agency debt securities.      \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    67  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nMortgage Loans Held For Sale MLHFS measured at\nfair value, for which an active secondary     \nmarket and readily available market prices    \nexist, are initially valued at the transaction\nprice and are subsequently valued by          \ncomparison to instruments with similar        \ncollateral and risk profiles. MLHFS are       \nclassified within Level 2. Included in        \nmortgage banking revenue were net losses of $ \n28million and $ 144million for the three      \nmonths ended September 30, 2023 and 2022,     \nrespectively, and net losses of $ 61million   \nand $ 442million for the nine months ended    \nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively,    \nfrom the changes to fair value of these MLHFS \nunder fair value option accounting guidance.  \nChanges in fair value due to instrument       \nspecific credit risk were immaterial. Interest\nincome for MLHFS is measured based on         \ncontractual interest rates and reported as    \ninterest income on the Consolidated Statement \nof Income. Electing to measure MLHFS at fair  \nvalue reduces certain timing differences and  \nbetter matches changes in fair value of these \nassets with changes in the value of the       \nderivative instruments used to economically   \nhedge them without the burden of complying    \nwith the requirements for hedge accounting.   \n                                              \nTime Deposits The Company elects the fair     \nvalue option to account for certain time      \ndeposits that are hedged with derivatives that\ndo not qualify for hedge accounting. Electing \nto measure these time deposits at fair value  \nreduces certain timing differences and better \nmatches changes in fair value of these        \ndeposits with changes in the value of the     \nderivative instruments used to economically   \nhedge them. The time deposits measured at fair\nvalue are valued using a discounted cash flow \nmodel that utilizes market observable inputs  \nand are classified within Level 2. Included in\ninterest expense on deposits were net gains of\n$ 1million for the three months and nine      \nmonths ended September 30, 2023 from the      \nchanges in fair value of time deposits under  \nfair value option accounting guidance.        \n                                              \nMortgage Servicing Rights MSRs are valued     \nusing a discounted cash flow methodology, and \nare classified within Level 3. The Company    \ndetermines fair value of the MSRs by          \nprojecting future cash flows for different    \ninterest rate scenarios using prepayment rates\nand other assumptions, and discounts these    \ncash flows using a risk adjusted rate based on\noption adjusted spread levels. There is       \nminimal observable market activity for MSRs on\ncomparable portfolios and, therefore, the     \ndetermination of fair value requires          \nsignificant management judgment. Refer to Note\n7 for further information on MSR valuation    \nassumptions.                                  \n                                              \nDerivatives The majority of derivatives held  \nby the Company are executed over-the-counteror\ncentrally cleared through clearinghouses and  \nare valued using market standard cash flow    \nvaluation techniques. The models incorporate  \ninputs, depending on the type of derivative,  \nincluding interest rate curves, foreign       \nexchange rates and volatility. All derivative \nvalues incorporate an assessment of the risk  \nof counterparty nonperformance, measured based\non the Company\u2019s evaluation of credit risk    \nincluding external assessments of credit risk.\nThe Company monitors and manages its          \nnonperformance risk by considering its ability\nto net derivative positions under master      \nnetting arrangements, as well as collateral   \nreceived or provided under collateral         \narrangements. Accordingly, the Company has    \nelected to measure the fair value of          \nderivatives, at a counterparty level, on a net\nbasis. The majority of the derivatives are    \nclassified within Level 2 of the fair value   \nhierarchy, as the significant inputs to the   \nmodels, including nonperformance risk, are    \nobservable. However, certain derivative       \ntransactions are with counterparties where    \nrisk of nonperformance cannot be observed in  \nthe market and, therefore, the credit         \nvaluation adjustments result in these         \nderivatives being classified within Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy.                     \n                                              \nThe Company also has other derivative         \ncontracts that are created through its        \noperations, including commitments to purchase \nand originate mortgage loans and swap         \nagreements executed in conjunction with the   \nsale of a portion of its Class\u00a0B common and   \npreferred shares of Visa Inc. (the \u201cVisa      \nswaps\u201d). The mortgage loan commitments are    \nvalued by pricing models that include market  \nobservable and unobservable inputs, which     \nresult in the commitments being classified    \nwithin Level\u00a03 of the fair value hierarchy.   \nThe unobservable inputs include assumptions   \nabout the percentage of commitments that      \nactually become a closed loan and the MSR     \nvalue that is inherent in the underlying loan \nvalue. The Visa swaps require payments by     \neither the Company or the purchaser of the    \nVisa Inc. Class\u00a0B common and preferred shares \nwhen there are changes in the conversion rate \nof the Visa Inc. Class\u00a0B common and preferred \nshares to Visa Inc. Class\u00a0A common and        \npreferred shares, respectively, as well as    \nquarterly payments to the purchaser based on  \nspecified terms of the agreements. Management \nreviews and updates the Visa swaps fair value \nin conjunction with its review of Visa Inc.   \nrelated litigation contingencies, and the     \nassociated escrow funding. The expected       \nlitigation resolution impacts the Visa Inc.   \nClass\u00a0B common share to Visa Inc. Class\u00a0A     \ncommon share conversion rate, as well as the  \nultimate termination date for the Visa swaps. \nAccordingly, the Visa swaps are classified    \nwithin Level\u00a03. Refer to Note 16 for further  \ninformation on the Visa Inc. restructuring and\nrelated card association litigation.          \n                                              \nSignificant Unobservable Inputs of Level 3    \nAssets and Liabilities                        \n                                              \nThe following section provides information to \nfacilitate an understanding of the uncertainty\nin the fair value measurements for the        \nCompany\u2019s Level\u00a03 assets and liabilities      \nrecorded at fair value on the Consolidated    \nBalance Sheet.                                \n                      \n  68    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThis section includes a description of the    \nsignificant inputs used by the Company and a  \ndescription of any interrelationships between \nthese inputs. The discussion below excludes   \nnonrecurring fair value measurements of       \ncollateral value used for impairment measures \nfor loans and OREO. These valuations utilize  \nthird party appraisal or broker price         \nopinions, and are classified as Level\u00a03 due to\nthe significant judgment involved.            \n                                              \nMortgage Servicing Rights The significant     \nunobservable inputs used in the fair value    \nmeasurement of the Company\u2019s MSRs are expected\nprepayments and the option adjusted spread    \nthat is added to the risk-free rate to        \ndiscount projected cash flows. Significant    \nincreases in either of these inputs in        \nisolation would have resulted in a            \nsignificantly lower fair value measurement.   \nSignificant decreases in either of these      \ninputs in isolation would have resulted in a  \nsignificantly higher fair value measurement.  \nThere is no direct interrelationship between  \nprepayments and option adjusted spread.       \nPrepayment rates generally move in the        \nopposite direction of market interest rates.  \nOption adjusted spread is generally impacted  \nby changes in market return requirements.     \nThe following table shows the significant     \nvaluation assumption ranges for MSRs at       \nSeptember\u00a030, 2023:                           \n                                              \n                                   Weigh\u2026     \n          Minim\u2026       Maxi\u2026       Avera\u2026     \n                                      (a)     \n  Exp\u2026         6  %       16  %         8  %  \n  pre\u2026                                        \n  Opt\u2026                                        \n  adj\u2026         4          11            5     \n  spr\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Determined based on the relative fair  \n  (a)  value of the related mortgage loans    \n       serviced.                              \n                                              \nDerivatives The Company has two distinct Level\n3 derivative portfolios: (i) the Company\u2019s    \ncommitments to purchase and originate mortgage\nloans that meet the requirements of a         \nderivative and (ii) the Company\u2019s             \nasset/liability and customer-related          \nderivatives that are Level 3 due to           \nunobservable inputs related to measurement of \nrisk of nonperformance by the counterparty. In\naddition, the Company\u2019s Visa swaps are        \nclassified within Level 3.                    \n                                              \nThe significant unobservable inputs used in   \nthe fair value measurement of the Company\u2019s   \nderivative commitments to purchase and        \noriginate mortgage loans are the percentage of\ncommitments that actually become a closed loan\nand the MSR value that is inherent in the     \nunderlying loan value. A significant increase \nin the rate of loans that close would have    \nresulted in a larger derivative asset or      \nliability. A significant increase in the      \ninherent MSR value would have resulted in an  \nincrease in the derivative asset or a         \nreduction in the derivative liability.        \nExpected loan close rates and the inherent MSR\nvalues are directly impacted by changes in    \nmarket rates and will generally move in the   \nsame direction as interest rates.             \nThe following table shows the significant     \nvaluation assumption ranges for the Company\u2019s \nderivative commitments to purchase and        \noriginate mortgage loans at September\u00a030,     \n2023:                                         \n                                              \n                                   Weigh\u2026     \n          Minim\u2026       Maxi\u2026       Avera\u2026     \n                                      (a)     \n  Exp\u2026                                        \n  loan        35  %      100  %        79  %  \n  clo\u2026                                        \n  rate                                        \n  Inh\u2026                                        \n  MSR                                         \n  val\u2026                                        \n  (ba\u2026        58         194          118     \n  poi\u2026                                        \n  per                                         \n  loa\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  (a)  Determined based on the relative fair  \n       value of the related mortgage loans.   \n                                              \nThe significant unobservable input used in the\nfair value measurement of certain of the      \nCompany\u2019s asset/liability and customer-related\nderivatives is the credit valuation adjustment\nrelated to the risk of counterparty           \nnonperformance. A significant increase in the \ncredit valuation adjustment would have        \nresulted in a lower fair value measurement. A \nsignificant decrease in the credit valuation  \nadjustment would have resulted in a higher    \nfair value measurement. The credit valuation  \nadjustment is impacted by changes in market   \nrates, volatility, market implied credit      \nspreads, and loss recovery rates, as well as  \nthe Company\u2019s assessment of the counterparty\u2019s\ncredit position. At September\u00a030, 2023, the   \nminimum, maximum and weighted-average credit  \nvaluation adjustment as a percentage of the   \nnet fair value of the counterparty\u2019s          \nderivative contracts prior to adjustment was 0\npercent, 3,348 percent and 4 percent,         \nrespectively.                                 \n                                              \nThe significant unobservable inputs used in   \nthe fair value measurement of the Visa swaps  \nare management\u2019s estimate of the probability  \nof certain litigation scenarios occurring, and\nthe timing of the resolution of the related   \nlitigation loss estimates in excess, or       \nshortfall, of the Company\u2019s proportional share\nof escrow funds. An increase in the loss      \nestimate or a delay in the resolution of the  \nrelated litigation would have resulted in an  \nincrease in the derivative liability. A       \ndecrease in the loss estimate or an           \nacceleration of the resolution of the related \nlitigation would have resulted in a decrease  \nin the derivative liability.                  \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    69  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the balances of\nassets and liabilities measured at fair value \non a recurring basis:                         \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                    \n         1       2       3       \u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014       $    \n                                              \n         \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014            \n                                              \n         \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014            \n         \u2014       6       \u2014       \u2014            \n         \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014            \n         \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014            \n         \u2014       4       \u2014       \u2014            \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014            \n         \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014            \n         \u2014       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014            \n         4       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  )         \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014            \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026  )    $    \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014       $    \n         \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  )         \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014            \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026  )    $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014       $    \n                                              \n         \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014            \n                                              \n         \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014            \n         \u2014       7       \u2014       \u2014            \n         \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014            \n         \u2014       \u2026       1       \u2014            \n         \u2014       6       \u2014       \u2014            \n         \u2026       \u2026       1       \u2014            \n         \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014            \n         \u2014       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014            \n         9       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  )         \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014            \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026  )    $    \n      $  4    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026  )    $    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014            \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026  )    $    \n                                              \n                                              \n         Excluded from the table above are    \n         equity investments without readily   \n         determinable fair values.

Inc. card association \nor its affiliates (collectively \u201cVisa\u201d). In   \n2007, Visa completed a restructuring and      \nissued shares of Visa Inc. common stock to its\nfinancial institution members in contemplation\nof its initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d)        \ncompleted in the first quarter of 2008 (the   \n\u201cVisa Reorganization\u201d). As a part of the Visa \nReorganization, the Company received its      \nproportionate number of shares of Visa Inc.   \ncommon stock, which were subsequently         \nconverted to Class B shares of Visa Inc.      \n(\u201cClass B shares\u201d).                           \nVisa U.S.A. Inc. (\u201cVisa U.S.A.\u201d) and          \nMasterCard International (collectively, the   \n\u201cCard Brands\u201d) are defendants in antitrust    \nlawsuits challenging the practices of the Card\nBrands (the \u201cVisa Litigation\u201d). Visa U.S.A.   \nmember banks have a contingent obligation to  \nindemnify Visa Inc. under the Visa U.S.A.     \nbylaws (which were modified at the time of the\nrestructuring in October 2007) for potential  \nlosses arising from the Visa Litigation. The  \nindemnification by the Visa U.S.A. member     \nbanks has no specific maximum amount. Using   \nproceeds from its IPO and through reductions  \nto the conversion ratio applicable to the     \nClass\u00a0B shares held by Visa U.S.A. member     \nbanks, Visa Inc. has funded an escrow account \nfor the benefit of member financial           \ninstitutions to fund their indemnification    \nobligations associated with the Visa          \nLitigation. The receivable related to the     \nescrow account is classified in other         \nliabilities as a direct offset to the related \nVisa Litigation contingent liability.         \nIn October 2012, Visa signed a settlement     \nagreement to resolve class action claims      \nassociated with the multidistrict interchange \nlitigation pending in the United States       \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork (the \u201cMulti-District Litigation\u201d). The   \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit  \nreversed the approval of that settlement and  \nremanded the matter to the district court.    \nThereafter, the case was split into two       \nputative class actions, one seeking damages   \n(the \u201cDamages Action\u201d) and a separate class   \naction seeking injunctive relief only (the    \n\u201cInjunctive Action\u201d). In September 2018, Visa \nsigned a new settlement agreement, superseding\nthe original settlement agreement, to resolve \nthe Damages Action. The Damages Action        \nsettlement has received final court approval  \nand is now resolved. The Injunctive Action,   \nwhich generally seeks changes to Visa rules,  \nis still pending.                             \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    73  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nOther Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities   \nThe following table is a summary of other     \nguarantees and contingent liabilities of the  \nCompany at September\u00a030, 2023:                \n                                              \n                                   Maxi\u2026      \n  (D\u2026                              Pote\u2026      \n  in        Coll\u2026       Car\u2026       Futu\u2026      \n  Mi\u2026        Held       Amo\u2026       Paym\u2026      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  St\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026    $      \u2014    $    22    $  10,7\u2026      \n  of                                          \n  cr\u2026                                         \n  Th\u2026                                         \n  pa\u2026           \u2014          \u2014          11      \n  bo\u2026                                         \n  ar\u2026                                         \n  Se\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026       8,360          \u2014       8,123      \n  in\u2026                                         \n  As\u2026           \u2014         99       8,631  -a  \n  sa\u2026                                         \n  Me\u2026         883         82       148,\u2026      \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  Te\u2026                                         \n  op\u2026                                         \n  bo\u2026         941          \u2014         997      \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  gu\u2026                                         \n  Ot\u2026           \u2014         21       1,947      \n                                              \n                                              \n       The maximum potential future payments  \n       do not include loan sales where the    \n       Company provides standard              \n       representation and warranties to the   \n       buyer against losses related to loan   \n       underwriting documentation defects     \n       that may have existed at the time of   \n       sale that generally are identified     \n       after the occurrence of a triggering   \n       event such as delinquency. For these   \n  (a)  types of loan sales, the maximum       \n       potential future payments is           \n       generally the unpaid principal         \n       balance of loans sold measured at the  \n       end of the current reporting period.   \n       Actual losses will be significantly    \n       less than the maximum exposure, as     \n       only a fraction of loans sold will     \n       have a representation and warranty     \n       breach, and any losses on repurchase   \n       would generally be mitigated by any    \n       collateral held against the loans.     \n                                              \nMerchant Processing The Company, through its  \nsubsidiaries, provides merchant processing    \nservices. Under the rules of credit card      \nassociations, a merchant processor retains a  \ncontingent liability for credit card          \ntransactions processed. This contingent       \nliability arises in the event of a billing    \ndispute between the merchant and a cardholder \nthat is ultimately resolved in the            \ncardholder\u2019s favor. In this situation, the    \ntransaction is \u201ccharged-back\u201d to the merchant \nand the disputed amount is credited or        \notherwise refunded to the cardholder. If the  \nCompany is unable to collect this amount from \nthe merchant, it bears the loss for the amount\nof the refund paid to the cardholder.         \n                                              \nThe Company currently processes card          \ntransactions in the United States, Canada and \nEurope through wholly-owned subsidiaries. In  \nthe event a merchant was unable to fulfill    \nproduct or services subject to future         \ndelivery, such as airline tickets, the Company\ncould become financially liable for refunding \nthe purchase price of such products or        \nservices purchased through the credit card    \nassociations under the charge-back provisions.\nCharge-back risk related to these merchants is\nevaluated in a manner similar to credit risk  \nassessments and, as such, merchant processing \ncontracts contain various provisions to       \nprotect the Company in the event of default.  \nAt September\u00a030, 2023, the value of airline   \ntickets purchased to be delivered at a future \ndate through card transactions processed by   \nthe Company was $ 12.9 billion. The Company   \nheld collateral of $ 736 million in escrow    \ndeposits, letters of credit and indemnities   \nfrom financial institutions, and liens on     \nvarious assets. In addition to specific       \ncollateral or other credit enhancements, the  \nCompany maintains a liability for its implied \nguarantees associated with future delivery. At\nSeptember\u00a030, 2023, the liability was $ 60    \nmillion primarily related to these airline    \nprocessing arrangements.                      \n                                              \nAsset Sales The Company regularly sells loans \nto GSEs as part of its mortgage banking       \nactivities. The Company provides customary    \nrepresentations and warranties to GSEs in     \nconjunction with these sales. These           \nrepresentations and warranties generally      \nrequire the Company to repurchase assets if it\nis subsequently determined that a loan did not\nmeet specified criteria, such as a            \ndocumentation deficiency or rescission of     \nmortgage insurance. If the Company is unable  \nto cure or refute a repurchase request, the   \nCompany is generally obligated to repurchase  \nthe loan or otherwise reimburse the GSE for   \nlosses. At September 30, 2023, the Company had\nreserved $ 14million for potential losses from\nrepresentation and warranty obligations,      \ncompared with $ 17million at December 31,     \n2022. The Company\u2019s reserve reflects          \nmanagement\u2019s best estimate of losses for      \nrepresentation and warranty obligations. The  \nCompany\u2019s repurchase reserve is modeled at the\nloan level, taking into consideration the     \nindividual credit quality and borrower        \nactivity that has transpired since            \norigination. The model applies credit quality \nand economic risk factors to derive a         \nprobability of default and potential          \nrepurchase that are based on the Company\u2019s    \nhistorical loss experience, and estimates loss\nseverity based on expected collateral value.  \nThe Company also considers qualitative factors\nthat may result in anticipated losses         \ndiffering from historical loss trends.        \n                                              \nAs of September\u00a030, 2023 and December\u00a031,     \n2022, the Company had $ 15 million and $ 39   \nmillion, respectively, of unresolved          \nrepresentation and warranty claims from GSEs. \nThe Company does not have a significant amount\nof unresolved claims from investors other than\nGSEs.                                         \n                                              \nLitigation and Regulatory Matters             \n                                              \nThe Company is subject to various litigation  \nand regulatory matters that arise in the      \nordinary course of its business. The Company  \nestablishes reserves for such matters when    \npotential losses become probable and can be   \nreasonably                                    \n                      \n  74    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nTable of Contents\nestimated. The Company believes the ultimate  \nresolution of existing legal and regulatory   \nmatters will not have a material adverse      \neffect on the financial condition, results of \noperations or cash flows of the Company.      \nHowever, in light of the uncertainties        \ninherent in these matters, it is possible that\nthe ultimate resolution of one or more of     \nthese matters may have a material adverse     \neffect on the Company\u2019s results from          \noperations for a particular period, and future\nchanges in circumstances or additional        \ninformation could result in additional        \naccruals or resolution in excess of           \nestablished accruals, which could adversely   \naffect the Company\u2019s results from operations, \npotentially materially. Residential Mortgage- \nBacked Securities Litigation Starting in 2011,\nthe Company and other large financial         \ninstitutions have been sued in their capacity \nas trustee for residential mortgage\u2013backed    \nsecurities trusts for losses arising out of   \nthe 2008 financial crisis. In the lawsuits    \nbrought against the Company, the investors and\na monoline insurer allege that the Company\u2019s  \nbanking subsidiary, U.S. Bank National        \nAssociation (\u201cUSBNA\u201d), as trustee caused them \nto incur substantial losses by failing to     \nenforce loan repurchase obligations and       \nfailing to abide by appropriate standards of  \ncare after events of default allegedly        \noccurred. The plaintiffs in these matters seek\nmonetary damages in unspecified amounts and   \nmost also seek equitable relief. Regulatory   \nMatters The Company is continually subject to \nexaminations, inquiries and investigations in \nareas of heightened regulatory scrutiny, such \nas compliance, risk management, third-party   \nrisk management and consumer protection. For  \nexample, as part of an industry-wide inquiry, \ncertain broker-dealer, registered investment  \nadvisor, and swap dealer subsidiaries of the  \nCompany received from the Securities and      \nExchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and Commodity     \nFutures Trading Commission requests for       \ninformation concerning compliance with record \nretention requirements relating to electronic \nbusiness communications. The Company is in    \nresolution discussions with the SEC, although \nthere can be no assurance as to the outcome of\nthese discussions. Also, the Consumer         \nFinancial Protection Bureau and another       \nfederal regulator have been investigating the \nCompany\u2019s administration of unemployment      \ninsurance benefit prepaid debit cards during  \nthe pandemic timeframe and are considering    \npotential enforcement actions. The Company is \ncooperating fully with all pending            \nexaminations, inquiries and investigations,   \nany of which could lead to administrative or  \nlegal proceedings or settlements. Remedies in \nthese proceedings or settlements may include  \nfines, penalties, restitution or alterations  \nin the Company\u2019s business practices (which may\nincrease the Company\u2019s operating expenses and \ndecrease its revenue). Outlook Due to their   \ncomplex nature, it can be years before        \nlitigation and regulatory matters are         \nresolved. The Company may be unable to develop\nan estimate or range of loss where matters are\nin early stages, there are significant factual\nor legal issues to be resolved, damages are   \nunspecified or uncertain, or there is         \nuncertainty as to a litigation class being    \ncertified or the outcome of pending motions,  \nappeals or proceedings. For those litigation  \nand regulatory matters where the Company has  \ninformation to develop an estimate or range of\nloss, the Company believes the upper end of   \nthe range of reasonably possible losses in    \naggregate, in excess of any reserves          \nestablished for matters where a loss is       \nconsidered probable, will not be material to  \nits financial condition, results of operations\nor cash flows. The Company\u2019s estimates are    \nsubject to significant judgment and           \nuncertainties, and the matters underlying the \nestimates will change from time to time.      \nActual results may vary significantly from the\ncurrent estimates.                            \n                                 \n  Note\u00a0\u200917    Business Segments  \n                                 \nWithin the Company, financial performance is  \nmeasured by major lines of business based on  \nthe products and services provided to         \ncustomers through its distribution channels.  \nThese operating segments are components of the\nCompany about which financial information is  \nprepared and is evaluated regularly by        \nmanagement in deciding how to allocate        \nresources and assess performance.

The allowance\nfor credit losses and related provision       \nexpense are allocated to the business segments\naccording to the volume and credit quality of \nthe loan balances managed, but with the impact\nof changes in economic forecasts recorded in  \nTreasury and Corporate Support. Goodwill and  \nother intangible assets are assigned to the   \nbusiness segments based on the mix of business\nof an entity acquired by the Company. Within  \nthe Company, capital levels are evaluated and \nmanaged centrally; however, capital is        \nallocated to the business segments to support \nevaluation of business performance. Business  \nsegments are allocated capital on a risk-     \nadjusted basis considering economic and       \nregulatory capital requirements. Generally,   \nthe determination of the amount of capital    \nallocated to each business segment includes   \ncredit allocations following a Basel III      \nregulatory framework. Interest income and     \nexpense is determined based on the assets and \nliabilities managed by the business segment.  \nBecause funding and asset/liability management\nis a central function, funds transfer-pricing \nmethodologies are utilized to allocate a cost \nof funds used or credit for funds provided to \nall business segment assets and liabilities,  \nrespectively, using a matched funding concept.\nAlso, each business unit is allocated the     \ntaxable-equivalent benefit of tax-            \nexemptproducts. The residual effect on net    \ninterest income of asset/liability management \nactivities is included in Treasury and        \nCorporate Support. Noninterest income and     \nexpenses directly managed by each business    \nsegment, including fees, service charges,     \nsalaries and benefits, and other direct       \nrevenues and costs are accounted for within   \neach segment\u2019s financial results in a manner  \nsimilar to the consolidated financial         \nstatements. Occupancy costs are allocated     \nbased on utilization of facilities by the     \nbusiness segments. Generally, operating losses\nare charged to the business segment when the  \nloss event is realized in a manner similar to \na loan charge-off.Noninterest expenses        \nincurred by centrally managed operations or   \nbusiness segments that directly support       \nanother business segment\u2019s operations are     \ncharged to the applicable business segment    \nbased on its utilization of those services,   \nprimarily measured by the volume of customer  \nactivities, number of employees or other      \nrelevant factors. These allocated expenses are\nreported as net shared services expense within\nnoninterest expense. Certain activities that  \ndo not directly support the operations of the \nbusiness segments or for which the business   \nsegments are not considered financially       \naccountable in evaluating their performance   \nare not charged to the business segments. The \nincome or expenses associated with these      \ncorporate activities, including merger and    \nintegration charges, are reported within the  \nTreasury and Corporate Support business       \nsegment. Income taxes are assessed to each    \nbusiness segment at a standard tax rate with  \nthe residual tax expense or benefit to arrive \nat the consolidated effective tax rate        \nincluded in Treasury and Corporate Support.   \n                                              \nDesignations, assignments and allocations     \nchange from time to time as management systems\nare enhanced, methods of evaluating           \nperformance or product lines change or        \nbusiness segments are realigned to better     \nrespond to the Company\u2019s diverse customer     \nbase.
