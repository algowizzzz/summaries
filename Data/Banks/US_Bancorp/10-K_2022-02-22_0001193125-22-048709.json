The        \nCOVID-19pandemic is adversely affecting U.S.  \nBancorp, its customers, counterparties,       \nemployees, and third-party service providers, \nand the ultimate extent of the impacts on its \nbusiness, financial position, results of      \noperations, liquidity, and prospects is       \nuncertain. Continued deterioration in general \nbusiness and economic conditions or turbulence\nin domestic or global financial markets could \nadversely affect U.S. Bancorp\u2019s revenues and  \nthe values of its assets and liabilities,     \nreduce the availability of funding to certain \nfinancial institutions, lead to a tightening  \nof credit, and increase stock price           \nvolatility. In addition, changes to statutes, \nregulations, or regulatory policies or        \npractices could affect U.S. Bancorp in        \nsubstantial and unpredictable ways. U.S.      \nBancorp\u2019s results could also be adversely     \naffected by changes in interest rates;        \nincreases in unemployment rates; deterioration\nin the credit quality of its loan portfolios  \nor in the value of the collateral securing    \nthose loans; deterioration in the value of its\ninvestment securities; legal and regulatory   \ndevelopments; litigation; increased           \ncompetition from both banks and non-          \nbanks;civil unrest; the effects of climate    \nchange; changes in customer behavior and      \npreferences; breaches in data security,       \nincluding as a result of work-from-home       \narrangements; failures to safeguard personal  \ninformation; effects of mergers and           \nacquisitions and related integration; effects \nof critical accounting policies and judgments;\nand management\u2019s ability to effectively manage\ncredit risk, market risk, operational risk,   \ncompliance risk, strategic risk, interest rate\nrisk, liquidity risk and reputation risk. In  \naddition, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s proposed acquisition \nof MUFG Union Bank presents risks and         \nuncertainties, including, among others; the   \nrisk that the cost savings, any revenue       \nsynergies and other anticipated benefits of   \nthe proposed acquisition may not be realized  \nor may take longer than anticipated to be     \nrealized; the risk that U.S. Bancorp\u2019s        \nbusiness could be disrupted as a result of the\nannouncement and pendency of the proposed     \nacquisition and diversion of management\u2019s     \nattention from ongoing business operations and\nopportunities; the possibility that the       \nproposed acquisition, including the           \nintegration of MUFG Union Bank, may be more   \ncostly or difficult to complete than          \nanticipated; delays in closing the proposed   \nacquisition; and the failure of required      \ngovernment approvals to be obtained or any    \nother closing conditions in the definitive    \npurchase agreement to be satisfied. For       \ndiscussion of these and other risks that may  \ncause actual results to differ from           \nexpectations, refer to the sections entitled  \n\u201cCorporate Risk Profile\u201d on pages 35 to 56 and\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d on pages 137 to 150 of the 2021\nAnnual Report. In addition, factors other than\nthese risks also could adversely affect U.S.  \nBancorp\u2019s results, and the reader should not  \nconsider these risks to be a complete set of  \nall potential risks or uncertainties.

In addition, as of December 31, 2021,  \nof the Company\u2019s 13 directors, 6 were women   \nand 4 were people of color. The Company\u2019s goal\nis to ensure diversity and inclusion          \naccountability is consistent across the       \norganization. To ensure accountability, the   \nCompany\u2019s chief executive officer (\u201cCEO\u201d)     \nchairs the Company\u2019s Diversity, Equity and    \nInclusion Committee, with the Company\u2019s Chief \nDiversity Officer reporting directly to the   \nCEO and serving as a member of the Managing   \nCommittee.                                    \n                                              \nEquitable and Competitive Compensation, Health\n& Wellness Programs Maintaining competitive   \ncompensation and benefits practices is a      \ncontinued focus for the Company, with periodic\npeer and benchmarking reviews used to assist  \nwith competitive alignment and employee       \nretention. The Company recognizes that        \ncomprehensive health and wellness benefits,   \ncompetitive retirement, leave, recognition,   \nflexible work programs, and education         \nassistance programs are important in the      \ncurrent talent market.                        \n                                              \nThe Company is also committed to fair pay and \ncontinues to prioritize pay equity efforts. To\nhelp ensure diverse employees are fairly      \ncompensated, the Company has processes in     \nplace to address any gender and racial pay    \ninequities identified within its workforce.   \nThis work starts with fair hiring practices,  \nas discussed above. The Company also has      \nguidelines in place for both internal and     \nexternal job postings to assist the Company\u2019s \nleaders in making fair compensation decisions \nbased on the demands and value of each role,  \ncandidate experience, and pay related to      \ncomparable internal positions. The Company    \nalso conducts periodic reviews of its         \nemployees\u2019 pay levels across gender and racial\ncategories with the assistance of an          \nindependent third-party consultant. When      \ngender or race-based disparities in pay are   \nidentified, the Company adjusts compensation  \nlevels to eliminate those disparities. In the \n2021 review, on average, employees of the     \nCompany in the United States who are women    \nwere paid greater than 99 percent of what     \ntheir male counterparts were paid, and        \nemployees of the Company in the United States \nwho are people of color were paid greater than\n99 percent of what their white counterparts   \nwere paid, taking into account several factors\nincluding comparable jobs and experience.     \n                                              \nThe Company also added two new Company        \nholidays: Juneteenth and My Holiday. The      \nCompany\u2019s recognition of Juneteenth as a      \nholiday reflects the historical importance of \nJuneteenth and alignment with a diverse and   \ninclusive culture. My Holiday is a personal   \nday that every employee can take during the   \ncourse of the year to celebrate a day of      \nsignificance to each employee, such as        \nreligious holidays, day of cultural           \nsignificance, or other personally significant \nday. The Company also increased its parental  \nleave program to 10 weeks to further support  \nits employees and their families.             \n                                              \nEmployee Engagement and Retention As part of  \nits efforts to develop and retain skilled     \nemployees, the Company remains focused on     \nmonitoring employee engagement. The Company\u2019s \nemployee listening program allows the Company \nto collect quantitative and qualitative data  \nfrom employees, which then supports and       \ninforms the Company on human capital          \nstrategies and decisions that impact its      \nemployee base.                                \n                                              \nIn addition to the Company\u2019s talent           \ndevelopment offerings for employees, it       \nlaunched two new efforts in 2021, the Digital \nAcademy and the People Leader Center, which   \nfocus on digital skill development and core   \nleadership skill development, respectively,   \nboth of which the Company believes are        \ncritical in the current and future working    \nenvironment. Enhancing succession and talent  \ndevelopment processes remains a top priority  \nfor the Company.                              \n                      5                       \nThe Company has continued to evolve its       \nflexible work programs to adapt to the current\nenvironment with remote, hybrid and in-person \nwork arrangements, providing additional       \noptionality and flexibility for most          \nemployees. Most of the Company\u2019s non-office   \ncritical staff remained remote during 2021,   \nand the Company continues to assess the extent\nto which employees work remotely or in the    \noffice as conditions evolve. High safety      \nstandards for the Company\u2019s office critical   \nand on-site staff remain important to the     \nCompany, with the Company facilitating        \nenhanced cleaning of work spaces and providing\npersonal protective equipment to employees,   \nsuch as face coverings, gloves and face       \nshields as needed. The Company has also       \ncontinued to provide additional time-off to   \nsupport employees and their families for when \nthey are impacted by COVID-19, need paid time-\noff for vaccinations or require additional    \nchildcare support. The Company will continue  \nto monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and take     \nappropriate measures to protect the safety and\nhealth of its employees.                      \n                                              \n  Competition                                 \n                                              \nThe financial services industry is highly     \ncompetitive. The Company competes with other  \ncommercial banks, savings and loan            \nassociations, mutual savings banks, finance   \ncompanies, mortgage banking companies, credit \nunions, investment companies, credit card     \ncompanies and a variety of other financial    \nservices, advisory and technology companies.  \nThe financial services industry continues to  \nundergo rapid technological change with       \nfrequent introductions of new technology-     \ndriven products and services, including       \ninnovative ways that customers can make       \npayments or manage their accounts, such as    \nthrough the use of mobile payments, digital   \nwallets or digital currencies. In recent      \nyears, competition has increased from         \ninstitutions not subject to the same          \nregulatory restrictions as domestic banks and \nbank holding companies, including by financial\ntechnology companies, or \u201cfintechs,\u201d which may\noffer bank-like products or services that     \ncompete directly with the Company\u2019s products  \nand services. Competition is based on a number\nof factors, including, among others, customer \nservice, quality and range of products and    \nservices offered, price, reputation, interest \nrates on loans and deposits, lending limits   \nand customer convenience, including the       \nability to address customer needs by using    \ntechnology to provide products and services   \nthat customers want to adopt. The Company\u2019s   \nability to continue to compete effectively    \nalso depends in large part on its ability to  \nattract new employees and retain and motivate \nexisting employees, while managing            \ncompensation and other costs. For additional  \ninformation relating to how the Company       \nattracts and retains employees, see \u201cHuman    \nCapital\u201d above.                               \n                                              \n  Information Security                        \n                                              \nInformation security, including cybersecurity,\nis a high priority for the Company. Recent    \nhighly publicized events have highlighted the \nimportance of cybersecurity, including        \ncyberattacks against financial institutions,  \ngovernmental agencies and other organizations \nthat resulted in the compromise of personal   \nand/or confidential information, the theft or \ndestruction of corporate information, and     \ndemands for ransom payments to release        \ncorporate information encrypted by so-called  \n\u201cransomware.\u201d A successful cyberattack,       \nincluding an attack at a third-party vendor   \nthe Company utilizes, could harm the Company\u2019s\nreputation and/or impair its ability to       \nprovide services to its customers. The Company\nhas expended, and may in the future expend,   \nsignificant resources to implement            \ntechnologies and various response and recovery\nplans and procedures as part of its           \ninformation security program.

U.S. Bank National           \nAssociation and its subsidiaries are subject  \nto regulation, examination and supervision    \nprimarily by the Office of the Comptroller of \nthe Currency (the \u201cOCC\u201d) and also by the FDIC,\nthe Federal Reserve, the Consumer Financial   \nProtection Bureau (the \u201cCFPB\u201d), the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and the   \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission (the   \n\u201cCFTC\u201d) in certain areas.                     \n                                              \nSupervision and regulation by the responsible \nregulatory agencies generally include         \ncomprehensive annual reviews of all major     \naspects of the Company\u2019s and U.S. Bank        \nNational Association\u2019s business and condition,\nregular on-site examinations, and imposition  \nof periodic reporting requirements and        \nlimitations on investments and certain types  \nof activities. If the applicable regulatory   \nagencies deem the Company to be operating in a\nmanner that is inconsistent with safe and     \nsound banking practices, the agencies can     \nrequire the entry into informal or formal     \nsupervisory agreements, including board       \nresolutions, memoranda of understanding,      \nwritten agreements and consent or cease and   \ndesist orders, pursuant to which the Company  \nwould be required to take identified          \ncorrective actions to address cited concerns  \nand to refrain from taking certain actions.   \nSupervision and examinations are confidential,\nand the outcomes of these actions generally   \nare not made public.                          \n                                              \nBanking and other financial services statutes,\nregulations and policies are continually under\nreview by the United States Congress, state   \nlegislatures and federal and state regulatory \nagencies. In addition to laws and regulations,\nstate and federal bank regulatory agencies may\nissue policy statements, interpretive letters \nand similar written guidance applicable to the\nCompany and its subsidiaries. Any change in   \nthe statutes, regulations or regulatory       \npolicies applicable to the Company, including \nchanges in their interpretation or            \nimplementation, could have a material effect  \non its business or organization.              \n                                              \nAs a BHC with over $250 billion in total      \nconsolidated assets, the Company is subject to\nthe Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s enhanced prudential      \nstandards, as modified by the federal banking \nregulators\u2019 2019 rules (the \u201cTailoring        \nRules\u201d). The rules applicable to the Company  \nand U.S. Bank National Association are        \ndescribed in more detail below.               \n                                              \nSupervisory Ratings Federal banking regulators\nregularly examine the Company and U.S. Bank   \nNational Association. Following those exams,  \nthe Company (under the Federal Reserve\u2019s Large\nFinancial Institution Rating System) and U.S. \nBank National Association (under the CAMELS   \nrating system) are assigned supervisory       \nratings. Disclosure of these ratings to third \nparties is not allowed without permission of  \nthe issuing regulator. A downgrade in these   \nratings could limit the Company\u2019s ability to  \npursue acquisitions or conduct other          \nexpansionary activities for a period of time, \nrequire new or additional regulatory approvals\nbefore engaging in certain other business     \nactivities or investments, affect U.S. Bank   \nNational Association\u2019s deposit insurance      \nassessment rate, and impose additional        \nrecordkeeping and corporate governance        \nrequirements, as well as generally increase   \nregulatory scrutiny of the Company.           \n                                              \nBHC Activities The Company is a BHC under the \nBHC Act and has elected to be a financial     \nholding company (\u201cFHC\u201d). BHCs that qualify and\nelect to be treated as FHCs may engage in, and\naffiliate with financial companies engaging   \nin, a broader range of activities than would  \notherwise be permitted for a BHC.             \n                                              \nIf an FHC or a depository institution         \ncontrolled by an FHC ceases to be well-       \ncapitalized or well-managed, the Federal      \nReserve may impose corrective capital and     \nmanagerial requirements on the FHC and may    \nplace                                         \n                      7                       \nlimitations on its ability to conduct all of  \nthe business activities that FHCs are         \ngenerally permitted to conduct and its ability\nto make certain acquisitions. See \u201cPermissible\nBusiness Activities\u201d below. If the failure to \nmeet these standards persists, the FHC may be \nrequired to divest its depository institution \nsubsidiaries or cease all activities other    \nthan those activities that may be conducted by\nBHCs that are not FHCs. In addition, if a     \ndepository institution controlled by an FHC   \ndoes not receive a Community Reinvestment Act \n(\u201cCRA\u201d) rating of at least \u201csatisfactory\u201d at  \nits most recent examination, the Federal      \nReserve will prohibit the FHC from conducting \nnew business activities that FHCs are         \ngenerally permitted to conduct and from making\ncertain acquisitions.                         \n                                              \nThe Federal Reserve also requires BHCs to meet\ncertain applicable capital and management     \nstandards. Failure by the Company to meet     \nthese standards could limit the Company from  \nengaging in any new activity or acquiring     \nother companies without the prior approval of \nthe Federal Reserve.                          \n                                              \nPermissible Business Activities As an FHC, the\nCompany may affiliate with securities firms   \nand insurance companies and engage in other   \nactivities that are financial in nature or    \nincidental or complementary to activities that\nare financial in nature. \u201cFinancial in nature\u201d\nactivities include securities underwriting,   \ndealing and market making; sponsoring mutual  \nfunds and investment companies; insurance     \nunderwriting and agency; merchant banking; and\nactivities that the Federal Reserve, in       \nconsultation with the Secretary of the United \nStates Treasury, determines to be financial in\nnature or incidental to such financial        \nactivity. \u201cComplementary activities\u201d are      \nactivities that the Federal Reserve determines\nupon application to be complementary to a     \nfinancial activity and that do not pose a     \nsafety and soundness risk.                    \n                                              \nThe Company generally is not required to      \nobtain Federal Reserve approval to acquire a  \ncompany engaged in activities that are        \nfinancial in nature or incidental to          \nactivities that are financial in nature, as   \nlong as the Company meets the capital,        \nmanagerial and CRA requirements to qualify as \nan FHC. However, the Company is required to   \nreceive approval for an acquisition in which  \nthe total consolidated assets to be acquired  \nexceed $10 billion. FHCs are also required to \nobtain the approval of the Federal Reserve    \nbefore they may acquire more than five percent\nof the voting shares or substantially all of  \nthe assets of an unaffiliated BHC, bank or    \nsavings association. In addition, banks must  \nreceive approval before they may acquire,     \nmerge with, acquire substantially all of the  \nassets of or assume any deposits of a bank or \nsavings association and may be required to    \nreceive approval for acquisitions of other    \ncompanies.                                    \n                                              \nInterstate Banking A BHC may acquire banks in \nstates other than its home state, subject to  \nany state requirement that the bank has been  \norganized and operating for a minimum period  \nof time (not to exceed five years). Also, such\nan acquisition is not permitted if the BHC    \ncontrols, prior to or following the proposed  \nacquisition, more than 10\u00a0percent of the total\namount of deposits of insured depository      \ninstitutions nationwide, or, if the           \nacquisition is the BHC\u2019s initial entry into   \nthe state, more than 30\u00a0percent of the        \ndeposits of insured depository institutions in\nthe state (or any lesser or greater amount set\nby the state). Banks may merge across state   \nlines to create interstate branches and are   \npermitted to establish new branches in another\nstate to the same extent as banks chartered by\nthat state.                                   \n                                              \nRegulatory Approval for Acquisitions In       \ndetermining whether to approve a proposed bank\nacquisition, federal bank regulators will     \nconsider a number of factors, including the   \neffect of the acquisition on competition,     \nfinancial condition and future prospects      \n(including current and projected capital      \nratios and levels); the competence, experience\nand integrity of management and its record of \ncompliance with laws and regulations; the     \nconvenience and needs of the communities to be\nserved (including the acquiring institution\u2019s \nrecord of compliance under the CRA); the      \neffectiveness of the acquiring institution in \ncombating money laundering activities; and the\nextent to which the transaction would result  \nin greater or more concentrated risks to the  \nstability of the United States banking or     \nfinancial system. In addition, approval of    \ninterstate transactions requires that the     \nacquiror satisfy regulatory standards for     \nwell-capitalized and well-managed             \ninstitutions.                                 \n                                              \nIn July 2021, the current United States       \npresidential administration issued an         \nexecutive order on competition, which included\nprovisions relating to bank mergers. These    \nprovisions encourage the Department of Justice\nand                                           \n                      8                       \nthe federal banking regulators to update      \nguidelines on banking mergers and to provide  \nmore scrutiny of bank mergers. A number of    \nlarge bank deals that were pending at the time\nof the executive order have not yet obtained  \napproval, or obtained approval on an extended \ntime frame. The Company is unable to predict  \nwhat impact the executive order will have on  \nthe timing of or ability to obtain regulatory \napprovals of mergers, including its pending   \nmerger with MUFG Union Bank.                  \n                                              \nSource of Strength The Company is required to \nact as a source of strength to U.S. Bank      \nNational Association, and to commit capital   \nand financial resources to support this       \nsubsidiary in circumstances where it might not\notherwise do so. Under these requirements, the\nFederal Reserve may in the future require the \nCompany to provide financial assistance to    \nU.S. Bank National Association, should it     \nexperience financial distress. Capital loans  \nby the Company to U.S. Bank National          \nAssociation would be subordinate in right of  \npayment to deposits and certain other debts of\nU.S. Bank National Association.               \n                                              \nOCC Heightened Standards U.S. Bank National   \nAssociation is subject to the OCC\u2019s guidelines\nestablishing heightened standards for large   \nnational banks, which establish minimum       \nstandards for the design and implementation of\na risk governance framework for banks. The OCC\nmay take action against institutions that fail\nto meet these standards.                      \n                                              \nEnhanced Prudential Standards Under the Dodd- \nFrank Act, as modified by the Economic Growth,\nRegulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act \nand the Tailoring Rules, large bank holding   \ncompanies, such as the Company, are subject to\ncertain enhanced prudential standards based on\nthe banking organization\u2019s size and certain   \n\u201crisk-based indicators.\u201d The prudential       \nstandards include enhanced risk-based capital \nand leverage requirements, enhanced liquidity \nrequirements, enhanced risk management and    \nrisk committee requirements, a requirement to \nsubmit a resolution plan, single-counterparty \ncredit limits and stress tests. Certain of the\nenhanced prudential standards applicable to   \nthe Company are described below in further    \ndetail.                                       \n                                              \nDividend Restrictions The Company is a legal  \nentity separate and distinct from its         \nsubsidiaries. Typically, the majority of the  \nCompany\u2019s operating funds are received in the \nform of dividends paid to the Company by U.S. \nBank National Association. Federal law imposes\nlimitations on the payment of dividends by    \nnational banks. In general, dividends payable \nby U.S. Bank National Association and the     \nCompany\u2019s trust bank subsidiaries, as national\nbanking associations, are limited by rules    \nthat compare dividends to net income for      \nperiods defined by regulation.                \n                                              \nThe OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC also\nhave authority to prohibit or limit the       \npayment of dividends by the banking           \norganizations they supervise (including the   \nCompany and U.S. Bank National Association),  \nif, in the banking regulator\u2019s opinion,       \npayment of a dividend would constitute an     \nunsafe or unsound practice in light of the    \nfinancial condition of the banking            \norganization.                                 \n                                              \nIn addition, the Federal Reserve\u2019s final rule \nimplementing the stress capital buffer (\u201cSCB\u201d)\nprovides that a BHC must receive prior        \napproval for any dividend, stock repurchase or\nother capital distribution, other than a      \ncapital distribution on a newly issued capital\ninstrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit\nits capital plan. The rule also provides that \na BHC must resubmit its capital plan if, among\nother things, the BHC determines there has    \nbeen or will be a material change in the BHC\u2019s\nrisk profile, financial condition, or         \ncorporate structure since the BHC last        \nsubmitted its capital plan.                   \n                                              \nCapital Requirements The Company is subject to\ncertain regulatory risk-based capital and     \nleverage requirements under capital rules     \nadopted by the Federal Reserve, and U.S. Bank \nNational Association is subject to            \nsubstantially similar rules adopted by the    \nOCC. These rules implement the Basel          \nCommittee\u2019s framework for strengthening the   \nregulation, supervision and risk management of\nbanks (\u201cBasel III\u201d), as well as certain       \nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. These       \nquantitative calculations are minimums, and   \nthe Federal Reserve and OCC may determine that\na banking organization, based on its size,    \ncomplexity or risk profile, must maintain a   \nhigher level of capital in order to operate in\na safe and sound manner.                      \n                      9                       \nUnder the Tailoring Rules, the Company and    \nU.S. Bank National Association are each       \nsubject to \u201cCategory III\u201d standards, and are  \n\u201cstandardized approach\u201d banking organizations \nthat are subject to rules that provide for    \nsimplified capital requirements relating to   \nthe threshold deductions for mortgage         \nservicing assets, deferred tax assets arising \nfrom temporary differences that a banking     \norganization could not realize through net    \noperating loss carry backs, and investments in\nthe capital of unconsolidated financial       \ninstitutions, as well as the inclusion of     \nminority interests in regulatory capital.     \nSubstantial growth in total consolidated      \nassets (including assets obtained in          \nacquisitions) or cross-jurisdictional activity\n(as defined in the Tailoring Rules) could     \naffect the Company\u2019s continued classification \nas a \u201cCategory III\u201d institution, which could  \nresult in more stringent capital, liquidity,  \nand other regulatory requirements.            \n                                              \nUnder the United States Basel III-based       \ncapital rules, the Company is subject to a    \nminimum common equity tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) capital \nratio (CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets)  \nof 4.5\u00a0percent, a minimum tier 1 capital ratio\nof 6.0\u00a0percent and a minimum total capital    \nratio of 8.0\u00a0percent. The Company is also     \nsubject to the SCB, which is based on the     \nresults of the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory  \nstress tests and the Company\u2019s planned common \nstock dividends, and, if deployed by the      \nFederal Reserve, up to a 2.5\u00a0percent common   \nequity tier 1 countercyclical capital buffer. \nThese additional requirements must be         \nsatisfied entirely with capital that qualifies\nas CET1. Although the Federal Reserve has not \nto date raised the countercyclical capital    \nbuffer above zero percent, the countercyclical\ncapital buffer could change in the future. The\nSCB generally is assigned on an annual basis  \nand becomes effective on October\u00a01 of each    \nyear, subject to a 2.5\u00a0percent floor, and may \nvary over time. As of December\u00a031, 2021, the  \nSCB applicable to the Company is 2.5\u00a0percent. \nIf the Federal Reserve were to raise the      \ncountercyclical capital buffer, or if the SCB \napplicable to the Company were to exceed      \n2.5\u00a0percent, this would also change the       \neffective minimum capital ratios to which the \nCompany is subject.                           \n                                              \nBanking organizations that fail to meet the   \neffective minimum ratios will be subject to   \nconstraints on capital distributions,         \nincluding dividends and share repurchases, and\ncertain discretionary executive compensation, \nwith the severity of the constraints depending\non the extent of the shortfall and \u201celigible  \nretained income\u201d (defined as the greater of   \n(i) net income for the four preceding         \nquarters, net of distributions and associated \ntax effects not reflected in net income; and  \n(ii) the average of all net income over the   \npreceding four quarters).                     \n                                              \nUnited States banking organizations are also  \nsubject to a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of \n4.0\u00a0percent. As a Category III banking        \norganization, the Company is also subject to a\nminimum Supplementary Leverage Ratio (\u201cSLR\u201d)  \nof 3.0\u00a0percent that takes into account both   \non-balance sheet and certain off-balance sheet\nexposures. At December\u00a031, 2021, the Company  \nexceeded the applicable minimum tier 1        \nleverage ratio and SLR requirements.          \n                                              \nIn December 2017, the Basel Committee         \nfinalized a package of revisions to the Basel \nIII framework. The changes are meant to       \nimprove the calculation of risk-weighted      \nassets (including by recalibrating risk       \nweights and introducing new capital           \nrequirements for certain \u201cunconditionally     \ncancellable commitments,\u201d including unused    \nlines of credit) and improve the comparability\nof capital ratios by (i)\u00a0enhancing the        \nrobustness and risk sensitivity of the        \nstandardized approaches for credit risk,      \ncredit valuation adjustment (\u201cCVA\u201d) risk and  \noperational risk; (ii)\u00a0constraining the use of\nthe internal model approaches, by placing     \nlimits on certain inputs used to calculate    \ncapital requirements under the internal       \nratings-based (\u201cIRB\u201d) approach for credit risk\nand by removing the use of the internal model \napproaches for CVA risk and for operational   \nrisk; (iii)\u00a0introducing a leverage ratio      \nbuffer to further limit the leverage of global\nsystemically important banks (\u201cG-SIBs\u201d); and  \n(iv)\u00a0replacing the existing Basel II output   \nfloor with a more robust risk-sensitive floor \nbased on the Committee\u2019s revised Basel III    \nstandardized approaches. Under the Basel      \nstandards, the implementation date for the    \nrevised standardized approach for credit risk \nand leverage ratios as well as the IRB, CVA,  \noperational risk, and market risk frameworks  \nis January\u00a01, 2023. In addition, in January   \n2019, the Basel Committee published a revised \nmarket risk framework that, among other       \nthings, revises the standardized approach for \nmarket risk. The output floor will be subject \nto a transitional period beginning in         \nJanuary\u00a01, 2023, with full implementation by  \nJanuary\u00a01, 2028. The effects of these         \nrevisions on the Company and U.S. Bank        \nNational Association will depend on the manner\nin which they are implemented by the United   \nStates federal banking agencies. At this time,\na United States based rule has not been       \nreleased.                                     \n                      10                      \nIn 2020, the United States federal banking    \nagencies adopted a rule that allowed banking  \norganizations, including the Company and U.S. \nBank National Association, to elect to delay  \ntemporarily the estimated effects of adopting \nthe current expected credit loss accounting   \nstandard (\u201cCECL\u201d) on regulatory capital until \nJanuary 2022 and subsequently to phase in the \neffects through January 2025. Through the 2021\nstress test cycle, the Federal Reserve has not\nyet incorporated CECL into the calculation of \nthe allowance for credit losses in supervisory\nstress tests. For further discussion of CECL, \nsee Notes 1 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in the 2021 Annual       \nReport. The Company and U.S. Bank National    \nAssociation elected to delay and subsequently \nphase in the regulatory capital impact of CECL\nin accordance with this rule.                 \n                                              \nFor additional information regarding the      \nCompany\u2019s regulatory capital, see \u201cCapital    \nManagement\u201d in the 2021 Annual Report.        \n                                              \nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review As  \nrequired by the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR rules, \nthe Company submits a capital plan to the     \nFederal Reserve on an annual basis. As part of\nthe CCAR process, the Federal Reserve         \nevaluates the Company\u2019s plans to make capital \ndistributions, including by repurchasing stock\nor making dividend payments, under a number of\nmacroeconomic and Company-specific assumptions\nbased on the Company\u2019s and the Federal        \nReserve\u2019s stress tests described under \u201cStress\nTesting\u201d below. These capital plans consist of\na number of mandatory elements, including an  \nassessment of a company\u2019s sources and uses of \ncapital over a nine-quarter planning horizon  \nassuming both expected and stressful          \nconditions; a detailed description of a       \ncompany\u2019s process for assessing capital       \nadequacy; and a demonstration of a company\u2019s  \nability to maintain capital above each minimum\nregulatory capital ratio (without taking the  \nbuffers into account) under expected and      \nstressful conditions.                         \n                                              \nStress Testing The Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR     \nframework and the Dodd-Frank Act stress       \ntesting framework require BHCs subject to     \nCategory III standards such as the Company to \nconduct an annual internal stress test in     \nconnection with its annual capital plan       \nsubmission as well as biennial company-run    \nstress tests, and subject such bank holding   \ncompanies to annual supervisory stress tests  \nconducted by the Federal Reserve. Among other \nthings, the company-run stress tests employ   \nstress scenarios developed by the Company as  \nwell as stress scenarios provided by the      \nFederal Reserve and incorporate the Dodd-Frank\nAct capital actions (as opposed to the        \nCompany\u2019s planned capital actions), which are \nintended to normalize capital distributions   \nacross large United\u00a0States bank holding       \ncompanies. The Federal Reserve conducts CCAR  \nand Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests   \nemploying stress scenarios and internal       \nsupervisory models, and incorporates the      \nCompany\u2019s planned capital actions and the     \nDodd-Frank Act capital actions, respectively, \ninto its stress tests. The Federal Reserve and\nthe Company are currently required to publish \nthe results of the annual supervisory and     \nbiennial company-run stress tests,            \nrespectively, no later than June\u00a030 of each   \napplicable year.                              \n                                              \nUnder the OCC\u2019s rules, national banks with    \nassets in excess of $250\u00a0billion, including   \nU.S. Bank National Association, are required  \nto submit company-run stress test results to  \nthe OCC concurrently with their parent BHC\u2019s  \nCCAR submission to the Federal Reserve. The   \nstress test is based on the OCC\u2019s stress      \nscenarios (which are typically the same as the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s stress scenarios) and       \ncapital actions that are appropriate for the  \neconomic conditions assumed in each scenario. \n                                              \nBasel III Liquidity Requirements As a Category\nIII banking organization, the Company is      \nsubject to a minimum Liquidity Coverage Ratio \n(\u201cLCR\u201d). The LCR is designed to ensure that   \nbank holding companies have sufficient high-  \nquality liquid assets to survive a significant\nliquidity stress event lasting for 30 calendar\ndays. In addition, the Company and U.S. Bank  \nNational Association are subject to the Net   \nStable Funding Ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) rule, which     \nbecame effective in July 2021 and is designed \nto promote stable, longer-term funding of     \nassets and business activities over a one-year\ntime horizon. Under the Tailoring Rules and   \nNSFR rule, the Company and U.S. Bank National \nAssociation, as Category III banking          \norganizations with less than $75\u00a0billion of   \nweighted short-term wholesale funding, qualify\nfor reduced LCR and NSFR requirements         \ncalibrated at 85\u00a0percent of the full          \nrequirements.                                 \n                      11                      \nPrompt Corrective Action The Federal Deposit  \nInsurance Corporation Improvement Act         \n(\u201cFDICIA\u201d) provides a framework for regulation\nof depository institutions and their          \naffiliates (including parent holding          \ncompanies) by federal banking regulators. As  \npart of that framework, the FDICIA requires   \nthe relevant federal banking regulator to take\n\u201cprompt corrective action\u201d with respect to an \nFDIC-insured depository institution, such as  \nU.S. Bank National Association, if that       \ninstitution does not meet certain capital     \nadequacy standards. Supervisory actions by the\nappropriate federal banking regulator under   \nthe \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d rules generally\ndepend upon an institution\u2019s classification   \nwithin five capital categories. An institution\nthat fails to remain well-capitalized becomes \nsubject to a series of restrictions that      \nincrease in severity as its capital condition \nweakens. Such restrictions may include a      \nprohibition on capital distributions,         \nrestrictions on asset growth or restrictions  \non the ability to receive regulatory approval \nof applications. The FDICIA also provides for \nenhanced supervisory authority over           \nundercapitalized institutions, including      \nauthority for the appointment of a conservator\nor receiver for the institution.              \n                                              \nThe regulations apply only to banks and not to\nBHCs such as the Company. However, the Federal\nReserve is authorized to take appropriate     \naction at the BHC level, based on the         \nundercapitalized status of the BHC\u2019s          \nsubsidiary banking institutions. In certain   \ninstances, relating to an undercapitalized    \nbank, the BHC would be required to guarantee  \nthe performance of the undercapitalized       \nsubsidiary\u2019s capital restoration plan and     \ncould be liable for civil money damages for   \nfailure to fulfill those guarantee            \ncommitments.                                  \n                                              \nDeposit Insurance The DIF provides insurance  \ncoverage for certain deposits, up to a        \nstandard maximum deposit insurance amount of  \n$250,000 per depositor. Deposits at U.S.      \nNational Bank are insured up to the applicable\nlimits. The DIF is funded through assessments \non insured depository institutions, including \nU.S. Bank National Association, based on the  \nrisk each institution poses to the DIF. The   \nFDIC may increase U.S. Bank National          \nAssociation\u2019s insurance premiums based on     \nvarious factors, including the FDIC\u2019s         \nassessment of its risk profile.               \n                                              \nIn addition, large insured depository         \ninstitutions, including U.S. Bank National    \nAssociation, are subject to enhanced deposit  \naccount recordkeeping and related information \ntechnology system requirements meant to       \nfacilitate prompt payment of insured deposits \nif such an institution were to fail.          \n                                              \nDepositor Preference Under federal law, in the\nevent of the liquidation or other resolution  \nof an insured depository institution, the     \nclaims of a receiver of the institution for   \nadministrative expense and the claims of      \nholders of domestic deposit liabilities have  \npriority over the claims of other unsecured   \ncreditors of the institution, including       \nholders of publicly issued senior or          \nsubordinated debt and depositors in non-      \ndomestic offices. As a result, those          \ndebtholders and depositors would be treated   \ndifferently from, and could receive, if       \nanything, substantially less than, the        \ndepositors in domestic offices of the         \ndepository institution.                       \n                                              \nOrderly Liquidation Authority Upon the        \ninsolvency of a BHC, such as the Company, the \nFDIC may be appointed as conservator or       \nreceiver of the BHC if the Secretary of the   \nTreasury determines (upon the written         \nrecommendation of the FDIC and the Federal    \nReserve and after consultation with the       \nPresident of the United\u00a0States) that certain  \nconditions set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act    \nregarding the potential impact on financial   \nstability of a financial company\u2019s failure    \nhave been met. FDIC rules set forth a         \ncomprehensive method for the receivership of a\ncovered financial company. Acting as a        \nconservator or receiver, the FDIC would have  \nbroad powers to transfer any assets or        \nliabilities of a BHC without the approval of  \nits creditors.                                \n                                              \nResolution Plans The Company is required by   \nthe Federal Reserve and the FDIC to submit a  \nperiodic plan for the rapid and orderly       \nresolution of the Company and its significant \nlegal entities in the event of future material\nfinancial distress or failure. If the Federal \nReserve and the FDIC jointly determine that   \nthe resolution plan is not credible and such  \ndeficiencies are not cured in a timely manner,\nthe regulators may jointly impose on the      \nCompany more stringent capital, leverage or   \nliquidity requirements or restrictions on the \nCompany\u2019s growth, activities or operations. If\nthe Company were to fail to address the       \ndeficiencies in its resolution plan when      \nrequired, it could eventually be required to  \ndivest certain assets or operations. As a     \nCategory III banking organization, the Company\nis required to submit resolution plans on a   \ntriennial cycle (alternating between          \n                      12                      \ntargeted and full submissions). In December,  \n2020, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC        \nreleased targeted plan guidance and directed  \nlarge foreign and domestic banks to file      \nresolution plans including core elements of a \nfirm\u2019s resolution strategy as well as how each\nfirm has integrated changes to and lessons    \nlearned from its response to COVID-19 into its\nresolution planning process. The Company      \nsubmitted its targeted resolution plan in     \nDecember, 2021.                               \n                                              \nIn addition, U.S. Bank National Association is\nrequired to file periodically a separate      \nresolution plan with the FDIC that should     \nenable the FDIC, as receiver, to resolve the  \ninstitution under applicable receivership     \nprovisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance   \nAct in a manner that ensures that depositors  \nreceive access to their insured deposits      \nwithin one business day of the institution\u2019s  \nfailure, maximizes the net present value      \nreturn from the sale or disposition of its    \nassets and minimizes the amount of any loss to\nthe institution\u2019s creditors. In June 2021, the\nFDIC issued a Statement on Resolution Plans   \nfor Insured Depository Institutions (the \u201cFDIC\nStatement\u201d). Among other things, the FDIC     \nStatement establishes a three-year filing     \ncycle for banks with $100\u00a0billion or more in  \ntotal assets and provides details regarding   \nthe content that filers will be expected to   \nprepare. The FDIC Statement also divides      \ncovered insured depository institutions       \n(\u201cIDIs\u201d) into two groups for purposes of the  \ntiming of resolution plan submissions, with   \nthe first group consisting of IDIs for which  \nthe parent is not a United States G-SIB or    \n\u201cCategory II\u201d firm. Under this guidance, U.S. \nBank National Association is in the first     \ngroup.                                        \n                                              \nRecovery Plans The OCC has established        \nenforceable guidelines for recovery planning  \nby insured national banks with average total  \nconsolidated assets of $250\u00a0billion or more,  \nincluding U.S. Bank National Association. The \nguidelines provide that a covered bank should \ndevelop and maintain a recovery plan that is  \nappropriate for its individual risk profile,  \nsize, activities, and complexity, including   \nthe complexity of its organizational and legal\nentity structure. The guidelines state that a \nrecovery plan should, among other elements,   \n(i)\u00a0establish triggers, which are quantitative\nor qualitative indicators of the risk or      \nexistence of severe stress that should always \nbe escalated to management or the board of    \ndirectors, as appropriate, for purposes of    \ninitiating a response; (ii)\u00a0identify a wide   \nrange of credible options that a covered bank \ncould undertake to restore financial and      \noperational strength and viability; and (iii) \naddress escalation procedures, management     \nreports, and communication procedures. The    \nboard of U.S. Bank National Association       \nreviewed and approved U.S. Bank National      \nAssociation\u2019s recovery plan pursuant to these \nguidelines in December 2021.                  \n                                              \nTransactions with Affiliates There are various\nlegal restrictions on the extent to which the \nCompany and its non-bank subsidiaries may     \nborrow or otherwise engage in certain types of\ntransactions with U.S. Bank National          \nAssociation or its subsidiaries. Under the    \nFederal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve\u2019s \nRegulation W, U.S. Bank National Association  \nand its subsidiaries are subject to           \nquantitative and qualitative limits on        \nextensions of credit (including credit        \nexposure arising from repurchase and reverse  \nrepurchase agreements, securities borrowing   \nand derivative transactions), purchases of    \nassets, and certain other transactions with   \nthe Company or its other non-bank subsidiaries\nand affiliates. Additionally, transactions    \nbetween U.S. Bank National Association or its \nsubsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Company\nor its other non-bank subsidiaries and        \naffiliates, on the other hand, are required to\nbe on arm\u2019s length terms. Transactions between\nU.S. Bank National Associations and its       \naffiliates must be consistent with standards  \nof safety and soundness.                      \n                                              \nAnti-Money Laundering and Sanctions The       \nCompany is subject to several federal laws    \nthat are designed to combat money laundering  \nand terrorist financing, and to restrict      \ntransactions with persons, companies, or      \nforeign governments sanctioned by United      \nStates authorities. This category of laws     \nincludes the Bank Secrecy Act (the \u201cBSA\u201d), the\nMoney Laundering Control Act, the USA PATRIOT \nAct (collectively, \u201cAML laws\u201d), and           \nimplementing regulations for the International\nEmergency Economic Powers Act and the Trading \nwith the Enemy Act, as administered by the    \nUnited States Treasury Department\u2019s Office of \nForeign Assets Control (\u201csanctions laws\u201d).    \n                                              \nAs implemented by federal banking and         \nsecurities regulators and the Department of   \nthe Treasury, AML laws obligate depository    \ninstitutions and broker-dealers to verify     \ntheir customers\u2019 identity, verify the identity\nof beneficial owners of legal entity          \ncustomers, conduct customer due diligence,    \nreport on suspicious activity, file           \n                      13                      \nreports of transactions in currency, and      \nconduct enhanced due diligence on certain     \naccounts. Sanctions laws prohibit United      \nStates persons and certain foreign affiliates \nfrom engaging in any transaction with a       \nrestricted person or restricted country.      \nDepository institutions and broker-dealers are\nrequired by their respective federal          \nregulators to maintain policies and procedures\nin order to ensure compliance with the above  \nobligations. Federal regulators regularly     \nexamine BSA/Anti-Money Laundering (\u201cAML\u201d) and \nsanctions compliance programs to ensure their \nadequacy and effectiveness, and the frequency \nand extent of such examinations and related   \nremedial actions have been increasing.        \n                                              \nIn January 2021, the Anti-Money Laundering Act\nof 2020 (\u201cAMLA\u201d), which amends the BSA, was   \nenacted. Among other things, the AMLA codifies\na risk-based approach to anti-money laundering\ncompliance for financial institutions;        \nrequires the development of standards by the  \nU.S. Department of the Treasury for evaluating\ntechnology and internal processes for BSA     \ncompliance; and expands enforcement- and      \ninvestigation-related authority, including a  \nsignificant expansion in the available        \nsanctions for certain BSA violations. Many of \nthe statutory provisions in the AMLA will     \nrequire additional rulemakings, reports and   \nother measures, and the impact of the AMLA    \nwill depend on, among other things, rulemaking\nand implementation guidance.                  \n                                              \nCommunity Reinvestment Act U.S. Bank National \nAssociation is subject to the provisions of   \nthe CRA. Under the terms of the CRA, banks    \nhave a continuing and affirmative obligation, \nconsistent with safe and sound operation, to  \nhelp meet the credit needs of their           \ncommunities, including providing credit to    \nindividuals residing in low- and moderate-    \nincome neighborhoods. The OCC assesses U.S.   \nBank National Association on its record in    \nmeeting the credit needs of the community     \nserved by that institution, including low- and\nmoderate-income neighborhoods. CRA assessments\nalso are considered by the Federal Reserve or \nOCC when reviewing applications by banking    \ninstitutions to acquire, merge or consolidate \nwith another banking institution or its       \nholding company, to establish a new branch    \noffice that will accept deposits, or to       \nrelocate an office. In the case of a BHC      \napplying for approval to acquire a bank or    \nother BHC, the Federal Reserve will assess the\nCRA records of each subsidiary depository     \ninstitution of the applicant BHC, and those   \nrecords may be the basis for denying the      \napplication. U.S. Bank National Association   \nreceived an \u201cOutstanding\u201d CRA rating in its   \nmost recent examination, covering the period  \nfrom January\u00a01, 2012 through December\u00a031,     \n2015.                                         \n                                              \nIn December 2021, the OCC issued a final rule \n(the \u201c2021 CRA Rule\u201d) to rescind the OCC\u2019s May\n2020 CRA rule (the \u201c2020 CRA Rule\u201d), which    \ncreated a new CRA framework, and replace it   \nwith rules based on the 1995 CRA rules, as    \nrevised, that were issued jointly by the OCC, \nFederal Reserve and FDIC. Because many aspects\nof the 2020 CRA Rule had not yet been         \nimplemented and because of certain transition \nprovisions in the 2021 CRA Rule, the Company  \ndoes not expect the 2021 CRA Rule to have a   \nsignificant effect on U.S. Bank National      \nAssociation.                                  \n                                              \nRegulation of Brokerage, Investment Advisory  \nand Insurance Activities The Company conducts \na broad range of securities activities, both  \nretail and institutional, in the United States\nthrough U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. and PFM\nFund Distributors, Inc. (\u201cbroker-dealer       \nentities\u201d). These activities are subject to   \nregulations of the SEC, the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority and other authorities,   \nincluding state regulators. These regulations \ngenerally cover licensing of securities       \npersonnel, interactions with customers and    \ncounterparties, trading operations, customer  \nsuitability and communications. Securities    \nregulators impose capital requirements on the \nCompany\u2019s broker-dealer entities and          \nperiodically review their sales practice and  \nfinancial operations. In addition, the        \nCompany\u2019s broker-dealer entities are members  \nof the Securities Investor Protection         \nCorporation, which oversees the liquidation of\nmember broker-dealers that close when the     \nbroker-dealer is bankrupt or in financial     \ntrouble and imposes membership fee assessments\nand other reporting requirements on the       \nbroker-dealer entities.                       \n                                              \nThe operations of the First American family of\nfunds, the Company\u2019s proprietary money market \nfund complex, also are subject to regulation  \nby the SEC, including rules requiring a       \nfloating net asset value for institutional    \nprime and tax-free money market funds and     \npermitting the board of directors of the money\nmarket funds the ability to limit redemptions \nduring periods of stress (allowing for the use\nof liquidity fees and redemption gates during \nsuch times).                                  \n                      14                      \nThe Company\u2019s operations in the areas of      \ninsurance brokerage and reinsurance of credit \nlife insurance are subject to regulation and  \nsupervision by various state insurance        \nregulatory authorities, including the         \nlicensing of insurance brokers and agents.    \n                                              \nRegulation of Derivatives and the Swaps       \nMarketplace Under the Dodd-Frank Act, U.S.    \nBank National Association, as a CFTC          \nprovisionally-registered swap dealer, is      \nsubject to rules regarding the regulation of  \nthe swaps marketplace and over-the-counter    \nderivatives, including rules that require swap\ndealers and major swap participants to        \nregister with the CFTC, to meet robust        \nbusiness conduct standards to lower risk and  \npromote market integrity, to meet certain     \nrecordkeeping and reporting requirements so   \nthat regulators can better monitor the        \nmarkets, to centrally clear and trade swaps on\nregulated exchanges or execution facilities,  \nand to be subject to certain capital and      \nmargin requirements.                          \n                                              \nIn addition, the OCC\u2019s rules concerning swap  \nmargin and capital requirements for swap      \ndealers regulated by the OCC were fully       \nphased-in on September\u00a01, 2021. These rules   \nmandate the exchange of initial and variation \nmargin for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared  \nsecurity-based swaps between swap entities    \nregulated by the five agencies and certain    \ncounterparties. The amount of margin will vary\nbased on the relative risk of the non-cleared \nswap or non-cleared security-based swap. Other\nrules, finalized by the banking regulators in \nJune 2020, generally exempt inter-affiliate   \ntransactions from initial margin requirements \nto the extent a depository institution\u2019s total\nexposure to all affiliates is less than       \n15\u00a0percent of its tier 1 capital.             \n                                              \nThe Volcker Rule Section\u00a013 of the BHC Act and\nits implementing regulations, commonly        \nreferred to as the \u201cVolcker Rule,\u201d prohibit   \nbanking entities from engaging in proprietary \ntrading, and prohibit certain interests in, or\nrelationships with, hedge funds or private    \nequity funds. The Volcker Rule applies to the \nCompany, U.S. Bank National Association and   \ntheir affiliates, and compliance requirements \nare tailored based on the size and scope of   \ntrading activities. The Company has a Volcker \nRule compliance program in place that covers  \nall of its subsidiaries and affiliates,       \nincluding U.S. Bank National Association.     \n                                              \nData Privacy and Cybersecurity Federal and    \nstate law contains extensive consumer privacy \nand data protection provisions. The Gramm     \nLeach-Bliley Act (\u201cGLBA\u201d) requires financial  \ninstitutions to periodically disclose their   \nprivacy policies and practices relating to    \nsharing nonpublic personal information and    \nenables retail customers to opt out of the    \nsharing of information with unaffiliated third\nparties under certain circumstances. Other    \nfederal and state laws and regulations impact \nthe Company\u2019s ability to share certain        \ninformation with affiliates and non-affiliates\nfor marketing and/or non-marketing purposes,  \nor to contact customers with marketing offers.\nThe GLBA also requires financial institutions \nto implement a comprehensive information      \nsecurity program. Security and privacy        \npolicies and procedures for the protection of \npersonal and confidential information are in  \neffect across all the Company\u2019s businesses and\ngeographic locations.                         \n                                              \nData privacy and data protection are areas of \nincreasing state legislative focus, and       \nseveral states have recently enacted consumer \nprivacy laws that impose compliance           \nobligations with respect to personal          \ninformation. For example, the Company is      \nsubject to the California Consumer Protection \nAct of 2018 and its implementing regulations  \n(collectively, the \u201cCCPA\u201d). The CCPA gives    \nconsumers the right to request disclosure of  \ninformation collected about them, and whether \nthat information has been sold or shared with \nothers, the right to request deletion of      \npersonal information (subject to certain      \nexceptions), the right to opt out of the sale \nof the consumer\u2019s personal information, and   \nthe right not to be discriminated against for \nexercising these rights. The CCPA contains    \nseveral exemptions, including an exemption    \napplicable to information that is collected,  \nprocessed, sold or disclosed pursuant to the  \nGLBA. The CCPA also provides residents of     \nCalifornia (regardless of whether their       \ninformation is covered under the GLBA         \nexemption) with a limited private right of    \naction against the unauthorized access and    \nexfiltration, theft, or disclosure of certain \ntypes of personal information, including the  \nright to seek statutory damages. In November  \n2020, voters in the State of California       \napproved the California Privacy Rights Act    \n(\u201cCPRA\u201d), a ballot measure that amends and    \nsupplements the CCPA by, among other things,  \nexpanding certain rights relating to personal \ninformation and its use, collection, and      \ndisclosure by covered businesses and expanding\ncoverage to include employees, job applicants \nand business contacts who are residents       \n                      15                      \nof California. The key provisions of the CPRA \nwill become effective on January\u00a01, 2023. In  \naddition, similar laws have been and may be   \nadopted by other states where the Company does\nbusiness, including the Colorado Privacy Act  \nand the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act,\neach of which were enacted in 2021. The       \nCompany has made and will make operational    \nadjustments in accordance with the            \nrequirements of the CCPA and other state      \nprivacy laws. The federal government may also \npass additional data privacy or data          \nprotection legislation. In addition, in the   \nEuropean Union (\u201cEU\u201d), privacy law is governed\nby the General Data Protection Regulation     \n(\u201cGDPR\u201d), which is directly binding and       \napplicable for each EU member state. The GDPR \ncontains enhanced compliance obligations and  \nincreased penalties for non-compliance        \ncompared to the prior law governing data      \nprivacy in the EU.                            \n                                              \nLike other lenders, U.S. Bank National        \nAssociation and other subsidiaries of the     \nCompany use credit bureau data in their       \nunderwriting activities. Use of such data is  \nregulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act \n(\u201cFCRA\u201d), and the FCRA also regulates         \nreporting information to credit bureaus,      \nprescreening individuals for credit offers,   \nsharing of credit data between affiliates, and\nusing affiliate credit data for marketing     \npurposes. Similar state laws may impose       \nadditional requirements on the Company and its\nsubsidiaries.                                 \n                                              \nThe federal banking regulators, as well as the\nSEC, CFTC, and related self-regulatory        \norganizations, regularly issue guidance on    \ncybersecurity that is intended to enhance     \ncyber risk management among financial         \ninstitutions. A financial institution\u2019s       \nmanagement is expected to maintain sufficient \nbusiness continuity planning processes to     \nensure the rapid recovery, resumption and     \nmaintenance of the institution\u2019s operations   \nafter a cyber-attack. A financial institution \nis also expected to develop appropriate       \nprocesses to enable recovery of data and      \nbusiness operations if the institution or its \ncritical service providers fall victim to a   \ncyber-attack.                                 \n                                              \nIn November 2021, the United States federal   \nbank regulatory agencies adopted a rule       \nregarding notification requirements for       \nbanking organizations related to significant  \ncomputer security incidents. Under the final  \nrule, a BHC, such as the Company, and a       \nnational bank, such as U.S. Bank National     \nAssociation, are required to notify the       \nFederal Reserve or OCC, respectively, within  \n36 hours of incidents that have materially    \ndisrupted or degraded, or are reasonably      \nlikely to materially disrupt or degrade, the  \nbanking organization\u2019s ability to deliver     \nservices to a material portion of its customer\nbase, jeopardize the viability of key         \noperations of the banking organization, or    \nimpact the stability of the financial sector. \n                                              \nConsumer Protection U.S. Bank National        \nAssociation\u2019s retail banking activities are   \nsubject to a variety of federal and state     \nstatutes and regulations designed to protect  \nconsumers. These laws and regulations require,\namong other things, disclosures of the cost of\ncredit and terms of deposit accounts, provide \nsubstantive consumer rights, prohibit         \ndiscrimination in credit transactions,        \nregulate the use of credit report information,\nprovide financial privacy protections,        \nprohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive        \npractices and subject U.S. Bank National      \nAssociation to substantial regulatory         \noversight. Violations of applicable consumer  \nprotection laws can result in significant     \npotential liability from litigation brought by\ncustomers, including actual damages,          \nrestitution and attorneys\u2019 fees, and may also \nresult in significant reputational harm. U.S. \nBank National Association\u2019s regulators may    \nalso seek to enforce consumer protection      \nrequirements and obtain these and other       \nremedies, including regulatory sanctions and  \ncivil money penalties.                        \n                                              \nU.S. Bank National Association and its        \nsubsidiaries are subject to supervision and   \nregulation by the CFPB with respect to federal\nconsumer laws. The CFPB has undertaken        \nnumerous rule-making and other initiatives,   \nincluding issuing informal guidance and taking\nenforcement actions against certain financial \ninstitutions. The CFPB\u2019s rulemaking,          \nexamination and enforcement authority has     \naffected and will continue to impact financial\ninstitutions that provide consumer financial  \nproducts and services, including the Company, \nU.S. Bank National Association, and the       \nCompany\u2019s other subsidiaries. These regulatory\nactivities may limit the types of financial   \nservices and products the Company may offer,  \nwhich in turn may reduce the Company\u2019s        \nrevenues.                                     \n                                              \nOther Supervision and Regulation The Company  \nis subject to the disclosure and regulatory   \nrequirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, and the Securities Exchange Act of   \n1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange               \n                      16                      \nAct\u201d), both as administered by the SEC, by    \nvirtue of the Company\u2019s status as a public    \ncompany.

These       \nrestrictions limited the aggregate amount of  \ncommon stock dividends and share repurchases  \nto an amount that did not exceed the average  \nnet income of the four preceding calendar     \nquarters. Based on the results of the December\n2020 Federal Reserve Stress Test, the Company \nannounced on December 22, 2020 that its Board \nof Directors had approved an authorization to \nrepurchase $3.0 billion of its common stock   \nbeginning January 1, 2021, and repurchased    \n$1.5 billion of its common stock during the   \nfirst six months of 2021 under this program.  \nThe Company suspended all common stock        \nrepurchases at the beginning of the third     \nquarter of 2021, except for those done        \nexclusively in connection with its stock-based\ncompensation programs, due to its recently    \nannounced pending acquisition of MUFG Union   \nBank\u2019s core regional banking franchise.
