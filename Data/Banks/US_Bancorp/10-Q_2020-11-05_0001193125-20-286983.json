Continued deterioration in general \nbusiness and economic conditions or turbulence\nin domestic or global financial markets could \nadversely affect U.S. Bancorp\u2019s revenues and  \nthe values of its assets and liabilities,     \nreduce the availability of funding to certain \nfinancial institutions, lead to a tightening  \nof credit, and increase stock price           \nvolatility. In addition, changes to statutes, \nregulations, or regulatory policies or        \npractices could affect U.S. Bancorp in        \nsubstantial and unpredictable ways. U.S.      \nBancorp\u2019s results could also be adversely     \naffected by changes in interest rates; further\nincreases in unemployment rates; deterioration\nin the credit quality of its loan portfolios  \nor in the value of the collateral securing    \nthose loans; deterioration in the value of its\ninvestment securities; legal and regulatory   \ndevelopments; litigation; increased           \ncompetition from both banks and non-          \nbanks;changes in the level of tariffs and     \nother trade policies of the United States and \nits global trading partners; civil unrest;    \nchanges in customer behavior and preferences; \nbreaches in data security; failures to        \nsafeguard personal information; effects of    \nmergers and acquisitions and related          \nintegration; effects of critical accounting   \npolicies and judgments; and management\u2019s      \nability to effectively manage credit risk,    \nmarket risk, operational risk, compliance     \nrisk, strategic risk, interest rate risk,     \nliquidity risk and reputation risk.

U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                     \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis OVERVIEW \nEarnings SummaryU.S. Bancorp and its          \nsubsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) reported net     \nincome attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $1.6   \nbillion for the third quarter of 2020, or     \n$0.99 per diluted common share, compared with \n$1.9 billion, or $1.15 per diluted common     \nshare, for the third quarter of 2019. Return  \non average assets and return on average common\nequity were 1.17 percent and 12.8 percent,    \nrespectively, for the third quarter of 2020,  \ncompared with 1.57 percent and 15.3 percent,  \nrespectively, for the third quarter of 2019.  \nDuring a challenging period adversely impacted\nby the COVID-19pandemic, the Company\u2019s        \ndiversified business generated growth in net  \nrevenue and supported a provision for credit  \nlosses of $635 million including a $120       \nmillion increase in the allowance for credit  \nlosses primarily to recognize the expected    \ncredit losses of an acquired credit card      \nportfolio in the third quarter of 2020. Total \nnet revenue for the third quarter of 2020 was \n$44 million (0.7 percent) higher than the     \nthird quarter of 2019, reflecting a 3.7       \npercent increase in noninterest income,       \npartially offset by a 1.6 percent decrease in \nnet interest income. The decrease in net      \ninterest income from the third quarter of 2019\nwas primarily due to the impact of lower      \ninterest rates from a year ago, partially     \noffset by changes in deposit and funding mix, \nand loan growth. The noninterest income       \nincrease was driven by significant growth in  \nmortgage banking revenue due to refinancing   \nproduction and strong growth in commercial    \nproducts revenue due to capital markets       \nactivities. Growth in these fee categories was\npartially offset by a decline in payment      \nservices revenue and deposit service charges  \nrelated to lower consumer and commercial      \nspending. Additionally, other noninterest     \nincome declined from the third quarter of 2019\ndue to lower equity investment income, lower  \ntax-advantagedinvestment syndication revenue  \nand certain asset impairments as a result of  \nexpected branch closures. Noninterest expense \nin the third quarter of 2020 was $227 million \n(7.2 percent) higher than the third quarter of\n2019, reflecting costs related to COVID-19and \nan increase in revenue-related production     \nexpenses in the third quarter of 2020.        \nAdditionally, noninterest expense reflected an\nincrease in personnel costs and technology and\ncommunications expense related to developing  \ndigital capabilities and related business     \ninvestment, as well as an increase in other   \nnoninterest expense, partially offset by lower\nmarketing and business development expense and\nlower professional services expense. The      \nprovision for credit losses for the third     \nquarter of 2020 of $635 million was $268      \nmillion (73.0 percent) higher than the third  \nquarter of 2019, reflecting an increase in the\nallowance for credit losses during the third  \nquarter of 2020 primarily to recognize the    \nexpected losses within the acquired State Farm\nBank credit card portfolio. Net charge-offs in\nthe third quarter of 2020 were $515 million,  \ncompared with $352 million in the third       \nquarter of 2019. Refer to \u201cCorporate Risk     \nProfile\u201d for further information on the       \nprovision for credit losses, net charge-offs, \nnonperforming assets and other factors        \nconsidered by the Company in assessing the    \ncredit quality of the loan portfolio and      \nestablishing the allowance for credit losses. \nNet income attributable to U.S. Bancorp for   \nthe first nine months of 2020 was $3.4        \nbillion, or $2.11 per diluted common share,   \ncompared with $5.4 billion, or $3.25 per      \ndiluted common share, for the first nine      \nmonths of 2019. Return on average assets and  \nreturn on average common equity were 0.87     \npercent and 9.3 percent, respectively, for the\nfirst nine months of 2020, compared with 1.54 \npercent and 14.9 percent, respectively, for   \nthe first nine months of 2019. Total net      \nrevenue for the first nine months of 2020 was \n$255 million (1.5 percent) higher than the    \nfirst nine months of 2019, reflecting a 6.2   \npercent increase in noninterest income,       \npartially offset by a 2.0 percent decrease in \nnet interest income. The decrease in net      \ninterest income from the first nine months of \n2019 was primarily due to the impact of lower \ninterest rates, partially offset by changes in\ndeposit and funding mix, and loan growth. The \nnoninterest income increase was driven by     \nsignificant growth in mortgage banking revenue\nand commercial products revenue, as well as   \nincreases in trust and investment management  \nfees and gains on the sale of investment      \nsecurities. Growth in these fee categories was\npartially offset by a decline in payment      \nservices revenue and deposit service charges  \nrelated to lower consumer and commercial      \nspending. Additionally, other noninterest     \nincome declined from the prior year due to    \nlower equity investment income, lower tax-    \nadvantagedinvestment syndication revenue and  \ncertain asset impairments, partially offset by\ngains on sale of certain businesses in the    \nfirst nine months of 2020. Noninterest expense\nin the first nine months of 2020 was $621     \nmillion (6.6 percent) higher than the first   \nnine months of 2019, reflecting costs related \nto COVID-19and an increase in revenue-related \nproduction expenses in the first nine months  \nof 2020. Additionally, noninterest expense    \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    3  \n                     \nreflected an increase in personnel costs and  \ntechnology and communications expense related \nto developing digital capabilities and related\nbusiness investment, as well as an increase in\nother noninterest expense, partially offset by\nlower marketing and business development      \nexpense and lower professional services       \nexpense. The provision for credit losses for  \nthe first nine months of 2020 of $3.4 billion \nwas $2.3 billion higher than the first nine   \nmonths of 2019, reflecting an increase in the \nallowance for credit losses during the first  \nnine months of 2020 due to deteriorating      \neconomic conditions driven by the impact of   \nCOVID-19on the domestic and global economies. \nNet charge-offs in the first nine months of   \n2020 were $1.3 billion, compared with $1.1    \nbillion in the first nine months of 2019.     \nRefer to \u201cCorporate Risk Profile\u201d for further \ninformation on the provision for credit       \nlosses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets \nand other factors considered by the Company in\nassessing the credit quality of the loan      \nportfolio and establishing the allowance for  \ncredit losses. STATEMENT OF INCOME ANALYSIS   \nNet Interest IncomeNet interest income, on a  \ntaxable-equivalent basis, was $3.3 billion in \nthe third quarter and $9.7 billion in the     \nfirst nine months of 2020, representing       \ndecreases of $54 million (1.6 percent) and    \n$201 million (2.0 percent), respectively,     \ncompared with the same periods of 2019. The   \ndecreases were principally driven by the      \nimpact of lower interest rates from the prior \nyear, partially offset by changes in deposit  \nand funding mix, and loan growth. The Company \nexpects net interest income to be relatively  \nflat or decline slightly in the fourth quarter\nof 2020, as compared with the third quarter of\n2020, reflecting the expected continued low   \ninterest rate environment and its impact on   \nthe rates earned on reinvested securities, as \nwell as higher premium amortization, within   \nthe investment securities portfolio. Average  \nearning assets were $50.4 billion (11.6       \npercent) higher in the third quarter and $48.6\nbillion (11.4 percent) higher in the first    \nnine months of 2020, compared with the same   \nperiods of 2019, reflecting increases in      \nloans, investment securities and other earning\nassets primarily representing cash balances.  \nThe net interest margin, on a taxable-        \nequivalent basis, in the third quarter and    \nfirst nine months of 2020 was 2.67 percent and\n2.73 percent, respectively, compared with 3.02\npercent and 3.10 percent in the third quarter \nand first nine months of 2019, respectively.  \nThe decrease in net interest margin from the  \nprior year was primarily due to the impact of \nlower interest rates, changes in the yield    \ncurve, a decision to maintain higher cash     \nbalances for liquidity and higher premium     \namortization within the investment portfolio, \npartially offset by the net benefit of changes\nin loan mix and deposit and funding mix. The  \nCompany expects downward pressure on its net  \ninterest margin in the fourth quarter of 2020 \ndue to its expectation to maintain higher     \nliquidity levels resulting from the           \nacquisition of approximately $10 billion of   \ndeposit balances from State Farm Bank in early\nOctober 2020. Refer to the \u201cConsolidated Daily\nAverage Balance Sheet and Related Yields and  \nRates\u201d tables for further information on net  \ninterest income. Average total loans in the   \nthird quarter and first nine months of 2020   \nwere $18.6 billion (6.4 percent) and $19.7    \nbillion (6.8 percent) higher, respectively,   \nthan the same periods of 2019. The increases  \nwere primarily due to higher commercial loans,\nreflecting the utilization of bank credit     \nfacilities by customers to support liquidity  \nrequirements as well as the impact of loans   \nmade under the Small Business Administration\u2019s\n(\u201cSBA\u201d) Paycheck Protection Program, along    \nwith growth in residential mortgages given the\nlower interest rate environment and higher    \nGovernment National Mortgage Association      \n(\u201cGNMA\u201d) buybacks, and higher commercial real \nestate loans. These increases were partially  \noffset by lower credit card loans reflecting  \nthe net impact of lower consumer spending     \nduring the first nine months of 2020 partially\noffset by the acquisition of the credit card  \nportfolio in the third quarter of 2020, as    \nwell as lower other retail loans. Average     \ninvestment securities in the third quarter and\nfirst nine months of 2020 were $11.4 billion  \n(9.7 percent) and $7.8 billion (6.8 percent)  \nhigher, respectively, than the same periods of\n2019, primarily due to purchases of mortgage- \nbacked, U.S. Treasury and state and political \nsecurities, net of prepayments and maturities.\nAverage total deposits for the third quarter  \nand first nine months of 2020 were $55.6      \nbillion (15.9 percent) and $47.0 billion (13.7\npercent) higher, respectively, than the same  \nperiods of 2019. Average total savings        \ndeposits for the third quarter and first nine \nmonths of 2020 were $29.3 billion (12.6       \npercent) and $33.1 billion (14.7 percent)     \nhigher, respectively, than the same periods of\nthe prior year, driven by increases in        \nConsumer and Business Banking, and Corporate  \nand Commercial Banking balances. The increase \nin average total savings deposits for the     \nfirst nine months of 2020, compared with the  \nfirst nine months of 2019, was also due to    \nhigher Wealth Management and Investment       \nServices balances. Average noninterest-bearing\ndeposits for the third quarter and first nine \nmonths of 2020 were $34.8 billion (46.6       \npercent) and $19.2 billion (26.1 percent)     \nhigher, respectively, than the same periods of\n2019, primarily due to increases in Corporate \nand Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business \nBanking, and Wealth Management and Investment \nServices balances. The growth in average total\nsavings and noninterest-bearing deposits was  \nprimarily a result of the actions by the      \nfederal government to increase liquidity in   \nthe financial system, customers maintaining   \nbalance sheet liquidity by utilizing existing \ncredit facilities and government stimulus     \nprograms. Average time deposits for the third \nquarter and first nine months of 2020 were    \n$8.5 billion (19.9 percent) and $5.3 billion  \n(11.8 percent) lower, respectively, than the  \nsame periods of the prior year, primarily     \ndriven by decreases in those deposits managed \nas an alternative to other funding sources,   \nbased largely on relative pricing and         \nliquidity characteristics.                    \n                     \n  4    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                     \n                                 \n  Table\u00a02    Noninterest Income  \n                                 \n                                              \n         \u2026                  N\u2026                \n         \u2026                  M\u2026                \n         \u2026                  E\u2026                \n         \u2026                  S\u2026                \n         \u2026                  30                \n         \u2026    2\u2026    \u2026       2\u2026    \u2026    P\u2026     \n                    \u2026                  C\u2026     \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026    $     $             $                \n    \u2026    \u2026    3\u2026    \u2026  %    9\u2026    \u2026    (\u2026  \u2026  \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026    \u2026    1\u2026    \u2026  )    3\u2026    \u2026    (\u2026  )  \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026    \u2026    4\u2026    \u2026  )    9\u2026    \u2026    (\u2026  )  \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026    \u2026    4\u2026    \u2026       1\u2026    \u2026    4\u2026     \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026    \u2026    2\u2026    \u2026  )    5\u2026    \u2026    (\u2026  )  \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026    \u2026    1\u2026    \u2026       4\u2026    \u2026    (\u2026  )  \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026    \u2026    2\u2026    \u2026       9\u2026    \u2026    2\u2026     \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026    \u2026    2\u2026    *       1\u2026    \u2026     *     \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026    \u2026    46    \u2026       1\u2026    \u2026    2\u2026     \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026    \u2026    25    \u2026  )    1\u2026    \u2026     *     \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026                                         \n         \u2026    2\u2026    \u2026  )    5\u2026    \u2026    (\u2026  )  \n    \u2026                                         \n    \u2026    \u2026    $\u2026    \u2026  %    $\u2026    \u2026    6\u2026  %  \n    \u2026                                         \n                                              \n                     \n  *  Not meaningful  \n                     \nProvision for Credit Losses The provision for \ncredit losses was $635 million for the third  \nquarter and $3.4 billion for the first nine   \nmonths of 2020, representing increases of $268\nmillion (73.0 percent) and $2.3 billion,      \nrespectively, from the same periods of 2019.  \nIn March 2020 economic conditions began to    \ndeteriorate, and continued to worsen in the   \nsecond quarter of 2020, due to the impact of  \nthe COVID-19health crisis. During the third   \nquarter of 2020, economic conditions began to \nmoderate as economic projections for both the \ngross domestic product and unemployment levels\nimproved from the second quarter. The Company \nrecognized an increase of $2.0 billion in the \nallowance for credit losses during the first  \nnine months of 2020 due to the deteriorating  \nand ongoing effects of these adverse economic \nconditions. The Company recognized an increase\nof $120 million in the allowance for credit   \nlosses during the third quarter of 2020,      \nprimarily reflecting the expected losses      \nwithin the State Farm Bank credit card        \nportfolio acquired during the period. Net     \ncharge-offs increased $163 million (46.3      \npercent) and $276 million (25.8 percent) in   \nthe third quarter and first nine months of    \n2020, respectively, compared with the same    \nperiods of the prior year, primarily due to   \nhigher commercial loan, commercial real estate\nloan and retail leasing net charge-offs,      \npartially offset by a decrease in other retail\nloan net charge-offs. Refer to \u201cCorporate Risk\nProfile\u201d for further information on the       \nprovision for credit losses, net charge-offs, \nnonperforming assets and other factors        \nconsidered by the Company in assessing the    \ncredit quality of the loan portfolio and      \nestablishing the allowance for credit losses. \nNoninterest Income Noninterest income was $2.7\nbillion in the third quarter and $7.9 billion \nin the first nine months of 2020, representing\nincreases of $98 million (3.7 percent) and    \n$456 million (6.2 percent), respectively,     \ncompared with the same periods of 2019. The   \nincreases from a year ago reflected higher    \nmortgage banking revenue, commercial products \nrevenue and trust and investment management   \nfees, partially offset by lower payment       \nservices revenue, deposit service charges and \nother noninterest income. The increase in     \nnoninterest income in the first nine months of\n2020, compared with the first nine months of  \n2019, was also due to higher gains on sales of\ninvestment securities. Mortgage banking       \nrevenue increased due to higher mortgage loan \nproduction and stronger gain on sale margins, \npartially offset by declines in mortgage      \nservicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) valuations, net of  \nhedging activities. The Company expects       \nmortgage banking revenue to decline in the    \nfourth quarter of 2020, as compared with the  \nthird quarter of 2020, reflecting slower      \nrefinancing activity for the industry and     \nseasonality of home sales. Commercial products\nrevenue increased primarily due to higher     \ncorporate bond issuance fees and trading      \nrevenue. Trust and investment management fees \nwere higher due to business growth and        \nfavorable market conditions over the past     \nyear. Payment services fee revenue decreased  \nreflecting lower merchant processing services \nrevenue and corporate payment products        \nrevenue, driven by lower sales volume due to  \nthe worldwide impact of the COVID-19pandemic  \non consumer and business spending. Credit and \ndebit card revenue was higher in the third    \nquarter of 2020, compared with the third      \nquarter of 2019, reflecting significantly     \nhigher prepaid card fees related to the       \ndelayed impact of government stimulus programs\nadopted in the second quarter of 2020. Payment\nservices revenue is likely to continue to be  \nadversely affected through the remainder of   \n2020 due to reduced consumer and business     \nspending activity, as well as lower expected  \nprepaid card volume in the fourth quarter of  \n2020, as compared with the third quarter of   \n2020. Deposit service charges decreased       \nprimarily due to lower volume. Other          \nnoninterest income decreased due to lower     \nequity investment income, lower tax-          \nadvantagedinvestment syndication revenue, and \ncertain asset impairments as a result of      \nexpected branch closures.

The categories of expense       \nimpacted primarily include higher personnel   \nexpense, technology and communications        \nexpense, and other noninterest expense,       \npartially offset by lower marketing and       \nbusiness development expense. Compensation    \nexpense increased due to the impacts of merit \nincreases and higher variable compensation    \nrelated to business production within the     \nmortgage banking and fixed income capital     \nmarkets businesses. Employee benefits expense \nincreased primarily due to higher pension     \nexpense. Technology and communications expense\nincreased primarily due to capital            \nexpenditures supporting business growth and   \nthe impact of increased call center volume    \nrelated to prepaid cards. Other noninterest   \nexpense increased, reflecting $49 million and \n$228 million of expenses in the third quarter \nand first nine months of 2020, respectively,  \nrelated to COVID-19,higher FDIC insurance     \nexpense driven by an increase in the          \nassessment base, and higher state franchise   \ntaxes. The increase in other noninterest      \nexpense in the first nine months of 2020,     \ncompared with the first nine months of 2019,  \nwas partially offset by lower costs related to\ntax-advantagedprojects in 2020. Incremental   \ncosts related to COVID-19include increased    \nliabilities driven by the Company\u2019s exposure  \nas a credit card processor to charge-back risk\non undelivered goods and services, including  \nprepaid airline tickets, as well as expenses  \nrelated to paying premium compensation to     \nfront-line workers and providing a safe       \nworking environment for employees.            \nProfessional services expense decreased       \nprimarily due to business initiatives         \ncompleted in 2019, while marketing and        \nbusiness development expense decreased due to \nthe timing of marketing campaigns and a       \nreduction in travel as a result of            \nCOVID-19.The Company expects its noninterest  \nexpenses to be relatively stable for the      \nfourth quarter of 2020, as compared with the  \nthird quarter of 2020. Income Tax Expense The \nprovision for income taxes was $347 million   \n(an effective rate of 18.0 percent) for the   \nthird quarter and $671 million (an effective  \nrate of 16.2 percent) for the first nine      \nmonths of 2020, compared with $467 million (an\neffective rate of 19.6 percent) and $1.3      \nbillion (an effective rate of 19.2 percent)   \nfor the same periods of 2019. The reduced tax \nrates for 2020 were primarily a result of     \nreduced pretax income being impacted by       \ncurrent economic conditions, including the    \nhigher provision for credit losses.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS Loans The  \nCompany\u2019s loan portfolio was $307.0 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2020, compared with $296.1      \nbillion at December 31, 2019, an increase of  \n$10.9 billion (3.7 percent). The increase was \ndriven by higher commercial loans, residential\nmortgages, commercial real estate loans and   \nother retail loans, partially offset by lower \ncredit card loans. Commercial loans increased \n$6.9 billion (6.6 percent) at September 30,   \n2020, compared with December 31, 2019,        \nreflecting the impact of loans made under the \nSBA\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program.            \n                     \n  6    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                     \n                                              \n  Table\u00a04    Available-for-Sale Investment    \n             Securities                       \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Information related to asset and       \n       mortgage-backed securities included    \n  (a)  above is presented based upon          \n       weighted-average maturities that take  \n       into account anticipated future        \n       prepayments.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Information related to obligations of  \n       state and political subdivisions is    \n       presented based upon yield to first    \n  (b)  optional call date if the security is  \n       purchased at a premium, and yield to   \n       maturity if the security is purchased  \n       at par or a discount.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Maturity calculations for obligations  \n       of state and political subdivisions    \n       are based on the first optional call   \n  (c)  date for securities with a fair value  \n       above par and the contractual          \n       maturity date for securities with a    \n       fair value equal to or below par.      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Yields on investment securities are    \n       computed based on amortized cost       \n       balances. Weighted-average yields for  \n  (d)  obligations of state and political     \n       subdivisions are presented on a        \n       fully-taxable equivalent basis based   \n       on a federal income tax rate of 21\u00a0    \n       percent.                               \n                                              \nResidential mortgages held in the loan        \nportfolio increased $6.2 billion (8.8 percent)\nat September 30, 2020, compared with December \n31, 2019, due to higher mortgage loan         \nproduction given the lower interest rate      \nenvironment, and higher GNMA buybacks during  \nthe first nine months of 2020. Residential    \nmortgages originated and placed in the        \nCompany\u2019s loan portfolio include well-secured \njumbo mortgages and branch-originated first   \nlien home equity loans to borrowers with high \ncredit quality. Commercial real estate loans  \nincreased $634 million (1.6 percent) at       \nSeptember 30, 2020, compared with December 31,\n2019, primarily the result of new             \noriginations, partially offset by customers   \npaying down balances. Other retail loans      \nincreased $36 million (0.1 percent) at        \nSeptember 30, 2020, compared with December 31,\n2019, due to an increase in installment loans,\npartially offset by decreases in home equity  \nloans, auto loans, revolving credit balances  \nand retail leasing balances. Credit card loans\ndecreased $2.9 billion (11.7 percent) at      \nSeptember 30, 2020, compared with December 31,\n2019, reflecting reduced consumer spending in \n2020 driven by the impact of                  \nCOVID-19,partially offset by the acquisition  \nof the State Farm Bank credit card portfolio  \nin the third quarter of 2020. The Company     \ngenerally retains portfolio loans through     \nmaturity; however, the Company\u2019s intent may   \nchange over time based upon various factors   \nsuch as ongoing asset/liability management    \nactivities, assessment of product             \nprofitability, credit risk, liquidity needs,  \nand capital implications. If the Company\u2019s    \nintent or ability to hold an existing         \nportfolio loan changes, it is transferred to  \nloans held for sale. Loans Held for Sale Loans\nheld for sale, consisting primarily of        \nresidential mortgages to be sold in the       \nsecondary market, were $7.6 billion at        \nSeptember 30, 2020, compared with $5.6 billion\nat December 31, 2019. The increase in loans   \nheld for sale was principally due to a higher \nlevel of mortgage loan closings in the third  \nquarter of 2020 given the lower interest rate \nenvironment, compared with the fourth quarter \nof 2019. Almost all of the residential        \nmortgage loans the Company originates or      \npurchases for sale follow guidelines that     \nallow the loans to be sold into existing,     \nhighly liquid secondary markets; in particular\nin government agency transactions and to      \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d).    \nInvestment Securities Available-for-          \nsaleinvestment securities totaled $134.0      \nbillion at September 30, 2020, compared with  \n$122.6 billion at December 31, 2019. The $11.4\nbillion (9.3 percent) increase was primarily  \ndue to $8.6 billion of net investment         \npurchases and a $2.8 billion favorable change \nin net unrealized gains (losses) on available-\nfor-saleinvestment securities. The Company had\nno outstanding investment securities          \nclassified as held-to-maturityat September 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019. The Company\u2019s     \navailable-for-saleinvestment securities are   \ncarried at fair value with changes in fair    \nvalue reflected in other comprehensive income \n(loss) unless a portion of a security\u2019s       \nunrealized loss is related to credit and an   \nallowance for credit losses is necessary. At  \nSeptember 30, 2020, the Company\u2019s net         \nunrealized gains on available-for-            \nsaleinvestment securities were $3.3 billion,  \ncompared with $496 million at December 31,    \n2019. The favorable change in net unrealized  \ngains was primarily due to increases in the   \nfair value of mortgage-backed, U.S. Treasury, \nand state and political securities as a result\nof changes in interest rates. Gross unrealized\nlosses on available-for-saleinvestment        \nsecurities totaled $34 million at September   \n30, 2020, compared with $448 million at       \nDecember 31, 2019. At                         \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    7  \n                     \nSeptember 30, 2020, the Company had no plans  \nto sell securities with unrealized losses, and\nbelieves it is more likely than not that it   \nwould not be required to sell such securities \nbefore recovery of their amortized cost. Refer\nto Notes 3 and 14 in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for further information  \non investment securities. Deposits Total      \ndeposits were $413.2 billion at September 30, \n2020, compared with $361.9 billion at December\n31, 2019. The $51.3 billion (14.2 percent)    \nincrease in total deposits reflected increases\nin noninterest-bearing and total savings      \ndeposits, partially offset by a decrease in   \ntime deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits   \nincreased $39.0 billion (51.6 percent) at     \nSeptember 30, 2020, compared with December 31,\n2019, primarily due to higher Corporate and   \nCommercial Banking, Consumer and Business     \nBanking, and Wealth Management and Investment \nServices balances. Interest checking balances \nincreased $9.7 billion (12.7 percent), while  \nsavings account balances increased $7.0       \nbillion (14.9 percent), both driven by higher \nConsumer and Business Banking balances. Money \nmarket deposit balances increased $5.9 billion\n(4.9 percent) at September 30, 2020, compared \nwith December 31, 2019, primarily due to      \nhigher Corporate and Commercial Banking, and  \nConsumer and Business Banking balances,       \npartially offset by a decrease in Wealth      \nManagement and Investment Services balances.  \nThe growth in noninterest-bearing and total   \nsavings deposits was primarily a result of the\neconomic impact of the COVID-19pandemic on the\nworld economy resulting in actions by the     \nfederal government to increase liquidity in   \nthe financial system, customers maintaining   \nbalance sheet liquidity by utilizing existing \ncredit facilities and government stimulus     \nprograms. Time deposits decreased $10.3       \nbillion (24.0 percent) at September 30, 2020, \ncompared with December 31, 2019, driven by a  \ndecrease in those deposits managed as an      \nalternative to other funding sources, based   \nlargely on relative pricing and liquidity     \ncharacteristics, along with a decrease in     \nConsumer and Business Banking balances.       \nBorrowings The Company utilizes both short-   \nterm and long-term borrowings as part of its  \nasset/liability management and funding        \nstrategies. Short-term borrowings, which      \ninclude federal funds purchased, commercial   \npaper, repurchase agreements, borrowings      \nsecured by high-grade assets and other short- \nterm borrowings, were $13.7 billion at        \nSeptember 30, 2020, compared with $23.7       \nbillion at December 31, 2019. The $10.0       \nbillion (42.2 percent) decrease in short-term \nborrowings was primarily due to a decrease in \nshort-term Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d)    \nadvances and other short-term borrowings      \nbalances, partially offset by higher          \nrepurchase agreement balances. Long-term debt \nwas $42.4 billion at September 30, 2020,      \ncompared with $40.2 billion at December 31,   \n2019. The $2.3 billion (5.7 percent) increase \nwas primarily due to $3.3 billion of bank note\nand $2.8 billion of medium-term note          \nissuances, partially offset by $4.5 billion of\nbank note repayments and maturities. Refer to \nthe \u201cLiquidity Risk Management\u201d section for   \ndiscussion of liquidity management of the     \nCompany. CORPORATE RISK PROFILE Overview      \nManaging risks is an essential part of        \nsuccessfully operating a financial services   \ncompany. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors has \napproved a risk management framework which    \nestablishes governance and risk management    \nrequirements for all risk-taking activities.  \nThis framework includes Company and business  \nline risk appetite statements which set       \nboundaries for the types and amount of risk   \nthat may be undertaken in pursuing business   \nobjectives and initiatives. The Board of      \nDirectors, primarily through its Risk         \nManagement Committee, oversees performance    \nrelative to the risk management framework,    \nrisk appetite statements, and other policy    \nrequirements. The Executive Risk Committee    \n(\u201cERC\u201d), which is chaired by the Chief Risk   \nOfficer and includes the Chief Executive      \nOfficer and other members of the executive    \nmanagement team, oversees execution against   \nthe risk management framework and risk        \nappetite statements. The ERC focuses on       \ncurrent and emerging risks, including         \nstrategic and reputation risks, by directing  \ntimely and comprehensive actions. Senior      \noperating committees have also been           \nestablished, each responsible for overseeing a\nspecified category of risk. The Company\u2019s most\nprominent risk exposures are credit, interest \nrate, market, liquidity, operational,         \ncompliance, strategic, and reputation.        \nLeveraging the Company\u2019s risk management      \nframework, the specific impacts of COVID-19and\nrelated risks are identified for each of the  \nmost prominent exposures. Oversight and       \ngovernance is managed through a centralized   \ncommand center which escalates through the    \nERC. The Board of Directors also oversees the \nCompany\u2019s responsiveness to the               \nCOVID-19pandemic. Credit risk is the risk of  \nnot collecting the interest and/or the        \nprincipal balance of a loan, investment or    \nderivative contract when it is due. Interest  \nrate risk is the potential reduction of net   \ninterest income or market valuations as a     \nresult of changes in interest rates. Market   \nrisk arises from fluctuations in interest     \nrates, foreign exchange rates, and security   \nprices that may result in changes in the      \nvalues of financial                           \n                     \n  8    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                     \ninstruments, such as trading and available-   \nfor-salesecurities, mortgage loans held for   \nsale (\u201cMLHFS\u201d), MSRs and derivatives that are \naccounted for on a fair value basis. Liquidity\nrisk is the possible inability to fund        \nobligations or new business at a reasonable   \ncost and in a timely manner. Operational risk \nis the risk to current or projected financial \ncondition arising from inadequate or failed   \ninternal processes or systems, people, or     \nadverse external events, including the risk of\nloss resulting from breaches in data security.\nOperational risk can also include the risk of \nloss due to failures by third parties with    \nwhich the Company does business. Compliance   \nrisk is the risk that the Company may suffer  \nlegal or regulatory sanctions, financial      \nlosses, and reputational damage if it fails to\nadhere to compliance requirements. Strategic  \nrisk is the risk to current or projected      \nfinancial condition arising from adverse      \nbusiness decisions, poor implementation of    \nbusiness decisions, or lack of responsiveness \nto changes in the banking industry and        \noperating environment. Reputation risk is the \nrisk to current or anticipated earnings,      \ncapital, or franchise or enterprise value     \narising from negative public opinion. This    \nrisk may impair the Company\u2019s competitiveness \nby affecting its ability to establish new     \nrelationships or services, offer new services \nor continue serving existing relationships. In\naddition to the risks identified above, other \nrisk factors exist that may impact the        \nCompany. Refer to \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this      \nreport and in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on  \nForm 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2019,\nfor a detailed discussion of these factors.   \nThe Company\u2019s Board and management-level      \ngovernance committees are supported by a      \n\u201cthree lines of defense\u201d model for            \nestablishing effective checks and balances.   \nThe first line of defense, the business lines,\nmanages risks in conformity with established  \nlimits and policy requirements. In turn,      \nbusiness line leaders and their risk officers \nestablish programs to ensure conformity with  \nthese limits and policy requirements. The     \nsecond line of defense, which includes the    \nChief Risk Officer\u2019s organization as well as  \npolicy and oversight activities of corporate  \nsupport functions, translates risk appetite   \nand strategy into actionable risk limits and  \npolicies. The second line of defense monitors \nfirst line of defense conformity with limits  \nand policies, and provides reporting and      \nescalation of emerging risks and other        \nconcerns to senior management and the Risk    \nManagement Committee of the Board of          \nDirectors. The third line of defense, internal\naudit, is responsible for providing the Audit \nCommittee of the Board of Directors and senior\nmanagement with independent assessment and    \nassurance regarding the effectiveness of the  \nCompany\u2019s governance, risk management and     \ncontrol processes. Management regularly       \nprovides reports to the Risk Management       \nCommittee of the Board of Directors. The Risk \nManagement Committee discusses with management\nthe Company\u2019s risk management performance, and\nprovides a summary of key risks to the entire \nBoard of Directors, covering the status of    \nexisting matters, areas of potential future   \nconcern and specific information on certain   \ntypes of loss events. The Risk Management     \nCommittee considers quarterly reports by      \nmanagement assessing the Company\u2019s performance\nrelative to the risk appetite statements and  \nthe associated risk limits, including:        \n                                              \n       Macroeconomic environment and other    \n       qualitative considerations, such as    \n  \u2022    regulatory and compliance changes,     \n       litigation developments, and           \n       technology and cybersecurity;          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit measures, including adversely   \n  \u2022    rated and nonperforming loans,         \n       leveraged transactions, credit         \n       concentrations and lending limits;     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Interest rate and market risk,         \n  \u2022    including market value and net income  \n       simulation, and trading-related Value  \n       at Risk (\u201cVaR\u201d);                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Liquidity risk, including funding      \n  \u2022    projections under various stressed     \n       scenarios;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       Operational and compliance risk,       \n       including losses stemming from events  \n       such as fraud, processing errors,      \n       control breaches, breaches in data     \n  \u2022    security or adverse business           \n       decisions, as well as reporting on     \n       technology performance, and various    \n       legal and regulatory compliance        \n       measures;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Capital ratios and projections,        \n  \u2022    including regulatory measures and      \n       stressed scenarios; and                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Strategic and reputation risk          \n  \u2022    considerations, impacts and            \n       responses.                             \n                                              \nCredit Risk Management The Company\u2019s strategy \nfor credit risk management includes well-     \ndefined, centralized credit policies, uniform \nunderwriting criteria, and ongoing risk       \nmonitoring and review processes for all       \ncommercial and consumer credit exposures. In  \nevaluating its credit risk, the Company       \nconsiders changes, if any, in underwriting    \nactivities, the loan portfolio composition    \n(including product mix and geographic,        \nindustry or customer-specific concentrations),\ncollateral values, trends in loan performance \nand macroeconomic factors, such as changes in \nunemployment rates, gross domestic product    \nlevels and consumer bankruptcy filings, as    \nwell as the potential impact on customers and \nthe domestic economy resulting from new       \ntariffs or increases in existing tariffs, and \nthe COVID-19pandemic. The Risk Management     \nCommittee oversees the Company\u2019s credit risk  \nmanagement process.                           \n                     \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    9  \n                     \nIn addition, credit quality ratings as defined\nby the Company, are an important part of the  \nCompany\u2019s overall credit risk management and  \nevaluation of its allowance for credit losses.\nLoans with a pass rating represent those loans\nnot classified on the Company\u2019s rating scale  \nfor problem credits, as minimal risk has been \nidentified. Loans with a special mention or   \nclassified rating, including loans that are 90\ndays or more past due and still accruing,     \nnonaccrual loans, those loans considered      \ntroubled debt restructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d), and    \nloans in a junior lien position that are      \ncurrent but are behind a modified or          \ndelinquent loan in a first lien position,     \nencompass all loans held by the Company that  \nit considers to have a potential or well-     \ndefined weakness that may put full collection \nof contractual cash flows at risk. The        \nCompany\u2019s internal credit quality ratings for \nconsumer loans are primarily based on         \ndelinquency and nonperforming status, except  \nfor a limited population of larger loans      \nwithin those portfolios that are individually \nevaluated. For this limited population, the   \ndetermination of the internal credit quality  \nrating may also consider collateral value and \ncustomer cash flows. Refer to Note 4 in the   \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements for\nfurther discussion of the Company\u2019s loan      \nportfolios including internal credit quality  \nratings. In addition, refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s  \nDiscussion and Analysis \u2014 Credit Risk         \nManagement\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on \nForm 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2019,\nfor a more detailed discussion on credit risk \nmanagement processes. The Company manages its \ncredit risk, in part, through diversification \nof its loan portfolio which is achieved       \nthrough limit setting by product type         \ncriteria, such as industry, and identification\nof credit concentrations. As part of its      \nnormal business activities, the Company offers\na broad array of lending products. The Company\ncategorizes its loan portfolio into two       \nsegments, which is the level at which it      \ndevelops and documents a systematic           \nmethodology to determine the allowance for    \ncredit losses. The Company\u2019s two loan         \nportfolio segments are commercial lending and \nconsumer lending. The commercial lending      \nsegment includes loans and leases made to     \nsmall business, middle market, large          \ncorporate, commercial real estate, financial  \ninstitution, non-profitand public sector      \ncustomers. Key risk characteristics relevant  \nto commercial lending segment loans include   \nthe industry and geography of the borrower\u2019s  \nbusiness, purpose of the loan, repayment      \nsource, borrower\u2019s debt capacity and financial\nflexibility, loan covenants, and nature of    \npledged collateral, if any, as well as        \nmacroeconomic factors such as unemployment    \nrates, gross domestic product levels,         \ncorporate bond spreads and long-term interest \nrates, all of which have been impacted by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. These risk characteristics,\namong others, are considered in determining   \nestimates about the likelihood of default by  \nthe borrowers and the severity of loss in the \nevent of default. The Company considers these \nrisk characteristics in assigning internal    \nrisk ratings to, or forecasting losses on,    \nthese loans, which are the significant factors\nin determining the allowance for credit losses\nfor loans in the commercial lending segment.  \nThe consumer lending segment represents loans \nand leases made to consumer customers,        \nincluding residential mortgages, credit card  \nloans, and other retail loans such as         \nrevolving consumer lines, auto loans and      \nleases, home equity loans and lines, and      \nstudent loans, a run-offportfolio. Home equity\nor second mortgage loans are junior lien      \nclosed-endaccounts fully disbursed at         \norigination. These loans typically are fixed  \nrate loans, secured by residential real       \nestate, with a 10-or 15-yearfixed payment     \namortization schedule. Home equity lines are  \nrevolving accounts giving the borrower the    \nability to draw and repay balances repeatedly,\nup to a maximum commitment, and are secured by\nresidential real estate. These include        \naccounts in either a first or junior lien     \nposition. Typical terms on home equity lines  \nin the portfolio are variable rates           \nbenchmarked to the prime rate, with a 10-or   \n15-yeardraw period during which a minimum     \npayment is equivalent to the monthly interest,\nfollowed by a 20-or 10-yearamortization       \nperiod, respectively. At September 30, 2020,  \nsubstantially all of the Company\u2019s home equity\nlines were in the draw period. Approximately  \n$1.4 billion, or 12 percent, of the           \noutstanding home equity line balances at      \nSeptember 30, 2020, will enter the            \namortization period within the next 36 months.\nKey risk characteristics relevant to consumer \nlending segment loans primarily relate to the \nborrowers\u2019 capacity and willingness to repay  \nand include unemployment rates, consumer      \nbankruptcy filings and other macroeconomic    \nfactors, customer payment history and credit  \nscores, and in some cases, updated loan-to-   \nvalue(\u201cLTV\u201d) information reflecting current   \nmarket conditions on real estate-based loans. \nThese and other risk characteristics,         \nincluding elevated risk resulting from the    \nCOVID-19pandemic, are reflected in forecasts  \nof delinquency levels, bankruptcies and losses\nwhich are the primary factors in determining  \nthe allowance for credit losses for the       \nconsumer lending segment. The Company further \ndisaggregates its loan portfolio segments into\nvarious classes based on their underlying risk\ncharacteristics. The two classes within the   \ncommercial lending segment are commercial     \nloans and commercial real estate loans. The   \nthree classes within the consumer lending     \nsegment are residential mortgages, credit card\nloans and other retail loans.                 \n                      \n  10    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nThe Company\u2019s consumer lending segment        \nutilizes several distinct business processes  \nand channels to originate consumer credit,    \nincluding traditional branch lending, mobile  \nand on-linebanking, indirect lending,         \ncorrespondent banks and loan brokers. Each    \ndistinct underwriting and origination activity\nmanages unique credit risk characteristics and\nprices its loan production commensurate with  \nthe differing risk profiles. Residential      \nmortgage originations are generally limited to\nprime borrowers and are performed through the \nCompany\u2019s branches, loan production offices,  \nmobile and on-lineservices and a wholesale    \nnetwork of originators. The Company may retain\nresidential mortgage loans it originates on   \nits balance sheet or sell the loans into the  \nsecondary market while retaining the servicing\nrights and customer relationships. Utilizing  \nthe secondary markets enables the Company to  \neffectively reduce its credit and other       \nasset/liability risks. For residential        \nmortgages that are retained in the Company\u2019s  \nportfolio and for home equity and second      \nmortgages, credit risk is also diversified by \ngeography and managed by adherence to LTV and \nborrower credit criteria during the           \nunderwriting process. The Company estimates   \nupdated LTV information on its outstanding    \nresidential mortgages quarterly, based on a   \nmethod that combines automated valuation model\nupdates and relevant home price indices. LTV  \nis the ratio of the loan\u2019s outstanding        \nprincipal balance to the current estimate of  \nproperty value. For home equity and second    \nmortgages, combined loan-to-value(\u201cCLTV\u201d) is  \nthe combination of the first mortgage original\nprincipal balance and the second lien         \noutstanding principal balance, relative to the\ncurrent estimate of property value. Certain   \nloans do not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily   \ndue to lack of availability of relevant       \nautomated valuation model and/or home price   \nindices values, or lack of necessary valuation\ndata on acquired loans. The following tables  \nprovide summary information of residential    \nmortgages and home equity and second mortgages\nby LTV at September 30, 2020:                 \n                                              \n  Res\u2026                                        \n  Mor\u2026    Inte\u2026                      Per\u2026     \n  (Do\u2026     Only    Amor\u2026    Total      of     \n  in                                 Tot\u2026     \n  Mil\u2026                                        \n  Loa\u2026                                        \n  Less                                        \n  than                                        \n  or      $3,0\u2026    $58,\u2026    $61,\u2026    80.0  %  \n  equ\u2026                                        \n  to                                          \n  80%                                         \n  Over                                        \n  80%        11    5,472    5,483     7.1     \n  thr\u2026                                        \n  90%                                         \n  Over                                        \n  90%         \u2014      518      518      .7     \n  thr\u2026                                        \n  100%                                        \n  Over        \u2014      118      118      .2     \n  100%                                        \n  No                                          \n  LTV         \u2014       18       18       \u2014     \n  ava\u2026                                        \n  Loa\u2026                                        \n  pur\u2026                                        \n  from                                        \n  GNMA        \u2014    9,203    9,203    12.0     \n  mor\u2026                                        \n  poo\u2026                                        \n  (a)                                         \n  Tot\u2026    $3,0\u2026    $73,\u2026    $76,\u2026    100\u2026  %  \n  (b)                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents loans purchased from        \n       Government National Mortgage           \n       Association (\u201cGNMA\u201d) mortgage pools    \n  (a)  whose payments are primarily insured   \n       by the Federal Housing Administration  \n       or guaranteed by the United States     \n       Department of Veterans Affairs.        \n                                              \n                                              \n       At September\u00a030, 2020, approximately   \n  (b)  $540\u00a0million of residential mortgage   \n       balances were consideredsub-prime.     \n                                              \n                                              \n  Home                                        \n  Equ\u2026                                        \n  and                                Per\u2026     \n  Sec\u2026    Lines    Loans    Total      of     \n  Mor\u2026                               Tot\u2026     \n  (Do\u2026                                        \n  in                                          \n  Mil\u2026                                        \n  Loa\u2026                                        \n  Less                                        \n  than                                        \n  or      $10,\u2026        $    $10,\u2026    83.1  %  \n  equ\u2026               764                      \n  to                                          \n  80%                                         \n  Over                                        \n  80%     1,320      462    1,782    13.5     \n  thr\u2026                                        \n  90%                                         \n  Over                                        \n  90%       210       47      257     2.0     \n  thr\u2026                                        \n  100%                                        \n  Over       90        7       97      .7     \n  100%                                        \n  No                                          \n  LTV\u2026       91        4       95      .7     \n  ava\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026    $11,\u2026    $1,2\u2026    $13,\u2026    100\u2026  %  \n  (a)                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       At September\u00a030, 2020, approximately   \n  (a)  $54\u00a0million of home equity and second  \n       mortgage balances were                 \n       consideredsub-prime.                   \n                                              \nHome equity and second mortgages were $13.2   \nbillion at September 30, 2020, compared with  \n$15.0 billion at December 31, 2019, and       \nincluded $3.5 billion of home equity lines in \na first lien position and $9.7 billion of home\nequity and second mortgage loans and lines in \na junior lien position.

The Company measures              \ndelinquencies, both including and excluding   \nnonperforming loans, to enable comparability  \nwith other companies. Accruing loans 90 days  \nor more past due totaled $461 million at      \nSeptember 30, 2020, compared with $605 million\nat December 31, 2019.

\ndifficulties or is expected to experience     \ndifficulties in the near-term.

The Company continues to work with      \ncustomers to modify loans for borrowers who   \nare experiencing financial difficulties. Many \nof the Company\u2019s TDRs are determined on a     \ncase-by-casebasis in connection with ongoing  \nloan collection processes.

Commercial lending segment TDRs      \ngenerally include extensions of the maturity  \ndate and may be accompanied by an increase or \ndecrease to the interest rate. The Company may\nalso work with the borrower to make other     \nchanges to the loan to mitigate losses, such  \nas obtaining additional collateral and/or     \nguarantees to support the loan. The Company   \nhas also implemented certain residential      \nmortgage loan restructuring programs that may \nresult in TDRs.

Under these programs, the  \nCompany offers qualifying homeowners the      \nopportunity to permanently modify their loan  \nand achieve more affordable monthly payments  \nby providing loan concessions. These          \nconcessions may include adjustments to        \ninterest rates, conversion of adjustable rates\nto fixed rates, extensions of maturity dates  \nor deferrals of payments, capitalization of   \naccrued interest and/or outstanding advances, \nor in limited situations, partial forgiveness \nof loan principal. In most instances,         \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    13  \n                      \nparticipation in residential mortgage loan    \nrestructuring programs requires the customer  \nto complete a short-term trial period. A      \npermanent loan modification is contingent on  \nthe customer successfully completing the trial\nperiod arrangement, and the loan documents are\nnot modified until that time. The Company     \nreports loans in a trial period arrangement as\nTDRs and continues to report them as TDRs     \nafter the trial period. Credit card and other \nretail loan TDRs are generally part of        \ndistinct restructuring programs providing     \ncustomers modification solutions over a       \nspecified time period, generally up to 60     \nmonths. In accordance with regulatory         \nguidance, the Company considers secured       \nconsumer loans that have had debt discharged  \nthrough bankruptcy where the borrower has not \nreaffirmed the debt to be TDRs. If the loan   \namount exceeds the collateral value, the loan \nis charged down to collateral value and the   \nremaining amount is reported as nonperforming.\nLoan modifications or concessions granted to  \ncustomers resulting directly from the effects \nof the COVID-19pandemic, who were otherwise in\ncurrent payment status, are not considered to \nbe TDRs. The following table provides a       \nsummary of TDRs by loan class, including the  \ndelinquency status for TDRs that continue to  \naccrue interest and TDRs included in          \nnonperforming

be \nTDRs, in limited circumstances, to assist     \nborrowers experiencing temporary hardships.   \nShort-term consumer lending modification      \nprograms include payment reductions, deferrals\nof up to three past due payments, and the     \nability to return to current status if the    \nborrower makes required payments. The Company \nmay also make short-term modifications to     \ncommercial lending loans, with the most common\nmodification being an extension of the        \nmaturity date of three months or less. Such   \nextensions generally are used when the        \nmaturity date is imminent and the borrower is \nexperiencing some level of financial stress,  \nbut the Company believes the borrower will pay\nall contractual amounts owed. COVID-19Payment \nRelief The Company has offered payment relief,\nincluding forbearance, payment deferrals and  \nother customer accommodations, to assist      \nborrowers that have experienced financial     \nhardship resulting from the effects of the    \nCOVID-19pandemic. The majority of these       \nborrowers were not delinquent on payments at  \nthe time they received the payment relief.    \nFrom March 2020 through September 30, 2020,   \nthe Company had approved approximately 329,000\nloan modifications for these borrowers,       \nrepresenting approximately $26.9 billion. The \nloans modified consisted primarily of payment \nforbearance or deferrals of 90 days or less. A\nportion of the borrowers who received account \nmodifications are no longer participating in  \nthese payment relief programs, as the programs\nare generally short-term; and at September 30,\n2020, approximately 91,000 accounts,          \nrepresenting approximately $12.1 billion, were\ncurrently in an active payment relief program.\nThe recognition of delinquent or nonaccrual   \nloans and loan net charge-offs may be delayed \nfor those customers enrolled in these payment \nrelief programs who would have otherwise moved\ninto past due or nonaccrual status, as these  \ncustomer accounts do not continue to age      \nduring the period the payment delay is        \nprovided. The following table summarizes      \nborrowers enrolled in payment relief programs \nas a result of the COVID-19pandemic at        \nSeptember 30, 2020, as a percentage of the    \nCompany\u2019s

Nonperforming assets include          \nnonaccrual loans, restructured loans not      \nperforming in accordance with modified terms  \nand not accruing interest, restructured loans \nthat have not met the performance period      \nrequired to return to accrual status, other   \nreal estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d) and other          \nnonperforming assets owned by the Company.    \nInterest payments collected from assets on    \nnonaccrual status are generally applied       \nagainst the principal balance and not recorded\nas income. However, interest income may be    \nrecognized for interest payments if the       \nremaining carrying amount of the loan is      \nbelieved to be collectible. At September 30,  \n2020, total nonperforming assets were $1.3    \nbillion, compared to $829 million at December \n31, 2019. The $441 million (53.2 percent)     \nincrease in nonperforming assets was driven by\nincreases in nonperforming commercial and     \ncommercial real estate loans. The ratio of    \ntotal nonperforming assets to total loans and \nother real estate was 0.41 percent at         \nSeptember 30, 2020, compared with 0.28 percent\nat December 31, 2019. The Company expects     \nnonperforming assets to increase given current\neconomic conditions. OREO was $35 million at  \nSeptember 30, 2020, compared with $78 million \nat December 31, 2019, and was related to      \nforeclosed properties that previously secured \nloan balances. These balances exclude         \nforeclosed GNMA loans whose repayments are    \nprimarily insured by the Federal Housing      \nAdministration or guaranteed by the United    \nStates Department of Veterans Affairs.

the first  \nnine months of 2020, compared with $352       \nmillion and $1.1 billion, respectively, for   \nthe same periods of 2019. The ratio of total  \nloan net charge-offs to average loans         \noutstanding on an annualized basis for the    \nthird quarter and first nine months of 2020   \nwas 0.66 percent and 0.58 percent,            \nrespectively, compared with 0.48 percent and  \n0.49 percent, respectively, for the same      \nperiods of 2019. The year-over-year increases \nin net charge-offs reflected higher commercial\nloan, commercial real estate loan and retail  \nleasing net charge-offs, partially offset by a\ndecrease in other retail loan net charge-offs.\nThe increase in retail leasing charge-offs    \nreflected the inclusion of end of term losses \non residual lease values as of January 1,     \n2020. The Company expects net charge-offs to  \nincrease given current economic conditions.   \nAnalysis and Determination of the Allowance   \nfor Credit Losses Prior to January 1, 2020,   \nthe allowance for credit losses was           \nestablished to reserve for probable and       \nestimable losses incurred in the Company\u2019s    \nloan and lease portfolio, including unfunded  \ncredit commitments. Effective January 1, 2020,\nthe Company adopted new accounting guidance   \nwhich changed previous impairment recognition \nto a model that is based on expected losses   \nrather than incurred losses. The allowance for\ncredit losses is increased through provisions \ncharged to earnings and reduced by net charge-\noffs. Management evaluates the appropriateness\nof the allowance for credit losses on a       \nquarterly basis. The allowance considers      \nexpected losses for the remaining lives of the\napplicable assets, inclusive of expected      \nrecoveries. Remaining lives of the applicable \nassets are adjusted for prepayments. Multiple \neconomic scenarios are considered over a      \nthree-year reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod, which incorporates historical loss    \nexperience in years two and three. These      \neconomic scenarios are constructed with       \ninterrelated projections of multiple economic \nvariables, and loss estimates are produced    \nthat consider the historical correlation of   \nthose economic variables with credit losses.  \nAfter the forecast period, the Company fully  \nreverts to long-term historical loss          \nexperience, adjusted for prepayments and      \ncharacteristics of the current loan and lease \nportfolio, to estimate losses over the        \nremaining lives. The economic scenarios are   \nupdated at least quarterly, and are designed  \nto provide a range of reasonable estimates,   \nwhich are both better and worse than current  \nexpectations. Scenarios are weighted based on \nthe Company\u2019s expectation of future           \nconditions. Final loss estimates also consider\nfactors affecting credit losses not reflected \nin the scenarios, due to the unique aspects of\ncurrent conditions and expectations. These    \nfactors may include, but are not limited to,  \nloan servicing practices, regulatory guidance,\nand/or fiscal and monetary policy actions.    \nBecause business processes and credit risks   \nassociated with unfunded credit commitments   \nare essentially the same as for loans, the    \nCompany utilizes similar processes to estimate\nits liability for unfunded credit commitments,\nwhich is included in other liabilities in the \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Both the allowance\nfor loan losses and the liability for unfunded\ncredit commitments are included in the        \nCompany\u2019s analysis of credit losses and       \nreported reserve ratios. The allowance        \nrecorded for credit losses utilizes forward-  \nlooking expected loss models to consider a    \nvariety of factors affecting lifetime credit  \nlosses. These factors include, but are not    \nlimited to, macroeconomic variables such as   \nunemployment rates, real estate prices, gross \ndomestic product levels, corporate bonds      \nspreads and long-term interest rate forecasts,\nas well as loan and borrower characteristics, \nsuch as internal risk ratings on              \n                      \n  18    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \ncommercial loans and consumer credit scores,  \ndelinquency status, collateral type and       \navailable valuation information, consideration\nof end-of-termlosses on lease residuals, and  \nthe remaining term of the loan, adjusted for  \nexpected prepayments. Where loans do not      \nexhibit similar risk characteristics, an      \nindividual analysis is performed to consider  \nexpected credit losses. For each loan         \nportfolio, model estimates are adjusted as    \nnecessary to consider any relevant changes in \nportfolio composition, lending policies,      \nunderwriting standards, risk management       \npractices, economic conditions or other       \nfactors that would affect the accuracy of the \nmodel. Expected credit loss estimates also    \ninclude consideration of expected cash        \nrecoveries on loans previously charged-off,or \nexpected recoveries on collateral-dependent   \nloans where recovery is expected through sale \nof the collateral. The allowance recorded for \nindividually evaluated loans greater than $5  \nmillion in the commercial lending segment is  \nbased on an analysis utilizing expected cash  \nflows discounted using the original effective \ninterest rate, the observable market price of \nthe loan, or the fair value of the collateral,\nless selling costs, for collateral-dependent  \nloans. For commercial TDRs individually       \nevaluated for impairment, attributes of the   \nborrower are the primary factors in           \ndetermining the allowance for credit losses.  \nHowever, historical loss experience is also   \nincorporated into the allowance methodology   \napplied to this category of loans. Commercial \nlending segment TDR loans may be collectively \nevaluated for impairment where observed       \nperformance history, including defaults, is a \nprimary driver of the loss allocation. The    \nallowance recorded for TDR loans in the       \nconsumer lending segment is determined on a   \nhomogenous pool basis utilizing expected cash \nflows discounted using the original effective \ninterest rate of the pool. The expected cash  \nflows on TDR loans consider subsequent payment\ndefaults since modification, the borrower\u2019s   \nability to pay under the restructured terms,  \nand the timing and amount of payments. The    \nallowance for collateral-dependent loans in   \nthe consumer lending segment is determined    \nbased on the current fair value of the        \ncollateral less costs to sell. When evaluating\nthe appropriateness of the allowance for      \ncredit losses for any loans and lines in a    \njunior lien position, the Company considers   \nthe delinquency and modification status of the\nfirst lien. At September 30, 2020, the Company\nserviced the first lien on 39 percent of the  \nhome equity loans and lines in a junior lien  \nposition. The Company also considers the      \nstatus of first lien mortgage accounts        \nreported on customer credit bureau files when \nthe first lien is not serviced by the Company.\nRegardless of whether the Company services the\nfirst lien, an assessment is made of economic \nconditions, problem loans, recent loss        \nexperience and other factors in determining   \nthe allowance for credit losses. Based on the \navailable information, the Company estimated  \n$221 million or 1.7 percent of its total home \nequity portfolio at September 30, 2020,       \nrepresented non-delinquentjunior liens where  \nthe first lien was delinquent or modified,    \nexcluding loans in COVID-related forbearance  \nprograms. The Company considers historical    \nloss experience on the loans and lines in a   \njunior lien position to establish loss        \nestimates for junior lien loans and lines the \nCompany services that are current, but the    \nfirst lien is delinquent or modified.         \nHistorically, the number of junior lien       \ndefaults has been a small percentage of the   \ntotal portfolio (approximately 1 percent      \nannually), while the long-term average loss   \nrate on loans that default has been           \napproximately 80 percent. In addition, the    \nCompany obtains updated credit scores on its  \nhome equity portfolio each quarter, and in    \nsome cases more frequently, and uses this     \ninformation in its loss estimation methods. In\nits evaluation of the allowance for credit    \nlosses, the Company also considers the        \nincreased risk of loss associated with home   \nequity lines that are contractually scheduled \nto convert from a revolving status to a fully \namortizing payment. Beginning January 1, 2020,\nwhen a loan portfolio is purchased, the       \nacquired loans are divided into those         \nconsidered purchased with more than           \ninsignificant credit deterioration (\u201cPCD\u201d) and\nthose not considered purchased with more than \ninsignificant credit deterioration. An        \nallowance is established for each population  \nand considers product mix, risk               \ncharacteristics of the portfolio, bankruptcy  \nexperience, delinquency status, refreshed LTV \nratios when possible, and portfolio growth.   \nThe allowance established for purchased loans \nnot considered PCD is recognized through      \nprovision expense upon acquisition, whereas   \nthe allowance established for loans considered\nPCD at acquisition is offset by an increase in\nthe basis of the acquired loans. Any          \nsubsequent increases and decreases in the     \nallowance related to purchased loans are      \nrecognized through provision expense, with    \nfuture charge-offs charged to the allowance.  \nThe Company did not have a material amount of \nPCD loans included in its loan portfolio at   \nSeptember 30, 2020. The Company\u2019s methodology \nfor determining the appropriate allowance for \ncredit losses for each loan portfolio also    \nconsiders the imprecision inherent in the     \nmethodologies used. As a result, amounts      \ndetermined                                    \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    19  \n                      \nunder the methodologies described above are   \nadjusted by management to consider the        \npotential impact of other qualitative factors \nnot captured in quantitative model adjustments\nwhich include, but are not limited to, the    \nfollowing: model imprecision, imprecision in  \neconomic scenario assumptions, and emerging   \nrisks related to either changes in the        \neconomic environment that are affecting       \nspecific portfolios, or changes in portfolio  \nconcentrations over time that may affect model\nperformance. The consideration of these items \nresults in adjustments to allowance amounts   \nincluded in the Company\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses for each portfolio class. The results  \nof the analysis are evaluated quarterly to    \nconfirm the estimates are appropriate for each\nloan portfolio. Although the Company          \ndetermined the amount of each element of the  \nallowance separately and considers this       \nprocess to be an important credit management  \ntool, the entire allowance for credit losses  \nis available for the entire loan portfolio.   \nThe actual amount of losses can vary          \nsignificantly from the estimated amounts. At  \nSeptember 30, 2020, the allowance for credit  \nlosses was $8.0 billion (2.61 percent of      \nperiod-endloans), compared with an allowance  \nof $4.5 billion (1.52 percent of period-      \nendloans) at December 31, 2019. The ratio of  \nthe allowance for credit losses to            \nnonperforming loans was 678 percent at        \nSeptember 30, 2020, compared with 649 percent \nat December 31, 2019. The ratio of the        \nallowance for credit losses to annualized loan\nnet charge-offs was 391 percent at September  \n30, 2020, compared with 309 percent of full   \nyear 2019 net charge-offs at December 31,     \n2019. The increase in the allowance for credit\nlosses of $3.5 billion (78.4 percent) at      \nSeptember 30, 2020, compared with December 31,\n2019, reflected the $1.5 billion impact of the\nJanuary 1, 2020 adoption of new accounting    \nguidance, along with an additional $2.0       \nbillion increase during the first nine months \nof 2020 to recognize the expected losses      \nresulting from the deteriorating and ongoing  \neffects of adverse economic conditions driven \nby the impact of COVID-19on the domestic and  \nglobal economies, as well as new loan         \nproduction and acquired loans. Expected loss  \nestimates consider various factors including  \nthe changing economic activity, estimated     \nmitigating effects of government stimulus,    \nestimated duration and severity of the health \ncrisis, customer specific information         \nimpacting changes in risk ratings, projected  \ndelinquencies and the impact of industrywide  \nloan modification efforts designed to limit   \nlong-term effects of the COVID-19pandemic,    \namong other factors. Changes in economic      \nconditions as of September 30, 2020 included  \nsignificant reductions in economic activity   \nrelated to actions taken by governmental      \nauthorities to slow the spread of             \nCOVID-19.High levels of unemployment, and     \nlower gross domestic product estimates for    \n2020, as well as a slower pace of recovery in \nmanufacturing activity and oil prices, were   \nall observable changes in conditions that     \nincreased expected credit losses. At the same \ntime, record economic stimulus measures were  \nalso enacted, and additional measures are     \nbeing considered, with the intent to support  \nbusinesses and consumers through what is      \nexpected to be a period of reduced economic   \nactivity. To balance these offsetting factors,\neconomic scenarios updated through the end of \nthe third quarter of 2020 that produced higher\nquantitative loss estimates consistent with   \nthe expected deterioration in reported        \neconomic statistics were evaluated in         \nconjunction with management\u2019s expectation that\ncurrent and potential future stimulus efforts,\nas well as industrywide availability of short-\nterm payment deferral programs, would mitigate\nlosses estimated from models based on         \nhistorical data from periods when mitigation  \nefforts were not as extensive. Overall, loss  \nexpectations are consistent with prior        \neconomic downturn experience, but the severity\nof the deterioration in current economic      \nconditions is not expected to persist over the\nlife of the loan portfolio, as some indicators\nof economic activity have begun to improve    \ndirectionally. The allowance for credit losses\nrelated to commercial lending segment loans   \nincreased $1.4 billion during the nine months \nended September 30, 2020, as increased loan   \nvolume and credit downgrades during the period\nreflected the impact of COVID-19on certain    \nindustry sectors, including the retail and    \nrestaurants, energy, media and entertainment, \nlodging and airline industries that were      \nseverely impacted by virus containment        \nmeasures.

changes in the residual   \nvalue of leased vehicles, office and business \nequipment, and other assets through           \ndisciplined residual valuation setting at the \ninception of a lease, diversification of its  \nleased assets, regular residual asset         \nvaluation reviews and monitoring of residual  \nvalue gains or losses upon the disposition of \nassets. As of September 30, 2020, no          \nsignificant change in the amount of residual  \nvalues or concentration of the portfolios had \noccurred since December 31, 2019.

The Company        \nmaintains a system of controls with the       \nobjective of providing proper transaction     \nauthorization and execution, proper system    \noperations, proper oversight of third parties \nwith whom it does business, safeguarding of   \nassets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the \nreliability and security of financial and     \nother data.

The Company has controls and    \nprocesses in place for the assessment,        \nidentification, monitoring, management and    \nreporting of compliance risks and issues      \nincluding those created or increased by the   \neconomic and financial disruptions caused by  \nthe COVID-19pandemic. Refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s  \nDiscussion and Analysis \u2014 Compliance Risk     \nManagement\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on \nForm 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2019,\nfor further discussion on compliance risk     \nmanagement. Interest Rate Risk Management In  \nthe banking industry, changes in interest     \nrates are a significant risk that can impact  \nearnings and the safety and soundness of an   \nentity. The Company manages its exposure to   \nchanges in interest rates through asset and   \nliability management activities within        \nguidelines established by its Asset Liability \nManagement Committee (\u201cALCO\u201d) and approved by \nthe Board of Directors. The ALCO has the      \nresponsibility for approving and ensuring     \ncompliance with the ALCO management policies, \nincluding interest rate risk exposure. One way\nthe Company measures and analyzes its interest\nrate risk is through net interest income      \nsimulation analysis. Simulation analysis      \nincorporates substantially all of the         \nCompany\u2019s assets and liabilities and off-     \nbalancesheet instruments, together with       \nforecasted changes in the balance sheet and   \nassumptions that reflect the current interest \nrate environment. Through this simulation,    \nmanagement estimates the impact on net        \ninterest income of various interest rate      \nchanges that differ in the direction, amount  \nand speed of change over time, as well as the \nshape of the yield curve. This simulation     \nincludes assumptions about how the balance    \nsheet is likely to be affected by changes in  \nloan and deposit growth. Assumptions are made \nto project interest rates for new loans and   \ndeposits based on historical analysis,        \nmanagement\u2019s outlook and re-pricingstrategies.\nThese assumptions are reviewed and validated  \non a periodic basis with sensitivity analysis \nbeing provided for key variables of the       \nsimulation. The results are reviewed monthly  \nby the ALCO and are used to guide             \nasset/liability management strategies. The    \nCompany manages its interest rate risk        \nposition by holding assets with desired       \ninterest rate risk characteristics on its     \nbalance sheet, implementing certain pricing   \nstrategies for loans and deposits and         \nselecting derivatives and various funding and \ninvestment portfolio strategies. Table 9      \nsummarizes the projected impact to net        \ninterest income over the next 12 months of    \nvarious potential interest rate changes. The  \nsensitivity of the projected impact to net    \ninterest income over the next 12 months is    \ndependent on balance sheet growth, product    \nmix, deposit behavior, pricing and funding    \ndecisions. While the Company utilizes models  \nand assumptions based on historical           \ninformation and expected behaviors, actual    \noutcomes could vary significantly.            \n                      \n  22    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                              \n  Table\u00a09    Sensitivity of Net Interest      \n             Income                           \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  *  Given the level of interest rates,       \n     downward rate scenario is not computed.  \n                                              \nUse of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and\nOther Risks To manage the sensitivity of      \nearnings and capital to interest rate,        \nprepayment, credit, price and foreign currency\nfluctuations (asset and liability management  \npositions), the Company enters into derivative\ntransactions. The Company uses derivatives for\nasset and liability management purposes       \nprimarily in the following ways:              \n                                              \n       To convert fixed-rate debt from        \n  \u2022    fixed-rate payments to floating-rate   \n       payments;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       To convert the cash flows associated   \n  \u2022    with floating-rate debt from           \n       floating-rate payments to fixed-rate   \n       payments;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate changes in value of the    \n  \u2022    Company\u2019s unfunded mortgage loan       \n       commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs;    \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate remeasurement volatility   \n  \u2022    of foreign currency denominated        \n       balances; and                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       To mitigate the volatility of the      \n  \u2022    Company\u2019s net investment in foreign    \n       operations driven by fluctuations in   \n       foreign currency exchange rates.       \n                                              \nIn addition, the Company enters into interest \nrate and foreign exchange derivative contracts\nto support the business requirements of its   \ncustomers (customer-related positions). The   \nCompany minimizes the market and liquidity    \nrisks of customer-related positions by either \nentering into similar offsetting positions    \nwith broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis  \nby entering into other derivative or non-     \nderivativefinancial instruments that partially\nor fully offset the exposure from these       \ncustomer-related positions. The Company may   \nenter into derivative contracts that are      \neither exchange-traded, centrally cleared     \nthrough clearinghouses or over-the-counter.The\nCompany does not utilize derivatives for      \nspeculative purposes. The Company does not    \ndesignate all of the derivatives that it      \nenters into for risk management purposes as   \naccounting hedges because of the inefficiency \nof applying the accounting requirements and   \nmay instead elect fair value accounting for   \nthe related hedged items. In particular, the  \nCompany enters into interest rate swaps,      \nswaptions, forward commitments to buy to-be-  \nannouncedsecurities (\u201cTBAs\u201d), U.S. Treasury   \nand Eurodollar futures and options on U.S.    \nTreasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in  \nthe value of its MSRs, but does not designate \nthose derivatives as accounting hedges.       \nAdditionally, the Company uses forward        \ncommitments to sell TBAs and other commitments\nto sell residential mortgage loans at         \nspecified prices to economically hedge the    \ninterest rate risk in its residential mortgage\nloan production activities. At September 30,  \n2020, the Company had $14.9 billion of forward\ncommitments to sell, hedging $5.8 billion of  \nMLHFS and $13.3 billion of unfunded mortgage  \nloan commitments. The forward commitments to  \nsell and the unfunded mortgage loan           \ncommitments on loans intended to be sold are  \nconsidered derivatives under the accounting   \nguidance related to accounting for derivative \ninstruments and hedging activities. The       \nCompany has elected the fair value option for \nthe MLHFS. Derivatives are subject to credit  \nrisk associated with counterparties to the    \ncontracts. Credit risk associated with        \nderivatives is measured by the Company based  \non the probability of counterparty default,   \nincluding consideration of the                \nCOVID-19pandemic. The Company manages the     \ncredit risk of its derivative positions by    \ndiversifying its positions among various      \ncounterparties, by entering into master       \nnetting arrangements, and, where possible, by \nrequiring collateral arrangements. The Company\nmay also transfer counterparty credit risk    \nrelated to interest rate swaps to third       \nparties through the use of risk participation \nagreements. In addition, certain interest rate\nswaps, interest rate forwards and credit      \ncontracts are required to be centrally cleared\nthrough clearinghouses to further mitigate    \ncounterparty credit risk. For additional      \ninformation on derivatives and hedging        \nactivities, refer to Notes 12 and 13 in the   \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   \nLIBOR Transition In July 2017, the United     \nKingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority         \nannounced that it would no longer require     \nbanks to submit rates for the London InterBank\nOffered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) after 2021. The Company\nholds financial instruments that will be      \nimpacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR,      \nincluding certain loans, investment           \nsecurities, derivatives, borrowings and other \nfinancial instruments that use LIBOR as the   \nbenchmark rate. The Company also provides     \nvarious services to customers in its capacity \nas trustee, which involve financial           \ninstruments that will be similarly impacted by\nthe discontinuance of LIBOR. The Company      \nanticipates these financial instruments will  \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    23  \n                      \nrequire transition to a new reference rate.   \nThis transition will occur over time as many  \nof these arrangements do not have an          \nalternative rate referenced in their contracts\nor a clear path for the parties to agree upon \nan alternative reference rate. In order to    \nfacilitate the transition process, the Company\nhas instituted a LIBOR Transition Office and  \ncommenced an enterprise-wide project to       \nidentify, assess and monitor risks associated \nwith the expected discontinuance or           \nunavailability of LIBOR, actively engage with \nindustry working groups and regulators,       \nachieve operational readiness and engage      \nimpacted customers. It is currently unclear   \nwhat impact COVID-19may have on the LIBOR     \ntransition or on the timing thereof. Refer to \n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report \non Form 10-Kfor the year ended December 31,   \n2019, for further discussion on potential     \nrisks that could adversely affect the         \nCompany\u2019s financial results as a result of the\nLIBOR transition. Market Risk Management In   \naddition to interest rate risk, the Company is\nexposed to other forms of market risk,        \nprincipally related to trading activities     \nwhich support customers\u2019 strategies to manage \ntheir own foreign currency, interest rate risk\nand funding activities. For purposes of its   \ninternal capital adequacy assessment process, \nthe Company considers risk arising from its   \ntrading activities, as well as the            \nremeasurement volatility of foreign currency  \ndenominated balances included on its          \nConsolidated Balance Sheet (collectively,     \n\u201cCovered Positions\u201d), employing methodologies \nconsistent with the requirements of regulatory\nrules for market risk. The Company\u2019s Market   \nRisk Committee (\u201cMRC\u201d), within the framework  \nof the ALCO, oversees market risk management. \nThe MRC monitors and reviews the Company\u2019s    \nCovered Positions and establishes policies for\nmarket risk management, including exposure    \nlimits for each portfolio. The Company uses a \nVaR approach to measure general market risk.  \nTheoretically, VaR represents the statistical \nrisk of loss the Company has to adverse market\nmovements over a one-daytime horizon. The     \nCompany uses the Historical Simulation method \nto calculate VaR for its Covered Positions    \nmeasured at the ninety-ninth percentile using \na one-yearlook-back period for distributions  \nderived from past market data. The market     \nfactors used in the calculations include those\npertinent to market risks inherent in the     \nunderlying trading portfolios, principally    \nthose that affect the Company\u2019s corporate bond\ntrading business, foreign currency transaction\nbusiness, client derivatives business, loan   \ntrading business and municipal securities     \nbusiness, as well as those inherent in the    \nCompany\u2019s foreign denominated balances and the\nderivatives used to mitigate the related      \nmeasurement volatility. On average, the       \nCompany expects the one-dayVaR to be exceeded \nby actual losses two to three times per year  \nrelated to these positions. The Company       \nmonitors the accuracy of internal VaR models  \nand modeling processes by back-testing model  \nperformance, regularly updating the historical\ndata used by the VaR models and regular model \nvalidations to assess the accuracy of the     \nmodels\u2019 input, processing, and reporting      \ncomponents. All models are required to be     \nindependently reviewed and approved prior to  \nbeing placed in use. If the Company were to   \nexperience market losses in excess of the     \nestimated VaR more often than expected, the   \nVaR models and associated assumptions would be\nanalyzed and adjusted. The average, high, low \nand period-end one-dayVaR amounts for the     \nCompany\u2019s Covered Positions were as follows:  \n                                              \n  Nine Months Ended                           \n  September\u00a030                                \n  (Dollars in                                 \n  Millions)                  2020       2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Average                 $     2    $     1  \n  High                          3          2  \n  Low                           1          1  \n  Period-end                    2          1  \n                                              \nGiven the market volatility in the first      \nquarter of 2020 resulting from effects of the \nCOVID-19pandemic, the Company experienced     \nactual losses for its combined Covered        \nPositions that exceeded VaR five times during \nthe nine months ended September 30, 2020. The \nCompany did not experience any actual losses  \nfor its combined Covered Positions that       \nexceeded VaR during the nine months ended     \nSeptember 30, 2019.

The Company engages in various  \nactivities to manage its liquidity risk. These\nactivities include diversifying its funding   \nsources, stress testing, and holding readily- \nmarketable assets which can be used as a      \nsource of liquidity if needed. In addition,   \nthe Company\u2019s profitable operations, sound    \ncredit quality and strong capital position    \nhave enabled it to develop a large and        \nreliable base of core deposit funding within  \nits market areas and in domestic and global   \ncapital markets. During the nine months ended \nSeptember 30, 2020, the Company effectively   \nmanaged its liquidity position while funding  \nsignificant loan growth during the period. The\nCompany\u2019s Board of Directors approves the     \nCompany\u2019s liquidity policy. The Risk          \nManagement Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of\nDirectors oversees the Company\u2019s liquidity    \nrisk management process and approves a        \ncontingency funding plan. The ALCO reviews the\nCompany\u2019s liquidity policy and limits, and    \nregularly assesses the Company\u2019s ability to   \nmeet funding requirements arising from adverse\ncompany-specific or market events. The Company\nregularly projects its funding needs under    \nvarious stress scenarios and maintains a      \ncontingency funding plan consistent with the  \nCompany\u2019s access to diversified sources of    \ncontingent funding. The Company maintains a   \nsubstantial level of total available liquidity\nin the form of on-balancesheet and off-       \nbalancesheet funding sources. These liquidity \nsources include cash at the Federal Reserve   \nBank and certain European central banks,      \nunencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to   \nborrow from the FHLB and at Federal Reserve   \nBank\u2019s Discount Window. At September 30, 2020,\nthe fair value of unencumbered investment     \nsecurities totaled $123.6 billion, compared   \nwith $114.2 billion at December 31, 2019.     \nRefer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated  \nFinancial Statements and \u201cBalance Sheet       \nAnalysis\u201d for further information on          \ninvestment securities maturities and trends.  \nAsset liquidity is further enhanced by the    \nCompany\u2019s practice of pledging loans to access\nsecured borrowing facilities through the FHLB \nand Federal Reserve Bank. At September 30,    \n2020, the Company could have borrowed a total \nof an additional $97.0 billion from the FHLB  \nand Federal Reserve Bank based on collateral  \navailable for additional borrowings. The      \nCompany\u2019s diversified deposit base provides a \nsizeable source of relatively stable and low- \ncostfunding, while reducing the Company\u2019s     \nreliance on the wholesale markets. Total      \ndeposits were $413.2 billion at September 30, \n2020, compared with $361.9 billion at December\n31, 2019. Refer to \u201cBalance Sheet Analysis\u201d   \nfor further information on the Company\u2019s      \ndeposits. Additional funding is provided by   \nlong-term debt and short-term borrowings.     \nLong-term debt was $42.4 billion at September \n30, 2020, and is an important funding source  \nbecause of its multi-year borrowing structure.\nShort-term borrowings were $13.7 billion at   \nSeptember 30, 2020, and supplement the        \nCompany\u2019s other funding sources. Refer to     \n\u201cBalance Sheet Analysis\u201d for further          \ninformation on the Company\u2019s long-term debt   \nand short-term borrowings. In addition to     \nassessing liquidity risk on a consolidated    \nbasis, the Company monitors the parent        \ncompany\u2019s liquidity. The Company establishes  \nlimits for the minimal number of months into  \nthe future where the parent company can meet  \nexisting and forecasted obligations with cash \nand securities held that can be readily       \nmonetized. The Company measures and manages   \nthis limit in both normal and adverse         \nconditions.

The Company  \nmaintains sufficient liquidity to meet its    \ncapital and debt service obligations for 12   \nmonths under adverse conditions without the   \nsupport of dividends from subsidiaries or     \naccess to the wholesale markets. The parent   \ncompany is currently well in excess of        \nrequired liquidity minimums. At September 30, \n2020, parent company long-term debt           \noutstanding was $22.1 billion, compared with  \n$18.6 billion at December 31, 2019. The       \nincrease was primarily due to $2.8 billion of \nmedium-term note issuances. As of September   \n30, 2020, there was no parent company debt    \nscheduled to mature in the remainder of 2020. \nThe Company is subject to a regulatory        \nLiquidity Coverage Ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d) requirement  \nwhich requires banks to maintain an adequate  \nlevel of unencumbered high quality liquid     \nassets to meet estimated liquidity needs over \na 30-daystressed period. At September 30,     \n2020, the Company was compliant with this     \nrequirement.

Revenue       \ngenerated from sources in Europe represented  \napproximately 2 percent of the Company\u2019s total\nnet revenue for both the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2020. Operating cash for  \nthese businesses is deposited on a short-term \nbasis typically with certain European central \nbanks. For deposits placed at other European  \nbanks, exposure is mitigated by the Company   \nplacing deposits at multiple banks and        \nmanaging the amounts on deposit at any bank   \nbased on institution-specific deposit limits. \nAt September 30, 2020, the Company had an     \naggregate amount on deposit with European     \nbanks of approximately $9.2 billion,          \npredominately with the Central Bank of Ireland\nand Bank of England. In addition, the Company \nprovides financing to domestic multinational  \ncorporations that generate revenue from       \ncustomers in European countries, transacts    \nwith various European banks as counterparties \nto certain derivative-related activities, and \nthrough a subsidiary, manages money market    \nfunds that hold certain investments in        \nEuropean sovereign debt. Any further          \ndeterioration in economic conditions in       \nEurope, including the potential negative      \nimpact of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from\nthe European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d), is not expected\nto have a significant effect on the Company   \nrelated to these activities. The Company is   \nfocused on providing continuity of services,  \nwith minimal disruption resulting from Brexit,\nto customers with activities in European      \ncountries. The Company has made certain       \nstructural changes to its legal entities and  \noperations in the United Kingdom and European \nUnion, where needed, and migrated certain     \nbusiness activities to the appropriate        \njurisdictions to continue to provide such     \nservices and generate revenue. Off-           \nBalanceSheet Arrangements Off-balancesheet    \narrangements include any contractual          \narrangements to which an unconsolidated entity\nis a party, under which the Company has an    \nobligation to provide credit or liquidity     \nenhancements or market risk support. In the   \nordinary course of business, the Company      \nenters into an array of commitments to extend \ncredit, letters of credit and various forms of\nguarantees that may be considered off-        \nbalancesheet arrangements. Refer to Note 15 of\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nfor further information on these arrangements.\nThe Company does not utilize private label    \nasset securitizations as a source of funding. \nOff-balancesheet arrangements also include any\nobligation related to a variable interest held\nin an unconsolidated entity that provides     \nfinancing, liquidity, credit enhancement or   \nmarket risk support. Refer to Note 5 of the   \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements for\nfurther information related to the Company\u2019s  \ninterests in variable interest entities.      \nCapital Management The Company is committed to\nmanaging capital to maintain strong protection\nfor depositors and creditors and for maximum  \nshareholder benefit. The Company also manages \nits capital to exceed regulatory capital      \nrequirements for banking organizations. The   \nregulatory capital requirements effective for \nthe Company follow Basel III, with the Company\nbeing subject to calculating its capital      \nadequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted     \nassets under the standardized approach. During\n2020, the Company elected to adopt a rule     \nissued in March 2020 by its regulators which  \npermits banking organizations who adopt       \naccounting guidance related to the impairment \nof financial instruments based on the current \nexpected credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d) methodology   \nduring 2020, the option to defer the impact of\nthe effect of that guidance at adoption plus  \n25 percent of its quarterly credit reserve    \nincreases over the next two years on its      \nregulatory capital requirements, followed by a\nthree-year transition period                  \n                      \n  26    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \n                                         \n  Table\u00a010    Regulatory Capital Ratios  \n                                         \n                                              \n  (Dolla\u2026       Septemb\u2026          Decemb\u2026     \n  in                 30,              31,     \n  Millio\u2026           2020             2019     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Basel                                       \n  III                                         \n  standa\u2026                                     \n  approa\u2026                                     \n  Common                                      \n  equity     $    37,485       $   35,713     \n  tier 1                                      \n  capital                                     \n  Tier 1          43,916           41,721     \n  capital                                     \n  Total                                       \n  risk-b\u2026         52,086           49,744     \n  capital                                     \n  Risk-w\u2026        397,657          391,269     \n  assets                                      \n  Common                                      \n  equity                                      \n  tier 1                                      \n  capital                                     \n  as a               9.4  %           9.1  %  \n  percent                                     \n  of                                          \n  risk-w\u2026                                     \n  assets                                      \n  Tier 1                                      \n  capital                                     \n  as a                                        \n  percent           11.0             10.7     \n  of                                          \n  risk-w\u2026                                     \n  assets                                      \n  Total                                       \n  risk-b\u2026                                     \n  capital                                     \n  as a              13.1             12.7     \n  percent                                     \n  of                                          \n  risk-w\u2026                                     \n  assets                                      \n  Tier 1                                      \n  capital                                     \n  as a                                        \n  percent                                     \n  of                                          \n  adjust\u2026            8.3              8.8     \n  quarte\u2026                                     \n  average                                     \n  assets                                      \n  (lever\u2026                                     \n  ratio)                                      \n  Tier 1                                      \n  capital                                     \n  as a                                        \n  percent                                     \n  of                                          \n  totalo\u2026            7.2              7.0     \n  levera\u2026                                     \n  exposu\u2026                                     \n  (total                                      \n  levera\u2026                                     \n  exposu\u2026                                     \n  ratio)                                      \n                                              \nto phase in the cumulative deferred impact.   \nTable 10 provides a summary of statutory      \nregulatory capital ratios in effect for the   \nCompany at September 30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019. All regulatory ratios exceeded          \nregulatory \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d requirements.   \nThe Company believes certain other capital    \nratios are useful in evaluating its capital   \nadequacy. At September 30, 2020, the Company\u2019s\ntangible common equity, as a percent of       \ntangible assets and as a percent of risk-     \nweighted assets determined in accordance with \ntransitional regulatory capital requirements  \nrelated to the CECL methodology under the     \nstandardized approach, was 7.0 percent and 9.3\npercent, respectively. This compares to the   \nCompany\u2019s tangible common equity, as a percent\nof tangible assets and as a percent of risk-  \nweighted assets under the standardized        \napproach, of 7.5 percent and 9.3 percent,     \nrespectively, at December 31, 2019. In        \naddition, the Company\u2019s common equity tier 1  \ncapital to risk-weighted assets ratio,        \nreflecting the full implementation of the CECL\nmethodology was 9.0 percent at September 30,  \n2020. Refer to \u201cNon-GAAPFinancial Measures\u201d   \nbeginning on page 32 for further information  \non these other capital ratios. Total U.S.     \nBancorp shareholders\u2019 equity was $52.6 billion\nat September 30, 2020, compared with $51.9    \nbillion at December 31, 2019. The increase was\nprimarily the result of corporate earnings and\nchanges in unrealized gains and losses on     \navailable-for-saleinvestment securities       \nincluded in other comprehensive income (loss),\npartially offset by a reduction to retained   \nearnings due to the January 1, 2020 adoption  \nof accounting guidance related to the         \nimpairment of financial instruments, dividends\nand common share repurchases. Beginning in    \nMarch 2020, the Company suspended all common  \nstock repurchases except for those done       \nexclusively in connection with its stock-based\ncompensation programs. This action was        \ninitially taken by the Company to maintain    \nstrong capital levels given the impact and    \nuncertainties of COVID-19on the economy and   \nglobal markets. Due to continued economic     \nuncertainty, the Federal Reserve Board has    \nimplemented measures for the third and fourth \nquarters of 2020, prohibiting all large bank  \nholding companies, including the Company, from\nmaking common stock repurchases, as well as   \ncapping dividends at existing rates, which may\nnot be in excess of the average of the last   \nfour quarters\u2019 earnings. The Company will     \ncontinue to monitor the impact of COVID-19and \nwill adjust its capital distributions as      \ncircumstances warrant. Additional capital     \ndistributions are subject to the approval of  \nthe Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and will be \nconsistent with regulatory requirements.

During 2020, certain organization and   \nmethodology changes were made and,            \naccordingly, 2019 results were restated and   \npresented on a comparable basis.

Corporate and Commercial Banking     \ncontributed $421 million of the Company\u2019s net \nincome in the third quarter and $1.2 billion  \nin the first nine months of 2020, or an       \nincrease of $15 million (3.7 percent) and a   \ndecrease of $114 million (8.9 percent),       \nrespectively, compared with the same periods  \nof 2019. Net revenue increased $89 million    \n(9.1 percent) in the third quarter and $387   \nmillion (13.0 percent) in the first nine      \nmonths of 2020, compared with the same periods\nof 2019. Net interest income, on a taxable-   \nequivalent basis, increased $41 million (5.3  \npercent) in the third quarter and $180 million\n(7.8 percent) in the first nine months of     \n2020, compared with the same periods of 2019. \nThe increases were primarily due to strong    \nloan growth, and higher noninterest-bearing   \nand interest-bearing deposits, partially      \noffset by the impact on net interest margin of\nchanges in loan mix and lower spreads on      \nloans, reflecting changing interest rates     \ngiven the current economic environment.       \nNoninterest income increased $48 million (22.6\npercent) in the third quarter and $207 million\n(31.2 percent) in the first nine months of    \n2020, compared with the same periods of 2019, \nprimarily due to higher corporate bond        \nissuance fees and trading revenue as corporate\ncustomers accessed the fixed income capital   \nmarkets for bond issuances. Noninterest       \nexpense increased $18 million (4.5 percent) in\nthe third quarter and $50 million (4.1        \npercent) in the first nine months of 2020,    \ncompared with the same periods of 2019,       \nprimarily driven by higher compensation       \nexpense due to merit increases and variable   \ncompensation related to fixed income capital  \nmarkets business production, and higher FDIC  \ninsurance expense, partially offset by lower  \nnet shared services expense and lower other   \nnoninterest expense due to a reduction in     \ntravel as a result of COVID-19.The provision  \nfor credit losses increased $51 million in the\nthird quarter of 2020, compared with the third\nquarter of 2019, primarily due to higher net  \ncharge-offs, partially offset by a favorable  \nchange in the reserve allocation driven by    \npayoffs of funded exposures net of the impact \nof credit risk rating downgrades. The         \nprovision for credit losses increased $490    \nmillion in the first nine months of 2020,     \ncompared with the first nine months of 2019,  \nprimarily due to an unfavorable change in the \nreserve allocation based on economic risks    \nrelated to COVID-19in the portfolio, along    \nwith higher net charge-offs. Consumer and     \nBusiness Banking Consumer and Business Banking\ndelivers products and services through banking\noffices, telephone servicing and sales, on-   \nlineservices, direct mail, ATM processing and \nmobile devices.

months of 2020, compared with the same   \nperiods of 2019, mainly due to the impacts of \nCOVID-19on consumer and business spending     \nvolume in all payments businesses including   \nmerchant processing services, corporate       \npayment products, and credit and debit card   \nrevenue. The decrease in credit and debit card\nrevenue due to lower spending volume was      \noffset by higher prepaid card fees as a result\nof state unemployment programs. Noninterest   \nexpense increased $42 million (5.3 percent) in\nthe third quarter and $83 million (3.6        \npercent) in the first nine months of 2020,    \ncompared with the same periods of 2019,       \nreflecting incremental costs related to the   \nprepaid card business and higher software     \nexpense due to capital expenditures and       \nacquisitions, partially offset by lower       \nmarketing and business development expense due\nto the timing of marketing campaigns. The     \nprovision for credit losses decreased $14     \nmillion (5.4 percent) in the third quarter and\n$364 million (43.3 percent) in the first nine \nmonths of 2020, compared with the same periods\nof 2019, reflecting favorable changes in the  \nreserve allocation driven by lower outstanding\nloan balances and lower delinquency rates,    \npartially offset by the impact on the         \nallowance for credit losses to recognize the  \nexpected losses within the acquired State Farm\nBank credit card portfolio. The decrease in   \nthe provision for credit losses in the third  \nquarter of 2020, compared with the third      \nquarter of 2019, was also due to lower net    \ncharge-offs. Treasury and Corporate Support   \nTreasury and Corporate Support includes the   \nCompany\u2019s investment portfolios, funding,     \ncapital management, interest rate risk        \nmanagement, income taxes not allocated to the \nbusiness lines, including most investments in \ntax-advantagedprojects, and the residual      \naggregate of those expenses associated with   \ncorporate activities that are managed on a    \nconsolidated basis. Treasury and Corporate    \nSupport recorded net losses of $80 million in \nthe third quarter and $1.3 billion in the     \nfirst nine months of 2020, compared with net  \nincome of $220 million and $590 million,      \nrespectively, in the same periods of 2019. Net\nrevenue decreased $146 million (43.2 percent) \nin the third quarter and $347 million (35.8   \npercent) in the first nine months of 2020,    \ncompared with the same periods of 2019. Net   \ninterest income, on a taxable-equivalent      \nbasis, decreased $46 million in the third     \nquarter and $168 million in the first nine    \nmonths of 2020, compared with the same periods\nof 2019, primarily due to higher prepayment   \namortization and lower reinvestment yields    \nwithin the investment portfolio compared with \nthe prior year. Noninterest income decreased  \n$100 million (30.8 percent) in the third      \nquarter and $179 million (20.5 percent) in the\nfirst nine months of 2020, compared with the  \nsame periods of 2019, primarily due to lower  \nequity investment income, lower tax-          \nadvantagedinvestment syndication revenue and  \ncertain asset impairments as a result of      \nexpected branch closures. The decrease in     \nnoninterest income in the first nine months of\n2020, compared with the first nine months of  \n2019, was also due to asset impairments as a  \nresult of property damage from civil unrest in\nthe second quarter of 2020, partially offset  \nby gains on the sale of certain businesses in \nthe first quarter of 2020 and higher          \ninvestment securities gains. Noninterest      \nexpense increased $52 million (28.4 percent)  \nin the third quarter and $178 million (30.1   \npercent) in the first nine months of 2020,    \ncompared with the same periods of 2019,       \nprimarily due to the recognition of           \nliabilities related to airline exposure and   \nCOVID-related expenses, higher compensation   \nexpense reflecting merit increases and stock- \nbased compensation, and higher implementation \ncosts of capital investments to support       \nbusiness growth. These increases were         \npartially offset by lower net shared services \nexpense and lower costs related to tax-       \nadvantagedprojects. The provision for credit  \nlosses increased $216 million in the third    \nquarter and $2.0 billion in the first nine    \nmonths of 2020, compared with the same periods\nof 2019, reflecting the residual impact of    \nchanges in the allowance for credit losses    \nbeing impacted by adverse economic conditions \nand the expected impact to credit losses      \nwithin the Company\u2019s loan portfolios due to   \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Income taxes are       \nassessed to each line of business at a        \nmanagerial tax rate of 25.0 percent with the  \nresidual tax expense or benefit to arrive at  \nthe consolidated effective tax rate included  \nin Treasury and Corporate Support. NON-       \nGAAPFINANCIAL MEASURES In addition to capital \nratios defined by banking regulators, the     \nCompany considers various other measures when \nevaluating capital utilization and adequacy,  \nincluding:                                    \n                                              \n  \u2022    Tangible common equity to tangible     \n       assets,                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Tangible common equity to              \n       risk-weighted assets, and              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Common equity tier\u00a01 capital to        \n  \u2022    risk-weighted assets, reflecting the   \n       full implementation of the CECL        \n       methodology.                           \n                                              \nThese capital measures are viewed by          \nmanagement as useful additional methods of    \nevaluating the Company\u2019s utilization of its   \ncapital held and the level of capital         \navailable to withstand unexpected negative    \nmarket or economic conditions. Additionally,  \n                      \n  32    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \npresentation of these measures allows         \ninvestors, analysts and banking regulators to \nassess the Company\u2019s capital position relative\nto other financial services companies. These  \ncapital measures are not defined in generally \naccepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), or   \nare not currently effective or defined in     \nbanking regulations. In addition, certain of  \nthese measures differ from currently effective\ncapital ratios defined by banking regulations \nprincipally in that the currently effective   \nratios, which are subject to certain          \ntransitional provisions, temporarily exclude  \nthe impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting \nguidance related to impairment of financial   \ninstruments based on the CECL methodology. As \na result, these capital measures disclosed by \nthe Company may be considered non-            \nGAAPfinancial measures. Management believes   \nthis information helps investors assess trends\nin the Company\u2019s capital adequacy. The Company\nalso discloses net interest income and related\nratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent   \nbasis, which may also be considered non-      \nGAAPfinancial measures. The Company believes  \nthis presentation to be the preferred industry\nmeasurement of net interest income as it      \nprovides a relevant comparison of net interest\nincome arising from taxable and tax-          \nexemptsources. In addition, certain           \nperformance measures, including the efficiency\nratio and net interest margin utilize net     \ninterest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.\nThere may be limits in the usefulness of these\nmeasures to investors. As a result, the       \nCompany encourages readers to consider the    \nconsolidated financial statements and other   \nfinancial information contained in this report\nin their entirety, and not to rely on any     \nsingle financial measure.

\nand reporting policies of the Company comply  \nwith accounting principles generally accepted \nin the United States and conform to general   \npractices within the banking industry. The    \npreparation of financial statements in        \nconformity with GAAP requires management to   \nmake estimates and assumptions. The Company\u2019s \nfinancial position and results of operations  \ncan be affected by these estimates and        \nassumptions, which are integral to            \nunderstanding the Company\u2019s financial         \nstatements. Critical accounting policies are  \nthose policies management believes are the    \nmost important to the portrayal of the        \nCompany\u2019s financial condition and results, and\nrequire management to make estimates that are \ndifficult, subjective or complex. Most        \naccounting policies are not considered by     \nmanagement to be critical accounting policies.\nManagement has discussed the development and  \nthe selection of critical accounting policies \nwith the Company\u2019s Audit Committee. Those     \npolicies considered to be critical accounting \npolicies relate to the allowance for credit   \nlosses, fair value estimates, MSRs, and income\ntaxes. Allowance for Credit Losses            \nManagement\u2019s evaluation of the appropriate    \nallowance for credit losses is often the most \ncritical of all the accounting estimates for a\nbanking institution. It is an inherently      \nsubjective process impacted by many factors as\ndiscussed throughout the Management\u2019s         \nDiscussion and Analysis section of this       \nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The methods    \nutilized to estimate the allowance for credit \nlosses, key assumptions and quantitative and  \nqualitative information considered by         \nmanagement in determining the appropriate     \nallowance for credit losses at September 30,  \n2020 are discussed in the \u201cCredit Risk        \nManagement\u201d section. Although methodologies   \nutilized to determine each element of the     \nallowance reflect management\u2019s assessment of  \ncredit risk as identified through assessments \ncompleted of individual credits and of        \nhomogenous pools affected by material credit  \nevents, degrees of imprecision exist in these \nmeasurement tools due in part to subjective   \njudgments involved and an inherent lag in the \ndata available to quantify current conditions \nand events that affect credit loss reserve    \nestimates. As discussed in the \u201cAnalysis and  \nDetermination of Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d \nsection, management considered the effect of  \nchanges in economic conditions, risk          \nmanagement practices, and other factors that  \ncontributed to imprecision of loss estimates  \nin determining the allowance for credit       \nlosses. If not considered, expected losses in \nthe credit portfolio related to imprecision   \nand other subjective factors could have a     \ndramatic adverse impact on the liquidity and  \nfinancial viability of a banking institution. \nGiven the many quantitative variables and     \nsubjective factors affecting the credit       \nportfolio, changes in the allowance for credit\nlosses may not directly coincide with changes \nin the risk ratings of the credit portfolio   \nreflected in the risk rating process. This is \nin part due to the timing of the risk rating  \nprocess in relation to changes in the business\ncycle, the exposure and mix of loans within   \nrisk rating categories, levels of             \nnonperforming loans and the timing of charge- \noffs and expected recoveries. The allowance   \nfor credit losses on commercial lending       \nsegment loans measures the expected loss      \ncontent on the remaining portfolio exposure,  \nwhile nonperforming loans and net charge-offs \nare measures of specific impairment events    \nthat have already been confirmed. Therefore,  \nthe degree of change in the forward-looking   \nexpected loss in the commercial lending       \nallowance may differ from the level of changes\nin nonperforming loans and net charge-offs.   \nManagement maintains an appropriate allowance \nfor credit losses by updating allowance rates \nto reflect changes in expected losses,        \nincluding expected changes in economic or     \nbusiness cycle conditions. Some factors       \nconsidered in determining the appropriate     \nallowance for credit losses are more readily  \nquantifiable while other factors require      \nextensive qualitative judgment. Management    \nconducts an analysis with respect to the      \naccuracy of risk ratings and the volatility of\nexpected losses, and utilizes this analysis   \nalong with qualitative factors that can affect\nthe precision of credit loss estimates,       \nincluding economic conditions, such as changes\nin gross domestic product, unemployment or    \nbankruptcy rates, and concentration risks,    \nsuch as risks associated with specific        \nindustries, collateral valuations, and loans  \nto highly leveraged enterprises, in           \ndetermining the overall level of the allowance\nfor credit losses. The Company considers a    \nrange of economic scenarios in its            \ndetermination of the allowance for credit     \nlosses. These scenarios are constructed with  \ninterrelated projections of multiple economic \nvariables, and loss estimates are produced    \nthat consider the historical correlation of   \nthose economic variables with credit losses,  \nand also the expectation that conditions will \neventually normalize over the longer run.     \nScenarios worse than the Company\u2019s expected   \noutcome at September 30, 2020 include risks   \nthat government stimulus in response to the   \nCOVID-19pandemic is less broad or less        \neffective than expected, or that a longer or  \nmore severe health crisis prolongs the        \ndownturn in economic activity, reducing the   \nnumber of businesses that are ultimately able \nto resume operations after the crisis has     \npassed.                                       \n                      \n  34    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nThe Company\u2019s determination of the allowance  \nfor commercial lending segment loans is       \nsensitive to the assigned credit risk ratings \nand expected loss rates at September 30, 2020.\nIf 20 percent of period ending loan balances  \n(including unfunded commitments) within each  \nrisk category of risk rated commercial lending\nloans experienced a downgrade to the next     \nworse risk category, the allowance for credit \nlosses would have increased by approximately  \n$219 million at September 30, 2020. If        \nquantitative loss estimates for commercial    \nlending segment loans increased by 10 percent,\nthe allowance for credit losses would have    \nincreased by approximately $343 million at    \nSeptember 30, 2020. The Company believes the  \nallowance for credit losses appropriately     \nconsiders the imprecision in estimating credit\nlosses based on credit risk ratings and credit\nloss model estimates, but actual losses may   \ndiffer from those estimates. The Company\u2019s    \ndetermination of the allowance for consumer   \nlending segment loans is sensitive to changes \nin estimated loss rates and estimated         \nimpairments on restructured loans. In the     \nevent that estimated losses for this segment  \nof the loan portfolio increased by 10 percent,\nthe allowance for credit losses would have    \nincreased by approximately $313 million at    \nSeptember 30, 2020. Because several           \nquantitative and qualitative factors are      \nconsidered in determining the allowance for   \ncredit losses, these sensitivity analyses do  \nnot necessarily reflect the nature and extent \nof future changes in the allowance for credit \nlosses. They are intended to provide insights \ninto the impact of adverse changes in risk    \nrating and loss model estimates and do not    \nimply any expectation of future deterioration \nin the risk rating or loss rates. Given       \ncurrent processes employed by the Company,    \nmanagement believes the risk ratings and loss \nmodel estimates currently assigned are        \nappropriate. It is possible that others, given\nthe same information, may at any point in time\nreach different reasonable conclusions that   \ncould be significant to the Company\u2019s         \nfinancial statements.

Based upon this evaluation, \nthe principal executive officer and principal \nfinancial officer have concluded that, as of  \nthe end of the period covered by this report, \nthe Company\u2019s disclosure controls and         \nprocedures were effective. During the most    \nrecently completed fiscal quarter, there was  \nno change made in the Company\u2019s internal      \ncontrol over financial reporting (as defined  \nin Rules 13a-15(f)and 15d-15(f)under the      \nExchange Act) that has materially affected, or\nis reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial     \nreporting.

information and \nnotes necessary for a complete presentation of\nfinancial position, results of operations and \ncash flow activity required in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in   \nthe United States. In the opinion of          \nmanagement of U.S.\u00a0Bancorp (the \u201cCompany\u201d),   \nall adjustments (consisting only of normal    \nrecurring adjustments) necessary for a fair   \nstatement of results for the interim periods  \nhave been made. These financial statements and\nnotes should be read in conjunction with the  \nconsolidated financial statements and notes   \nincluded in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on    \nForm 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031,     \n2019. Certain amounts in prior periods have   \nbeen reclassified to conform to the current   \npresentation.                                 \n                                \n  Note\u00a02    Accounting Changes  \n                                \nFinancial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses Effective \nJanuary 1, 2020, the Company adopted          \naccounting guidance, issued by the Financial  \nAccounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) in June   \n2016, related to the impairment of financial  \ninstruments. This guidance changes impairment \nrecognition to a model that is based on       \nexpected losses rather than incurred losses,  \nwhich is intended to result in more timely    \nrecognition of credit losses. This guidance is\nalso intended to reduce the complexity of     \naccounting guidance by decreasing the number  \nof credit impairment models that entities use \nto account for debt instruments. In addition, \nthe guidance requires additional credit       \nquality disclosures for loans. Upon adoption, \nthe Company increased its allowance for credit\nlosses by approximately $ 1.5billion and      \nreduced retained earnings net of deferred tax \nbalances by approximately $ 1.1billion through\na cumulative-effect adjustment. The increase  \nin the allowance at adoption was primarily    \nrelated to the commercial, credit card,       \ninstallment and other retail loan portfolios  \nwhere the allowance for loan losses had not   \npreviously considered the full term of the    \nloans. The Company has elected to defer the   \nimpact of the effect of the guidance at       \nadoption plus 25 percent of its quarterly     \ncredit reserve increases over the next two    \nyears on its regulatory capital requirements, \nfollowed by a transition period to phase in   \nthe cumulative deferred impact at 25 percent  \nper year from 2022 to 2025, as provided by    \nrules issued by its regulators.               \nThe adoption of this guidance did not have a  \nmaterial impact on the Company\u2019s available-   \nfor-sale securities as most of this portfolio \nconsists of U.S. Treasury and residential     \nagency mortgage-backed securities that        \ninherently have an immaterial risk of loss.   \n Reference Interest Rate Transition In March  \n  2020, the FASB issued accounting guidance,  \n providing temporary optional expedients and  \n exceptions to the guidance in United States  \n generally accepted accounting principles on  \n contract modifications and hedge accounting, \n   to ease the financial reporting burdens    \nrelated to the expected market transition from\n the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d)  \n     and other interbank offered rates to     \n    alternative reference rates. Under the    \n  guidance, a company can elect not to apply  \n certain modification accounting requirements \n to contracts affected by the reference rate  \n  transition, if certain criteria are met. A  \ncompany that makes this election would not be \n  required to remeasure the contracts at the  \n   modification date or reassess a previous   \n accounting determination. This guidance also \n permits a company to elect various optional  \n  expedients that would allow it to continue  \n    applying hedge accounting for hedging     \n   relationships affected by reference rate   \n transition, if certain criteria are met.

If the Company    \nintends to sell or it is more likely than not \nthe Company will be required to sell an       \ninvestment security, the amortized cost of the\nsecurity is written down to fair value. When  \nevaluating credit losses, the Company         \nconsiders various factors such as the nature  \nof the investment security, the credit ratings\nor financial condition of the issuer, the     \nextent of the unrealized loss, expected cash  \nflows of underlying collateral, the existence \nof any government or agency guarantees, and   \nmarket conditions. The Company measures the   \nallowance for credit losses using market      \ninformation where available and discounting   \nthe cash flows at the original effective rate \nof the investment security. The allowance for \ncredit losses is adjusted each period through \nearnings and can be subsequently recovered.   \nThe allowance for credit losses on the        \nCompany\u2019s available-for-sale investment       \nsecurities was immaterial at September 30,    \n2020.                                         \n                      \n  42    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nAt September 30, 2020, certain investment     \nsecurities had a fair value below amortized   \ncost.

U.S. Treasury and agencies        \nsecurities and agency mortgage-backed         \nsecurities are issued, guaranteed or otherwise\nsupported by the United States government. The\nCompany\u2019s obligations of state and political  \nsubdivisions are generally high grade.        \nAccordingly, the Company does not consider    \nthese unrealized losses to be credit-related  \nand an allowance for credit losses is not     \nnecessary. In general, the issuers of the     \ninvestment securities are contractually       \nprohibited from prepayment at less than par,  \nand the Company did not pay significant       \npurchase premiums for these investment        \nsecurities. At September 30, 2020, the Company\nhad no plans to sell investment securities    \nwith unrealized losses, and believes it is    \nmore likely than not it would not be required \nto sell such

Net unearned interest   \nand deferred fees and costs amounted to $ 848 \nmillion at September\u00a030, 2020 and $ 781       \nmillion at December\u00a031, 2019. All purchased   \nloans are recorded at fair value at the date  \nof purchase. Beginning January\u00a01, 2020, the   \nCompany evaluates purchased loans for more-   \nthan-insignificant deterioration at the date  \nof purchase in accordance with applicable     \nauthoritative accounting guidance. Purchased  \nloans that have experienced more-than-        \ninsignificant deterioration from origination  \nare considered purchased credit deteriorated  \n(\u201cPCD\u201d) loans. All other purchased loans are  \nconsidered non-purchased credit deteriorated  \nloans.                                        \nThe Company offers a broad array of lending   \nproducts and categorizes its loan portfolio   \ninto two segments, which is the level at which\nit develops and documents a systematic        \nmethodology to determine the allowance for    \ncredit losses. The Company\u2019s two loan         \nportfolio segments are commercial lending and \nconsumer lending.                             \nAllowance for Credit Losses Beginning January \n1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses is   \nestablished for current expected credit losses\non the Company\u2019s loan and lease portfolio,    \nincluding unfunded credit commitments. The    \nallowance for credit losses is increased      \nthrough provisions charged to earnings and    \nreduced by net charge-offs. Management        \nevaluates the appropriateness of the allowance\nfor credit losses on a quarterly basis. The   \nallowance considers expected losses for the   \nremaining lives of the applicable assets,     \ninclusive of expected recoveries. Remaining   \nlives of the applicable assets are adjusted   \nfor prepayments. Multiple economic scenarios  \nare considered over a three-year reasonable   \nand supportable forecast period, which        \nincorporates historical loss experience in    \nyears two and three. These economic scenarios \nare constructed with interrelated projections \nof multiple economic variables, and loss      \nestimates are produced that consider the      \nhistorical correlation of those economic      \nvariables with credit losses. After the       \nforecast period, the Company fully reverts to \nlong-term historical loss experience, adjusted\nfor prepayments and characteristics of the    \ncurrent loan and lease portfolio, to estimate \nlosses over the remaining lives. The economic \nscenarios are updated at least quarterly and  \nare designed to provide a range of reasonable \nestimates, both better and worse than current \nexpectations. Scenarios are weighted based on \nthe Company\u2019s expectation of future           \nconditions. Final loss estimates also consider\nfactors affecting credit losses not reflected \nin the scenarios, due to the unique aspects of\ncurrent conditions and expectations. These    \nfactors may include, but are not limited to,  \nloan servicing practices, regulatory guidance,\nand/or fiscal and monetary policy actions.    \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    45  \n                      \nThe allowance recorded for credit losses      \nutilizes forward-looking expected loss models \nto consider a variety of factors affecting    \nlifetime credit losses. These factors include,\nbut are not limited to, macroeconomic         \nvariables such as unemployment rate, real     \nestate prices, gross domestic product levels, \ncorporate bonds spreads and long-term interest\nrate forecasts, as well as loan and borrower  \ncharacteristics, such as internal risk ratings\non commercial loans and consumer credit       \nscores, delinquency status, collateral type   \nand available valuation information,          \nconsideration of end-of-termlosses on lease   \nresiduals, and the remaining term of the loan,\nadjusted for expected prepayments. Where loans\ndo not exhibit similar risk characteristics,  \nan individual analysis is performed to        \nconsider expected credit losses. For each loan\nportfolio, model estimates are adjusted as    \nnecessary to consider any relevant changes in \nportfolio composition, lending policies,      \nunderwriting standards, risk management       \npractices, economic conditions or other       \nfactors that would affect the accuracy of the \nmodel. Expected credit loss estimates also    \ninclude consideration of expected cash        \nrecoveries on loans previously charged-off,or \nexpected recoveries on collateral dependent   \nloans where recovery is expected through sale \nof the collateral. The allowance recorded for \nindividually evaluated loans greater than $5  \nmillion in the commercial lending segment is  \nbased on an analysis utilizing expected cash  \nflows discounted using the original effective \ninterest rate, the observable market price of \nthe loan, or the fair value of the collateral,\nless selling costs, for collateral-dependent  \nloans. The allowance recorded for Troubled    \nDebt Restructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d) loans in the       \nconsumer lending segment is determined on a   \nhomogenous pool basis utilizing expected cash \nflows discounted using the original effective \ninterest rate of the pool. TDRs do not include\nloan modifications granted to customers       \nresulting directly from the economic effects  \nof the COVID-19pandemic. The expected cash    \nflows on TDR loans consider subsequent payment\ndefaults since modification, the borrower\u2019s   \nability to pay under the restructured terms,  \nand the timing and amount of payments. The    \nallowance for collateral-dependent loans in   \nthe consumer lending segment is determined    \nbased on the fair value of the collateral less\ncosts to sell. With respect to the commercial \nlending segment, TDRs may be collectively     \nevaluated for impairment where observed       \nperformance history, including defaults, is a \nprimary driver of the loss allocation. For    \ncommercial TDRs individually evaluated for    \nimpairment, attributes of the borrower are the\nprimary factors in determining the allowance  \nfor credit losses. However, historical loss   \nexperience is also incorporated into the      \nallowance methodology applied to this category\nof loans. Beginning January 1, 2020, when a   \nloan portfolio is purchased, an allowance is  \nestablished for those loans considered        \npurchased with more-than-insignificant credit \ndeterioration, or PCD loans, and those not    \nconsidered purchased with more-than-          \ninsignificant credit deterioration. The       \nallowance established for each population     \nconsiders product mix, risk characteristics of\nthe portfolio, bankruptcy experience,         \ndelinquency status, refreshed loan-to-        \nvalueratios when possible, and portfolio      \ngrowth. The allowance established for         \npurchased loans not considered PCD is         \nrecognized through provision expense upon     \nacquisition, whereas the allowance established\nfor loans considered PCD at acquisition is    \noffset by an increase in the basis of the     \nacquired loans. Any subsequent increases and  \ndecreases in the allowance related to         \npurchased loans are recognized through        \nprovision expense, with future charge-offs    \ncharged to the allowance. The Company did not \nhave a material amount of PCD loans included  \nin its loan portfolio at September 30, 2020.  \nThe Company\u2019s methodology for determining the \nappropriate allowance for credit losses for   \neach loan portfolio also considers the        \nimprecision inherent in the methodologies     \nused. As a result, amounts determined under   \nthe methodologies described above are adjusted\nby management to consider the potential impact\nof other qualitative factors not captured in  \nquantitative model adjustments which include, \nbut are not limited to, the following: model  \nimprecision, imprecision in economic scenario \nassumptions, and emerging risks related to    \neither changes in the environment that are    \naffecting specific portfolios, or changes in  \nportfolio concentrations over time that may   \naffect model performance. The consideration of\nthese items results in adjustments to         \nallowance amounts included in the Company\u2019s   \nallowance for credit losses specific to each  \nportfolio class. The Company also assesses the\ncredit risk associated with off-balancesheet  \nloan commitments, letters of credit,          \ninvestment securities and derivatives. Credit \nrisk associated with derivatives is reflected \nin the fair values recorded for those         \npositions. The liability for off-balancesheet \ncredit exposure related to loan commitments   \nand other credit guarantees is included in    \nother liabilities. Because business processes \nand credit risks associated with unfunded     \ncredit commitments are essentially the same as\nfor loans, the Company utilizes similar       \nprocesses to estimate its liability for       \nunfunded credit commitments. The results of   \nthe analysis are evaluated quarterly to       \nconfirm the estimates are appropriate for each\nloan portfolio.                               \n                      \n  46    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nActivity in the allowance for credit losses by\nportfolio class was as follows:               \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Effective January\u00a01, 2020, the         \n       Company adopted accounting guidance    \n       which changed impairment recognition   \n       of financial instruments to a model    \n       that is based on expected losses\u00a0      \n  (a)  rather than incurred losses.           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nThe increase in the allowance for credit      \nlosses from December\u00a031, 2019 to September\u00a030,\n2020 reflected the deteriorating and ongoing  \neffects of adverse economic conditions driven \nby the impact of COVID-19 on the domestic and \nglobal economies. Expected loss estimates     \nconsider both the changes in economic         \nactivity, and the mitigating effects of       \ngovernment stimulus and industrywide loan     \nmodification efforts designed to limit long   \nterm effects of the pandemic.                 \n                                              \nCredit Quality The credit quality of the      \nCompany\u2019s loan portfolios is assessed as a    \nfunction of net credit losses, levels of      \nnonperforming assets and delinquencies, and   \ncredit quality ratings as defined by the      \nCompany.                                      \n                                              \nFor all loan classes, loans are considered    \npast due based on the number of days          \ndelinquent except for monthly amortizing loans\nwhich are classified delinquent based upon the\nnumber of contractually required payments not \nmade (for example, two missed payments is     \nconsidered 30 days delinquent). When a loan is\nplaced on nonaccrual status, unpaid accrued   \ninterest is reversed, reducing interest income\nin the current period.                        \n                                              \nCommercial lending segment loans are generally\nplaced on nonaccrual status when the          \ncollection of principal and interest has      \nbecome 90 days past due or is otherwise       \nconsidered doubtful. Commercial lending       \nsegment loans are generally fully or partially\ncharged down to the fair value of the         \ncollateral securing the loan, less costs to   \nsell, when the loan is placed on nonaccrual.  \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    47  \n                      \nConsumer lending segment loans are generally  \ncharged-off at a specific number of days or   \npayments past due. Residential mortgages and  \nother retail loans secured by 1-4 family      \nproperties are generally charged down to the  \nfair value of the collateral securing the     \nloan, less costs to sell, at 180 days past    \ndue. Residential mortgage loans and lines in a\nfirst lien position are placed on nonaccrual  \nstatus in instances where a partial charge-off\noccurs unless the loan is well secured and in \nthe process of collection. Residential        \nmortgage loans and lines in a junior lien     \nposition secured by 1-4 family properties are \nplaced on nonaccrual status at 120\u00a0days past  \ndue or when they are behind a first lien that \nhas become 180 days or greater past due or    \nplaced on nonaccrual status. Any secured      \nconsumer lending segment loan whose borrower  \nhas had debt discharged through bankruptcy,   \nfor which the loan amount exceeds the fair    \nvalue of the collateral, is charged down to   \nthe fair value of the related collateral and  \nthe remaining balance is placed on nonaccrual \nstatus. Credit card loans continue to accrue  \ninterest until the account is charged-off.    \nCredit cards are charged-off at 180 days past \ndue. Other retail loans not secured by 1-4    \nfamily properties are charged-off at 120\u00a0days \npast due; and revolving consumer lines are    \ncharged-off at 180 days past due. Similar to  \ncredit cards, other retail loans are generally\nnot placed on nonaccrual status because of the\nrelative short period of time to charge-off.  \nCertain retail customers having financial     \ndifficulties may have the terms of their      \ncredit card and other loan agreements modified\nto require only principal payments and, as    \nsuch, are reported as nonaccrual.             \n                                              \nFor all loan classes, interest payments       \nreceived on nonaccrual loans are generally    \nrecorded as a reduction to a loan\u2019s carrying  \namount while a loan is on nonaccrual and are  \nrecognized as interest income upon payoff of  \nthe loan. However, interest income may be     \nrecognized for interest payments if the       \nremaining carrying amount of the loan is      \nbelieved to be collectible. In certain        \ncircumstances, loans in any class may be      \nrestored to accrual status, such as when a    \nloan has demonstrated sustained repayment     \nperformance or no amounts are past due and    \nprospects for future payment are no longer in \ndoubt; or when the loan becomes well secured  \nand is in the process of collection. Loans    \nwhere there has been a partial charge-off may \nbe returned to accrual status if all principal\nand interest (including amounts previously    \ncharged-off) is expected to be collected and  \nthe loan is current. Generally, purchased     \ncredit deteriorated loans are considered      \naccruing loans. However, the timing and amount\nof future cash flows for some loans is not    \nreasonably estimable, and those loans are     \nclassified as nonaccrual loans with interest  \nincome not recognized until the timing and    \namount of the future cash flows can be        \nreasonably estimated.                         \nThe following table provides a summary of     \nloans by portfolio class, including the       \ndelinquency status of those that continue to  \naccrue interest, and those that are           \nnonperforming:                                \n                                              \n                         90                   \n                         D\u2026                   \n                         or                   \n                         M\u2026                   \n         \u2026       \u2026       P\u2026       \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026       D\u2026       \u2026       T\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  68    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026        1       \u2026       4\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       7\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2013       2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       79       \u2026       5\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  4\u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  79    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026        3       \u2026       3\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       7\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2013       2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       97       \u2026       5\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  6\u2026    $  \u2026    $  2\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n       At September\u00a030, 2020, $1.3billion of  \n       loans 30\u201389 days past due and          \n       $1.6billion of loans 90 days or more   \n       past due purchased from Government     \n       National Mortgage Association          \n       (\u201cGNMA\u201d) mortgage pools whose          \n  (a)  repayments are insured by the Federal  \n       Housing Administration or guaranteed   \n       by the United States Department of     \n       Veterans Affairs, were classified as   \n       current, compared with $428million     \n       and $1.7billion at December\u00a031, 2019,  \n       respectively.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Substantially all nonperforming loans  \n       at September\u00a030, 2020 and December\u00a0    \n       31, 2019, had an associated allowance  \n       for credit losses.

The Company recognizes interest on  \nTDRs if the borrower complies with the revised\nterms and conditions as agreed upon with the  \nCompany and has demonstrated repayment        \nperformance at a level commensurate with the  \nmodified terms over several payment cycles,   \nwhich is generally six months or greater.

The post-       \nmodification balances for these loans reflect \nthe current outstanding balance until a       \npermanent modification is made. In addition,  \nthe post-modification balances typically      \ninclude capitalization of unpaid accrued      \ninterest and/or fees under the various        \nmodification programs.For those loans modified\nas TDRs during the third quarter of 2020, at  \nSeptember 30, 2020, 15residential mortgages,  \n4home equity and second mortgage loans and    \n238loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools   \nwith outstanding balances of $ 4million, less \nthan $ 1million and $ 36million, respectively,\nwere in a trial period and have estimated     \npost-modification balances of $ 4million, less\nthan $ 1million and $ 36million, respectively,\nassuming permanent modification occurs at the \nend of the trial period.                      \n                                              \nThe Company has implemented certain           \nrestructuring programs that may result in     \nTDRs. However, many of the Company\u2019s TDRs are \nalso determined on a case-by-case basis in    \nconnection with ongoing loan collection       \nprocesses.                                    \n                                              \nFor the commercial lending segment,           \nmodifications generally result in the Company \nworking with borrowers on a case-by-case      \nbasis. Commercial and commercial real estate  \nmodifications generally include extensions of \nthe maturity date and may be accompanied by an\nincrease or decrease to the interest rate,    \nwhich may not be deemed a market interest     \nrate. In addition, the Company may work with  \nthe borrower in identifying other changes that\nmitigate loss to the Company, which may       \ninclude additional collateral or guarantees to\nsupport the loan. To a lesser extent, the     \nCompany may waive contractual principal. The  \nCompany classifies all of the above           \nconcessions as TDRs to the extent the Company \ndetermines that the borrower is experiencing  \nfinancial difficulty.                         \n                                              \nModifications for the consumer lending segment\nare generally part of programs the Company has\ninitiated. The Company modifies residential   \nmortgage loans under Federal Housing          \nAdministration, United States Department of   \nVeterans Affairs, or its own internal         \nprograms. Under these programs, the Company   \noffers qualifying homeowners the opportunity  \nto permanently modify their loan and achieve  \nmore affordable monthly payments by providing \nloan concessions. These concessions may       \ninclude adjustments to interest rates,        \nconversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates,\n                      \n  50    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nextension of maturity dates or deferrals of   \npayments, capitalization of accrued interest  \nand/or outstanding advances, or in limited    \nsituations, partial forgiveness of loan       \nprincipal. In most instances, participation in\nresidential mortgage loan restructuring       \nprograms requires the customer to complete a  \nshort-term trial period. A permanent loan     \nmodification is contingent on the customer    \nsuccessfully completing the trial period      \narrangement, and the loan documents are not   \nmodified until that time. The Company reports \nloans in a trial period arrangement as TDRs   \nand continues to report them as TDRs after the\ntrial period.                                 \n                                              \nCredit card and other retail loan TDRs are    \ngenerally part of distinct restructuring      \nprograms providing customers experiencing     \nfinancial difficulty with modifications       \nwhereby balances may be amortized up to 60    \nmonths, and generally include waiver of fees  \nand reduced interest rates.                   \n                                              \nIn addition, the Company considers secured    \nloans to consumer borrowers that have debt    \ndischarged through bankruptcy where the       \nborrower has not reaffirmed the debt to be    \nTDRs.                                         \n                                              \nLoan modifications or concessions granted to  \nborrowers resulting directly from the effects \nof the COVID-19pandemic, who were otherwise in\ncurrent payment status, are not considered to \nbe TDRs.

These    \nloans had aggregate outstanding balances of $ \n19million and $ 53million for the three months\nand nine months ended September 30, 2020,     \nrespectively.                                 \n                                              \nAs of September 30, 2020, the Company had $   \n156million of commitments to lend additional  \nfunds to borrowers whose terms of their       \noutstanding owed balances have been modified  \nin TDRs.                                      \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    51  \n                      \n                                              \n            Accounting\u00a0for\u00a0Transfers\u00a0and\u00a0     \n  Note\u00a05    Servicing\u00a0of\u00a0Financial\u00a0Assets\u00a0    \n            and\u00a0Variable\u00a0Interest\u00a0Entities    \n                                              \nThe Company transfers financial assets in the \nnormal course of business. The majority of the\nCompany\u2019s financial asset transfers are       \nresidential mortgage loan sales primarily to  \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d),    \ntransfers of tax-advantaged investments,      \ncommercial loan sales through participation   \nagreements, and other individual or portfolio \nloan and securities sales. In accordance with \nthe accounting guidance for asset transfers,  \nthe Company considers any ongoing involvement \nwith transferred assets in determining whether\nthe assets can be derecognized from the       \nbalance sheet . Guarantees provided to certain\nthird parties in connection with the transfer \nof assets are further discussed in Note\u00a015.   \nFor loans sold under participation agreements,\nthe Company also considers whether the terms  \nof the loan participation agreement meet the  \naccounting definition of a participating      \ninterest. With the exception of servicing and \ncertain performance-based guarantees, the     \nCompany\u2019s continuing involvement with         \nfinancial assets sold is minimal and generally\nlimited to market customary representation and\nwarranty clauses. Any gain or loss on sale    \ndepends on the previous carrying amount of the\ntransferred financial assets, the             \nconsideration received, and any liabilities   \nincurred in exchange for the transferred      \nassets. Upon transfer, any servicing assets   \nand other interests that continue to be held  \nby the Company are initially recognized at    \nfair value. For further information on        \nmortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d), refer to  \nNote 6. On a limited basis, the Company may   \nacquire and package high-grade corporate bonds\nfor select corporate customers, in which the  \nCompany generally has no continuing           \ninvolvement with these transactions.          \nAdditionally, the Company is an authorized    \nGNMA issuer and issues GNMA securities on a   \nregular basis. The Company has no other asset \nsecuritizations or similar asset-backed       \nfinancing arrangements that are off-balance   \nsheet.                                        \nThe Company also provides financial support   \nprimarily through the use of waivers of trust \nand investment management fees associated with\nvarious unconsolidated registered money market\nfunds it manages. The Company provided $      \n28million and $ 8million of support to the    \nfunds during the three months ended September \n30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $        \n49million and $ 22million during the nine     \nmonths ended September 30, 2020 and 2019,     \nrespectively.                                 \nThe Company is involved in various entities   \nthat are considered to be variable interest   \nentities (\u201cVIEs\u201d). The Company\u2019s investments  \nin VIEs are primarily related to investments  \npromoting affordable housing, community       \ndevelopment and renewable energy sources. Some\nof these tax-advantaged investments support   \nthe Company\u2019s regulatory compliance with the  \nCommunity Reinvestment Act. The Company\u2019s     \ninvestments in these entities generate a      \nreturn primarily through the realization of   \nfederal and state income tax credits, and     \nother tax benefits, such as tax deductions    \nfrom operating losses of the investments, over\nspecified time periods. These tax credits are \nrecognized as a reduction of tax expense or,  \nfor investments qualifying as investment tax  \ncredits, as a reduction to the related        \ninvestment asset. The Company recognized      \nfederal and state income tax credits related  \nto its affordable housing and other tax-      \nadvantaged investments in tax expense of $ 142\nmillion and $ 132 million for the three months\nended September\u00a030, 2020 and 2019,            \nrespectively, and $ 437 million and $ 423     \nmillion for the nine months ended             \nSeptember\u00a030, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The\nCompany also recognized $ 118 million and $ 80\nmillion of investment tax credits for the     \nthree months ended September\u00a030, 2020 and     \n2019, respectively, and $ 307 million and $   \n326 million for the nine months ended         \nSeptember\u00a030, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The\nCompany recognized $ 142 million and $ 122    \nmillion of expenses related to all of these   \ninvestments for the three months ended        \nSeptember\u00a030, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of \nwhich $ 97 million and $ 80 million,          \nrespectively, were included in tax expense and\nthe remaining amounts were included in        \nnoninterest expense. The Company recognized $ \n429 million and $ 391 million of expenses     \nrelated to all of these investments for the   \nnine months ended September\u00a030, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively, of which $ 297 million and $ 237\nmillion, respectively, were included in tax   \nexpense and the remaining amounts were        \nincluded in noninterest expense.              \nThe Company is not required to consolidate    \nVIEs in which it has concluded it does not    \nhave a controlling financial interest, and    \nthus is not the primary beneficiary. In such  \ncases, the Company does not have both the     \npower to direct the entities\u2019 most significant\nactivities and the obligation to absorb losses\nor the right to receive benefits that could   \npotentially be significant to the VIEs.       \nThe Company\u2019s investments in these            \nunconsolidated VIEs are carried in other      \nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The \nCompany\u2019s unfunded capital and other          \ncommitments related to these unconsolidated   \nVIEs are generally carried in other           \nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe Company\u2019s maximum exposure to loss from   \nthese unconsolidated VIEs include the         \ninvestment recorded on the Company\u2019s          \nConsolidated Balance Sheet, net of unfunded   \ncapital commitments, and previously recorded  \ntax credits which remain subject to recapture \nby taxing authorities based                   \n                      \n  52    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \non compliance features required to be met at  \nthe project level. While the Company believes \npotential losses from these investments are   \nremote, the maximum exposure was determined by\nassuming a scenario where the community-based \nbusiness and housing projects completely fail \nand do not meet certain government compliance \nrequirements resulting in recapture of the    \nrelated tax credits.                          \nThe following table provides a summary of     \ninvestments in community development and tax- \nadvantaged VIEs that the Company has not      \nconsolidated:                                 \n                                              \n  (Dollars         September        December  \n  in                     30,             31,  \n  Millions)             2020            2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Investme\u2026                                   \n  carrying     $       6,552    $      6,148  \n  amount                                      \n  Unfunded                                    \n  capital              3,201           2,938  \n  and other                                   \n  commitme\u2026                                   \n  Maximum                                     \n  exposure            12,085          12,118  \n  to loss                                     \n                                              \nThe Company also has noncontrolling financial \ninvestments in private investment funds and   \npartnerships considered to be VIEs, which are \nnot consolidated. The Company\u2019s recorded      \ninvestment in these entities, carried in other\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, was \napproximately $ 34million at September 30,    \n2020 and $ 31million at December 31, 2019. The\nmaximum exposure to loss related to these VIEs\nwas $ 57million at September 30, 2020 and $   \n55million at December 31, 2019, representing  \nthe Company\u2019s investment balance and its      \nunfunded commitments to invest additional     \namounts.                                      \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s individual net investments in   \nunconsolidated VIEs, which exclude any        \nunfunded capital commitments, ranged from less\nthan $ 1million to $ 80million at September   \n30, 2020, compared with less than $ 1million  \nto $ 87million at December 31, 2019.          \n                                              \nThe Company is required to consolidate VIEs in\nwhich it has concluded it has a controlling   \nfinancial interest. The Company sponsors      \nentities to which it transfers its interests  \nin tax-advantagedinvestments to third parties.\nAt September\u00a030, 2020, approximately $ 3.9    \nbillion of the Company\u2019s assets and $ 3.2     \nbillion of its liabilities included on the    \nConsolidated Balance Sheet were related to    \ncommunity development and tax-advantaged      \ninvestment VIEs which the Company has         \nconsolidated, primarily related to these      \ntransfers. These amounts compared to $ 4.0    \nbillion and $ 3.2 billion, respectively, at   \nDecember\u00a031, 2019. The majority of the assets \nof these consolidated VIEs are reported in    \nother assets, and the liabilities are reported\nin long-term debt and other liabilities. The  \nassets of a particular VIE are the primary    \nsource of funds to settle its obligations. The\ncreditors of the VIEs do not have recourse to \nthe general credit of the Company. The        \nCompany\u2019s exposure to the consolidated VIEs is\ngenerally limited to the carrying value of its\nvariable interests plus any related tax       \ncredits previously recognized or transferred  \nto others with a guarantee.                   \n                                              \nIn addition, the Company sponsors a municipal \nbond securities tender option bond program.   \nThe Company controls the activities of the    \nprogram\u2019s entities, is entitled to the        \nresidual returns and provides liquidity and   \nremarketing arrangements to the program. As a \nresult, the Company has consolidated the      \nprogram\u2019s entities. At September\u00a030, 2020, $  \n2.8 billion of available-for-sale investment  \nsecurities and $ 1.5 billion of short-term    \nborrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet  \nwere related to the tender option bond        \nprogram, compared with $ 3.0 billion of       \navailable-for-sale investment securities and $\n2.7 billion of short-term borrowings at       \nDecember\u00a031, 2019.                            \n                                       \n  Note\u00a06    Mortgage Servicing Rights  \n                                       \nThe Company capitalizes MSRs as separate      \nassets when loans are sold and servicing is   \nretained. MSRs may also be purchased from     \nothers. The Company carries MSRs at fair      \nvalue, with changes in the fair value recorded\nin earnings during the period in which they   \noccur. The Company serviced $ 214.6billion of \nresidential mortgage loans for others at      \nSeptember 30, 2020, and $ 226.0billion at     \nDecember 31, 2019, including subserviced      \nmortgages with no corresponding MSR asset.    \nIncluded in mortgage banking revenue are the  \nMSR fair value changes arising from market    \nrate and model assumption changes, net of the \nvalue change in derivatives used to           \neconomically hedge MSRs. These changes        \nresulted in net gains of $ 9million and net   \nlosses of $ 2million for the three months     \nended September 30, 2020 and 2019,            \nrespectively, and net gains of $ 58million and\nnet losses of $ 5million for the nine months  \nended September 30, 2020 and 2019,            \nrespectively. Loan servicing and ancillary    \nfees, not including valuation changes,        \nincluded in mortgage banking revenue were $   \n177million and $ 188million for the three     \nmonths ended September 30, 2020 and 2019,     \nrespectively, and $ 537million and $          \n547million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.              \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    53  \n                      \nChanges in fair value of capitalized MSRs are \nsummarized as follows:                        \n                                              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026                     \u2026              \n         \u2026          \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026         \u2026    \n         8          6          \u2026         \u2026    \n         \u2026          \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n         1          4          3         4    \n                                              \n         \u2026  )       \u2026  )       \u2026  )      \u2026    \n         \u2026  )       \u2026          \u2026         \u2026    \n         \u2026  )       \u2026  )       \u2026  )      \u2026    \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026         \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n       MSRs sold include those having a       \n  (a)  negative fair value, resulting from    \n       the loans being severely delinquent.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Includes changes in MSR value          \n       associated with changes in market      \n  (b)  interest rates, including estimated    \n       prepayment rates and anticipated       \n       earnings on escrow deposits.           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Includes changes in MSR value not      \n       caused by changes in market interest   \n  (c)  rates, such as changes in assumed      \n       cost to service, ancillary income and  \n       option adjusted spread, as well as     \n       the impact of any model changes.       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Primarily the change in MSR value      \n       from passage of time and cash flows    \n       realized (decay), but also includes    \n  (d)  the impact of changes to expected      \n       cash flows not associated with         \n       changes in market interest rates,      \n       such as the impact of delinquencies.   \n                                              \nThe estimated sensitivity to changes in       \ninterest rates of the fair value of the MSR   \nportfolio and the related derivative          \ninstruments was as follows:                   \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nThe fair value of MSRs and their sensitivity  \nto changes in interest rates is influenced by \nthe mix of the servicing portfolio and        \ncharacteristics of each segment of the        \nportfolio.

On  \nan ongoing basis, numerous federal, state,    \nlocal and foreign examinations are in progress\nand cover multiple tax years. As of September \n30, 2020, federal tax examinations for all    \nyears ending through December 31, 2014 are    \ncompleted and resolved. The Company\u2019s tax     \nreturns for the years ended December 31, 2015,\n2016, 2017 and 2018 are under examination by  \nthe Internal Revenue Service. The years open  \nto examination by foreign, state and local    \ngovernment authorities vary by jurisdiction.  \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s net deferred tax asset was $    \n657million at September 30, 2020 and $        \n382million at December 31, 2019.              \n                                     \n  Note\u00a012    Derivative Instruments  \n                                     \nIn the ordinary course of business, the       \nCompany enters into derivative transactions to\nmanage various risks and to accommodate the   \nbusiness requirements of its customers. The   \nCompany recognizes all derivatives on the     \nConsolidated Balance Sheet at fair value in   \nother assets or in other liabilities. On the  \ndate the Company enters into a derivative     \ncontract, the derivative is designated as     \neither a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge,   \nnet investment hedge, or a designation is not \nmade as it is a customer-related transaction, \nan economic hedge for asset/liability risk    \nmanagement purposes or another stand-alone    \nderivative created through the Company\u2019s      \noperations (\u201cfree-standing derivative\u201d). When \na derivative is designated as a fair value,   \ncash flow or net investment hedge, the Company\nperforms an assessment, at inception and, at a\nminimum, quarterly thereafter, to determine   \nthe effectiveness of the derivative in        \noffsetting changes in the value or cash flows \nof the hedged item(s).                        \nFair Value Hedges These derivatives are       \ninterest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge \nthe change in fair value related to interest  \nrate changes of its underlying fixed-rate     \ndebt. Changes in the fair value of derivatives\ndesignated as fair value hedges, and changes  \nin the fair value of the hedged items, are    \nrecorded in earnings.                         \nCash Flow Hedges These derivatives are        \ninterest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge \nthe forecasted cash flows from its underlying \nvariable-rate debt. Changes in the fair value \nof derivatives designated as cash flow hedges \nare recorded in other comprehensive income    \n(loss) until the cash flows of the hedged     \nitems are realized. If a derivative designated\nas a cash flow hedge is terminated or ceases  \nto be highly effective, the gain or loss in   \nother comprehensive income (loss) is amortized\nto earnings over the period the forecasted    \nhedged transactions impact earnings. If a     \nhedged forecasted transaction is no longer    \nprobable, hedge accounting is ceased and any  \ngain or loss included in other comprehensive  \nincome (loss) is reported in earnings         \nimmediately, unless the forecasted transaction\nis at least reasonably possible of occurring, \nwhereby the amounts remain within other       \ncomprehensive income (loss). At September 30, \n2020, the Company had $ 217million (net-of-   \ntax)of realized and unrealized losses on      \nderivatives classified as cash flow hedges    \nrecorded in other comprehensive income (loss),\ncompared with $ 51million (net-of-tax)of      \nrealized and unrealized losses at December 31,\n2019. The estimated amount to be reclassified \nfrom other comprehensive income (loss) into   \nearnings during the remainder of 2020 and the \nnext 12 months are losses of $ 10million (net-\nof-tax)and $ 40million (net-of-               \ntax),respectively. All cash flow hedges were  \nhighly effective for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2020.                     \nNet Investment Hedges The Company uses forward\ncommitments to sell specified amounts of      \ncertain foreign currencies, and non-          \nderivativedebt instruments, to hedge the      \nvolatility of its net investment in foreign   \noperations driven by fluctuations in foreign  \ncurrency exchange rates. The carrying amount  \nof non-derivativedebt instruments designated  \nas net investment hedges was $ 1.4billion and \n$ 1.3billion at September 30, 2020 and        \nDecember 31, 2019, respectively.              \nOther Derivative Positions The Company enters \ninto free-standing derivatives to mitigate    \ninterest rate risk and for other risk         \nmanagement purposes. These derivatives include\nforward commitments to sell to-be-            \nannouncedsecurities (\u201cTBAs\u201d) and other        \ncommitments to sell residential mortgage      \nloans, which are used to economically hedge   \nthe interest                                  \n                      \n  58    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nrate risk related to mortgage loans held for  \nsale (\u201cMLHFS\u201d) and unfunded mortgage loan     \ncommitments. The Company also enters into     \ninterest rate swaps, swaptions, forward       \ncommitments to buy TBAs, U.S. Treasury and    \nEurodollar futures and options on U.S.        \nTreasury futures to economically hedge the    \nchange in the fair value of the Company\u2019s     \nMSRs. The Company also enters into foreign    \ncurrency forwards to economically hedge       \nremeasurement gains and losses the Company    \nrecognizes on foreign currency denominated    \nassets and liabilities. In addition, the      \nCompany acts as a seller and buyer of interest\nrate derivatives and foreign exchange         \ncontracts for its customers. The Company      \nmitigates the market and liquidity risk       \nassociated with these customer derivatives by \nentering into similar offsetting positions    \nwith broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis  \nby entering into other derivative or non-     \nderivative financial instruments that         \npartially or fully offset the exposure to     \nearnings from these customer-related          \npositions.

The Company measures    \nthat credit risk using a credit valuation     \nadjustment and includes it within the fair    \nvalue of the derivative. The Company manages  \ncounterparty credit risk through              \ndiversification of its derivative positions   \namong various counterparties, by entering into\nderivative positions that are centrally       \ncleared through clearinghouses, by entering   \ninto master netting arrangements and, where   \npossible, by requiring collateral             \narrangements. A master netting arrangement    \nallows two counterparties, who have multiple  \nderivative contracts with each other, the     \nability to net settle amounts under all       \ncontracts, including any related collateral,  \nthrough a single payment and in a single      \ncurrency. Collateral arrangements generally   \nrequire the counterparty to deliver collateral\n(typically cash or U.S. Treasury and agency   \nsecurities) equal to the Company\u2019s net        \nderivative receivable, subject to minimum     \ntransfer and credit rating requirements.      \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    61  \n                      \nThe Company\u2019s collateral arrangements are     \npredominately bilateral and, therefore,       \ncontain provisions that require               \ncollateralization of the Company\u2019s net        \nliability derivative positions. Required      \ncollateral coverage is based on net liability \nthresholds and may be contingent upon the     \nCompany\u2019s credit rating from two of the       \nnationally recognized statistical rating      \norganizations. If the Company\u2019s credit rating \nwere to fall below credit ratings thresholds  \nestablished in the collateral arrangements,   \nthe counterparties to the derivatives could   \nrequest immediate additional collateral       \ncoverage up to and including full collateral  \ncoverage for derivatives in a net liability   \nposition. The aggregate fair value of all     \nderivatives under collateral arrangements that\nwere in a net liability position at September \n30, 2020, was $ 1.5billion. At September 30,  \n2020, the Company had $ 1.3billion of cash    \nposted as collateral against this net         \nliability position.                           \n                                              \n             Netting Arrangements for         \n  Note\u00a013    Certain Financial Instruments    \n             and Securities Financing         \n             Activities                       \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s derivative portfolio consists of\nbilateral over-the-counter trades, certain    \ninterest rate derivatives and credit contracts\nrequired to be centrally cleared through      \nclearinghouses per current regulations, and   \nexchange-traded positions which may include   \nU.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures or       \noptions on U.S. Treasury futures. Of the      \nCompany\u2019s $ 651.1 billion total notional      \namount of derivative positions at             \nSeptember\u00a030, 2020, $ 330.9 billion related to\nbilateral over-the-counter trades, $ 305.7    \nbillion related to those centrally cleared    \nthrough clearinghouses and $ 14.5 billion     \nrelated to those that were exchange-traded.   \nThe Company\u2019s derivative contracts typically  \ninclude offsetting rights (referred to as     \nnetting arrangements), and depending on       \nexpected volume, credit risk, and counterparty\npreference, collateral maintenance may be     \nrequired. For all derivatives under collateral\nsupport arrangements, fair value is determined\ndaily and, depending on the collateral        \nmaintenance requirements, the Company and a   \ncounterparty may receive or deliver           \ncollateral, based upon the net fair value of  \nall derivative positions between the Company  \nand the counterparty. Collateral is typically \ncash, but securities may be allowed under     \ncollateral arrangements with certain          \ncounterparties. Receivables and payables      \nrelated to cash collateral are included in    \nother assets and other liabilities on the     \nConsolidated Balance Sheet, along with the    \nrelated derivative asset and liability fair   \nvalues. Any securities pledged to             \ncounterparties as collateral remain on the    \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Securities        \nreceived from counterparties as collateral are\nnot recognized on the Consolidated Balance    \nSheet, unless the counterparty defaults. In   \ngeneral, securities used as collateral can be \nsold, repledged or otherwise used by the party\nin possession. No restrictions exist on the   \nuse of cash collateral by either party. Refer \nto Note 12 for further discussion of the      \nCompany\u2019s derivatives, including collateral   \narrangements.                                 \nAs part of the Company\u2019s treasury and broker- \ndealer operations, the Company executes       \ntransactions that are treated as securities   \nsold under agreements to repurchase or        \nsecurities purchased under agreements to      \nresell, both of which are accounted for as    \ncollateralized financings. Securities sold    \nunder agreements to repurchase include        \nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned   \ntransactions. Securities purchased under      \nagreements to resell include reverse          \nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed \ntransactions. For securities sold under       \nagreements to repurchase, the Company records \na liability for the cash received, which is   \nincluded in short-term borrowings on the      \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. For securities    \npurchased under agreements to resell, the     \nCompany records a receivable for the cash     \npaid, which is included in other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.                   \nSecurities transferred to counterparties under\nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned   \ntransactions continue to be recognized on the \nConsolidated Balance Sheet, are measured at   \nfair value, and are included in investment    \nsecurities or other assets. Securities        \nreceived from counterparties under reverse    \nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed \ntransactions are not recognized on the        \nConsolidated Balance Sheet unless the         \ncounterparty defaults. The securities         \ntransferred under repurchase and reverse      \nrepurchase transactions typically are U.S.    \nTreasury and agency securities, residential   \nagency mortgage-backed securities or corporate\ndebt securities. The securities loaned or     \nborrowed typically are corporate debt         \nsecurities traded by the Company\u2019s broker-    \ndealer subsidiary. In general, the securities \ntransferred can be sold, repledged or         \notherwise used by the party in possession. No \nrestrictions exist on the use of cash         \ncollateral by either party. Repurchase/reverse\nrepurchase and securities loaned/borrowed     \ntransactions expose the Company to            \ncounterparty risk. The Company manages this   \nrisk by performing assessments, independent of\nbusiness line managers, and establishing      \nconcentration limits on each counterparty.    \nAdditionally, these transactions include      \ncollateral arrangements that require the fair \nvalues of the underlying securities to be     \ndetermined daily, resulting in cash being     \nobtained or refunded to counterparties to     \nmaintain specified collateral levels.         \n                      \n  62    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nThe following table summarizes the maturities \nby category of collateral pledged for         \nrepurchase agreements and securities loaned   \ntransactions:                                 \n                                              \n                 \u2026                \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026                \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026                \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       T\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       6\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       6\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       2\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  1\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       6\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       1\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       50  \n         \u2026       \u2013       \u2013        \u2013       50  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2013    $  \u2013     $  \u2013    $  1\u2026  \n                                              \nThe Company executes its derivative,          \nrepurchase/reverse repurchase and securities  \nloaned/borrowed transactions under the        \nrespective industry standard agreements.

Additionally, from time to   \ntime, the Company may be required to record at\nfair value other assets on a nonrecurring     \nbasis, such as loans held for sale, loans held\nfor investment and certain other assets. These\nnonrecurring fair value adjustments typically \ninvolve application of lower-of-cost-or-fair  \nvalue accounting or impairment write-downs of \nindividual assets.                            \nFair value is defined as the exchange price   \nthat would be received for an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability (an exit price) in the   \nprincipal or most advantageous market for the \nasset or liability in an orderly transaction  \nbetween market participants on the measurement\ndate. A fair value measurement reflects all of\nthe assumptions that market participants would\nuse in pricing the asset or liability,        \nincluding assumptions about the risk inherent \nin a particular valuation technique, the      \neffect of a restriction on the sale or use of \nan asset and the risk of nonperformance.      \nThe Company groups its assets and liabilities \nmeasured at fair value into a three-level     \nhierarchy for valuation techniques used to    \nmeasure financial assets and financial        \nliabilities at fair value. This hierarchy is  \nbased on whether the valuation inputs are     \nobservable or unobservable. These levels are: \n                                              \n       Level\u00a01 \u2014 Quoted prices in active      \n       markets for identical assets or        \n  \u2022    liabilities.

This category includes     \n       MSRs and certain derivative            \n       contracts.                             \n                                              \nValuation Methodologies                       \nThe valuation methodologies used by the       \nCompany to measure financial assets and       \nliabilities at fair value are described below.\nIn addition, the following section includes an\nindication of the level of the fair value     \nhierarchy in which the                        \n                      \n  64    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nassets or liabilities are classified. Where   \nappropriate, the descriptions include         \ninformation about the valuation models and key\ninputs to those models. During the nine months\nended September 30, 2020 and 2019, there were \nno significant changes to the valuation       \ntechniques used by the Company to measure fair\nvalue. Available-For-SaleInvestment Securities\nWhen quoted market prices for identical       \nsecurities are available in an active market, \nthese prices are used to determine fair value \nand these securities are classified within    \nLevel 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 1  \ninvestment securities include U.S. Treasury   \nand exchange-traded securities. For other     \nsecurities, quoted market prices may not be   \nreadily available for the specific securities.\nWhen possible, the Company determines fair    \nvalue based on market observable information, \nincluding quoted market prices for similar    \nsecurities, inactive transaction prices, and  \nbroker quotes. These securities are classified\nwithin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.   \nLevel 2 valuations are generally provided by a\nthird-party pricing service. Level 2          \ninvestment securities are predominantly agency\nmortgage-backed securities, certain other     \nasset-backed securities, obligations of state \nand political subdivisions and agency debt    \nsecurities. Mortgage Loans Held For Sale MLHFS\nmeasured at fair value, for which an active   \nsecondary market and readily available market \nprices exist, are initially valued at the     \ntransaction price and are subsequently valued \nby comparison to instruments with similar     \ncollateral and risk profiles. MLHFS are       \nclassified within Level 2. Included in        \nmortgage banking revenue was a net gain of $  \n97million and $ 10million for the three months\nended September 30, 2020 and 2019,            \nrespectively, and a net gain of $ 271million  \nand $ 53million for the nine months ended     \nSeptember 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively,    \nfrom the changes to fair value of these MLHFS \nunder fair value option accounting guidance.  \nChanges in fair value due to instrument       \nspecific credit risk were immaterial. Interest\nincome for MLHFS is measured based on         \ncontractual interest rates and reported as    \ninterest income on the Consolidated Statement \nof Income. Electing to measure MLHFS at fair  \nvalue reduces certain timing differences and  \nbetter matches changes in fair value of these \nassets with changes in the value of the       \nderivative instruments used to economically   \nhedge them without the burden of complying    \nwith the requirements for hedge accounting.   \nMortgage Servicing Rights MSRs are valued     \nusing a discounted cash flow methodology, and \nare classified within Level 3. The Company    \ndetermines fair value of the MSRs by          \nprojecting future cash flows for different    \ninterest rate scenarios using prepayment rates\nand other assumptions, and discounts these    \ncash flows using a risk adjusted rate based on\noption adjusted spread levels. There is       \nminimal observable market activity for MSRs on\ncomparable portfolios and, therefore, the     \ndetermination of fair value requires          \nsignificant management judgment. Refer to Note\n6 for further information on MSR valuation    \nassumptions. Derivatives The majority of      \nderivatives held by the Company are executed  \nover-the-counteror centrally cleared through  \nclearinghouses and are valued using market    \nstandard cash flow valuation techniques. The  \nmodels incorporate inputs, depending on the   \ntype of derivative, including interest rate   \ncurves, foreign exchange rates and volatility.\nAll derivative values incorporate an          \nassessment of the risk of counterparty        \nnonperformance, measured based on the         \nCompany\u2019s evaluation of credit risk including \nexternal assessments of credit risk. The      \nCompany monitors and manages its              \nnonperformance risk by considering its ability\nto net derivative positions under master      \nnetting arrangements, as well as collateral   \nreceived or provided under collateral         \narrangements. Accordingly, the Company has    \nelected to measure the fair value of          \nderivatives, at a counterparty level, on a net\nbasis. The majority of the derivatives are    \nclassified within Level 2 of the fair value   \nhierarchy, as the significant inputs to the   \nmodels, including nonperformance risk, are    \nobservable. However, certain derivative       \ntransactions are with counterparties where    \nrisk of nonperformance cannot be observed in  \nthe market and, therefore, the credit         \nvaluation adjustments result in these         \nderivatives being classified within Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy. The Company also has\nother derivative contracts that are created   \nthrough its operations, including commitments \nto purchase and originate mortgage loans and  \nswap agreements executed in conjunction with  \nthe sale of a portion of its Class B common   \nand preferred shares of Visa Inc. (the \u201cVisa  \nswaps\u201d). The mortgage loan commitments are    \nvalued by pricing models that include market  \nobservable and unobservable inputs, which     \nresult in the commitments being classified    \nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.   \nThe unobservable inputs include assumptions   \nabout the percentage of commitments that      \nactually become a closed loan and the MSR     \nvalue that is inherent in the underlying loan \nvalue. The Visa swaps require payments by     \neither the Company or the purchaser of the    \nVisa Inc. Class B common and preferred shares \nwhen there are changes in the conversion rate \nof the Visa Inc. Class B common and preferred \nshares to Visa Inc. Class A common and        \npreferred shares, respectively, as well as    \nquarterly payments to the purchaser based on  \nspecified terms of the agreements. Management \nreviews and updates the Visa swaps fair value \nin conjunction with its                       \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    65  \n                      \nreview of Visa Inc. related litigation        \ncontingencies, and the associated escrow      \nfunding. The expected litigation resolution   \nimpacts the Visa Inc. Class B common share to \nVisa Inc. Class A common share conversion     \nrate, as well as the ultimate termination date\nfor the Visa swaps. Accordingly, the Visa     \nswaps are classified within Level 3.

This section includes a        \ndescription of the significant inputs used by \nthe Company and a description of any          \ninterrelationships between these inputs. The  \ndiscussion below excludes nonrecurring fair   \nvalue measurements of collateral value used   \nfor impairment measures for loans and OREO.   \nThese valuations utilize third-party appraisal\nor broker price opinions, and are classified  \nas Level 3 due to the significant judgment    \ninvolved.                                     \n                                              \nMortgage Servicing Rights The significant     \nunobservable inputs used in the fair value    \nmeasurement of the Company\u2019s MSRs are expected\nprepayments and the option adjusted spread    \nthat is added to the risk-free rate to        \ndiscount projected cash flows. Significant    \nincreases in either of these inputs in        \nisolation would have resulted in a            \nsignificantly lower fair value measurement.   \nSignificant decreases in either of these      \ninputs in isolation would have resulted in a  \nsignificantly higher fair value measurement.  \nThere is no direct interrelationship between  \nprepayments and option adjusted spread.       \nPrepayment rates generally move in the        \nopposite direction of market interest rates.  \nOption adjusted spread is generally impacted  \nby changes in market return requirements.     \nThe following table shows the significant     \nvaluation assumption ranges for MSRs at       \nSeptember 30, 2020:                           \n                                              \n                                   Weigh\u2026     \n          Minim\u2026       Maxi\u2026       Avera\u2026     \n                                      (a)     \n  Exp\u2026        13  %       24  %        19  %  \n  pre\u2026                                        \n  Opt\u2026                                        \n  adj\u2026         6          11            7     \n  spr\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Determined based on the relative fair  \n  (a)  value of the related mortgage loans    \n       serviced.                              \n                                              \nDerivatives The Company has two distinct Level\n3 derivative portfolios: (i) the Company\u2019s    \ncommitments to purchase and originate mortgage\nloans that meet the requirements of a         \nderivative and (ii) the Company\u2019s             \nasset/liability and customer-related          \nderivatives that are Level 3 due to           \nunobservable inputs related to measurement of \nrisk of nonperformance by the counterparty. In\naddition, the Company\u2019s Visa swaps are        \nclassified within Level 3.                    \n                                              \nThe significant unobservable inputs used in   \nthe fair value measurement of the Company\u2019s   \nderivative commitments to purchase and        \noriginate mortgage loans are the percentage of\ncommitments that actually become a closed loan\nand the MSR value that is inherent in the     \nunderlying loan value. A significant increase \nin the rate of loans that close would have    \nresulted in a larger derivative asset or      \nliability. A significant increase in the      \ninherent MSR value would have resulted in an  \nincrease in the derivative asset or a         \nreduction in the derivative liability.        \nExpected loan close rates and the inherent MSR\nvalues are directly impacted by changes in    \nmarket rates and will generally move in the   \nsame direction as interest rates.             \nThe following table shows the significant     \nvaluation assumption ranges for the Company\u2019s \nderivative commitments to purchase and        \noriginate mortgage loans at September 30,     \n2020:                                         \n                                              \n                                   Weigh\u2026     \n          Minim\u2026       Maxi\u2026       Avera\u2026     \n                                      (a)     \n  Exp\u2026                                        \n  loan         5  %      100  %        75  %  \n  clo\u2026                                        \n  rate                                        \n  Inh\u2026                                        \n  MSR                                         \n  val\u2026                                        \n  (ba\u2026        19         195          117     \n  poi\u2026                                        \n  per                                         \n  loa\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  (a)  Determined based on the relative fair  \n       value of the related mortgage loans.   \n                                              \nThe significant unobservable input used in the\nfair value measurement of certain of the      \nCompany\u2019s asset/liability and customer-related\nderivatives is the credit valuation adjustment\nrelated to the risk of counterparty           \nnonperformance. A significant increase in the \ncredit valuation adjustment would have        \nresulted in a lower fair value measurement. A \nsignificant decrease in the credit valuation  \nadjustment would have resulted in a higher    \nfair value measurement. The credit valuation  \nadjustment is impacted by changes in market   \nrates, volatility, market implied credit      \nspreads, and loss recovery rates, as well as  \nthe Company\u2019s assessment of the counterparty\u2019s\ncredit position.

In 2007, Visa completed\na restructuring and issued shares of Visa Inc.\ncommon stock to its financial institution     \nmembers in contemplation of its initial public\noffering (\u201cIPO\u201d) completed in the first       \nquarter of 2008 (the \u201cVisa Reorganization\u201d).  \nAs a part of the Visa Reorganization, the     \nCompany received its proportionate number of  \nshares of Visa Inc. common stock, which were  \nsubsequently converted to Class B shares of   \nVisa Inc. (\u201cClass B shares\u201d).                 \nVisa U.S.A. Inc. (\u201cVisa U.S.A.\u201d) and          \nMasterCard International (collectively, the   \n\u201cCard Brands\u201d) are defendants in antitrust    \nlawsuits challenging the practices of the Card\nBrands (the \u201cVisa Litigation\u201d). Visa U.S.A.   \nmember banks have a contingent obligation to  \nindemnify Visa Inc. under the Visa U.S.A.     \nbylaws (which were modified at the time of the\nrestructuring in October 2007) for potential  \nlosses arising from the Visa Litigation. The  \nindemnification by the Visa U.S.A. member     \nbanks has no specific maximum amount. Using   \nproceeds from its IPO and through reductions  \nto the conversion ratio applicable to the     \nClass B shares held by Visa U.S.A. member     \nbanks, Visa Inc. has funded an escrow account \nfor the benefit of member financial           \ninstitutions to fund their indemnification    \nobligations associated with the Visa          \nLitigation. The receivable related to the     \nescrow account is classified in other         \nliabilities as a direct offset to the related \nVisa Litigation contingent liability.         \n  In October 2012, Visa signed a settlement   \n   agreement to resolve class action claims   \nassociated with the multi-district interchange\n   litigation pending in the United States    \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\n York (the \u201cMulti-District Litigation\u201d). The  \n U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit \n reversed the approval of that settlement and \n  remanded the matter to the district court.  \n   Thereafter, the case was split into two    \n putative class actions, one seeking damages  \n (the \u201cDamages Action\u201d) and a separate class  \n  action seeking injunctive relief only (the  \n\u201cInjunctive Action\u201d). In September 2018, Visa \nsigned a new settlement agreement, superseding\nthe original settlement agreement, to resolve \n    the Damages Action. The Damages Action    \n settlement was approved by the United States \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\n  York, but is now on appeal. The Injunctive  \nAction, which generally seeks changes to Visa \n           rules, is still pending.           \nOther Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities   \nThe following table is a summary of other     \nguarantees and contingent liabilities of the  \nCompany at September 30, 2020:                \n                                              \n                                   Maxi\u2026      \n  (D\u2026                              Pote\u2026      \n  in        Coll\u2026       Car\u2026       Futu\u2026      \n  Mi\u2026        Held       Amo\u2026       Paym\u2026      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  St\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026    $      \u2013    $    69    $  9,838      \n  of                                          \n  cr\u2026                                         \n  Th\u2026                                         \n  pa\u2026           \u2013          \u2013           2      \n  bo\u2026                                         \n  ar\u2026                                         \n  Se\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026       5,790          \u2013       5,659      \n  in\u2026                                         \n  As\u2026           \u2013         75       5,148  -a  \n  sa\u2026                                         \n  Me\u2026         668        203       88,5\u2026      \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  Te\u2026                                         \n  op\u2026                                         \n  bo\u2026       2,796          \u2013       2,445      \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  gu\u2026                                         \n  Ot\u2026           \u2013         74       1,450      \n                                              \n                                              \n       The maximum potential future payments  \n       do not include loan sales where the    \n       Company provides standard              \n       representation and warranties to the   \n       buyer against losses related to loan   \n       underwriting documentation defects     \n       that may have existed at the time of   \n       sale that generally are identified     \n       after the occurrence of a triggering   \n       event such as delinquency. For these   \n  (a)  types of loan sales, the maximum       \n       potential future payments is           \n       generally the unpaid principal         \n       balance of loans sold measured at the  \n       end of the current reporting period.   \n       Actual losses will be significantly    \n       less than the maximum exposure, as     \n       only a fraction of loans sold will     \n       have a representation and warranty     \n       breach, and any losses on repurchase   \n       would generally be mitigated by any    \n       collateral held against the loans.     \n                                              \nMerchant Processing The Company, through its  \nsubsidiaries, provides merchant processing    \nservices. Under the rules of credit card      \nassociations, a merchant processor retains a  \ncontingent liability for credit card          \ntransactions processed. This contingent       \nliability arises in the event of a billing    \ndispute between the merchant and a cardholder \nthat is ultimately resolved in the            \ncardholder\u2019s favor. In this situation, the    \ntransaction is \u201ccharged-back\u201d to the merchant \nand the disputed amount is credited or        \notherwise refunded to the cardholder. If the  \nCompany is unable to collect this amount from \nthe merchant, it bears the loss for the amount\nof the refund paid to the cardholder.         \n                      \n  70    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nThe Company currently processes card          \ntransactions in the United States, Canada and \nEurope through wholly-owned subsidiaries and a\nnetwork of other financial institutions. In   \nthe event a merchant was unable to fulfill    \nproduct or services subject to future         \ndelivery, such as airline tickets, the Company\ncould become financially liable for refunding \nthe purchase price of such products or        \nservices purchased through the credit card    \nassociations under the charge-back provisions.\nCharge-back risk related to these merchants is\nevaluated in a manner similar to credit risk  \nassessments and, as such, merchant processing \ncontracts contain various provisions to       \nprotect the Company in the event of default.  \nAt September 30, 2020, the value of airline   \ntickets purchased to be delivered at a future \ndate through card transactions processed by   \nthe Company was $ 12.0billion. The Company    \nheld collateral of $ 517million in escrow     \ndeposits, letters of credit and indemnities   \nfrom financial institutions, and liens on     \nvarious assets. In addition to specific       \ncollateral or other credit enhancements, the  \nCompany maintains a liability for its implied \nguarantees associated with future delivery. At\nSeptember 30, 2020, the liability was $       \n176million primarily related to these airline \nprocessing arrangements. Asset Sales The      \nCompany regularly sells loans to GSEs as part \nof its mortgage banking activities. The       \nCompany provides customary representations and\nwarranties to GSEs in conjunction with these  \nsales. These representations and warranties   \ngenerally require the Company to repurchase   \nassets if it is subsequently determined that a\nloan did not meet specified criteria, such as \na documentation deficiency or rescission of   \nmortgage insurance. If the Company is unable  \nto cure or refute a repurchase request, the   \nCompany is generally obligated to repurchase  \nthe loan or otherwise reimburse the GSE for   \nlosses. At September 30, 2020, the Company had\nreserved $ 19million for potential losses from\nrepresentation and warranty obligations,      \ncompared with $ 9million at December 31, 2019.\nThe Company\u2019s reserve reflects management\u2019s   \nbest estimate of losses for representation and\nwarranty obligations. The Company\u2019s repurchase\nreserve is modeled at the loan level, taking  \ninto consideration the individual credit      \nquality and borrower activity that has        \ntranspired since origination. The model       \napplies credit quality and economic risk      \nfactors to derive a probability of default and\npotential repurchase that are based on the    \nCompany\u2019s historical loss experience, and     \nestimates loss severity based on expected     \ncollateral value. The Company also considers  \nqualitative factors that may result in        \nanticipated losses differing from historical  \nloss trends. As of September 30, 2020 and     \nDecember 31, 2019, the Company had $ 8million \nand $ 10million, respectively, of unresolved  \nrepresentation and warranty claims from GSEs. \nThe Company does not have a significant amount\nof unresolved claims from investors other than\nGSEs. Litigation and Regulatory Matters The   \nCompany is subject to various litigation and  \nregulatory matters that arise in the ordinary \ncourse of its business. The Company           \nestablishes reserves for such matters when    \npotential losses become probable and can be   \nreasonably estimated. The Company believes the\nultimate resolution of existing legal and     \nregulatory matters will not have a material   \nadverse effect on the financial condition,    \nresults of operations or cash flows of the    \nCompany. However, in light of the             \nuncertainties inherent in these matters, it is\npossible that the ultimate resolution of one  \nor more of these matters may have a material  \nadverse effect on the Company\u2019s results from  \noperations for a particular period, and future\nchanges in circumstances or additional        \ninformation could result in additional        \naccruals or resolution in excess of           \nestablished accruals, which could adversely   \naffect the Company\u2019s results from operations, \npotentially materially. Residential Mortgage- \nBacked Securities Litigation Starting in 2011,\nthe Company and other large financial         \ninstitutions have been sued in their capacity \nas trustee for residential mortgage\u2013backed    \nsecurities trusts. In the lawsuits brought    \nagainst the Company, the investors allege that\nthe Company\u2019s banking subsidiary, U.S. Bank   \nNational Association (\u201cU.S. Bank\u201d), as trustee\ncaused them to incur substantial losses by    \nfailing to enforce loan repurchase obligations\nand failing to abide by appropriate standards \nof care after events of default allegedly     \noccurred. The plaintiffs in these matters seek\nmonetary damages in unspecified amounts and   \nmost also seek equitable relief. Regulatory   \nMatters The Company is continually subject to \nexaminations, inquiries and investigations in \nareas of heightened regulatory scrutiny, such \nas compliance, risk management, third-party   \nrisk management and consumer protection. The  \nCompany is cooperating fully with all pending \nexaminations, inquiries and investigations,   \nany of which could lead to administrative or  \nlegal proceedings or settlements. Remedies in \nthese proceedings or settlements may include  \nfines, penalties, restitution or alterations  \nin the Company\u2019s business practices (which may\nincrease the Company\u2019s operating expenses and \ndecrease its revenue). Outlook Due to their   \ncomplex nature, it can be years before        \nlitigation and regulatory matters are         \nresolved. The Company may be unable to develop\nan estimate or range of loss where matters are\nin early stages, there are significant factual\nor legal issues to be resolved, damages are   \nunspecified or uncertain, or there is         \nuncertainty as to a litigation class          \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    71  \n                      \nbeing certified or the outcome of pending     \nmotions, appeals or proceedings. For those    \nlitigation and regulatory matters where the   \nCompany has information to develop an estimate\nor range of loss, the Company believes the    \nupper end of the range of reasonably possible \nlosses in aggregate, in excess of any reserves\nestablished for matters where a loss is       \nconsidered probable, will not be material to  \nits financial condition, results of operations\nor cash flows. The Company\u2019s estimates are    \nsubject to significant judgment and           \nuncertainties, and the matters underlying the \nestimates will change from time to time.      \nActual results may vary significantly from the\ncurrent estimates.                            \n                                \n  Note\u00a016    Business Segments  \n                                \nWithin the Company, financial performance is  \nmeasured by major lines of business based on  \nthe products and services provided to         \ncustomers through its distribution channels.  \nThese operating segments are components of the\nCompany about which financial information is  \nprepared and is evaluated regularly by        \nmanagement in deciding how to allocate        \nresources and assess performance. The Company \nhas five reportable operating segments:       \nCorporate and Commercial Banking Corporate and\nCommercial Banking offers lending, equipment  \nfinance and small-ticket leasing, depository  \nservices, treasury management, capital markets\nservices, international trade services and    \nother financial services to middle market,    \nlarge corporate, commercial real estate,      \nfinancial institution, non-profitand public   \nsector clients.                               \nConsumer and Business Banking Consumer and    \nBusiness Banking delivers products and        \nservices through banking offices, telephone   \nservicing and sales, on-lineservices, direct  \nmail, ATM processing and mobile devices. It   \nencompasses community banking, metropolitan   \nbanking and indirect lending, as well as      \nmortgage banking.                             \nWealth Management and Investment Services     \nWealth Management and Investment Services     \nprovides private banking, financial advisory  \nservices, investment management, retail       \nbrokerage services, insurance, trust, custody \nand fund servicing through four businesses:   \nWealth Management, Global Corporate Trust &   \nCustody, U.S. Bancorp Asset Management and    \nFund Services.                                \nPayment Services Payment Services includes    \nconsumer and business credit cards, stored-   \nvalue cards, debit cards, corporate,          \ngovernment and purchasing card services,      \nconsumer lines of credit and merchant         \nprocessing.                                   \nTreasury and Corporate Support Treasury and   \nCorporate Support includes the Company\u2019s      \ninvestment portfolios, funding, capital       \nmanagement, interest rate risk management,    \nincome taxes not allocated to business        \nsegments, including most investments in tax-  \nadvantagedprojects, and the residual aggregate\nof those expenses associated with corporate   \nactivities that are managed on a consolidated \nbasis.                                        \nBasis of Presentation Business segment results\nare derived from the Company\u2019s business unit  \nprofitability reporting systems by            \nspecifically attributing managed balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and    \ntheir related income or expense. The allowance\nfor credit losses and related provision       \nexpense are allocated to the business segments\naccording to the volume and credit quality of \nthe loan balances managed, but with the impact\nof changes in economic forecasts recorded in  \nTreasury and Corporate Support. Goodwill and  \nother intangible assets are assigned to the   \nbusiness segments based on the mix of business\nof an entity acquired by the Company. Within  \nthe Company, capital levels are evaluated and \nmanaged centrally; however, capital is        \nallocated to the business segments to support \nevaluation of business performance. Business  \nsegments are allocated capital on a risk-     \nadjusted basis considering economic and       \nregulatory capital requirements. Generally,   \nthe determination of the amount of capital    \nallocated to each business segment includes   \ncredit allocations following a Basel III      \nregulatory framework. Interest income and     \nexpense is determined based on the assets and \nliabilities managed by the business segment.  \nBecause funding and asset liability management\nis a central function, funds transfer-pricing \nmethodologies are utilized to allocate a cost \nof funds used or credit for funds provided to \nall business segment assets and liabilities,  \nrespectively, using a matched funding concept.\nAlso, each business unit is allocated the     \ntaxable-equivalent benefit of tax-            \nexemptproducts. The residual effect on net    \ninterest income of asset/liability management \nactivities is included in Treasury and        \nCorporate Support. Noninterest income and     \nexpenses directly managed by each business    \nsegment, including fees, service charges,     \nsalaries and benefits, and other direct       \nrevenues and costs are accounted for within   \neach segment\u2019s financial results in a manner  \nsimilar to the consolidated financial         \nstatements. Occupancy costs are allocated     \nbased on utilization of facilities by the     \nbusiness segments. Generally, operating losses\nare charged to the business segment when the  \nloss event is realized in a manner similar to \na loan charge-off.Noninterest expenses        \nincurred by centrally managed operations or   \nbusiness segments that directly support       \nanother business segment\u2019s operations are     \ncharged to the applicable business segment    \nbased on its utilization of those services,   \n                      \n  72    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nprimarily measured by the volume of customer  \nactivities, number of employees or other      \nrelevant factors. These allocated expenses are\nreported as net shared services expense within\nnoninterest expense. Certain activities that  \ndo not directly support the operations of the \nbusiness segments or for which the business   \nsegments are not considered financially       \naccountable in evaluating their performance   \nare not charged to the business segments. The \nincome or expenses associated with these      \ncorporate activities is reported within the   \nTreasury and Corporate Support business       \nsegment. Income taxes are assessed to each    \nbusiness segment at a standard tax rate with  \nthe residual tax expense or benefit to arrive \nat the consolidated effective tax rate        \nincluded in Treasury and Corporate Support.   \nDesignations, assignments and allocations     \nchange from time to time as management systems\nare enhanced, methods of evaluating           \nperformance or product lines change or        \nbusiness segments are realigned to better     \nrespond to the Company\u2019s diverse customer     \nbase. During 2020, certain organization and   \nmethodology changes were made and,            \naccordingly, 2019 results were restated and   \npresented on a comparable basis.              \n

Legal     \nProceedings \u2014 See the information set forth in\nNote 15 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements under Part I, Item 1 of this       \nReport, which is incorporated herein by       \nreference. Item 1A. Risk Factors \u2014 There are a\nnumber of factors that may adversely affect   \nthe Company\u2019s business, financial results or  \nstock price. These risks are described        \nelsewhere in this report or the Company\u2019s     \nother filings with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, including the Company\u2019s Annual    \nReport on Form 10-Kfor the year ended December\n31, 2019. Additional risks that the Company   \ncurrently does not know about or currently    \nviews as immaterial may also impair the       \nCompany\u2019s business or adversely impact its    \nfinancial results or stock price. There are no\nmaterial changes from the risk factors set    \nforth under Item 1A of the Company\u2019s Annual   \nReport on Form 10-Kfor the year ended December\n31, 2019, and Part II, Item 1A, \u201cRisk         \nFactors,\u201d in the Company\u2019s Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Qfor the quarterly period ended June  \n30, 2020 (the \u201cJune 10-Q\u201d),except that the    \nfollowing risk factor replaces the risk factor\nin the June 10-Q: The Company\u2019s business,     \nfinancial condition, liquidity, capital and   \nresults of operations have been, and will     \nlikely continue to be, adversely affected by  \nthe COVID-19pandemic The COVID-19pandemic has \ncreated economic and financial disruptions    \nthat have adversely affected, and are likely  \nto continue to adversely affect, the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, financial condition, capital,       \nliquidity and results of operations. The      \nCompany cannot predict at this time the extent\nto which it will continue to be negatively    \naffected by the COVID-19pandemic. The extent  \nof any continued or future adverse effects of \nthe COVID-19pandemic will depend on future    \ndevelopments, which are highly uncertain and  \noutside the Company\u2019s control, including the  \nscope and duration of the pandemic, the direct\nand indirect impact of the pandemic on the    \nCompany\u2019s employees, customers, counterparties\nand service providers, as well as other market\nparticipants, and actions taken by            \ngovernmental authorities and other third      \nparties in response to the pandemic. If the   \npandemic is prolonged, or other diseases      \nemerge that give rise to similar effects, the \nadverse impact on the global economy and      \nCompany could deepen. Many of the Company\u2019s   \ncounterparties and third-party service        \nproviders have been, and may further be,      \naffected by \u201cstay-at-home\u201dorders, market      \nvolatility and other factors that increase    \ntheir risks of business disruption or that may\notherwise affect their ability to perform     \nunder the terms of any agreements with the    \nCompany or provide essential services. As a   \nresult, the Company\u2019s operational and other   \nrisks are generally expected to increase until\nthe pandemic subsides. In addition, the       \nCompany\u2019s business operations may be disrupted\nif significant portions of its workforce are  \nunable to work effectively, including because \nof illness, caring for dependents,            \nquarantines, government actions, or other     \nrestrictions in connection with the pandemic. \nThe Company has temporarily, and in some cases\npermanently, closed certain of its offices and\nreduced operating hours and/or lobby services \nat its branches. The Company may also face    \nheightened cybersecurity, information security\nor other operational risks resulting from     \nalternative working arrangements of its       \nemployees. In response to the pandemic and to \nsupport its customers, the Company is offering\nfee waivers, payment deferrals and other      \nexpanded assistance to credit card,           \nautomobile, mortgage, small business and      \npersonal lending customers, including         \ncommitting in certain states in which it      \noperates, to suspend mortgage payments and    \nforeclosure sales for financially impacted    \ncustomers for certain periods of time. A      \nsignificant number of the Company\u2019s customers \nhave already sought to suspend their mortgage \npayments under these programs. Suspensions of \nmortgage payments and foreclosures and reduced\npricing under these programs may adversely    \naffect the Company\u2019s revenue and results of   \noperations. In addition, if these or other    \nmeasures provided by the Company are not      \neffective in mitigating the financial         \nconsequences of COVID-19on customers,         \nincluding providing loans under various newly \ncreated government-sponsored lending programs \nsuch as the Paycheck Protection Program (the  \n\u201cPPP\u201d), the Company may experience higher     \nrates of default, increased credit losses and \nadditional increases in its allowance for     \ncredit losses in future periods. Certain      \nindustries where the Company has credit       \nexposure, including the transportation        \nindustry, and in particular air travel, have  \nexperienced significant operational challenges\nas a result of COVID-19.These negative effects\nhave resulted in a number of corporate lending\nclients making higher than usual draws on     \noutstanding lines of credit over the last     \nseveral months. Many of these customers have  \nsince paid down these draws, but if current   \neconomic conditions                           \n                      \n  U.S.\u00a0Bancorp    79  \n                      \npersist or worsen, client draws on outstanding\nlines of credit may begin to increase again   \nwhich may adversely affect the Company\u2019s      \nliquidity. The economic effects of COVID-19may\nalso cause the Company\u2019s customers to be      \nunable to pay their loans as they come due or \ndecrease the value of collateral, which the   \nCompany expects would cause significant       \nincreases in its credit losses and result in  \nadditional increases in the Company\u2019s         \nallowance for credit losses. In addition, the \nCompany could be exposed to further losses in \nits role as merchant processor of credit card \ntransactions, as under the rules of credit    \ncard associations, a merchant processor       \nretains a contingent liability for credit card\ntransactions processed. In the event a        \nmerchant was unable to fulfill product or     \nservices subject to future delivery, such as  \nairline tickets, the Company could become     \nfinancially liable for refunding to the       \ncardholders the purchase price of such        \nproducts or services purchased through credit \ncard associations, in the event the merchant  \nwas not able to do so. Net interest income is \nsignificantly affected by market rates of     \ninterest. The significant reductions to the   \nfederal funds rate have led to a decrease in  \nthe rates and yields on U.S. Treasury         \nsecurities, in some cases declining below     \nzero. If interest rates are reduced further in\nresponse to COVID-19,the Company\u2019s net        \ninterest income could continue to decline,    \nperhaps significantly. The overall effect of  \nlower interest rates cannot be predicted at   \nthis time and depends on future actions the   \nFederal Reserve may take to increase or reduce\nthe targeted federal funds rate in response to\nthe COVID-19pandemic and resulting economic   \nconditions. The Company, through its          \nsubsidiaries, provides credit and debit card, \ncorporate payments products and merchant      \nprocessing services. Revenues from its payment\nservices businesses depend on consumer and    \nbusiness credit card spending, including at   \nmany small and medium-sized businesses. Due to\nresponses to COVID-19,including stay-at-      \nhomeorders that require businesses other than \nthose defined as essential to close and for   \nconsumers to remain at home unless they are   \nengaged in essential activities, consumer and \nbusiness credit card spending significantly   \ndeclined. Although stay-at-homeorders have    \ngradually been lifted and business activity   \nhas increased, if business closures reoccur,  \nconsumers are reluctant to return to open     \nbusinesses or unemployment continues to stay  \nat elevated levels, the Company expects to    \nexperience further adverse effects on its     \npayment services businesses. This negative    \neffect could continue after the pandemic      \nsubsides if a substantial number of businesses\nwere to close permanently as a result of      \nCOVID-19\u2019seconomic effects or if consumer and \nbusiness spending were to remain depressed.   \nThe effects of the COVID-19pandemic on        \neconomic and market conditions may negatively \naffect the Company\u2019s capital and leverage     \nratios. During 2020 the Federal Reserve       \nimplemented measures, requiring all large bank\nholding companies to preserve capital through \nthe suspension of share repurchase programs   \nand capping common stock dividends to existing\nrates that do not exceed the average of the   \nlast four quarters\u2019 earnings. These capital   \npreservation actions apply to the third and   \nfourth quarters of 2020 but may be extended or\nmodified by the Federal Reserve as economic   \nconditions develop. The COVID-19pandemic may  \ncause the Company to further extend the       \nsuspension of its share repurchase program and\nlimit capital distributions, including        \nreducing or suspending its common stock       \ndividend. Additionally, as a result of the    \nCOVID-19sensitivity analysis conducted by the \nFederal Reserve, banks are required to        \nresubmit capital plans in the fourth quarter  \nof 2020 to reflect current stressed capital   \nconditions. Governmental authorities worldwide\nhave taken unprecedented measures to stabilize\nthe markets and support economic growth.      \nHowever, these measures may not be sufficient \nto address the negative economic effects of   \nCOVID-19or avert severe and prolonged         \nreductions in economic activity. Many         \nfinancial institutions, including the Company,\nhave received inquiries from the United States\nCongress, regulators and other government     \nagencies regarding implementation of          \nprovisions and programs under the Coronavirus \nAid, Relief, and Economic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d)  \nAct, and also are subject to early-stage      \nlitigation concerning their participation in  \nthe PPP under that Act. The Company\u2019s         \ninvolvement in these and other programs       \ncreated in response to the COVID-19pandemic   \nmay lead to additional government and         \nregulatory inquiries and litigation in the    \nfuture, any of which could negatively impact  \nthe Company\u2019s business, reputation, financial \ncondition and results of operations. Other    \nnegative effects of COVID-19and the resulting \neconomic and market disruptions, including    \ncustomer disputes, challenges of transitioning\nemployees back to the workplace, litigation   \nand governmental and regulatory scrutiny of   \nresponse actions taken by the Company, that   \nmay impact the Company\u2019s business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, liquidity, capital and   \nresults of operations cannot be predicted at  \nthis time. However, it is likely that the     \nCompany\u2019s business, financial condition,      \nliquidity, capital and results of operations  \nwill continue to be adversely affected until  \nthe pandemic subsides and the domestic economy\nrecovers. Further, the COVID-19pandemic may   \nalso have the effect of heightening many of   \nthe other risks described in the section      \nentitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in the Company\u2019s 2019 \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.Until the pandemic \nsubsides, the Company expects reduced revenues\nfrom its lending businesses, possible         \nadditional increases in its allowance and     \nrelated provision for credit losses and       \ndecreased                                     \n                      \n  80    U.S.\u00a0Bancorp  \n                      \nrevenue from its payments businesses. Even    \nafter the pandemic subsides, it is possible   \nthat the domestic and other major global      \neconomies will continue to experience a       \nprolonged recession, which the Company expects\nwould adversely affect its business, financial\ncondition, liquidity, capital and results of  \noperations, potentially materially.
