We continue\nto evaluate the\nexpanded use of\nstrategic locations,\nincluding cities in\nwhich we do not\ncurrently have a\npresence.\n\nAs of December 2023,\n41% of our employees\nwere working in\nstrategic locations.\nWe believe our\ninvestment in these\nstrategic locations\nenables us to build\ncenters of excellence\naround specific\ncapabilities that\nsupport our business\ninitiatives.\nSustainability\nWe have a long-\nstanding commitment to\nsustainability. Our\ntwo priorities in this\narea are helping\nclients across\nindustries decarbonize\ntheir businesses to\nsupport their\ntransition to a low-\ncarbon economy\n(Climate Transition)\nand to advance\nsolutions that expand\naccess, increase\naffordability, and\ndrive outcomes to\nsupport sustainable\neconomic growth\n(Inclusive Growth).\nOur strategy is to\nadvance these two\npriorities through our\nwork with our clients,\nand with strategic\npartners whose\nstrengths and areas of\nfocus complement our\nown, as well as\nthrough our supply\nchain.\n\nWe established a\nSustainable Finance\nGroup (SFG), which\nserves as the\ncentralized group that\ndrives climate\nstrategy and\nsustainability efforts\nacross our firm,\nincluding commercial\nefforts alongside our\nbusinesses, to advance\nClimate Transition and\nInclusive Growth.\nSince establishing\nSFG, our sustainable\nfinance-related\nefforts have continued\nto evolve. For\nexample, within Global\nBanking & Markets, we\nestablished the\nSustainable Banking\nGroup, a group focused\non supporting our\ncorporate clients in\nreducing their direct\nand indirect carbon\nemissions. Within\nAsset & Wealth\nManagement there are\nmultiple teams that\nspecialize in\nsustainable investing.\nThe Sustainability &\nImpact Solutions team\nin Asset & Wealth\nManagement also helps\nmobilize the full\nrange of insights,\nadvisory services and\ninvestment solutions\nacross our asset\nmanagement client\nsegments.\n                                     \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    7  \n                                     \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur activities\nrelating to\nsustainability present\nboth financial and\nnonfinancial risks,\nand we have processes\nfor managing these\nrisks, similar to the\nother risks we face.\nWe have integrated\noversight of climate-\nrelated risks into our\nrisk management\ngovernance structure,\nfrom senior management\nto our Board and its\ncommittees, including\nthe Risk and Public\nResponsibilities\ncommittees. The Risk\nCommittee of the Board\noversees firmwide\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial risks,\nwhich include climate\nrisk, and, as part of\nits oversight,\nreceives updates on\nour risk management\napproach to climate\nrisk. The Public\nResponsibilities\nCommittee of the Board\nassists the Board in\nits oversight of our\nfirmwide\nsustainability\nstrategy and\nsustainability issues\naffecting us,\nincluding with respect\nto climate change. As\npart of its oversight,\nthe Public\nResponsibilities\nCommittee receives\nperiodic updates on\nour sustainability\nstrategy, and also\nperiodically reviews\nour governance and\nrelated policies and\nprocesses for\nsustainability and\nclimate change-related\nmatters. We have also\nimplemented an\nEnvironmental Policy\nFramework to guide our\noverall approach to\nsustainability issues.\nWe apply this\nFramework when\nevaluating\ntransactions for\nenvironmental and\nsocial risks and\nimpacts.\n\nOur employees also\nreceive training with\nrespect to\nenvironmental and\nsocial risks,\nincluding for sectors\nand industries that we\nbelieve have higher\npotential for these\nrisks.

We have\ncompleted\nsustainability bond\nissuances, which align\nwith our sustainable\nfinance framework for\nfuture issuances and\nfund a range of on-\nbalance sheet\nsustainable finance\nactivity. We believe\nwe can advance\nsustainability by\npartnering with our\nclients across our\nbusinesses, including\nby developing new\nsustainability-linked\nfinancing solutions,\noffering strategic\nadvice, or co-\ninvesting alongside\nour clients in clean\nenergy companies. We\nhave announced a\ntarget to deploy $750\nbillion in sustainable\nfinancing, investing\nand advisory activity\nby the beginning of\n2030. As of December\n2023, we achieved\napproximately 75% of\nthat goal, with the\nmajority dedicated to\nClimate Transition.\n\nWith respect to\nClimate Transition, we\nhave announced our\ncommitment to align\nour financing\nactivities with a net-\nzero-by-2050 pathway.\nIn that context, we\nhave set an initial\nset of 2030 targets\nfor our energy, power\nand auto manufacturing\nportfolios, three\nsectors where we see\nan opportunity to\nproactively engage our\nclients and investors,\ndeploy capital\nrequired for\ntransition, and invest\nin new commercial\nsolutions to drive\ndecarbonization in the\nreal economy. Carbon\nneutrality is also a\npriority for the\noperation of our firm\nand our supply chain.\nIn 2015, we achieved\ncarbon neutrality in\nour operations and\nbusiness travel, ahead\nof our 2020 goal\nannounced in 2009. We\nhave expanded our\noperational carbon\ncommitment to include\nour supply chain,\ntargeting net-zero\ncarbon emissions by\n2030.\n\nIn addition to Climate\nTransition, our\napproach to\nsustainability also\ncenters on Inclusive\nGrowth where we seek\nto help drive\nsolutions that expand\naccess, increase\naffordability, and\nsupport outcomes to\nadvance sustainable\neconomic growth.\nCommercial solutions\nthat seek to support\nInclusive Growth\ninclude, among others,\nthose of our Urban\nInvestment Group and\nour Sustainable\nInvesting Group. We\nalso seek to support\nInclusive Growth\nthrough sponsored\ninitiatives, such as\nOne Million Black\nWomen , 10,000 Women\nand 10,000 Small\nBusinesses . An\noverarching theme of\nour sustainability\nstrategy is promoting\ndiversity and\ninclusion as an\nimperative for us, as\nwell as for our\nclients and their\nboards. These efforts\nare further\nstrengthened by\nstrategic partnerships\nthat we have\nestablished in areas\nwhere we have\nidentified gaps or\nbelieve we are able to\ndrive even greater\nimpact through\ncollaboration. We\nbelieve our ability to\nachieve our\nsustainability\nobjectives is\ncritically dependent\non the strengths and\ntalents of our people,\nand we recognize that\nour people are able to\nmaximize their impact\nby collaborating in a\ndiverse and inclusive\nwork environment.

AND\nSUBSIDIARIES\n\nCompetition\nThe financial services\nindustry and all of\nour businesses are\nintensely competitive,\nand we expect them to\nremain so. Our\ncompetitors provide\ninvestment banking,\nmarket-making and\nasset management\nservices, private\nbanking and lending,\ncommercial lending,\ncredit cards,\ntransaction banking,\ndeposit-taking and\nother banking products\nand services, and make\ninvestments in\nsecurities,\ncommodities,\nderivatives, real\nestate, loans and\nother financial\nassets. Our\ncompetitors include\nbrokers and dealers,\ninvestment banking\nfirms, commercial\nbanks, credit card\nissuers, insurance\ncompanies, investment\nadvisers, mutual\nfunds, hedge funds,\nprivate equity funds,\nmerchant banks,\nconsumer finance\ncompanies and\nfinancial technology\nand other internet-\nbased companies. Some\nof our competitors\noperate globally and\nothers regionally, and\nwe compete based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding transaction\nexecution, client\nexperience, products\nand services,\ninnovation, reputation\nand price.\n\nWe have faced, and\nexpect to continue to\nface, pressure to\nretain market share by\ncommitting capital to\nbusinesses or\ntransactions on terms\nthat offer returns\nthat may not be\ncommensurate with\ntheir risks. In\nparticular, corporate\nclients seek such\ncommitments (such as\nagreements to\nparticipate in their\nloan facilities) from\nfinancial services\nfirms in connection\nwith investment\nbanking and other\nassignments.\n\nConsolidation and\nconvergence have\nsignificantly\nincreased the capital\nbase and geographic\nreach of some of our\ncompetitors and have\nalso hastened the\nglobalization of the\nsecurities and other\nfinancial services\nmarkets. As a result,\nwe have had to commit\ncapital to support our\ninternational\noperations and to\nexecute large global\ntransactions. To\ncapitalize on some of\nour most significant\nopportunities, we will\nhave to compete\nsuccessfully with\nfinancial institutions\nthat are larger and\nhave more capital and\nthat may have a\nstronger local\npresence and longer\noperating history\noutside the U.S.\n\nWe also compete with\nsmaller institutions\nthat offer more\ntargeted services,\nsuch as independent\nadvisory firms. Some\nclients may perceive\nthese firms to be less\nsusceptible to\npotential conflicts of\ninterest than we are,\nand, as described\nbelow, our ability to\neffectively compete\nwith them could be\naffected by\nregulations and\nlimitations on\nactivities that apply\nto us but may not\napply to them.\n\nA number of our\nbusinesses are subject\nto intense price\ncompetition. Efforts\nby our competitors to\ngain market share have\nresulted in pricing\npressure in our\ninvestment banking,\nmarket-making,\nconsumer, wealth\nmanagement and asset\nmanagement businesses.\nFor example, the\nincreasing volume of\ntrades executed\nelectronically,\nthrough the internet\nand through\nalternative trading\nsystems, has increased\nthe pressure on\ntrading commissions,\nin that commissions\nfor electronic trading\nare generally lower\nthan those for non-\nelectronic trading. It\nappears that this\ntrend toward low-\ncommission trading\nwill continue. Price\ncompetition has also\nled to compression in\nthe difference between\nthe price at which a\nmarket participant is\nwilling to sell an\ninstrument and the\nprice at which another\nmarket participant is\nwilling to buy it\n(i.e., bid/offer\nspread), which has\naffected our market-\nmaking businesses. The\nincreasing prevalence\nof passive investment\nstrategies that\ntypically have lower\nfees than other\nstrategies we offer\nhas affected the\ncompetitive and\npricing dynamics for\nour asset management\nproducts and services.\nIn addition, we\nbelieve that we will\ncontinue to experience\ncompetitive pressures\nin these and other\nareas in the future as\nsome of our\ncompetitors seek to\nobtain market share by\nfurther reducing\nprices, and as we\nenter into or expand\nour presence in\nmarkets that rely more\nheavily on electronic\ntrading and execution.\nWe and other banks\nalso compete for\ndeposits on the basis\nof the rates we offer.\nIncreases in short-\nterm interest rates\nhave resulted in and\nmay continue to result\nin more intense\ncompetition in deposit\npricing, as well as\ncompetition from non-\ndeposit financial\nproducts.\n\nWe also compete on the\nbasis of the types of\nfinancial products and\nclient experiences\nthat we and our\ncompetitors offer. In\nsome circumstances,\nour competitors may\noffer financial\nproducts that we do\nnot offer and that our\nclients may prefer,\nincluding\ncryptocurrencies and\nother digital assets\nthat we cannot or may\nchoose not to provide.\nOur competitors may\nalso develop\ntechnology platforms\nthat provide a better\nclient experience.\n                                     \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    9  \n                                     \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

For\nexample, the\nprovisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act that\nprohibit proprietary\ntrading and restrict\ninvestments in certain\nhedge and private\nequity funds\ndifferentiate between\nU.S.-based and\nnon-U.S.-based banking\norganizations and give\nnon-U.S.-based banking\norganizations greater\nflexibility to trade\noutside of the U.S.\nand to form and invest\nin funds outside the\nU.S.\n\nLikewise, the\nobligations with\nrespect to derivative\ntransactions under\nTitle VII of the Dodd-\nFrank Act depend, in\npart, on the location\nof the counterparties\nto the transaction.\nThe impact of\nregulatory\ndevelopments on our\ncompetitive position\nhas depended and will\ncontinue to depend to\na large extent on the\nmanner in which the\nrequired rulemaking\nand regulatory\nguidance evolve, the\nextent of\ninternational\nconvergence, and the\ndevelopment of market\npractice and\nstructures under the\nevolving regulatory\nregimes, as described\nfurther in\n\u201cRegulation\u201d below.\n\nWe also face intense\ncompetition in\nattracting and\nretaining qualified\nemployees.

The\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer is\ndesigned to counteract\nsystemic\nvulnerabilities and\ncurrently applies only\nto banking\norganizations subject\nto Category I, II or\nIII standards,\nincluding us and GS\nBank USA. Several\nother national\nsupervisors also\nrequire\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffers. The\nG-SIB surcharge and\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer\napplicable to us may\nchange in the future,\nincluding due to\nadditional guidance\nfrom our regulators\nand/or positional\nchanges. As a result,\nthe minimum capital\nratios to which we are\nsubject are likely to\nchange over time.\n\nThe U.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies\nhave adopted a rule\nthat implements the\nBasel Committee\u2019s\nstandardized approach\nfor measuring\ncounterparty credit\nrisk exposures in\nconnection with\nderivative contracts\n(SA-CCR). Under the\nrule, \u201cAdvanced\napproach\u201d banking\norganizations are\nrequired to use SA-CCR\nin the calculation of\ntheir standardized\nrisk-weighted assets\n(RWAs) and, with some\nadjustments, in the\ndetermination of their\nsupplementary leverage\nratios (SLRs)\ndiscussed below.\n\nThe capital\nrequirements\napplicable to GSBE,\nGSI and GSIB include\nboth minimum\nrequirements and\nbuffers. See\n\u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof Operations \u2014\nCapital Management and\nRegulatory Capital\u201d in\nPart II, Item 7 of\nthis Form 10\u2011K and\nNote 20 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements in Part II,\nItem 8 of this Form\n10\u2011K for information\nabout our capital\nratios and those of GS\nBank USA, GSBE, GSI\nand GSIB.\n\nThe Basel Committee\nstandards include\nguidelines for\ncalculating\nincremental capital\nratio requirements for\nbanking institutions\nthat are systemically\nsignificant from a\ndomestic but not\nglobal perspective\n(D-SIBs). Depending on\nhow these guidelines\nare implemented by\nnational regulators,\nthey may apply to\ncertain subsidiaries\nof G-SIBs. These\nguidelines are in\naddition to the\nframework for G-SIBs,\nbut are more\nprinciples-based. The\nU.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies\nhave not designated\nany D-SIBs. The CRD\nand CRR provide that\ninstitutions that are\nsystemically important\nat the E.U. or member\nstate level, known as\nother systemically\nimportant institutions\n(O-SIIs), may be\nsubject to additional\ncapital ratio\nrequirements,\naccording to their\ndegree of systemic\nimportance (O-SII\nbuffers). BaFin has\nidentified GSBE as an\nO-SII in Germany and\nset an O-SII buffer.\n\nIn the U.K., the PRA\nhas identified Goldman\nSachs Group UK Limited\n(GSG UK), the parent\ncompany of GSI and\nGSIB, as an O-SII but\nhas not applied an\nO-SII buffer.\n\nThe Basel Committee\nhas finalized\nrevisions to the Basel\nIII Capital\nRequirements (Basel\nIII Revisions), and in\nJuly 2023, the U.S.\nbank regulatory\nagencies proposed a\nrule implementing the\nBasel III Revisions\nand the Fundamental\nReview of the Trading\nBook (FRTB). The FRTB,\namong other things,\nrevises the\nstandardized and\ninternal model-based\napproaches used to\ncalculate market risk\nrequirements and\nclarifies the scope of\npositions subject to\nmarket risk capital\nrequirements.\n                                      \n  12    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe proposed effective\ndate for the U.S.\nproposal is July 1,\n2025, with a three-\nyear transition period\nfor the calculation of\nExpanded Risk-Based\napproach RWAs. The\nproposal includes the\nreplacement of the\nAdvanced approach with\nan Expanded Risk-Based\napproach, which\neliminates the use of\ninternal models to\ncalculate RWAs for\ncredit and operational\nrisk. The proposal\nincorporates the\napplication of the SCB\nrequirements in the\nExpanded Risk-Based\napproach. The credit\nrisk component of the\nExpanded Risk-Based\napproach would include\nnew risk weights for\nmany counterparty and\nexposure types, a\nrevised collateral\nhaircut approach for\ncertain collateralized\ntransactions and\nadditional\nrestrictions for\nrecognizing collateral\nin certain securities\nfinancing\ntransactions. Under\nthe proposed rules,\nthe RWAs for\noperational risk would\nbe calculated\nprimarily based on\nrevenues and\nhistorical losses. In\naddition, the proposal\nintroduces the FRTB,\nwhich would replace\nthe market risk rule\nfor both the\nStandardized and\nExpanded Risk-Based\napproaches and\nintroduce a new credit\nvaluation adjustment\n(CVA) risk RWA\ncalculation for the\nExpanded Risk-Based\napproach. We continue\nto evaluate the impact\nof the proposed rules,\nbut we preliminarily\nestimate that under\nthese rules, if\nadopted as proposed\nand if our assets and\nliabilities remain\nlargely consistent\nwith those as of\nDecember 2023, our\nregulatory capital\nrequirements could\nincrease by\napproximately 25% on a\nfully phased-in basis.\n\nThe European\nCommission has\nproposed rules to\nimplement the Basel\nIII Revisions and the\nFRTB, and the Council\nof the E.U. has\npublished the\nconsolidated version\nreflecting the E.U.\ntrilogue agreement.\nThe agreed E.U.\nproposal contemplates\namendments to the CRR\nand the CRD, referred\nto as CRR III and CRD\nVI, generally taking\neffect in January\n2025. The proposed\namendments include\nrevised rules for\nmarket risk capital, a\nnew standardized\napproach for\noperational risk and\nCVA risk capital and a\nfloor on internally\nmodeled capital\nrequirements at a\npercentage of the\ncapital requirements\nunder the standardized\napproach, commonly\nknown as the \u201coutput\nfloor.\u201d\n\nIn December 2023, the\nPRA issued near final\nmarket risk rules for\nthe U.K. which are\nexpected to be\neffective from July 1,\n2025. The PRA also\nissued its\nconsultation on the\nimplementation of the\nBasel III Revisions,\nwith a proposed\neffective date of July\n1, 2025. Under the PRA\nconsultation, our U.K.\nsubsidiaries are not\nexpected to be subject\nto a floor on\ninternally modeled\ncapital requirements.\nThe PRA has also\npublished near final\nrules for CVA risk,\ncounterparty credit\nrisk and operational\nrisk, in addition to\nmarket risk.\n\nThe Basel Committee\nhas published an\nupdated securitization\nframework and a\nrevised G-SIB\nassessment\nmethodology. The U.S.\nfederal bank\nregulatory agencies\u2019\nJuly 2023 proposal\nwould implement the\nupdated securitization\nframework. The updated\nsecuritization\nframework has been\nimplemented in the\nE.U. and U.K.\n\nThe Basel Committee\nhas also published a\nfinal standard on the\nprudential treatment\nof cryptoasset\nexposures. The Basel\nCommittee contemplates\nthat national\nregulators will have\nincorporated the\nstandard into local\ncapital requirements\nby January 1, 2025.\nU.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies\nand E.U. and U.K.\nauthorities have not\nyet proposed rules\nimplementing the\nstandards.\n\nLeverage Ratios. Under\nthe Capital Framework,\nwe and GS Bank USA are\nsubject to Tier 1\nleverage ratios and\nSLRs established by\nthe FRB. As a G-SIB,\nthe SLR requirements\napplicable to us\ninclude both a minimum\nrequirement and a\nbuffer requirement,\nwhich operates in the\nsame manner as the\nrisk-based buffer\nrequirements described\nabove. In April 2018,\nthe FRB and the OCC\nissued a proposed rule\nwhich would (i)\nreplace the current 2%\nSLR buffer for G-SIBs,\nincluding us, with a\nbuffer equal to 50% of\ntheir G-SIB surcharge\nand (ii) revise the 6%\nSLR requirement for\nCategory I banks, such\nas GS Bank USA, to be\n\u201cwell capitalized\u201d\nwith a requirement\nequal to 3% plus 50%\nof their parent\u2019s\nG-SIB surcharge.\n\nGSBE and certain of\nour U.K. entities are\nalso subject to\nrequirements relating\nto leverage ratios,\nwhich are generally\nbased on the Basel\nCommittee leverage\nratio standards.\n\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof Operations \u2014\nCapital Management and\nRegulatory Capital\u201d in\nPart II, Item 7 of\nthis Form 10-K and\nNote 20 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements in Part II,\nItem 8 of this Form\n10-K for information\nabout our and GS Bank\nUSA\u2019s Tier 1 leverage\nratios and SLRs, and\nGSI\u2019s leverage ratio.\n\nLiquidity Ratios. The\nBasel Committee\u2019s\nframework for\nliquidity risk\nmeasurement, standards\nand monitoring\nrequires banking\norganizations to\nmeasure their\nliquidity against two\nspecific liquidity\ntests: the Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio (LCR)\nand the Net Stable\nFunding Ratio (NSFR).\n\nThe LCR rule issued by\nthe U.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies\nand applicable to both\nus and GS Bank USA is\ngenerally consistent\nwith the Basel\nCommittee\u2019s framework\nand is designed to\nensure that a banking\norganization maintains\nan adequate level of\nunencumbered, high-\nquality liquid assets\nequal to or greater\nthan the expected net\ncash outflows under an\nacute short-term\nliquidity stress\nscenario. We and GS\nBank USA are required\nto maintain a minimum\nLCR of 100%.\n\nGSBE is subject to the\nLCR rule approved by\nthe European\nParliament and\nCouncil, and GSI and\nGSIB are subject to\nthe U.K. regulatory\nauthorities\u2019 LCR\nrules, which are\ngenerally consistent\nwith the Basel\nCommittee\u2019s framework.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    13  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\nCRR implements the\nNSFR for certain E.U.\nfinancial\ninstitutions,\nincluding GSBE. The\nNSFR requirement\nimplemented in the\nU.K. is applicable to\nboth GSI and GSIB.\n\nThe FRB\u2019s enhanced\nprudential standards\nrequire BHCs with $100\nbillion or more in\ntotal consolidated\nassets to comply with\nenhanced liquidity and\noverall risk\nmanagement standards,\nwhich include\nmaintaining a level of\nhighly liquid assets\nbased on projected\nfunding needs for 30\ndays, and increased\ninvolvement by boards\nof directors in\nliquidity and overall\nrisk management.\nAlthough the liquidity\nrequirement under\nthese rules has some\nsimilarities to the\nLCR, it is a separate\nrequirement. GSBE also\nhas its own liquidity\nplanning process,\nwhich incorporates\ninternally designed\nstress tests and those\nrequired under German\nregulatory\nrequirements and the\nECB Guide to Internal\nLiquidity Adequacy\nAssessment Process\n(ILAAP).

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nLimitations on the\nPayment of Dividends.\nU.S. federal and state\nlaws impose\nlimitations on the\npayment of dividends\nby U.S. depository\ninstitutions, such as\nGS Bank USA. In\ngeneral, the amount of\ndividends that may be\npaid by GS Bank USA is\nlimited to the lesser\nof the amounts\ncalculated under a\nrecent earnings test\nand an undivided\nprofits test. Under\nthe recent earnings\ntest, a dividend may\nnot be paid if the\ntotal of all dividends\ndeclared by the entity\nin any calendar year\nis in excess of the\ncurrent year\u2019s net\nincome combined with\nthe retained net\nincome of the two\npreceding years,\nunless the entity\nobtains regulatory\napproval. Under the\nundivided profits\ntest, a dividend may\nnot be paid in excess\nof the entity\u2019s\nundivided profits\n(generally,\naccumulated net\nprofits that have not\nbeen paid out as\ndividends or\ntransferred to\nsurplus), unless the\nentity receives\nregulatory and\nstockholder approval.\n\nThe applicable U.S.\nbanking regulators\nhave authority to\nprohibit or limit the\npayment of dividends\nif, in the banking\nregulator\u2019s opinion,\npayment of a dividend\nwould constitute an\nunsafe or unsound\npractice in light of\nthe financial\ncondition of the\nbanking organization.\n\nSource of Strength.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\nrequires BHCs to act\nas a source of\nstrength to their U.S.\nbank subsidiaries and\nto commit capital and\nfinancial resources to\nsupport those\nsubsidiaries. This\nsupport may be\nrequired by the FRB at\ntimes when BHCs might\notherwise determine\nnot to provide it.\nCapital loans by a BHC\nto a U.S. subsidiary\nbank are subordinate\nin right of payment to\ndeposits and to\ncertain other\nindebtedness of the\nsubsidiary bank. In\naddition, if a BHC\ncommits to a U.S.\nfederal banking agency\nthat it will maintain\nthe capital of its\nbank subsidiary,\nwhether in response to\nthe FRB\u2019s invoking its\nsource-of-strength\nauthority or in\nresponse to other\nregulatory measures,\nthat commitment will\nbe assumed by the\nbankruptcy trustee for\nthe BHC and the bank\nwill be entitled to\npriority payment in\nrespect of that\ncommitment, ahead of\nother creditors of the\nBHC.\n\nTransactions Between\nAffiliates.\nTransactions between\nGS Bank USA or its\nsubsidiaries,\nincluding GSBE, and\nGroup Inc. or its\nother subsidiaries and\naffiliates are subject\nto restrictions under\nthe Federal Reserve\nAct and regulations\nissued by the FRB.\nThese laws and\nregulations generally\nlimit the types and\namounts of\ntransactions (such as\nloans and other credit\nextensions, including\ncredit exposure\narising from resale\nagreements, securities\nborrowing and\nderivative\ntransactions, from GS\nBank USA or its\nsubsidiaries to Group\nInc. or its other\nsubsidiaries and\naffiliates and\npurchases of assets by\nGS Bank USA or its\nsubsidiaries from\nGroup Inc. or its\nother subsidiaries and\naffiliates) that may\ntake place and\ngenerally require\nthose transactions, to\nthe extent permitted,\nto be on market terms\nor better to GS Bank\nUSA or its\nsubsidiaries. These\nlaws and regulations\ngenerally do not apply\nto transactions\nbetween GS Bank USA\nand its subsidiaries.\nSimilarly, German\nregulatory\nrequirements provide\nthat certain\ntransactions between\nGSBE and GS Bank USA\nor its other\naffiliates, including\nGroup Inc., must be on\nmarket terms and are\nsubject to special\ninternal approval\nrequirements. PRA\nrules also provide\nrequirements for\ntransactions between\nGSI and GSIB and their\nrespective affiliates.\n\nResolution and\nRecovery Plans. We are\nrequired by the FRB\nand the FDIC to submit\na periodic plan for\nour rapid and orderly\nresolution in the\nevent of material\nfinancial distress or\nfailure (resolution\nplan). If these\nregulators jointly\ndetermine that an\ninstitution has failed\nto remediate\nidentified\nshortcomings in its\nresolution plan or\nthat its resolution\nplan, after any\npermitted\nresubmission, is not\ncredible or would not\nfacilitate an orderly\nresolution under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code,\nthey may jointly\nimpose more stringent\ncapital, leverage or\nliquidity requirements\nor restrictions on\ngrowth, activities or\noperations, or may\njointly order the\ninstitution to divest\nassets or operations,\nin order to facilitate\norderly resolution in\nthe event of failure.\nThe FRB and FDIC\nrequire U.S. G-SIBs to\nsubmit resolution\nplans every two years\n(alternating between\nsubmissions of full\nplans and targeted\nplans that include\nonly select\ninformation). We\nsubmitted our 2023\nresolution plan, which\nwas a full submission,\nin June 2023. Our next\nrequired submission is\na targeted submission\nby July 1, 2025.

GS Bank\nUSA\u2019s most recent\nresolution plan was\nsubmitted in December\n2023. In August 2023,\nthe FDIC proposed to\nrevise its current\nrule that requires the\nsubmission of\nresolution plans by\ninsured depository\ninstitutions (IDIs)\nwith $50 billion or\nmore in total assets.\nThe proposal would\nrevise the\nrequirements regarding\nthe content and timing\nof resolution\nsubmissions, as well\nas interim supplements\nto those submissions\nprovided to the FDIC.\nUnder the proposal,\nIDIs with $100 billion\nor more in total\nassets, including GS\nBank USA, would submit\nfull resolution plans\nbiennially.\n\nThe U.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies\nhave adopted rules\nimposing restrictions\non qualified financial\ncontracts (QFCs)\nentered into by\nG-SIBs. The rules are\nintended to facilitate\nthe orderly resolution\nof a failed G-SIB by\nlimiting the ability\nof the G-SIB to enter\ninto a QFC unless (i)\nthe counterparty\nwaives certain default\nrights in such\ncontract arising upon\nthe entry of the G\u2011SIB\nor one of its\naffiliates into\nresolution, (ii) the\ncontract does not\ncontain enumerated\nprohibitions on the\ntransfer of such\ncontract and/or any\nrelated credit\nenhancement, and (iii)\nthe counterparty\nagrees that the\ncontract will be\nsubject to the special\nresolution regimes set\nforth in the Dodd-\nFrank Act orderly\nliquidation authority\n(OLA) and the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Act\nof 1950 (FDIA),\ndescribed below. GS\nBank USA has achieved\ncompliance by adhering\nto the International\nSwaps and Derivatives\nAssociation Universal\nResolution Stay\nProtocol (ISDA\nUniversal Protocol)\nand International\nSwaps and Derivatives\nAssociation 2018 U.S.\nResolution Stay\nProtocol (U.S. ISDA\nProtocol) described\nbelow.\n\nCertain of our other\nsubsidiaries also\nadhere to these\nprotocols. The ISDA\nUniversal Protocol\nimposes a stay on\ncertain cross-default\nand early termination\nrights within standard\nISDA derivative\ncontracts and\nsecurities financing\ntransactions between\nadhering parties in\nthe event that one of\nthem is subject to\nresolution in its home\njurisdiction,\nincluding a resolution\nunder OLA or the FDIA\nin the U.S. The U.S.\nISDA Protocol, which\nwas based on the ISDA\nUniversal Protocol,\nwas created to allow\nmarket participants to\ncomply with the final\nQFC rules adopted by\nthe federal bank\nregulatory agencies.\n\nThe E.U. Bank Recovery\nand Resolution\nDirective (BRRD), as\namended by the BRRD\nII, establishes a\nframework for the\nrecovery and\nresolution of\nfinancial institutions\nin the E.U., such as\nGSBE. The BRRD\nprovides national\nsupervisory\nauthorities with tools\nand powers to pre-\nemptively address\npotential financial\ncrises in order to\npromote financial\nstability and minimize\ntaxpayers\u2019 exposure to\nlosses. The BRRD\nrequires E.U. member\nstates to grant\ncertain resolution\npowers to national\nand, where relevant,\nE.U. resolution\nauthorities, including\nthe power to impose a\ntemporary stay and to\nrecapitalize a failing\nentity by writing down\nits unsecured debt or\nconverting its\nunsecured debt into\nequity. Financial\ninstitutions in the\nE.U. must provide that\ncontracts governed by\nnon-E.U. law recognize\nthose temporary stay\nand bail-in powers\nunless doing so would\nbe impracticable. GSBE\nis under the direct\nauthority of the\nSingle Resolution\nBoard for resolution\nplanning. E.U. law\nrequires financial\ninstitutions in the\nE.U., including\nsubsidiaries of\nnon-E.U. groups, to\nsubmit recovery plans\nand to assist the\nrelevant resolution\nauthority in\nconstructing\nresolution plans for\nthe E.U. entities.\nGSBE\u2019s primary\nregulator with respect\nto recovery planning\nis the ECB, and it is\nalso regulated by\nBaFin and Deutsche\nBundesbank.\n\nThe U.K. Special\nResolution Regime\nconfers substantially\nthe same powers on the\nBank of England, as\nthe U.K. resolution\nauthority, and\nsubstantially the same\nrequirements on U.K.\nfinancial\ninstitutions.

The\nFRB\u2019s TLAC rule, among\nother things,\nestablishes minimum\nTLAC requirements and\nestablishes minimum\nrequirements for\n\u201celigible long-term\ndebt\u201d (i.e., debt that\nis unsecured, has a\nmaturity of at least\none year from issuance\nand satisfies certain\nadditional criteria).\nIn August 2023, the\nFRB proposed to\nintroduce a minimum\ndenomination\nrequirement for\neligible long-term\ndebt, among other\nchanges.\n\nThe rule also\nprohibits a BHC that\nhas been designated as\na U.S. G-SIB from (i)\nguaranteeing\nsubsidiaries\u2019\nliabilities that are\nsubject to early\ntermination provisions\nif the BHC enters into\nan insolvency or\nreceivership\nproceeding, subject to\nan exception for\nguarantees permitted\nby rules of the U.S.\nfederal banking\nagencies imposing\nrestrictions on QFCs;\n(ii) incurring\nliabilities guaranteed\nby subsidiaries; (iii)\nissuing short-term\ndebt to third parties;\nor (iv) entering into\nderivatives and\ncertain other\nfinancial contracts\nwith external\ncounterparties.\n\nAdditionally, the rule\ncaps, at 5% of the\nvalue of the parent\ncompany\u2019s eligible\nTLAC, the amount of\nunsecured non-\ncontingent third-party\nliabilities that are\nnot eligible long-term\ndebt that could rank\nequally with or junior\nto eligible long-term\ndebt.\n\nThe CRR, the BRRD and\nU.K. financial\nservices regime also\nimpose minimum TLAC\nrequirements on\nG-SIBs. For example,\nthe CRR requires E.U.\nsubsidiaries of a\nnon-E.U. G-SIB that\nexceed the threshold\nof 5% of the G-SIB\u2019s\nRWAs, operating income\nor leverage exposure,\nsuch as GSBE, to meet\ninternal TLAC\nrequirements. Under\nthe U.K. financial\nservices regime, GSG\nUK exceeds the\napplicable thresholds\nand therefore, it is\nsubject to internal\nTLAC requirements.\n\nThe CRD required a\nnon-E.U. group with\nmore than \u20ac40 billion\nof assets in the E.U.,\nsuch as us, to\nestablish an E.U.\nintermediate holding\ncompany (E.U. IHC) by\nDecember 30, 2023 if\nit has, as in our\ncase, two or more of\ncertain types of E.U.\nfinancial institution\nsubsidiaries,\nincluding broker-\ndealers and banks. A\nnon-E.U. group may\nhave two E.U. IHCs if\na request for a second\nis approved, and in\nSeptember 2023, the\nECB granted GSBE and\nGSPIC an exemption to\noperate under two E.U.\nIHCs. The CRR requires\nE.U. IHCs to satisfy\ncapital and liquidity\nrequirements, a\nminimum requirement\nfor own funds and\neligible liabilities\n(MREL), and certain\nother prudential\nrequirements at a\nconsolidated level.\nThe U.K. has not\nimplemented a similar\nrequirement to\nestablish an IHC;\nhowever, the PRA has\nintroduced a\nrequirement that\ncertain U.K. financial\nholding companies or a\ndesignated U.K. group\nentity be responsible\nfor the U.K. group\u2019s\nregulatory compliance.\nWe have designated GSI\nfor that\nresponsibility.\n\nThe BRRD II and the\nU.K. resolution regime\nsubject institutions\nto an MREL, which is\ngenerally consistent\nwith the Financial\nStability Board\u2019s\n(FSB\u2019s) TLAC standard.\nGSI is required to\nmaintain a minimum\nlevel of internal MREL\nand provide the Bank\nof England the right\nto exercise bail-in\ntriggers over certain\nintercompany\nregulatory capital and\nsenior debt\ninstruments issued by\nGSI. These triggers\nenable the Bank of\nEngland to write down\nsuch instruments or\nconvert such\ninstruments to equity.\nThe triggers can be\nexercised by the Bank\nof England if it\ndetermines that GSI\nhas reached the point\nof non-viability and\nthe FRB and the FDIC\nhave not objected to\nthe bail-in or if\nGroup Inc. enters\nbankruptcy or similar\nproceedings.

As a result,\nwhether or not the\nFDIC ever sought to\nrepudiate any debt\nobligations of GS Bank\nUSA, the debtholders\n(other than depositors\nat U.S. branches)\nwould be treated\ndifferently from, and\ncould receive, if\nanything,\nsubstantially less\nthan, the depositors\nat U.S. branches of GS\nBank USA .\n\nDeposit Insurance.\nDeposits at GS Bank\nUSA have the benefit\nof FDIC insurance up\nto the applicable\nlimits.

In\naddition, the FDIC\nmust recover, by\nspecial assessment,\nlosses to the FDIC\ndeposit insurance fund\nas a result of the\nFDIC\u2019s use of the\nsystemic risk\nexception to the least\ncost resolution test\nunder the FDIA.

The U.S.\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nImprovement Act of\n1991 (FDICIA) requires\nthe U.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies to\ntake \u201cprompt\ncorrective action\u201d in\nrespect of depository\ninstitutions that do\nnot meet specified\ncapital requirements.\nFDICIA establishes\nfive capital\ncategories for FDIC-\ninsured banks, such as\nGS Bank USA: well-\ncapitalized,\nadequately\ncapitalized,\nundercapitalized,\nsignificantly\nundercapitalized and\ncritically\nundercapitalized.\n\nAn institution may be\ndowngraded to, or\ndeemed to be in, a\ncapital category that\nis lower than is\nindicated by its\ncapital ratios if it\nis determined to be in\nan unsafe or unsound\ncondition or if it\nreceives an\nunsatisfactory\nexamination rating\nwith respect to\ncertain matters.\nFDICIA imposes\nprogressively more\nrestrictive\nconstraints on\noperations, management\nand capital\ndistributions, as the\ncapital category of an\ninstitution declines.\nFailure to meet the\ncapital requirements\ncould also require a\ndepository institution\nto raise capital.\nUltimately, critically\nundercapitalized\ninstitutions are\nsubject to the\nappointment of a\nreceiver or\nconservator, as\ndescribed in\n\u201cInsolvency of an IDI\nor a BHC\u201d above.\n\nThe prompt corrective\naction regulations do\nnot apply to BHCs.\nHowever, the FRB is\nauthorized to take\nappropriate action at\nthe BHC level, based\nupon the\nundercapitalized\nstatus of the BHC\u2019s\ndepository institution\nsubsidiaries. In\ncertain instances,\nrelating to an\nundercapitalized\ndepository institution\nsubsidiary, the BHC\nwould be required to\nguarantee the\nperformance of the\nundercapitalized\nsubsidiary\u2019s capital\nrestoration plan and\nmight be liable for\ncivil money damages\nfor failure to fulfill\nits commitments on\nthat guarantee.\nFurthermore, in the\nevent of the\nbankruptcy of the BHC,\nthe guarantee would\ntake priority over the\nBHC\u2019s general\nunsecured creditors,\nas described in\n\u201cSource of Strength\u201d\nabove.\n                                      \n  18    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\nVolcker Rule prohibits\n\u201cproprietary trading,\u201d\nbut permits activities\nsuch as underwriting,\nmarket making and\nrisk-mitigation\nhedging, requires an\nextensive compliance\nprogram and includes\nadditional reporting\nand record-keeping\nrequirements.\n\nIn addition, the\nVolcker Rule limits\nthe sponsorship of,\nand investment in,\n\u201ccovered funds\u201d (as\ndefined in the rule)\nby banking entities,\nincluding us. It also\nlimits certain types\nof transactions\nbetween us and our\nsponsored and advised\nfunds, similar to the\nlimitations on\ntransactions between\ndepository\ninstitutions and their\naffiliates. Covered\nfunds include our\nprivate equity funds,\ncertain of our credit\nand real estate funds,\nour hedge funds and\ncertain other\ninvestment structures.\nThe limitation on\ninvestments in covered\nfunds requires us to\nlimit our investment\nin each such fund to\n3% or less of the\nfund\u2019s net asset\nvalue, and to limit\nour aggregate\ninvestment in all such\nfunds to 3% or less of\nour Tier 1 capital.\n\nOther Restrictions.\nFHCs generally can\nengage in a broader\nrange of financial and\nrelated activities\nthan are otherwise\npermissible for BHCs\nas long as they\ncontinue to meet the\neligibility\nrequirements for FHCs.\nThe broader range of\npermissible activities\nfor FHCs includes\nunderwriting, dealing\nand making markets in\nsecurities and making\ninvestments in non-\nFHCs (merchant banking\nactivities). In\naddition, certain\nFHCs, including us,\nare permitted to\nengage in certain\ncommodities activities\nin the U.S. that may\notherwise be\nimpermissible for\nBHCs, so long as the\nassets held pursuant\nto these activities do\nnot equal 5% or more\nof their consolidated\nassets.\n\nThe FRB, however, has\nthe authority to limit\nan FHC\u2019s ability to\nconduct activities\nthat would otherwise\nbe permissible, and\nwill likely do so if\nthe FHC does not\nsatisfactorily meet\ncertain requirements\nof the FRB. For\nexample, if an FHC or\nany of its U.S.\ndepository institution\nsubsidiaries ceases to\nmaintain its status as\nwell-capitalized or\nwell-managed, the FRB\nmay impose corrective\ncapital and/or\nmanagerial\nrequirements, as well\nas additional\nlimitations or\nconditions. If the\ndeficiencies persist,\nthe FHC may be\nrequired to divest its\nU.S. depository\ninstitution\nsubsidiaries or to\ncease engaging in\nactivities other than\nthe business of\nbanking and certain\nclosely related\nactivities.\n\nIn addition, we are\nrequired to obtain\nprior FRB approval\nbefore certain\nacquisitions and\nbefore engaging in\ncertain banking and\nother financial\nactivities both within\nand outside the U.S.\n\nU.S. G-SIBs, like us,\nare also required to\ncomply with a rule\nregarding single\ncounterparty credit\nlimits, which imposes\nmore stringent\nrequirements for\ncredit exposures among\nmajor financial\ninstitutions.\n\nThe New York State\nbanking law imposes\nlending limits (which\ntake into account\ncredit exposure from\nderivative\ntransactions) and\nother requirements\nthat could impact the\nmanner and scope of GS\nBank USA\u2019s activities.\n\nThe U.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies\nhave issued guidance\nthat focuses on\ntransaction structures\nand risk management\nframeworks and that\noutlines high-level\nprinciples for safe-\nand-sound leveraged\nlending, including\nunderwriting\nstandards, valuation\nand stress testing.\nThis guidance has,\namong other things,\nlimited the percentage\namount of debt that\ncan be included in\ncertain transactions.\n\nAs a German credit\ninstitution, GSBE is\nsubject to Volcker\nRule-type prohibitions\nunder German banking\nlaw and regulations\nbecause its financial\nassets exceed certain\nthresholds.

Some\nprivacy laws offer\nindividuals certain\nrights about how their\npersonal information\nis processed, provide\nfor significant\npenalties for non-\ncompliance, and, under\ncertain circumstances,\nimpose requirements\nfor transfers of\npersonal data across\nnational borders.\nSeveral non-U.S.\njurisdictions have\nenacted, or are\nproposing, privacy and\ndata protection laws,\nincluding India, which\nenacted a privacy\nprotection law in\nAugust 2023.\n\nIn March 2023, the SEC\nproposed to amend\nRegulation S-P that\nimplements the GLB Act\nand Regulation Systems\nCompliance and\nIntegrity Regulation\n(SCI).

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur businesses are\nalso subject to laws\nand regulations\ngoverning\ncybersecurity and\nrelated risks, and\nwhich require\nregulatory\ndisclosures, and, in\nsome instances,\nindividual\ndisclosures, of\ncertain security\nincidents. These\ninclude, but are not\nlimited to, the NYDFS\nCybersecurity\nRequirements for\nFinancial Services\nCompanies. The NYDFS\nalso requires\nfinancial institutions\nregulated by the\nNYDFS, including GS\nBank USA, to, among\nother things, (i)\nestablish and maintain\na cybersecurity\nprogram designed to\nensure the\nconfidentiality,\nintegrity and\navailability of their\ninformation systems;\n(ii) implement and\nmaintain a written\ncybersecurity policy\nsetting forth policies\nand procedures for the\nprotection of their\ninformation systems\nand nonpublic\ninformation; and (iii)\ndesignate a Chief\nInformation Security\nOfficer. On November\n1, 2023, the NYDFS\nadopted amendments to\nits cybersecurity\nregulations that will\nimpose heightened or\nadditional\nrequirements with\nrespect to\ncybersecurity incident\nnotifications, risk\nmanagement and\ngovernance.\n\nIn January 2023, the\nE.U. Digital\nOperational Resilience\nAct (DORA) became\neffective and will\napply from January\n2025. DORA requires\nE.U. financial\nentities, such as\nGSBE, to have a\ncomprehensive\ngovernance and control\nframework for the\nmanagement of\ninformation and\ncommunications\ntechnology risk.\n\nIn October 2023, the\nCFPB issued a proposed\nrule regarding\npersonal financial\ndata rights that would\napply to financial\ninstitutions that\noffer consumer deposit\naccounts such as GS\nBank USA. Covered\nfinancial institutions\nwould be required to\nprovide consumers\nelectronic access to\n24 months of\ntransaction data and\ncertain account\ninformation under the\nproposed rule and\nwould be prohibited\nfrom imposing any fees\nor charges for\nmaintaining or\nproviding access to\nsuch data. The\nproposed rule would\nalso impose data\naccuracy, retention\nand other obligations.\nWe will continue to\nevaluate the proposed\nrule and the impact on\nGS Bank USA.\n\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof Operations \u2014 Risk\nManagement \u2014\nCybersecurity Risk\nManagement\u201d in Part\nII, Item 7 of this\nForm 10\u2011K for further\ninformation about our\ncybersecurity risk\nmanagement, strategy\nand governance.\n                                              \n  Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)  \n                                              \nPolicymakers,\nlawmakers and\nregulators in the U.S.\nand other\njurisdictions have\nrecently increased\ntheir focus on ESG-\nrelated risk\noversight, disclosure,\nand practices at\nfinancial institutions\nand other companies.\n\nIn October 2023, the\nfederal bank\nregulatory agencies\njointly issued\nprinciples for\nclimate-related\nfinancial risk\nmanagement for large\nfinancial\ninstitutions, which\napply to regulated\nfinancial institutions\nwith more than $100\nbillion in total\nconsolidated assets,\nincluding us. The\nprinciples are\nintended to support\nefforts by large\nfinancial institutions\nto focus on key\naspects of climate-\nrelated financial risk\nmanagement and consist\nof six general\nprinciples: (1)\ngovernance; (2)\npolicies, procedures,\nand limits; (3)\nstrategic planning;\n(4) risk management;\n(5) data, risk\nmeasurement, and\nreporting; and (6)\nscenario analysis. In\nSeptember 2023, the\nSEC adopted amendments\nto Rule 35d-1 (Names\nRule) under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940. The previous\nNames Rule generally\nrequired a fund with a\nname suggesting a\nfocus in a particular\ntype of investment, or\nin investments in a\nparticular industry or\ngeographic region, to\nadopt a policy to\ninvest at least 80% of\nthe value of its\nassets in the type of\ninvestment, or in\ninvestments in the\nindustry, country or\ngeographic region,\nsuggested by its name.\nThe amendments expand\nsuch 80% investment\npolicy to apply to any\nfund name with terms\nsuggesting that the\nfund focuses in\ninvestments that have,\nor investments whose\nissuers have,\nparticular\ncharacteristics,\nincluding names that\nsuggest the fund\nincorporates ESG\nfactors in its\ninvestment decisions.\nIn May 2022, the SEC\nproposed a rule that\nwould require enhanced\ndisclosures by certain\ninvestment advisers\nand investment\ncompanies about their\nESG investment\npractices. In March\n2022, the SEC proposed\na rule on the\nenhancement and\nstandardization of\nclimate-related\ndisclosures for\ninvestors. The\nproposal would require\npublic issuers,\nincluding Group Inc.,\nto significantly\nexpand the scope of\nclimate-related\ndisclosures in their\nSEC filings.\n\nSeveral states in\nwhich we operate have\nenacted or proposed\nstatutes, regulations\nor guidance addressing\nclimate change and\nother ESG issues. For\nexample, in December\n2022, the NYDFS\nproposed guidance on\nclimate-related\nfinancial risk\nmanagement applicable\nto NYDFS-regulated\nbanking and mortgage\norganizations,\nincluding GS Bank USA.\nThe proposed guidance\nwould address material\nfinancial risks\nrelated to climate\nchange faced by these\norganizations in the\ncontext of risk\nassessment, risk\nmanagement, and risk\nappetite setting.\n                                      \n  26    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn December 2021, the\nFCA introduced\nmandatory Taskforce on\nClimate-related\nFinancial Disclosures\n(TCFD)-aligned\ndisclosure\nrequirements for\ncertain FCA-regulated\nfirms. GSI and GSAMI\npublished their first\nTCFD entity-level\nreport for in-scope\nasset and wealth\nmanagement activity\ndue under these\nrequirements in 2023.\nWe continue to assess\nthe impact of other\nESG-related regulatory\nframeworks that will,\nor are proposed to, in\nthe future apply to\nour FCA- and/or PRA-\nregulated\nsubsidiaries,\nincluding the rules\nadopted by the FCA in\nDecember 2023 on\nsustainability\ndisclosure\nrequirements and\ninvestment labels.

Certain of\nour E.U. and non-E.U.\nentities will be\nsubject to new\nsustainability-related\nlaws being implemented\nby E.U. policymakers\nand member states. In\nparticular, beginning\nwith 2024 year-end\nreporting, we are\nsubject to extensive\ndisclosure\nrequirements of the\nCorporate\nSustainability\nReporting Directive\n(CSRD). The CSRD will\nsignificantly expand\nthe scope of ESG\ndisclosure required of\nus. In addition, the\nE.U.\u2019s proposed\nCorporate\nSustainability Due\nDiligence Directive\n(CSDDD), if and when\nadopted, may subject\ncertain of our E.U.\nand non-E.U. entities\nto additional due\ndiligence obligations\nand governance\nrequirements with\nrespect to their own\noperations and\nactivities of their\nexternal suppliers in\ntheir upstream value\nchain. Group Inc. will\nalso be required to\ndisclose its\ntransition plan by\n2030 (planned out in\nfive-year increments)\nto align its business\nstrategy with limiting\nglobal warming to\n1.5\u02daC. The CSDDD\nremains subject to\nfinalization and\nadoption by E.U.\npolicymakers, and we\nare continuing to\nevaluate its potential\nimpact.

In\naddition, concerns\nabout actual or\npotential increases in\ninterest rates,\ninflation and other\nborrowing costs, a\npublic health\nemergency, sovereign\ndebt risk and its\nimpact on the relevant\nsovereign banking\nsystem, and\nlimitations on\ninternational trade,\nhave, at times,\nnegatively impacted\nthe levels of client\nactivity.\n\nGeneral uncertainty\nabout economic,\npolitical and market\nactivities, and the\nscope, timing and\nimpact of regulatory\nreform, as well as\nweak consumer,\ninvestor and CEO\nconfidence resulting\nin large part from\nsuch uncertainty, has\nin the past negatively\nimpacted client\nactivity, which has in\nthe past adversely\naffected and could in\nthe future adversely\naffect many of our\nbusinesses. Periods of\nlow volatility and\nperiods of high\nvolatility combined\nwith a lack of\nliquidity have at\ntimes had an\nunfavorable impact on\nour market-making\nbusinesses.\n\nChanges, or proposed\nchanges, to U.S.\ninternational trade\nand investment\npolicies, particularly\nwith important trading\npartners, have in\nrecent years\nnegatively impacted\nfinancial markets.\nContinued or\nescalating tensions\nmay result in further\nactions taken by the\nU.S. or other\ncountries that could\ndisrupt international\ntrade and investment\nand adversely affect\nfinancial markets.\nThose actions could\ninclude, among others,\nthe implementation of\nsanctions, tariffs or\nforeign exchange\nmeasures, the large-\nscale sale of U.S.\nTreasury securities or\nother restrictions on\ncross-border trade,\ninvestment, or\ntransfer of\ninformation or\ntechnology. Such\ndevelopments have in\nthe past affected and\ncould in the future\nadversely affect our\nor our clients\u2019\nbusinesses.\n\nFinancial institution\nreturns may be\nnegatively impacted by\nincreased funding\ncosts due in part to\nthe lack of perceived\ngovernment support of\nsuch institutions in\nthe event of future\nfinancial crises\nrelative to financial\ninstitutions in\ncountries in which\ngovernmental support\nis maintained. In\naddition, liquidity in\nthe financial markets\nhas in the past been,\nand could in the\nfuture be, negatively\nimpacted as market\nparticipants and\nmarket practices and\nstructures adjust to\nevolving regulatory\nframeworks.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    33  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn June 2023, the U.S.\nfederal government\nsuspended the federal\ndebt limit until 2025.\nIf Congress does not\nraise the debt ceiling\nprior to 2025, the\nU.S. could default on\nits obligations,\nincluding Treasury\nsecurities that play\nan integral role in\nfinancial markets. A\ndefault by the U.S.\ncould result in\nunprecedented market\nvolatility and\nilliquidity,\nheightened operational\nrisks relating to the\nclearance and\nsettlement of\ntransactions, margin\nand other disputes\nwith clients and\ncounterparties, an\nadverse impact to\ninvestors including\nmoney market funds\nthat invest in U.S.\nTreasuries, downgrades\nin the U.S. credit\nrating, further\nincreases in interest\nrates and borrowing\ncosts and a recession\nin the U.S. or other\neconomies. Continued\nuncertainty relating\nto the debt ceiling\ncould result in\ndowngrades of the U.S.\ncredit rating, which\ncould adversely affect\nmarket conditions,\nlead to margin\ndisputes, further\nincreases in interest\nrates and borrowing\ncosts and necessitate\nsignificant\noperational changes\namong market\nparticipants,\nincluding us. A\ndowngrade of the U.S.\nfederal government\u2019s\ncredit rating could\nalso materially and\nadversely affect the\nmarket for repurchase\nagreements, securities\nborrowing and lending,\nand other financings\ntypically\ncollateralized by U.S.\nTreasury or agency\nobligations. Further,\nthe fair value,\nliquidity and credit\nratings of securities\nissued by, or other\nobligations of,\nagencies of the U.S.\ngovernment or related\nto the U.S. government\nor its agencies, as\nwell as municipal\nbonds could be\nsimilarly adversely\naffected. An\nincreasing frequency\nof government\nshutdowns, or near\nshutdowns, in the U.S.\ncould also lead to\nuncertainty as to the\ncontinued funding of\nthe U.S. government,\nwhich could, in turn,\nadversely affect the\ncredit ratings of the\nU.S. and the market\nfor U.S. Treasury or\nagency obligations.\n\nIn 2024, numerous\nelections will be held\nglobally. As a result,\nthere may be\nsignificant market\nuncertainty in the\nperiods leading up to\nand/or following the\nelections and this\ncould cause higher\nvolatility, lower\nlevels of market\nactivity and other\nadverse conditions for\nour businesses. The\noutcomes of the\nelections could also\nresult in changes in\npolicy, which could\nalso have adverse\neffects on us or the\nbusiness environment\nin which we operate\nmore generally.\n\nOur businesses have\nbeen and may in the\nfuture be adversely\naffected by declining\nasset values,\nparticularly where we\nhave net \u201clong\u201d\npositions, receive\nfees based on the\nvalue of assets\nmanaged, or receive or\npost collateral.\n\nMany of our businesses\nhave net \u201clong\u201d\npositions in debt\nsecurities, loans,\nderivatives,\nmortgages, equities\n(including private\nequity and real\nestate) and most other\nasset classes. These\ninclude positions we\ntake when we act as a\nprincipal to\nfacilitate our\nclients\u2019 activities,\nincluding our\nexchange-based market-\nmaking activities, or\ncommit large amounts\nof capital to maintain\npositions in interest\nrate and credit\nproducts, as well as\nthrough our\ncurrencies,\ncommodities, equities\nand mortgage-related\nactivities. In\naddition, we invest in\nsimilar asset classes.\nSubstantially all of\nour investing and\nmarket-making\npositions and a\nportion of our loans\nare marked-to-market\non a daily or other\nperiodic basis and\ndeclines in asset\nvalues directly and\npromptly impact our\nearnings, unless we\nhave effectively\n\u201chedged\u201d our exposures\nto those declines.\n\nIn certain\ncircumstances\n(particularly in the\ncase of credit\nproducts, including\nleveraged loans, and\nprivate equities or\nother securities that\nare not freely\ntradable or lack\nestablished and liquid\ntrading markets), it\nmay not be possible or\neconomic to hedge our\nexposures and, to the\nextent that we do so,\nthe hedge may be\nineffective or may\ngreatly reduce our\nability to profit from\nincreases in the\nvalues of the assets.\nSudden declines and\nsignificant volatility\nin the prices of\nassets have in the\npast substantially\ncurtailed or\neliminated, and may in\nthe future\nsubstantially curtail\nor eliminate, the\ntrading markets for\ncertain assets, which\nmay make it difficult\nto sell, hedge or\nvalue such assets. We\nmay incur losses from\ntime to time as\ntrading markets\ndeteriorate or cease\nto function, including\nwith respect to loan\ncommitments we have\nmade or securities\nofferings we have\nunderwritten. The\ninability to sell or\neffectively hedge\nassets reduces our\nability to limit\nlosses in such\npositions and the\ndifficulty in valuing\nassets has in the past\nnegatively affected,\nand may in the future\nnegatively affect, our\ncapital, liquidity or\nleverage ratios, our\nfunding costs and our\nability to deploy\ncapital.\n\nIn our exchange-based\nmarket-making\nactivities, we are\nobligated by stock\nexchange rules to\nmaintain an orderly\nmarket, including by\npurchasing securities\nin a declining market.\nIn markets where asset\nvalues are declining\nand in volatile\nmarkets, this results\nin losses and an\nincreased need for\nliquidity.\n\nWe receive asset-based\nmanagement fees based\non the value of our\nclients\u2019 portfolios or\ninvestment in funds\nmanaged by us and, in\nsome cases, we also\nreceive incentive fees\nbased on increases in\nthe value of such\ninvestments. Declines\nin asset values would\nordinarily reduce the\nvalue of our clients\u2019\nportfolios or fund\nassets, which in turn\nwould typically reduce\nthe fees we earn for\nmanaging such assets.\n                                      \n  34    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe post collateral to\nsupport our\nobligations and\nreceive collateral\nthat supports the\nobligations of our\nclients and\ncounterparties. When\nthe value of the\nassets posted as\ncollateral or the\ncredit ratings of the\nparty posting\ncollateral decline,\nthe party posting the\ncollateral may need to\nprovide additional\ncollateral or, if\npossible, reduce its\ntrading position. An\nexample of such a\nsituation is a \u201cmargin\ncall\u201d in connection\nwith a brokerage\naccount. Therefore,\ndeclines in the value\nof asset classes used\nas collateral mean\nthat either the cost\nof funding positions\nis increased or the\nsize of positions is\ndecreased. If we are\nthe party providing\ncollateral, this can\nincrease our costs and\nreduce our\nprofitability and if\nwe are the party\nreceiving collateral,\nthis can also reduce\nour profitability by\nreducing the level of\nbusiness done with our\nclients and\ncounterparties.\n\nIn addition, volatile\nor less liquid markets\nincrease the\ndifficulty of valuing\nassets, which can lead\nto costly and time-\nconsuming disputes\nover asset values and\nthe level of required\ncollateral, as well as\nincreased credit risk\nto the recipient of\nthe collateral due to\ndelays in receiving\nadequate collateral.\nIn cases where we\nforeclose on\ncollateral, sudden\ndeclines in the value\nor liquidity of the\ncollateral have in the\npast resulted in, and\nmay in the future\nresult in, significant\nlosses to us,\nespecially where there\nis a single type of\ncollateral supporting\nthe obligation. In\naddition, we have been\nand may in the future\nbe subject to claims\nthat the foreclosure\nwas not permitted\nunder the legal\ndocuments, was\nconducted in an\nimproper manner,\nincluding in violation\nof law, or caused a\nclient or counterparty\nto go out of business.\n\nOur market-making\nactivities have been\nand may in the future\nbe affected by changes\nin the levels of\nmarket volatility.\n\nCertain of our market-\nmaking activities\ndepend on market\nvolatility to provide\ntrading and arbitrage\nopportunities to our\nclients, and decreases\nin volatility have\nreduced and may in the\nfuture reduce these\nopportunities and the\nlevel of client\nactivity associated\nwith them and have\nadversely affected and\nmay in the future\nadversely affect the\nresults of these\nactivities. Increased\nvolatility, while it\ncan increase trading\nvolumes and spreads,\nalso increases risk as\nmeasured by Value-at-\nRisk (VaR) and\nincreases risks in\nconnection with our\nmarket-making\nactivities and can\ncause us to reduce our\ninventory. Limiting\nthe size of our\nmarket-making\npositions can\nadversely affect our\nprofitability. In\nperiods when\nvolatility is\nincreasing, but asset\nvalues are declining\nsignificantly, it may\nnot be possible to\nsell assets at all or\nit may only be\npossible to do so at\nsteep discounts. In\nthose circumstances,\nwe have been and may\nin the future be\nforced to either take\non additional risk or\nto realize losses in\norder to decrease our\nVaR. In addition,\nincreases in\nvolatility increase\nthe level of our RWAs,\nwhich increases the\namount of capital that\nwe are required to\nhold, and this can\nreduce our\nprofitability and\nreduce our ability to\ndistribute capital to\nour shareholders.\n\nOur investment\nbanking, client\nintermediation, asset\nmanagement and wealth\nmanagement businesses\nhave been adversely\naffected and may in\nthe future be\nadversely affected by\nmarket uncertainty or\nlack of confidence\namong investors and\nCEOs due to declines\nin economic activity\nand other unfavorable\neconomic, geopolitical\nor market conditions.\n\nOur investment banking\nbusiness has been and\nmay in the future be\nadversely affected by\nmarket conditions.\nPoor economic\nconditions and other\nuncertain geopolitical\nconditions may\nadversely affect and\nhave in the past\nadversely affected\ninvestor and CEO\nconfidence, resulting\nin significant\nindustry-wide declines\nin the size and number\nof underwritings and\nof advisory\ntransactions, which\nwould likely have and\nhave in the past had\nan adverse effect on\nour revenues and our\nprofit margins. In\nparticular, because a\nsignificant portion of\nour investment banking\nrevenues is derived\nfrom our participation\nin large transactions,\na decline in the\nnumber of large\ntransactions has in\nthe past and would in\nthe future adversely\naffect our investment\nbanking business.\nSimilarly, in recent\nyears, cross-border\ninitial public\nofferings and other\nsecurities offerings\nhave accounted for a\nsignificant proportion\nof new issuance\nactivity. Legislative,\nregulatory or other\nchanges that limit\ntrading in, or the\nissuance of,\nsecurities outside the\nissuers\u2019 domestic\nmarkets, that result\nin or could result in\nthe delisting or\nremoval of securities\nfrom exchanges or\nindices, have in the\npast adversely\naffected and would in\nthe future adversely\naffect our\nunderwriting and\nclient intermediation\nbusinesses.\nFurthermore, changes,\nor proposed changes,\nto international trade\nand investment\npolicies of the U.S.\nand other countries\ncould negatively\naffect market activity\nlevels and our\nrevenues.\n\nIn certain\ncircumstances, market\nuncertainty or general\ndeclines in market or\neconomic activity may\nadversely affect our\nclient intermediation\nbusinesses by\ndecreasing levels of\noverall activity or by\ndecreasing volatility.\n\nMarket uncertainty,\nvolatility and adverse\neconomic conditions,\nas well as declines in\nasset values, may\ncause our clients to\ntransfer their assets\nout of our funds or\nother products or\ntheir brokerage\naccounts and result in\nreduced net revenues,\nprincipally in our\nasset management and\nwealth management\nbusinesses. Even if\nclients do not\nwithdraw their funds,\nthey may invest them\nin products that\ngenerate less fee\nincome.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    35  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur asset management\nand wealth management\nbusinesses have been\nand may in the future\nbe adversely affected\nby the poor investment\nperformance of our\ninvestment products or\na client preference\nfor products other\nthan those which we\noffer or for products\nthat generate lower\nfees.\n\nPoor investment\nreturns in our asset\nmanagement and wealth\nmanagement businesses,\ndue to either general\nmarket conditions or\nunderperformance\n(relative to our\ncompetitors or to\nbenchmarks) by funds\nor accounts that we\nmanage or investment\nproducts that we\ndesign or sell, affect\nour ability to retain\nexisting assets and to\nattract new clients or\nadditional assets from\nexisting clients. This\ncould affect the\nmanagement and\nincentive fees that we\nearn on AUS or the\ncommissions and net\nspreads that we earn\nfor selling other\ninvestment products,\nsuch as structured\nnotes or derivatives.\nTo the extent that our\nclients choose to\ninvest in products\nthat we do not\ncurrently offer, we\nwill suffer outflows\nand a loss of\nmanagement fees.\nFurther, if, due to\nchanges in investor\nsentiment or the\nrelative performance\nof certain asset\nclasses or otherwise,\nclients continue to\ninvest in products\nthat generate lower\nfees (e.g., passively\nmanaged or fixed\nincome products), our\naverage effective\nmanagement fee will\ndecline further and\nour asset management\nand wealth management\nbusinesses could be\nadversely affected.\n\nInflation has had, and\ncould continue to\nhave, a negative\neffect on our\nbusiness, results of\noperations and\nfinancial condition.\n\nInflationary pressures\nhave affected\neconomies, financial\nmarkets and market\nparticipants\nworldwide.\nInflationary pressures\nhave increased certain\nof our operating\nexpenses, and have\nadversely affected\nconsumer sentiment and\nCEO confidence.\nCentral bank responses\nto inflationary\npressures have also\nresulted in higher\nmarket interest rates,\nwhich, in turn, have\ncontributed to lower\nactivity levels across\nfinancial markets, in\nparticular for debt\nunderwriting\ntransactions and\nmortgage originations,\nand resulted in lower\nvalues for certain\nfinancial assets which\nhave adversely\naffected our equity\nand debt investments.\nHigher interest rates\nincrease our borrowing\ncosts and have\nrequired us to\nincrease interest paid\non our deposits. If\ninflationary pressures\npersist, our expenses\nmay increase further;\nwe may be unable to\nachieve our efficiency\nratio target; activity\nlevels for certain of\nour businesses, in\nparticular debt\nunderwriting and\nmortgages, may\ndecline; our interest\nexpense could increase\nfaster than our\ninterest income,\nreducing our net\ninterest income and\nnet interest margin;\ncertain of our\ninvestments could\ncontinue to incur\nlosses or generally\nlow levels of returns;\nAUS could decline, or\nthe composition of our\nAUS could shift to\nlower fee products,\nreducing management\nand other fees;\neconomies worldwide\ncould experience\nrecessions; and we\ncould continue to\noperate in a generally\nunfavorable economic\nand market\nenvironment.\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nOur liquidity,\nprofitability and\nbusinesses may be\nadversely affected by\nan inability to access\nthe debt capital\nmarkets or to sell\nassets.\n\nLiquidity is essential\nto our businesses. It\nis of critical\nimportance to us, as\nmost of the failures\nof financial\ninstitutions have\noccurred in large part\ndue to insufficient\nliquidity. Our\nliquidity may be\nimpaired by an\ninability to access\nsecured and/or\nunsecured debt\nmarkets, an inability\nto raise or retain\ndeposits, an inability\nto access funds from\nour subsidiaries or\notherwise allocate\nliquidity optimally,\nan inability to sell\nassets or redeem our\ninvestments, lack of\ntimely settlement of\ntransactions, unusual\ndeposit outflows, or\nother unforeseen\noutflows of cash or\ncollateral, such as in\nMarch 2020, when\ncorporate clients drew\non revolving credit\nfacilities in response\nto the COVID-19\npandemic. This\nsituation may arise\ndue to circumstances\nthat we may be unable\nto control, such as a\ngeneral market or\neconomic disruption or\nan operational problem\nthat affects third\nparties or us, or even\nby the perception\namong market\nparticipants that we,\nor other market\nparticipants, are\nexperiencing greater\nliquidity risk.\n\nWe employ structured\nproducts to benefit\nour clients and hedge\nour own risks. The\nfinancial instruments\nthat we hold and the\ncontracts to which we\nare a party are often\ncomplex, and these\ncomplex structured\nproducts often do not\nhave readily available\nmarkets to access in\ntimes of liquidity\nstress. Our investing\nand financing\nactivities may lead to\nsituations where the\nholdings from these\nactivities represent a\nsignificant portion of\nspecific markets,\nwhich could restrict\nliquidity for our\npositions.\n\nFurther, our ability\nto sell assets may be\nimpaired if there is\nnot generally a liquid\nmarket for such\nassets, as well as in\ncircumstances where\nother market\nparticipants are\nseeking to sell\nsimilar otherwise\ngenerally liquid\nassets at the same\ntime, as is likely to\noccur in a liquidity\nor other market crisis\nor in response to\nchanges to rules or\nregulations. For\nexample, in 2021, an\ninvestment management\nfirm with large\npositions with several\nfinancial institutions\ndefaulted, resulting\nin rapidly declining\nprices in the\nsecurities underlying\nthose positions. In\naddition,\nclearinghouses,\nexchanges and other\nfinancial institutions\nwith which we interact\nmay exercise set-off\nrights or the right to\nrequire additional\ncollateral, including\nin difficult market\nconditions, which\ncould further impair\nour liquidity.\n\nNumerous regulations\nhave been adopted that\nimpose more stringent\nliquidity requirements\non large financial\ninstitutions,\nincluding us. These\nregulations require us\nto hold large amounts\nof highly liquid\nassets and reduce our\nflexibility to source\nand deploy funding. In\naddition, our need to\nmanage our operations\nin light of certain\nregulatory\nrequirements when\napplicable thresholds\nare met has in the\npast limited and may\nin the future limit\nour ability to raise\ndeposits in GSIB or\nother funding, which\ncould adversely affect\nour liquidity or\nability to respond\nefficiently to\nliquidity stress.\n                                      \n  36    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur businesses have\nbeen and may in the\nfuture be adversely\naffected by\ndisruptions or lack of\nliquidity in the\ncredit markets,\nincluding reduced\naccess to credit and\nhigher costs of\nobtaining credit.\n\nWidening credit\nspreads, as well as\nsignificant declines\nin the availability of\ncredit, have in the\npast adversely\naffected our ability\nto borrow on a secured\nand unsecured basis\nand may do so in the\nfuture. We fund\nourselves on an\nunsecured basis by\nissuing long-term debt\nand commercial paper,\nby raising deposits at\nour bank subsidiaries,\nby issuing hybrid\nfinancial instruments\nand by obtaining loans\nor lines of credit\nfrom commercial or\nother banking\nentities. We seek to\nfinance many of our\nassets on a secured\nbasis. Any disruptions\nin the credit markets\nmay make it harder and\nmore expensive to\nobtain funding for our\nbusinesses. If our\navailable funding is\nlimited or we are\nforced to fund our\noperations at a higher\ncost, these conditions\nmay require us to\ncurtail our business\nactivities and\nincrease our cost of\nfunding, both of which\ncould reduce our\nprofitability,\nparticularly in our\nbusinesses that\ninvolve investing,\nlending and market\nmaking.\n\nOur clients engaging\nin mergers,\nacquisitions and other\ntypes of strategic\ntransactions often\nrely on access to the\nsecured and unsecured\ncredit markets to\nfinance their\ntransactions. A lack\nof available credit or\nan increased cost of\ncredit can adversely\naffect the size,\nvolume and timing of\nour clients\u2019 merger\nand acquisition\ntransactions,\nparticularly large\ntransactions, and\nadversely affect our\nadvisory and\nunderwriting\nbusinesses.\n\nOur credit businesses\nhave been and may in\nthe future be\nnegatively affected by\na lack of liquidity in\ncredit markets. A lack\nof liquidity reduces\nprice transparency,\nincreases price\nvolatility and\ndecreases transaction\nvolumes and size, all\nof which can increase\ntransaction risk or\ndecrease the\nprofitability of these\nbusinesses.\n\nReductions in our\ncredit ratings or an\nincrease in our credit\nspreads may adversely\naffect our liquidity\nand cost of funding.\n\nOur credit ratings are\nimportant to our\nliquidity. A reduction\nin our credit ratings\ncould adversely affect\nour liquidity and\ncompetitive position,\nincrease our borrowing\ncosts, limit our\naccess to the capital\nmarkets or trigger our\nobligations under\ncertain provisions in\nsome of our trading\nand collateralized\nfinancing contracts.\nUnder these\nprovisions,\ncounterparties could\nbe permitted to\nterminate contracts\nwith us or require us\nto post additional\ncollateral.\nTermination of our\ntrading and\ncollateralized\nfinancing contracts\ncould cause us to\nsustain losses and\nimpair our liquidity\nby requiring us to\nfind other sources of\nfinancing or to make\nsignificant cash\npayments or securities\nmovements.\n\nAs of December 2023,\nour counterparties\ncould have called for\nadditional collateral\nor termination\npayments related to\nour net derivative\nliabilities under\nbilateral agreements\nin an aggregate amount\nof $271 million in the\nevent of a one-notch\ndowngrade of our\ncredit ratings and\n$1.58 billion in the\nevent of a two-notch\ndowngrade of our\ncredit ratings. A\ndowngrade by any one\nrating agency,\ndepending on the\nagency\u2019s relative\nratings of us at the\ntime of the downgrade,\nmay have an impact\nwhich is comparable to\nthe impact of a\ndowngrade by all\nrating agencies.

Changes in\ncredit spreads are\ncontinuous, market-\ndriven, and subject at\ntimes to unpredictable\nand highly volatile\nmovements. Our credit\nspreads are also\ninfluenced by market\nperceptions of our\ncreditworthiness and\nmovements in the costs\nto purchasers of\ncredit default swaps\nreferenced to our\nlong-term debt. The\nmarket for credit\ndefault swaps has\nproven to be extremely\nvolatile and at times\nhas lacked a high\ndegree of transparency\nor liquidity.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    37  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Many of\nour subsidiaries,\nincluding our broker-\ndealer and bank\nsubsidiaries, are\nsubject to laws that\nrestrict dividend\npayments or authorize\nregulatory bodies to\nblock or reduce the\nflow of funds from\nthose subsidiaries to\nGroup Inc.\n\nIn addition, our\nbroker-dealer and bank\nentities and their\nsubsidiaries are\nsubject to\nrestrictions on their\nability to lend or\ntransact with\naffiliates and to\nminimum regulatory\ncapital and other\nrequirements, as well\nas restrictions on\ntheir ability to use\nfunds deposited with\nthem in brokerage or\nbank accounts to fund\ntheir businesses.\nAdditional\nrestrictions on\nrelated-party\ntransactions,\nincreased capital and\nliquidity requirements\nand additional\nlimitations on the use\nof funds on deposit in\nbank or brokerage\naccounts, as well as\nlower earnings, can\nreduce the amount of\nfunds available to\nmeet the obligations\nof Group Inc.,\nincluding under the\nFRB\u2019s source of\nstrength requirement,\nand even require Group\nInc. to provide\nadditional funding to\nsuch subsidiaries.\nRestrictions or\nregulatory action of\nthat kind could impede\naccess to funds that\nGroup Inc. needs to\nmake payments on its\nobligations, including\ndebt obligations, or\ndividend payments. In\naddition, Group Inc.\u2019s\nright to participate\nin a distribution of\nassets upon a\nsubsidiary\u2019s\nliquidation or\nreorganization is\nsubject to the prior\nclaims of the\nsubsidiary\u2019s\ncreditors.\n\nThere has been a trend\ntowards increased\nregulation and\nsupervision of our\nsubsidiaries by the\ngovernments and\nregulators in the\ncountries in which\nthose subsidiaries are\nlocated or do\nbusiness. Concerns\nabout protecting\nclients and creditors\nof financial\ninstitutions that are\ncontrolled by persons\nor entities located\noutside of the country\nin which such entities\nare located or do\nbusiness have caused\nor may cause a number\nof governments and\nregulators to take\nadditional steps to\n\u201cring fence\u201d or\nrequire internal total\nloss-absorbing\ncapacity (which may\nalso be subject to\n\u201cbail-in\u201d powers, as\ndescribed below) at\nthose entities in\norder to protect\nclients and creditors\nof those entities in\nthe event of financial\ndifficulties involving\nthose entities. The\nresult has been and\nmay continue to be\nadditional limitations\non our ability to\nefficiently move\ncapital and liquidity\namong our affiliated\nentities, or to Group\nInc., including in\ntimes of stress,\nthereby increasing the\noverall level of\ncapital and liquidity\nrequired by us on a\nconsolidated basis.\n\nFurthermore, Group\nInc. has guaranteed\nthe payment\nobligations of certain\nof its subsidiaries,\nincluding GS&Co. and\nGS Bank USA, subject\nto certain exceptions.\nIn addition, Group\nInc. guarantees many\nof the obligations of\nits other consolidated\nsubsidiaries on a\ntransaction-by-\ntransaction basis, as\nnegotiated with\ncounterparties. These\nguarantees may require\nGroup Inc. to provide\nsubstantial funds or\nassets to its\nsubsidiaries or their\ncreditors or\ncounterparties at a\ntime when Group Inc.\nis in need of\nliquidity to fund its\nown obligations.\n\nThe requirements for\nus and certain of our\nsubsidiaries to\ndevelop and submit\nrecovery and\nresolution plans to\nregulators, and the\nincorporation of\nfeedback received from\nregulators, may\nrequire us to increase\ncapital or liquidity\nlevels or issue\nadditional long-term\ndebt at Group Inc. or\nparticular\nsubsidiaries or\notherwise incur\nadditional or\nduplicative\noperational or other\ncosts at multiple\nentities, and may\nreduce our ability to\nprovide Group Inc.\nguarantees of the\nobligations of our\nsubsidiaries or raise\ndebt at Group Inc.\nResolution planning\nmay also impair our\nability to structure\nour intercompany and\nexternal activities in\na manner that we may\notherwise deem most\noperationally\nefficient.\nFurthermore,\narrangements to\nfacilitate our\nresolution planning\nmay cause us to be\nsubject to additional\ntaxes.

In\naddition,\ndeterioration in the\ncredit quality of\nthird parties whose\nsecurities or\nobligations we hold,\nincluding a\ndeterioration in the\nvalue of collateral\nposted by third\nparties to secure\ntheir obligations to\nus under derivative\ncontracts and loan\nagreements, could\nresult in losses\nand/or adversely\naffect our ability to\nrehypothecate or\notherwise use those\nsecurities or\nobligations for\nliquidity purposes.\n\nA significant\ndowngrade in the\ncredit ratings of our\ncounterparties could\nalso have a negative\nimpact on our results.\nWhile in many cases we\nare permitted to\nrequire additional\ncollateral from\ncounterparties that\nexperience financial\ndifficulty, disputes\nmay arise as to the\namount of collateral\nwe are entitled to\nreceive and the value\nof pledged assets. The\ntermination of\ncontracts and the\nforeclosure on\ncollateral may subject\nus to claims for the\nimproper exercise of\nour rights. Default\nrates, downgrades and\ndisputes with\ncounterparties as to\nthe valuation of\ncollateral typically\nincrease significantly\nin times of market\nstress, increased\nvolatility and\nilliquidity.\n\nAs part of our\nclearing and prime\nfinancing activities,\nwe finance our\nclients\u2019 positions,\nand we could be held\nresponsible for the\ndefaults or misconduct\nof our clients.\nDefault risk may arise\nfrom events or\ncircumstances that are\ndifficult to detect or\nforesee.\n\nConcentration of risk\nincreases the\npotential for\nsignificant losses in\nour market-making,\nunderwriting,\ninvesting and\nfinancing activities.\n\nConcentration of risk\nincreases the\npotential for\nsignificant losses in\nour market-making,\nunderwriting,\ninvesting and\nfinancing activities.\nThe number and size of\nthese transactions has\naffected and may in\nthe future affect our\nresults of operations\nin a given period.\nMoreover, because of\nconcentrated risk, we\nmay suffer losses even\nwhen economic and\nmarket conditions are\ngenerally favorable\nfor our competitors.\nDisruptions in the\ncredit markets can\nmake it difficult to\nhedge these credit\nexposures effectively\nor economically. In\naddition, we extend\nlarge commitments as\npart of our credit\norigination\nactivities.\nDisruptions in the\ncredit markets have in\nthe past substantially\ncurtailed or\neliminated, and may in\nthe future\nsubstantially curtail\nor eliminate, the\ntrading markets for\nloans we originate.\nThese disruptions have\nin the past made, and\nmay in the future\nmake, it difficult for\nus to sell or value\nsuch assets, which\nhave in the past\nresulted, and may in\nthe future result, in\nlosses for us.\n\nRules adopted under\nthe Dodd-Frank Act,\nand similar rules\nadopted in other\njurisdictions, require\nissuers of certain\nasset-backed\nsecurities and any\nperson who organizes\nand initiates certain\nasset-backed\nsecurities\ntransactions to retain\neconomic exposure to\nthe asset, which has\naffected the cost of\nand structures used in\nconnection with these\nsecuritization\nactivities. Our\ninability to reduce\nour credit risk by\nselling, syndicating\nor securitizing these\npositions, including\nduring periods of\nmarket stress, has in\nthe past negatively\naffected and may in\nthe future negatively\naffect our results of\noperations due to a\ndecrease in the fair\nvalue of the\npositions, including\ndue to the insolvency\nor bankruptcy of\nborrowers, as well as\nthe loss of revenues\nassociated with\nselling such\nsecurities or loans.\n\nIn the ordinary course\nof business, we are at\ntimes subject to a\nconcentration of\ncredit risk to a\nparticular\ncounterparty,\nborrower, issuer\n(including sovereign\nissuers) or geographic\narea or group of\nrelated countries,\nsuch as the E.U., and\na failure or downgrade\nof, or default by,\nsuch entity could\nnegatively impact our\nbusinesses, perhaps\nmaterially, and the\nsystems by which we\nset limits and monitor\nthe level of our\ncredit exposure to\nindividual entities,\nindustries, countries\nand regions may not\nfunction as we have\nanticipated.\nRegulatory reform,\nincluding the Dodd-\nFrank Act, has led to\nincreased\ncentralization of\ntrading activity\nthrough particular\nclearinghouses,\ncentral agents or\nexchanges, which has\nsignificantly\nincreased our\nconcentration of risk\nwith respect to these\nentities. While our\nactivities expose us\nto many different\nindustries,\ncounterparties and\ncountries, we\nroutinely execute a\nhigh volume of\ntransactions with\ncounterparties engaged\nin financial services\nactivities, including\nbrokers and dealers,\ncommercial banks,\nclearinghouses,\nexchanges and\ninvestment funds. This\nhas resulted in\nsignificant credit\nconcentration with\nrespect to these\ncounterparties.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    39  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDerivative\ntransactions and\ndelayed documentation\nor settlements may\nexpose us to credit\nrisk, unexpected risks\nand potential losses.\n\nWe are party to a\nlarge number of\nderivative\ntransactions,\nincluding credit\nderivatives. Many of\nthese derivative\ninstruments are\nindividually\nnegotiated and non-\nstandardized, which\ncan make exiting,\ntransferring or\nsettling positions\ndifficult. Many credit\nderivatives require\nthat we deliver to the\ncounterparty the\nunderlying security,\nloan or other\nobligation in order to\nreceive payment. In a\nnumber of cases, we do\nnot hold the\nunderlying security,\nloan or other\nobligation and may not\nbe able to obtain the\nunderlying security,\nloan or other\nobligation. This could\ncause us to forfeit\nthe payments due to us\nunder these contracts\nor result in\nsettlement delays with\nthe attendant credit\nand operational risk,\nas well as increased\ncosts to us.\n\nDerivative\ntransactions also\ninvolve the risk that\ndocumentation has not\nbeen properly\nexecuted, that\nexecuted agreements\nmay not be enforceable\nagainst the\ncounterparty, or that\nobligations under such\nagreements may not be\nable to be \u201cnetted\u201d\nagainst other\nobligations with such\ncounterparty. In\naddition,\ncounterparties may\nclaim that such\ntransactions were not\nappropriate or\nauthorized.\n\nAs a signatory to the\nISDA Universal\nProtocol or U.S. ISDA\nProtocol (ISDA\nProtocols) and being\nsubject to the FRB\u2019s\nand FDIC\u2019s rules on\nQFCs and similar rules\nin other\njurisdictions, we may\nnot be able to\nexercise remedies\nagainst counterparties\nand, as this regime\nhas not yet been\ntested, we may suffer\nrisks or losses that\nwe would not have\nexpected to suffer if\nwe could immediately\nclose out transactions\nupon a termination\nevent. The ISDA\nProtocols and these\nrules and regulations\nextend to repurchase\nagreements and other\ninstruments that are\nnot derivative\ncontracts.\n\nDerivative contracts\nand other\ntransactions,\nincluding secondary\nbank loan purchases\nand sales, entered\ninto with third\nparties are not always\nconfirmed by the\ncounterparties or\nsettled on a timely\nbasis. While the\ntransaction remains\nunconfirmed or during\nany delay in\nsettlement, we are\nsubject to heightened\ncredit and operational\nrisk and in the event\nof a default may find\nit more difficult to\nenforce our rights.\n\nIn addition, as new\ncomplex derivative\nproducts are created,\ncovering a wider array\nof underlying credit\nand other instruments,\ndisputes about the\nterms of the\nunderlying contracts\ncould arise, which\ncould impair our\nability to effectively\nmanage our risk\nexposures from these\nproducts and subject\nus to increased costs.\nThe provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act\nrequiring central\nclearing of credit\nderivatives and other\nOTC derivatives, or a\nmarket shift toward\nstandardized\nderivatives, could\nreduce the risk\nassociated with these\ntransactions, but\nunder certain\ncircumstances could\nalso limit our ability\nto develop derivatives\nthat best suit the\nneeds of our clients\nand to hedge our own\nrisks, and could\nadversely affect our\nprofitability. In\naddition, these\nprovisions have\nincreased our credit\nexposure to central\nclearing platforms.\n                                              \n  Operational                                 \n                                              \nA failure in our\noperational systems or\nhuman error,\nmalfeasance or other\nmisconduct, could\nimpair our liquidity,\ndisrupt our\nbusinesses, result in\nthe disclosure of\nconfidential\ninformation, damage\nour reputation and\ncause losses.\n\nOur businesses are\nhighly dependent on\nour ability to process\nand monitor, on a\ndaily basis, a very\nlarge number of\ntransactions, many of\nwhich are highly\ncomplex and occur at\nhigh volumes and\nfrequencies, across\nnumerous and diverse\nmarkets in many\ncurrencies. These\ntransactions, as well\nas the information\ntechnology services we\nprovide to clients,\noften must adhere to\nclient-specific\nguidelines, as well as\nlegal and regulatory\nstandards.\n\nMany rules and\nregulations worldwide\ngovern our obligations\nto execute\ntransactions and\nreport such\ntransactions and other\ninformation to\nregulators, exchanges\nand investors.\nCompliance with these\nlegal and reporting\nrequirements can be\nchallenging, and we\nhave been and may in\nthe future be subject\nto regulatory fines\nand penalties for\nfailing to follow\nthese rules or to\nreport timely,\naccurate and complete\ninformation in\naccordance with these\nrules.\n\nAs the volume, speed,\nfrequency and\ncomplexity of\ntransactions,\nespecially electronic\ntransactions (as well\nas the requirements to\nreport such\ntransactions on a\nreal-time basis to\nclients, regulators\nand exchanges)\nincrease, developing\nand maintaining our\noperational systems\nand infrastructure has\nbecome more\nchallenging, and the\nrisk of systems or\nhuman error in\nconnection with such\ntransactions has\nincreased, as have the\npotential consequences\nof such errors due to\nthe speed and volume\nof transactions\ninvolved and the\npotential difficulty\nassociated with\ndiscovering errors\nquickly enough to\nlimit the resulting\nconsequences. For\nexample, the\ntransition to a T+1\nsettlement timeframe\nin the U.S. in 2024\nsubjects us to\nincreased operational\nrisks with respect to\nreporting and timely\nsettlement of\ntransactions. These\nrisks are exacerbated\nin times of increased\nvolatility. As with\nother similarly\nsituated institutions,\nwe utilize credit\nunderwriting models in\nconnection with our\nbusinesses, including\nour consumer-oriented\nactivities.\nAllegations or\npublicity, whether or\nnot accurate, that our\nunderwriting decisions\ndo not treat consumers\nor clients fairly, or\ncomply with the\napplicable law or\nregulation, have in\nthe past resulted and\nmay in the future\nresult in negative\npublicity,\nreputational damage\nand governmental and\nregulatory scrutiny,\ninvestigations and\nenforcement actions.\n                                      \n  40    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Enhancements and\nupdates to systems, as\nwell as the requisite\ntraining, including in\nconnection with the\nintegration of new\nbusinesses, entail\nsignificant costs and\ncreate risks\nassociated with\nimplementing new\nsystems and\nintegrating them with\nexisting ones.\n\nThe use of computing\ndevices and phones is\ncritical to the work\ndone by our employees\nand the operation of\nour systems and\nbusinesses and those\nof our clients and our\nthird-party service\nproviders and vendors.\nTheir importance has\ncontinued to increase,\nin particular in light\nof hybrid work\narrangements.\nComputers and computer\nnetworks are subject\nto various risks,\nincluding, among\nothers, cyber attacks,\ninherent technological\ndefects, system\nfailures and human\nerror. For example,\nfundamental security\nflaws in computer\nchips found in many\ntypes of these\ncomputing devices and\nphones have been\nreported in the past\nand may occur in the\nfuture. The use of\npersonal devices by\nour employees or by\nour vendors for work-\nrelated activities\nalso presents risks\nrelated to potential\nviolations of record\nretention and other\nrequirements. Cloud\ntechnologies are also\ncritical to the\noperation of our\nsystems and platforms\nand our reliance on\ncloud technologies is\ngrowing.

There have\nbeen a number of\nwidely publicized\ncases of outages in\nconnection with access\nto cloud computing\nproviders. Addressing\nthese and similar\nissues could be costly\nand affect the\nperformance of these\nbusinesses and\nsystems. Operational\nrisks may be incurred\nin applying fixes and\nthere may still be\nresidual security\nrisks.\n\nNotwithstanding the\nproliferation of\ntechnology and\ntechnology-based risk\nand control systems,\nour businesses\nultimately rely on\npeople as our greatest\nresource, and, from\ntime to time, they\nhave in the past and\nmay in the future make\nmistakes or engage in\nviolations of\napplicable policies,\nlaws, rules or\nprocedures that are\nnot always caught\nimmediately by our\ntechnological\nprocesses or by our\ncontrols and other\nprocedures, which are\nintended to prevent\nand detect such errors\nor violations. These\nhave in the past and\nmay in the future\ninclude calculation\nerrors, mistakes in\naddressing emails,\nerrors in software or\nmodel development or\nimplementation, or\nsimple errors in\njudgment, as well as\nintentional efforts to\nignore or circumvent\napplicable policies,\nlaws, rules or\nprocedures. Human\nerrors, malfeasance\nand other misconduct,\nincluding the\nintentional misuse of\nclient information in\nconnection with\ninsider trading or for\nother purposes, even\nif promptly discovered\nand remediated, has in\nthe past resulted and\nmay in the future\nresult in reputational\ndamage and losses and\nliabilities for us.\n\nThe majority of the\nemployees in our\nprimary locations,\nincluding the New York\nmetropolitan area,\nLondon, Bengaluru,\nHyderabad, Hong Kong,\nTokyo, Salt Lake City\nand Dallas, work in\nclose proximity to one\nanother.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe development and\nuse of artificial\nintelligence (AI)\npresent risks and\nchallenges that may\nadversely impact our\nbusiness.\n\nWe or our third-party\nvendors, clients or\ncounterparties may\ndevelop or incorporate\nAI technology in\ncertain business\nprocesses, services or\nproducts. The\ndevelopment and use of\nAI present a number of\nrisks and challenges\nto our business. The\nlegal and regulatory\nenvironment relating\nto AI is uncertain and\nrapidly evolving, both\nin the U.S. and\ninternationally, and\nincludes regulation\ntargeted specifically\nat AI as well as\nprovisions in\nintellectual property,\nprivacy, consumer\nprotection, employment\nand other laws\napplicable to the use\nof AI. These evolving\nlaws and regulations\ncould require changes\nin our implementation\nof AI technology and\nincrease our\ncompliance costs and\nthe risk of non-\ncompliance. AI models,\nparticularly\ngenerative AI models,\nmay produce output or\ntake action that is\nincorrect, that result\nin the release of\nprivate, confidential\nor proprietary\ninformation, that\nreflect biases\nincluded in the data\non which they are\ntrained, infringe on\nthe intellectual\nproperty rights of\nothers, or that is\notherwise harmful. In\naddition, the\ncomplexity of many AI\nmodels makes it\nchallenging to\nunderstand why they\nare generating\nparticular outputs.\nThis limited\ntransparency increases\nthe challenges\nassociated with\nassessing the proper\noperation of AI\nmodels, understanding\nand monitoring the\ncapabilities of the AI\nmodels, reducing\nerroneous output,\neliminating bias and\ncomplying with\nregulations that\nrequire documentation\nor explanation of the\nbasis on which\ndecisions are made.\nFurther, we may rely\non AI models developed\nby third parties, and,\nto that extent, would\nbe dependent in part\non the manner in which\nthose third parties\ndevelop and train\ntheir models,\nincluding risks\narising from the\ninclusion of any\nunauthorized material\nin the training data\nfor their models, and\nthe effectiveness of\nthe steps these third\nparties have taken to\nlimit the risks\nassociated with the\noutput of their\nmodels, matters over\nwhich we may have\nlimited visibility.\nAny of these risks\ncould expose us to\nliability or adverse\nlegal or regulatory\nconsequences and harm\nour reputation and the\npublic perception of\nour business or the\neffectiveness of our\nsecurity measures.\n\nIn addition to our use\nof AI technologies, we\nare exposed to risks\narising from the use\nof AI technologies by\nbad actors to commit\nfraud and\nmisappropriate funds\nand to facilitate\ncyberattacks.\nGenerative AI, if used\nto perpetrate fraud or\nlaunch cyberattacks,\ncould result in\nlosses, liquidity\noutflows or other\nadverse effects at a\nparticular financial\ninstitution or\nexchange.\n\nA failure to protect\nour computer systems,\nnetworks and\ninformation, and our\nclients\u2019 information,\nagainst cyber attacks\nand similar threats\ncould impair our\nability to conduct our\nbusinesses, result in\nthe disclosure, theft\nor destruction of\nconfidential\ninformation, damage\nour reputation and\ncause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on\nthe secure processing,\nstorage and\ntransmission of\nconfidential and other\ninformation in our\ncomputer systems and\nnetworks and those of\nour vendors. There\nhave been a number of\nhighly publicized\ncases involving\nfinancial services\ncompanies, consumer-\nbased companies,\nsoftware and\ninformation technology\nservice providers,\ngovernmental agencies\nand other\norganizations\nreporting the\nunauthorized access or\ndisclosure of client,\ncustomer or other\nconfidential\ninformation in recent\nyears, as well as\ncyber attacks\ninvolving the\ndissemination, theft\nand destruction of\ncorporate information\nor other assets, as a\nresult of inadequate\nprocedures or the\nfailure to follow\nprocedures by\nemployees or\ncontractors or as a\nresult of actions by\nthird parties,\nincluding actions by\nforeign governments.\nThere have also been a\nnumber of highly\npublicized cases where\nhackers have requested\n\u201cransom\u201d payments in\nexchange for not\ndisclosing customer\ninformation or for\nrestoring access to\ninformation or\nsystems.\n\nWe are regularly the\ntarget of attempted\ncyber attacks,\nincluding denial-of-\nservice attacks, and\nmust continuously\nmonitor and develop\nour systems to protect\nthe integrity and\nfunctionality of our\ntechnology\ninfrastructure and\naccess to and the\nsecurity of our data.\nWe have faced a high\nvolume of cyber\nattacks as we expand\nour mobile- and other\ninternet-based\nproducts and services,\nas well as our usage\nof mobile and cloud\ntechnologies, and as\nwe provide these\nservices to individual\nconsumers. Further,\nthe use of AI by\ncybercriminals may\nincrease the frequency\nand severity of\ncybersecurity attacks\nagainst us or our\nthird-party vendors\nand clients. The\nmigration of our\ncommunication from\ndevices we provide to\nemployee-owned devices\npresents additional\nrisks of cyber\nattacks, as do hybrid\nwork arrangements. In\naddition, due to our\ninterconnectivity with\nthird-party vendors\n(and their respective\nservice providers),\ncentral agents,\nexchanges,\nclearinghouses and\nother financial\ninstitutions, we could\nbe adversely impacted\nif any of them is\nsubject to a\nsuccessful cyber\nattack or other\ninformation security\nevent.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDespite our efforts to\nensure the integrity\nof our systems and\ninformation, we may\nnot be able to\nanticipate, detect or\nimplement effective\npreventive measures\nagainst all cyber\nthreats, including\nbecause the techniques\nused are increasingly\nsophisticated, change\nfrequently and are\noften not recognized\nuntil launched. Cyber\nattacks can originate\nfrom a variety of\nsources, including\nthird parties who are\naffiliated with or\nsponsored by foreign\ngovernments or are\ninvolved with\norganized crime or\nterrorist\norganizations. Third\nparties may also\nattempt to place\nindividuals in our\noffices or induce\nemployees, clients or\nother users of our\nsystems to disclose\nsensitive information\nor provide access to\nour data or that of\nour clients, and these\ntypes of risks may be\ndifficult to detect or\nprevent.\n\nAlthough we take\nprotective measures\nproactively and\nendeavor to modify\nthem as circumstances\nwarrant, our computer\nsystems, software and\nnetworks may be\nvulnerable to\nunauthorized access,\nmisuse, computer\nviruses or other\nmalicious code, cyber\nattacks on our vendors\nand other events that\ncould have a security\nimpact. Risks relating\nto cyber attacks on\nour vendors have been\nincreasing given the\ngreater frequency and\nseverity in recent\nyears of supply chain\nattacks affecting\nsoftware and\ninformation technology\nservice providers. Due\nto the complexity and\ninterconnectedness of\nour systems, the\nprocess of enhancing\nour protective\nmeasures can itself\ncreate a risk of\nsystems disruptions\nand security issues.\nIn addition,\nprotective measures\nthat we employ to\ncompartmentalize our\ndata may reduce our\nvisibility into, and\nadversely affect our\nability to respond to,\ncyber threats and\nissues with our\nsystems.\n\nIf one or more of\nthese types of events\noccur, it potentially\ncould jeopardize our,\nour clients\u2019, our\ncounterparties\u2019 or\nthird parties\u2019\nconfidential and other\ninformation processed,\nstored in, or\ntransmitted through\nour computer systems\nand networks, or\notherwise cause\ninterruptions or\nmalfunctions in our\noperations or those of\nour clients,\ncounterparties or\nthird parties, which\ncould impact their\nability to transact\nwith us or otherwise\nresult in legal or\nregulatory action,\nsignificant losses or\nreputational damage.\nIn addition, such an\nevent could persist\nfor an extended period\nof time before being\nproperly detected or\nescalated, and,\nfollowing detection or\nescalation, it could\ntake considerable time\nfor us to obtain full\nand reliable\ninformation about the\nextent, amount and\ntype of information\ncompromised. During\nthe course of an\ninvestigation, we may\nnot know the full\nimpact of the event\nand how to remediate\nit, and actions,\ndecisions and mistakes\nthat are taken or made\nmay further increase\nthe negative effects\nof the event on our\nbusiness, results of\noperations and\nreputation. Moreover,\nnew regulations\nrequire us to disclose\ninformation on a\ntimely basis about\nmaterial cybersecurity\nincidents, including\nthose that may not\nhave been resolved or\nfully investigated at\nthe time of\ndisclosure.\n\nWe have expended, and\nexpect to continue to\nexpend, significant\nresources on an\nongoing basis to\nmodify our protective\nmeasures and to\ninvestigate and\nremediate\nvulnerabilities or\nother exposures, but\nthese measures may be\nineffective and we may\nbe subject to legal or\nregulatory action, as\nwell as financial\nlosses that are either\nnot insured against or\nnot fully covered\nthrough any insurance\nmaintained by us.\nRegulatory agencies\nhave become\nincreasingly focused\non cybersecurity\nincidents.\n\nOur clients\u2019\nconfidential\ninformation may also\nbe at risk from the\ncompromise of clients\u2019\npersonal electronic\ndevices or as a result\nof a data security\nbreach at an unrelated\ncompany. Losses due to\nunauthorized account\nactivity could harm\nour reputation and may\nhave adverse effects\non our business,\nfinancial condition\nand results of\noperations.\n\nThe increased use of\nmobile and cloud\ntechnologies heightens\nthese and other\noperational risks, as\ndo hybrid work\narrangements. Certain\naspects of the\nsecurity of these\ntechnologies are\nunpredictable or\nbeyond our control,\nand the failure by\nmobile technology and\ncloud service\nproviders to\nadequately safeguard\ntheir systems and\nprevent cyber attacks\ncould disrupt our\noperations and result\nin misappropriation,\ncorruption or loss of\nconfidential and other\ninformation. In\naddition, there is a\nrisk that encryption\nand other protective\nmeasures, despite\ntheir sophistication,\nmay be defeated,\nparticularly to the\nextent that new\ncomputing technologies\nvastly increase the\nspeed and computing\npower available.\n\nWe routinely transmit\nand receive personal,\nconfidential and\nproprietary\ninformation by email\nand other electronic\nmeans. We have\ndiscussed and worked\nwith clients, vendors,\nservice providers,\ncounterparties and\nother third parties to\ndevelop secure\ntransmission\ncapabilities and\nprotect against cyber\nattacks, but we do not\nhave, and may be\nunable to put in\nplace, secure\ncapabilities with all\nof our clients,\nvendors, service\nproviders,\ncounterparties and\nother third parties\nand we may not be able\nto ensure that these\nthird parties have\nappropriate controls\nin place to protect\nthe confidentiality of\nthe information. An\ninterception, misuse\nor mishandling of\npersonal, confidential\nor proprietary\ninformation being sent\nto or received from a\nclient, vendor,\nservice provider,\ncounterparty or other\nthird party could\nresult in legal\nliability, regulatory\naction and\nreputational harm.\n                                      \n  44    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Our risk\nmanagement process\nseeks to balance our\nability to profit from\nmarket-making,\ninvesting or lending\npositions, and\nunderwriting\nactivities, with our\nexposure to potential\nlosses. While we\nemploy a broad and\ndiversified set of\nrisk monitoring and\nrisk mitigation\ntechniques, those\ntechniques and the\njudgments that\naccompany their\napplication cannot\nanticipate every\neconomic and financial\noutcome or the\nspecifics and timing\nof such outcomes.\nThus, in the course of\nour activities, we\nhave incurred and may\nin the future incur\nlosses. Market\nconditions in recent\nyears have involved\nunprecedented\ndislocations and\nhighlight the\nlimitations inherent\nin using historical\ndata to manage risk.\n\nThe models that we use\nto assess and control\nour risk exposures\nreflect assumptions\nabout the degrees of\ncorrelation or lack\nthereof among prices\nof various asset\nclasses or other\nmarket indicators. In\ntimes of market stress\nor other unforeseen\ncircumstances,\npreviously\nuncorrelated\nindicators may become\ncorrelated, or\nconversely previously\ncorrelated indicators\nmay move in different\ndirections. These\ntypes of market\nmovements have at\ntimes limited the\neffectiveness of our\nhedging strategies and\nhave caused us to\nincur significant\nlosses, and they may\ndo so in the future.\nThese changes in\ncorrelation have been\nand may in the future\nbe exacerbated where\nother market\nparticipants are using\nrisk or trading models\nwith assumptions or\nalgorithms that are\nsimilar to ours. In\nthese and other cases,\nit may be difficult to\nreduce our risk\npositions due to the\nactivity of other\nmarket participants or\nwidespread market\ndislocations,\nincluding\ncircumstances where\nasset values are\ndeclining\nsignificantly or no\nmarket exists for\ncertain assets.\n\nIn addition, the use\nof models in\nconnection with risk\nmanagement and\nnumerous other\ncritical activities\npresents risks that\nthe models may be\nineffective, either\nbecause of poor\ndesign, ineffective\ntesting, or improper\nor flawed inputs, as\nwell as unpermitted\naccess to the models\nresulting in\nunapproved or\nmalicious changes to\nthe model or its\ninputs.\n\nTo the extent that we\nhave positions through\nour market-making or\norigination activities\nor we make investments\ndirectly through our\ninvesting activities,\nincluding private\nequity, that do not\nhave an established\nliquid trading market\nor are otherwise\nsubject to\nrestrictions on sale\nor hedging, we may not\nbe able to reduce our\npositions and\ntherefore reduce our\nrisk associated with\nthose positions. In\naddition, to the\nextent permitted by\napplicable law and\nregulation, we invest\nour own capital in\nprivate equity,\ncredit, real estate\nand hedge funds that\nwe manage and\nlimitations on our\nability to withdraw\nsome or all of our\ninvestments in these\nfunds, whether for\nlegal, reputational or\nother reasons, may\nmake it more difficult\nfor us to control the\nrisk exposures\nrelating to these\ninvestments.\n\nPrudent risk\nmanagement, as well as\nregulatory\nrestrictions, may\ncause us to limit our\nexposure to\ncounterparties,\ngeographic areas or\nmarkets, which may\nlimit our business\nopportunities and\nincrease the cost of\nour funding or hedging\nactivities.\n\nOur consumer offerings\npresent us with\ndifferent risks, and\nwe have needed and\ncontinue to need to\nexpand and adapt our\nrisk monitoring and\nmitigation activities\nto account for these\nbusiness activities.

The\nlevel of regulatory\nscrutiny and the scope\nof regulations\naffecting financial\ninteractions with\nconsumers is often\nmuch greater than that\nassociated with doing\nbusiness with\ninstitutions and high-\nnet-worth individuals.\nComplying with these\nregulations is time-\nconsuming, costly and\npresents new and\nincreased risks.\n\nOur expansion into\nconsumer-oriented\nactivities resulted in\na change to GS Bank\nUSA\u2019s CRA requirements\nin 2023, such that GS\nBank USA is no longer\nassessed as a\n\u201cwholesale bank\u201d for\nCRA compliance\npurposes and, instead,\nis assessed pursuant\nto a strategic plan.\nAny failure to comply\nwith different or\nexpanded CRA\nrequirements as a\nresult of this change\nin assessment methods\ncould negatively\nimpact GS Bank USA\u2019s\nCRA ratings, cause\nreputational harm and\nresult in limits on\nour ability to make\nfuture acquisitions or\nengage in certain new\nactivities.\n\nIncreasingly,\nregulators and courts\nhave sought to hold\nfinancial institutions\nliable for the\nmisconduct of their\nclients where they\nhave determined that\nthe financial\ninstitution should\nhave detected that the\nclient was engaged in\nwrongdoing, even\nthough the financial\ninstitution had no\ndirect knowledge of\nthe activities engaged\nin by its client.\nRegulators and courts\nhave also increasingly\nfound liability as a\n\u201ccontrol person\u201d for\nactivities of entities\nin which financial\ninstitutions or funds\ncontrolled by\nfinancial institutions\nhave an investment,\nbut which they do not\nactively manage. In\naddition, regulators\nand courts continue to\nseek to establish\n\u201cfiduciary\u201d\nobligations to\ncounterparties to\nwhich no such duty had\nbeen thought to exist.\nTo the extent that\nsuch efforts are\nsuccessful, the cost\nof, and liabilities\nassociated with,\nengaging in brokerage,\nclearing, market-\nmaking, prime\nfinancing, investing\nand other similar\nactivities could\nincrease\nsignificantly. To the\nextent that we have\nfiduciary obligations\nin connection with\nacting as a financial\nadviser or investment\nadviser or in other\nroles for individual,\ninstitutional,\nsovereign or\ninvestment fund\nclients, any breach,\nor even an alleged\nbreach, of such\nobligations could have\nmaterially negative\nlegal, regulatory and\nreputational\nconsequences.\n\nFor information about\nthe extensive\nregulation to which\nour businesses are\nsubject, see \u201cBusiness\n\u2014 Regulation\u201d in Part\nI, Item 1 of this Form\n10-K.\n\nA failure to\nappropriately identify\nand address potential\nconflicts of interest\ncould adversely affect\nour businesses.\n\nDue to the broad scope\nof our businesses and\nour client base, we\nregularly address\npotential conflicts of\ninterest, including\nsituations where our\nservices to a\nparticular client or\nour own investments or\nother interests\nconflict, or are\nperceived to conflict,\nwith the interests of\nthat client or another\nclient, as well as\nsituations where one\nor more of our\nbusinesses have access\nto material non-public\ninformation that may\nnot be shared with our\nother businesses and\nsituations where we\nmay be a creditor of\nan entity with which\nwe also have an\nadvisory or other\nrelationship.\n\nIn addition, our\nstatus as a BHC\nsubjects us to\nheightened regulation\nand increased\nregulatory scrutiny by\nthe FRB with respect\nto transactions\nbetween GS Bank USA\nand its subsidiaries\nand entities that are\nor could be viewed as\naffiliates of ours\nand, under the Volcker\nRule, transactions\nbetween us and covered\nfunds.\n\nWe have extensive\nprocedures and\ncontrols that are\ndesigned to identify\nand address conflicts\nof interest, including\nthose designed to\nprevent the improper\nsharing of information\namong our businesses.\nHowever, appropriately\nidentifying and\ndealing with conflicts\nof interest is complex\nand difficult, and our\nreputation, which is\none of our most\nimportant assets,\ncould be damaged and\nthe willingness of\nclients to enter into\ntransactions with us\nmay be adversely\naffected if we fail,\nor appear to fail, to\nidentify, disclose and\ndeal appropriately\nwith conflicts of\ninterest.

Press\ncoverage and other\npublic statements that\nassert some form of\nwrongdoing (including,\nin some cases, press\ncoverage and public\nstatements that do not\ndirectly involve us)\noften result in some\ntype of investigation\nby regulators,\nlegislators and law\nenforcement officials\nor in lawsuits.\n\nResponding to these\ninvestigations and\nlawsuits, regardless\nof the ultimate\noutcome of the\nproceeding, is time-\nconsuming and\nexpensive and can\ndivert the time and\neffort of our senior\nmanagement from our\nbusiness. Penalties\nand fines sought by\nregulatory authorities\nhave increased\nsubstantially and\ncertain regulators\nhave been more likely\nin recent years to\ncommence enforcement\nactions or to support\nlegislation targeted\nat the financial\nservices industry.\nGovernmental\nauthorities may also\nbe more likely to\npursue criminal or\nother actions,\nincluding seeking\nadmissions of\nwrongdoing or guilty\npleas, in connection\nwith the resolution of\nan inquiry or\ninvestigation to the\nextent a company is\nviewed as having\npreviously engaged in\ncriminal, regulatory\nor other misconduct.\nAdverse publicity,\ngovernmental scrutiny\nand legal and\nenforcement\nproceedings can also\nhave a negative impact\non our reputation and\non the morale and\nperformance of our\nemployees, which could\nadversely affect our\nbusinesses and results\nof operations.\nFurther, we are\nsubject to regulatory\nsettlements, orders\nand feedback that\nrequire significant\nremediation activities\nand enhancements to\nexisting controls,\nsystems and\nprocedures, which has\nrequired and will\nrequire us to commit\nsignificant resources,\nincluding hiring, as\nwell as testing the\noperation and\neffectiveness of new\ncontrols, policies and\nprocedures. The\nfailure to complete\nthese remediation\nactivities in a timely\nmanner could lead to\nhigher operating\nexpenses, reputational\ndamage and other\nnegative consequences.\n\nThe financial services\nindustry generally and\nour businesses in\nparticular have been\nsubject to negative\npublicity. Our\nreputation and\nbusinesses may be\nadversely affected by\nnegative publicity or\ninformation regarding\nour businesses and\npersonnel, whether or\nnot accurate or true,\nthat may be posted on\nsocial media or other\ninternet forums or\npublished by news\norganizations.\nPostings on these\ntypes of forums may\nalso adversely impact\nrisk positions of our\nclients and other\nparties that owe us\nmoney, securities or\nother assets and\nincrease the chance\nthat they will not\nperform their\nobligations to us or\nreduce the revenues we\nreceive from their use\nof our services. The\nspeed and\npervasiveness with\nwhich information can\nbe disseminated\nthrough these\nchannels, in\nparticular social\nmedia, may magnify\nrisks relating to\nnegative publicity.\n\nThe rapid\ndissemination of\nnegative information\nthrough social media,\nin part, is believed\nto have led to the\ncollapse of Silicon\nValley Bank (SVB). SVB\nsuffered a level of\ndeposit withdrawals\nwithin a time period\nnot previously\nexperienced by a\nfinancial institution.\nWe could also be\nsubject to rapid\ndeposit withdrawals or\nother outflows as a\nresult of negative\nsocial media posts or\nother negative\npublicity .\n\nSubstantial civil or\ncriminal liability or\nsignificant regulatory\naction against us\ncould have material\nadverse financial\neffects or cause us\nsignificant\nreputational harm,\nwhich in turn could\nseriously harm our\nbusiness prospects.\n\nWe face significant\nlegal risks in our\nbusinesses, and the\nvolume of claims and\namount of damages and\npenalties claimed in\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nagainst financial\ninstitutions remain\nhigh. See Notes 18 and\n27 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements\nin Part II, Item 8 of\nthis Form 10-K for\ninformation about\ncertain of our legal\nand regulatory\nproceedings and\ninvestigations.

The\nuncertain regulatory\nenforcement\nenvironment makes it\ndifficult to estimate\nprobable losses, which\ncan lead to\nsubstantial\ndisparities between\nlegal reserves and\nsubsequent actual\nsettlements or\npenalties.\n\nClaims of collusion or\nanti-competitive\nconduct have become\nmore common. Financial\ninstitutions\n(including us) have\nbeen subject to civil\ncases and\ninvestigatory demands\nrelating to alleged\nbid-rigging, group\nboycotts or other\nanti-competitive\npractices. Antitrust\nlaws generally provide\nfor joint and several\nliability and treble\ndamages. These claims\nhave resulted in\nsignificant\nsettlements and fines\nin the past and may do\nso in the future.\n\nWe are subject to laws\nand regulations\nworldwide, including\nthe FCPA and the U.K.\nBribery Act, relating\nto corrupt and illegal\npayments to, and\nhiring practices with\nregard to, government\nofficials and others.\nViolation of these or\nsimilar laws and\nregulations have in\nthe past resulted in\nand could in the\nfuture result in\nsignificant monetary\npenalties. Such\nviolations could also\nresult in severe\nrestrictions on our\nactivities and damage\nto our reputation.\n\nCertain law\nenforcement\nauthorities have\nrecently required\nadmissions of\nwrongdoing, and, in\nsome cases, criminal\npleas, as part of the\nresolutions of matters\nbrought against\nfinancial institutions\nor their employees.\nSee for example,\n\u201c1MDB-Related Matters\u201d\nin Note 27 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements in Part II,\nItem 8 of this Form\n10-K. Any such\nresolution of a\ncriminal matter\ninvolving us or our\nemployees could lead\nto increased exposure\nto civil litigation,\ncould adversely affect\nour reputation, could\nresult in penalties or\nlimitations on our\nability to conduct our\nactivities generally\nor in certain\ncircumstances and\ncould have other\nnegative effects.\nFurther, as a result\nof this type of\nsettlement, we are no\nlonger a \u201cwell-known\nseasoned issuer,\u201d\nwhich places\nlimitations on the\nmanner in which we can\nmarket our securities.\n\nIn conducting our\nbusinesses around the\nworld, we are subject\nto political, legal,\nregulatory and other\nrisks that are\ninherent in operating\nin many countries.\n\nIn conducting our\nbusinesses and\nsupporting our global\noperations, we are\nsubject to risks of\npossible\nnationalization,\nexpropriation, price\ncontrols, capital\ncontrols, exchange\ncontrols,\ncommunications and\nother content\nrestrictions, and\nother restrictive\ngovernmental actions.\nFor example, sanctions\nhave been imposed by\nthe U.S. and the E.U.\non certain individuals\nand companies in\nRussia and Venezuela.\nIn many countries, the\nlaws and regulations\napplicable to the\nsecurities and\nfinancial services\nindustries and many of\nthe transactions in\nwhich we are involved\nare uncertain and\nevolving, and it may\nbe difficult for us to\ndetermine the exact\nrequirements of local\nlaws in every market.\nWe have been in some\ncases subject to\ndivergent and\nconflicting laws and\nregulations across\nmarkets, and we are\nincreasingly subject\nto the risk that the\njurisdictions in which\nwe operate have\nimplemented or may\nimplement laws and\nregulations that\ndirectly conflict with\nthose of another\njurisdiction. Any\ndetermination by local\nregulators that we\nhave not acted in\ncompliance with the\napplication of local\nlaws in a particular\nmarket or our failure\nto develop effective\nworking relationships\nwith local regulators\ncould have a\nsignificant and\nnegative effect not\nonly on our businesses\nin that market, but\nalso on our reputation\ngenerally. Further, in\nsome jurisdictions a\nfailure, or alleged\nfailure, to comply\nwith laws and\nregulations has\nsubjected and may in\nthe future subject us\nand our personnel not\nonly to civil actions,\nbut also criminal\nactions and other\nsanctions. We are also\nsubject to the\nenhanced risk that\ntransactions we\nstructure might not be\nlegally enforceable in\nall cases.\n\nWhile business and\nother practices\nthroughout the world\ndiffer, our principal\nentities are subject\nin their operations\nworldwide to rules and\nregulations relating\nto corrupt and illegal\npayments, hiring\npractices and money\nlaundering, as well as\nlaws relating to doing\nbusiness with certain\nindividuals, groups\nand countries, such as\nthe FCPA, the BSA and\nthe U.K. Bribery Act.\nWhile we have invested\nand continue to invest\nsignificant resources\nin training and in\ncompliance monitoring,\nthe geographical\ndiversity of our\noperations, employees,\nclients and consumers,\nas well as the vendors\nand other third\nparties that we deal\nwith, greatly\nincreases the risk\nthat we may be found\nin violation of such\nrules or regulations\nand any such violation\ncould subject us to\nsignificant penalties\nor adversely affect\nour reputation.

This\nmisconduct has\nincluded and may also\nin the future include\nintentional efforts to\nignore or circumvent\napplicable policies,\nrules or procedures or\nmisappropriation of\nfunds and the theft of\nproprietary\ninformation, including\nproprietary software.\nIt is not always\npossible to deter or\nprevent employee\nmisconduct and the\nprecautions we take to\nprevent and detect\nthis activity have not\nbeen and may not be\neffective in all\ncases, as reflected by\nthe settlements\nrelating to 1MDB.\n\nThe application of\nregulatory strategies\nand requirements in\nthe U.S. and in\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions\nto facilitate the\norderly resolution of\nlarge financial\ninstitutions could\ncreate greater risk of\nloss for Group Inc.\u2019s\nsecurity holders.\n\nAs described in\n\u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation\n\u2014 Banking Supervision\nand Regulation \u2014\nInsolvency of an IDI\nor a BHC,\u201d if the FDIC\nis appointed as\nreceiver under OLA,\nthe rights of Group\nInc.\u2019s creditors would\nbe determined under\nOLA, and substantial\ndifferences exist in\nthe rights of\ncreditors between OLA\nand the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code,\nincluding the right of\nthe FDIC under OLA to\ndisregard the strict\npriority of creditor\nclaims in some\ncircumstances, which\ncould have a material\nadverse effect on our\ndebtholders.\n\nThe FDIC has announced\nthat a single point of\nentry strategy may be\na desirable strategy\nunder OLA to resolve a\nlarge financial\ninstitution in a\nmanner that would,\namong other things,\nimpose losses on\nshareholders,\ndebtholders and other\ncreditors of the top-\ntier BHC (in our case,\nGroup Inc.), while the\nBHC\u2019s subsidiaries may\ncontinue to operate.\nIt is possible that\nthe application of the\nsingle point of entry\nstrategy under OLA, in\nwhich Group Inc. would\nbe the only entity to\nenter resolution\nproceedings (and its\nmaterial broker-\ndealer, bank and other\noperating entities\nwould not enter\nresolution\nproceedings), would\nresult in greater\nlosses to Group Inc.\u2019s\nsecurity holders\n(including holders of\nour fixed rate,\nfloating rate and\nindexed debt\nsecurities), than the\nlosses that would\nresult from the\napplication of a\nbankruptcy proceeding\nor a different\nresolution strategy,\nsuch as a multiple\npoint of entry\nresolution strategy\nfor Group Inc. and\ncertain of its\nmaterial subsidiaries.\n\nAssuming Group Inc.\nentered resolution\nproceedings and\nsupport from Group\nInc. or other\nresources available to\nits subsidiaries was\nsufficient to enable\nthe subsidiaries to\nremain solvent, losses\nat the subsidiary\nlevel would be\ntransferred to Group\nInc. and ultimately\nborne by Group Inc.\u2019s\nsecurity holders,\nthird-party creditors\nof Group Inc.\u2019s\nsubsidiaries would\nreceive full\nrecoveries on their\nclaims, and Group\nInc.\u2019s security\nholders (including our\nshareholders,\ndebtholders and other\nunsecured creditors)\ncould face significant\nand possibly complete\nlosses. In that case,\nGroup Inc.\u2019s security\nholders would face\nlosses while the\nthird-party creditors\nof Group Inc.\u2019s\nsubsidiaries would\nincur no losses\nbecause the\nsubsidiaries would\ncontinue to operate\nand would not enter\nresolution or\nbankruptcy\nproceedings. In\naddition, holders of\nGroup Inc.\u2019s eligible\nlong-term debt and\nholders of Group\nInc.\u2019s other debt\nsecurities could face\nlosses ahead of its\nother similarly\nsituated creditors in\na resolution under OLA\nif the FDIC exercised\nits right, described\nabove, to disregard\nthe priority of\ncreditor claims.\n\nOLA also provides the\nFDIC with authority to\ncause creditors and\nshareholders of the\nfinancial company in\nreceivership to bear\nlosses before\ntaxpayers are exposed\nto such losses, and\namounts owed to the\nU.S. government would\ngenerally receive a\nstatutory payment\npriority over the\nclaims of private\ncreditors, including\nsenior creditors.\n\nIn addition, under\nOLA, claims of\ncreditors (including\ndebtholders) could be\nsatisfied through the\nissuance of equity or\nother securities in a\nbridge entity to which\nGroup Inc.\u2019s assets\nare transferred. If\nsuch a securities-for-\nclaims exchange were\nimplemented, there can\nbe no assurance that\nthe value of the\nsecurities of the\nbridge entity would be\nsufficient to repay or\nsatisfy all or any\npart of the creditor\nclaims for which the\nsecurities were\nexchanged. While the\nFDIC has issued\nregulations to\nimplement OLA, not all\naspects of how the\nFDIC might exercise\nthis authority are\nknown and additional\nrulemaking is\npossible.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    51  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn addition, certain\njurisdictions,\nincluding the U.K. and\nthe E.U., have\nimplemented resolution\nregimes to provide\nresolution authorities\nwith the ability to\nrecapitalize a failing\nentity by writing down\nits unsecured debt or\nconverting its\nunsecured debt into\nequity. Such \u201cbail-in\u201d\npowers are intended to\nenable the\nrecapitalization of a\nfailing institution by\nallocating losses to\nits shareholders and\nunsecured debtholders.\nFor example, the Bank\nof England requires a\ncertain amount of\nintercompany funding\nthat we provide to our\nmaterial U.K.\nsubsidiaries to\ncontain a contractual\ntrigger to expressly\npermit the Bank of\nEngland to exercise\nsuch \u201cbail-in\u201d powers\nin certain\ncircumstances. If the\nintercompany funding\nwe provide to our\nsubsidiaries is\n\u201cbailed in,\u201d Group\nInc.\u2019s claims on its\nsubsidiaries would be\nsubordinated to the\nclaims of the\nsubsidiaries\u2019 third-\nparty creditors or\nwritten down. U.S.\nregulators are\nconsidering and\nnon-U.S. authorities\nhave adopted\nrequirements that\ncertain subsidiaries\nof large financial\ninstitutions maintain\nminimum amounts of\ntotal loss-absorbing\ncapacity that would\npass losses up from\nthe subsidiaries to\nthe top-tier BHC and,\nultimately, to\nsecurity holders of\nthe top-tier BHC in\nthe event of failure.\n\nThe application of\nGroup Inc.\u2019s proposed\nresolution strategy\ncould result in\ngreater losses for\nGroup Inc.\u2019s security\nholders.\n\nIn our resolution\nplan, Group Inc. would\nbe resolved under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nThe strategy described\nin our resolution plan\nis a variant of the\nsingle point of entry\nstrategy: Group Inc.\nand Goldman Sachs\nFunding LLC (Funding\nIHC), a wholly-owned,\ndirect subsidiary of\nGroup Inc., would\nrecapitalize and\nprovide liquidity to\ncertain major\nsubsidiaries,\nincluding through the\nforgiveness of\nintercompany\nindebtedness, the\nextension of the\nmaturities of\nintercompany\nindebtedness and the\nextension of\nadditional\nintercompany loans. If\nthis strategy were\nsuccessful, creditors\nof some or all of\nGroup Inc.\u2019s major\nsubsidiaries would\nreceive full\nrecoveries on their\nclaims, while Group\nInc.\u2019s security\nholders could face\nsignificant and\npossibly complete\nlosses.\n\nTo facilitate the\nexecution of our\nresolution plan, we\nformed Funding IHC. In\nexchange for an\nunsecured subordinated\nfunding note and\nequity interest, Group\nInc. transferred\ncertain intercompany\nreceivables and\nsubstantially all of\nits GCLA to Funding\nIHC, and agreed to\ntransfer additional\nGCLA above prescribed\nthresholds.\n\nWe also put in place a\nCapital and Liquidity\nSupport Agreement\n(CLSA) among Group\nInc., Funding IHC and\nour major\nsubsidiaries. Under\nthe CLSA, Funding IHC\nhas provided Group\nInc. with a committed\nline of credit that\nallows Group Inc. to\ndraw sufficient funds\nto meet its cash needs\nduring the ordinary\ncourse of business. In\naddition, if our\nfinancial resources\ndeteriorate so\nseverely that\nresolution may be\nimminent, (i) the\ncommitted line of\ncredit will\nautomatically\nterminate and the\nunsecured subordinated\nfunding note will\nautomatically be\nforgiven, (ii) all\nintercompany\nreceivables owed by\nthe major subsidiaries\nto Group Inc. will be\ntransferred to Funding\nIHC or their\nmaturities will be\nextended to five\nyears, (iii) Group\nInc. will be obligated\nto transfer\nsubstantially all of\nits remaining\nintercompany\nreceivables and GCLA\n(other than an amount\nto fund anticipated\nbankruptcy expenses)\nto Funding IHC, and\n(iv) Funding IHC will\nbe obligated to\nprovide capital and\nliquidity support to\nthe major\nsubsidiaries. Group\nInc.\u2019s and Funding\nIHC\u2019s obligations\nunder the CLSA are\nsecured pursuant to a\nrelated security\nagreement.

We compete\non the basis of a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding transaction\nexecution, our\nproducts and services,\ninnovation,\nreputation,\ncreditworthiness and\nprice. There has been\nsubstantial\nconsolidation and\nconvergence among\ncompanies in the\nfinancial services\nindustry.

As a result,\nwe have had to commit\ncapital to support our\ninternational\noperations and to\nexecute large global\ntransactions. As we\nhave expanded into new\nbusiness areas and new\ngeographic regions, we\nhave faced competitors\nwith more experience\nand more established\nrelationships with\nclients, regulators\nand industry\nparticipants in the\nrelevant market, which\ncould adversely affect\nour ability to expand\nour businesses.\n\nGovernments and\nregulators have\nadopted regulations,\nimposed taxes, adopted\ncompensation\nrestrictions or\notherwise put forward\nvarious proposals that\nhave impacted or may\nimpact our ability to\nconduct certain of our\nbusinesses in a cost-\neffective manner or at\nall in certain or all\njurisdictions,\nincluding proposals\nrelating to\nrestrictions on the\ntype of activities in\nwhich financial\ninstitutions are\npermitted to engage.\nThese or other similar\nrules, many of which\ndo not apply to all\nour U.S. or non-U.S.\ncompetitors, could\nimpact our ability to\ncompete effectively.\n\nPricing and other\ncompetitive pressures\nin our businesses have\ncontinued to increase,\nparticularly in\nsituations where some\nof our competitors may\nseek to increase\nmarket share by\nreducing prices.

Many\ntransactions are\nsyndicated to other\nfinancial\ninstitutions, and\nfinancial institutions\nare often\ncounterparties in\ntransactions. This has\nled to claims by other\nmarket participants\nand regulators that\nsuch institutions have\ncolluded in order to\nmanipulate markets or\nmarket prices,\nincluding allegations\nthat antitrust laws\nhave been violated.\nWhile we have\nextensive procedures\nand controls that are\ndesigned to identify\nand prevent such\nactivities, they may\nnot be effective.\nAllegations of such\nactivities,\nparticularly by\nregulators, can have a\nnegative reputational\nimpact and can subject\nus to large fines and\nsettlements, and\npotentially\nsignificant penalties,\nincluding treble\ndamages.\n                                      \n  54    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe growth of\nelectronic trading and\nthe introduction of\nnew products and\ntechnologies,\nincluding trading and\ndistributed ledger\ntechnologies,\nincluding\ncryptocurrencies, has\nincreased competition.\n\nTechnology is\nfundamental to our\nbusiness and our\nindustry. The growth\nof electronic trading\nand the introduction\nof new technologies is\nchanging our\nbusinesses and\npresenting us with new\nchallenges.\nSecurities, futures\nand options\ntransactions are\nincreasingly occurring\nelectronically, both\non our own systems and\nthrough other\nalternative trading\nsystems, and it\nappears that the trend\ntoward alternative\ntrading systems will\ncontinue. Some of\nthese alternative\ntrading systems\ncompete with us,\nparticularly our\nexchange-based market-\nmaking activities, and\nwe may experience\ncontinued competitive\npressures in these and\nother areas. In\naddition, the\nincreased use by our\nclients of low-cost\nelectronic trading\nsystems and direct\nelectronic access to\ntrading markets has\ncaused and could\ncontinue to cause a\nreduction in\ncommissions and\nspreads. As our\nclients increasingly\nuse our systems to\ntrade directly in the\nmarkets, we may incur\nliabilities as a\nresult of their use of\nour order routing and\nexecution\ninfrastructure.\n\nWe have invested\nsignificant resources\ninto the development\nof electronic trading\nsystems and expect to\ncontinue to do so, but\nthere is no assurance\nthat the revenues\ngenerated by these\nsystems will yield an\nadequate return,\nparticularly given the\ngenerally lower\ncommissions arising\nfrom electronic\ntrades.\n\nIn addition, the\nemergence, adoption\nand evolution of new\ntechnologies,\nincluding distributed\nledgers, such as\ndigital assets and\nblockchain, and AI,\nhave required us to\ninvest resources to\nadapt our existing\nproducts and services,\nand we expect to\ncontinue to make such\ninvestments, which\ncould be material. The\nadoption and evolution\nof such new\ntechnologies may also\nincrease our\ncompliance and\nregulatory costs.\nFurther, technologies,\nsuch as those based on\ndistributed ledgers,\nthat do not require\nintermediation could\nalso significantly\ndisrupt payments\nprocessing and other\nfinancial services.\nRegulatory limitations\non our involvement in\nproducts and platforms\ninvolving digital\nassets and distributed\nledger technologies\nmay not apply equally\nor in some cases at\nall to certain of our\ncompetitors.

Factors\nthat affect our\nability to attract and\nretain such employees\ninclude the level and\ncomposition of our\ncompensation and\nbenefits, and our\nreputation as a\nsuccessful business\nwith a culture of\nfairly hiring,\ntraining and promoting\nqualified employees.\nAs a significant\nportion of the\ncompensation that we\npay to our employees\nis in the form of\nyear-end discretionary\ncompensation, a\nsignificant portion of\nwhich is in the form\nof deferred equity-\nrelated awards,\ndeclines in our\nprofitability, or in\nthe outlook for our\nfuture profitability,\nas well as regulatory\nlimitations on\ncompensation levels\nand terms, can\nnegatively impact our\nability to hire and\nretain highly\nqualified employees.\n\nCompetition from\nwithin the financial\nservices industry and\nfrom businesses\noutside the financial\nservices industry,\nincluding the\ntechnology industry,\nfor qualified\nemployees has often\nbeen intense. We have\nexperienced increased\ncompetition in hiring\nand retaining\nemployees to address\nthe demands of our\nconsumer-oriented\nbusinesses and our\ntechnology\ninitiatives. This is\nalso the case in\nemerging and growth\nmarkets, where we are\noften competing for\nqualified employees\nwith entities that\nhave a significantly\ngreater presence or\nmore extensive\nexperience in the\nregion.\n\nLaws or regulations in\njurisdictions in which\nour operations are\nlocated that affect\ntaxes on our\nemployees\u2019 income or\nthe amount or\ncomposition of\ncompensation, or that\nrequire us to disclose\nour or our\ncompetitors\u2019\ncompensation\npractices, may also\nadversely affect our\nability to hire and\nretain qualified\nemployees in those\njurisdictions.\n\nAs described further\nin \u201cBusiness \u2014\nRegulation\n\u2014Compensation\nPractices\u201d in Part I,\nItem 1 of this Form\n10-K, our compensation\npractices are subject\nto review by, and the\nstandards of, the FRB.\nAs a large global\nfinancial and banking\ninstitution, we are\nsubject to limitations\non compensation\npractices (which may\nor may not affect the\ncompanies with which\nwe compete for talent)\nby the FRB, the PRA,\nthe FCA, the FDIC and\nother regulators\nworldwide.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur business,\nfinancial condition,\nliquidity and results\nof operations may be\nadversely affected by\ndisruptions in the\nglobal economy caused\nby escalating tensions\nbetween the U.S. and\nChina.\n\nContinued or\nescalating tensions\nbetween the U.S. and\nChina have resulted in\nand may result in\nadditional changes to\nU.S. international\ntrade and investment\npolicies, which could\ndisrupt international\ntrade and investment,\nadversely affect\nfinancial markets,\nincluding market\nactivity levels, and\nadversely impact our\nrevenues. Continued or\nescalating tensions\nmay also lead to the\nU.S., China or other\ncountries taking other\nactions, which could\ninclude the\nimplementation of\nsanctions, tariffs or\nforeign exchange\nmeasures, the large-\nscale sale of U.S.\nTreasury securities or\nrestrictions on cross-\nborder trade,\ninvestment or transfer\nof information or\ntechnology. Any such\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect our\nor our clients\u2019\nbusinesses, as well as\nour financial\ncondition, liquidity\nand results of\noperations, possibly\nmaterially.\n\nA conflict, or\nconcerns about a\npotential conflict,\ninvolving China and\nTaiwan, the U.S. or\nother countries could\nnegatively impact\nfinancial markets and\nour or our clients\u2019\nbusinesses. Trade\nrestrictions by the\nU.S. or other\ncountries in response\nto a conflict or\npotential conflict\ninvolving China,\nincluding financial\nand economic sanctions\nand export controls\nagainst certain\norganizations or\nindividuals, or\nactions taken by China\nin response to trade\nrestrictions, could\nnegatively impact our\nor our clients\u2019\nability to conduct\nbusiness in certain\ncountries or with\ncertain counterparties\nand could negatively\nimpact regional and\nglobal financial\nmarkets and economic\nconditions. Any of the\nforegoing could\nadversely affect our\nbusiness, financial\ncondition, liquidity\nand results of\noperations, possibly\nmaterially.\n\nWe face enhanced risks\nas we operate in new\nlocations and transact\nwith a broader array\nof clients and\ncounterparties.\n\nOur businesses, have\nin the past, and may\nin the future, bring\nus into contact,\ndirectly or\nindirectly, with\nindividuals and\nentities that are not\nwithin our traditional\nclient and\ncounterparty base,\nexpose us to new asset\nclasses and new\nmarkets, and present\nus with integration\nchallenges. For\nexample, we continue\nto transact business\nand invest in new\nregions, including a\nwide range of emerging\nand growth markets,\nand we expect this\ntrend to continue.\nVarious emerging and\ngrowth market\ncountries have\nexperienced severe\neconomic and financial\ndisruptions, including\nsignificant\ndevaluations of their\ncurrencies, defaults\nor threatened defaults\non sovereign debt,\ncapital and currency\nexchange controls, and\nlow or negative growth\nrates in their\neconomies. The\npossible effects of\nany of these\nconditions include an\nadverse impact on our\nbusinesses and\nincreased volatility\nin financial markets\ngenerally.\n\nFurthermore, in a\nnumber of our\nbusinesses, including\nwhere we make markets,\ninvest and lend, we\nown interests in, or\notherwise become\naffiliated with the\nownership and\noperation of, public\nservices, such as\nairports, toll roads\nand shipping ports, as\nwell as physical\ncommodities and\ncommodities\ninfrastructure\ncomponents, both\nwithin and outside the\nU.S.\n\nIn our consumer-\noriented activities,\nwe have faced and\ncontinue to face,\nadditional compliance,\nlegal and regulatory\nrisk, increased\nreputational risk and\nincreased operational\nrisk due to, among\nother things, higher\ntransaction volumes\nand significantly\nincreased retention\nand transmission of\nconsumer and client\ninformation. We are\nalso subject to\nadditional legal\nrequirements,\nincluding with respect\nto suitability and\nconsumer protection\n(for example,\nRegulation Best\nInterest, fair lending\nlaws and regulations\nand privacy laws and\nregulations). Further,\nidentity fraud may\nincrease and credit\nreporting practices\nmay change in a manner\nthat makes it more\ndifficult for\nfinancial\ninstitutions, such as\nus, to evaluate the\ncreditworthiness of\nconsumers.\n\nWe have increased and\nintend to further\nincrease our\ntransaction banking\nactivities. As a\nresult, we face\nadditional compliance,\nlegal and regulatory\nrisk, including with\nrespect to know-your-\ncustomer, anti-money\nlaundering and\nreporting requirements\nand prohibitions on\ntransfers of property\nbelonging to\ncountries, entities\nand individuals\nsubject to sanctions\nby U.S. or other\ngovernmental\nauthorities. We are\nmaking significant\nenhancements to\nexisting controls,\nsystems and procedures\nto manage these risks.\n                                      \n  58    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNew business\ninitiatives expose us\nto new and enhanced\nrisks, including risks\nassociated with\ndealing with\ngovernmental entities,\nreputational concerns\narising from dealing\nwith different types\nof clients, business\npartners,\ncounterparties and\ninvestors, greater\nregulatory scrutiny of\nthese activities,\nincreased credit-\nrelated, market,\nsovereign and\noperational risks,\nrisks arising from\naccidents or acts of\nterrorism, and\nreputational concerns\nwith the manner in\nwhich certain assets\nare being operated or\nheld or in which we\ninteract with these\nclients, business\npartners,\ncounterparties and\ninvestors. Legal,\nregulatory and\nreputational risks may\nalso exist in\nconnection with\nactivities and\ntransactions involving\nnew products or\nmarkets where there is\nregulatory uncertainty\nor where there are\ndifferent or\nconflicting\nregulations depending\non the regulator or\nthe jurisdiction\ninvolved, particularly\nwhere transactions in\nsuch products may\ninvolve multiple\njurisdictions.\n\nWe have developed and\npursued new business\nand strategic\ninitiatives, including\nacquisitions, and may\ncontinue to do so. If\nand to the extent we\nare unable to\nsuccessfully execute\nthose initiatives, we\nmay incur\nunanticipated costs\nand losses, and face\nother adverse\nconsequences, such as\nnegative reputational\neffects. In addition,\nthe actual effects of\npursuing those\ninitiatives may\ndiffer, possibly\nmaterially, from the\nbenefits that we\nexpect to realize from\nthem, such as\ngenerating additional\nrevenues, achieving\nexpense savings,\nreducing operational\nrisk exposures or\nusing capital and\nfunding more\nefficiently. Engaging\nin new activities\nexposes us to a\nvariety of risks,\nincluding that we may\nbe unable to\nsuccessfully develop\nnew, competitive,\nefficient and\neffective systems and\nprocesses, and hire\nand retain the\nnecessary personnel.\nDue to our lack of\nhistorical experience\nwith unsecured\nconsumer lending, our\nloan loss assumptions\nmay prove to be\nincorrect and we may\nincur losses\nsignificantly above\nthose which we\noriginally anticipated\nin entering the\nbusiness or in\nexpanding the product\nofferings for the\nbusiness.\n\nIn recent years, we\nhave invested, and may\ncontinue to invest,\nmore in businesses\nthat we expect will\ngenerate a higher\nlevel of more\nconsistent revenues.\nSuch investments and\nacquisitions may not\nbe successful or have\nreturns similar to our\nother businesses.\n\nWe may not be able to\nfully realize the\nexpected benefits or\nsynergies from\nacquisitions or other\nbusiness initiatives\nin the time frames we\nexpect, or at all.\n\nWe have engaged in\nselective acquisitions\nand may continue to do\nso in the future and\nthese acquisitions\nmay, individually or\nin the aggregate, be\nmaterial to us. Any\nfuture acquisitions\ncould involve the\nissuance of common\nstock and/or the\npayment of cash as\nconsideration. The\nsuccess of our\nacquisitions will\ndepend, in part, on\nour ability to\nintegrate the acquired\nbusinesses and realize\nanticipated synergies,\ncost savings and\ngrowth opportunities.\nFor example, in the\nfourth quarter of\n2023, we entered into\nan agreement to sell\nGreenSky and sold PFM,\nboth of which we had\npreviously acquired,\nand in connection with\nthe GreenSky\ndisposition incurred a\nwrite-down of\nintangible assets and\ngoodwill. We may face\nnumerous risks and\nuncertainties in\ncombining and\nintegrating the\nrelevant businesses\nand systems, including\nthe need to combine or\nseparate accounting\nand data processing\nsystems and management\ncontrols and to\nintegrate\nrelationships with\nclients,\ncounterparties,\nregulators and others\nin connection with\nacquisitions.\nIntegration of\nacquired businesses is\ntime-consuming and\ncould disrupt our\nongoing businesses,\nproduce unforeseen\nregulatory or\noperating\ndifficulties, cause us\nto incur incremental\nexpenses or require\nincremental financial,\nmanagement and other\nresources. It is also\npossible that an\nacquisition, once\nannounced, may not\nclose due to the\nfailure to satisfy\napplicable closing\nconditions, such as\nthe receipt of\nnecessary shareholder\nor regulatory\napprovals.\n\nThere is no assurance\nthat any of our\nacquisitions will be\nsuccessfully\nintegrated or yield\nall of the expected\nbenefits and synergies\nin the time frames\nthat we expect, or at\nall. If we are not\nable to integrate our\nacquisitions\nsuccessfully, our\nresults of operations,\nfinancial condition\nand cash flows could\nbe adversely affected.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    59  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

During the\nearly part of the\nyear, momentum was\ntemporarily disrupted\nby stress in the\nbanking sector, which\nled to the failure of\ncertain regional banks\nin the U.S. and the\ncombination of\nSwitzerland\u2019s two\nlargest financial\ninstitutions,\nresulting in a period\nof high interest rate\nvolatility before\nconcerns subsided\nafter regional banks\nshowed stability.\nGeopolitical stresses\nthat carried over into\n2023, including the\nconflict in Ukraine\nand ongoing tensions\nwith China, remained\nelevated.\nAdditionally, the\nrenewed onset of\nconflict in the Middle\nEast added to the\nuncertainty of global\nstability. The above\nfactors contributed to\nhigher global equity\nprices compared with\nthe end of 2022 and\npressure in the\ncommercial real estate\nmarket.\n\nThere remains\nuncertainty and\nconcerns about\ngeopolitical risks,\nglobal central bank\npolicy, inflation, the\ncommercial real estate\nsector and potential\nincreases in\nregulatory capital\nrequirements.

The use of\nfair value to measure\nfinancial instruments\nis fundamental to our\nrisk management\npractices and is our\nmost critical\naccounting policy.\n\nThe fair value of a\nfinancial instrument\nis the amount that\nwould be received to\nsell an asset or paid\nto transfer a\nliability in an\norderly transaction\nbetween market\nparticipants at the\nmeasurement date. We\nmeasure certain\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities as a\nportfolio (i.e., based\non its net exposure to\nmarket and/or credit\nrisks). In determining\nfair value, the\nhierarchy under U.S.\ngenerally accepted\naccounting principles\n(U.S. GAAP) gives (i)\nthe highest priority\nto unadjusted quoted\nprices in active\nmarkets for identical,\nunrestricted assets or\nliabilities (level 1\ninputs), (ii) the next\npriority to inputs\nother than level 1\ninputs that are\nobservable, either\ndirectly or indirectly\n(level 2 inputs), and\n(iii) the lowest\npriority to inputs\nthat cannot be\nobserved in market\nactivity (level 3\ninputs). In evaluating\nthe significance of a\nvaluation input, we\nconsider, among other\nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s\nnet risk exposure to\nthat input. Assets and\nliabilities are\nclassified in their\nentirety based on the\nlowest level of input\nthat is significant to\ntheir fair value\nmeasurement.\n\nThe fair values for\nsubstantially all of\nour financial assets\nand liabilities are\nbased on observable\nprices and inputs and\nare classified in\nlevels 1 and 2 of the\nfair value hierarchy.\nCertain level 2 and\nlevel 3 financial\nassets and liabilities\nmay require\nappropriate valuation\nadjustments that a\nmarket participant\nwould require to\narrive at fair value\nfor factors, such as\ncounterparty and our\ncredit quality,\nfunding risk, transfer\nrestrictions,\nliquidity and\nbid/offer spreads.\n\nInstruments classified\nin level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy are\nthose which require\none or more\nsignificant inputs\nthat are not\nobservable. Level 3\nfinancial assets\nrepresented 1.5% as of\nDecember 2023 and 1.8%\nas of December 2022 of\nour total assets. See\nNotes 4 and 5 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about\nlevel 3 financial\nassets, including\nchanges in level 3\nfinancial assets and\nrelated fair value\nmeasurements. Absent\nevidence to the\ncontrary, instruments\nclassified in level 3\nof the fair value\nhierarchy are\ninitially valued at\ntransaction price,\nwhich is considered to\nbe the best initial\nestimate of fair\nvalue. Subsequent to\nthe transaction date,\nwe use other\nmethodologies to\ndetermine fair value,\nwhich vary based on\nthe type of\ninstrument. Estimating\nthe fair value of\nlevel 3 financial\ninstruments requires\njudgments to be made.\nThese judgments\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 Determining the\nappropriate valuation\nmethodology and/or\nmodel for each type of\nlevel 3 financial\ninstrument;\n\n\u2022 Determining model\ninputs based on an\nevaluation of all\nrelevant empirical\nmarket data, including\nprices evidenced by\nmarket transactions,\ninterest rates, credit\nspreads, volatilities\nand correlations; and\n\n\u2022 Determining\nappropriate valuation\nadjustments, including\nthose related to\nilliquidity or\ncounterparty credit\nquality.\n\nRegardless of the\nmethodology, valuation\ninputs and assumptions\nare only changed when\ncorroborated by\nsubstantive evidence.\n                                      \n  64    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Market\nmakers and investment\nprofessionals in our\nrevenue-producing\nunits are responsible\nfor pricing our\nfinancial instruments.\nOur control\ninfrastructure is\nindependent of the\nrevenue-producing\nunits and is\nfundamental to\nensuring that all of\nour financial\ninstruments are\nappropriately valued\nat market-clearing\nlevels. In the event\nthat there is a\ndifference of opinion\nin situations where\nestimating the fair\nvalue of financial\ninstruments requires\njudgment (e.g.,\ncalibration to market\ncomparables or trade\ncomparison, as\ndescribed below), the\nfinal valuation\ndecision is made by\nsenior managers in\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions. This\nindependent price\nverification is\ncritical to ensuring\nthat our financial\ninstruments are\nproperly valued.\n\nPrice Verification.\nAll financial\ninstruments at fair\nvalue classified in\nlevels 1, 2 and 3 of\nthe fair value\nhierarchy are subject\nto our independent\nprice verification\nprocess. The objective\nof price verification\nis to have an informed\nand independent\nopinion with regard to\nthe valuation of\nfinancial instruments\nunder review.\nInstruments that have\none or more\nsignificant inputs\nwhich cannot be\ncorroborated by\nexternal market data\nare classified in\nlevel 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy. Price\nverification\nstrategies utilized by\nour independent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions include:\n\n\u2022 Trade Comparison.\nAnalysis of trade data\n(both internal and\nexternal, where\navailable) is used to\ndetermine the most\nrelevant pricing\ninputs and valuations.\n\n\u2022 External Price\nComparison.

Data\nobtained from various\nsources is compared to\nensure consistency and\nvalidity. When broker\nor dealer quotations\nor third-party pricing\nvendors are used for\nvaluation or price\nverification, greater\npriority is generally\ngiven to executable\nquotations.\n\n\u2022 Calibration to\nMarket Comparables.\nMarket-based\ntransactions are used\nto corroborate the\nvaluation of positions\nwith similar\ncharacteristics, risks\nand components.\n\n\u2022 Relative Value\nAnalyses.

The\nexpected life of each\nloan or lending\ncommitment is\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual term\nadjusted for extension\noptions or demand\nfeatures, or is\nmodeled in the case of\nrevolving credit card\nloans. The forecasts\ninclude baseline,\nfavorable and adverse\neconomic scenarios\nover a three-year\nperiod. For loans with\nexpected lives beyond\nthree years, the model\nreverts to historical\nloss information based\non a non-linear\nmodeled approach. We\napply judgment in\nweighting individual\nscenarios each quarter\nbased on a variety of\nfactors, including our\ninternally derived\neconomic outlook,\nmarket consensus,\nrecent macroeconomic\nconditions and\nindustry trends. The\nforecasted economic\nscenarios consider a\nnumber of risk factors\nrelevant to the\nwholesale and consumer\nportfolios. Risk\nfactors for wholesale\nloans include internal\ncredit ratings,\nindustry default and\nloss data, expected\nlife, macroeconomic\nindicators (e.g.,\nunemployment rates and\nGDP), the borrower\u2019s\ncapacity to meet its\nfinancial obligations,\nthe borrower\u2019s country\nof risk and industry,\nloan seniority and\ncollateral type. In\naddition, for loans\nbacked by real estate,\nrisk factors include\nthe loan-to-value\nratio, debt service\nratio and home price\nindex. The allowance\nfor loan losses for\nwholesale loans that\ndo not share similar\nrisk characteristics,\nsuch as nonaccrual\nloans, is calculated\nusing the present\nvalue of expected\nfuture cash flows\ndiscounted at the\nloan\u2019s effective rate,\nthe observable market\nprice of the loan, or,\nin the case of\ncollateral dependent\nloans, the fair value\nof the collateral less\nestimated costs to\nsell, if applicable.\nRisk factors for\ninstallment and credit\ncard loans include\nFair Isaac Corporation\n(FICO) credit scores,\ndelinquency status,\nloan vintage and\nmacroeconomic\nindicators.\n\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses also\nincludes qualitative\ncomponents which allow\nmanagement to reflect\nthe uncertain nature\nof economic\nforecasting, capture\nuncertainty regarding\nmodel inputs, and\naccount for model\nimprecision and\nconcentration risk.\n\nOur estimate of credit\nlosses entails\njudgment about\ncollectability at the\nreporting dates, and\nthere are\nuncertainties inherent\nin those judgments.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses is\nsubject to a\ngovernance process\nthat involves review\nand approval by senior\nmanagement within our\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions. Personnel\nwithin our independent\nrisk oversight and\ncontrol functions are\nresponsible for\nforecasting the\neconomic variables\nthat underlie the\neconomic scenarios\nthat are used in the\nmodeling of expected\ncredit losses. While\nwe use the best\ninformation available\nto determine this\nestimate, future\nadjustments to the\nallowance may be\nnecessary based on,\namong other things,\nchanges in the\neconomic environment\nor variances between\nactual results and the\noriginal assumptions\nused. Loans are\ncharged off against\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses when deemed to\nbe uncollectible.\n\nWe also record an\nallowance for credit\nlosses on lending\ncommitments which are\nheld for investment\nthat are accounted for\nat amortized cost.\nSuch allowance is\ndetermined using the\nsame methodology as\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses, while also\ntaking into\nconsideration the\nprobability of\ndrawdowns or funding,\nand whether such\ncommitments are\ncancellable by us.\n\nTo estimate the\npotential impact of an\nadverse macroeconomic\nenvironment on our\nallowance for credit\nlosses, we, among\nother things, compared\nthe expected credit\nlosses under the\nweighted average\nforecast used in the\ncalculation of\nallowance for credit\nlosses as of December\n2023 (which was\nweighted towards the\nbaseline and adverse\neconomic scenarios) to\nthe expected credit\nlosses under a 100%\nweighted adverse\neconomic scenario. The\nadverse economic\nscenario of the\nforecast model\nreflects a global\nrecession in the first\nquarter of 2024\nthrough the first\nquarter of 2025,\nresulting in an\neconomic contraction\nand rising\nunemployment rates. A\n100% weighting to the\nadverse economic\nscenario would have\nresulted in an\napproximate $0.7\nbillion increase in\nour allowance for\ncredit losses as of\nDecember 2023. This\nhypothetical increase\ndoes not take into\nconsideration any\npotential adjustments\nto qualitative\nreserves. The\nforecasts of\nmacroeconomic\nconditions are\ninherently uncertain\nand do not take into\naccount any other\noffsetting or\ncorrelated effects.\nThe actual credit loss\nin an adverse\nmacroeconomic\nenvironment may differ\nsignificantly from\nthis estimate.

When assessing\ngoodwill for\nimpairment, first, a\nqualitative assessment\ncan be made to\ndetermine whether it\nis more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of a\nreporting unit is less\nthan its carrying\nvalue. If the results\nof the qualitative\nassessment are not\nconclusive, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest is performed.\nAlternatively, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest can be performed\nwithout performing a\nqualitative\nassessment. Estimating\nthe fair value of our\nreporting units\nrequires judgment.\nCritical inputs to the\nfair value estimates\ninclude projected\nearnings, allocated\nequity, price-to-\nearnings multiples and\nprice-to-book\nmultiples. There is\ninherent uncertainty\nin the projected\nearnings. The carrying\nvalue of each\nreporting unit\nreflects an allocation\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity and represents\nthe estimated amount\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity required to\nsupport the activities\nof the reporting unit\nunder currently\napplicable regulatory\ncapital requirements.\nDuring the second\nquarter of 2023, in\nconnection with the\nexploration of a\npotential sale of\nGreenSky, we performed\na quantitative\ngoodwill test and\ndetermined that the\ngoodwill associated\nwith Consumer\nplatforms was\nimpaired, and\naccordingly, recorded\na $504 million\nimpairment. In the\nfourth quarter of\n2023, we performed our\nannual assessment of\ngoodwill for\nimpairment, for each\nof our reporting units\nwith goodwill, by\nperforming a\nqualitative\nassessment. Multiple\nfactors were assessed\nwith respect to each\nof these reporting\nunits to determine\nwhether it was more\nlikely than not that\nthe estimated fair\nvalue of any of these\nreporting units was\nless than its carrying\nvalue. The qualitative\nassessment also\nconsidered changes\nsince a quantitative\ntest across all of our\nreporting units was\nlast performed in\n2022. As a result of\nthe qualitative\nassessment, we\ndetermined that it was\nmore likely than not\nthat the estimated\nfair value of each\nreporting unit with\ngoodwill exceeded its\nrespective carrying\nvalue. Therefore, we\ndetermined that\ngoodwill for each\nreporting unit was not\nimpaired and that a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest was not required.\nSee Note 12 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about our\nannual assessment of\ngoodwill for\nimpairment. If we\nexperience a prolonged\nor severe period of\nweakness in the\nbusiness environment,\nfinancial markets, the\nperformance of one or\nmore of our reporting\nunits or our common\nstock price, or\nadditional increases\nin capital\nrequirements, our\ngoodwill could be\nimpaired in the\nfuture.\n\nIdentifiable\nintangible assets are\ntested for impairment\nwhen events or changes\nin circumstances\nsuggest that an\nasset\u2019s or asset\ngroup\u2019s carrying value\nmay not be fully\nrecoverable. Judgment\nis required to\nevaluate whether\nindications of\npotential impairment\nhave occurred, and to\ntest identifiable\nintangible assets for\nimpairment, if\nrequired. An\nimpairment is\nrecognized if the\nestimated undiscounted\ncash flows relating to\nthe asset or asset\ngroup is less than the\ncorresponding carrying\nvalue.\n\nIn the third quarter\nof 2023, in connection\nwith the planned sale\nof GreenSky, we\nclassified the related\nidentifiable\nintangible assets, loa\nns and other assets\nand associated\nliabilities as held\nfor sale and\nrecognized a $506\nmillion write-down.\nSee Note 12 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for f\nurther information\nabout identifiable\nintangible assets.\n\nWe also estimate and\nprovide for potential\nlosses that may arise\nout of litigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nto the extent that\nsuch losses are\nprobable and can be\nreasonably estimated.\nIn addition, we\nestimate the upper end\nof the range of\nreasonably possible\naggregate loss in\nexcess of the related\nreserves for\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nwhere we believe the\nrisk of loss is more\nthan slight. See Notes\n18 and 27 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for\ninformation about\ncertain judicial,\nlitigation and\nregulatory\nproceedings.\nSignificant judgment\nis required in making\nthese estimates and\nour final liabilities\nmay ultimately be\nmaterially different.\nOur total estimated\nliability in respect\nof litigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nis determined on a\ncase-by-case basis and\nrepresents an estimate\nof probable losses\nafter considering,\namong other factors,\nthe progress of each\ncase, proceeding or\ninvestigation, our\nexperience and the\nexperience of others\nin similar cases,\nproceedings or\ninvestigations, and\nthe opinions and views\nof legal counsel.\n\nIn accounting for\nincome taxes, we\nrecognize tax\npositions in the\nfinancial statements\nonly when it is more\nlikely than not that\nthe position will be\nsustained on\nexamination by the\nrelevant taxing\nauthority based on the\ntechnical merits of\nthe position.

The increase in\noperating expenses compared with 2022\nprimarily reflected significantly higher\nimpairments related to commercial real estate\nwithin CIEs ($1.46 billion recognized in\n2023), a write-down of identifiable intangible\nassets of $506 million related to GreenSky and\nan impairment of goodwill of $504 million\nrelated to Consumer platforms (all in\ndepreciation and amortization), as well as the\nFDIC special assessment fee of $529 million\n(in other expenses).

As of December 2023,\nheadcount decreased 7% compared with December\n2022 , primarily reflecting a headcount\nreduction initiative during the year .\nProvision for Taxes The effective income tax\nrate for 2023 was 20.7%, up from the full year\nincome tax rate of 16.5% for 2022, primarily\nresulting from an increase in taxes on\nnon-U.S. earnings in 2023, partially offset by\nan increase in the impact of permanent tax\nbenefits for 2023 compared with 2022. In May\n2023, the New York State fiscal year 2024\nbudget was enacted. The legislation extends\nthe temporary increase in the New York State\ncorporate income tax rate from 6.5% to 7.25%\nthrough calendar year 2026. In December 2023,\nthe New York State Department of Taxation and\nFinance published final regulations that\nimplemented comprehensive franchise tax reform\nfor corporations, banks and insurance\ncompanies, which was enacted in 2014. The\nlegislation and final regulations did not have\na material impact on our 2023 annual effective\ntax rate and are not expected to have a\nmaterial impact on our 2024 annual effective\ntax rate. The Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) Global Anti-\nBase Erosion Model Rules (Pillar II) aim to\nensure that multinationals with revenues in\nexcess of EUR 750 million pay a minimum\neffective corporate tax rate of 15% in each\njurisdiction in which they operate. The U.K.\nand other jurisdictions in which we operate\nhave adopted certain portions of the OECD\ndirective (Pillar II legislation) effective\nbeginning in calendar year 2024. In February\n2023, the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard released guidance that it believes\nPillar II is an alternative minimum tax, and\ntherefore deferred tax assets and liabilities\nshould not be remeasured for its estimated\nfuture effects and any additional tax should\nbe recognized in the period incurred. We do\nnot expect the impact on our 2024 annual\neffective tax rate to be material. We expect\nour 2024 tax rate to be approximately 22%,\nincluding the impact of any Pillar II taxes,\nbased on our current interpretation of the\nguidance published by the OECD and enacted\nlegislation.\n                                      \n  70    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

During 2023,\nGlobal Banking & Markets operated in an\nenvironment generally characterized by\ncontinued broad macroeconomic concerns,\nincluding the outlook for economic growth and\ninflation, and elevated geopolitical stresses.\nThese factors weighed on industry-wide\ninvestment banking activity levels and market-\nmaking activity levels. In investment banking,\nindustry-wide completed mergers and\nacquisitions transactions declined compared\nwith elevated levels in the prior year, while\nindustry-wide equity and debt underwriting\nvolumes remained below historical averages. In\ninterest rates, the yields on 10-year U.S. and\nU.K government bonds increased during the\nmiddle of the year before declining to yields\nnear where they ended in 2022. In equities,\nthe S&P 500 Index increased by 24% and the\nMSCI World Index increased by 20% compared\nwith the end of 2022. In the future, if market\nand economic conditions deteriorate, and\nmarket-making activity levels decline further\nor investment banking activity levels decline\nfurther, or credit spreads related to hedges\non our relationship lending portfolio tighten,\nnet revenues in Global Banking & Markets would\nlikely be negatively impacted. In addition, if\neconomic conditions deteriorate further or if\nthe creditworthiness of borrowers\ndeteriorates, provision for credit losses\nwould likely be negatively impacted. 2023\nversus 2022. Net revenues in Global Banking &\nMarkets were $30.00 billion for 2023, 8% lower\nthan a strong 2022. Investment banking fees\nwere $6.22 billion, 16% lower than 2022, due\nto significantly lower net revenues in\nAdvisory, reflecting a significant decline in\nindustry-wide completed mergers and\nacquisitions transactions, and slightly lower\nnet revenues in Debt underwriting, partially\noffset by significantly higher net revenues in\nEquity underwriting, primarily reflecting\nincreased activity from secondary offerings.\nAs of December 2023, our Investment banking\nfees backlog decreased compared with the end\nof 2022, due to significantly lower estimated\nnet revenues from both potential equity\nunderwriting transactions (primarily from\ninitial public offerings) and potential debt\nunderwriting transactions (primarily from\nstructured finance offerings).\n                                      \n  74    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

During 2023, Asset &\nWealth Management operated in an environment\ngenerally characterized by continued broad\nmacroeconomic concerns, including pressure in\nthe commercial real estate market. However,\nimprovements in the outlook for economic\nconditions contributed to generally higher\nglobal equity and bond prices compared with\nthe end of 2022, positively affecting assets\nunder supervision. In the future, if market\nand economic conditions deteriorate, it may\nlead to a decline in asset prices, or\ninvestors transitioning to asset classes that\ntypically generate lower fees or withdrawing\ntheir assets, and net revenues in Asset &\nWealth Management would likely be negatively\nimpacted. 2023 ver sus 2022. Net revenues in\nAsset & Wealth Management were $13.88 billion\nfor 2023, 4% higher than 2022, reflecting\nhigher Management and other fees and higher\nnet revenues in Debt investments and Private\nbanking and lending, partially offset by\nsignificantly lower net revenues in Equity\ninvestments and significantly lower Incentive\nfees. The increase in Management and other\nfees primarily reflected the impact of higher\naverage assets under supervision, including\nthe impact of acquiring NNIP. The increase in\nDebt investments net revenues reflected\nsignificantly lower net mark-downs compared\nwith the prior year (despite a challenging\nenvironment for real estate investments in the\ncurrent year), partially offset by lower net\ninterest income due to a reduction in the debt\ninvestments balance sheet. The increase in\nPrivate banking and lending net revenues\nprimarily reflected higher deposit spreads and\nbalances, partially offset by the impact of\nthe sale of substantially all of the Marcus\nloans portfolio in the year. The decrease in\nEquity investments net revenues reflected\nsignificantly lower net gains from investments\nin private equities, primarily due to net\nlosses from real estate investments, partially\noffset by significantly lower net losses from\ninvestments in public equities. The decrease\nin Incentive fees was driven by more\nsignificant harvesting in the prior year.\nProvision for credit losses was a net benefit\nof $508 million for 2023, compared with a\nprovision of $519 million for 2022. The net\nbenefit for 2023 primarily reflected a reserve\nreduction of $442 million related to the sale\nof substantially all of the Marcus loans\nportfolio and lower balances in corporate\nloans due to sales and paydowns, partially\noffset by impairments. Provisions for 2022\nprimarily reflected the impact of\nmacroeconomic and geopolitical concerns .\nOperating expenses were $13.03 billion for\n2023, 13% higher than 2022, largely due to\nsignificantly higher impairments related to\ncommercial real estate within CIEs . Pre-tax\nearnings were $1.36 billion for 2023, 4%\nhigher than 2022.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    77  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In\nthe future, if\neconomic conditions\ndeteriorate, it may\nlead to a decrease in\nconsumer spending or a\ndeterioration in\nconsumer credit, and\nnet revenues and\nprovision for credit\nlosses in Platform\nSolutions would likely\nbe negatively\nimpacted. 2023 ve rsus\n2022.

We believe that our\nrelationships with our creditors are critical\nto our liquidity. Our creditors include banks,\ngovernments, securities lenders, corporations,\npension funds, insurance companies, mutual\nfunds and individuals. We have imposed various\ninternal guidelines to monitor creditor\nconcentration across our funding programs.\n\nDeposits. Our deposits provide us with a\ndiversified source of funding and reduce our\nreliance on wholesale funding. We raise\ndeposits, including savings, demand and time\ndeposits, from private bank clients,\nconsumers, transaction banking clients, other\ninstitutional clients, and through internal\nand third-party broker-dealers. Substantially\nall of our deposits are raised through Goldman\nSachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA), Goldman Sachs\nInternational Bank (GSIB) and Goldman Sachs\nBank Europe SE (GSBE). See Note 13 to the\nconsolidated financial statements for further\ninformation about our deposits, including a\nmaturity profile of our time deposits. Secured\nFunding. We fund a significant amount of\ninventory and a portion of investments on a\nsecured basis. Secured funding includes\ncollateralized financings in the consolidated\nbalance sheets. See Note 11 to the\nconsolidated financial statements for further\ninformation about our collateralized\nfinancings, including its maturity profile. We\nmay also pledge our inventory and investments\nas collateral for securities borrowed under a\nsecurities lending agreement. We also use our\nown inventory and investments to cover\ntransactions in which we or our clients have\nsold securities that have not yet been\npurchased. Secured funding is less sensitive\nto changes in our credit quality than\nunsecured funding, due to our posting of\ncollateral to our lenders. Nonetheless, we\nanalyze the refinancing risk of our secured\nfunding activities, taking into account trade\ntenors, maturity profiles, counterparty\nconcentrations, collateral eligibility and\ncounterparty rollover probabilities. We seek\nto mitigate our refinancing risk by executing\nterm trades with staggered maturities,\ndiversifying counterparties, raising excess\nsecured funding and pre-funding residual risk\nthrough our GCLA. We seek to raise secured\nfunding with a term appropriate for the\nliquidity of the assets that are being\nfinanced, and we seek longer maturities for\nsecured funding collateralized by asset\nclasses that may be harder to fund on a\nsecured basis, especially during times of\nmarket stress. Our secured funding, excluding\nfunding collateralized by liquid government\nand agency obligations, is primarily executed\nfor tenors of one month or greater and is\nprimarily executed through term repurchase\nagreements and securities loaned contracts.\nAssets that may be harder to fund on a secured\nbasis during times of market stress include\ncertain financial instruments in the following\ncategories: mortgage- and other asset-backed\nloans and securities, non-investment-grade\ncorporate debt securities, equity securities\nand emerging market securities. We also raise\nfinancing through other types of\ncollateralized financings, such as secured\nloans and notes. GS Bank USA has access to\nfunding from the Federal Home Loan Bank. We\nhad no outstanding borrowings from the Federal\nHome Loan Bank as of both December 2023 and\nDecember 2022. Additionally, we have access to\nfunding through the Federal Reserve discount\nwindow, but we do not rely on this funding in\nour liquidity planning and stress testing.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    85  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

To mitigate\nrefinancing risk, we seek to limit the\nprincipal amount of debt maturing over the\ncourse of any monthly, quarterly, semi-annual\nor annual time horizon. We enter into interest\nrate swaps to convert a portion of our\nunsecured long-term borrowings into floating-\nrate obligations to manage our exposure to\ninterest rates.

Shareholders\u2019 Equity.\nShareholders\u2019 equity is a stable and perpetual\nsource of funding. See Note 19 to the\nconsolidated financial statements for further\ninformation about our shareholders\u2019 equity.\n\nCapital Management and Regulatory Capital\nCapital adequacy is of critical importance to\nus. We have in place a comprehensive capital\nmanagement policy that provides a framework,\ndefines objectives and establishes guidelines\nto assist us in maintaining the appropriate\nlevel and composition of capital in both\nbusiness-as-usual and stressed conditions.\nCapital Management We determine the\nappropriate amount and composition of our\ncapital by considering multiple factors,\nincluding our current and future regulatory\ncapital requirements, the results of our\ncapital planning and stress testing process,\nthe results of resolution capital models and\nother factors, such as rating agency\nguidelines, subsidiary capital requirements,\nthe business environment and conditions in the\nfinancial markets. We manage our capital\nrequirements and the levels of our capital\nusage principally by setting limits on the\nbalance sheet and/or limits on risk, in each\ncase at both the firmwide and business levels.\nWe principally manage the level and\ncomposition of our capital through issuances\nand repurchases of our common stock. We may\nissue, redeem or repurchase our preferred\nstock and subordinated debt or other forms of\ncapital as business conditions warrant. Prior\nto such redemptions or repurchases, we must\nreceive approval from the FRB. See Notes 14\nand 19 to the consolidated financial\nstatements for further information about our\nsubordinated debt and preferred stock. Capital\nPlanning and Stress Testing Process. As part\nof capital planning, we project sources and\nuses of capital given a range of business\nenvironments, including stressed conditions.\nOur stress testing process is designed to\nidentify and measure material risks associated\nwith our business activities, including market\nrisk, credit risk, operational risk and\nliquidity risk, as well as our ability to\ngenerate revenues. Our capital planning\nprocess incorporates an internal capital\nadequacy assessment with the objective of\nensuring that we are appropriately capitalized\nrelative to the risks in our businesses. We\nincorporate stress scenarios into our capital\nplanning process with a goal of holding\nsufficient capital to ensure we remain\nadequately capitalized after experiencing a\nsevere stress event. Our assessment of capital\nadequacy is viewed in tandem with our\nassessment of liquidity adequacy and is\nintegrated into our overall risk management\nstructure, governance and policy framework.\n                                      \n  86    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\npurpose of the FRB\u2019s\nreview is to ensure\nthat we have a robust,\nforward-looking\ncapital planning\nprocess that accounts\nfor our unique risks\nand that permits\ncontinued operation\nduring times of\neconomic and financial\nstress.\n\nThe FRB evaluates us\nbased, in part, on\nwhether we have the\ncapital necessary to\ncontinue operating\nunder the baseline and\nseverely adverse\nscenarios provided by\nthe FRB and those\ndeveloped internally.\nThis evaluation also\ntakes into account our\nprocess for\nidentifying risk, our\ncontrols and\ngovernance for capital\nplanning, and our\nguidelines for making\ncapital planning\ndecisions. In\naddition, the FRB\nevaluates our plan to\nmake capital\ndistributions (i.e.,\ndividend payments and\nrepurchases or\nredemptions of stock,\nsubordinated debt or\nother capital\nsecurities) and issue\ncapital, across the\nrange of macroeconomic\nscenarios and firm-\nspecific assumptions.\nThe FRB determines the\nSCB applicable to us\nbased on its own\nannual stress test.\nThe SCB under the\nStandardized approach\nis calculated as (i)\nthe difference between\nour starting and\nminimum projected CET1\ncapital ratios under\nthe supe rvisory\nseverely adverse\nscenario and (ii) our\nplanned common stock\ndividends for each of\nthe fourth through\nseventh quarters of\nthe planning horizon,\nexpressed as a\npercentage of risk-\nweighted assets\n(RWAs).\n\nBased on our 2023 CCAR\nsubmission, the FRB\nreduced our SCB from\n6.3% to 5.5%,\nresulting in a\nStandardized CET1\ncapital ratio\nrequirement of 13.0%\nfor the period from\nOctober 1, 2023\nthrough September 30,\n2024.

As part of our\ncomprehensive capital\nmanagement policy, we\nmaintain a contingency\ncapital plan. Our\ncontingency capital\nplan provides a\nframework for\nanalyzing and\nresponding to a\nperceived or actual\ncapital deficiency,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to,\nidentification of\ndrivers of a capital\ndeficiency, as well as\nmitigants and\npotential actions. It\noutlines the\nappropriate\ncommunication\nprocedures to follow\nduring a crisis\nperiod, including\ninternal dissemination\nof information, as\nwell as timely\ncommunication with\nexternal stakeholders.\n\nCapital Attribution.\nWe assess the capital\nusage of each of our\nbusinesses based on\nour attributed equity\nframework. This\nframework considers\nmany factors,\nincluding our internal\nassessment of risks as\nwell as the regulatory\ncapital requirements\nrelated to our\nbusiness activities,\nwhich take into\nconsideration our\nbinding capital\nconstraints. Our\nbinding capital\nconstraints include\nour CET1 capital ratio\nrequirement under the\nStandardized Capital\nRules, which\nincorporates the SCB\nas determined by the\nFRB based on its own\nannual stress test.\n\nWe review and make any\nnecessary adjustments\nto our attributed\nequity in January each\nyear, to reflect,\namong other things,\nour most recent stress\ntest results and\nchanges to our\nregulatory capital\nrequirements. On\nJanuary 1, 2024, our\nallocation of\nattributed equity\nchanged (relative to\nthe allocation as of\nDecember 2023) as\nfollows: attributed\nequity increased by\napproximately $1.6\nbillion for Platform\nSolutions, while\nattributed equity\ndecreased by\napproximately $1.2\nbillion for Asset &\nWealth Management and\napproximately $0.4\nbillion for Global\nBanking & Markets.

We use our\nshare repurchase\nprogram to help\nmaintain the\nappropriate level of\ncommon equity. On an\nannual basis, we\nsubmit a Board of\nDirectors of Group\nInc. ( Board) approved\ncapital plan to the\nFederal Reserve, which\nincludes planned share\nrepurchases for each\nquarter. The share\nrepurchases are\neffected primarily\nthrough regular open-\nmarket purchases\n(which may include\nrepurchase plans\ndesigned to comply\nwith Rule 10b5-1 and\naccelerated share\nrepurchases), the\namounts and timing of\nwhich are determined\nprimarily by our\ncurrent and projected\ncapital position, and\ncapital deployment\nopportunities, but\nwhich may also be\ninfluenced by general\nmarket conditions and\nthe prevailing price\nand trading volumes of\nour common stock.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    87  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Given that\nmany of the new and\nproposed rules are\nhighly complex, the\nfull impact of\nregulatory reform will\nnot be known until the\nrules are implemented\nand market practices\ndevelop under the\nfinal regulations.

Off-\nBalance Sheet\nArrangements In the\nordinary course of\nbusiness, we enter\ninto various types of\noff-balance sheet\narrangements. Our\ninvolvement in these\narrangements can take\nmany different forms,\nincluding: \u2022\nPurchasing or\nretaining residual and\nother interests in\nspecial purpose\nentities, such as\nmortgage-backed and\nother asset-backed\nsecuritization\nvehicles; \u2022 Holding\nsenior and\nsubordinated debt,\ninterests in limited\nand general\npartnerships, and\npreferred and common\nstock in other\nnonconsolidated\nvehicles; \u2022 Entering\ninto interest rate,\nforeign currency,\nequity, commodity and\ncredit derivatives,\nincluding total return\nswaps; and \u2022 Providing\nguarantees,\nindemnifications,\ncommitments, letters\nof credit and\nrepresentations and\nwarranties. We enter\ninto these\narrangements for a\nvariety of business\npurposes, including\nsecuritizations. The\nsecuritization\nvehicles that purchase\nmortgages, corporate\nbonds and other types\nof financial assets\nare critical to the\nfunctioning of several\nsignificant investor\nmarkets, including the\nmortgage-backed and\nother asset-backed\nsecurities markets,\nsince they offer\ninvestors access to\nspecific cash flows\nand risks created\nthrough the\nsecuritization\nprocess.\n\nWe also enter into\nthese arrangements to\nunderwrite client\nsecuritization\ntransactions; provide\nsecondary market\nliquidity; make\ninvestments in\nperforming and\nnonperforming debt,\ndistressed loans,\npower-related assets,\nequity securities,\nreal estate and other\nassets; and provide\ninvestors with credit-\nlinked and asset-\nrepackaged notes.

Our risk\nmanagement structure\nis built around three\ncore components:\ngovernance, processes\nand people.\n\nGovernance. Risk\nmanagement governance\nstarts with the Board,\nwhich both directly\nand through its\ncommittees, including\nits Risk Committee,\noversees our risk\nmanagement policies\nand practices\nimplemented through\nthe enterprise risk\nmanagement framework.\nThe Board is also\nresponsible for the\nannual review and\napproval of our risk\nappetite statement.\nThe risk appetite\nstatement describes\nthe levels and types\nof risk we are willing\nto accept or to avoid\nin order to achieve\nour objectives\nincluded in our\nstrategic business\nplan, while remaining\nin compliance with\nregulatory\nrequirements. The\nBoard reviews our\nstrategic business\nplan and is ultimately\nresponsible for\noverseeing and\nproviding direction\nabout our strategy and\nrisk appetite.\n\nThe Board, including\nthrough its\ncommittees, receives\nregular briefings on\nfirmwide risks,\nincluding liquidity\nrisk, market risk,\ncredit risk,\noperational risk,\ncybersecurity risk,\nmodel risk and climate\nrisk, from our\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions, including\nour chief risk\nofficer, on\ncybersecurity threats\nand risks from our\nchief information\nsecurity officer\n(CISO), on compliance\nrisk and conduct risk\nfrom our chief\ncompliance officer, on\nlegal and regulatory\nenforcement matters\nfrom our chief legal\nofficer, and on other\nmatters impacting our\nreputation from the\nchair and/or vice-\nchairs of our Firmwide\nReputational Risk\nCommittee. The chief\nrisk officer reports\nto our chief executive\nofficer and to the\nRisk Committee of the\nBoard. As part of the\nreview of the firmwide\nrisk portfolio, the\nchief risk officer\nregularly advises the\nRisk Committee of the\nBoard of relevant risk\nmetrics and material\nexposures, including\nrisk limits and\nthresholds established\nin our risk appetite\nstatement.\n\nThe implementation of\nour risk governance\nstructure and core\nrisk management\nprocesses is overseen\nby Enterprise Risk,\nwhich reports to our\nchief risk officer,\nand is responsible for\nensuring that our\nenterprise risk\nmanagement framework\nprovides the Board,\nour risk committees\nand senior management\nwith a consistent and\nintegrated approach to\nmanaging our various\nrisks in a manner\nconsistent with our\nrisk appetite.\n\nOur revenue-producing\nunits, as well as\nTreasury, Engineering,\nHuman Capital\nManagement,\nOperations, and\nCorporate and\nWorkplace Solutions,\nare considered our\nfirst line of defense.\nThey are accountable\nfor the outcomes of\nour risk-generating\nactivities, as well as\nfor assessing and\nmanaging those risks\nwithin our risk\nappetite.\n\nOur independent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions are\nconsidered our second\nline of defense and\nprovide independent\nassessment, oversight\nand challenge of the\nrisks taken by our\nfirst line of defense,\nas well as lead and\nparticipate in risk\ncommittees.\nIndependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions include\nCompliance, Conflicts\nResolution,\nControllers, Legal,\nRisk and Tax.\n\nInternal Audit is\nconsidered our third\nline of defense, and\nour director of\nInternal Audit reports\nto the Audit Committee\nof the Board and\nadministratively to\nour chief executive\nofficer. Internal\nAudit includes\nprofessionals with a\nbroad range of audit\nand industry\nexperience, including\nrisk management\nexpertise. Internal\nAudit is responsible\nfor independently\nassessing and\nvalidating the\neffectiveness of key\ncontrols, including\nthose within the risk\nmanagement framework,\nand providing timely\nreporting to the Audit\nCommittee of the\nBoard, senior\nmanagement and\nregulators.\n                                      \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    93  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \nThe three lines of\ndefense structure\npromotes the\naccountability of\nfirst line risk\ntakers, provides a\nframework for\neffective challenge by\nthe second line and\nempowers independent\nreview from the third\nline.\n\nProcesses. We maintain\nvarious processes that\nare critical\ncomponents of our risk\nmanagement framework,\nincluding (i) risk\nidentification and\ncontrol assessment,\n(ii) risk appetite,\nlimits, thresholds and\nalerts setting, (iii)\nrisk metrics,\nreporting and\nmonitoring, and (iv)\nrisk decision-making.\n\n\u2022 Risk Identification\nand Control\nAssessment. We believe\nthe identification of\nour risks and related\ncontrol assessment is\na critical step in\nproviding our Board\nand senior management\ntransparency and\ninsight into the range\nand materiality of our\nrisks. We have a\ncomprehensive data\ncollection process,\nincluding firmwide\npolicies and\nprocedures that\nrequire all employees\nto report and escalate\nrisk events. Our\napproach for risk\nidentification and\ncontrol assessment is\ncomprehensive across\nall risk types, is\ndynamic and forward-\nlooking to reflect and\nadapt to our changing\nrisk profile and\nbusiness environment,\nleverages subject\nmatter expertise, and\nallows for\nprioritization of our\nmost critical risks.\nThis approach also\nencompasses our\ncontrol assessment,\nled by our second line\nof defense, to review\nand challenge the\ncontrol environment to\nhelp ensure it\nsupports our strategic\nbusiness plan.\n\nTo effectively assess\nour risks, we maintain\na daily discipline of\nmarking substantially\nall of our inventory\nto current market\nlevels. We carry our\ninventory at fair\nvalue, with changes in\nvaluation reflected\nimmediately in our\nrisk management\nsystems and in net\nrevenues. We do so\nbecause we believe\nthis discipline is one\nof the most effective\ntools for assessing\nand managing risk and\nthat it provides\ntransparent and\nrealistic insight into\nour inventory\nexposures.\n\nAn important part of\nour risk management\nprocess is firmwide\nstress testing. It\nallows us to quantify\nour exposure to tail\nrisks, highlight\npotential loss\nconcentrations,\nundertake risk/reward\nanalysis, and assess\nand mitigate our risk\npositions. Firmwide\nstress tests are\nperformed on a regular\nbasis and are designed\nto ensure a\ncomprehensive analysis\nof our vulnerabilities\nand idiosyncratic\nrisks combining\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial risks,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, credit,\nmarket, liquidity and\nfunding, operational\nand compliance,\nclimate, strategic,\nsystemic and emerging\nrisks into a single\ncombined scenario. We\nalso perform ad hoc\nstress tests in\nanticipation of market\nevents or conditions.\nStress tests are also\nused to assess capital\nadequacy as part of\nour capital planning\nand stress testing\nprocess. See \u201cCapital\nManagement and\nRegulatory Capital \u2014\nCapital Management\u201d\nfor further\ninformation.\n\n\u2022 Risk Appetite,\nLimits, Thresholds and\nAlerts Setting. We\napply a framework of\nlimits and thresholds\nto control and monitor\nrisk across\ntransactions,\nproducts, businesses\nand markets. The\nBoard, directly or\nindirectly through its\nRisk Committee,\napproves limits,\nthresholds and alerts\nincluded in our risk\nappetite statement at\nfirmwide, business and\nproduct levels. In\naddition, the Firmwide\nRisk Appetite\nCommittee, through\ndelegated authority\nfrom the Firmwide\nEnterprise Risk\nCommittee, is\nresponsible for\napproving our risk\nlimits, thresholds and\nalerts policy, subject\nto the overall limits\napproved by the Risk\nCommittee of the\nBoard, and monitoring\nthese limits.\n\nThe Firmwide Risk\nAppetite Committee is\nresponsible for\napproving limits at\nfirmwide, business and\nproduct levels.\nCertain limits may be\nset at levels that\nwill require periodic\nadjustment, rather\nthan at levels that\nreflect our maximum\nrisk appetite. This\nfosters an ongoing\ndialogue about risk\namong our first and\nsecond lines of\ndefense, committees\nand senior management,\nas well as rapid\nescalation of risk-\nrelated matters.\nAdditionally, through\ndelegated authority\nfrom the Firmwide Risk\nAppetite Committee,\nMarket Risk sets\nlimits at certain\nproduct and desk\nlevels, and Credit\nRisk sets limits for\nindividual\ncounterparties and\ntheir subsidiaries,\nindustries and\ncountries. Limits are\nreviewed regularly and\namended on a permanent\nor temporary basis to\nreflect changes to our\nstrategic business\nplan, as well as\nchanging market\nconditions, business\nconditions or risk\ntolerance.\n\n\u2022 Risk Metrics,\nReporting and\nMonitoring. Effective\nrisk reporting and\nrisk decision-making\ndepends on our ability\nto get the right\ninformation to the\nright people at the\nright time. As such,\nwe focus on the rigor\nand effectiveness of\nour risk systems, with\nthe objective of\nensuring that our risk\nmanagement technology\nsystems provide us\nwith complete,\naccurate and timely\ninformation. Our risk\nmetrics, reporting and\nmonitoring processes\nare designed to take\ninto account\ninformation about both\nexisting and emerging\nrisks, thereby\nenabling our risk\ncommittees and senior\nmanagement to perform\ntheir responsibilities\nwith the appropriate\nlevel of insight into\nrisk exposures.\nFurthermore, our limit\nand threshold breach\nprocesses provide\nmeans for timely\nescalation. We\nevaluate changes in\nour risk profile and\nour businesses,\nincluding changes in\nbusiness mix or\njurisdictions in which\nwe operate, by\nmonitoring risk\nfactors at a firmwide\nlevel.\n                                      \n  94    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \n\u2022 Risk Decision-\nMaking. Our governance\nstructure provides the\nprotocol and\nresponsibility for\ndecision-making on\nrisk management issues\nand is designed to\nensure implementation\nof those decisions. We\nmake extensive use of\nrisk committees that\nmeet regularly and\nserve as an important\nmeans to facilitate\nand foster ongoing\ndiscussions to manage\nand mitigate risks.\n\nWe maintain strong and\nproactive\ncommunication about\nrisk and we have a\nculture of\ncollaboration in\ndecision-making among\nour first and second\nlines of defense,\ncommittees and senior\nmanagement. While our\nfirst line of defense\nis responsible for\nmanagement of their\nrisk, we dedicate\nextensive resources to\nour second line of\ndefense in order to\nensure a strong\noversight structure\nand an appropriate\nsegregation of duties.\nWe regularly reinforce\nour strong culture of\nescalation and\naccountability across\nall functions.\n\nPeople. Even the best\ntechnology serves only\nas a tool for helping\nto make informed\ndecisions in real time\nabout the risks we are\ntaking. Ultimately,\neffective risk\nmanagement requires\nour people to\ninterpret our risk\ndata on an ongoing and\ntimely basis and\nadjust risk positions\naccordingly. The\nexperience of our\nprofessionals, and\ntheir understanding of\nthe nuances and\nlimitations of each\nrisk measure, guides\nus in assessing\nexposures and\nmaintaining them\nwithin prudent levels.\n\nWe reinforce a culture\nof effective risk\nmanagement, consistent\nwith our risk\nappetite, in our\ntraining and\ndevelopment programs,\nas well as in the way\nwe evaluate\nperformance, and\nrecognize and reward\nour people. Our\ntraining and\ndevelopment programs,\nincluding certain\nsessions led by our\nmost senior leaders,\nare focused on the\nimportance of risk\nmanagement, client\nrelationships and\nreputational\nexcellence. As part of\nour performance review\nprocess, we assess\nreputational\nexcellence, including\nhow an employee\nexercises good risk\nmanagement and\nreputational judgment,\nand adheres to our\ncode of conduct and\ncompliance policies.\nOur review and reward\nprocesses are designed\nto communicate and\nreinforce to our\nprofessionals the link\nbetween behavior and\nhow people are\nrecognized, the need\nto focus on our\nclients and our\nreputation, and the\nneed to always act in\naccordance with our\nhighest standards.\n                                              \n  Structure                                   \n                                              \nUltimate oversight of\nrisk is the\nresponsibility of our\nBoard. The Board\noversees risk both\ndirectly and through\nits committees,\nincluding its Risk\nCommittee. We also\nhave a series of\ncommittees that\ngenerally consist of\nsenior managers from\nboth our first and\nsecond lines of\ndefense, with specific\nrisk management\nmandates that have\noversight or decision-\nmaking\nresponsibilities for\nrisk management\nactivities. We have\nestablished procedures\nfor these committees\nso that appropriate\ninformation barriers\nare in place. Our\nprimary risk\ncommittees, most of\nwhich also have\nadditional sub-\ncommittees, councils\nor working groups, are\ndescribed below. In\naddition to these\ncommittees, we have\nother risk committees\nthat provide oversight\nfor different\nbusinesses,\nactivities, products,\nregions and entities.\nAll of our committees\nhave responsibility\nfor considering the\nimpact on our\nreputation of the\ntransactions and\nactivities that they\noversee.\n\nMembership of our risk\ncommittees is reviewed\nregularly and updated\nto reflect changes in\nthe responsibilities\nof the committee\nmembers. Accordingly,\nthe length of time\nthat members serve on\nthe respective\ncommittees varies as\ndetermined by the\ncommittee chairs and\nbased on the\nresponsibilities of\nthe members.\n\nThe chart below\npresents an overview\nof our risk management\ngovernance structure.\n\nManagement Committee.\nThe Management\nCommittee oversees our\nglobal activities. It\nprovides this\noversight directly and\nthrough authority\ndelegated to\ncommittees it has\nestablished. This\ncommittee consists of\nour most senior\nleaders, and is\nchaired by our chief\nexecutive officer.\nMost members of the\nManagement Committee\nare also members of\nother committees.

The\nFirmwide Enterprise\nRisk Committee is\nresponsible for\noverseeing all of our\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial risks. As\npart of such\noversight, the\ncommittee is\nresponsible for the\nongoing review,\napproval and\nmonitoring of our\nenterprise risk\nmanagement framework,\nas well as our risk\nlimits, and thresholds\nand alerts policy,\nthrough delegated\nauthority to the\nFirmwide Risk Appetite\nCommittee. The\nFirmwide Enterprise\nRisk Committee also\nreviews new\nsignificant strategic\nbusiness initiatives\nto determine whether\nthey are consistent\nwith our risk appetite\nand risk management\ncapabilities.\nAdditionally, the\nFirmwide Enterprise\nRisk Committee\nperforms enhanced\nreviews of significant\nrisk events, the top\nresidual and emerging\nrisks, and the overall\nrisk and control\nenvironment in each of\nour business units in\norder to propose\nuplifts, identify\nelements that are\ncommon to all business\nunits and analyze the\nconsolidated residual\nrisks that we face.\nThis committee, which\nreports to the\nManagement Committee,\nis co-chaired by our\npresident and chief\noperating officer and\nour chief risk\nofficer, who are\nappointed as chairs by\nour chief executive\nofficer, and the vice-\nchair is our chief\nfinancial officer, who\nis appointed as vice-\nchair by the chairs of\nthe Firmwide\nEnterprise Risk\nCommittee.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \nGCLA. GCLA is\nliquidity that we\nmaintain to meet a\nbroad range of\npotential cash\noutflows and\ncollateral needs in a\nstressed environment.\nA primary liquidity\nprinciple is to pre-\nfund our estimated\npotential cash and\ncollateral needs\nduring a liquidity\ncrisis and hold this\nliquidity in the form\nof unencumbered,\nhighly liquid\nsecurities and cash.\nWe believe that the\nsecurities held in our\nGCLA would be readily\nconvertible to cash in\na matter of days,\nthrough liquidation,\nby entering into\nrepurchase agreements\nor from maturities of\nresale agreements, and\nthat this cash would\nallow us to meet\nimmediate obligations\nwithout needing to\nsell other assets or\ndepend on additional\nfunding from credit-\nsensitive markets.\n\nOur GCLA reflects the\nfollowing principles:\n\n\u2022 The first days or\nweeks of a liquidity\ncrisis are the most\ncritical to a\ncompany\u2019s survival;\n\n\u2022 Focus must be\nmaintained on all\npotential cash and\ncollateral outflows,\nnot just disruptions\nto financing flows.\nOur businesses are\ndiverse, and our\nliquidity needs are\ndetermined by many\nfactors, including\nmarket movements,\ncollateral\nrequirements and\nclient commitments,\nall of which can\nchange dramatically in\na difficult funding\nenvironment;\n\n\u2022 During a liquidity\ncrisis, credit-\nsensitive funding,\nincluding unsecured\ndebt, certain deposits\nand some types of\nsecured financing\nagreements, may be\nunavailable, and the\nterms (e.g., interest\nrates, collateral\nprovisions and tenor)\nor availability of\nother types of secured\nfinancing may change\nand certain deposits\nmay be withdrawn; and\n\n\u2022 As a result of our\npolicy to pre-fund\nliquidity that we\nestimate may be needed\nin a crisis, we hold\nmore unencumbered\nsecurities and have\nlarger funding\nbalances than our\nbusinesses would\notherwise require. We\nbelieve that our\nliquidity is stronger\nwith greater balances\nof highly liquid\nunencumbered\nsecurities, even\nthough it increases\nour total assets and\nour funding costs.\n\nWe maintain our GCLA\nacross Group Inc.,\nGoldman Sachs Funding\nLLC (Funding IHC) and\nGroup Inc.\u2019s major\nbroker-dealer and bank\nsubsidiaries, asset\ntypes and clearing\nagents with the goal\nof providing us with\nsufficient operating\nliquidity to ensure\ntimely settlement in\nall major markets,\neven in a difficult\nfunding environment.\nIn addition to the\nGCLA, we maintain cash\nbalances and\nsecurities in several\nof our other entities,\nprimarily for use in\nspecific currencies,\nentities or\njurisdictions where we\ndo not have immediate\naccess to parent\ncompany liquidity.\n\nAsset-Liability\nManagement. Our\nliquidity risk\nmanagement policies\nare designed to ensure\nwe have a sufficient\namount of financing,\neven when funding\nmarkets experience\npersistent stress. We\nmanage the maturities\nand diversity of our\nfunding across\nmarkets, products and\ncounterparties, and\nseek to maintain a\ndiversified funding\nprofile with an\nappropriate tenor,\ntaking into\nconsideration the\ncharacteristics and\nliquidity profile of\nour assets.\n\nOur approach to asset-\nliability management\nincludes:\n\n\u2022 Conservatively\nmanaging the overall\ncharacteristics of our\nfunding book, with a\nfocus on maintaining\nlong-term, diversified\nsources of funding in\nexcess of our current\nrequirements. See\n\u201cBalance Sheet and\nFunding Sources \u2014\nFunding Sources\u201d for\nfurther information;\n\n\u2022 Actively managing\nand monitoring our\nasset base, with\nparticular focus on\nthe liquidity, holding\nperiod and ability to\nfund assets on a\nsecured basis. We\nassess our funding\nrequirements and our\nability to liquidate\nassets in a stressed\nenvironment while\nappropriately managing\nrisk. This enables us\nto determine the most\nappropriate funding\nproducts and tenors.\nSee \u201cBalance Sheet and\nFunding Sources \u2014\nBalance Sheet\nManagement\u201d for\nfurther information\nabout our balance\nsheet management\nprocess and \u201c\u2014 Funding\nSources \u2014 Secured\nFunding\u201d for further\ninformation about\nasset classes that may\nbe harder to fund on a\nsecured basis; and\n\n\u2022 Raising secured and\nunsecured financing\nthat has a long tenor\nrelative to the\nliquidity profile of\nour assets. This\nreduces the risk that\nour liabilities will\ncome due in advance of\nour ability to\ngenerate liquidity\nfrom the sale of our\nassets. Because we\nmaintain a highly\nliquid balance sheet,\nthe holding period of\ncertain of our assets\nmay be materially\nshorter than their\ncontractual maturity\ndates.\n\nOur goal is to ensure\nthat we maintain\nsufficient liquidity\nto fund our assets and\nmeet our contractual\nand contingent\nobligations in normal\ntimes, as well as\nduring periods of\nmarket stress. Through\nour dynamic balance\nsheet management\nprocess, we use actual\nand projected asset\nbalances to determine\nsecured and unsecured\nfunding requirements.\nFunding plans are\nreviewed and approved\nby the Firmwide Asset\nLiability Committee.\nIn addition, our\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions analyze, and\nthe Firmwide Asset\nLiability Committee\nreviews, our total\nunsecured long-term\nborrowings and total\nshareholders\u2019 equity\nto help ensure that we\nmaintain a level of\nlong-term funding that\nis sufficient to meet\nour long-term\nfinancing\nrequirements. In a\nliquidity crisis, we\nwould begin by\nliquidating and\nmonetizing our GCLA\nbefore selling other\nassets. However, we\nrecognize that orderly\nasset sales may be\nprudent or necessary\nin a severe or\npersistent liquidity\ncrisis.\n                                      \n  98    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                      \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In\naddition, Group Inc.\nprovides its regulated\nsubsidiaries with the\nnecessary capital to\nmeet their regulatory\nrequirements. The\nbenefits of this\napproach to subsidiary\nfunding are enhanced\ncontrol and greater\nflexibility to meet\nthe funding\nrequirements of our\nsubsidiaries. Funding\nis also raised at the\nsubsidiary level\nthrough a variety of\nproducts, including\ndeposits, secured\nfunding and unsecured\nborrowings.\n\nOur intercompany\nfunding policies\nassume that a\nsubsidiary\u2019s funds or\nsecurities are not\nfreely available to\nits parent, Funding\nIHC or other\nsubsidiaries unless\n(i) legally provided\nfor and (ii) there are\nno additional\nregulatory, tax or\nother restrictions. In\nparticular, many of\nour subsidiaries are\nsubject to laws that\nauthorize regulatory\nbodies to block or\nreduce the flow of\nfunds from those\nsubsidiaries to Group\nInc. or Funding IHC.\nRegulatory action of\nthat kind could impede\naccess to funds that\nGroup Inc. needs to\nmake payments on its\nobligations.\nAccordingly, we assume\nthat the capital\nprovided to our\nregulated subsidiaries\nis not available to\nGroup Inc. or other\nsubsidiaries and any\nother financing\nprovided to our\nregulated subsidiaries\nis not available to\nGroup Inc. or Funding\nIHC until the maturity\nof such financing.\n\nGroup Inc. has\nprovided substantial\namounts of equity and\nsubordinated\nindebtedness, directly\nor indirectly, to its\nregulated\nsubsidiaries. For\nexample, as of\nDecember 2023, Group\nInc. had $36.58\nbillion of equity and\nsubordinated\nindebtedness invested\nin GS&Co., its\nprincipal U.S.\nregistered broker-\ndealer; $47.17 billion\ninvested in GSI, a\nregulated U.K. broker-\ndealer; $2.44 billion\ninvested in GSJCL, a\nregulated Japanese\nbroker-dealer; $56.91\nbillion invested in GS\nBank USA, a regulated\nNew York State-\nchartered bank; and\n$4.80 billion invested\nin GSIB, a regulated\nU.K. bank. Group Inc.\nalso provides\nfinancing, directly or\nindirectly, in the\nform of: $137.58\nbillion of\nunsubordinated loans\n(including secured\nloans of $40.47\nbillion) and $35.60\nbillion of collateral\nand cash deposits to\nthese entities as of\nDecember 2023. In\naddition, as of\nDecember 2023, Group\nInc. had significant\namounts of capital\ninvested in and loans\nto its other regulated\nsubsidiaries.\n\nContingency Funding\nPlan. We maintain a\ncontingency funding\nplan to provide a\nframework for\nanalyzing and\nresponding to a\nliquidity crisis\nsituation or periods\nof market stress. Our\ncontingency funding\nplan outlines a list\nof potential risk\nfactors, key reports\nand metrics that are\nreviewed on an ongoing\nbasis to assist in\nassessing the severity\nof, and managing\nthrough, a liquidity\ncrisis and/or market\ndislocation. The\ncontingency funding\nplan also describes in\ndetail our potential\nresponses if our\nassessments indicate\nthat we have entered a\nliquidity crisis,\nwhich include pre-\nfunding for what we\nestimate will be our\npotential cash and\ncollateral needs, as\nwell as utilizing\nsecondary sources of\nliquidity. Mitigants\nand action items to\naddress specific risks\nwhich may arise are\nalso described and\nassigned to\nindividuals\nresponsible for\nexecution.\n\nThe contingency\nfunding plan\nidentifies key groups\nof individuals and\ntheir\nresponsibilities,\nwhich include\nfostering effective\ncoordination, control\nand distribution of\ninformation,\nimplementing liquidity\nmaintenance activities\nand managing internal\nand external\ncommunication, all of\nwhich are critical in\nthe management of a\ncrisis or period of\nmarket stress.\nStress Tests\nIn order to determine\nthe appropriate size\nof our GCLA, we model\nliquidity outflows\nover a range of\nscenarios and time\nhorizons. One of our\nprimary internal\nliquidity risk models,\nreferred to as the\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow, quantifies\nour liquidity risks\nover a 30-day stress\nscenario. We also\nconsider other\nfactors, including,\nbut not limited to, an\nassessment of our\npotential intraday\nliquidity needs\nthrough an additional\ninternal liquidity\nrisk model, referred\nto as the Intraday\nLiquidity Model, the\nresults of our long-\nterm stress testing\nmodels, our resolution\nliquidity models and\nother applicable\nregulatory\nrequirements and a\nqualitative assessment\nof our condition, as\nwell as the financial\nmarkets. The results\nof the Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow, the\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel, the long-term\nstress testing models\nand the resolution\nliquidity models are\nreported to senior\nmanagement on a\nregular basis.

Our Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow is\nbased on conducting\nmultiple scenarios\nthat include\ncombinations of\nmarket-wide and firm-\nspecific stress. These\nscenarios are\ncharacterized by the\nfollowing qualitative\nelements:\n\n\u2022 Severely challenged\nmarket environments,\nwhich include low\nconsumer and corporate\nconfidence, financial\nand political\ninstability, and\nadverse changes in\nmarket values,\nincluding potential\ndeclines in equity\nmarkets and widening\nof credit spreads; and\n\n\u2022 A firm-specific\ncrisis potentially\ntriggered by material\nlosses, reputational\ndamage (including, as\na result of, the\ndissemination of\nnegative information\nthrough social media),\nlitigation and/or a\nratings downgrade.\n\nThe following are key\nmodeling elements of\nour Modeled Liquidity\nOutflow:\n\n\u2022 Liquidity needs over\na 30-day scenario;\n\n\u2022 A two-notch\ndowngrade of our long-\nterm senior unsecured\ncredit ratings;\n\n\u2022 Changing conditions\nin funding markets,\nwhich limit our access\nto unsecured and\nsecured funding;\n\n\u2022 No support from\nadditional government\nfunding facilities.\nAlthough we have\naccess to various\ncentral bank funding\nprograms, we do not\nassume reliance on\nadditional sources of\nfunding in a liquidity\ncrisis; and\n\n\u2022 A combination of\ncontractual outflows\nand contingent\noutflows arising from\nboth our on- and off-\nbalance sheet\narrangements.\nContractual outflows\ninclude, among other\nthings, upcoming\nmaturities of\nunsecured debt, term\ndeposits and secured\nfunding. Contingent\noutflows include,\namong other things,\nthe withdrawal of\ncustomer credit\nbalances in our prime\nbrokerage business,\nincrease in variation\nmargin requirements\ndue to adverse changes\nin the value of our\nexchange-traded and\nOTC-cleared\nderivatives, draws on\nunfunded commitments\nand withdrawals of\ndeposits that have no\ncontractual maturity.\nSee notes to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about\ncontractual outflows,\nincluding Note 11 for\ncollateralized\nfinancings, Note 13\nfor deposits, Note 14\nfor unsecured long-\nterm borrowings and\nNote 15 for operating\nlease payments, and\n\u201cOff-Balance Sheet\nArrangements\u201d for\nfurther information\nabout our various\ntypes of off-balance\nsheet arrangements.\n\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel. Our Intraday\nLiquidity Model\nmeasures our intraday\nliquidity needs in a\nscenario where access\nto sources of intraday\nliquidity may become\nconstrained. The\nintraday liquidity\nmodel considers a\nvariety of factors,\nincluding historical\nsettlement activity.\n\nLong-Term Stress\nTesting. We utilize\nlonger-term stress\ntests to take a\nforward view on our\nliquidity position\nthrough prolonged\nstress periods in\nwhich we experience a\nsevere liquidity\nstress and recover in\nan environment that\ncontinues to be\nchallenging. We are\nfocused on ensuring\nconservative asset-\nliability management\nto prepare for a\nprolonged period of\npotential stress,\nseeking to maintain a\ndiversified funding\nprofile with an\nappropriate tenor,\ntaking into\nconsideration the\ncharacteristics and\nliquidity profile of\nour assets.\n\nResolution Liquidity\nModels. In connection\nwith our resolution\nplanning efforts, we\nhave established our\nResolution Liquidity\nAdequacy and\nPositioning framework,\nwhich estimates\nliquidity needs of our\nmajor subsidiaries in\na stressed\nenvironment. The\nliquidity needs are\nmeasured using our\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow assumptions\nand include certain\nadditional inter-\naffiliate exposures.\nWe have also\nestablished our\nResolution Liquidity\nExecution Need\nframework, which\nmeasures the liquidity\nneeds of our major\nsubsidiaries to\nstabilize and wind\ndown following a Group\nInc. bankruptcy filing\nin accordance with our\npreferred resolution\nstrategy.\n\nIn addition, we have\nestablished a triggers\nand alerts framework,\nwhich is designed to\nprovide the Board with\ninformation needed to\nmake an informed\ndecision on whether\nand when to commence\nbankruptcy proceedings\nfor Group Inc.\n                                              \n  Limits                                      \n                                              \nWe use liquidity risk\nlimits at various\nlevels and across\nliquidity risk types\nto manage the size of\nour liquidity\nexposures.

We\nmaintain our GCLA to\nenable us to meet\ncurrent and potential\nliquidity requirements\nof our parent company,\nGroup Inc., and its\nsubsidiaries. Our\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow and Intraday\nLiquidity Model\nincorporate a\nrequirement for Group\nInc., as well as a\nstandalone requirement\nfor each of our major\nbroker-dealer and bank\nsubsidiaries. Funding\nIHC is required to\nprovide the necessary\nliquidity to Group\nInc. during the\nordinary course of\nbusiness, and is also\nobligated to provide\ncapital and liquidity\nsupport to major\nsubsidiaries in the\nevent of our material\nfinancial distress or\nfailure.

Inherent\nlimitations to VaR\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 VaR does not\nestimate potential\nlosses over longer\ntime horizons where\nmoves may be extreme;\n\n\u2022 VaR does not take\naccount of the\nrelative liquidity of\ndifferent risk\npositions; and\n\n\u2022 Previous moves in\nmarket risk factors\nmay not produce\naccurate predictions\nof all future market\nmoves.\n\nTo comprehensively\ncapture our exposures\nand relevant risks in\nour VaR calculation,\nwe use historical\nsimulations with full\nvaluation of market\nfactors at the\nposition level by\nsimultaneously\nshocking the relevant\nmarket factors for\nthat position. These\nmarket factors include\nspot prices, credit\nspreads, funding\nspreads, yield curves,\nvolatility and\ncorrelation, and are\nupdated periodically\nbased on changes in\nthe composition of\npositions, as well as\nvariations in market\nconditions. We sample\nfrom five years of\nhistorical data to\ngenerate the scenarios\nfor our VaR\ncalculation. The\nhistorical data is\nweighted so that the\nrelative importance of\nthe data reduces over\ntime. This gives\ngreater importance to\nmore recent\nobservations and\nreflects current asset\nvolatilities, which\nimproves the accuracy\nof our estimates of\npotential loss. As a\nresult, even if our\npositions included in\nVaR were unchanged,\nour VaR would increase\nwith increasing market\nvolatility and vice\nversa.\n\nGiven its reliance on\nhistorical data, VaR\nis most effective in\nestimating risk\nexposures in markets\nin which there are no\nsudden fundamental\nchanges or shifts in\nmarket conditions.\n\nOur VaR measure does\nnot include:\n\n\u2022 Positions that are\nnot accounted for at\nfair value, such as\nheld-to-maturity\nsecurities and loans,\ndeposits and unsecured\nborrowings that are\naccounted for at\namortized cost;\n\n\u2022 Available-for-sale\nsecurities for which\nthe related unrealized\nfair value gains and\nlosses are included in\naccumulated other\ncomprehensive\nincome/(loss);\n\n\u2022 Positions that are\nbest measured and\nmonitored using\nsensitivity measures;\nand\n\n\u2022 The impact of\nchanges in\ncounterparty and our\nown credit spreads on\nderivatives, as well\nas changes in our own\ncredit spreads on\nfinancial liabilities\nfor which the fair\nvalue option was\nelected.\n\nWe perform daily\nbacktesting of our VaR\nmodel (i.e., comparing\ndaily net revenues for\npositions included in\nVaR to the VaR measure\ncalculated as of the\nprior business day) at\nthe firmwide level and\nfor each of our\nbusinesses and major\nregulated\nsubsidiaries.\n\nEarnings-at-Risk. We\nmanage our interest\nrate risk using the\nEaR metric. EaR\nmeasures the estimated\nimpact of changes in\ninterest rates to our\nnet revenues and\npreferred stock\ndividends over a\ndefined time horizon.\nEaR complements the\nVaR metric, which\nmeasures the impact of\ninterest rate changes\nthat have an immediate\nimpact on the fair\nvalues of our assets\nand liabilities (i.e.,\nmark-to-market\nchanges). Our exposure\nto interest rate risk\noccurs due to a\nvariety of factors,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to:\n\n\u2022 Differences in\nmaturity or repricing\ndates of assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock and certain off-\nbalance sheet\ninstruments.\n\n\u2022 Differences in the\namounts of assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock and certain off-\nbalance sheet\ninstruments with the\nsame maturity or\nrepricing dates.\n\n\u2022 Certain interest\nrate sensitive fees.\n\nTreasury manages the\naggregated interest\nrate risk from all\nbusinesses using our\ninvestment securities\nportfolio and interest\nrate derivatives. We\nmeasure EaR over a\none-year time horizon\nfollowing a 100- and\n200-basis point\ninstantaneous parallel\nshock in both short-\nand long-term interest\nrates. This\nsensitivity is\ncalculated relative to\na baseline market\nscenario, which takes\ninto consideration,\namong other things,\nthe market\u2019s\nexpectation of forward\nrates, as well as our\nexpectation of future\nbusiness activity.\nThese scenarios\ninclude contractual\nelements of assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock, and certain\noff-balance sheet\ninstruments, such as\nrates of interest,\nprincipal repayment\nschedules, maturity\nand reset dates, and\nany interest rate\nceilings or floors, as\nwell as assumptions\nwith respect to our\nbalance sheet size and\ncomposition,\nprepayment behavior\nand deposit repricing.\nDeposit repricing is\ncaptured by evaluating\nthe change in deposit\nrate paid relative to\nthe change in market\nrates (deposit beta)\nand we calibrate the\ndeposit betas used in\nour models by using a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding observed\nhistorical behavior,\nfuture expectations,\nfunding needs and the\ncompetitive landscape.\nWe continuously\nmonitor the\nperformance of our key\nassumptions against\nobserved behavior and\nregularly review their\nsensitivity on our\nrisk metrics.\n\nWe manage EaR with a\ngoal to reduce\npotential volatility\nresulting from changes\nin interest rates so\nit remains within our\nEaR risk appetite. Our\nEaR scenario is\nregularly evaluated\nand updated, if\nnecessary, to reflect\nchanges in our\nbusiness plans, market\nconditions and other\nmacroeconomic factors.\nWhile management uses\nthe best information\navailable to estimate\nEaR, actual results\nmay differ materially\nas a result of, among\nother things, changes\nin the economic\nenvironment or\nassumptions used in\nthe process. We also\nmeasure the\nsensitivity of the\neconomic value of our\nequity (EVE) to\nchanges in interest\nrates. Compared to\nEaR, EVE provides a\nlonger-term\nmeasurement of the\ninterest rate risk\nexposure, primarily on\nnon-trading assets and\nliabilities, by\ncapturing the net\nimpact of changes in\ninterest rates to the\npresent value of their\ncash flows.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    105  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Stress\nTesting. Stress\ntesting is a method of\ndetermining the effect\nof various\nhypothetical stress\nscenarios. In addition\nto EaR, we use other\nstress tests to\nexamine risks of\nspecific portfolios,\nas well as the\npotential impact of\nour significant risk\nexposures. We use a\nvariety of stress\ntesting techniques to\ncalculate the\npotential loss from a\nwide range of market\nmoves on our\nportfolios, including\nfirmwide stress tests,\nsensitivity analysis\nand scenario analysis.\nThe results of our\nvarious stress tests\nare analyzed together\nfor risk management\npurposes. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about\nfirmwide stress tests.\nSensitivity analysis\nis used to quantify\nthe impact of a market\nmove in a single risk\nfactor across all\npositions (e.g.,\nequity prices or\ncredit spreads) using\na variety of defined\nmarket shocks, ranging\nfrom those that could\nbe expected over a\none-day time horizon\nup to those that could\ntake many months to\noccur. We also use\nsensitivity analysis\nto quantify the impact\nof the default of any\nsingle entity, which\ncaptures the risk of\nlarge or concentrated\nexposures. Scenario\nanalysis is used to\nquantify the impact of\na specified event,\nincluding how the\nevent impacts multiple\nrisk factors\nsimultaneously. For\nexample, for sovereign\nstress testing we\ncalculate potential\ndirect exposure\nassociated with our\nsovereign positions,\nas well as the\ncorresponding debt,\nequity and currency\nexposures associated\nwith our non-sovereign\npositions that may be\nimpacted by the\nsovereign distress.\nWhen conducting\nscenario analysis, we\noften consider a\nnumber of possible\noutcomes for each\nscenario, ranging from\nmoderate to severely\nadverse market\nimpacts. In addition,\nthese stress tests are\nconstructed using both\nhistorical events and\nforward-looking\nhypothetical\nscenarios. Unlike VaR\nmeasures, which have\nan implied probability\nbecause they are\ncalculated at a\nspecified confidence\nlevel, there may not\nbe an implied\nprobability that our\nstress testing\nscenarios will occur.\nInstead, stress\ntesting is used to\nmodel both moderate\nand more extreme moves\nin underlying market\nfactors. When\nestimating potential\nloss, we generally\nassume that our\npositions cannot be\nreduced or hedged\n(although experience\ndemonstrates that we\nare generally able to\ndo so).\n\nLimits We use market\nrisk limits at various\nlevels to manage the\nsize of our market\nexposures. These\nlimits are set based\non VaR, EaR and on a\nrange of stress tests\nrelevant to our\nexposures. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about the\nlimit approval\nprocess. Limits are\nmonitored by Treasury\nand Risk. Risk is\nresponsible for\nidentifying and\nescalating to senior\nmanagement and/or the\nappropriate risk\ncommittee, on a timely\nbasis, instances where\nlimits have been\nexceeded (e.g., due to\npositional changes or\nchanges in market\nconditions, such as\nincreased volatilities\nor changes in\ncorrelations). Such\ninstances are\nremediated by a\nreduction in the\npositions we hold\nand/or a temporary or\npermanent increase to\nthe limit, if\nwarranted. Metrics We\nanalyze VaR at the\nfirmwide level and a\nvariety of more\ndetailed levels,\nincluding by risk\ncategory, business and\nregion.\nDiversification effect\nin the tables below\nrepresents the\ndifference between\ntotal VaR and the sum\nof the VaRs for the\nfour risk categories.\nThis effect arises\nbecause the four\nmarket risk categories\nare not perfectly\ncorrelated. During the\nfirst quarter of 2023,\nwe added the currency\nexposure on certain\ndebt and equity\npositions to VaR and\nremoved certain debt\nand equity positions\n(and related hedges)\nfrom VaR as our\nmanagement believes\nthat the risk of these\npositions is more\nappropriately measured\nand monitored using\n10% sensitivity\nmeasures.

Credit Risk Management Overview Credit\nrisk represents the potential for loss due to\nthe default or deterioration in credit quality\nof a counterparty (e.g., an OTC derivatives\ncounterparty or a borrower) or an issuer of\nsecurities or other instruments we hold. Our\nexposure to credit risk comes mostly from\nclient transactions in OTC derivatives and\nloans and lending commitments. Credit risk\nalso comes from cash placed with banks,\nsecurities financing transactions (i.e.,\nresale and repurchase agreements and\nsecurities borrowing and lending activities)\nand customer and other receivables.\n\nCredit Risk, which is independent of our\nrevenue-producing units and reports to our\nchief risk officer, has primary responsibility\nfor assessing, monitoring and managing our\ncredit risk through firmwide oversight across\nour global businesses. In addition, we hold\nother positions that give rise to credit risk\n(e.g., bonds and secondary bank loans). These\ncredit risks are captured as a component of\nmarket risk measures, which are monitored and\nmanaged by Market Risk. We also enter into\nderivatives to manage market risk exposures.\nSuch derivatives also give rise to credit\nrisk, which is monitored and managed by Credit\nRisk. Credit Risk Management Process Our\nprocess for managing credit risk includes the\ncritical components of our risk management\nframework described in the \u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk Management,\u201d as well as the\nfollowing: \u2022 Monitoring compliance with\nestablished credit risk limits and reporting\nour credit exposures and credit\nconcentrations; \u2022 Establishing or approving\nunderwriting standards; \u2022 Assessing the\nlikelihood that a counterparty will default on\nits payment obligations; \u2022 Measuring our\ncurrent and potential credit exposure and\nlosses resulting from a counterparty default;\n\u2022 Using credit risk mitigants, including\ncollateral and hedging; and \u2022 Maximizing\nrecovery through active workout and\nrestructuring of claims. We also perform\ncredit analyses, which incorporate initial and\nongoing evaluations of the capacity and\nwillingness of a counterparty to meet its\nfinancial obligations. For substantially all\nof our credit exposures, the core of our\nprocess is an annual counterparty credit\nevaluation or more frequently if deemed\nnecessary as a result of events or changes in\ncircumstances. We determine an internal credit\nrating for the counterparty by considering the\nresults of the credit evaluations and\nassumptions with respect to the nature of and\noutlook for the counterparty\u2019s industry and\nthe economic environment. Beginning in the\nfirst quarter of 2023, we also take into\nconsideration collateral received or other\ncredit support arrangements when determining\nan internal credit rating for collateralized\nloans, as management believes that this\nmethodology better reflects the credit quality\nof the underlying loans and lending\ncommitments. Prior period amounts have been\nconformed to reflect the current methodology.\nSenior personnel, with expertise in specific\nindustries, inspect and approve credit reviews\nand internal credit ratings. Our risk\nassessment process may also include, where\napplicable, reviewing certain key metrics,\nincluding, but not limited to, delinquency\nstatus, collateral value, FICO credit scores\nand other risk factors.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    109  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These shocks\ncover a wide range of\nmoderate and more\nextreme market\nmovements, including\nshocks to multiple\nrisk factors,\nconsistent with the\noccurrence of a severe\nmarket or economic\nevent. In the case of\nsovereign default, we\nestimate the direct\nimpact of the default\non our sovereign\ncredit exposures,\nchanges to our credit\nexposures arising from\npotential market moves\nin response to the\ndefault, and the\nimpact of credit\nmarket deterioration\non corporate borrowers\nand counterparties\nthat may result from\nthe sovereign default.\nUnlike potential\nexposure, which is\ncalculated within a\nspecified confidence\nlevel, stress testing\ndoes not generally\nassume a probability\nof these events\noccurring.

The\ntype and structure of\nrisk mitigants\nemployed can\nsignificantly\ninfluence the degree\nof credit risk\ninvolved in a loan or\nlending commitment.\n\nWhen we do not have\nsufficient visibility\ninto a counterparty\u2019s\nfinancial strength or\nwhen we believe a\ncounterparty requires\nsupport from its\nparent, we may obtain\nthird-party guarantees\nof the counterparty\u2019s\nobligations.

OTC Derivatives.\nOur credit exposure on\nOTC derivatives arises\nprimarily from our\nmarket-making\nactivities. As a\nmarket maker, we enter\ninto derivative\ntransactions to\nprovide liquidity to\nclients and to\nfacilitate the\ntransfer and hedging\nof their risks. We\nalso enter into\nderivatives to manage\nmarket risk exposures.\nWe manage our credit\nexposure on OTC\nderivatives using the\ncredit risk process,\nmeasures, limits and\nrisk mitigants\ndescribed above.\n\nWe generally enter\ninto OTC derivatives\ntransactions under\nbilateral collateral\narrangements that\nrequire the daily\nexchange of\ncollateral. As credit\nrisk is an essential\ncomponent of fair\nvalue, we include a\ncredit valuation\nadjustment (CVA) in\nthe fair value of\nderivatives to reflect\ncounterparty credit\nrisk, as described in\nNote 7 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements. CVA is a\nfunction of the\npresent value of\nexpected exposure, the\nprobability of\ncounterparty default\nand the assumed\nrecovery upon default.\nThe table below\npresents our net\ncredit exposure from\nOTC derivatives and\nthe concentration by\nindustry and region.\n                                              \n                As of                         \n             December                         \n  $ in                 2023             2022  \n  millio\u2026                                     \n  OTC                                         \n  deriva\u2026     $42,950          $53,399        \n  assets                                      \n  Collat\u2026                                     \n  (not                                        \n  netted      -14,420          -15,823        \n  under                                       \n  U.S.                                        \n  GAAP)                                       \n  Net                                         \n  credit      $28,530          $37,576        \n  exposu\u2026                                     \n  Indust\u2026                                     \n  Consum\u2026                                     \n  &                 3     %          3     %  \n  Retail                                      \n  Divers\u2026          11     %          8     %  \n  Indust\u2026                                     \n  Financ\u2026          21     %         20     %  \n  Instit\u2026                                     \n  Funds            20     %         19     %  \n  Health\u2026           2     %          1     %  \n  Munici\u2026                                     \n  &                 4     %          2     %  \n  Nonpro\u2026                                     \n  Natural                                     \n  Resour\u2026          17     %         34     %  \n  &                                           \n  Utilit\u2026                                     \n  Sovere\u2026          14     %          7     %  \n  Techno\u2026                                     \n  Media &           6     %          4     %  \n  Teleco\u2026                                     \n  Other                                       \n  (inclu\u2026                                     \n  Special           2     %          2     %  \n  Purpose                                     \n  Vehicl\u2026                                     \n  Total           100     %        100     %  \n  Region                                      \n  Americ\u2026          48     %         49     %  \n  EMEA             45     %         43     %  \n  Asia              7     %          8     %  \n  Total           100     %        100     %  \n                                              \nOur credit exposure\n(before any potential\nrecoveries) to OTC\nderivative\ncounterparties that\ndefaulted during 2023\nremained low,\nrepresenting less than\n2% of our total credit\nexposure from OTC\nderivatives.

As described\nabove, beginning in\nthe first quarter of\n2023, we take into\nconsideration\ncollateral received or\nother credit support\narrangements when\ndetermining an\ninternal credit rating\nfor collateralized\nloans. Prior period\namounts have been\nconformed to reflect\nthe current\nmethodology.

We are\nexposed to credit risk\nfrom our receivables\nfrom brokers, dealers\nand clearing\norganizations and\ncustomers and\ncounterparties.\nReceivables from\nbrokers, dealers and\nclearing organizations\nprimarily consist of\ninitial margin placed\nwith clearing\norganizations and\nreceivables related to\nsales of securities\nwhich have traded, but\nnot yet settled. These\nreceivables generally\nhave minimal credit\nrisk due to the low\nprobability of\nclearing organization\ndefault and the short-\nterm nature of\nreceivables related to\nsecurities\nsettlements.\nReceivables from\ncustomers and\ncounterparties\ngenerally consist of\ncollateralized\nreceivables related to\ncustomer securities\ntransactions and\ngenerally have minimal\ncredit risk due to\nboth the value of the\ncollateral received\nand the short-term\nnature of these\nreceivables.

Our credit\nexposure to\ncounterparties or\nborrowers and our\nmarket exposure to\nissuers relating to\neach of these\ncountries was not\nmaterial as of\nDecember 2023.\n\nWe have a\ncomprehensive\nframework to monitor,\nmeasure and assess our\ncountry exposures and\nto determine our risk\nappetite.

Accordingly, we\nhave in place a\ncomprehensive capital\nmanagement policy that\nprovides a framework,\ndefines objectives and\nestablishes guidelines\nto maintain an\nappropriate level and\ncomposition of capital\nin both business-as-\nusual and stressed\nconditions.

See\n\u201cCapital Management\nand Regulatory\nCapital\u201d for further\ninformation about our\ncapital management\nprocess.\n\nWe have established a\ncomprehensive\ngovernance structure\nto manage and oversee\nour day-to-day capital\nmanagement activities\nand to ensure\ncompliance with\ncapital rules and\nrelated policies. Our\ncapital management\nactivities are\noverseen by the Board\nand its committees.\nThe Board is\nresponsible for\napproving our annual\ncapital plan and the\nRisk Committee of the\nBoard approves our\ncapital management\npolicy, which details\nthe risk committees\nand members of senior\nmanagement who are\nresponsible for the\nongoing monitoring of\nour capital adequacy\nand evaluation of\ncurrent and future\nregulatory capital\nrequirements, the\nreview of the results\nof our capital\nplanning and stress\ntests processes, and\nthe results of our\ncapital models.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nConsolidation The firm consolidates entities\nin which the firm has a controlling financial\ninterest. The firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by\nfirst evaluating whether the entity is a\nvoting interest entity or a variable interest\nentity (VIE). Voting Interest Entities. Voting\ninterest entities are entities in which (i)\nthe total equity investment at risk is\nsufficient to enable the entity to finance its\nactivities independently and (ii) the equity\nholders have the power to direct the\nactivities of the entity that most\nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nthe obligation to absorb the losses of the\nentity and the right to receive the residual\nreturns of the entity. The usual condition for\na controlling financial interest in a voting\ninterest entity is ownership of a majority\nvoting interest. If the firm has a controlling\nmajority voting interest in a voting interest\nentity, the entity is consolidated. Variable\nInterest Entities. A VIE is an entity that\nlacks one or more of the characteristics of a\nvoting interest entity. The firm has a\ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE when\nthe firm has a variable interest or interests\nthat provide it with (i) the power to direct\nthe activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance and (ii) the obligation to absorb\nlosses of the VIE or the right to receive\nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially\nbe significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for\nfurther information about VIEs. Equity-Method\nInvestments. When the firm does not have a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity\nbut can exert significant influence over the\nentity\u2019s operating and financial policies, the\ninvestment is generally accounted for at fair\nvalue by electing the fair value option\navailable under U.S. GAAP. Significant\ninfluence generally exists when the firm owns\n20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock or in-\nsubstance common stock. In certain cases, the\nfirm applies the equity method of accounting\nto new investments that are strategic in\nnature or closely related to the firm\u2019s\nprincipal business activities, when the firm\nhas a significant degree of involvement in the\ncash flows or operations of the investee or\nwhen cost-benefit considerations are less\nsignificant. See Note 8 for further\ninformation about equity-method investments.\nInvestment Funds. The firm has formed\ninvestment funds with third-party investors.\nThese funds are typically organized as limited\npartnerships or limited liability companies\nfor which the firm acts as general partner or\nmanager. Generally, the firm does not hold a\nmajority of the economic interests in these\nfunds. These funds are usually voting interest\nentities and generally are not consolidated\nbecause third-party investors typically have\nrights to terminate the funds or to remove the\nfirm as general partner or manager.\nInvestments in these funds are generally\nmeasured at net asset value (NAV) and are\nincluded in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and\n22 for further information about investments\nin funds. Use of Estimates Preparation of\nthese consolidated financial statements\nrequires management to make certain estimates\nand assumptions, the most important of which\nrelate to fair value measurements, the\nallowance for credit losses on loans and\nlending commitments accounted for at amortized\ncost, accounting for goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets, provisions for losses that\nmay arise from litigation and regulatory\nproceedings (including governmental\ninvestigations), and accounting for income\ntaxes. These estimates and assumptions are\nbased on the best available information, but\nactual results could be materially different.\nRevenue Recognition Financial Assets and\nLiabilities at Fair Value. Trading assets and\nliabilities and certain investments are\ncarried at fair value either under the fair\nvalue option or in accordance with other U.S.\nGAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to\naccount for certain of its loans and other\nfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value\nby electing the fair value option. The fair\nvalue of a financial instrument is the amount\nthat would be received to sell an asset or\npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Financial assets are marked\nto bid prices and financial liabilities are\nmarked to offer prices. Fair value\nmeasurements do not include transaction costs.\nFair value gains or losses are generally\nincluded in market making or other principal\ntransactions. See Note 4 for further\ninformation about fair value measurements.\n                                       \n  134    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nRevenue from Contracts with Clients. The firm\nrecognizes revenue earned from contracts with\nclients for services, such as investment\nbanking, investment management, and execution\nand clearing (contracts with clients), when\nthe performance obligations related to the\nunderlying transaction are completed. Revenues\nfrom contracts with clients represent\napproximately 45% of total non-interest\nrevenues for 2023 (including approximately 85%\nof investment banking revenues, approximately\n95% of investment management revenues and all\ncommissions and fees), approximately 50% of\ntotal non-interest revenues for 2022\n(including approximately 85% of investment\nbanking revenues, approximately 95% of\ninvestment management revenues and all\ncommissions and fees), and approximately 45%\nof total non-interest revenues for 2021\n(including approximately 90% of both\ninvestment banking revenues and investment\nmanagement revenues, and all commissions and\nfees). See Note 25 for information about net\nrevenues by business segment. Investment\nBanking Advisory. Fees from financial advisory\nassignments are recognized in revenues when\nthe services related to the underlying\ntransaction are completed under the terms of\nthe assignment. Non-refundable deposits and\nmilestone payments in connection with\nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized\nin revenues upon completion of the underlying\ntransaction or when the assignment is\notherwise concluded. Expenses associated with\nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized\nwhen incurred and are included in transaction\nbased expenses. Client reimbursements for such\nexpenses are included in investment banking\nrevenues. Underwriting. Fees from underwriting\nassignments are recognized in revenues upon\ncompletion of the underlying transaction based\non the terms of the assignment. Expenses\nassociated with underwriting assignments are\ngenerally deferred until the related revenue\nis recognized or the assignment is otherwise\nconcluded. Such expenses are included in\ntransaction based expenses for completed\nassignments. Investment Management The firm\nearns management fees and incentive fees for\ninvestment management services, which are\nincluded in investment management revenues.\nThe firm makes payments to brokers and\nadvisors related to the placement of the\nfirm\u2019s investment funds (distribution fees),\nwhich are included in transaction based\nexpenses. Management Fees. Management fees for\nmutual funds are calculated as a percentage of\ndaily net asset value and are received\nmonthly. Management fees for hedge funds and\nseparately managed accounts are calculated as\na percentage of month-end net asset value and\nare generally received quarterly. Management\nfees for private equity funds are calculated\nas a percentage of monthly invested capital or\ncommitted capital and are received quarterly,\nsemi-annually or annually, depending on the\nfund. Management fees are recognized over time\nin the period the services are provided.\nDistribution fees paid by the firm are\ncalculated based on either a percentage of the\nmanagement fee, the investment fund\u2019s net\nasset value or the committed capital. Such\nfees are included in transaction based\nexpenses. Incentive Fees. Incentive fees are\ncalculated as a percentage of a fund\u2019s or\nseparately managed account\u2019s return, or excess\nreturn above a specified benchmark or other\nperformance target. Incentive fees are\ngenerally based on investment performance over\na twelve-month period or over the life of a\nfund. Fees that are based on performance over\na twelve-month period are subject to\nadjustment prior to the end of the measurement\nperiod. For fees that are based on investment\nperformance over the life of the fund, future\ninvestment underperformance may require fees\npreviously distributed to the firm to be\nreturned to the fund. Incentive fees earned\nfrom a fund or separately managed account are\nrecognized when it is probable that a\nsignificant reversal of such fees will not\noccur, which is generally when such fees are\nno longer subject to fluctuations in the\nmarket value of investments held by the fund\nor separately managed account. Therefore,\nincentive fees recognized during the period\nmay relate to performance obligations\nsatisfied in previous periods.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    135  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nCommissions and Fees The firm earns\nsubstantially all commissions and fees from\nexecuting and clearing client transactions on\nstock, options and futures markets, as well as\nover-the-counter (OTC) transactions.\nCommissions and fees are recognized on the day\nthe trade is executed. The firm also provides\nthird-party research services to clients in\nconnection with certain soft-dollar\narrangements. Third-party research costs\nincurred by the firm in connection with such\narrangements are presented net within\ncommissions and fees. Remaining Performance\nObligations Remaining performance obligations\nare services that the firm has committed to\nperform in the future in connection with its\ncontracts with clients. The firm\u2019s remaining\nperformance obligations are generally related\nto its financial advisory assignments and\ncertain investment management activities.\nRevenues associated with remaining performance\nobligations relating to financial advisory\nassignments cannot be determined until the\noutcome of the transaction. For the firm\u2019s\ninvestment management activities, where fees\nare calculated based on the net asset value of\nthe fund or separately managed account, future\nrevenues associated with such remaining\nperformance obligations cannot be determined\nas such fees are subject to fluctuations in\nthe market value of investments held by the\nfund or separately managed account. The firm\nis able to determine the future revenues\nassociated with management fees calculated\nbased on committed capital. As of December\n2023, substantially all future net revenues\nassociated with such remaining performance\nobligations will be recognized through 2032.\nAnnual revenues associated with such\nperformance obligations average less than $\n300million through 2032. Transfers of\nFinancial Assets Transfers of financial assets\nare accounted for as sales when the firm has\nrelinquished control over the assets\ntransferred. For transfers of financial assets\naccounted for as sales, any gains or losses\nare recognized in net revenues. Assets or\nliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s\ncontinuing involvement with transferred\nfinancial assets are initially recognized at\nfair value. For transfers of financial assets\nthat are not accounted for as sales, the\nassets are generally included in trading\nassets and the transfer is accounted for as a\ncollateralized financing, with the related\ninterest expense recognized over the life of\nthe transaction. See Note 11 for further\ninformation about transfers of financial\nassets accounted for as collateralized\nfinancings and Note 16 for further information\nabout transfers of financial assets accounted\nfor as sales. Cash and Cash Equivalents The\nfirm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid\novernight deposits held in the ordinary course\nof business. Cash and cash equivalents\nincluded cash and due from banks of $\n7.93billion as of December 2023 and $\n7.87billion as of December 2022. Cash and cash\nequivalents also included interest-bearing\ndeposits with banks of $ 233.65billion as of\nDecember 2023 and $ 233.96billion as of\nDecember 2022. The firm segregates cash for\nregulatory and other purposes related to\nclient activity. Cash and cash equivalents\nsegregated for regulatory and other purposes\nwere $ 17.08billion as of December 2023 and $\n16.94billion as of December 2022. In addition,\nthe firm segregates securities for regulatory\nand other purposes related to client activity.\nSee Note 11 for further information about\nsegregated securities. Customer and Other\nReceivables Customer and other receivables\nincluded receivables from customers and\ncounterparties of $ 90.16billion as of\nDecember 2023 and $ 67.88billion as of\nDecember 2022, and receivables from brokers,\ndealers and clearing organizations of $\n42.33billion as of December 2023 and $\n67.57billion as of December 2022. Such\nreceivables primarily consist of customer\nmargin loans, collateral posted in connection\nwith certain derivative transactions, and\nreceivables resulting from unsettled\ntransactions. Substantially all of these\nreceivables are accounted for at amortized\ncost net of any allowance for credit losses,\nwhich generally approximates fair value. As\nthese receivables are not accounted for at\nfair value, they are not included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5.\nHad these receivables been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, substantially all\nwould have been classified in level 2 as of\nboth December 2023 and December 2022. See Note\n10 for further information about customer and\nother receivables accounted for at fair value\nunder the fair value option. Interest on\ncustomer and other receivables is recognized\nover the life of the transaction and included\nin interest income. Customer and other\nreceivables includes receivables from\ncontracts with clients and contract assets.\nContract assets represent the firm\u2019s right to\nreceive consideration for services provided in\nconnection with its contracts with clients for\nwhich collection is conditional and not merely\nsubject to the passage of time. The firm\u2019s\nreceivables from contracts with clients were $\n3.59billion as of December 2023 and $\n3.01billion as of December 2022. As of both\nDecember 2023 and December 2022, contract\nassets were not material.\n                                       \n  136    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Such\npayables primarily consist of customer credit\nbalances related to the firm\u2019s prime brokerage\nactivities. Customer and other payables are\naccounted for at cost plus accrued interest,\nwhich generally approximates fair value. As\nthese payables are not accounted for at fair\nvalue, they are not included in the firm\u2019s\nfair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had\nthese payables been included in the firm\u2019s\nfair value hierarchy, substantially all would\nhave been classified in level 2 as of both\nDecember 2023 and December 2022. Interest on\ncustomer and other payables is recognized over\nthe life of the transaction and included in\ninterest expense. Offsetting Assets and\nLiabilities To reduce credit exposures on\nderivatives and securities financing\ntransactions, the firm may enter into master\nnetting agreements or similar arrangements\n(collectively, netting agreements) with\ncounterparties that permit it to offset\nreceivables and payables with such\ncounterparties. A netting agreement is a\ncontract with a counterparty that permits net\nsettlement of multiple transactions with that\ncounterparty, including upon the exercise of\ntermination rights by a non-defaulting party.\nUpon exercise of such termination rights, all\ntransactions governed by the netting agreement\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is\ncalculated. In addition, the firm receives and\nposts cash and securities collateral with\nrespect to its derivatives and securities\nfinancing transactions, subject to the terms\nof the related credit support agreements or\nsimilar arrangements (collectively, credit\nsupport agreements). An enforceable credit\nsupport agreement grants the non-defaulting\nparty exercising termination rights the right\nto liquidate the collateral and apply the\nproceeds to any amounts owed. In order to\nassess enforceability of the firm\u2019s right of\nsetoff under netting and credit support\nagreements, the firm evaluates various\nfactors, including applicable bankruptcy laws,\nlocal statutes and regulatory provisions in\nthe jurisdiction of the parties to the\nagreement. Derivatives are reported on a net-\nby-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable\nor receivable for derivative assets and\nliabilities for a given counterparty) in the\nconsolidated balance sheets when a legal right\nof setoff exists under an enforceable netting\nagreement. Resale agreements and securities\nsold under agreements to repurchase\n(repurchase agreements) and securities\nborrowed and loaned transactions with the same\nsettlement date are presented on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis in the consolidated balance\nsheets when such transactions meet certain\nsettlement criteria and are subject to netting\nagreements. In the consolidated balance\nsheets, derivatives are reported net of cash\ncollateral received and posted under\nenforceable credit support agreements, when\ntransacted under an enforceable netting\nagreement. In the consolidated balance sheets,\nresale and repurchase agreements, and\nsecurities borrowed and loaned, are not\nreported net of the related cash and\nsecurities received or posted as collateral.\nSee Note 11 for further information about\ncollateral received and pledged, including\nrights to deliver or repledge collateral. See\nNotes 7 and 11 for further information about\noffsetting assets and liabilities. Foreign\nCurrency Translation Assets and liabilities\ndenominated in non-U.S. currencies are\ntranslated at rates of exchange prevailing on\nthe date of the consolidated balance sheets\nand revenues and expenses are translated at\naverage rates of exchange for the period.\nForeign currency remeasurement gains or losses\non transactions in nonfunctional currencies\nare recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on\ntranslation of the financial statements of a\nnon-U.S. operation, when the functional\ncurrency is other than the U.S. dollar, are\nincluded, net of hedges and taxes, in the\nconsolidated statements of comprehensive\nincome.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    137  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Fair Value Measurements The fair value\nof a financial instrument is the amount that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Financial assets are marked to bid\nprices and financial liabilities are marked to\noffer prices. Fair value measurements do not\ninclude transaction costs. The firm measures\ncertain financial assets and liabilities as a\nportfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to\nmarket and/or credit risks). The best evidence\nof fair value is a quoted price in an active\nmarket. If quoted prices in active markets are\nnot available, fair value is determined by\nreference to prices for similar instruments,\nquoted prices or recent transactions in less\nactive markets, or internally developed models\nthat primarily use market-based or\nindependently sourced inputs, including, but\nnot limited to, interest rates, volatilities,\nequity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates,\ncommodity prices, credit spreads and funding\nspreads (i.e., the spread or difference\nbetween the interest rate at which a borrower\ncould finance a given financial instrument\nrelative to a benchmark interest rate). U.S.\nGAAP has a three-level hierarchy for\ndisclosure of fair value measurements. This\nhierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation\ntechniques used to measure fair value, giving\nthe highest priority to level 1 inputs and the\nlowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial\ninstrument\u2019s level in this hierarchy is based\non the lowest level of input that is\nsignificant to its fair value measurement. In\nevaluating the significance of a valuation\ninput, the firm considers, among other\nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to\nthat input. The fair value hierarchy is as\nfollows: Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets to which the firm had\naccess at the measurement date for identical,\nunrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2.\nInputs to valuation techniques are observable,\neither directly or indirectly. Level 3. One or\nmore inputs to valuation techniques are\nsignificant and unobservable. The fair values\nfor substantially all of the firm\u2019s financial\nassets and liabilities are based on observable\nprices and inputs and are classified in levels\n1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain\nlevel 2 and level 3 financial assets and\nliabilities may require valuation adjustments\nthat a market participant would require to\narrive at fair value for factors, such as\ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality,\nfunding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity\nand bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments\nare generally based on market evidence.\nThe table below presents financial assets and\nliabilities carried at fair value.\n                                              \n  $

See Note 5 for further\ninformation about significant unobservable\ninputs used to value level 3 financial\ninstruments. Valuation Techniques and\nSignificant Inputs for Trading Cash\nInstruments, Investments and Loans Level 1.\nLevel 1 instruments include U.S. government\nobligations, most non-U.S. government\nobligations, certain agency obligations,\ncertain corporate debt instruments, certain\nmoney market instruments and actively traded\nlisted equities. These instruments are valued\nusing quoted prices for identical unrestricted\ninstruments in active markets. The firm\ndefines active markets for equity instruments\nbased on the average daily trading volume both\nin absolute terms and relative to the market\ncapitalization for the instrument. The firm\ndefines active markets for debt instruments\nbased on both the average daily trading volume\nand the number of days with trading activity.\nLevel 2. Level 2 instruments include certain\nnon-U.S. government obligations, most agency\nobligations, most mortgage-backed loans and\nsecurities, most corporate debt instruments,\nmost state and municipal obligations, most\nmoney market instruments, most other debt\nobligations, restricted or less liquid listed\nequities, certain private equities,\ncommodities and certain lending commitments.\nValuations of level 2 instruments can be\nverified to quoted prices, recent trading\nactivity for identical or similar instruments,\nbroker or dealer quotations or alternative\npricing sources with reasonable levels of\nprice transparency. Consideration is given to\nthe nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative\nor executable) and the relationship of recent\nmarket activity to the prices provided from\nalternative pricing sources. Valuation\nadjustments are typically made to level 2\ninstruments (i) if the instrument is subject\nto transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other\npremiums and liquidity discounts that a market\nparticipant would require to arrive at fair\nvalue. Valuation adjustments are generally\nbased on market evidence. Level 3. Level 3\ninstruments have one or more significant\nvaluation inputs that are not observable.\nAbsent evidence to the contrary, level 3\ninstruments are initially valued at\ntransaction price, which is considered to be\nthe best initial estimate of fair value.\nSubsequently, the firm uses other\nmethodologies to determine fair value, which\nvary based on the type of instrument.\nValuation inputs and assumptions are changed\nwhen corroborated by substantive observable\nevidence, including values realized on sales.\nValuation techniques of level 3 instruments\nvary by instrument, but are generally based on\ndiscounted cash flow techniques. The valuation\ntechniques and the nature of significant\ninputs used to determine the fair values of\neach type of level 3 instrument are described\nbelow: Loans and Securities Backed by\nCommercial Real Estate Loans and securities\nbacked by commercial real estate are directly\nor indirectly collateralized by a single\nproperty or a portfolio of properties, and may\ninclude tranches of varying levels of\nsubordination. Significant inputs are\ngenerally determined based on relative value\nanalyses and include: \u2022 Market yields implied\nby transactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and changes in market\nindices, such as the CMBX (an index that\ntracks the performance of commercial mortgage\nbonds); \u2022 Transaction prices in both the\nunderlying collateral and instruments with the\nsame or similar underlying collateral; \u2022 A\nmeasure of expected future cash flows in a\ndefault scenario (recovery rates) implied by\nthe value of the underlying collateral, which\nis mainly driven by current performance of the\nunderlying collateral and capitalization\nrates. Recovery rates are expressed as a\npercentage of notional or face value of the\ninstrument and reflect the benefit of credit\nenhancements on certain instruments; and \u2022\nTiming of expected future cash flows\n(duration) which, in certain cases, may\nincorporate the impact of any loan\nforbearances and other unobservable inputs\n(e.g., prepayment speeds). Loans and\nSecurities Backed by Residential Real Estate\nLoans and securities backed by residential\nreal estate are directly or indirectly\ncollateralized by portfolios of residential\nreal estate and may include tranches of\nvarying levels of subordination. Significant\ninputs are generally determined based on\nrelative value analyses, which incorporate\ncomparisons to instruments with similar\ncollateral and risk profiles. Significant\ninputs include: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets; \u2022\nTransaction prices in both the underlying\ncollateral and instruments with the same or\nsimilar underlying collateral; \u2022 Cumulative\nloss expectations, driven by default rates,\nhome price projections, residential property\nliquidation timelines, related costs and\nsubsequent recoveries; and \u2022 Duration, driven\nby underlying loan prepayment speeds and\nresidential property liquidation timelines.\n                                       \n  140    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nCorporate Debt Instruments Corporate debt\ninstruments includes corporate loans, debt\nsecurities and convertible debentures.\nSignificant inputs for corporate debt\ninstruments are generally determined based on\nrelative value analyses, which incorporate\ncomparisons both to prices of credit default\nswaps that reference the same or similar\nunderlying instrument or entity and to other\ndebt instruments for the same or similar\nissuer for which observable prices or broker\nquotations are available. Significant inputs\ninclude: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and trends of market\nindices, such as the CDX (an index that tracks\nthe performance of corporate credit); \u2022\nCurrent performance and recovery assumptions\nand, where the firm uses credit default swaps\nto value the related instrument, the cost of\nborrowing the underlying reference obligation;\n\u2022 Duration; and \u2022 Market and transaction\nmultiples for corporate debt instruments with\nconvertibility or participation options.\nEquity Securities Equity securities consists\nof private equities. Recent third-party\ncompleted or pending transactions (e.g.,\nmerger proposals, debt restructurings, tender\noffers) are considered the best evidence for\nany change in fair value. When these are not\navailable, the following valuation\nmethodologies are used, as appropriate: \u2022\nIndustry multiples (primarily EBITDA and\nrevenue multiples) and public comparables; \u2022\nTransactions in similar instruments; \u2022\nDiscounted cash flow techniques; and \u2022 Third-\nparty appraisals. The firm also considers\nchanges in the outlook for the relevant\nindustry and financial performance of the\nissuer as compared to projected performance.\nSignificant inputs include: \u2022 Market and\ntransaction multiples; \u2022 Discount rates and\ncapitalization rates; and \u2022 For equity\nsecurities with debt-like features, market\nyields implied by transactions of similar or\nrelated assets, current performance and\nrecovery assumptions, and duration. Other\nTrading Cash Instruments, Investments and\nLoans The significant inputs to the valuation\nof other instruments, such as non-U.S.\ngovernment and agency obligations, state and\nmunicipal obligations, and other loans and\ndebt obligations are generally determined\nbased on relative value analyses, which\nincorporate comparisons both to prices of\ncredit default swaps that reference the same\nor similar underlying instrument or entity and\nto other debt instruments for the same issuer\nfor which observable prices or broker\nquotations are available. Significant inputs\ninclude: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and trends of market\nindices; \u2022 Current performance and recovery\nassumptions and, where the firm uses credit\ndefault swaps to value the related instrument,\nthe cost of borrowing the underlying reference\nobligation; and \u2022 Duration. Valuation\nTechniques and Significant Inputs for\nDerivatives The firm\u2019s level 2 and level 3\nderivatives are valued using derivative\npricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow\nmodels, correlation models and models that\nincorporate option pricing methodologies, such\nas Monte Carlo simulations). Price\ntransparency of derivatives can generally be\ncharacterized by product type, as described\nbelow. \u2022 Interest Rate. In general, the key\ninputs used to value interest rate derivatives\nare transparent, even for most long-dated\ncontracts. Interest rate swaps and options\ndenominated in the currencies of leading\nindustrialized nations are characterized by\nhigh trading volumes and tight bid/offer\nspreads. Interest rate derivatives that\nreference indices, such as an inflation index,\nor the shape of the yield curve (e.g., 10-year\nswap rate vs. 2-year swap rate) are more\ncomplex, but the key inputs are generally\nobservable. \u2022 Credit. Price transparency for\ncredit default swaps, including both single\nnames and baskets of credits, varies by market\nand underlying reference entity or obligation.\nCredit default swaps that reference indices,\nlarge corporates and major sovereigns\ngenerally exhibit the most price transparency.\nFor credit default swaps with other\nunderliers, price transparency varies based on\ncredit rating, the cost of borrowing the\nunderlying reference obligations, and the\navailability of the underlying reference\nobligations for delivery upon the default of\nthe issuer. Credit default swaps that\nreference loans, asset-backed securities and\nemerging market debt instruments tend to have\nless price transparency than those that\nreference corporate bonds. In addition, more\ncomplex credit derivatives, such as those\nsensitive to the correlation between two or\nmore underlying reference obligations,\ngenerally have less price transparency.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    141  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n\u2022 Currency. Prices for currency derivatives\nbased on the exchange rates of leading\nindustrialized nations, including those with\nlonger tenors, are generally transparent. The\nprimary difference between the price\ntransparency of developed and emerging market\ncurrency derivatives is that emerging markets\ntend to be only observable for contracts with\nshorter tenors. \u2022 Commodity. Commodity\nderivatives include transactions referenced to\nenergy (e.g., oil, natural gas and\nelectricity), metals (e.g., precious and base)\nand soft commodities (e.g., agricultural).\nPrice transparency varies based on the\nunderlying commodity, delivery location, tenor\nand product quality (e.g., diesel fuel\ncompared to unleaded gasoline). In general,\nprice transparency for commodity derivatives\nis greater for contracts with shorter tenors\nand contracts that are more closely aligned\nwith major and/or benchmark commodity indices.\n\u2022 Equity. Price transparency for equity\nderivatives varies by market and underlier.\nOptions on indices and the common stock of\ncorporates included in major equity indices\nexhibit the most price transparency. Equity\nderivatives generally have observable market\nprices, except for contracts with long tenors\nor reference prices that differ significantly\nfrom current market prices. More complex\nequity derivatives, such as those sensitive to\nthe correlation between two or more individual\nstocks, generally have less price\ntransparency. Liquidity is essential to the\nobservability of all product types. If\ntransaction volumes decline, previously\ntransparent prices and other inputs may become\nunobservable. Conversely, even highly\nstructured products may at times have trading\nvolumes large enough to provide observability\nof prices and other inputs. Level 1. Level 1\nderivatives include short-term contracts for\nfuture delivery of securities when the\nunderlying security is a level 1 instrument,\nand exchange-traded derivatives if they are\nactively traded and are valued at their quoted\nmarket price. Level 2. Level 2 derivatives\ninclude OTC derivatives for which all\nsignificant valuation inputs are corroborated\nby market evidence and exchange-traded\nderivatives that are not actively traded\nand/or that are valued using models that\ncalibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC\nderivatives. The selection of a particular\nmodel to value a derivative depends on the\ncontractual terms of and specific risks\ninherent in the instrument, as well as the\navailability of pricing information in the\nmarket. For derivatives that trade in liquid\nmarkets, model selection does not involve\nsignificant management judgment because\noutputs of models can be calibrated to market-\nclearing levels. Valuation models require a\nvariety of inputs, such as contractual terms,\nmarket prices, yield curves, discount rates\n(including those derived from interest rates\non collateral received and posted as specified\nin credit support agreements for\ncollateralized derivatives), credit curves,\nmeasures of volatility, prepayment rates, loss\nseverity rates and correlations of such\ninputs. Significant inputs to the valuations\nof level 2 derivatives can be verified to\nmarket transactions, broker or dealer\nquotations or other alternative pricing\nsources with reasonable levels of price\ntransparency. Consideration is given to the\nnature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or\nexecutable) and the relationship of recent\nmarket activity to the prices provided from\nalternative pricing sources. Level 3 . Level 3\nderivatives are valued using models which\nutilize observable level 1 and/or level 2\ninputs, as well as unobservable level 3\ninputs. The significant unobservable inputs\nused to value the firm\u2019s level 3 derivatives\nare described below. \u2022 For level 3 interest\nrate and currency derivatives, significant\nunobservable inputs include correlations of\ncertain currencies and interest rates (e.g.,\nthe correlation between Euro inflation and\nEuro interest rates) and specific interest\nrate and currency volatilities. \u2022 For level 3\ncredit derivatives, significant unobservable\ninputs include illiquid credit spreads and\nupfront credit points, which are unique to\nspecific reference obligations and reference\nentities, and recovery rates. \u2022 For level 3\ncommodity derivatives, significant\nunobservable inputs include volatilities for\noptions with strike prices that differ\nsignificantly from current market prices and\nprices or spreads for certain products for\nwhich the product quality or physical location\nof the commodity is not aligned with benchmark\nindices. \u2022 For level 3 equity derivatives,\nsignificant unobservable inputs generally\ninclude equity volatility inputs for options\nthat are long-dated and/or have strike prices\nthat differ significantly from current market\nprices. In addition, the valuation of certain\nstructured trades requires the use of level 3\ncorrelation inputs, such as the correlation of\nthe price performance of two or more\nindividual stocks or the correlation of the\nprice performance for a basket of stocks to\nanother asset class, such as commodities.\n                                       \n  142    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nSubsequent to the initial valuation of a level\n3 derivative, the firm updates the level 1 and\nlevel 2 inputs to reflect observable market\nchanges and any resulting gains and losses are\nclassified in level 3. Level 3 inputs are\nchanged when corroborated by evidence, such as\nsimilar market transactions, third-party\npricing services and/or broker or dealer\nquotations or other empirical market data. In\ncircumstances where the firm cannot verify the\nmodel value by reference to market\ntransactions, it is possible that a different\nvaluation model could produce a materially\ndifferent estimate of fair value. See Note 5\nfor further information about significant\nunobservable inputs used in the valuation of\nlevel 3 derivatives. Valuation Adjustments.\nValuation adjustments are integral to\ndetermining the fair value of derivative\nportfolios and are used to adjust the mid-\nmarket valuations produced by derivative\npricing models to the exit price valuation.\nThese adjustments incorporate bid/offer\nspreads, the cost of liquidity, and credit and\nfunding valuation adjustments, which account\nfor the credit and funding risk inherent in\nthe uncollateralized portion of derivative\nportfolios. The firm also makes funding\nvaluation adjustments to collateralized\nderivatives where the terms of the agreement\ndo not permit the firm to deliver or repledge\ncollateral received. Market-based inputs are\ngenerally used when calibrating valuation\nadjustments to market-clearing levels. In\naddition, for derivatives that include\nsignificant unobservable inputs, the firm\nmakes model or exit price adjustments to\naccount for the valuation uncertainty present\nin the transaction. Valuation Techniques and\nSignificant Inputs for Other Financial Assets\nand Liabilities at Fair Value In addition to\ntrading cash instruments, derivatives, and\ncertain investments and loans, the firm\naccounts for certain of its other financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value under the\nfair value option. Such instruments include\nrepurchase agreements and substantially all\nresale agreements; certain securities borrowed\nand loaned transactions; certain customer and\nother receivables, including certain margin\nloans; certain time deposits, including\nstructured certificates of deposit, which are\nhybrid financial instruments; substantially\nall other secured financings, including\ntransfers of assets accounted for as\nfinancings; certain unsecured short- and long-\nterm borrowings, substantially all of which\nare hybrid financial instruments; and certain\nother assets and liabilities. These\ninstruments are generally valued based on\ndiscounted cash flow techniques, which\nincorporate inputs with reasonable levels of\nprice transparency, and are generally\nclassified in level 2 because the inputs are\nobservable. Valuation adjustments may be made\nfor liquidity and for counterparty and the\nfirm\u2019s credit quality. The significant inputs\nused to value the firm\u2019s other financial\nassets and liabilities are described below.\nResale and Repurchase Agreements and\nSecurities Borrowed and Loaned. The\nsignificant inputs to the valuation of resale\nand repurchase agreements and securities\nborrowed and loaned are funding spreads, the\namount and timing of expected future cash\nflows and interest rates. Customer and Other\nReceivables. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of receivables are interest rates,\nthe amount and timing of expected future cash\nflows and funding spreads. Deposits. The\nsignificant inputs to the valuation of time\ndeposits are interest rates and the amount and\ntiming of future cash flows. The inputs used\nto value the embedded derivative component of\nhybrid financial instruments are consistent\nwith the inputs used to value the firm\u2019s other\nderivative instruments described above. See\nNote 7 for further information about\nderivatives and Note 13 for further\ninformation about deposits. Other Secured\nFinancings. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of other secured financings are the\namount and timing of expected future cash\nflows, interest rates, funding spreads and the\nfair value of the collateral delivered by the\nfirm (determined using the amount and timing\nof expected future cash flows, market prices,\nmarket yields and recovery assumptions). See\nNote 11 for further information about other\nsecured financings. Unsecured Short- and Long-\nTerm Borrowings. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of unsecured short- and long-term\nborrowings are the amount and timing of\nexpected future cash flows, interest rates,\nthe credit spreads of the firm and commodity\nprices for prepaid commodity transactions. The\ninputs used to value the embedded derivative\ncomponent of hybrid financial instruments are\nconsistent with the inputs used to value the\nfirm\u2019s other derivative instruments described\nabove. See Note 7 for further information\nabout derivatives and Note 14 for further\ninformation about borrowings. Other Assets and\nLiabilities. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of other assets and liabilities are\nthe amount and timing of expected future cash\nflows, interest rates, market yields,\nvolatility and correlation inputs.

Transfers into level 3 trading cash\ninstrument assets during 2022 primarily\nreflected transfers of certain equity\nsecurities (included in other cash\ninstruments) and corporate debt instruments\nfrom both level 1 and level 2 (in each case,\nprincipally due to reduced price transparency\nas a result of a lack of market evidence,\nincluding fewer market transactions in these\ninstruments). Transfers out of level 3 trading\ncash instrument assets during 2022 primarily\nreflected transfers of certain corporate debt\ninstruments to level 2 (principally due to\nincreased price transparency as a result of\nmarket evidence, including market transactions\nin these instruments).\n                                       \n  146    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n\u2022 Averages represent the arithmetic average of\nthe inputs and are not weighted by the\nrelative fair value or notional amount of the\nrespective financial instruments. An average\ngreater than the median indicates that the\nmajority of inputs are below the average. For\nexample, the difference between the average\nand the median for credit spreads indicates\nthat the majority of the inputs fall in the\nlower end of the range. \u2022 The ranges, averages\nand medians of these inputs are not\nrepresentative of the appropriate inputs to\nuse when calculating the fair value of any one\nderivative. For example, the highest\ncorrelation for interest rate derivatives is\nappropriate for valuing a specific interest\nrate derivative but may not be appropriate for\nvaluing any other interest rate derivative.\nAccordingly, the ranges of inputs do not\nrepresent uncertainty in, or possible ranges\nof, fair value measurements of level 3\nderivatives. \u2022 Interest rates, currencies and\nequities derivatives are valued using option\npricing models, credit derivatives are valued\nusing option pricing, correlation and\ndiscounted cash flow models, and commodities\nderivatives are valued using option pricing\nand discounted cash flow models. \u2022 The fair\nvalue of any one instrument may be determined\nusing multiple valuation techniques. For\nexample, option pricing models and discounted\ncash flow models are typically used together\nto determine fair value. Therefore, the level\n3 balance encompasses both of these\ntechniques. \u2022 Correlation within currencies\nand equities includes cross-product type\ncorrelation. \u2022 Natural gas spread represents\nthe spread per million British thermal units\nof natural gas. \u2022 Oil spread represents the\nspread per barrel of oil and refined products.\n\u2022 Electricity price represents the price per\nmegawatt hour of electricity. Range of\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs. The following\nprovides information about the ranges of\nsignificant unobservable inputs used to value\nthe firm\u2019s level 3 derivative instruments: \u2022\nCorrelation. Ranges for correlation cover a\nvariety of underliers both within one product\ntype (e.g., equity index and equity single\nstock names) and across product types (e.g.,\ncorrelation of an interest rate and a\ncurrency), as well as across regions.\nGenerally, cross-product type correlation\ninputs are used to value more complex\ninstruments and are lower than correlation\ninputs on assets within the same derivative\nproduct type. \u2022 Volatility. Ranges for\nvolatility cover numerous underliers across a\nvariety of markets, maturities and strike\nprices. For example, volatility of equity\nindices is generally lower than volatility of\nsingle stocks. \u2022 Credit spreads, upfront\ncredit points and recovery rates. The ranges\nfor credit spreads, upfront credit points and\nrecovery rates cover a variety of underliers\n(index and single names), regions, sectors,\nmaturities and credit qualities (high-yield\nand investment-grade). The broad range of this\npopulation gives rise to the width of the\nranges of significant unobservable inputs. \u2022\nCommodity prices and spreads. The ranges for\ncommodity prices and spreads cover variability\nin products, maturities and delivery\nlocations. Sensitivity of Fair Value\nMeasurement to Changes in Significant\nUnobservable Inputs. The following is a\ndescription of the directional sensitivity of\nthe firm\u2019s level 3 fair value measurements to\nchanges in significant unobservable inputs, in\nisolation, as of each period-end: \u2022\nCorrelation. In general, for contracts where\nthe holder benefits from the convergence of\nthe underlying asset or index prices (e.g.,\ninterest rates, credit spreads, foreign\nexchange rates, inflation rates and equity\nprices), an increase in correlation results in\na higher fair value measurement. \u2022 Volatility.\nIn general, for purchased options, an increase\nin volatility results in a higher fair value\nmeasurement. \u2022 Credit spreads, upfront credit\npoints and recovery rates. In general, the\nfair value of purchased credit protection\nincreases as credit spreads or upfront credit\npoints increase or recovery rates decrease.\nCredit spreads, upfront credit points and\nrecovery rates are strongly related to\ndistinctive risk factors of the underlying\nreference obligations, which include reference\nentity-specific factors, such as leverage,\nvolatility and industry, market-based risk\nfactors, such as borrowing costs or liquidity\nof the underlying reference obligation, and\nmacroeconomic conditions. \u2022 Commodity prices\nand spreads.

For example, the\nhighest yield for real estate loans is\nappropriate for valuing a specific real estate\nloan but may not be appropriate for valuing\nany other real estate loan. Accordingly, the\nranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty\nin, or possible ranges of, fair value\nmeasurements of level 3 loans. \u2022 Increases in\nyield or duration used in the valuation of\nlevel 3 loans would have resulted in a lower\nfair value measurement, while increases in\nrecovery rate would have resulted in a higher\nfair value measurement as of both December\n2023 and December 2022. Due to the distinctive\nnature of each level 3 loan, the\ninterrelationship of inputs is not necessarily\nuniform within each product type. \u2022 Loans are\nvalued using discounted cash flows. \u2022 The\nsignificant unobservable inputs for duration\nrelated to other collateralized loans as of\nDecember 2023 did not have a range (and there\nwas no weighted average) as it related to a\nsingle position. Therefore, such unobservable\ninputs are not included in the table above. \u2022\nThe significant unobservable inputs for\nduration related to other loans as of December\n2022 did not have a range (and there was no\nweighted average) as it related to a purchased\nportfolio of revolving loans with a single\nduration.

For example, most of the\nfirm\u2019s longer-term derivatives across product\ntypes are sensitive to changes in interest\nrates and may be economically hedged with\ninterest rate swaps. Similarly, a significant\nportion of the firm\u2019s trading cash instruments\nand derivatives across product types has\nexposure to foreign currencies and may be\neconomically hedged with foreign currency\ncontracts.\n                                       \n  158    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Certain of the\nfirm\u2019s OTC derivatives are cleared and settled\nthrough central clearing counterparties (OTC-\ncleared), while others are bilateral contracts\nbetween two counterparties (bilateral OTC).\nMarket Making. As a market maker, the firm\nenters into derivative transactions to provide\nliquidity to clients and to facilitate the\ntransfer and hedging of their risks. In this\nrole, the firm typically acts as principal and\nis required to commit capital to provide\nexecution, and maintains market-making\npositions in response to, or in anticipation\nof, client demand. Risk Management. The firm\nalso enters into derivatives to actively\nmanage risk exposures that arise from its\nmarket-making and investing and financing\nactivities. The firm\u2019s holdings and exposures\nare hedged, in many cases, on either a\nportfolio or risk-specific basis, as opposed\nto an instrument-by-instrument basis. The\noffsetting impact of this economic hedging is\nreflected in the same business segment as the\nrelated revenues. In addition, the firm may\nenter into derivatives designated as hedges\nunder U.S. GAAP. These derivatives are used to\nmanage interest rate exposure of certain\nfixed-rate unsecured borrowings and deposits\nand certain U.S. and non-U.S. government\nsecurities classified as available-for-sale,\nforeign exchange risk of certain available-\nfor-sale securities and the net investment in\ncertain non-U.S. operations.\n\nThe firm enters into various types of\nderivatives, including: \u2022 Futures and\nForwards. Contracts that commit counterparties\nto purchase or sell financial instruments,\ncommodities or currencies in the future. \u2022\nSwaps. Contracts that require counterparties\nto exchange cash flows, such as currency or\ninterest payment streams. The amounts\nexchanged are based on the specific terms of\nthe contract with reference to specified\nrates, financial instruments, commodities,\ncurrencies or indices. \u2022 Options. Contracts in\nwhich the option purchaser has the right, but\nnot the obligation, to purchase from or sell\nto the option writer financial instruments,\ncommodities or currencies within a defined\ntime period for a specified price. Derivatives\nare reported on a net-by-counterparty basis\n(i.e., the net payable or receivable for\nderivative assets and liabilities for a given\ncounterparty) when a legal right of setoff\nexists under an enforceable netting agreement\n(counterparty netting). Derivatives are\naccounted for at fair value, net of cash\ncollateral received or posted under\nenforceable credit support agreements (cash\ncollateral netting). Derivative assets are\nincluded in trading assetsand derivative\nliabilities are included in trading\nliabilities. Realized and unrealized gains and\nlosseson derivatives not designated as hedges\nare included in market making (for derivatives\nincluded in Fixed Income, Currency and\nCommodities (FICC) and Equities within Global\nBanking & Markets), and other principal\ntransactions (for derivatives included in\nInvestment banking fees and Other within\nGlobal Banking & Markets, as well as\nderivatives in Asset & Wealth Management) in\nthe consolidated statements of earnings.

Credit\nDerivatives The firm enters into a broad array\nof credit derivatives to facilitate client\ntransactions and to manage the credit risk\nassociated with market-making and investing\nand financing activities. Credit derivatives\nare actively managed based on the firm\u2019s net\nrisk position. Credit derivatives are\ngenerally individually negotiated contracts\nand can have various settlement and payment\nconventions. Credit events include failure to\npay, bankruptcy, acceleration of indebtedness,\nrestructuring, repudiation and dissolution of\nthe reference entity. The firm enters into the\nfollowing types of credit derivatives: \u2022\nCredit Default Swaps. Single-name credit\ndefault swaps protect the buyer against the\nloss of principal on one or more bonds, loans\nor mortgages (reference obligations) in the\nevent the issuer of the reference obligations\nsuffers a credit event. The buyer of\nprotection pays an initial or periodic premium\nto the seller and receives protection for the\nperiod of the contract. If there is no credit\nevent, as defined in the contract, the seller\nof protection makes no payments to the buyer.\nIf a credit event occurs, the seller of\nprotection is required to make a payment to\nthe buyer, calculated according to the terms\nof the contract. \u2022 Credit Options. In a credit\noption, the option writer assumes the\nobligation to purchase or sell a reference\nobligation at a specified price or credit\nspread. The option purchaser buys the right,\nbut does not assume the obligation, to sell\nthe reference obligation to, or purchase it\nfrom, the option writer. The payments on\ncredit options depend either on a particular\ncredit spread or the price of the reference\nobligation.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    161  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n\u2022 Credit Indices, Baskets and Tranches. Credit\nderivatives may reference a basket of single-\nname credit default swaps or a broad-based\nindex. If a credit event occurs in one of the\nunderlying reference obligations, the\nprotection seller pays the protection buyer.\nThe payment is typically a pro-rata portion of\nthe transaction\u2019s total notional amount based\non the underlying defaulted reference\nobligation. In certain transactions, the\ncredit risk of a basket or index is separated\ninto various portions (tranches), each having\ndifferent levels of subordination. The most\njunior tranches cover initial defaults and\nonce losses exceed the notional amount of\nthese junior tranches, any excess loss is\ncovered by the next most senior tranche. \u2022\nTotal Return Swaps. A total return swap\ntransfers the risks relating to economic\nperformance of a reference obligation from the\nprotection buyer to the protection seller.\nTypically, the protection buyer receives a\nfloating rate of interest and protection\nagainst any reduction in fair value of the\nreference obligation, and the protection\nseller receives the cash flows associated with\nthe reference obligation, plus any increase in\nthe fair value of the reference obligation.\nThe firm economically hedges its exposure to\nwritten credit derivatives primarily by\nentering into offsetting purchased credit\nderivatives with identical underliers.\nSubstantially all of the firm\u2019s purchased\ncredit derivative transactions are with\nfinancial institutions and are subject to\nstringent collateral thresholds. In addition,\nupon the occurrence of a specified trigger\nevent, the firm may take possession of the\nreference obligations underlying a particular\nwritten credit derivative, and consequently\nmay, upon liquidation of the reference\nobligations, recover amounts on the underlying\nreference obligations in the event of default.\nThe table below\npresents information\nabout credit\nderivatives.\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026  0        \u2026              \u2026         \n         \u2026  -        -              \u2026         \n         \u2026  \u2026        \u2026              \u2026         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n         \u2026        \u2026       \u2026              \u2026    \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\u2022 Fair values exclude\nthe effects of both\nnetting of receivable\nbalances with payable\nbalances under\nenforceable netting\nagreements, and\nnetting of cash\nreceived or posted\nunder enforceable\ncredit support\nagreements, and\ntherefore are not\nrepresentative of the\nfirm\u2019s credit\nexposure.\n\u2022 Tenor is based on\nremaining contractual\nmaturity.\n\u2022 The credit spread on\nthe underlier,\ntogether with the\ntenor of the contract,\nare indicators of\npayment/performance\nrisk.

Corporate\nloans are secured (typically by a senior lien\non the assets of the borrower) or unsecured,\ndepending on the loan purpose, the risk\nprofile of the borrower and other factors. \u2022\nCommercial Real Estate. Commercial real estate\nloans includes originated loans that are\ndirectly or indirectly secured by hotels,\nretail stores, multifamily housing complexes\nand commercial and industrial properties.\nCommercial real estate loans also includes\nloans extended to clients who warehouse assets\nthat are directly or indirectly backed by\ncommercial real estate. In addition,\ncommercial real estate includes loans\npurchased by the firm. \u2022 Residential Real\nEstate. Residential real estate loans\nprimarily includes loans extended to wealth\nmanagement clients and to clients who\nwarehouse assets that are directly or\nindirectly secured by residential real estate.\nIn addition, residential real estate includes\nloans purchased by the firm. \u2022 Securities-\nBased. Securities-based loans includes loans\nthat are secured by stocks, bonds, mutual\nfunds, and exchange-traded funds. These loans\nare primarily extended to the firm\u2019s wealth\nmanagement clients and used for purposes other\nthan purchasing, carrying or trading margin\nstocks. Securities-based loans require\nborrowers to post additional collateral based\non changes in the underlying collateral\u2019s fair\nvalue. \u2022 Other Collateralized. Other\ncollateralized loans includes loans that are\nbacked by specific collateral (other than\nsecurities and real estate). Such loans are\nextended to clients who warehouse assets that\nare directly or indirectly secured by\ncorporate loans, consumer loans and other\nassets. Other collateralized loans also\nincludes loans to investment funds (managed by\nthird parties) that are collateralized by\ncapital commitments of the funds\u2019 investors or\nassets held by the fund, as well as other\nsecured loans extended to the firm\u2019s wealth\nmanagement clients. \u2022 Installment. Installment\nloans are unsecured loans originated by the\nfirm. \u2022 Credit Cards. Credit card loans are\nloans made pursuant to revolving lines of\ncredit issued to consumers by the firm. \u2022\nOther. Other loans includes unsecured loans\nextended to wealth management clients and\nunsecured consumer and credit card loans\npurchased by the firm. See Note 4 for an\noverview of the firm\u2019s fair value measurement\npolicies, valuation techniques and significant\ninputs used to determine the fair value of\nloans, and Note 5 for information about loans\nwithin the fair value hierarchy. Credit\nQuality Risk Assessment. The firm\u2019s risk\nassessment process includes evaluating the\ncredit quality of its loans by the firm\u2019s\nindependent risk oversight and control\nfunction. For corporate loans and a majority\nof securities-based, real estate, other\ncollateralized and other loans, the firm\nperforms credit analyses which incorporate\ninitial and ongoing evaluations of the\ncapacity and willingness of a borrower to meet\nits financial obligations. These credit\nevaluations are performed on an annual basis\nor more frequently if deemed necessary as a\nresult of events or changes in circumstances.\nThe firm determines an internal credit rating\nfor the borrower by considering the results of\nthe credit evaluations and assumptions with\nrespect to the nature of and outlook for the\nborrower\u2019s industry and the economic\nenvironment. Beginning in the first quarter of\n2023, the firm also takes into consideration\ncollateral received or other credit support\narrangements when determining an internal\ncredit rating on collateralized loans, as\nmanagement believes that this methodology\nbetter reflects the credit quality of the\nunderlying loans. In the table below, prior\nperiod amounts have been conformed to reflect\nthe current methodology. The impact to\nDecember 2022 was an increase in loans\nclassified as investment-grade and a decrease\nin loans classified as non-investment-grade of\n$ 25.0billion in real estate (warehouse loans)\nand other collateralized loans. For consumer\nloans and for loans that are not assigned an\ninternal credit rating, the firm reviews\ncertain key metrics, including, but not\nlimited to, the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO)\ncredit scores, delinquency status, collateral\nvalue and other risk factors. Beginning in the\nfourth quarter of 2023, the firm began to\nassess the credit quality of all U.S.\nresidential mortgage loans extended to wealth\nmanagement clients using FICO credit scores,\nloan-to-value ratios and delinquency, instead\nof an internal credit rating, as the firm\nbelieves that these metrics better reflect the\ncredit quality of such loans. In the table\nbelow, prior period amounts have been\nconformed to reflect the current methodology.\nThe impact to residential real estate loans as\nof December 2022 was a decrease in loans\nclassified as investment-grade of $\n2.5billion, a decrease in loans classified as\nnon-investment-grade of $ 2.7billion and an\nincrease in other metrics of $ 5.2billion.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    169  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The allowance for\ncredit losses for such nonaccrual loans is\ndetermined by considering the fair value of\nthe collateral less estimated cost to sell, if\napplicable .\n\nIn certain circumstances, the firm may modify\nthe original terms of a loan agreement by\ngranting a concession to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty, typically\nin the form of a modification of loan\ncovenants, but may also include forbearance of\ninterest or principal, payment extensions or\ninterest rate reductions. These modifications,\nto the extent significant, were considered\nTDRs as of December 2022. In January 2023, the\nfirm adopted ASU No. 2022-02, which eliminated\nthe recognition and measurement guidance for\nTDRs and requires enhanced disclosures for\ncertain loan modifications. As of December\n2022, loans modified in a TDR were $\n231million and commitments related to such\nloans were not material. Substantially all of\nsuch loans modified in a TDR were related to\ncorporate and commercial real estate loans.\nDuring 2023, the firm provided loan\nmodifications (in the form of term extensions)\nto borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty. As of December 2023, the carrying\nvalue of loans modified during 2023 was $\n846million. Lending commitments related to\nsuch loans were not material and such loan\nmodifications were primarily related to\ncorporate and commercial real estate loans.\nThe impact of these modifications was not\nmaterial for 2023. During 2023, the firm\ncharged-off approximately $ 100million of\nloans that had defaulted after being modified.\nSubstantially all of the remaining modified\nloans were performing in accordance with the\nmodified contractual terms as of December\n2023. Allowance for Credit Losses The firm\u2019s\nallowance for credit losses consists of the\nallowance for losses on loans and lending\ncommitments accounted for at amortized cost.\nLoans and lending commitments accounted for at\nfair value or accounted for at the lower of\ncost or fair value are not subject to an\nallowance for credit losses. To determine the\nallowance for credit losses, the firm\nclassifies its loans and lending commitments\naccounted for at amortized cost into wholesale\nand consumer portfolios. These portfolios\nrepresent the level at which the firm has\ndeveloped and documented its methodology to\ndetermine the allowance for credit losses. The\nallowance for credit losses is measured on a\ncollective basis for loans that exhibit\nsimilar risk characteristics using a modeled\napproach and on an asset-specific basis for\nloans that do not share similar risk\ncharacteristics.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    173  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nThe allowance for credit losses takes into\naccount the weighted average of a range of\nforecasts of future economic conditions over\nthe expected life of the loan and lending\ncommitments. The expected life of each loan or\nlending commitment is determined based on the\ncontractual term adjusted for extension\noptions or demand features, or is modeled in\nthe case of revolving credit card loans. The\nforecasts include baseline, favorable and\nadverse economic scenarios over a three-year\nperiod. For loans with expected lives beyond\nthree years, the model reverts to historical\nloss information based on a non-linear modeled\napproach. The forecasted economic scenarios\nconsider a number of risk factors relevant to\nthe wholesale and consumer portfolios\ndescribed below. The firm applies judgment in\nweighing individual scenarios each quarter\nbased on a variety of factors, including the\nfirm\u2019s internally derived economic outlook,\nmarket consensus, recent macroeconomic\nconditions and industry trends. The allowance\nfor credit losses also includes qualitative\ncomponents which allow management to reflect\nthe uncertain nature of economic forecasting,\ncapture uncertainty regarding model inputs,\nand account for model imprecision and\nconcentration risk. Management\u2019s estimate of\ncredit losses entails judgment about the\nexpected life of the loan and loan\ncollectability at the reporting dates, and\nthere are uncertainties inherent in those\njudgments. The allowance for credit losses is\nsubject to a governance process that involves\nreview and approval by senior management\nwithin the firm\u2019s independent risk oversight\nand control functions. Personnel within the\nfirm\u2019s independent risk oversight and control\nfunctions are responsible for forecasting the\neconomic variables that underlie the economic\nscenarios that are used in the modeling of\nexpected credit losses. While management uses\nthe best information available to determine\nthis estimate, future adjustments to the\nallowance may be necessary based on, among\nother things, changes in the economic\nenvironment or variances between actual\nresults and the original assumptions used.\nThe table below\npresents gross loans\nand lending\ncommitments accounted\nfor at amortized cost\nby portfolio.\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026  \u2026        \u2026       \u2026  L\u2026        C\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       $  \u2026      $  \u2026      \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n                                              \n         \u2026        1          \u2026         \u2026      \n         \u2026        \u2026          \u2026         \u2026      \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       $  \u2026      $  \u2026      \n                                              \nIn the table above,\nwholesale loans\nincluded $ 4.14billion\nas of December 2023\nand $ 2.67billion as\nof December 2022 of\nnonaccrual loans for\nwhich the allowance\nfor credit losses was\nmeasured on an asset-\nspecific basis. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses on these loans\nwas $ 778million as of\nDecember 2023 and $\n535million as of\nDecember 2022. These\nloans included $\n625million as of\nDecember 2023 and $\n384million as of\nDecember 2022 of loans\nwhich did not require\na reserve as the loan\nwas deemed to be\nrecoverable. See Note\n18 for further\ninformation about\nlending commitments.\nThe following is a\ndescription of the\nmethodology used to\ncalculate the\nallowance for credit\nlosses: Wholesale. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses for wholesale\nloans and lending\ncommitments that\nexhibit similar risk\ncharacteristics is\nmeasured using a\nmodeled approach.\nThese models determine\nthe probability of\ndefault and loss given\ndefault based on\nvarious risk factors,\nincluding internal\ncredit ratings,\nindustry default and\nloss data, expected\nlife, macroeconomic\nindicators, the\nborrower\u2019s capacity to\nmeet its financial\nobligations, the\nborrower\u2019s country of\nrisk and industry,\nloan seniority and\ncollateral type. For\nlending commitments,\nthe methodology also\nconsiders the\nprobability of\ndrawdowns or funding.\nIn addition, for loans\nbacked by real estate,\nrisk factors include\nthe loan-to-value\nratio, debt service\nratio and home price\nindex. The most\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model for\nwholesale loans and\nlending commitments\ninclude unemployment\nrates, GDP, credit\nspreads, commercial\nand industrial\ndelinquency rates,\nshort- and long-term\ninterest rates, and\noil prices.\n                                       \n  174    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\nallowance for credit\nlosses for consumer\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics is\ncalculated using a\nmodeled approach which\nclassifies consumer\nloans into pools based\non borrower-related\nand exposure-related\ncharacteristics that\ndifferentiate a pool\u2019s\nrisk characteristics\nfrom other pools. The\nfactors considered in\ndetermining a pool are\ngenerally consistent\nwith the risk\ncharacteristics used\nfor internal credit\nrisk measurement and\nmanagement and include\nkey metrics, such as\nFICO credit scores,\ndelinquency status,\nloan vintage and\nmacroeconomic\nindicators. The most\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model for\nconsumer loans include\nunemployment rates and\ndelinquency rates. The\nexpected life of\nrevolving credit card\nloans is determined by\nmodeling expected\nfuture draws and the\ntiming and amount of\nrepayments allocated\nto the funded balance.\nThe firm also\nrecognizes an\nallowance for credit\nlosses on commitments\nto acquire loans.\nHowever, no allowance\nfor credit losses is\nrecognized on credit\ncard lending\ncommitments as they\nare cancellable by the\nfirm. Installment\nloans are charged off\nwhen they are 120 days\npast due. Credit card\nloans are charged off\nwhen they are 180 days\npast due.\n\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses Rollforward\nThe table below\npresents information\nabout the allowance\nfor credit losses.\n

In\nthis scenario, the\nU.S. unemployment rate\npeaks at approximately\n7.1% during the first\nquarter of 2025 and\nthe maximum decline in\nthe quarterly U.S. GDP\nrelative to the fourth\nquarter of 2023 is\napproximately 2.7%,\nwhich occurs during\nthe fourth quarter of\n2024.\nIn the table above:\n\u2022 U.S. unemployment\nrate represents the\nrate forecasted as of\nthe respective\nquarter-end.\n\u2022 Growth in U.S. GDP\nrepresents the year-\nover-year growth rate\nforecasted for the\nrespective years.\n\u2022 While the U.S.\nunemployment and U.S.\nGDP growth rates are\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model,\nthe model contemplates\na variety of other\ninputs across a range\nof scenarios to\nprovide a forecast of\nfuture economic\nconditions. Given the\ncomplex nature of the\nforecasting process,\nno single economic\nvariable can be viewed\nin isolation and\nindependently of other\ninputs.\n\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses Commentary Year\nEnded December 2023.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses\ndecreased by $\n647million during\n2023, reflecting a net\nrelease related to the\nGreenSky installment\nloan portfolio\n(including a reserve\nreduction of $\n637million related to\nthe partial sale and\ntransfer of the\nportfolio to held for\nsale), a reserve\nreduction of $\n442million associated\nwith the sale of\nMarcus loans, a\nreserve reduction of $\n160million related to\nthe transfer of the GM\nco-branded credit card\nportfolio to held for\nsale, a reserve\nrelease in the\nconsumer portfolio\nbased on actual\nrepayment experience\nand lower balances in\ncorporate loans due to\nsales and paydowns,\npartially offset by\nasset-specific\nprovisions and ratings\ndowngrades in the\nwholesale portfolio\nand seasoning of the\ncredit card portfolio.\nCharge-offs for 2023\nfor wholesale loans\n(principally related\nto term loans\noriginated in 2021 and\nrevolving loans) were\nprimarily related to\ncorporate loans and\ncharge-offs for\nconsumer loans were\nprimarily related to\ncredit cards. Year\nEnded December 2022.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses\nincreased by $\n1.97billion during\n2022, reflecting\ngrowth in the firm\u2019s\nconsumer lending\nportfolio (principally\nin credit cards) and\nhigher modeled\nexpected losses due to\nbroad macroeconomic\nand geopolitical\nconcerns. In addition,\nthe allowance for\ncredit losses for\nwholesale loans was\nimpacted by asset-\nspecific provisions\nand ratings downgrades\nprimarily related to\nborrowers in the\ntechnology, media &\ntelecommunications,\nreal estate, and\nconsumer & retail\nindustries. Charge-\noffs for 2022 for\nwholesale loans were\nprimarily related to\ncorporate loans and\ncharge-offs for\nconsumer loans were\nprimarily related to\ncredit cards.\nEstimated Fair Value\nThe table below\npresents the estimated\nfair value of loans\nthat are not accounted\nfor at fair value and\nin what level of the\nfair value hierarchy\nthey would have been\nclassified if they had\nbeen included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value\nhierarchy.\n                                              \n                       \u2026                      \n            \u2026    \u2026     \u2026  \u2026                   \n            \u2026    2     \u2026  3         \u2026         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026          $  \u2026     $  8\u2026     $  1\u2026  \n      $  \u2026          $  \u2026     $  3\u2026     $  7\u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026          $  \u2026     $  8\u2026     $  1\u2026  \n      $  \u2026          $  \u2026     $  2\u2026     $  4\u2026  \n                                              \nSee Note 4 for an\noverview of the firm\u2019s\nfair value measurement\npolicies, valuation\ntechniques and\nsignificant inputs\nused to determine the\nfair value of loans,\nand Note 5 for\ninformation about\nloans within the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\n                                       \n  176    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Fair Value\nOption Other Financial\nAssets and Liabilities\nat Fair Value In\naddition to trading\nassets and\nliabilities, and\ncertain investments\nand loans, the firm\naccounts for certain\nof its other financial\nassets and liabilities\nat fair value,\nsubstantially all\nunder the fair value\noption. The primary\nreasons for electing\nthe fair value option\nare to: \u2022 Reflect\neconomic events in\nearnings on a timely\nbasis; \u2022 Mitigate\nvolatility in earnings\nfrom using different\nmeasurement attributes\n(e.g., transfers of\nfinancial assets\naccounted for as\nfinancings are\nrecorded at fair\nvalue, whereas the\nrelated secured\nfinancing would be\nrecorded on an accrual\nbasis absent electing\nthe fair value\noption); and \u2022 Address\nsimplification and\ncost-benefit\nconsiderations (e.g.,\naccounting for hybrid\nfinancial instruments\nat fair value in their\nentirety versus\nbifurcation of\nembedded derivatives\nand hedge accounting\nfor debt hosts).\nHybrid financial\ninstruments are\ninstruments that\ncontain bifurcatable\nembedded derivatives\nand do not require\nsettlement by physical\ndelivery of\nnonfinancial assets\n(e.g., physical\ncommodities). If the\nfirm elects to\nbifurcate the embedded\nderivative from the\nassociated debt, the\nderivative is\naccounted for at fair\nvalue and the host\ncontract is accounted\nfor at amortized cost,\nadjusted for the\neffective portion of\nany fair value hedges.\nIf the firm does not\nelect to bifurcate,\nthe entire hybrid\nfinancial instrument\nis accounted for at\nfair value under the\nfair value option.\nOther financial assets\nand liabilities\naccounted for at fair\nvalue under the fair\nvalue option include:\n\u2022 Repurchase\nagreements and\nsubstantially all\nresale agreements; \u2022\nCertain securities\nborrowed and loaned\ntransactions; \u2022\nCertain customer and\nother receivables and\ncertain other assets\nand liabilities; \u2022\nCertain time deposits\n(deposits with no\nstated maturity are\nnot eligible for a\nfair value option\nelection), including\nstructured\ncertificates of\ndeposit, which are\nhybrid financial\ninstruments; \u2022\nSubstantially all\nother secured\nfinancings, including\ntransfers of assets\naccounted for as\nfinancings; and \u2022\nCertain unsecured\nshort- and long-term\nborrowings,\nsubstantially all of\nwhich are hybrid\nfinancial instruments.\n\nSee Note 4 for an\noverview of the firm\u2019s\nfair value measurement\npolicies, valuation\ntechniques and\nsignificant inputs\nused to determine the\nfair value of other\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities, and Note\n5 for information\nabout other financial\nassets and liabilities\nwithin the fair value\nhierarchy.

See\nNote 18 for further\ninformation about\nlending commitments.\n\nImpact of Credit\nSpreads on Loans and\nLending Commitments\nThe estimated net\ngain/(loss)\nattributable to\nchanges in instrument-\nspecific credit\nspreads on loans and\nlending commitments\nfor which the fair\nvalue option was\nelected was $( 125)\nmillion for 2023, $(\n281) million for 2022\nand $ 277million for\n2021. The firm\ngenerally calculates\nthe fair value of\nloans and lending\ncommitments for which\nthe fair value option\nis elected by\ndiscounting future\ncash flows at a rate\nwhich incorporates the\ninstrument-specific\ncredit spreads. For\nfloating-rate loans\nand lending\ncommitments,\nsubstantially all\nchanges in fair value\nare attributable to\nchanges in instrument-\nspecific credit\nspreads, whereas for\nfixed-rate loans and\nlending commitments,\nchanges in fair value\nare also attributable\nto changes in interest\nrates.\n                                       \n  178    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm enters into these\ntransactions in order to, among other things,\nfacilitate client activities, invest excess\ncash, acquire securities to cover short\npositions and finance certain firm activities.\nCollateralized agreements and financings with\nthe same settlement date are presented on a\nnet-by-counterparty basis when such\ntransactions meet certain settlement criteria\nand are subject to netting agreements.\nInterest on collateralized agreements, which\nis included in interest income, and\ncollateralized financings, which is included\nin interest expense, is recognized over the\nlife of the transaction. See Note 23 for\nfurther information about interest income and\ninterest expense. Resale and Repurchase\nAgreements A resale agreement is a transaction\nin which the firm purchases financial\ninstruments from a seller, typically in\nexchange for cash, and simultaneously enters\ninto an agreement to resell the same or\nsubstantially the same financial instruments\nto the seller at a stated price plus accrued\ninterest at a future date. A repurchase\nagreement is a transaction in which the firm\nsells financial instruments to a buyer,\ntypically in exchange for cash, and\nsimultaneously enters into an agreement to\nrepurchase the same or substantially the same\nfinancial instruments from the buyer at a\nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. Even though repurchase and resale\nagreements (including \u201crepos- and reverses-to-\nmaturity\u201d) involve the legal transfer of\nownership of financial instruments, they are\naccounted for as financing arrangements\nbecause they require the financial instruments\nto be repurchased or resold before or at the\nmaturity of the agreement. The financial\ninstruments purchased or sold in resale and\nrepurchase agreements typically include U.S.\ngovernment and agency obligations, and\ninvestment-grade sovereign obligations. The\nfirm receives financial instruments purchased\nunder resale agreements and makes delivery of\nfinancial instruments sold under repurchase\nagreements. To mitigate credit exposure, the\nfirm monitors the market value of these\nfinancial instruments on a daily basis, and\ndelivers or obtains additional collateral due\nto changes in the market value of the\nfinancial instruments, as appropriate. For\nresale agreements, the firm typically requires\ncollateral with a fair value approximately\nequal to the carrying value of the relevant\nassets in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nRepurchase agreements and substantially all\nresale agreements are recorded at fair value\nunder the fair value option. See Note 5 for\nfurther information about repurchase and\nresale agreements. Securities Borrowed and\nLoaned Transactions In a securities borrowed\ntransaction, the firm borrows securities from\na counterparty in exchange for cash or\nsecurities. When the firm returns the\nsecurities, the counterparty returns the cash\nor securities. Interest is generally paid\nperiodically over the life of the transaction.\nIn a securities loaned transaction, the firm\nlends securities to a counterparty in exchange\nfor cash or securities. When the counterparty\nreturns the securities, the firm returns the\ncash or securities posted as collateral.\nInterest is generally paid periodically over\nthe life of the transaction. In a transaction\nwhere the firm lends securities and receives\nsecurities that can be delivered or pledged as\ncollateral, the firm recognizes the securities\nreceived within securities borrowed and the\nobligation to return those securities within\nsecurities loaned in the consolidated balance\nsheets. The firm receives securities borrowed\nand makes delivery of securities loaned. To\nmitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors\nthe market value of these securities on a\ndaily basis, and delivers or obtains\nadditional collateral due to changes in the\nmarket value of the securities, as\nappropriate. For securities borrowed\ntransactions, the firm typically requires\ncollateral with a fair value approximately\nequal to the carrying value of the securities\nborrowed transaction. Securities borrowed and\nloaned within FICC financing are recorded at\nfair value under the fair value option. See\nNote 5 for further information about\nsecurities borrowed and loaned accounted for\nat fair value. Substantially all of the\nsecurities borrowed and loaned within Equities\nfinancing are recorded based on the amount of\ncash collateral advanced or received plus\naccrued interest. The firm also reviews such\nsecurities borrowed to determine if an\nallowance for credit losses should be recorded\nby taking into consideration the fair value of\ncollateral received. As these agreements\ngenerally can be terminated on demand, they\nexhibit little, if any, sensitivity to changes\nin interest rates. Therefore, the carrying\nvalue of such agreements approximates fair\nvalue. As these agreements are not accounted\nfor at fair value, they are not included in\nthe firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and\n5. Had these agreements been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, they would have\nbeen classified in level 2 as of both December\n2023 and December 2022.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    179  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Other secured financings\nincluded nonrecourse arrangements. Nonrecourse\nother secured financings were $ 5.57billion as\nof December 2023 and $ 7.94billion as of\nDecember 2022. The firm has elected to apply\nthe fair value option to substantially all\nother secured financings because the use of\nfair value eliminates non-economic volatility\nin earnings that would arise from using\ndifferent measurement attributes. See Note 10\nfor further information about other secured\nfinancings that are accounted for at fair\nvalue. Other secured financings that are not\nrecorded at fair value are recorded based on\nthe amount of cash received plus accrued\ninterest, which generally approximates fair\nvalue. As these financings are not accounted\nfor at fair value, they are not included in\nthe firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and\n5. Had these financings been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, substantially all\nwould have been classified in level 3 as of\nboth December 2023 and December 2022.\nThe table below

When\nassessing goodwill for impairment, first, a\nqualitative assessment can be made to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not\nthat the estimated fair value of a reporting\nunit is less than its carrying value. If the\nresults of the qualitative assessment are not\nconclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is\nperformed. Alternatively, a quantitative\ngoodwill test can be performed without\nperforming a qualitative assessment. The\nquantitative goodwill test compares the\nestimated fair value of each reporting unit\nwith its carrying value (including goodwill\nand identifiable intangible assets). If the\nreporting unit\u2019s estimated fair value exceeds\nits carrying value, goodwill is not impaired.\nAn impairment is recognized if the estimated\nfair value of a reporting unit is less than\nits carrying value and any such impairment is\nincluded in depreciation and amortization.\nWhen performing a quantitative goodwill test,\nthe estimated fair value of each reporting\nunit is based on valuation techniques the firm\nbelieves market participants would use to\nvalue these reporting units. Estimated fair\nvalues are generally derived from utilizing a\nrelative value technique, which applies\nobservable price-to-earnings multiples or\nprice-to-book multiples of comparable\ncompetitors to the reporting units\u2019 net\nearnings or net book value, or a discounted\ncash flow valuation approach, for reporting\nunits with businesses in early stages of\ndevelopment. The carrying value of each\nreporting unit reflects an allocation of total\nshareholders\u2019 equity and represents the\nestimated amount of total shareholders\u2019 equity\nrequired to support the activities of the\nreporting unit under currently applicable\nregulatory capital requirements. During the\nfirst quarter of 2023, goodwill for Consumer\nplatforms increased by $ 22million as a result\nof an updated purchase price allocation\nrelated to the GreenSky acquisition. During\nthe second quarter of 2023, in connection with\nthe exploration of a potential sale of\nGreenSky, the firm performed a quantitative\ngoodwill test and determined that the goodwill\nassociated with Consumer platforms was\nimpaired, and accordingly, recorded a $\n504million impairment. In the fourth quarter\nof 2023, the firm performed its annual\nassessment of goodwill for impairment, for\neach of its reporting units with goodwill, by\nperforming a qualitative assessment. Multiple\nfactors were assessed with respect to each of\nthese reporting units to determine whether it\nwas more likely than not that the estimated\nfair value of each of those reporting units\nwas less than its carrying value. The\nqualitative assessment also considered changes\nsince a quantitative test across all of the\nfirm's reporting units was last performed in\n2022. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the\nfirm considered the following factors in the\nqualitative annual assessment: \u2022 Performance\nIndicators. For 2023, the firm generated\nhigher net revenues net of provision for\ncredit losses and increased book value per\nshare, although overall performance declined\ncompared with 2022. This decline reflected the\nfirm\u2019s continued execution on the narrowing of\nits strategic focus, which had a negative\nimpact on net earnings. Within the reporting\nunits with goodwill, there continued to be\nsolid fundamentals underlying our businesses,\nwhere the firm continued to maintain industry\nleadership positions and execute on strategic\ngoals. \u2022 Macroeconomic Indicators. Despite\nbroad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns,\nthe global economy continued to grow in 2023.\n\u2022 Firm and Industry Events. There were no\nevents, entity-specific or otherwise, that\nwould have had a significant negative impact\non the valuation of the firm\u2019s reporting units\nwith goodwill. \u2022 Fair Value Indicators. Since\nthe 2022 quantitative test, changes in the\nfair value indicators in the market did not\nhave a significant negative impact on the\nvaluation of the firm\u2019s reporting units with\ngoodwill. As a result of the qualitative\nassessment, the firm determined that it was\nmore likely than not that the estimated fair\nvalue of each reporting unit with goodwill\nexceeded its respective carrying value.\nTherefore, the firm determined that goodwill\nfor each reporting unit was not impaired and\nthat a quantitative goodwill test was not\nrequired.\n                                       \n  184    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

To the\nextent the carrying\nvalue of an asset or\nasset group exceeds\nthe projected\nundiscounted cash\nflows expected to\nresult from the use\nand eventual disposal\nof the asset or asset\ngroup, the firm\ndetermines the asset\nor asset group is\nimpaired and records\nan impairment equal to\nthe difference between\nthe estimated fair\nvalue and the carrying\nvalue of the asset or\nasset group. In\naddition, the firm\nwill recognize an\nimpairment prior to\nthe sale of an asset\nor asset group if the\ncarrying value of the\nasset or asset group\nexceeds its estimated\nfair value. Other than\nas noted above, there\nwere no material\nimpairments or write-\ndowns during 2023,\n2022 or 2021.\nOperating Lease Right-\nof-Use Assets The firm\nenters into operating\nleases for real\nestate, office\nequipment and other\nassets, substantially\nall of which are used\nin connection with its\noperations. For leases\nlonger than one year,\nthe firm recognizes a\nright-of-use asset\nrepresenting the right\nto use the underlying\nasset for the lease\nterm, and a lease\nliability representing\nthe liability to make\npayments. The lease\nterm is generally\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual\nmaturity of the lease.\nFor leases where the\nfirm has the option to\nterminate or extend\nthe lease, an\nassessment of the\nlikelihood of\nexercising the option\nis incorporated into\nthe determination of\nthe lease term. Such\nassessment is\ninitially performed at\nthe inception of the\nlease and is updated\nif events occur that\nimpact the original\nassessment. An\noperating lease right-\nof-use asset is\ninitially determined\nbased on the operating\nlease liability,\nadjusted for initial\ndirect costs, lease\nincentives and amounts\npaid at or prior to\nlease commencement.\nThis amount is then\namortized over the\nlease term.Right-of-\nuse assets and\noperating lease\nliabilities recognized\n(in non-cash\ntransactions for\nleases entered into or\nassumed) by the firm\nwere $ 333million for\n2023, $ 256million for\n2022 and $ 305million\nfor 2021.

Securitization\nActivities The firm securitizes residential\nand commercial mortgages, corporate bonds,\nloans and other types of financial assets by\nselling these assets to securitization\nvehicles (e.g., trusts, corporate entities and\nlimited liability companies) or through a\nresecuritization. The firm acts as underwriter\nof the beneficial interests that are sold to\ninvestors. The firm\u2019s residential mortgage\nsecuritizations are primarily in connection\nwith government agency securitizations. The\nfirm accounts for a securitization as a sale\nwhen it has relinquished control over the\ntransferred financial assets. Prior to\nsecuritization, the firm generally accounts\nfor assets pending transfer at fair value and\ntherefore does not typically recognize\nsignificant gains or losses upon the transfer\nof assets. Net revenues from underwriting\nactivities are recognized in connection with\nthe sales of the underlying beneficial\ninterests to investors.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    191  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\nprimary risks included\nin beneficial\ninterests and other\ninterests from the\nfirm\u2019s continuing\ninvolvement with\nsecuritization\nvehicles are the\nperformance of the\nunderlying collateral,\nthe position of the\nfirm\u2019s investment in\nthe capital structure\nof the securitization\nvehicle and the market\nyield for the\nsecurity. Interests\naccounted for at fair\nvalue are primarily\nclassified in level 2\nof the fair value\nhierarchy.

Due to the\nnature and fair value of certain of these\nretained interests, the weighted average\nassumptions for constant prepayment and\ndiscount rates and the related sensitivity to\nadverse changes are not meaningful as of both\nDecember 2023 and December 2022.

Variable Interest Entities A variable\ninterest in a VIE is an investment (e.g., debt\nor equity) or other interest (e.g.,\nderivatives or loans and lending commitments)\nthat will absorb portions of the VIE\u2019s\nexpected losses and/or receive portions of the\nVIE\u2019s expected residual returns. The firm\u2019s\nvariable interests in VIEs include senior and\nsubordinated debt; loans and lending\ncommitments; limited and general partnership\ninterests; preferred and common equity;\nderivatives that may include foreign currency,\nequity and/or credit risk; guarantees; and\ncertain of the fees the firm receives from\ninvestment funds. Certain interest rate,\nforeign currency and credit derivatives the\nfirm enters into with VIEs are not variable\ninterests because they create, rather than\nabsorb, risk. VIEs generally finance the\npurchase of assets by issuing debt and equity\nsecurities that are either collateralized by\nor indexed to the assets held by the VIE. The\ndebt and equity securities issued by a VIE may\ninclude tranches of varying levels of\nsubordination. The firm\u2019s involvement with\nVIEs includes securitization of financial\nassets, as described in Note 16, and\ninvestments in and loans to other types of\nVIEs, as described below. See Note 3 for the\nfirm\u2019s consolidation policies, including the\ndefinition of a VIE. VIE Consolidation\nAnalysis The enterprise with a controlling\nfinancial interest in a VIE is known as the\nprimary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE.\nThe firm determines whether it is the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis\nthat principally considers: \u2022 Which variable\ninterest holder has the power to direct the\nactivities of the VIE that most significantly\nimpact the VIE\u2019s economic performance; \u2022 Which\nvariable interest holder has the obligation to\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits\nfrom the VIE that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE; \u2022 The VIE\u2019s purpose\nand design, including the risks the VIE was\ndesigned to create and pass through to its\nvariable interest holders; \u2022 The VIE\u2019s capital\nstructure; \u2022 The terms between the VIE and its\nvariable interest holders and other parties\ninvolved with the VIE; and \u2022 Related-party\nrelationships. The firm reassesses its\nevaluation of whether an entity is a VIE when\ncertain reconsideration events occur. The firm\nreassesses its determination of whether it is\nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing\nbasis based on current facts and\ncircumstances.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    193  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm\npurchases and sells\nbeneficial interests\nissued by mortgage-\nbacked VIEs in\nconnection with\nmarket-making\nactivities. In\naddition, the firm may\nenter into derivatives\nwith certain of these\nVIEs, primarily\ninterest rate swaps,\nwhich are typically\nnot variable\ninterests. The firm\ngenerally enters into\nderivatives with other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk.\nReal Estate, Credit-\nand Power-Related and\nOther Investing VIEs.\nThe firm purchases\nequity and debt\nsecurities issued by\nand makes loans to\nVIEs that hold real\nestate (including\nqualified affordable\nhousing projects),\nperforming and\nnonperforming debt,\ndistressed loans,\npower-related assets\nand equity securities.\nThe firm generally\ndoes not sell assets\nto, or enter into\nderivatives with,\nthese VIEs. Corporate\nDebt and Other Asset-\nBacked VIEs. The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue notes to\nclients, purchases and\nsells beneficial\ninterests issued by\ncorporate debt and\nother asset-backed\nVIEs in connection\nwith market-making\nactivities, and makes\nloans to VIEs that\nwarehouse corporate\ndebt. Certain of these\nVIEs synthetically\ncreate the exposure\nfor the beneficial\ninterests they issue\nby entering into\ncredit derivatives\nwith the firm, rather\nthan purchasing the\nunderlying assets. In\naddition, the firm may\nenter into\nderivatives, such as\ntotal return swaps,\nwith certain corporate\ndebt and other asset-\nbacked VIEs, under\nwhich the firm pays\nthe VIE a return due\nto the beneficial\ninterest holders and\nreceives the return on\nthe collateral owned\nby the VIE. The\ncollateral owned by\nthese VIEs is\nprimarily other asset-\nbacked loans and\nsecurities. The firm\nmay be removed as the\ntotal return swap\ncounterparty and may\nenter into derivatives\nwith other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk\nrelated to these\nswaps. The firm may\nsell assets to the\ncorporate debt and\nother asset-backed\nVIEs it structures.\n\nPrincipal-Protected\nNote VIEs. The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue principal-\nprotected notes to\nclients. These VIEs\nown portfolios of\nassets, principally\nwith exposure to hedge\nfunds. Substantially\nall of the principal\nprotection on the\nnotes issued by these\nVIEs is provided by\nthe asset portfolio\nrebalancing that is\nrequired under the\nterms of the notes.\nThe firm enters into\ntotal return swaps\nwith these VIEs under\nwhich the firm pays\nthe VIE the return due\nto the principal-\nprotected note holders\nand receives the\nreturn on the assets\nowned by the VIE.

The firm also extends\nlending commitments in connection with other\ntypes of corporate lending, commercial real\nestate financing and other collateralized\nlending.See Note 9 for further information\nabout funded loans. To mitigate the credit\nrisk associated with the firm\u2019s commercial\nlending activities, the firm obtains credit\nprotection on certain loans and lending\ncommitments through credit default swaps, both\nsingle-name and index-based contracts, and\nthrough the issuance of credit-linked notes.\nWarehouse Financing.

The\nimpact of recognizing\nthese commitments\nwithin other assets\nand other liabilities\nas of December 2022,\nwould have been an\nincrease in both other\nassets and other\nliabilities and a\ndecrease in investment\ncommitments of $\n1.13billion.\nContingencies Legal\nProceedings.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nDerivative Guarantees. The firm enters into\nvarious derivatives that meet the definition\nof a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including\nwritten equity and commodity put options,\nwritten currency contracts and interest rate\ncaps, floors and swaptions. These derivatives\nare risk managed together with derivatives\nthat do not meet the definition of a\nguarantee, and therefore the amounts in the\ntable above do not reflect the firm\u2019s overall\nrisk related to derivative activities.\nDisclosures about derivatives are not required\nif they may be cash settled and the firm has\nno basis to conclude it is probable that the\ncounterparties held the underlying instruments\nat the inception of the contract. The firm has\nconcluded that these conditions have been met\nfor certain large, internationally active\ncommercial and investment bank counterparties,\ncentral clearing counterparties, hedge funds\nand certain other counterparties. Accordingly,\nthe firm has not included such contracts in\nthe table above. See Note 7 for information\nabout credit derivatives that meet the\ndefinition of a guarantee, which are not\nincluded in the table above. Derivatives are\naccounted for at fair value and therefore the\ncarrying value is considered the best\nindication of payment/performance risk for\nindividual contracts. However, the carrying\nvalues in the table above exclude the effect\nof counterparty and cash collateral netting.\nSecurities Lending and Clearing Guarantees .\nSecurities lending and clearing guarantees\ninclude the indemnifications and guarantees\nthat the firm provides in its capacity as an\nagency lender and in its capacity as a\nsponsoring member of the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. As an agency lender, the firm\nindemnifies most of its securities lending\ncustomers against losses incurred in the event\nthat borrowers do not return securities and\nthe collateral held is insufficient to cover\nthe market value of the securities\nborrowed.The maximum payout of such\nindemnifications was $ 14.19billion as of\nDecember 2023 and $ 12.23billion as of\nDecember 2022. Collateral held by the lenders\nin connection with securities lending\nindemnifications was $ 14.63 billionas of\nDecember 2023 and $ 12.62 billionas of\nDecember 2022. Because the contractual nature\nof these arrangements requires the firm to\nobtain collateral with a market value that\nexceeds the value of the securities lent to\nthe borrower, there is minimal performance\nrisk associated with these indemnifications.\nAs a sponsoring member of the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation, the firm guarantees the\nperformance of its sponsored member clients to\nthe Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in\nconnection with certain resale and repurchase\nagreements. To minimize potential losses on\nsuch guarantees, the firm obtains a security\ninterest in the collateral that the sponsored\nclient placed with the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. Therefore, the risk of loss on\nsuch guarantees is minimal. The maximum payout\non this guarantee was $ 14.60billion as of\nDecember 2023 and $ 8.74billion as of December\n2022. The related collateral held was $ 14.69\nbillionas of December 2023 and $ 8.70\nbillionas of December 2022. Other Financial\nGuarantees . In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, the firm provides other financial\nguarantees of the obligations of third parties\n(e.g., standby letters of credit and other\nguarantees to enable clients to complete\ntransactions and fund-related guarantees).\nThese guarantees represent obligations to make\npayments to beneficiaries if the guaranteed\nparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a\ncontractual arrangement with that\nbeneficiary.Other financial guarantees also\ninclude a guarantee that the firm has provided\nto the Government of Malaysia that it will\nreceive, by August 2025, at least $ 1.4billion\nin assets and proceeds from assets seized by\ngovernmental authorities around the world\nrelated to 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a\nsovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB). In\nconnection with this guarantee, the firm\nagreed to make a one-time interim payment of $\n250million towards the $ 1.4billion if the\nGovernment of Malaysia did not receive at\nleast $ 500million in assets and proceeds by\nAugust 2022. The firm does not believe that\nany interim payment is required. Any amounts\npaid by the firm would, in any event, be\nsubject to reimbursement in the event the\nassets and proceeds received by the Government\nof Malaysia through August 18, 2028 exceed $\n1.4billion. On October 11, 2023, the firm\nfiled a demand for arbitration alleging that\nthe Government of Malaysia had, as of August\n2022, recovered assets and proceeds well in\nexcess of $ 500million; it had recovered\nsubstantial additional assets and proceeds\nthat should be credited against the guarantee;\nand it had not used all reasonable efforts to\nrecover other assets and proceeds that could\nbe credited against the guarantee. On November\n8, 2023, the Government of Malaysia filed a\nresponse to the firm\u2019s demand for arbitration\nin which it stated that it intends to\ncounterclaim for payment of the interim\npayment (plus interest) on the basis that it\nhad recovered less than $ 500million as of\nAugust 2022. The arbitral process is ongoing.\nSee Note 27 for further information about\nmatters related to 1MDB.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    199  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nGuarantees of\nSecurities Issued by\nTrusts. The firm has\nestablished trusts,\nincluding Goldman\nSachs Capital I,\nGoldman Sachs Capital\nII and Goldman Sachs\nCapital III (the\nTrusts), and other\nentities, for the\nlimited purpose of\nissuing securities to\nthird parties, lending\nthe proceeds to the\nfirm and entering into\ncontractual\narrangements with the\nfirm and third parties\nrelated to this\npurpose. The firm does\nnot consolidate these\nentities. See Notes 14\nand 19 for further\ninformation about the\ntransactions involving\nthe Trusts. The firm\neffectively provides\nfor the full and\nunconditional\nguarantee of the\nsecurities issued by\nthese entities. Timely\npayment by the firm of\namounts due to these\nentities under the\nguarantee, borrowing,\npreferred stock and\nrelated contractual\narrangements will be\nsufficient to cover\npayments due on the\nsecurities issued by\nthese entities. No\nsubsidiary of Group\nInc. guarantees the\nsecurities of the\nTrusts. Management\nbelieves that it is\nunlikely that any\ncircumstances will\noccur, such as\nnonperformance on the\npart of paying agents\nor other service\nproviders, that would\nmake it necessary for\nthe firm to make\npayments related to\nthese entities other\nthan those required\nunder the terms of the\nguarantee, borrowing,\npreferred stock and\nrelated contractual\narrangements and in\nconnection with\ncertain expenses\nincurred by these\nentities. Indemnities\nand Guarantees of\nService Providers. In\nthe ordinary course of\nbusiness, the firm\nindemnifies and\nguarantees certain\nservice providers,\nsuch as clearing and\ncustody agents,\ntrustees and\nadministrators,\nagainst specified\npotential losses in\nconnection with their\nacting as an agent of,\nor providing services\nto, the firm or its\naffiliates. The firm\nmay also be liable to\nsome clients or other\nparties for losses\narising from its\ncustodial role or\ncaused by acts or\nomissions of third-\nparty service\nproviders, including\nsub-custodians and\nthird-party brokers.\nIn certain cases, the\nfirm has the right to\nseek indemnification\nfrom these third-party\nservice providers for\ncertain relevant\nlosses incurred by the\nfirm. In addition, the\nfirm is a member of\npayment, clearing and\nsettlement networks,\nas well as securities\nexchanges around the\nworld that may require\nthe firm to meet the\nobligations of such\nnetworks and exchanges\nin the event of member\ndefaults and other\nloss scenarios. In\nconnection with the\nfirm\u2019s prime brokerage\nand clearing\nbusinesses, the firm\nagrees to clear and\nsettle transactions\nentered into by\nclients with other\nbrokerage firms. The\nfirm\u2019s obligations in\nrespect of such\ntransactions are\nsecured by the assets\nin the client\u2019s\naccount and proceeds\nreceived from the\ntransactions cleared\nand settled by the\nfirm on behalf of the\nclient. In connection\nwith joint venture\ninvestments, the firm\nmay issue loan\nguarantees under which\nit may be liable in\nthe event of fraud,\nmisappropriation,\nenvironmental\nliabilities and other\nmatters involving the\nborrower.\n\nThe firm is unable to\ndevelop an estimate of\nthe maximum payout\nunder these guarantees\nand indemnifications.\nHowever, management\nbelieves that it is\nunlikely the firm will\nhave to make any\nmaterial payments\nunder these\narrangements, and no\nmaterial liabilities\nrelated to these\nguarantees and\nindemnifications have\nbeen recognized in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets as of both\nDecember 2023 and\nDecember 2022. Other\nRepresentations,\nWarranties and\nIndemnifications. The\nfirm provides\nrepresentations and\nwarranties to\ncounterparties in\nconnection with a\nvariety of commercial\ntransactions and\noccasionally\nindemnifies them\nagainst potential\nlosses caused by the\nbreach of those\nrepresentations and\nwarranties. The firm\nmay also provide\nindemnifications\nprotecting against\nchanges in or adverse\napplication of certain\nU.S. tax laws in\nconnection with\nordinary-course\ntransactions, such as\nsecurities issuances,\nborrowings or\nderivatives. In\naddition, the firm may\nprovide\nindemnifications to\nsome counterparties to\nprotect them in the\nevent additional taxes\nare owed or payments\nare withheld, due\neither to a change in\nor an adverse\napplication of certain\nnon-U.S. tax laws.\nThese\nindemnifications, as\nwell as\nindemnifications\nprovided by the firm\non other contractual\nor other obligations,\ngenerally are standard\ncontractual terms and\nare entered into in\nthe ordinary course of\nbusiness. Generally,\nthere are no stated or\nnotional amounts\nincluded in these\nindemnifications, and\nthe contingencies\ntriggering the\nobligation to\nindemnify are not\nexpected to occur. The\nfirm is unable to\ndevelop an estimate of\nthe maximum payout\nunder these guarantees\nand indemnifications.\nHowever, management\nbelieves that it is\nunlikely the firm will\nhave to make any\nmaterial payments\nunder these\narrangements, and no\nmaterial liabilities\nrelated to these\narrangements have been\nrecognized in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets as of both\nDecember 2023 and\nDecember 2022.\nGuarantees of\nSubsidiaries. Group\nInc. is the entity\nthat fully and\nunconditionally\nguarantees the\nsecurities issued by\nGS Finance Corp., a\nwholly-owned finance\nsubsidiary of the\nfirm. Group Inc. has\nguaranteed the payment\nobligations of Goldman\nSachs & Co. LLC\n(GS&Co.), GS Bank USA\nand Goldman Sachs\nParis Inc. et Cie,\nsubject to certain\nexceptions. In\naddition, Group Inc.\nhas provided\nguarantees to Goldman\nSachs International\n(GSI) and GSBE related\nto agreements that\neach entity has\nentered into with\ncertain of its\ncounterparties. Group\nInc. guarantees many\nof the obligations of\nits other consolidated\nsubsidiaries on a\ntransaction-by-\ntransaction basis, as\nnegotiated with\ncounterparties. Group\nInc. is unable to\ndevelop an estimate of\nthe maximum payout\nunder its subsidiary\nguarantees.

Regulation and Capital Adequacy The\nFRB is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a\nbank holding company under the U.S. Bank\nHolding Company Act of 1956 and a financial\nholding company under amendments to this Act.\nThe firm is subject to consolidated regulatory\ncapital requirements which are calculated in\naccordance with the regulations of the FRB\n(Capital Framework). The capital requirements\nare expressed as risk-based capital and\nleverage ratios that compare measures of\nregulatory capital to risk-weighted assets\n(RWAs), average assets and off-balance sheet\nexposures. Failure to comply with these\ncapital requirements would result in\nrestrictions being imposed by the firm\u2019s\nregulators and could limit the firm\u2019s ability\nto repurchase shares, pay dividends and make\ncertain discretionary compensation payments.\nThe firm\u2019s capital levels are also subject to\nqualitative judgments by the regulators about\ncomponents of capital, risk weightings and\nother factors. Furthermore, certain of the\nfirm\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to separate\nregulations and capital requirements. Capital\nFramework The regulations under the Capital\nFramework are largely based on the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision\u2019s (Basel\nCommittee) capital framework for strengthening\ninternational capital standards (Basel III)\nand also implement certain provisions of the\nU.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act. Under the Capital\nFramework, the firm is an \u201cAdvanced\napproaches\u201d banking organization and has been\ndesignated as a global systemically important\nbank (G-SIB). The Capital Framework includes\nthe minimum risk-based capital and the capital\nconservation buffer requirements. The buffer\nmust consist entirely of capital that\nqualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)\ncapital. The firm calculates its CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in\naccordance with both the Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules. Each of the ratios\ncalculated under the Standardized and Advanced\nCapital Rules must meet its respective capital\nrequirements. Under the Capital Framework, the\nfirm is also subject to leverage requirements\nwhich consist of a minimum Tier 1 leverage\nratio and a minimum supplementary leverage\nratio (SLR), as well as the SLR buffer.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    203  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\nG-SIB surcharge is\ncalculated using two\nmethodologies, the\nhigher of which is\nreflected in the\nfirm\u2019s risk-based\ncapital requirements.\nThe first calculation\n(Method 1) is based on\nthe Basel Committee\u2019s\nmethodology which,\namong other factors,\nrelies upon measures\nof the size, activity\nand complexity of each\nG-SIB. The second\ncalculation (Method 2)\nuses similar inputs\nbut includes a measure\nof reliance on short-\nterm wholesale\nfunding.\nThe table below\npresents information\nabout risk-based\ncapital ratios.\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  mil\u2026                                        \n  As                                          \n  of                                          \n  Dec\u2026                                        \n  2023              Stand\u2026            Advan\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  CET1    $  99,4\u2026          $  99,4\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  Tier                                        \n  1       $  110,\u2026          $  110,\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  Tier                                        \n  2       $  14,8\u2026          $  10,6\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026    $  125,\u2026          $  120,\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  RWAs    $  692,\u2026          $  665,\u2026          \n  CET1                                        \n  cap\u2026        14.4  %           14.9  %       \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  Tier                                        \n  1           15.9  %           16.6  %       \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026                                        \n  cap\u2026        18.1  %           18.2  %       \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  As                                          \n  of                                          \n  Dec\u2026                                        \n  2022                                        \n  CET1    $  98,0\u2026          $  98,0\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  Tier                                        \n  1       $  108,\u2026          $  108,\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  Tier                                        \n  2       $  15,9\u2026          $  12,1\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026    $  124,\u2026          $  120,\u2026          \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  RWAs    $  653,\u2026          $  679,\u2026          \n  CET1                                        \n  cap\u2026        15.0  %           14.4  %       \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  Tier                                        \n  1           16.6  %           16.0  %       \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026                                        \n  cap\u2026        19.1  %           17.8  %       \n  rat\u2026                                        \n                                              \nLeverage Ratios.

RWAs are calculated in accordance with\nboth the Standardized and Advanced Capital\nRules. Credit Risk Credit RWAs are calculated\nbased on measures of exposure, which are then\nrisk weighted under the Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules: \u2022 The Standardized\nCapital Rules apply prescribed risk-weights,\nwhich depend largely on the type of\ncounterparty. The exposure measures for\nderivatives and securities financing\ntransactions are based on specific formulas\nwhich take certain factors into consideration.\n\u2022 Under the Advanced Capital Rules, the firm\ncomputes risk-weights for wholesale and retail\ncredit exposures in accordance with the\nAdvanced Internal Ratings-Based approach. The\nexposure measures for derivatives and\nsecurities financing transactions are computed\nutilizing internal models. \u2022 For both\nStandardized and Advanced credit RWAs, the\nrisk-weights for securitizations and equities\nare based on specific required formulaic\napproaches. Market Risk RWAs for market risk\nin accordance with the Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules are generally\nconsistent. Market RWAs are calculated based\non measures of exposure which include the\nfollowing: \u2022 Value-at-Risk (VaR) is the\npotential loss in value of trading assets and\nliabilities, as well as certain investments,\nloans, and other financial assets and\nliabilities accounted for at fair value, due\nto adverse market movements over a defined\ntime horizon with a specified confidence\nlevel. For both risk management purposes and\nregulatory capital calculations, the firm uses\na single VaR model which captures risks,\nincluding those related to interest rates,\nequity prices, currency rates and commodity\nprices. However, VaR used for risk management\npurposes differs from VaR used for regulatory\ncapital requirements (regulatory VaR) due to\ndifferences in time horizons, confidence\nlevels and the scope of positions on which VaR\nis calculated. For risk management purposes, a\n95% one-dayVaR is used, whereas for regulatory\ncapital requirements, a 99% 10-dayVaR is used\nto determine Market RWAs and a 99% one-dayVaR\nis used to determine regulatory VaR\nexceptions. In addition, the daily net\nrevenues used to determine risk management VaR\nexceptions (i.e., comparing the daily net\nrevenues to the VaR measure calculated as of\nthe end of the prior business day) include\nintraday activity, whereas the Capital\nFramework requires that intraday activity be\nexcluded from daily net revenues when\ncalculating regulatory VaR exceptions.\nIntraday activity includes bid/offer net\nrevenues, which are more likely than not to be\npositive by their nature. As a result, there\nmay be differences in the number of VaR\nexceptions and the amount of daily net\nrevenues calculated for regulatory VaR\ncompared to the amounts calculated for risk\nmanagement VaR. The firm\u2019s positional losses\nobserved on a single day exceeded its 99% one-\ndayregulatory VaR on one occasion during both\n2023 and 2022. There was no change in the\nfirm\u2019s VaR multiplier used to calculate Market\nRWAs; \u2022 Stressed VaR is the potential loss in\nvalue of trading assets and liabilities, as\nwell as certain investments, loans, and other\nfinancial assets and liabilities accounted for\nat fair value, during a period of significant\nmarket stress; \u2022 Incremental risk is the\npotential loss in value of non-securitized\npositions due to the default or credit\nmigration of issuers of financial instruments\nover a one-year time horizon; \u2022 Comprehensive\nrisk is the potential loss in value, due to\nprice risk and defaults, within the firm\u2019s\ncredit correlation positions; and \u2022 Specific\nrisk is the risk of loss on a position that\ncould result from factors other than broad\nmarket movements, including event risk,\ndefault risk and idiosyncratic risk. The\nstandardized measurement method is used to\ndetermine specific risk RWAs, by applying\nsupervisory defined risk-weighting factors\nafter applicable netting is performed.\n                                       \n  206    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

GS Bank USA is a New\nYork State-chartered bank and a member of the\nFederal Reserve System, is supervised and\nregulated by the FRB, the FDIC, the New York\nState Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)\nand the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\n(CFPB), and is subject to regulatory capital\nrequirements that are calculated under the\nCapital Framework. GS Bank USA is an Advanced\napproaches banking organization under the\nCapital Framework. The deposits of GS Bank USA\nare insured by the FDIC to the extent provided\nby law. The Capital Framework includes the\nminimum risk-based capital and the capital\nconservation buffer requirements (consisting\nof a 2.5% buffer and the countercyclical\ncapital buffer). The buffer must consist\nentirely of capital that qualifies as CET1\ncapital. In addition, the Capital Framework\nincludes the leverage ratio requirement. GS\nBank USA is required to calculate the CET1\ncapital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital\nratios in accordance with both the\nStandardized and Advanced Capital Rules. The\nlower of each risk-based capital ratio under\nthe Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules is\nthe ratio against which GS Bank USA\u2019s\ncompliance with its risk-based capital\nrequirements is assessed. In addition, under\nthe regulatory framework for prompt corrective\naction applicable to GS Bank USA, in order to\nmeet the quantitative requirements for a\n\u201cwell-capitalized\u201d depository institution, GS\nBank USA must also meet the \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d\nrequirements in the table below.

If not utilized, the U.S. federal,\nthe state and local, and foreign net operating\nloss carryforwards will begin to expire in\n2024. If these carryforwards expire, they will\nnot have a material impact on the firm\u2019s\nresults of operations. As of December 2023,\nthe firm has recorded deferred tax assets of $\n172million in connection with foreign tax\ncredit carryforwards and a related valuation\nallowance of $ 172million. As of December\n2023, the firm has recorded deferred tax\nassets of $ 46million in connection with\ngeneral business credit carryforwards and $\n18million in connection with state and local\ntax credit carryforwards. If not utilized, the\nforeign tax credit carryforward will begin to\nexpire in 2033, the general business credit\ncarryforward will begin to expire in 2024 and\nthe state and local tax credit carryforward\nwill begin to expire in 2026. As of both\nDecember 2023 and December 2022, the firm had\nno U.S. capital loss carryforwards and no\nrelated net deferred income tax assets. As of\nDecember 2023, the firm had deferred tax\nassets of $ 328million in connection with\nforeign capital loss carryforwards and a\nvaluation allowance of $ 308million related to\nthese capital loss carryforwards. The\nvaluation allowance increased by $ 409million\nduring 2023 and $ 674million during 2022. The\nincreases in both 2023 and 2022 were primarily\ndue to an increase in deferred tax assets from\nwhich the firm does not expect to realize any\nbenefit. The firm permanently reinvested\neligible earnings of certain foreign\nsubsidiaries.

Business\nSegments The firm\nmanages and reports\nits activities in\nthreebusiness\nsegments: Global\nBanking & Markets,\nAsset & Wealth\nManagement and\nPlatform Solutions.\nSee Note 1 for\ninformation about the\nfirm\u2019s business\nsegments. Compensation\nand benefits expenses\nin the firm\u2019s segments\nreflect, among other\nfactors, the overall\nperformance of the\nfirm, as well as the\nperformance of\nindividual businesses.\nConsequently, pre-tax\nmargins in one segment\nof the firm\u2019s business\nmay be significantly\naffected by the\nperformance of the\nfirm\u2019s other business\nsegments. The firm\nallocates assets\n(including allocations\nof global core liquid\nassets and cash,\nsecured client\nfinancing and other\nassets), revenues and\nexpenses among the\nthreebusiness\nsegments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of\nthese segments,\nestimates and\njudgments are made in\nallocating certain\nassets, revenues and\nexpenses. The\nallocation process is\nbased on the manner in\nwhich management\ncurrently views the\nperformance of the\nsegments. The\nallocation of common\nshareholders\u2019 equity\nand preferred stock\ndividends to each\nsegment is based on\nthe estimated amount\nof equity required to\nsupport the activities\nof the segment under\nrelevant regulatory\ncapital requirements.\nNet earnings for each\nsegment is calculated\nby applying the\nfirmwide tax rate to\neach segment\u2019s pre-tax\nearnings. Management\nbelieves that this\nallocation provides a\nreasonable\nrepresentation of each\nsegment\u2019s contribution\nto consolidated net\nearnings to common,\nreturn on average\ncommon equity and\ntotal assets.\nTransactions between\nsegments are based on\nspecific criteria or\napproximate third-\nparty rates.\n\nSegment Results\nThe table below presents a summary of the\nfirm\u2019s

As o f the\ndate hereof, the firm has estimated the upper\nend of the range of reasonably possible\naggregate loss fo r such matters and for any\nother matters described below where management\nhas been able to estimate a range of\nreasonably possible aggregate loss to be\napproximately $ 2.1billion in excess of the\naggregate reserves for such matters.\nManagement is generally unable to estimate a\nrange of reasonably possible loss for matters\nother than those included in the estimate\nabove, including where (i) actual or potential\nplaintiffs have not claimed an amount of money\ndamages, except in those instances where\nmanagement can otherwise determine an\nappropriate amount, (ii) matters are in early\nstages, (iii) matters relate to regulatory\ninvestigations or reviews, except in those\ninstances where management can otherwise\ndetermine an appropriate amount, (iv) there is\nuncertainty as to the likelihood of a class\nbeing certified or the ultimate size of the\nclass, (v) there is uncertainty as to the\noutcome of pending appeals or motions, (vi)\nthere are significant factual issues to be\nresolved, and/or (vii) there are novel legal\nissues presented. For example, the firm\u2019s\npotential liabilities with respect to the\ninvestigations and reviews described below in\n\u201cRegulatory Investigations and Reviews and\nRelated Litigation\u201d generally are not included\nin management\u2019s estimate of reasonably\npossible loss. However, management does not\nbelieve, based on currently available\ninformation, that the outcomes of such other\nmatters will have a material adverse effect on\nthe firm\u2019s financial condition, though the\noutcomes could be material to the firm\u2019s\noperating results for any particular period,\ndepending, in part, upon the operating results\nfor such period. 1MDB-Related Matters Between\n2012 and 2013, subsidiaries of the firm acted\nas arrangers or purchasers of approximately $\n6.5billion of debt securities of 1MDB. On\nNovember 1, 2018, the U.S. Department of\nJustice (DOJ) unsealed a criminal information\nand guilty plea by Tim Leissner, a former\nparticipating managing director of the firm,\nand an indictment against Ng Chong Hwa, a\nformer managing director of the firm. On\nAugust 28, 2018, Leissner was adjudicated\nguilty by the U.S. District Court for the\nEastern District of New York of conspiring to\nlaunder money and to violate the U.S. Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act\u2019s (FCPA) anti-bribery\nand internal accounting controls provisions.\nNg was charged with conspiring to launder\nmoney and to violate the FCPA\u2019s anti-bribery\nand internal accounting controls provisions,\nand on April 8, 2022, Ng was found guilty on\nall counts following a trial. On August 18,\n2020, the firm announced that it entered into\na settlement agreement with the Government of\nMalaysia to resolve the criminal and\nregulatory proceedings in Malaysia involving\nthe firm, which includes a guarantee that the\nGovernment of Malaysia receives at least $\n1.4billion in assets and proceeds from assets\nseized by governmental authorities around the\nworld related to 1MDB. See Note 18 for further\ninformation about this guarantee, including\nrelated arbitration proceedings. On October\n22, 2020, the firm announced that it reached\nsettlements of governmental and regulatory\ninvestigations relating to 1MDB with the DOJ,\nthe SEC, the FRB, the NYDFS, the Financial\nConduct Authority, the Prudential Regulation\nAuthority, the Singapore Attorney General\u2019s\nChambers, the Singapore Commercial Affairs\nDepartment, the Monetary Authority of\nSingapore and the Hong Kong Securities and\nFutures Commission. Group Inc. entered into a\nthree-year deferred prosecution agreement with\nthe DOJ, in which a charge against the firm,\none count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA,\nwas filed and will be dismissed within six\nmonths after the October 22, 2023 expiration\nof the agreement if the firm has abided by the\nterms of the agreement. In addition, GS\nMalaysia pleaded guilty to one count of\nconspiracy to violate the FCPA, and was\nsentenced on June 9, 2021.

The consolidated amended\ncomplaint filed on July 25, 2011, which named\nas defendants Group Inc. and certain current\nand former officers and employees of Group\nInc. and its affiliates, generally alleges\nviolations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the\nExchange Act and seeks monetary damages. The\ndefendants have moved for summary judgment. On\nApril 7, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for\nthe Second Circuit affirmed the district\ncourt\u2019s August 14, 2018 grant of class\ncertification. On June 21, 2021, the United\nStates Supreme Court vacated the judgment of\nthe Second Circuit and remanded the case for\nfurther proceedings, and on August 26, 2021,\nthe Second Circuit vacated the district\ncourt\u2019s grant of class certification and\nremanded the case for further proceedings. On\nDecember 8, 2021, the district court granted\nthe plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class\ncertification. On March 9, 2022, the Second\nCircuit granted defendants\u2019 petition seeking\ninterlocutory review of the district court\u2019s\ngrant of class certification and on August 10,\n2023, reversed the district court\u2019s class\ncertification order and remanded with\ninstructions to decertify the class. On\nNovember 16, 2023, the parties voluntarily\ndismissed the action with prejudice.\nComplaints were filed in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York on\nJuly 25, 2019 and May 29, 2020 against Goldman\nSachs Mortgage Company and GS Mortgage\nSecurities Corp. by U.S. Bank National\nAssociation, as trustee for two residential\nmortgage-backed securitization trusts that\nissued $ 1.7billion of securities. The\ncomplaints generally allege that mortgage\nloans in the trusts failed to conform to\napplicable representations and warranties and\nseek specific performance or, alternatively,\ncompensatory damages and other relief. On\nNovember 23, 2020, the court granted in part\nand denied in part defendants\u2019 motion to\ndismiss the complaint in the first action and\ndenied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint in the second action.

(Oak\nFinance), a special purpose vehicle formed in\nconnection with the Facility, and Banco\nEspirito Santo S.A. (BES) prior to the failure\nof BES. In response, GSI and, with respect to\nthe BoP\u2019s December 2015 decision, GSIB\ncommenced actions beginning in February 2015\nagainst Novo Banco S.A. (Novo Banco) in the\nEnglish Commercial Court and the BoP in\nPortuguese Administrative Court. In July 2018,\nthe English Supreme Court found that the\nEnglish courts will not have jurisdiction over\nGSI\u2019s action unless and until the Portuguese\nAdministrative Court finds against BoP in\nGSI\u2019s parallel action. In July 2018, the\nLiquidation Committee for BES issued a\ndecision seeking to claw back from GSI $\n54million paid to GSI and $ 50million\nallegedly paid to Oak Finance in connection\nwith the Facility, alleging that GSI acted in\nbad faith in extending the Facility, including\nbecause GSI allegedly knew that BES was at\nrisk of imminent failure. In October 2018, GSI\ncommenced an action in Lisbon Commercial Court\nchallenging the Liquidation Committee\u2019s\ndecision and has since also issued a claim\nagainst the Portuguese State seeking\ncompensation for losses of approximately $\n222million related to the failure of BES,\ntogether with a contingent claim for the $\n104million sought by the Liquidation\nCommittee. On April 11, 2023, GSI commenced\nadministrative proceedings against the BoP,\nseeking the nullification of the BoP\u2019s\nSeptember 2015 and December 2015 decisions on\nnew grounds.

The firm\nalso provides certain\nbenefits to former or\ninactive employees\nprior to retirement.\nDefined Benefit\nPension Plans and\nPostretirement Plans\nEmployees of certain\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries\nparticipate in various\ndefined benefit\npension plans. These\nplans generally\nprovide benefits based\non years of credited\nservice and a\npercentage of eligible\ncompensation. The firm\nmaintains a defined\nbenefit pension plan\nfor certain U.K.\nemployees. As of April\n2008, the U.K. defined\nbenefit plan was\nclosed to new\nparticipants and\nfrozen for existing\nparticipants as of\nMarch 31, 2016. The\nnon-U.S. plans do not\nhave a material impact\non the firm\u2019s\nconsolidated results\nof operations. The\nfirm also maintains a\ndefined benefit\npension plan for\nsubstantially all U.S.\nemployees hired prior\nto November 1, 2003.\nAs of November 2004,\nthis plan was closed\nto new participants\nand frozen for\nexisting participants.\nIn addition, the firm\nmaintains unfunded\npostretirement benefit\nplans that provide\nmedical and life\ninsurance for eligible\nretirees and their\ndependents covered\nunder these programs.\nThese plans do not\nhave a material impact\non the firm\u2019s\nconsolidated results\nof operations. The\nfirm recognizes the\nfunded status of its\ndefined benefit\npension and\npostretirement plans,\nmeasured as the\ndifference between the\nfair value of the plan\nassets and the benefit\nobligation, in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets.As of December\n2023, other assets\nincluded $ 93million\n(related to overfunded\npension plans) and\nother liabilities\nincluded $ 449million\nrelated to these\nplans. As of December\n2022, other assets\nincluded $ 111million\n(related to overfunded\npension plans) and\nother liabilities\nincluded $ 337million\nrelated to these\nplans. Defined\nContribution Plans The\nfirm contributes to\nemployer-sponsored\nU.S. and non-U.S.\ndefined contribution\nplans. The firm\u2019s\ncontribution to these\nplans was $ 377million\nfor 2023, $ 378million\nfor 2022 and $\n274million for 2021.\n                                       \n  230    Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Share-\nbased awards that do not require future\nservice (i.e., vested awards, including awards\ngranted to retirement-eligible employees) are\nexpensed immediately. Share-based awards that\nrequire future service are amortized over the\nrelevant service period. Forfeitures are\nrecorded when they occur. Cash dividend\nequivalents paid on RSUs are generally charged\nto retained earnings. If RSUs that require\nfuture service are forfeited, the related\ndividend equivalents originally charged to\nretained earnings are reclassified to\ncompensation expense in the period in which\nforfeiture occurs. The firm generally issues\nnew shares of common stock upon delivery of\nshare-based awards. In limited cases, as\noutlined in the applicable award agreements,\nthe firm may cash settle share-based\ncompensation awards accounted for as equity\ninstruments. For these awards, additional\npaid-in capital is adjusted to the extent of\nthe difference between the value of the award\nat the time of cash settlement and the grant-\ndate value of the award. The tax effect\nrelated to the settlement of share-based\nawards and payments of dividend equivalents is\nrecorded in income tax benefit or expense.\nStock Incentive Plan The firm sponsors a stock\nincentive plan, The Goldman Sachs Amended and\nRestated Stock Incentive Plan (2021) (2021\nSIP), which provides for grants of RSUs,\nrestricted stock, dividend equivalent rights,\nincentive stock options, nonqualified stock\noptions, stock appreciation rights, and other\nshare-based awards, each of which may be\nsubject to terms and conditions, including\nperformance or market conditions. On April 29,\n2021, shareholders approved the 2021 SIP. The\n2021 SIP is a successor to several predecessor\nstock incentive plans, the first of which was\nadopted on April 30, 1999, and each of which\nwas approved by the firm\u2019s shareholders.\n\nAs of December 2023, 58.4million shares were\navailable to be delivered pursuant to awards\ngranted under the 2021 SIP. If any shares of\ncommon stock underlying awards granted under\nthe 2021 SIP or awards granted under\npredecessor stock incentive plans are not\ndelivered because such awards are forfeited,\nterminated or canceled, or if shares of common\nstock underlying such awards are surrendered\nor withheld to satisfy any obligation of the\ngrantee (including taxes), those shares will\nbecome available to be delivered pursuant to\nawards granted under the 2021 SIP. Shares\navailable to be delivered under the 2021 SIP\nalso are subject to adjustment for certain\nevents or changes in corporate structure as\nprovided under the 2021 SIP. The 2021 SIP is\nscheduled to terminate on the date of the\nannual meeting of shareholders that occurs in\n2025. Restricted Stock Units The firm grants\nRSUs (including RSUs subject to performance or\nmarket conditions) to employees, which are\ngenerally valued based on the closing price of\nthe underlying shares on the date of grant,\nafter taking into account a liquidity discount\nfor any applicable post-vesting and delivery\ntransfer restrictions. The value of equity\nawards also considers the impact of material\nnon-public information, if any, that the firm\nexpects to make available shortly following\ngrant. RSUs not subject to performance or\nmarket conditions generally vest and\nunderlying shares of common stock are\ndelivered (net of required withholding tax)\nover a three-year period as outlined in the\napplicable award agreements. Award agreements\ngenerally provide that vesting is accelerated\nin certain circumstances, such as on\nretirement, death, disability and, in certain\ncases, conflicted employment. Delivery of the\nunderlying shares of common stock is\nconditioned on the grantees satisfying certain\nvesting and other requirements outlined in the\naward agreements. RSUs that are subject to\nperformance or market conditions generally are\nsettled after the end of a three- to five-\nyearperiod. For awards that are subject to\nperformance or market conditions, generally\nthe final award is adjusted from zeroup to\n150% of the original grant based on the extent\nto which those conditions are satisfied.\nDividend equivalents that accrue on these\nawards are paid when the awards settle.\n                                       \n  Goldman Sachs 2023 Form 10-K    231  \n                                       \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.
