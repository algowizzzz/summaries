These carry     \npoints were allocated in StoneBridge 2024     \nAccess Fund, L.P., a multi-asset access fund  \nwith a carried interest pool that includes    \nseven Goldman Sachs Asset Management          \nalternatives funds launched in 2024 across    \nmultiple investing strategies, including      \nbuyout and private equity, among others.      \nAdoption of the Carried Interest Program In   \nthe third-party alternatives business, Goldman\nSachs generally receives incentive fees (such \nas carried interest) based on a percentage of \na fund\u2019s return, or when the return exceeds a \nspecified benchmark or other performance      \ntarget after investors receive specified      \nreturns. Similar to how other companies in the\nalternative asset management industry         \ncompensate their employees, a portion of      \ncompensation for our employees who support    \nthis business is in the form of carried       \ninterest to directly tie their incentives to  \nthe performance of the funds they manage. The \nCarried Interest Program expands upon this    \nlong-standing and well-established construct  \nas a new element of our annual executive      \ncompensation structure to directly tie a      \nportion of annual compensation for our most   \nsenior leaders to a key growth strategy \u2013     \ngrowing the third-party alternatives business \nas part of our broader strategy to drive scale\nin our funds and further grow more durable,   \nfee-basedrevenues \u2013 in a manner that is       \naligned to long-term shareholder interests.   \nThe Carried Interest Program is designed to   \nenhance the firm\u2019s ability to attract and     \nretaintalent. The Compensation Committee and  \nthe Board considered the unique competitive   \nthreatsfor talent that Goldman Sachs faces,   \nincluding from alternative management firms   \nand others beyond the traditional banking     \nsector. It is critical for Goldman Sachs to   \nremain competitive by ensuring that longer-   \nterm opportunities remain aspirational for our\nsenior talent in the context of an            \nincreasingly diverse competitive landscape. As\na top 5 alternative asset manager, 1Goldman   \nSachs is especially well positionedamong its  \nbanking peers to be able to provide senior    \nleaders with the opportunity to earn carried  \ninterest under the Carried Interest Program,  \nwhich spans multiple private investing        \nstrategies.
