Business      \nContinuity and Information Security Business  \ncontinuity and information security, including\ncyber security, are high priorities for us.   \nTheir importance has been highlighted by (i)  \nthe coronavirus (COVID-19)pandemic and the    \nwork-from-home arrangements implemented by    \ncompanies worldwide in response, including us,\n(ii) numerous highly publicized events in     \nrecent years, including cyber attacks against \nfinancial institutions, governmental agencies,\nlarge consumer-based companies and other      \norganizations that resulted in the            \nunauthorized disclosure of personal           \ninformation and other sensitive or            \nconfidential information, the theft and       \ndestruction of corporate information and      \nrequests for ransom payments, and (iii)       \nextreme weather events. Our Business          \nContinuity & Technology Resilience Program has\nbeen developed to provide reasonable assurance\nof business continuity in the event of        \ndisruptions at our critical facilities or of  \nour systems, and to comply with regulatory    \nrequirements, including those of FINRA.       \nBecause we are a BHC, our Business Continuity \n& Technology Resilience Program is also       \nsubject to review by the FRB. The key elements\nof the program are crisis management, business\ncontinuity, technology resilience, business   \nrecovery, assurance and verification, and     \nprocess improvement. In the area of           \ninformation security, we have developed and   \nimplemented a framework of principles,        \npolicies and technology designed to protect   \nthe information provided to us by our clients \nand our own information from cyber attacks and\nother misappropriation, corruption or loss.   \nSafeguards are designed to maintain the       \nconfidentiality, integrity and availability of\ninformation.

Human Capital   \nManagement Our people are our greatest asset. \nWe believe that a major strength and principal\nreason for our success is the quality,        \ndedication, determination and collaboration of\nour people, which enables us to serve our     \nclients, generate long-term value for our     \nshareholders and contribute to the broader    \ncommunity. We invest heavily in developing and\nsupporting our people throughout their        \ncareers, and we strive to maintain a work     \nenvironment that fosters professionalism,     \nexcellence, high standards of business ethics,\ndiversity, teamwork and cooperation among our \nemployees worldwide. Diversity and Inclusion  \nThe strength of our culture, our ability to   \nexecute our strategy, and our relationships   \nwith clients all depend on a diverse workforce\nand an inclusive work environment that        \nencourages a wide range of perspectives. We   \nbelieve that employee diversity at all levels \nof our businesses, from entry-level analysts  \nto senior management, is essential to our     \nsustainability. Our management team works     \nclosely with our Global Inclusion and         \nDiversity Committee to continue to increase   \ndiversity of our global workforce at all      \nlevels. In addition, we also have regional    \nInclusion and Diversity Committees which      \npromote an environment that values different  \nperspectives, challenges conventional thinking\nand maximizes the potential of all our people.\nWe believe that increased diversity, including\ndiversity of experience, gender identity,     \nrace, ethnicity, sexual orientation,          \ndisability and veteran status, in addition to \nbeing a social imperative, is vital to our    \ncommercial success through the creativity that\nit fosters. For this reason, we have          \nestablished a comprehensive action plan with  \naspirational diversity hiring goals which are \nset forth below and are focused on cultivating\nan inclusive environment for all our          \ncolleagues.

Global Reach  \nand Strategic Locations As a firm with a      \nglobal client base, we take a strategic       \napproach to attracting, developing and        \nmanaging a global workforce. Our clients are  \nlocated worldwide and we are an active        \nparticipant in financial markets around the   \nworld. As of December 2020, we had headcount  \nof 40,500, offices in over 35 countries and   \n53% of our headcount was based in the         \nAmericas, 19% in EMEA and 28% in Asia. Our    \nemployees come from over 160 countries and    \nspeak more than 110 languages as of December  \n2020. In addition to maintaining offices in   \nmajor financial centers around the world, we  \nhave established key strategic locations,     \nincluding in Bengaluru, Salt Lake City,       \nDallas, Singapore and Warsaw. We continue to  \nevaluate the expanded use of strategic        \nlocations, including cities in which we do not\ncurrently have a presence. As of December     \n2020, 36% of our employees were working in one\nof these key strategic locations, and our goal\nis to increase this percentage to             \napproximately 40% by the end of 2022. We      \nbelieve our investment in these strategic     \nlocations enables us to build centers of      \nexcellence around specific capabilities that  \nsupport our business initiatives. Competition \nThe financial services industry and all of our\nbusinesses are intensely competitive, and we  \nexpect them to remain so. Our competitors are \nother entities that provide investment banking\n(including transaction banking), market-      \nmaking, investment management services,       \ncommercial and/or consumer lending, deposit-  \ntaking and other banking products and         \nservices, as well as those entities that make \ninvestments in securities, commodities,       \nderivatives, real estate, loans and other     \nfinancial assets. These entities include      \nbrokers and dealers, investment banking firms,\ncommercial banks, credit card issuers,        \ninsurance companies, investment advisers,     \nmutual funds, hedge funds, private equity     \nfunds, merchant banks, consumer finance       \ncompanies and financial technology and other  \ninternet-based companies. We compete with some\nentities globally and with others on a        \nregional, product or niche basis. We compete  \nbased on a number of factors, including       \ntransaction execution, client experience,     \nproducts and services, innovation, reputation \nand price. We have faced, and expect to       \ncontinue to face, pressure to retain market   \nshare by committing capital to businesses or  \ntransactions on terms that offer returns that \nmay not be commensurate with their risks. In  \nparticular, corporate clients seek such       \ncommitments (such as agreements to participate\nin their loan facilities) from financial      \nservices firms in connection with investment  \nbanking and other assignments. Consolidation  \nand convergence have significantly increased  \nthe capital base and geographic reach of some \nof our competitors, and have also hastened the\nglobalization of the securities and other     \nfinancial services markets. As a result, we   \nhave had to commit capital to support our     \ninternational operations and to execute large \nglobal transactions. To capitalize on some of \nour most significant opportunities, we will   \nhave to compete successfully with financial   \ninstitutions that are larger and have more    \ncapital and that may have a stronger local    \npresence and longer operating history outside \nthe U.S. We also compete with smaller         \ninstitutions that offer more targeted         \nservices, such as independent advisory firms. \nSome clients may perceive these firms to be   \nless susceptible to potential conflicts of    \ninterest than we are, and, as described below,\nour ability to effectively compete with them  \ncould be affected by regulations and          \nlimitations on activities that apply to us but\nmay not apply to them. A number of our        \nbusinesses are subject to intense price       \ncompetition. Efforts by our competitors to    \ngain market share have resulted in pricing    \npressure in our investment banking, market-   \nmaking, lending and asset management          \nbusinesses. For example, the increasing volume\nof trades executed electronically, through the\ninternet and through alternative trading      \nsystems, has increased the pressure on trading\ncommissions, in that commissions for          \nelectronic trading are generally lower than   \nthose for non-electronictrading. It appears   \nthat this trend toward low-commissiontrading  \nwill continue. Price competition has also led \nto compression in the difference between the  \nprice at which a market participant is willing\nto sell an instrument and the price at which  \nanother market participant is willing to buy  \nit (i.e., bid/offer spread), which has        \naffected our market-making businesses. The    \nincreasing prevalence of passive investment   \nstrategies that typically have lower fees than\nother strategies we offer has affected the    \ncompetitive and pricing dynamics for our asset\nmanagement products and services. In addition,\nwe believe that we will continue to experience\ncompetitive pressures in these and other areas\nin the future as some of our competitors seek \nto obtain market share by further reducing    \nprices, and as we enter into or expand our    \npresence in markets that may rely more heavily\non electronic trading and execution.          \n                                     \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    7  \n                                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe also compete on the basis of the types of  \nfinancial products and client experiences that\nwe and our competitors offer. In some         \ncircumstances, our competitors may offer      \nfinancial products that we do not offer and   \nthat our clients may prefer, or our           \ncompetitors may develop technology platforms  \nthat provide a better client experience. The  \nprovisions of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank\nAct), the requirements promulgated by the     \nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel \nCommittee) and other financial regulations    \ncould affect our competitive position to the  \nextent that limitations on activities,        \nincreased fees and compliance costs or other  \nregulatory requirements do not apply, or do   \nnot apply equally, to all of our competitors  \nor are not implemented uniformly across       \ndifferent jurisdictions. For example, the     \nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit\nproprietary trading and restrict investments  \nin certain hedge and private equity funds     \ndifferentiate between U.S.-based and          \nnon-U.S.-basedbanking organizations and give  \nnon-U.S.-basedbanking organizations greater   \nflexibility to trade outside of the U.S. and  \nto form and invest in funds outside the U.S.  \nLikewise, the obligations with respect to     \nderivative transactions under Title VII of the\nDodd-Frank Act depend, in part, on the        \nlocation of the counterparties to the         \ntransaction. The impact of regulatory         \ndevelopments on our competitive position has  \ndepended and will continue to depend to a     \nlarge extent on the manner in which the       \nrequired rulemaking and regulatory guidance   \nevolve, the extent of international           \nconvergence, and the development of market    \npractice and structures under the evolving    \nregulatory regimes, as described further in   \n\u201cRegulation\u201d below. We also face intense      \ncompetition in attracting and retaining       \nqualified employees. Our ability to continue  \nto compete effectively has depended and will  \ncontinue to depend upon our ability to attract\nnew employees, retain and motivate our        \nexisting employees and to continue to         \ncompensate employees competitively amid       \nintense public and regulatory scrutiny on the \ncompensation practices of large financial     \ninstitutions. Our pay practices and those of  \ncertain of our competitors are subject to     \nreview by, and the standards of, the FRB and  \nother regulators inside and outside the U.S., \nincluding the Prudential Regulation Authority \n(PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority     \n(FCA) in the U.K. We also compete for         \nemployees with institutions whose pay         \npractices are not subject to regulatory       \noversight. See \u201cRegulation \u2014 Compensation     \nPractices\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors \u2014 Competition \u2014  \nOur businesses may be adversely affected if we\nare unable to hire and retain qualified       \nemployees\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form    \n10-Kfor further information about such        \nregulation. Regulation As a participant in the\nglobal financial services industry, we are    \nsubject to extensive regulation and           \nsupervision worldwide. The regulatory regimes \napplicable to our operations worldwide have   \nrecently been, and continue to be, subject to \nsignificant changes. The Basel Committee is   \nthe primary global standard setter for        \nprudential bank regulation; however, its      \nstandards do not become effective in a        \njurisdiction until the relevant regulators    \nhave adopted rules to implement its standards.\nThe implications of these regulations for our \nbusinesses depend to a large extent on their  \nimplementation by the relevant regulators     \nglobally, and the market practices and        \nstructures that develop. New regulations have \nbeen adopted or are being considered by       \nregulators and policy makers worldwide, as    \ndescribed below. The effects of any changes to\nthe regulations affecting our businesses,     \nincluding as a result of the proposals        \ndescribed below, are uncertain and will not be\nknown until such changes are finalized and    \nmarket practices and structures develop under \nthe revised regulations. Our principal        \nsubsidiaries operating in Europe include      \nGoldman Sachs International (GSI), GSIB and   \nGoldman Sachs Asset Management International  \n(GSAMI), which are incorporated and           \nheadquartered in the U.K., and Goldman Sachs  \nBank Europe SE (GSBE), which is incorporated  \nand headquartered in Germany. As a result of  \nthe U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U. (Brexit), \nthe regulatory framework that governs         \ntransactions and business undertaken by our   \nU.K. subsidiaries has changed, especially in  \nconnection with transactions and business     \nrelating to the E.U.                          \n                                     \n  8    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                     \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe E.U. and the U.K. agreed to a withdrawal  \nagreement (the Withdrawal Agreement), which   \nbecame effective on January 31, 2020 when the \nU.K. ceased to be an E.U. member state. The   \ntransition period under the Withdrawal        \nAgreement ended on December 31, 2020. During  \nthe transition period, the U.K. was treated as\nif it were a member state of the E.U. and     \ntherefore our U.K. subsidiaries benefitted    \nfrom non-discriminatoryaccess to E.U. clients \nand infrastructure. Effective on December 31, \n2020, and notwithstanding the Trade and       \nCooperation Agreement between the E.U. and the\nU.K. reached at the end of 2020, firms        \nestablished in the U.K., including our U.K.   \nsubsidiaries, have lost their                 \npan-E.U.\u201cpassports\u201d and are generally treated \nas any other entities in countries outside the\nE.U., whose access to the E.U. is governed by \nE.U. and national law and depends on the      \nmaking of E.U. equivalence decisions or on    \ntheir obtaining licenses or exemptions under  \nnational regimes. The U.K. has adopted E.U.   \nfinancial services legislation that was in    \neffect at December 31, 2020. This means that  \nthe U.K. financial services regime will remain\nsubstantially the same as under E.U. financial\nservices legislation, but in the future the   \nU.K. may diverge from E.U. legislation and may\ndecide not to adopt rules that correspond to  \nE.U. legislation not already operative in the \nU.K. We have strengthened the capabilities of \nour operating subsidiaries in E.U. countries, \nparticularly GSBE, and have moved certain     \nactivities there, including moving a number of\nrelationships with clients of our Investment  \nBanking, Global Markets and Wealth Management \nbusinesses from GSI and GSIB to GSBE, and     \nclients of our Asset Management business from \nGSAMI to GSBE; establishing access for GSBE to\nexchanges, clearing houses and depositories   \nand other market infrastructure in the E.U.;  \nestablishing branches of GSBE in nine E.U.    \nmember states and in the U.K.; and            \nstrengthening the capital, personnel and other\nresources at GSBE.

GSIB also maintains a branch in    \nJohannesburg, South Africa, which is regulated\nby the Prudential Authority, the Financial    \nSurveillance Department of the South African  \nReserve Bank and the Financial Sector Conduct \nAuthority. GSBE is directly supervised by the \nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) and additionally  \nby BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank in the       \ncontext of the E.U. Single Supervisory        \nMechanism (SSM). Goldman Sachs Paris Inc. et  \nCie (GSPIC), an investment firm regulated by  \nthe French Prudential Supervision and         \nResolution Authority and Financial Markets    \nRegulator, may, among other activities,       \nconduct activities that GSBE is prevented from\nundertaking. Certain of our                   \nnon-E.U.subsidiaries also maintain cross-     \nborder licenses or exemptions as              \nnon-E.U.institutions in E.U. jurisdictions    \nwhere permitted by domestic legislation.      \nCapital and Liquidity Requirements. We and GS \nBank USA are subject to regulatory risk-based \ncapital and leverage requirements that are    \ncalculated in accordance with the regulations \nof the FRB (Capital Framework). The Capital   \nFramework is largely based on the Basel       \nCommittee\u2019s framework for strengthening the   \nregulation, supervision and risk management of\nbanks (Basel III) and also implements certain \nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the   \ntailoring rules adopted by the U.S. federal   \nbank regulatory agencies in October 2019, we  \nand GS Bank USA are subject to \u201cCategory I\u201d   \nstandards because we have been designated as a\nglobal systemically important bank            \n(G-SIB).Accordingly, under the Capital        \nFramework, we and GS Bank USA are \u201cAdvanced   \napproach\u201d banking organizations. Under the    \nFRB\u2019s capital adequacy requirements, we and GS\nBank USA must meet specific regulatory capital\nrequirements that involve quantitative        \nmeasures of assets, liabilities and certain   \noff-balancesheet items. The sufficiency of our\ncapital levels is also subject to qualitative \njudgments by regulators. We and GS Bank USA   \nare also subject to liquidity requirements    \nestablished by the U.S. federal bank          \nregulatory agencies. GSBE is subject to       \ncapital requirements prescribed in the E.U.   \nCapital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the \nE.U. Fourth Capital Requirements Directive    \n(CRD IV), which are largely based on Basel    \nIII. GSBE is subject to liquidity requirements\nestablished by E.U. authorities, which are    \nsimilar to those applicable to GS Bank USA and\nus. Following the end of the Brexit transition\nperiod, from December 31, 2020, GSI and GSIB  \nhave become subject to the U.K. capital       \nframework, which is predominantly aligned with\nthe E.U. capital framework. Amendments to the \nCRR and CRD IV (respectively, CRR II and CRD  \nV) were finalized in June 2019. CRR II, which \nincludes changes to the market risk, large    \nexposures and leverage ratio frameworks will  \nbe applicable from June 2021 in the E.U., and \nfrom January 2022 in the U.K. GSI and GSAMI   \nwill be subject to a new prudential regime for\nU.K. investment firms which is expected to be \nintroduced on January 1, 2022. Risk-Based     \nCapital Ratios. The Capital Framework provides\nfor additional capital ratio requirements for \nGroup Inc., consisting of the capital         \nconservation buffer requirements, comprised of\na 2.5% buffer (under the Advanced Capital     \nRules), a stress capital buffer (under the    \nStandardized Capital Rules), and a            \ncountercyclical buffer and the G-SIBsurcharge \n(under both Capital Rules). For GS Bank USA,  \nthe capital conservation buffer requirements  \ninclude a 2.5% buffer and the countercyclical \ncapital buffer. These additional requirements \nmust be satisfied entirely with capital that  \nqualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)      \ncapital. The SCB is based on the results of   \nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory stress      \ntests, and our planned common stock dividends.\nThe countercyclical capital buffer is designed\nto counteract systemic vulnerabilities and    \ncurrently applies only to banking             \norganizations subject to Category I, II or III\nstandards, including us. Several other        \nnational supervisors also require             \ncountercyclical capital buffers. The          \nG-SIBsurcharge and countercyclical capital    \nbuffer applicable to us could change in the   \nfuture. As a result, the minimum capital      \nratios to which we are subject are likely to  \nchange over time.                             \n                                      \n  10    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDuring 2020, the U.S. federal bank regulatory \nagencies adopted a rule that allows banking   \norganizations, including us and GS Bank USA,  \nto elect to temporarily delay the estimated   \neffects of adopting the Current Expected      \nCredit Losses (CECL) accounting standard on   \nregulatory capital until January 2022 and to  \nsubsequently phase-inthe effects through      \nJanuary 2025. The FRB has also stated that it \nwill not incorporate CECL into the calculation\nof the allowance for credit losses in         \nsupervisory stress tests through the 2021     \nstress test cycle. See Note 3 to the          \nconsolidated financial statements in Part II, \nItem 8 of this Form 10-Kfor further           \ninformation about CECL. The U.S. federal bank \nregulatory agencies adopted a rule in November\n2019 that will implement the Basel Committee\u2019s\nstandardized approach for measuring           \ncounterparty credit risk exposures in         \nconnection with derivative contracts (SA-     \nCCR).Under the rule, beginning January 1,     \n2022, but with the option to adopt starting   \nApril 1, 2020, \u201cAdvanced approach\u201d banking    \norganizations will be required to use SA-     \nCCRfor purposes of calculating their          \nstandardized risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and, \nwith some adjustments, for purposes of        \ndetermining their supplementary leverage      \nratios (SLRs) discussed below. The Basel      \nCommittee standards include guidelines for    \ncalculating incremental capital ratio         \nrequirements for banking institutions that are\nsystemically significant from a domestic but  \nnot global perspective (D-SIBs).When these    \nguidelines are implemented by national        \nregulators, they may apply, among others, to  \ncertain subsidiaries of G-SIBs.These          \nguidelines are in addition to the framework   \nfor G-SIBs,but are more principles-based. CRD \nV and CRR II provide that institutions that   \nare systemically important at the E.U. or     \nmember state level, known as other            \nsystemically important institutions           \n(O-SIIs),may be subject to additional capital \nratio requirements of up to 3% of CET1,       \naccording to their degree of systemic         \nimportance (O-SIIbuffers). The designated     \nauthority may impose an O-SIIbuffer that is   \ngreater than 3% in certain cases. CRD IV and  \nthe CRR currently provide for an additional   \nrequirement of up to 2%. O-SIIsare identified \nannually, along with their applicable buffers.\nThe PRA has identified Goldman Sachs Group UK \nLimited (GSG UK), the parent company of GSI   \nand GSIB, as an O-SII.GSG UK\u2019s O-SIIbuffer is \ncurrently set at zero percent. In January     \n2019, the Basel Committee finalized revisions \nto the framework for calculating capital      \nrequirements for market risk, which is        \nexpected to increase market risk capital      \nrequirements for most banking organizations   \nand large broker-dealers subject to bank      \ncapital requirements. The revised framework,  \namong other things, revises the standardized  \nand internal models approaches used to        \ncalculate market risk requirements and        \nclarifies the scope of positions subject to   \nmarket risk capital requirements. The Basel   \nCommittee framework contemplates that national\nregulators implement the revised framework by \nJanuary 1, 2023. CRR II, which became         \neffective in June 2019 and establishes a      \nreporting standard, will become applicable in \nthe third quarter of 2021. The U.K. has       \nadopted the reporting standard set out in CRR \nII but has not stated when it will become     \napplicable. E.U. financial institutions are to\nreport their market risk calculations under   \nthe revised framework as early as January 1,  \n2021. The U.S. federal bank regulatory        \nagencies have not yet proposed rules          \nimplementing the 2019 version of the revised  \nmarket risk framework. The Basel Committee    \npublished standards in December 2017 that it  \ndescribed as the finalization of the Basel III\npost-crisis regulatory reforms. These         \nstandards set a floor on internally modeled   \ncapital requirements at a percentage of the   \ncapital requirements under the standardized   \napproach. They also revise the Basel          \nCommittee\u2019s standardized and internal model-  \nbased approaches for credit risk, provide a   \nnew standardized approach for operational risk\ncapital and revise the frameworks for credit  \nvaluation adjustment (CVA) risk. The Basel    \nCommittee framework contemplates that national\nregulators implement these standards by       \nJanuary 1, 2023, and that the new floor be    \nphased in through January 1, 2028. In July    \n2020, the Basel Committee finalized further   \nrevisions to the framework for CVA risk, which\nare intended to align that framework with the \nmarket risk framework. The Basel Committee has\nalso published updated frameworks relating to \nPillar 3 disclosure requirements and the      \nregulatory capital treatment of securitization\nexposures and a revised G-SIBassessment       \nmethodology. The U.S. federal bank regulatory \nagencies have not yet proposed rules          \nimplementing these Basel Committee frameworks \nor the December 2017 standards for purposes of\nrisk-based capital ratios. See \u201cManagement\u2019s  \nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations \u2014 Equity Capital    \nManagement and Regulatory Capital\u201d in Part II,\nItem 7 of this Form 10-Kand Note 20 to the    \nconsolidated financial statements in Part II, \nItem 8 of this Form 10-Kfor information about \nour capital ratios and those of GS Bank USA   \nand GSI. As described in \u201cOther Restrictions\u201d \nbelow, in September 2016, the FRB issued a    \nproposed rule that would, among other things, \nrequire FHCs to hold additional capital in    \nconnection with covered physical commodity    \nactivities.                                   \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    11  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nLeverage Ratios. Under the Capital Framework, \nwe and GS Bank USA are subject to Tier 1      \nleverage ratios and SLRs established by the   \nFRB. In April 2018, the FRB and the OCC issued\na proposed rule which would replace the       \ncurrent 2% SLR buffer for G-SIBs,including us,\nwith a buffer equal to 50% of their           \nG-SIBsurcharge. This proposal, together with  \nthe adopted rule requiring use of SA-CCRfor   \npurposes of calculating the SLR, would        \nimplement certain of the revisions to the     \nleverage ratio framework published by the     \nBasel Committee in December 2017. The Basel   \nCommittee standards provide for the public    \ndisclosure of average daily balances for      \ncertain components of leverage ratio          \ncalculations. The U.S. federal bank regulatory\nagencies\u2019 rule implementing SA-CCRallows for  \ngreater recognition of collateral in the      \ncalculation of total leverage exposure        \nrelating to client-cleared derivative         \ncontracts. CRR II establishes a 3% minimum    \nleverage ratio requirement for certain E.U.   \nfinancial institutions, including GSBE. This  \nrequirement will be applicable beginning in   \nJune 2021. Following Brexit, GSI and GSIB will\nbecome subject to a similar PRA-              \nrequiredleverage ratio that is expected to    \nbecome effective in January 2022. See         \n\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of      \nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations \n\u2014 Equity Capital Management and Regulatory    \nCapital\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Form      \n10-Kand Note 20 to the consolidated financial \nstatements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form    \n10-Kfor information about our and GS Bank     \nUSA\u2019s Tier 1 leverage ratios and SLRs, and    \nGSI\u2019s leverage ratio. Liquidity Ratios. The   \nBasel Committee\u2019s framework for liquidity risk\nmeasurement, standards and monitoring requires\nbanking organizations to measure their        \nliquidity against two specific liquidity      \ntests: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and \nthe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). The LCR  \nrule issued by the U.S. federal bank          \nregulatory agencies and applicable to both us \nand GS Bank USA is generally consistent with  \nthe Basel Committee\u2019s framework and is        \ndesigned to ensure that a banking organization\nmaintains an adequate level of unencumbered,  \nhigh-quality liquid assets equal to or greater\nthan the expected net cash outflows under an  \nacute short-term liquidity stress scenario. We\nare required to maintain a minimum LCR of     \n100%. We disclose, on a quarterly basis, our  \naverage daily LCR. See \u201cAvailable Information\u201d\nbelow and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and        \nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations \u2014 Equity Capital Management and    \nRegulatory Capital\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this\nForm 10-Kfor information about our average    \ndaily LCR. The LCR rule issued by the European\nCommission, which was incorporated into the   \nU.K. prudential framework and is applicable to\nGSI, GSIB and GSBE, is also generally         \nconsistent with the Basel Committee\u2019s         \nframework. The NSFR is designed to promote    \nmedium- and long-term stable funding of the   \nassets and off-balancesheet activities of     \nbanking organizations over a one-yeartime     \nhorizon. The Basel Committee\u2019s NSFR framework \nrequires banking organizations to maintain a  \nminimum NSFR of 100%. In October 2020, the    \nU.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a\nfinal rule implementing the NSFR for large    \nU.S. banking organizations, including us and  \nGS Bank USA. The final rule will become       \neffective on July 1, 2021, and we will be     \nrequired to publicly disclose our NSFR levels \nsemiannually beginning in 2023. CRR II        \nimplements the NSFR for certain E.U. financial\ninstitutions, including GSBE. This requirement\nwill be applicable beginning in June 2021.    \nFollowing the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U. \non December 31, 2020, GSI and GSIB have become\nsubject to the NSFR requirement implemented in\nthe U.K., which is expected to become         \neffective in January 2022. The FRB\u2019s enhanced \nprudential standards require BHCs with $100   \nbillion or more in total consolidated assets  \nto comply with enhanced liquidity and overall \nrisk management standards, which include      \nmaintaining a level of highly liquid assets   \nbased on projected funding needs for 30 days, \nand increased involvement by boards of        \ndirectors in liquidity and overall risk       \nmanagement. Although the liquidity requirement\nunder these rules has some similarities to the\nLCR, it is a separate requirement. GSI and    \nGSIB have their own liquidity planning        \nprocess, which incorporates internally        \ndesigned stress tests developed in accordance \nwith the guidelines of the PRA\u2019s Internal     \nLiquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP).\nGSBE also has its own liquidity planning      \nprocess, which incorporates internally        \ndesigned stress tests and those required under\nGerman regulatory requirements and the ECB    \nGuide to ILAAP.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nStress Tests. As required by the FRB\u2019s        \nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review     \n(CCAR) rules, we submit an annual capital plan\nfor review by the FRB. In June 2020, all BHCs \nparticipating in CCAR 2020, including us, were\nrequired by the FRB to resubmit their capital \nplans in November 2020 in light of the ongoing\neconomic effects of the COVID-19pandemic. In  \naddition, we are required to perform company- \nrunstress tests on an annual basis. As        \ndescribed in \u201cAvailable Information\u201d below, we\npublish summaries of our stress tests results \non our website. Our annual stress test        \nsubmission is incorporated into the annual    \ncapital plans that we submit to the FRB as    \npart of the CCAR process for large BHCs, which\nis designed to ensure that capital planning   \nprocesses will permit continued operations by \nsuch institutions during times of economic and\nfinancial stress. As part of CCAR, the FRB    \nevaluates an institution\u2019s plan to make       \ncapital distributions, such as by repurchasing\nor redeeming stock or making dividend         \npayments, across a range of macroeconomic and \ncompany-specific assumptions based on the     \ninstitution\u2019s and the FRB\u2019s stress tests. In  \nMarch 2020, the FRB approved a final rule     \nreplacing the static 2.5% component of the    \ncapital conservation buffer, under the        \nStandardized approach capital rules, with the \nSCB for BHCs with $100 billion or more in     \ntotal consolidated assets. The SCB reflects   \nstressed losses in the supervisory severely   \nadverse scenario of the FRB\u2019s CCAR stress     \ntests and includes four quarters of planned   \ncommon stock dividends. The SCB is subject to \na 2.5% floor and is generally effective on    \nOctober 1 of each year and remains in effect  \nuntil October 1 of the following year, unless \nthe SCB is reset in connection with a         \nresubmission of a capital plan. Our first SCB \nrequirement of 6.6% took effect on October 1, \n2020. Depository institutions with total      \nconsolidated assets of $250 billion or more   \nthat are subsidiaries of U.S. G-SIBsare       \nrequired to submit annual company-runstress   \ntest results to the FRB. Based on growth in   \nits balance sheet, GS Bank USA will be        \nrequired to submit its annual stress test     \nresults in 2022. Depository institutions not  \nsubject to company-runstress testing          \nrequirements are still required to have their \nown capital planning process. GSI and GSIB    \nhave their own capital planning and stress    \ntesting process, which incorporates internally\ndesigned stress tests developed in accordance \nwith the guidelines of the PRA\u2019s Internal     \nCapital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).  \nGSBE also has its own capital and stress      \ntesting process, which incorporates internally\ndesigned stress tests and those required under\nGerman regulatory requirements and the ECB    \nGuide to ICAAP. Dividends and Stock           \nRepurchases. Dividend payments to our         \nshareholders and our stock repurchases are    \nsubject to the oversight of the FRB. The final\nrule implementing the SCB provides that a BHC \nmust receive prior approval for any dividend, \nstock repurchase or other capital             \ndistribution, other than a capital            \ndistribution on a newly issued capital        \ninstrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit\nits capital plan. In connection with the      \nNovember 2020 resubmission described above    \nunder \u201cStress Tests,\u201d the FRB required those  \nBHCs to suspend stock repurchases during the  \nthird and fourth quarters of 2020 and not to  \nincrease common stock dividends or pay common \nstock dividends in excess of their average net\nincome over the prior four quarters. In       \nDecember 2020, the FRB announced that it would\nrequire BHCs not to increase common stock     \ndividends and would permit common stock       \ndividends and stock repurchases that, in the  \naggregate, do not exceed a BHC\u2019s average net  \nincome over the prior four quarters, as well  \nas stock repurchases equal to the amount of   \nshare issuances related to expensed employee  \ncompensation. We suspended stock repurchases  \nduring the first quarter of 2020 and,         \nconsistent with the FRB\u2019s requirement for all \nlarge BHCs, extended the suspension of stock  \nrepurchases through the fourth quarter of     \n2020. We resumed stock repurchases in the     \nfirst quarter of 2021. U.S. federal and state \nlaws impose limitations on the payment of     \ndividends by U.S. depository institutions,    \nsuch as GS Bank USA. In general, the amount of\ndividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA is  \nlimited to the lesser of the amounts          \ncalculated under a recent earnings test and an\nundivided profits test. Under the recent      \nearnings test, a dividend may not be paid if  \nthe total of all dividends declared by the    \nentity in any calendar year is in excess of   \nthe current year\u2019s net income combined with   \nthe retained net income of the two preceding  \nyears, unless the entity obtains prior        \nregulatory approval. Under the undivided      \nprofits test, a dividend may not be paid in   \nexcess of the entity\u2019s undivided profits      \n(generally, accumulated net profits that have \nnot been paid out as dividends or transferred \nto surplus). In addition, as a result of GS   \nBank USA\u2019s election to exclude holdings of    \nU.S. Treasury securities and deposits at the  \nFederal Reserve from its total leverage       \nexposure, in calculating the supplementary    \nleverage ratio, any dividend by GS Bank USA   \nthrough March 31, 2021 is subject to the prior\napproval of the FRB. The applicable U.S.      \nbanking regulators have authority to prohibit \nor limit the payment of dividends if, in the  \nbanking regulator\u2019s opinion, payment of a     \ndividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound\npractice in light of the financial condition  \nof the banking organization.                  \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    13  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGiven the COVID-19pandemic, significant banks \nestablished in the E.U., such as GSBE, are    \ncurrently subject to an ECB recommendation not\nto distribute any cash dividends or to limit  \nsuch distributions through September 2021, and\nin any event to limit dividends to 15% of     \ntheir total profits for 2019-2020 and 20 basis\npoints of their CET1 capital ratio, whichever \nis lower. According to this recommendation,   \nbanks that intend to pay dividends or buy back\nshares need to be profitable and have robust  \ncapital. Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank   \nAct requires BHCs to act as a source of       \nstrength to their bank subsidiaries and to    \ncommit capital and financial resources to     \nsupport those subsidiaries. This support may  \nbe required by the FRB at times when BHCs     \nmight otherwise determine not to provide it.  \nCapital loans by a BHC to a subsidiary bank   \nare subordinate in right of payment to        \ndeposits and to certain other indebtedness of \nthe subsidiary bank. In addition, if a BHC    \ncommits to a U.S. federal banking agency that \nit will maintain the capital of its bank      \nsubsidiary, whether in response to the FRB\u2019s  \ninvoking its source-of-strengthauthority or in\nresponse to other regulatory measures, that   \ncommitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy  \ntrustee for the BHC and the bank will be      \nentitled to priority payment in respect of    \nthat commitment, ahead of other creditors of  \nthe BHC. Transactions between Affiliates.     \nTransactions between GS Bank USA or its       \nsubsidiaries and Group Inc. or its other      \nsubsidiaries and affiliates are subject to    \nrestrictions under the Federal Reserve Act and\nregulations issued by the FRB. These laws and \nregulations generally limit the types and     \namounts of transactions (such as loans and    \nother credit extensions, including credit     \nexposure arising from resale agreements,      \nsecurities borrowing and derivative           \ntransactions, from GS Bank USA or its         \nsubsidiaries to Group Inc. or its other       \nsubsidiaries and affiliates and purchases of  \nassets by GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries from\nGroup Inc. or its other subsidiaries and      \naffiliates) that may take place and generally \nrequire those transactions to be on market    \nterms or better to GS Bank USA or its         \nsubsidiaries. These laws and regulations      \ngenerally do not apply to transactions between\nGS Bank USA and its subsidiaries. Similarly,  \nPRA rules and German regulatory requirements  \nprovide that transactions between GSI, GSIB,  \nGSBE and their respective affiliates,         \nincluding Group Inc. and GS Bank USA, must be \non market terms and are subject to special    \ninternal approval requirements. The BHC Act   \nprohibits the FRB from requiring a payment by \na BHC subsidiary to a depository institution  \nif the functional regulator of that subsidiary\nobjects to the payment. In that case, the FRB \ncould instead require the divestiture of the  \ndepository institution and impose operating   \nrestrictions pending the divestiture.         \nResolution and Recovery. We are required by   \nthe FRB and the FDIC to submit a periodic plan\nfor our rapid and orderly resolution in the   \nevent of material financial distress or       \nfailure (resolution plan). If the regulators  \njointly determine that an institution has     \nfailed to remediate identified shortcomings in\nits resolution plan and that its resolution   \nplan, after any permitted resubmission, is not\ncredible or would not facilitate an orderly   \nresolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the\nregulators may jointly impose more stringent  \ncapital, leverage or liquidity requirements or\nrestrictions on growth, activities or         \noperations, or may jointly order the          \ninstitution to divest assets or operations, in\norder to facilitate orderly resolution in the \nevent of failure. We submitted our 2019       \nresolution plan in June 2019 and the FRB and  \nFDIC did not identify deficiencies or         \nshortcomings. In October 2019, the FRB and    \nFDIC adopted a rule requiring U.S. G-SIBsto   \nsubmit resolution plans on a two-yearcycle    \n(alternating between full and targeted        \nsubmissions). Our next required submission is \na targeted submission by July 1, 2021. See    \n\u201cRisk Factors \u2014 The application of Group      \nInc.\u2019s proposed resolution strategy could     \nresult in greater losses for Group Inc.\u2019s     \nsecurity holders\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this  \nForm 10-Kand \u201cAvailable Information\u201d in Part  \nI, Item 1 of this Form 10-Kfor further        \ninformation about our resolution plan. We are \nalso required by the FRB to submit, on a      \nperiodic basis, a global recovery plan that   \noutlines the steps that we could take to      \nreduce risk, maintain sufficient liquidity,   \nand conserve capital in times of prolonged    \nstress. The FDIC has issued a rule requiring  \neach insured depository institution (IDI) with\n$50 billion or more in assets, such as GS Bank\nUSA, to provide a resolution plan. Our        \nresolution plan for GS Bank USA must, among   \nother things, demonstrate that it is          \nadequately protected from risks arising from  \nour other entities. GS Bank USA\u2019s most recent \nresolution plan was submitted in June 2018. In\nApril 2019, the FDIC released an advanced     \nnotice of proposed rulemaking about potential \nchanges to its resolution planning            \nrequirements for IDIs, including GS Bank USA, \nand delayed the next round of IDI resolution  \nplan submissions until the rulemaking process \nis complete. Although the rulemaking process  \nis still pending, in January 2021, the FDIC   \nannounced its intention to resume requiring   \nresolution plan submissions for IDIs with $100\nbillion or more in assets, including GS Bank  \nUSA.                                          \n                                      \n  14    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have\nadopted rules imposing restrictions on        \nqualified financial contracts (QFCs) entered  \ninto by G-SIBs,which became fully effective in\nJanuary 2020. The rules are intended to       \nfacilitate the orderly resolution of a failed \nG-SIBby limiting the ability of the G-SIBto   \nenter into a QFC unless (i) the counterparty  \nwaives certain default rights in such contract\narising upon the entry of the G-SIBor one of  \nits affiliates into resolution, (ii) the      \ncontract does not contain enumerated          \nprohibitions on the transfer of such contract \nand/or any related credit enhancement, and    \n(iii) the counterparty agrees that the        \ncontract will be subject to the special       \nresolution regimes set forth in the Dodd-Frank\nAct orderly liquidation authority (OLA) and   \nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950     \n(FDIA), described below. Compliance can be    \nachieved by adhering to the International     \nSwaps and Derivatives Association Universal   \nResolution Stay Protocol (ISDA Universal      \nProtocol) or International Swaps and          \nDerivatives Association 2018 U.S. Resolution  \nStay Protocol (U.S. ISDA Protocol) described  \nbelow. Certain of our subsidiaries, along with\nthose of a number of other major global       \nbanking organizations, adhere to the ISDA     \nUniversal Protocol, which was developed and   \nupdated in coordination with the Financial    \nStability Board (FSB), an international body  \nthat sets standards and coordinates the work  \nof national financial authorities and         \ninternational standard-setting bodies. The    \nISDA Universal Protocol imposes a stay on     \ncertain cross-default and early termination   \nrights within standard ISDA derivative        \ncontracts and securities financing            \ntransactions between adhering parties in the  \nevent that one of them is subject to          \nresolution in its home jurisdiction, including\na resolution under the OLA or the FDIA in the \nU.S. In addition, certain Group Inc.          \nsubsidiaries adhere to the U.S. ISDA Protocol,\nwhich was based on the ISDA Universal Protocol\nand was created to allow market participants  \nto comply with the final QFC rules adopted by \nthe federal bank regulatory agencies. The     \namended E.U. Bank Recovery and Resolution     \nDirective (BRRD II) establishes a framework   \nfor the recovery and resolution of financial  \ninstitutions in the E.U., such as GSBE. The   \nBRRD II provides national supervisory         \nauthorities with tools and powers to pre-     \nemptivelyaddress potential financial crises in\norder to promote financial stability and      \nminimize taxpayers\u2019 exposure to losses. The   \nBRRD II requires E.U. member states to grant  \ncertain resolution powers to national and,    \nwhere relevant, E.U. resolution authorities,  \nincluding the power to impose a temporary stay\nand to recapitalize a failing entity by       \nwriting down its unsecured debt or converting \nits unsecured debt into equity. Financial     \ninstitutions in the E.U. must provide that    \ncontracts governed by non-E.U.law recognize   \nthose temporary stay and bail-inpowers unless \ndoing so would be impracticable. Regulatory   \nauthorities in the E.U. may require financial \ninstitutions in the E.U., including           \nsubsidiaries of non-E.U.groups, to submit     \nrecovery plans and to assist the relevant     \nresolution authority in constructing          \nresolution plans for the E.U. entities. The   \nU.K. Special Resolution Regime confers        \nsubstantially the same powers on the Bank of  \nEngland, as the U.K. resolution authority, and\nsubstantially the same requirements on U.K.   \nfinancial institutions. Further, certain U.K. \nfinancial institutions, including GSI and     \nGSIB, have been required by the PRA to submit \nsolvent wind-down plans on how they could be  \nwound down in a stressed environment. Total   \nLoss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). The FRB has   \nissued a rule addressing U.S. implementation  \nof the FSB\u2019s TLAC principles and term sheet on\nminimum TLAC requirements for G-SIBs.The rule \n(i) establishes minimum TLAC requirements,    \n(ii) establishes minimum \u201celigible long-term  \ndebt\u201d (i.e., debt that is unsecured, has a    \nmaturity of at least one year from issuance   \nand satisfies certain additional criteria)    \nrequirements, (iii) prohibits certain parent  \ncompany transactions and (iv) caps the amount \nof parent company liabilities that are not    \neligible long-term debt. The rule also        \nprohibits a BHC that has been designated as a \nU.S. G-SIBfrom (i) guaranteeing liabilities of\nsubsidiaries that are subject to early        \ntermination provisions if the BHC enters into \nan insolvency or receivership proceeding,     \nsubject to an exception for guarantees        \npermitted by rules of the U.S. federal banking\nagencies imposing restrictions on QFCs; (ii)  \nincurring liabilities guaranteed by           \nsubsidiaries; (iii) issuing short-term debt;  \nor (iv) entering into derivatives and certain \nother financial contracts with external       \ncounterparties. Additionally, the rule caps,  \nat 5% of the value of the parent company\u2019s    \neligible TLAC, the amount of unsecured non-   \ncontingentthird-party liabilities that are not\neligible long-term debt that could rank       \nequally with or junior to eligible long-term  \ndebt.                                         \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    15  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDeposit Insurance. Deposits at GS Bank USA    \nhave the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the  \napplicable limits. The FDIC\u2019s Deposit         \nInsurance Fund is funded by assessments on    \nIDIs. GS Bank USA\u2019s assessment (subject to    \nadjustment by the FDIC) is currently based on \nits average total consolidated assets less its\naverage tangible equity during the assessment \nperiod, its supervisory ratings and specified \nforward-looking financial measures used to    \ncalculate the assessment rate. In addition,   \ndeposits at GSIB are covered by the U.K.      \nFinancial Services Compensation Scheme and    \ndeposits at GSBE are covered by the German    \nstatutory deposit protection scheme and a     \nvoluntary top-upscheme, in each case up to the\napplicable limits. Prompt Corrective Action.  \nThe U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nImprovement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) requires the \nU.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to take \n\u201cprompt corrective action\u201d in respect of      \ndepository institutions that do not meet      \nspecified capital requirements. FDICIA        \nestablishes five capital categories for FDIC- \ninsured banks, such as GS Bank USA: well-     \ncapitalized, adequately capitalized,          \nundercapitalized, significantly               \nundercapitalized and critically               \nundercapitalized. An institution may be       \ndowngraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital  \ncategory that is lower than is indicated by   \nits capital ratios if it is determined to be  \nin an unsafe or unsound condition or if it    \nreceives an unsatisfactory examination rating \nwith respect to certain matters. FDICIA       \nimposes progressively more restrictive        \nconstraints on operations, management and     \ncapital distributions, as the capital category\nof an institution declines. Failure to meet   \nthe capital requirements could also require a \ndepository institution to raise capital.      \nUltimately, critically undercapitalized       \ninstitutions are subject to the appointment of\na receiver or conservator, as described in    \n\u201cInsolvency of an IDI or a BHC\u201d above. The    \nprompt corrective action regulations do not   \napply to BHCs. However, the FRB is authorized \nto take appropriate action at the BHC level,  \nbased upon the undercapitalized status of the \nBHC\u2019s depository institution subsidiaries. In \ncertain instances, relating to an             \nundercapitalized depository institution       \nsubsidiary, the BHC would be required to      \nguarantee the performance of the              \nundercapitalized subsidiary\u2019s capital         \nrestoration plan and might be liable for civil\nmoney damages for failure to fulfill its      \ncommitments on that guarantee. Furthermore, in\nthe event of the bankruptcy of the BHC, the   \nguarantee would take priority over the BHC\u2019s  \ngeneral unsecured creditors, as described in  \n\u201cSource of Strength\u201d above. Volcker Rule and  \nOther Restrictions on Activities. As a BHC, we\nare subject to limitations on the types of    \nbusiness activities we may engage in. Volcker \nRule. The Volcker Rule prohibits \u201cproprietary \ntrading,\u201d but permits activities such as      \nunderwriting, market making and risk-         \nmitigation hedging, requires an extensive     \ncompliance program and includes additional    \nreporting and record-keeping requirements. In \naddition, the Volcker Rule limits the         \nsponsorship of, and investment in, \u201ccovered   \nfunds\u201d (as defined in the rule) by banking    \nentities, including us. It also limits certain\ntypes of transactions between us and our      \nsponsored and advised funds, similar to the   \nlimitations on transactions between depository\ninstitutions and their affiliates. Covered    \nfunds include our private equity funds,       \ncertain of our credit and real estate funds,  \nour hedge funds and certain other investment  \nstructures. The limitation on investments in  \ncovered funds requires us to limit our        \ninvestment in each such fund to 3% or less of \nthe fund\u2019s net asset value, and to limit our  \naggregate investment in all such funds to 3%  \nor less of our Tier 1 capital. The FRB has    \nextended the conformance period to July 2022  \nfor our investments in, and relationships     \nwith, certain legacy \u201cilliquid funds\u201d (as     \ndefined in the Volcker Rule) that were in     \nplace prior to December 2013. See Note 8 to   \nthe consolidated financial statements in Part \nII, Item 8 of this Form 10-Kfor further       \ninformation about our investments in such     \nfunds. The FRB, OCC, FDIC, CFTC and SEC       \n(Volcker Rule regulators) finalized amendments\nin October 2019 to their regulations          \nimplementing the Volcker Rule, tailoring      \ncompliance requirements based on the size and \nscope of a banking entity\u2019s trading activities\nand clarifying and amending certain           \ndefinitions, requirements and exemptions.     \nCompliance with these amendments became       \neffective in January 2021. In addition, in    \nJune 2020 the Volcker Rule regulators         \nfinalized their previously proposed amendments\nto the Volcker Rule\u2019s regulations relating to \ncovered funds. These amendments established   \nnew exclusions from the covered fund          \ndefinition for certain types of investment    \nvehicles, modified the eligibility criteria   \nfor certain existing exclusions, and clarified\nand modified other provisions governing       \nbanking entities\u2019 investments in and other    \ntransactions and relationships involving      \ncovered funds, including clarifying that      \ninvestments alongside covered funds are not   \ntreated as investments in covered funds       \nsubject to the 3% limitation noted above if   \ncertain conditions are met. These amendments  \nbecame effective in October 2020.             \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    17  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOther Restrictions. FHCs generally can engage \nin a broader range of financial and related   \nactivities than are otherwise permissible for \nBHCs as long as they continue to meet the     \neligibility requirements for FHCs. The broader\nrange of permissible activities for FHCs      \nincludes underwriting, dealing and making     \nmarkets in securities and making investments  \nin non-FHCs(merchant banking activities). In  \naddition, certain FHCs, including us, are     \npermitted to engage in certain commodities    \nactivities in the U.S. that may otherwise be  \nimpermissible for BHCs, so long as the assets \nheld pursuant to these activities do not equal\n5% or more of their consolidated assets. The  \nFRB, however, has the authority to limit an   \nFHC\u2019s ability to conduct activities that would\notherwise be permissible, and will likely do  \nso if the FHC does not satisfactorily meet    \ncertain requirements of the FRB. For example, \nif an FHC or any of its U.S. depository       \ninstitution subsidiaries ceases to maintain   \nits status as well-capitalized or well-       \nmanaged, the FRB may impose corrective capital\nand/or managerial requirements, as well as    \nadditional limitations or conditions. If the  \ndeficiencies persist, the FHC may be required \nto divest its U.S. depository institution     \nsubsidiaries or to cease engaging in          \nactivities other than the business of banking \nand certain closely related activities. If any\nIDI subsidiary of an FHC fails to maintain at \nleast a \u201csatisfactory\u201d rating under the       \nCommunity Reinvestment Act, the FHC would be  \nsubject to restrictions on certain new        \nactivities and acquisitions. In addition, we  \nare required to obtain prior FRB approval     \nbefore engaging in certain banking and other  \nfinancial activities both within and outside  \nthe U.S. The FRB issued a proposed rule in    \nSeptember 2016 which, if adopted, would impose\nnew requirements on the physical commodity    \nactivities and certain merchant banking       \nactivities of FHCs, including, among other    \nthings, additional capital requirements,      \nstringent quantitative limits on permissible  \nphysical trading activity, and new public     \nreporting requirements. In addition, in a     \nSeptember 2016 report, the FRB recommended    \nthat Congress repeal authorities for FHCs to  \nengage in merchant banking activities and for \ncertain FHCs to engage in certain otherwise   \nimpermissible commodities activities. Since   \nJanuary 2020, U.S. G-SIBs,like us, have been  \nrequired to comply with a rule regarding      \nsingle counterparty credit limits, which      \nimposes more stringent requirements for credit\nexposures among major financial institutions. \nIn addition, in 2011, the FRB proposed early  \nremediation requirements, which are modeled on\nthe prompt corrective action regime, described\nin \u201cPrompt Corrective Action\u201d above, but are  \ndesigned to require action to begin in earlier\nstages of a company\u2019s financial distress,     \nbased on a range of triggers, including       \ncapital and leverage, stress test results,    \nliquidity and risk management. The New York   \nState banking law imposes lending limits      \n(which take into account credit exposure from \nderivative transactions) and other            \nrequirements that could impact the manner and \nscope of GS Bank USA\u2019s activities. The U.S.   \nfederal bank regulatory agencies have issued  \nguidance that focuses on transaction          \nstructures and risk management frameworks and \nthat outlines high-level principles for safe- \nand-soundleveraged lending, including         \nunderwriting standards, valuation and stress  \ntesting. This guidance has, among other       \nthings, limited the percentage amount of debt \nthat can be included in certain transactions. \nAs a German credit institution, GSBE will     \nbecome subject to Volcker Rule-type           \nprohibitions in Germany on \u201cproprietary       \ntrading\u201d as well as lending and guarantee     \nbusinesses with hedge funds and other highly- \nleveraged funds once its assets exceed certain\nthresholds. U.K. banks that have over \u00a325     \nbillion of core retail deposits are required  \nto separate their retail banking services from\ntheir investment and international banking    \nactivities, commonly known as \u201cring-fencing.\u201d \nGSIB is not currently subject to the ring-    \nfencing requirement and if it were to become  \nsubject to it, GSIB would need to make        \nsignificant operational and structural        \nchanges.

In Europe, we provide broker- \ndealer services, including through GSI, GSBE  \nand GSPIC, that are subject to oversight by   \nnational regulators. These services are       \nregulated in accordance with U.K., E.U. and   \nnational laws and regulations. These laws     \nrequire, among other things, compliance with  \ncertain capital adequacy and liquidity        \nstandards, customer protection requirements   \nand market conduct and trade reporting rules. \nCertain of our European subsidiaries are also \nregulated by the securities, derivatives and  \ncommodities exchanges of which they are       \nmembers. Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.        \n(GSJCL), our regulated Japanese broker-dealer,\nis subject to capital requirements imposed by \nJapan\u2019s Financial Services Agency.

Our       \nexchange-based market-making activities are   \nsubject to extensive regulation by a number of\nsecurities exchanges. As a market maker on    \nexchanges, we are required to maintain orderly\nmarkets in the securities to which we are     \nassigned. In the E.U. and the U.K., MiFID II  \nincludes extensive market structure reforms,  \nsuch as the establishment of new trading venue\ncategories for the purposes of discharging the\nobligation to trade OTC derivatives on a      \ntrading platform and enhanced pre-and post-   \ntrade transparency covering a wider range of  \nfinancial instruments. In equities, MiFID II  \nintroduced volume caps on non-                \ntransparentliquidity trading for trading      \nvenues, limited the use of broker-dealer      \ncrossing networks and created a new regime for\nsystematic internalizers, which are investment\nfirms that execute client transactions outside\na trading venue. Additional control           \nrequirements were introduced for algorithmic  \ntrading, high frequency trading and direct    \nelectronic access. Commodities trading firms  \nare required to calculate their positions and \nadhere to specific position limits. Other     \nreforms introduced enhanced transaction       \nreporting, the publication of best execution  \ndata by investment firms and trading venues,  \ntransparency on costs and charges of service  \nto investors, changes to the way investment   \nmanagers can pay for the receipt of investment\nresearch, rules limiting the payment and      \nreceipt of soft commissions and other forms of\ninducements, and mandatory unbundling for     \nbroker-dealers between execution and other    \nmajor services. The SEC requires broker-      \ndealers to act in the best interest of their  \ncustomers, and also issued an interpretation  \nclarifying the SEC\u2019s views of the existing    \nfiduciary duty owed by investment advisers to \ntheir clients. Additionally, the SEC adopted a\nrule that requires broker-dealers and         \ninvestment advisers to provide a standardized,\nshort-form disclosure highlighting services   \noffered, applicable standards of conduct, fees\nand costs, the differences between brokerage  \nand advisory services, and any conflicts of   \ninterest. Requirements under these rules      \nbecame effective in June 2020. Several states \nhave adopted or proposed adopting uniform     \nfiduciary duty standards applicable to broker-\ndealers and advisers. The SEC, FINRA and      \nregulators in various non-U.S.jurisdictions   \nhave imposed both conduct-based and           \ndisclosure-based requirements with respect to \nresearch reports and research analysts and may\nimpose additional regulations. GS&Co., GS Bank\nUSA and other U.S. subsidiaries are also      \nsubject to rules adopted by U.S. federal      \nagencies pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that  \nrequire any person who organizes or initiates \ncertain asset-backed securities transactions  \nto retain a portion (generally, at least five \npercent) of any credit risk that the person   \nconveys to a third party. For certain         \nsecuritization transactions, retention by     \nthird-party purchasers may satisfy this       \nrequirement. Certain of our                   \nnon-U.S.subsidiaries, including GSI, are      \nsubject to risk retention requirements in     \nconnection with securitization activities.    \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    19  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSwaps, Derivatives and Commodities Regulation \nThe commodity futures, commodity options and  \nswaps industry in the U.S. is subject to      \nregulation under the U.S. Commodity Exchange  \nAct (CEA). The CFTC is the U.S. federal agency\ncharged with the administration of the CEA. In\naddition, the SEC is the U.S. federal agency  \ncharged with the regulation of security-based \nswaps. The rules and regulations of various   \nself-regulatory organizations, such as the    \nChicago Mercantile Exchange, other futures    \nexchanges and the National Futures            \nAssociation, also govern commodity futures,   \ncommodity options and swaps activities. The   \nterms \u201cswaps\u201d and \u201csecurity-based swaps\u201d      \ninclude a wide variety of derivative          \ninstruments in addition to those              \nconventionally referred to as swaps (including\ncertain forward contracts and options), and   \nrelate to a wide variety of underlying assets \nor obligations, including currencies,         \ncommodities, interest or other monetary rates,\nyields, indices, securities, credit events,   \nloans and other financial obligations. CFTC   \nrules require registration of swap dealers,   \nmandatory clearing and execution of interest  \nrate and credit default swaps and real-time   \npublic reporting and adherence to business    \nconduct standards for all in-scopeswaps.      \nGS&Co. and other subsidiaries, including GS   \nBank USA, GSI, GSBE and J. Aron & Company LLC \n(J. Aron), are registered with the CFTC as    \nswap dealers. In July 2020, the CFTC adopted  \nfinal rules establishing capital requirements \nfor swap dealers that are not subject to the  \ncapital rules of a prudential regulator, such \nas the FRB. The CFTC also adopted financial   \nreporting requirements for covered swap       \nentities and amended existing capital rules   \nfor CFTC-registered futures commission        \nmerchants to provide explicit capital         \nrequirements for proprietary positions in     \nswaps and security-based swaps that are not   \ncleared by a clearing organization. Compliance\nwith the final rules is required by October 6,\n2021. Certain of our registered swap dealers, \nincluding J. Aron, will be subject to the     \nCFTC\u2019s capital requirements. Our affiliates   \nregistered as swap dealers are subject to the \nmargin rules issued by the CFTC (in the case  \nof our non-bankswap dealers) and the FRB (in  \nthe case of GS Bank USA and GSBE). The rules  \nfor variation margin have become effective,   \nand those for initial margin will phase in    \nthrough September 2022 depending on certain   \nactivity levels of the swap dealer and the    \nrelevant counterparty. Inter-affiliate        \ntransactions under the CFTC margin rules are  \ngenerally exempt from initial margin          \nrequirements. In June 2020, the FRB adopted a \nfinal rule that exempts inter-affiliate swaps \nfrom its initial margin requirements subject  \nto certain thresholds. The CFTC has adopted   \nrules relating to cross-border regulation of  \nswaps, business conduct and registration      \nrequirements. The CFTC has entered into       \nagreements with certain non-U.S.regulators,   \nincluding in the E.U., regarding the cross-   \nborder regulation of derivatives and the      \nmutual recognition of cross-border clearing   \nhouses, and has approved substituted          \ncompliance with certain non-U.S.regulations,  \nincluding E.U. regulations, related to certain\nbusiness conduct requirements and margin      \nrules. The U.S. prudential regulators have not\nyet made a determination with respect to      \nsubstituted compliance for transactions       \nsubject to non-U.S.margin rules. Similar types\nof swap regulation have been proposed or      \nadopted in jurisdictions outside the U.S.,    \nincluding in the E.U. and Japan. For example, \nthe E.U. and the U.K. have established        \nregulatory requirements relating to portfolio \nreconciliation and reporting, clearing certain\nOTC derivatives and margining for uncleared   \nderivatives activities under the European     \nMarket Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). SEC  \nrules govern the registration and regulation  \nof security-based swap dealers. The SEC       \nadopted a number of rules and rule amendments \nfor security-based swap dealers in 2019,      \nincluding (i) capital, margin and segregation \nrequirements, (ii) record-keeping, reporting  \nand notification requirements, and (iii) the  \napplication of risk mitigation techniques to  \nuncleared portfolios of security-based swaps  \nand the cross-border application of certain   \nsecurity-based swap requirements. The         \ncompliance date for these SEC rules, as well  \nas SEC rules addressing registration          \nrequirements and business conduct standards,  \nis generally October 2021. We anticipate that \ncertain of our subsidiaries will register with\nthe SEC as security-based swap dealers and    \nbecome subject to the SEC\u2019s regulations       \nregarding security-based swaps.               \n                                      \n  20    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe CFTC has adopted position limit rules that\nwill limit the size of positions in physical  \ncommodity derivatives that can be held by any \nentity, or any group of affiliates or other   \nparties trading under common control, subject \nto certain exemptions, such as for bona fide  \nhedging positions. However, effective in 2023,\nthe new rules will eliminate the risk         \nmanagement exemption, which allowed swap      \ndealers to claim an exemption for the hedging \nof swap-related risks. The new CFTC position  \nlimits will apply to certain positions in     \nswaps, as well as futures and options on      \nfutures, on physical commodities, and limits  \nwill apply to both physically and cash settled\npositions. Currently, position limits on      \nfutures on physical commodities are           \nadministered by the relevant exchanges, with  \nthe exception of futures on certain           \nagricultural commodities, which are           \nadministered by the CFTC. Under the CFTC\u2019s    \nposition limit rules, all futures and options \non futures on an enumerated list of physical  \ncommodities, including certain agricultural,  \nenergy and metals commodities, as well as     \nrelated swaps, will be subject to the CFTC\u2019s  \nposition limits. The new position limit rules \nimpose limits in the spot month only (i.e.,   \nduring the delivery period for the physical   \ncommodities, which is typically a period of   \nseveral days), although the CFTC may in the   \nfuture impose limits in non-spotmonths as     \nwell. CFTC spot and non-spotmonth limits will \ncontinue to apply to futures on certain legacy\nagricultural commodities. J.

The \nguidance sets forth the following three key   \nprinciples with respect to incentive          \ncompensation arrangements: (i) the            \narrangements should provide employees with    \nincentives that appropriately balance risk and\nfinancial results in a manner that does not   \nencourage employees to expose their           \norganizations to imprudent risk; (ii) the     \narrangements should be compatible with        \neffective controls and risk management; and   \n(iii) the arrangements should be supported by \nstrong corporate governance. The guidance     \nprovides that supervisory findings with       \nrespect to incentive compensation will be     \nincorporated, as appropriate, into the        \norganization\u2019s supervisory ratings, which can \naffect its ability to make acquisitions or    \nperform other actions. The guidance also notes\nthat enforcement actions may be taken against \na banking organization if its incentive       \ncompensation arrangements or related risk     \nmanagement, control or governance processes   \npose a risk to the organization\u2019s safety and  \nsoundness. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the    \nU.S. financial regulators, including the FRB  \nand SEC, to adopt rules on incentive-based    \npayment arrangements at specified regulated   \nentities having at least $1 billion in total  \nassets. The U.S. financial regulators proposed\nrevised rules in 2016, which have not been    \nfinalized. The NYDFS issued guidance in       \nOctober 2016 emphasizing that its regulated   \nbanking institutions, including GS Bank USA,  \nmust ensure that any incentive compensation   \narrangements tied to employee performance     \nindicators are subject to effective risk      \nmanagement, oversight and control. In the     \nE.U., the CRR and CRD IV include compensation \nprovisions designed to implement the FSB\u2019s    \ncompensation standards. These rules have been \nimplemented by E.U. member states and in the  \nU.K. and, among other things, limit the ratio \nof variable to fixed compensation of all      \nemployees at GSBE and certain employees at our\nother operating subsidiaries in the E.U. and  \nin the U.K., including those employees        \nidentified as having a material impact on the \nrisk profile of regulated entities. CRR II and\nCRD V amend certain aspects of these rules,   \nincluding, among other things, by increasing  \nminimum variable compensation deferral        \nperiods. Substantially similar requirements   \napply in the U.K. in relation to GSI and GSIB.\nThe E.U. has also introduced rules regulating \ncompensation for certain persons providing    \nservices to certain investment funds. These   \nrequirements are in addition to the guidance  \nissued by U.S. financial regulators and the   \nDodd-Frank Act provision, each as described   \nabove. Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Bribery \nRules and Regulations The U.S. Bank Secrecy   \nAct (BSA), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act  \nof 2001 (PATRIOT Act), contains anti-money    \nlaundering and financial transparency laws and\nmandates the implementation of various        \nregulations applicable to all financial       \ninstitutions, including standards for         \nverifying client identification at account    \nopening, and obligations to monitor client    \ntransactions and report suspicious activities.\nThrough these and other provisions, the BSA   \nand the PATRIOT Act seek to promote the       \nidentification of parties that may be involved\nin terrorism, money laundering or other       \nsuspicious activities. Anti-money laundering  \nlaws outside the U.S. contain some similar    \nprovisions. In January 2021, the Anti-Money   \nLaundering Act of 2020 (AMLA), which amends   \nthe BSA, was enacted. The AMLA is intended to \ncomprehensively reform and modernize U.S.     \nanti-money laundering laws. Among other       \nthings, the AMLA codifies a risk-based        \napproach to anti-money laundering compliance  \nfor financial institutions; requires the      \ndevelopment of standards by the U.S.          \nDepartment of the Treasury for evaluating     \ntechnology and internal processes for BSA     \ncompliance; and expands enforcement- and      \ninvestigation-related authority, including a  \nsignificant expansion in the available        \nsanctions for certain BSA violations and      \ninstituting BSA whistleblower incentives and  \nprotections. Many of the statutory provisions \nin the AMLA will require additional           \nrulemakings, reports and other measures, and  \nthe impact of the AMLA will depend on, among  \nother things, rulemaking and implementation   \nguidance. In addition, we are subject to laws \nand regulations worldwide, including the U.S. \nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the  \nU.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt and     \nillegal payments to, and hiring practices with\nregard to, government officials and others.   \nThe scope of the types of payments or other   \nbenefits covered by these laws is very broad  \nand regulators are frequently using           \nenforcement proceedings to define the scope of\nthese laws. The obligation of financial       \ninstitutions to identify their clients, to    \nmonitor for and report suspicious             \ntransactions, to monitor direct and indirect  \npayments to politically exposed persons, to   \nrespond to requests for information by        \nregulatory authorities and law enforcement    \nagencies, and to share information with other \nfinancial institutions, has required the      \nimplementation and maintenance of internal    \npractices, procedures and controls.           \n                                      \n  22    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The GDPR has heightened our privacy   \ncompliance obligations, impacted certain of   \nour businesses\u2019 collection, processing and    \nretention of personal data and imposed strict \nstandards for reporting data breaches. The    \nGDPR also provides for significant penalties  \nfor non-compliance.In addition, the CCPA      \nimposes compliance obligations with regard to \nthe collection, use and disclosure of personal\ninformation. The substantive obligations under\nthe 2020 amendments to the CCPA become        \neffective on January 1, 2023. In addition,    \nseveral other states and non-U.S.jurisdictions\nhave enacted, or are proposing, privacy and   \ndata protection laws similar to the GDPR and  \nthe CCPA. The NYDFS also requires financial   \ninstitutions regulated by the NYDFS, including\nGS Bank USA, to, among other things, (i)      \nestablish and maintain a cyber security       \nprogram designed to ensure the                \nconfidentiality, integrity and availability of\ntheir information systems; (ii) implement and \nmaintain a written cyber security policy      \nsetting forth policies and procedures for the \nprotection of their information systems and   \nnonpublic information; and (iii) designate a  \nChief Information Security Officer. In        \nDecember 2020, the U.S. federal bank          \nregulatory agencies released a proposed rule  \nregarding notification requirements for       \nbanking organizations related to significant  \ncomputer security incidents. Under the        \nproposal, a BHC or state member bank, such as \nGroup Inc. or GS Bank USA, would be required  \nto notify the FRB within 36 hours of incidents\nthat could result in the banking              \norganization\u2019s inability to deliver services  \nto a material portion of its customer base,   \njeopardize the viability of key operations of \nthe banking organization, or impact the       \nstability of the financial sector.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur businesses have been and may in the future\nbe adversely affected by declining asset      \nvalues, particularly where we have net \u201clong\u201d \npositions, receive fees based on the value of \nassets managed, or receive or post collateral.\nMany of our businesses have net \u201clong\u201d        \npositions in debt securities, loans,          \nderivatives, mortgages, equities (including   \nprivate equity and real estate) and most other\nasset classes. These include positions we take\nwhen we act as a principal to facilitate our  \nclients\u2019 activities, including our exchange-  \nbased market-making activities, or commit     \nlarge amounts of capital to maintain positions\nin interest rate and credit products, as well \nas through our currencies, commodities,       \nequities and mortgage-related activities. In  \naddition, we invest in similar asset classes. \nSubstantially all of our investing and market-\nmaking positions and a portion of our loans   \nare marked-to-marketon a daily basis and      \ndeclines in asset values directly and         \nimmediately impact our earnings, unless we    \nhave effectively \u201chedged\u201d our exposures to    \nthose declines. In certain circumstances      \n(particularly in the case of credit products, \nincluding leveraged loans, and private        \nequities or other securities that are not     \nfreely tradable or lack established and liquid\ntrading markets), it may not be possible or   \neconomic to hedge our exposures and to the    \nextent that we do so the hedge may be         \nineffective or may greatly reduce our ability \nto profit from increases in the values of the \nassets. Sudden declines and significant       \nvolatility in the prices of assets have in the\npast and may in the future substantially      \ncurtail or eliminate the trading markets for  \ncertain assets, which may make it difficult to\nsell, hedge or value such assets. The         \ninability to sell or effectively hedge assets \nreduces our ability to limit losses in such   \npositions and the difficulty in valuing assets\nmay negatively affect our capital, liquidity  \nor leverage ratios, increase our funding costs\nand generally require us to maintain          \nadditional capital. In our exchange-based     \nmarket-making activities, we are obligated by \nstock exchange rules to maintain an orderly   \nmarket, including by purchasing securities in \na declining market. In markets where asset    \nvalues are declining and in volatile markets, \nthis results in losses and an increased need  \nfor liquidity. We receive asset-based         \nmanagement fees based on the value of our     \nclients\u2019 portfolios or investment in funds    \nmanaged by us and, in some cases, we also     \nreceive incentive fees based on increases in  \nthe value of such investments. Declines in    \nasset values would ordinarily reduce the value\nof our clients\u2019 portfolios or fund assets,    \nwhich in turn would ordinarily reduce the fees\nwe earn for managing such assets. We post     \ncollateral to support our obligations and     \nreceive collateral that supports the          \nobligations of our clients and counterparties.\nWhen the value of the assets posted as        \ncollateral or the credit ratings of the party \nposting collateral decline, the party posting \nthe collateral may need to provide additional \ncollateral or, if possible, reduce its trading\nposition. An example of such a situation is a \n\u201cmargin call\u201d in connection with a brokerage  \naccount. Therefore, declines in the value of  \nasset classes used as collateral mean that    \neither the cost of funding positions is       \nincreased or the size of positions is         \ndecreased. If we are the party providing      \ncollateral, this can increase our costs and   \nreduce our profitability and if we are the    \nparty receiving collateral, this can also     \nreduce our profitability by reducing the level\nof business done with our clients and         \ncounterparties. In addition, volatile or less \nliquid markets increase the difficulty of     \nvaluing assets, which can lead to costly and  \ntime-consuming disputes over asset values and \nthe level of required collateral, as well as  \nincreased credit risk to the recipient of the \ncollateral due to delays in receiving adequate\ncollateral. In cases where we foreclose on    \ncollateral, sudden declines in the value or   \nliquidity of the collateral may, despite      \ncredit monitoring, over-collateralization, the\nability to call for additional collateral or  \nthe ability to force repayment of the         \nunderlying obligation, result in significant  \nlosses to us, especially where there is a     \nsingle type of collateral supporting the      \nobligation. In addition, we have been and may \nin the future be subject to claims that the   \nforeclosure was not permitted under the legal \ndocuments, was conducted in an improper manner\nor caused a client or counterparty to go out  \nof business. Our market-making activities have\nbeen and may in the future be affected by     \nchanges in the levels of market volatility.   \nCertain of our market-making activities depend\non market volatility to provide trading and   \narbitrage opportunities to our clients, and   \ndecreases in volatility have reduced and may  \nin the future reduce these opportunities and  \nthe level of client activity associated with  \nthem and adversely affect the results of these\nactivities. Increased volatility, while it can\nincrease trading volumes and spreads, also    \nincreases risk as measured by Value-at-       \nRisk(VaR) and may expose us to increased risks\nin connection with our market-making          \nactivities or cause us to reduce our inventory\nin order to avoid increasing our VaR. Limiting\nthe size of our market-making positions can   \nadversely affect our profitability. In periods\nwhen volatility is increasing, but asset      \nvalues are declining significantly, it may not\nbe possible to sell assets at all or it may   \nonly be possible to do so at steep discounts. \nIn those circumstances we may be forced to    \neither take on additional risk or to realize  \nlosses in order to decrease our VaR. In       \naddition, increases in volatility increase the\nlevel of our RWAs, which increases our capital\nrequirements.                                 \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    29  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur investment banking, client intermediation,\nasset management and wealth management        \nbusinesses have been adversely affected and   \nmay in the future be adversely affected by    \nmarket uncertainty or lack of confidence among\ninvestors and CEOs due to declines in economic\nactivity and other unfavorable economic,      \ngeopolitical or market conditions. Our        \ninvestment banking business has been and may  \nin the future be adversely affected by market \nconditions. Poor economic conditions and other\nuncertain geopolitical conditions may         \nadversely affect and have in the past         \nadversely affected investor and CEO           \nconfidence, resulting in significant industry-\nwide declines in the size and number of       \nunderwritings and of financial advisory       \ntransactions, which would likely have an      \nadverse effect on our revenues and our profit \nmargins. In particular, because a significant \nportion of our investment banking revenues is \nderived from our participation in large       \ntransactions, a decline in the number of large\ntransactions has in the past and would in the \nfuture adversely affect our investment banking\nbusiness. In certain circumstances, market    \nuncertainty or general declines in market or  \neconomic activity may adversely affect our    \nclient intermediation businesses by decreasing\nlevels of overall activity or by decreasing   \nvolatility, but at other times market         \nuncertainty and even declining economic       \nactivity may result in higher trading volumes \nor higher spreads or both. Market uncertainty,\nvolatility and adverse economic conditions, as\nwell as declines in asset values, may cause   \nour clients to transfer their assets out of   \nour fundsor other products or their brokerage \naccounts and result in reduced net revenues,  \nprincipally in our asset management and wealth\nmanagement businesses. Even if clients do not \nwithdraw their funds, they may invest them in \nproducts that generate less fee income. Our   \nasset management and wealth management        \nbusinesses have been and may in the future be \nadversely affected by the poor investment     \nperformance of our investment products or a   \nclient preference for products other than     \nthose which we offer or for products that     \ngenerate lower fees. Poor investment returns  \nin our asset management and wealth management \nbusinesses, due to either general market      \nconditions or underperformance (relative to   \nour competitors or to benchmarks) by funds or \naccounts that we manage or investment products\nthat we design or sell, affects our ability to\nretain existing assets and to attract new     \nclients or additional assets from existing    \nclients. This could affect the management and \nincentive fees that we earn on assets under   \nsupervision (AUS) or the commissions and net  \nspreads that we earn for selling other        \ninvestment products, such as structured notes \nor derivatives. To the extent that our clients\nchoose to invest in products that we do not   \ncurrently offer, we will suffer outflows and a\nloss of management fees. Further, if, due to  \nchanges in investor sentiment or the relative \nperformance of certain asset classes or       \notherwise, clients continue to invest in      \nproducts that generate lower fees (e.g.,      \npassively managed or fixed income products),  \nour average effective management fee would    \ncontinue to decline and our asset management  \nand wealth management businesses could be     \nadversely affected. Liquidity Our liquidity,  \nprofitability and businesses may be adversely \naffected by an inability to access the debt   \ncapital markets or to sell assets. Liquidity  \nis essential to our businesses. It is of      \ncritical importance to us, as most of the     \nfailures of financial institutions have       \noccurred in large part due to insufficient    \nliquidity. Our liquidity may be impaired by an\ninability to access secured and/or unsecured  \ndebt markets, an inability to raise deposits, \nan inability to access funds from our         \nsubsidiaries or otherwise allocate liquidity  \noptimally, an inability to sell assets or     \nredeem our investments, lack of timely        \nsettlement of transactions, unusual deposit   \noutflows, or other unforeseen outflows of cash\nor collateral, such as in March 2020, when    \ncorporate clients drew on revolving credit    \nfacilities in response to the                 \nCOVID-19pandemic. This situation may arise due\nto circumstances that we may be unable to     \ncontrol, such as a general market or economic \ndisruption or an operational problem that     \naffects third parties or us, or even by the   \nperception among market participants that we, \nor other market participants, are experiencing\ngreater liquidity risk.                       \n                                      \n  30    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe employ structured products to benefit our  \nclients and hedge our own risks. The financial\ninstruments that we hold and the contracts to \nwhich we are a party are often complex, and   \nthese complex structured products often do not\nhave readily available markets to access in   \ntimes of liquidity stress. Our investing and  \nfinancing activities may lead to situations   \nwhere the holdings from these activities      \nrepresent a significant portion of specific   \nmarkets, which could restrict liquidity for   \nour positions. Further, our ability to sell   \nassets may be impaired if there is not        \ngenerally a liquid market for such assets, as \nwell as in circumstances where other market   \nparticipants are seeking to sell similar      \notherwise generally liquid assets at the same \ntime, as is likely to occur in a liquidity or \nother market crisis or in response to changes \nto rules or regulations. In addition,         \nfinancial institutions with which we interact \nmay exercise set-offrights or the right to    \nrequire additional collateral, including in   \ndifficult market conditions, which could      \nfurther impair our liquidity. Regulatory      \nchanges relating to liquidity may also        \nnegatively impact our results of operations   \nand competitive position. Numerous regulations\nhave been adopted to introduce more stringent \nliquidity requirements for large financial    \ninstitutions. These regulations address, among\nother matters, liquidity stress testing,      \nminimum liquidity requirements, wholesale     \nfunding, limitations on the issuance of short-\nterm debt and structured notes, deductions for\nholdings of TLAC and prohibitions on parent   \nguarantees that are subject to certain cross- \ndefaults. New and prospective liquidity-      \nrelated regulations may overlap with, and be  \nimpacted by, other regulatory changes,        \nincluding rules relating to minimum long-term \ndebt requirements and TLAC, guidance on the   \ntreatment of brokered deposits and the        \ncapital, leverage and resolution and recovery \nframeworks applicable to large financial      \ninstitutions. Given the overlap and complex   \ninteractions among these new and prospective  \nregulations, they may have unintended         \ncumulative effects, and their full impact will\nremain uncertain, while regulatory reforms are\nbeing adopted and market practices develop.   \nOur businesses have been and may in the future\nbe adversely affected by disruptions or lack  \nof liquidity in the credit markets, including \nreduced access to credit and higher costs of  \nobtaining credit. Widening credit spreads, as \nwell as significant declines in the           \navailability of credit, have in the past      \nadversely affected our ability to borrow on a \nsecured and unsecured basis and may do so in  \nthe future. We fund ourselves on an unsecured \nbasis by issuing long-term debt and commercial\npaper, by raising deposits at our bank        \nsubsidiaries, by issuing hybrid financial     \ninstruments and by obtaining loans or lines of\ncredit from commercial or other banking       \nentities. We seek to finance many of our      \nassets on a secured basis. Any disruptions in \nthe credit markets may make it harder and more\nexpensive to obtain funding for our           \nbusinesses. If our available funding is       \nlimited or we are forced to fund our          \noperations at a higher cost, these conditions \nmay require us to curtail our business        \nactivities and increase our cost of funding,  \nboth of which could reduce our profitability, \nparticularly in our businesses that involve   \ninvesting, lending and market making. Our     \nclients engaging in mergers, acquisitions and \nother types of strategic transactions often   \nrely on access to the secured and unsecured   \ncredit markets to finance their transactions. \nA lack of available credit or an increased    \ncost of credit can adversely affect the size, \nvolume and timing of our clients\u2019 merger and  \nacquisition transactions, particularly large  \ntransactions, and adversely affect our        \nfinancial advisory and underwriting           \nbusinesses. Our credit businesses have been   \nand may in the future be negatively affected  \nby a lack of liquidity in credit markets. A   \nlack of liquidity reduces price transparency, \nincreases price volatility and decreases      \ntransaction volumes and size, all of which can\nincrease transaction risk or decrease the     \nprofitability of these businesses.            \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    31  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReductions in our credit ratings or an        \nincrease in our credit spreads may adversely  \naffect our liquidity and cost of funding. Our \ncredit ratings are important to our liquidity.\nA reduction in our credit ratings could       \nadversely affect our liquidity and competitive\nposition, increase our borrowing costs, limit \nour access to the capital markets or trigger  \nour obligations under certain provisions in   \nsome of our trading and collateralized        \nfinancing contracts. Under these provisions,  \ncounterparties could be permitted to terminate\ncontracts with us or require us to post       \nadditional collateral. Termination of our     \ntrading and collateralized financing contracts\ncould cause us to sustain losses and impair   \nour liquidity by requiring us to find other   \nsources of financing or to make significant   \ncash payments or securities movements. As of  \nDecember 2020, our counterparties could have  \ncalled for additional collateral or           \ntermination payments related to our net       \nderivative liabilities under bilateral        \nagreements in an aggregate amount of $481     \nmillion in the event of a one-notchdowngrade  \nof our credit ratings and $1.39 billion in the\nevent of a two-notchdowngrade of our credit   \nratings.

Our cost of obtaining long-term    \nunsecured funding is directly related to our  \ncredit spreads (the amount in excess of the   \ninterest rate of benchmark securities that we \nneed to pay). Increases in our credit spreads \ncan significantly increase our cost of this   \nfunding. Changes in credit spreads are        \ncontinuous, market-driven, and subject at     \ntimes to unpredictable and highly volatile    \nmovements. Our credit spreads are also        \ninfluenced by market perceptions of our       \ncreditworthiness and movements in the costs to\npurchasers of credit default swaps referenced \nto our long-term debt. The market for credit  \ndefault swaps has proven to be extremely      \nvolatile and at times has lacked a high degree\nof transparency or liquidity. Group Inc. is a \nholding company and its liquidity depends on  \npayments from its subsidiaries, many of which \nare subject to legal, regulatory and other    \nrestrictions on providing funds or assets to  \nGroup Inc. Group Inc. is a holding company    \nand, therefore, depends on dividends,         \ndistributions and other payments from its     \nsubsidiaries to fund share repurchases and    \ndividend payments and to fund payments on its \nobligations, including debt obligations. Many \nof our subsidiaries, including our broker-    \ndealer and bank subsidiaries, are subject to  \nlaws that restrict dividend payments or       \nauthorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce\nthe flow of funds from those subsidiaries to  \nGroup Inc. In addition, our broker-dealer and \nbank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions \non their ability to lend or transact with     \naffiliates and to minimum regulatory capital  \nand other requirements, as well as            \nrestrictions on their ability to use funds    \ndeposited with them in brokerage or bank      \naccounts to fund their businesses. Additional \nrestrictions on related-party transactions,   \nincreased capital and liquidity requirements  \nand additional limitations on the use of funds\non deposit in bank or brokerage accounts, as  \nwell as lower earnings, can reduce the amount \nof funds available to meet the obligations of \nGroup Inc., including under the FRB\u2019s source  \nof strength requirement, and even require     \nGroup Inc. to provide additional funding to   \nsuch subsidiaries. Restrictions or regulatory \naction of that kind could impede access to    \nfunds that Group Inc. needs to make payments  \non its obligations, including debt            \nobligations, or dividend payments. In         \naddition, Group Inc.\u2019s right to participate in\na distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s  \nliquidation or reorganization is subject to   \nthe prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s          \ncreditors. There has been a trend towards     \nincreased regulation and supervision of our   \nsubsidiaries by the governments and regulators\nin the countries in which those subsidiaries  \nare located or do business. Concerns about    \nprotecting clients and creditors of financial \ninstitutions that are controlled by persons or\nentities located outside of the country in    \nwhich such entities are located or do business\nhave caused or may cause a number of          \ngovernments and regulators to take additional \nsteps to \u201cring fence\u201d or require internal     \ntotal loss-absorbing capacity (which may also \nbe subject to \u201cbail-in\u201dpowers, as described   \nbelow) at those entities in order to protect  \nclients and creditors of those entities in the\nevent of financial difficulties involving     \nthose entities. The result has been and may   \ncontinue to be additional limitations on our  \nability to efficiently move capital and       \nliquidity among our affiliated entities, or to\nGroup Inc., including in times of liquidity   \nstress, thereby increasing the overall level  \nof capital and liquidity required by us on a  \nconsolidated basis.                           \n                                      \n  32    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nFurthermore, Group Inc. has guaranteed the    \npayment obligations of certain of its         \nsubsidiaries, including GS&Co. and GS Bank    \nUSA, subject to certain exceptions. In        \naddition, Group Inc. guarantees many of the   \nobligations of its other consolidated         \nsubsidiaries on a transaction-by-             \ntransactionbasis, as negotiated with          \ncounterparties. These guarantees may require  \nGroup Inc. to provide substantial funds or    \nassets to its subsidiaries or their creditors \nor counterparties at a time when Group Inc. is\nin need of liquidity to fund its own          \nobligations. The requirements for us and GS   \nBank USA to develop and submit recovery and   \nresolution plans to regulators, and the       \nincorporation of feedback received from       \nregulators, may require us to increase capital\nor liquidity levels or issue additional long- \nterm debt at Group Inc. or particular         \nsubsidiaries or otherwise incur additional or \nduplicative operational or other costs at     \nmultiple entities, and may reduce our ability \nto provide Group Inc. guarantees of the       \nobligations of our subsidiaries or raise debt \nat Group Inc. Resolution planning may also    \nimpair our ability to structure our           \nintercompany and external activities in a     \nmanner that we may otherwise deem most        \noperationally efficient. Furthermore,         \narrangements to facilitate our resolution     \nplanning may cause us to be subject to        \nadditional taxes. Any such limitations or     \nrequirements would be in addition to the legal\nand regulatory restrictions described above on\nour ability to engage in capital actions or   \nmake intercompany dividends or payments. See  \n\u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of  \nthis Form 10-Kfor further information about   \nregulatory restrictions. Credit Our           \nbusinesses, profitability and liquidity may be\nadversely affected by deterioration in the    \ncredit quality of or defaults by third        \nparties. We are exposed to the risk that third\nparties that owe us money, securities or other\nassets will not perform their obligations.    \nThese parties may default on their obligations\nto us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity,   \noperational failure or other reasons. A       \nfailure of a significant market participant,  \nor even concerns about a default by such an   \ninstitution, could lead to significant        \nliquidity problems, losses or defaults by     \nother institutions, which in turn could       \nadversely affect us. We are also subject to   \nthe risk that our rights against third parties\nmay not be enforceable in all circumstances.  \nIn addition, deterioration in the credit      \nquality of third parties whose securities or  \nobligations we hold, including a deterioration\nin the value of collateral posted by third    \nparties to secure their obligations to us     \nunder derivative contracts and loan           \nagreements, could result in losses and/or     \nadversely affect our ability to rehypothecate \nor otherwise use those securities or          \nobligations for liquidity purposes. A         \nsignificant downgrade in the credit ratings of\nour counterparties could also have a negative \nimpact on our results. While in many cases we \nare permitted to require additional collateral\nfrom counterparties that experience financial \ndifficulty, disputes may arise as to the      \namount of collateral we are entitled to       \nreceive and the value of pledged assets. The  \ntermination of contracts and the foreclosure  \non collateral may subject us to claims for the\nimproper exercise of our rights. Default      \nrates, downgrades and disputes with           \ncounterparties as to the valuation of         \ncollateral typically increase significantly in\ntimes of market stress, increased volatility  \nand illiquidity. As part of our clearing and  \nprime brokerage activities, we finance our    \nclients\u2019 positions, and we could be held      \nresponsible for the defaults or misconduct of \nour clients. Although we have limits and      \nregularly review credit exposures to specific \nclients and counterparties and to specific    \nindustries, countries and regions that we     \nbelieve may present credit concerns, default  \nrisk may arise from events or circumstances   \nthat are difficult to detect or foresee.      \nConcentration of risk increases the potential \nfor significant losses in our market-making,  \nunderwriting, investing and financing         \nactivities. Concentration of risk increases   \nthe potential for significant losses in our   \nmarket-making, underwriting, investing and    \nfinancing activities. The number and size of  \nthese transactions has affected and may in the\nfuture affect our results of operations in a  \ngiven period. Moreover, because of            \nconcentrated risk, we may suffer losses even  \nwhen economic and market conditions are       \ngenerally favorable for our competitors.      \nDisruptions in the credit markets can make it \ndifficult to hedge these credit exposures     \neffectively or economically. In addition, we  \nextend large commitments as part of our credit\norigination activities.                       \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    33  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act, and   \nsimilar rules adopted in other jurisdictions, \nrequire issuers of certain asset-backed       \nsecurities and any person who organizes and   \ninitiates certain asset-backed securities     \ntransactions to retain economic exposure to   \nthe asset, which has affected the cost of and \nstructures used in connection with these      \nsecuritization activities. Our inability to   \nreduce our credit risk by selling, syndicating\nor securitizing these positions, including    \nduring periods of market stress, could        \nnegatively affect our results of operations   \ndue to a decrease in the fair value of the    \npositions, including due to the insolvency or \nbankruptcy of the borrower, as well as the    \nloss of revenues associated with selling such \nsecurities or loans. In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, we may be subject to a concentration\nof credit risk to a particular counterparty,  \nborrower, issuer (including sovereign issuers)\nor geographic area or group of related        \ncountries, such as the E.U., and a failure or \ndowngrade of, or default by, such entity could\nnegatively impact our businesses, perhaps     \nmaterially, and the systems by which we set   \nlimits and monitor the level of our credit    \nexposure to individual entities, industries,  \ncountries and regions may not function as we  \nhave anticipated. Regulatory reform, including\nthe Dodd-Frank Act, has led to increased      \ncentralization of trading activity through    \nparticular clearing houses, central agents or \nexchanges, which has significantly increased  \nour concentration of risk with respect to     \nthese entities. While our activities expose us\nto many different industries, counterparties  \nand countries, we routinely execute a high    \nvolume of transactions with counterparties    \nengaged in financial services activities,     \nincluding brokers and dealers, commercial     \nbanks, clearing houses, exchanges and         \ninvestment funds. This has resulted in        \nsignificant credit concentration with respect \nto these counterparties. Derivative           \ntransactions and delayed documentation or     \nsettlements may expose us to credit risk,     \nunexpected risks and potential losses. We are \nparty to a large number of derivative         \ntransactions, including credit derivatives.   \nMany of these derivative instruments are      \nindividually negotiated and non-              \nstandardized,which can make exiting,          \ntransferring or settling positions difficult. \nMany credit derivatives require that we       \ndeliver to the counterparty the underlying    \nsecurity, loan or other obligation in order to\nreceive payment. In a number of cases, we do  \nnot hold the underlying security, loan or     \nother obligation and may not be able to obtain\nthe underlying security, loan or other        \nobligation. This could cause us to forfeit the\npayments due to us under these contracts or   \nresult in settlement delays with the attendant\ncredit and operational risk, as well as       \nincreased costs to us. Derivative transactions\nmay also involve the risk that documentation  \nhas not been properly executed, that executed \nagreements may not be enforceable against the \ncounterparty, or that obligations under such  \nagreements may not be able to be \u201cnetted\u201d     \nagainst other obligations with such           \ncounterparty. In addition, counterparties may \nclaim that such transactions were not         \nappropriate or authorized. As a signatory to  \nthe ISDA Universal Protocol or U.S. ISDA      \nProtocol (ISDA Protocols) and being subject to\nthe FRB\u2019s and FDIC\u2019s rules on QFCs and similar\nrules in other jurisdictions, we may not be   \nable to exercise remedies against             \ncounterparties and, as this new regime has not\nyet been tested, we may suffer risks or losses\nthat we would not have expected to suffer if  \nwe could immediately close out transactions   \nupon a termination event. Various             \nnon-U.S.regulators have adopted or proposed   \nregulations contemplated by the ISDA Universal\nProtocol, and those implementing regulations  \nmay result in additional limitations on our   \nability to exercise remedies against          \ncounterparties. The ISDA Protocols and these  \nrules and regulations extend to repurchase    \nagreements and other instruments that are not \nderivative contracts, and their impact will   \ndepend on the development of market practices \nand structures. Derivative contracts and other\ntransactions, including secondary bank loan   \npurchases and sales, entered into with third  \nparties are not always confirmed by the       \ncounterparties or settled on a timely basis.  \nWhile the transaction remains unconfirmed or  \nduring any delay in settlement, we are subject\nto heightened credit and operational risk and \nin the event of a default may find it more    \ndifficult to enforce our rights. In addition, \nas new complex derivative products are        \ncreated, covering a wider array of underlying \ncredit and other instruments, disputes about  \nthe terms of the underlying contracts could   \narise, which could impair our ability to      \neffectively manage our risk exposures from    \nthese products and subject us to increased    \ncosts. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act   \nrequiring central clearing of credit          \nderivatives and other OTC derivatives, or a   \nmarket shift toward standardized derivatives, \ncould reduce the risk associated with these   \ntransactions, but under certain circumstances \ncould also limit our ability to develop       \nderivatives that best suit the needs of our   \nclients and to hedge our own risks, and could \nadversely affect our profitability and has    \nincreased our credit exposure to central      \nclearing platforms.                           \n                                      \n  34    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The COVID-19pandemic has    \ncreated economic and financial disruptions    \nthat have in the past adversely affected and  \nmay in the future adversely affect our        \nbusiness, financial condition, liquidity and  \nresults of operations. The extent to which the\nCOVID-19pandemic will negatively affect our   \nbusinesses, financial condition, liquidity and\nresults of operations will depend on future   \ndevelopments, including the widespread        \navailability, use and effectiveness of        \nvaccines, which are highly uncertain and      \ncannot be predicted. While financial markets  \nhave rebounded from the significant declines  \nthat occurred earlier in the pandemic and     \nglobal economic conditions showed signs of    \nimprovement during the second half of 2020,   \nmany of the circumstances that arose or became\nmore pronounced after the onset of the        \nCOVID-19pandemic persisted at the end of the  \nyear, including (i) muted levels of business  \nactivity across many sectors of the economy,  \nrelatively weak consumer confidence and high  \nunemployment; (ii) elevated levels of market  \nvolatility; (iii) the federal funds rate and  \nyields on U.S. Treasury securities near zero; \n(iv) substantial uncertainty about whether    \npreviously announced merger and acquisition   \ndeals will be completed or restructured; (v)  \nheightened credit risk with regard to         \nindustries that have been most severely       \nimpacted by the pandemic, including oil and   \ngas, gaming and lodging, and airlines; (vi)   \ngreater emphasis by investors on liquidity    \nproducts, which generate lower fees, relative \nto risk assets, resulting in these products   \ncomprising a higher share of AUS as compared  \nto the pre-pandemiccomposition; and (vii)     \nhigher cyber security, information security   \nand operational risks as a result of work-    \nfrom-home arrangements. Depending on the      \nduration and severity of the pandemic going   \nforward, as well as the effects of the        \npandemic on consumer and corporate confidence,\nthe conditions noted above could continue for \nan extended period and other adverse          \ndevelopments may occur or reoccur, including  \n(i) a repeat, or worse, of the decline in the \nvaluation of equity, fixed-income and         \ncommodity markets that occurred at the outset \nof the pandemic; (ii) further declines in U.S.\ninterest rates, to zero or below; (iii) market\ndislocations that may make hedging strategies \nless effective or ineffective; (iv) a         \nreduction in fees on AUS due to declines in   \nthe valuation of assets or a protracted trend \ntoward asset classes that generate lower fees;\n(v) disruption in the new issuance markets for\ndebt and equity, leading to a decline in      \nactivity; (vi) a deterioration in the         \nliquidity profile of corporate borrowers,     \nresulting in additional draws on credit lines;\n(vii) defaults by consumers or corporate      \nclients on loans; and (viii) greater          \nchallenges in valuing derivative positions and\nassociated collateral, leading to significant \nincreases in collateral calls and valuation   \ndisputes. The effects of the COVID-19pandemic \non economic and market conditions have in the \npast and may in the future also increase      \ndemands on our liquidity as we meet client    \nneeds. Likewise, these adverse developments   \nhave in the past and may in the future affect \nour capital and leverage ratios. We suspended \nrepurchases of our common stock during the    \nfirst quarter of 2020 and, consistent with the\nFRB\u2019s requirement for all large BHCs, extended\nthis suspension through the fourth quarter of \n2020 enabling us to deploy more capital and   \nliquidity to meet the needs of our clients.   \nThe effects of the COVID-19pandemic and FRB   \nrequirements have limited and in the future   \nmay further limit capital distributions.      \nGovernmental authorities worldwide have taken \nincreased measures to stabilize the markets   \nand support economic growth. The continued    \nsuccess of these measures is unknown and they \nmay not be sufficient to address future market\ndislocations or avert severe and prolonged    \nreductions in economic activity. We also face \nan increased risk of client disputes,         \nlitigation and governmental and regulatory    \nscrutiny as a result of the effects of the    \nCOVID-19pandemic on economic and market       \nconditions.                                   \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    35  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe length of the pandemic and the efficacy of\nthe extraordinary measures that have been put \nin place to address it are unknown. Until the \npandemic subsides, we may experience draws on \nlines of credit, reduced activity levels in   \ninvestment banking, reduced revenues in our   \nasset management and wealth management        \nbusinesses and increased client defaults,     \nincluding defaults in unsecured loans. Even   \nafter the pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy,\nas well as most other major economies, may    \ncontinue to experience a recession, and we    \nanticipate our businesses would be materially \nand adversely affected by a prolonged         \nrecession in the U.S. and other major markets.\nOur strategy with respect to Brexit may not be\neffective. On January 31, 2020, the U.K. left \nthe E.U., and, on December 31, 2020, the      \ntransition period under the withdrawal        \nagreement between the U.K. and the E.U. ended.\nAs discussed in \u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation\u201d in    \nPart I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K,we have      \nexperienced considerable change in the        \nregulatory framework that governs transactions\nand business undertaken by our U.K.           \nsubsidiaries in the E.U. The U.K. has adopted \nE.U. financial services legislation that was  \nin effect on December 31, 2020, which means   \nthat the U.K. financial services regime will  \nremain substantially the same as under E.U.   \nfinancial services legislation. However, in   \nthe future the U.K. may diverge from E.U.     \nlegislation and may decide not to adopt rules \nthat correspond to E.U. legislation not       \nalready operative in the U.K. As a result, we \nface numerous risks that could adversely      \naffect how we conduct our businesses or our   \nprofitability and liquidity. Certain of our   \nprincipal subsidiaries, including GSI, GSIB   \nand GSAMI, are incorporated and headquartered \nin the U.K. During the transition period, they\nbenefitted from non-discriminatoryaccess to   \nE.U. clients and infrastructure based on E.U. \ntreaties and E.U. legislation, including      \narrangements for cross-border \u201cpassporting\u201d   \nand the establishment of E.U. branches.       \nEffective December 31, 2020, and              \nnotwithstanding the Trade and Cooperation     \nAgreement between the E.U. and U.K. reached at\nthe end of 2020, firms established in the     \nU.K., including our U.K. subsidiaries, have   \nlost their pan-E.U.\u201cpassports\u201d and are        \ngenerally treated as any other entities in    \ncountries outside the E.U. whose access to the\nE.U. is governed by E.U. and national law. As \nnecessary, our German bank subsidiary, GSBE,  \nwill act as our main operating subsidiary in  \nthe E.U. and has assumed certain functions    \nthat can no longer be efficiently and         \neffectively performed by our U.K. operating   \nsubsidiaries, including GSI, GSIB and GSAMI.  \nImplementing this strategy could materially   \nadversely affect the manner in which we       \noperate certain businesses in Europe, require \nus to restructure certain of our operations   \nand expose us to higher operational,          \nregulatory and compliance costs, higher       \nsubsidiary-level capital and liquidity        \nrequirements, additional restrictions on      \nintercompany transactions, and new            \nrestrictions on the ability of our            \nsubsidiaries to share personal data, including\nclient data, all of which could adversely     \naffect our liquidity and profitability. In    \naddition, as we increase our operations in    \njurisdictions with higher tax rates, our tax  \nrate will increase. We have strengthened the  \ncapabilities of our operating subsidiaries in \nE.U. countries and other member states of the \nAgreement on the European Economic Area,      \nparticularly GSBE, and have moved certain     \nactivities there. Although we have invested   \nsignificant resources to plan for and address \nBrexit, there can be no assurance that we will\nbe able to successfully execute our strategy. \nIn addition, even if we are able to           \nsuccessfully execute our strategy, we face the\nrisk that Brexit could have a                 \ndisproportionately adverse effect on our E.U  \noperations compared to some of our competitors\nwho have more extensive pre-existingoperations\nin the E.U. outside of the U.K. Certain of our\nbusinesses, our funding instruments and       \nfinancial products may be adversely affected  \nby changes in or the discontinuance of        \nInterbank Offered Rates (IBORs), in particular\nLIBOR. The administrator of LIBOR has proposed\nto extend publication of the most commonly    \nused U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings to June 30,   \n2023 and to cease publishing other LIBOR      \nsettings on December 31, 2021. The U.S.       \nfederal banking agencies have issued guidance \nstrongly encouraging banking organizations to \ncease using the U.S. Dollar LIBOR as a        \nreference rate in new contracts as soon as    \npracticable and in any event by December 31,  \n2021. It is not possible to know whether LIBOR\nwill continue to be viewed as an acceptable   \nmarket benchmark, what rate or rates may      \nbecome accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what\nthe effect of any such changes in views or    \nalternatives may have on the financial markets\nfor LIBOR-linked financial instruments.       \nSimilar developments have occurred with       \nrespect to other IBORs.                       \n                                      \n  36    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nUncertainty regarding IBORs and the taking of \ndiscretionary actions or negotiation of       \nfallback provisions could result in pricing   \nvolatility, loss of market share in certain   \nproducts, adverse tax or accounting impacts,  \ncompliance, legal and operational costs and   \nrisks associated with client disclosures, as  \nwell as systems disruption, model disruption  \nand other business continuity issues. In      \naddition, uncertainty relating to IBORs could \nresult in increased capital requirements for  \nus given potential low transaction volumes, a \nlack of liquidity or limited observability for\nexposures linked to IBORs or any emerging     \nsuccessor rates and operational incidents     \nassociated with changes in and the            \ndiscontinuance of IBORs. The language in our  \ncontracts and financial instruments that      \ndefine IBORs, in particular LIBOR, have       \ndeveloped over time and have various events   \nthat trigger when a successor rate to the     \ndesignated rate would be selected. If a       \ntrigger is satisfied, contracts and financial \ninstruments often give the calculation agent  \n(which may be us) discretion over the         \nsuccessor rate or benchmark to be selected. As\na result, there is considerable uncertainty as\nto how the financial services industry will   \naddress the discontinuance of designated rates\nin contracts and financial instruments or such\ndesignated rates ceasing to be acceptable     \nreference rates. This uncertainty could       \nultimately result in client disputes and      \nlitigation surrounding the proper             \ninterpretation of our IBOR-based contracts and\nfinancial instruments. Although we have       \nadhered to the ISDA IBOR Fallbacks Protocol,  \nthe protocol is applicable to derivatives when\nboth parties adhere to the protocol or        \notherwise agree for it to apply to their      \nderivatives. Further, the discontinuation of  \nan IBOR, changes in an IBOR or changes in     \nmarket acceptance of any IBOR as a reference  \nrate may also adversely affect the yield on   \nloans or securities held by us, amounts paid  \non securities we have issued, amounts received\nand paid on derivative instruments we have    \nentered into, the value of such loans,        \nsecurities or derivative instruments, the     \ntrading market for securities, the terms of   \nnew loans being made using different or       \nmodified reference rates, our ability to      \neffectively use derivative instruments to     \nmanage risk, or the availability or cost of   \nour floating-rate funding and our exposure to \nfluctuations in interest rates. Certain of our\nbusinesses and our funding instruments may be \nadversely affected by changes in other        \nreference rates, currencies, indexes, baskets \nor ETFs to which products we offer or funding \nthat we raise are linked. Many of the products\nthat we own or that we offer, such as         \nstructured notes, warrants, swaps or security-\nbased swaps, pay interest or determine the    \nprincipal amount to be paid at maturity or in \nthe event of default by reference to rates or \nby reference to an index, currency, basket,   \nETF or other financial metric (the underlier).\nIn the event that the composition of the      \nunderlier is significantly changed, by        \nreference to rules governing such underlier or\notherwise, the underlier ceases to exist (for \nexample, in the event that a country withdraws\nfrom the Euro or links its currency to or     \ndelinks its currency from another currency or \nbenchmark, an index or ETF sponsor materially \nalters the composition of an index or ETF, or \nstocks in a basket are delisted or become     \nimpermissible to be included in the index or  \nETF) or the underlier ceases to be recognized \nas an acceptable market benchmark, we may     \nexperience adverse effects consistent with    \nthose described above for IBORs. We face      \nenhanced risks as new business initiatives and\nacquisitions lead us to engage in new         \nactivities, operate in new locations, transact\nwith a broader array of clients and           \ncounterparties and expose us to new asset     \nclasses and new markets. A number of our      \nrecent and planned business initiatives and   \nexpansions of existing businesses, including  \nthrough acquisitions and partnership          \narrangements, may bring us into contact,      \ndirectly or indirectly, with individuals and  \nentities that are not within our traditional  \nclient and counterparty base, expose us to new\nasset classes and new markets, and present us \nwith integration challenges. For example, we  \ncontinue to transact business and invest in   \nnew regions, including a wide range of        \nemerging and growth markets, and we expect    \nthis trend to continue. Various emerging and  \ngrowth market countries have experienced      \nsevere economic and financial disruptions,    \nincluding significant devaluations of their   \ncurrencies, defaults or threatened defaults on\nsovereign debt, capital and currency exchange \ncontrols, and low or negative growth rates in \ntheir economies. The possible effects of any  \nof these conditions include an adverse impact \non our businesses and increased volatility in \nfinancial markets generally. Furthermore, in a\nnumber of our businesses, including where we  \nmake markets, invest and lend, we own         \ninterests in, or otherwise become affiliated  \nwith the ownership and operation of, public   \nservices, such as airports, toll roads and    \nshipping ports, as well as physical           \ncommodities and commodities infrastructure    \ncomponents, both within and outside the U.S.  \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    37  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe have increased and intend to further       \nincrease our consumer-oriented deposit-taking \nand lending activities. For example, during   \n2019, we started to issue credit cards to     \nconsumers. To the extent we engage in those   \nand other consumer-oriented activities, we    \nhave faced, and would continue to face,       \nadditional compliance, legal and regulatory   \nrisk, increased reputational risk and         \nincreased operational risk due to, among other\nthings, higher transaction volumes and        \nsignificantly increased retention and         \ntransmission of consumer and client           \ninformation. We are also subject to additional\nlegal requirements, including with respect to \nsuitability and consumer protection (for      \nexample, Regulation Best Interest, fair       \nlending laws and regulations and privacy laws \nand regulations). Further, identity fraud may \nincrease and credit reporting practices may   \nchange in a manner that makes it more         \ndifficult for financial institutions, such as \nus, to evaluate the creditworthiness of       \nconsumers. We have increased and intend to    \nfurther increase our transaction banking      \nactivities. As a result, we expect to face    \nadditional compliance, legal and regulatory   \nrisk, including with respect to know-your-    \ncustomer, anti-money laundering and reporting \nrequirements and prohibitions on transfers of \nproperty belonging to countries, entities and \nindividuals subject to sanctions by U.S. or   \nother governmental authorities. New business  \ninitiatives expose us to new and enhanced     \nrisks, including risks associated with dealing\nwith governmental entities, reputational      \nconcerns arising from dealing with different  \ntypes of clients, business partners,          \ncounterparties and investors, greater         \nregulatory scrutiny of these activities,      \nincreased credit-related, market, sovereign   \nand operational risks, risks arising from     \naccidents or acts of terrorism, and           \nreputational concerns with the manner in which\ncertain assets are being operated or held or  \nin which we interact with these clients,      \nbusiness partners, counterparties and         \ninvestors. Legal, regulatory and reputational \nrisks may also exist in connection with       \nactivities and transactions involving new     \nproducts or markets where there is regulatory \nuncertainty or where there are different or   \nconflicting regulations depending on the      \nregulator or the jurisdiction involved,       \nparticularly where transactions in such       \nproducts may involve multiple jurisdictions.  \nWe have developed and pursued new business and\nstrategic initiatives, and expect to continue \nto do so. If and to the extent we are unable  \nto successfully execute those initiatives, we \nmay incur unanticipated costs and losses, and \nface other adverse consequences, such as      \nnegative reputational effects. In addition,   \nthe actual effects of pursuing those          \ninitiatives may differ, possibly materially,  \nfrom the benefits that we expect to realize   \nfrom them, such as generating additional      \nrevenues, achieving expense savings, reducing \noperational risk exposures or using capital   \nand funding more efficiently. Engaging in new \nactivities exposes us to a variety of risks,  \nincluding that we may be unable to            \nsuccessfully develop new, competitive,        \nefficient and effective systems and processes,\nand hire and retain the necessary personnel.  \nDue to our lack of historical experience with \nunsecured retail lending, our loan loss       \nassumptions may prove to be incorrect and we  \nmay incur losses significantly above those    \nwhich we originally anticipated in entering   \nthe business. In recent years, we have        \ninvested, and may continue to invest, more in \nbusinesses that we expect will generate a     \nhigher level of more consistent revenues. In  \norder to develop and be able to offer consumer\nfinancial products that compete effectively,  \nwe have made and expect to continue to make   \nsignificant investments in technology and     \nhuman capital resources in connection with our\nconsumer-oriented activities. Such investments\nmay not be successful or have returns similar \nto our other businesses. Operational A failure\nin our operational systems or infrastructure, \nor those of third parties, as well as human   \nerror, malfeasance or other misconduct, could \nimpair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, \nresult in the disclosure of confidential      \ninformation, damage our reputation and cause  \nlosses. Our businesses are highly dependent on\nour ability to process and monitor, on a daily\nbasis, a very large number of transactions,   \nmany of which are highly complex and occur at \nhigh volumes and frequencies, across numerous \nand diverse markets in many currencies. These \ntransactions, as well as the information      \ntechnology services we provide to clients,    \noften must adhere to client-specific          \nguidelines, as well as legal and regulatory   \nstandards.                                    \n                                      \n  38    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMany rules and regulations worldwide govern   \nour obligations to execute transactions and   \nreport such transactions and other information\nto regulators, exchanges and investors.       \nCompliance with these legal and reporting     \nrequirements can be challenging, and we have  \nbeen and may in the future be subject to      \nregulatory fines and penalties for failing to \nfollow these rules or to report timely,       \naccurate and complete information in          \naccordance with these rules. As such          \nrequirements expand, compliance with these    \nrules and regulations has become more         \nchallenging. As our client base, including    \nthrough our consumer businesses, and our      \ngeographical reach expand and the volume,     \nspeed, frequency and complexity of            \ntransactions, especially electronic           \ntransactions (as well as the requirements to  \nreport such transactions on a real-time basis \nto clients, regulators and exchanges)         \nincrease, developing and maintaining our      \noperational systems and infrastructure becomes\nmore challenging, and the risk of systems or  \nhuman error in connection with such           \ntransactions increases, as well as the        \npotential consequences of such errors due to  \nthe speed and volume of transactions involved \nand the potential difficulty associated with  \ndiscovering errors quickly enough to limit the\nresulting consequences. Such risks are        \nexacerbated in times of increased volatility. \nAs with other similarly situated institutions,\nwe utilize credit underwriting models in      \nconnection with our businesses, including our \nconsumer-oriented activities. Allegations,    \nwhether or not accurate, that the ultimate    \nunderwriting decisions do not treat consumers \nor clients fairly, or comply with the         \napplicable law or regulation, can result in   \nnegative publicity, reputational damage and   \ngovernmental and regulatory scrutiny. Our     \nfinancial, accounting, data processing or     \nother operational systems and facilities may  \nfail to operate properly or become disabled as\na result of events that are wholly or         \npartially beyond our control, such as a spike \nin transaction volume, adversely affecting our\nability to process these transactions or      \nprovide these services. We must continuously  \nupdate these systems to support our operations\nand growth and to respond to changes in       \nregulations and markets, and invest heavily in\nsystemic controls and training to pursue our  \nobjective of ensuring that such transactions  \ndo not violate applicable rules and           \nregulations or, due to errors in processing   \nsuch transactions, adversely affect markets,  \nour clients and counterparties or us.         \nEnhancements and updates to systems, as well  \nas the requisite training, including in       \nconnection with the integration of new        \nbusinesses, entail significant costs and      \ncreate risks associated with implementing new \nsystems and integrating them with existing    \nones. The use of computing devices and phones \nis critical to the work done by our employees \nand the operation of our systems and          \nbusinesses and those of our clients and our   \nthird-party service providers and vendors.    \nTheir importance has continued to increase, in\nparticular in light of work-from-home         \narrangements implemented in response to the   \nCOVID-19pandemic. Computers and computer      \nnetworks are subject to various risks,        \nincluding, among others, cyber attacks,       \ninherent technological defects, system        \nfailures and human error. For example,        \nfundamental security flaws in computer chips  \nfound in many types of these computing devices\nand phones have been reported in the past and \nmay be discovered in the future. Cloud        \ntechnologies are also critical to the         \noperation of our systems and platforms and our\nreliance on cloud technologies is growing.    \nService disruptions may lead to delays in     \naccessing, or the loss of, data that is       \nimportant to our businesses and may hinder our\nclients\u2019 access to our platforms. Addressing  \nthese and similar issues could be costly and  \naffect the performance of these businesses and\nsystems. Operational risks may be incurred in \napplying fixes and there may still be residual\nsecurity risks. Additionally, although the    \nprevalence and scope of applications of       \ndistributed ledger technology and similar     \ntechnologies is growing, the technology is    \nalso nascent and may be vulnerable to cyber   \nattacks or have other inherent weaknesses. We \nmay be, or may become, exposed to risks       \nrelated to distributed ledger technology,     \nincluding through our facilitation of clients\u2019\nactivities involving financial products linked\nto distributed ledger technology, such as     \nblockchain or cryptocurrencies, our           \ninvestments in companies that seek to develop \nplatforms based on distributed ledger         \ntechnology, and the use of distributed ledger \ntechnology by third-party vendors, clients,   \ncounterparties, clearing houses and other     \nfinancial intermediaries. Notwithstanding the \nproliferation of technology and technology-   \nbased risk and control systems, our businesses\nultimately rely on people as our greatest     \nresource, and, from time to time, they make   \nmistakes or engage in violations of applicable\npolicies, laws, rules or procedures that are  \nnot always caught immediately by our          \ntechnological processes or by our controls and\nother procedures, which are intended to       \nprevent and detect such errors or violations. \nThese can include calculation errors, mistakes\nin addressing emails, errors in software or   \nmodel development or implementation, or simple\nerrors in judgment, as well as intentional    \nefforts to ignore or circumvent applicable    \npolicies, laws, rules or procedures. Human    \nerrors, malfeasance and other misconduct,     \nincluding the intentional misuse of client    \ninformation in connection with insider trading\nor for other purposes, even if promptly       \ndiscovered and remediated, can result in      \nreputational damage and material losses and   \nliabilities for us.                           \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    39  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn addition, we face the risk of operational  \nfailure or significant operational delay,     \ntermination or capacity constraints of any of \nthe clearing agents, exchanges, clearing      \nhouses or other financial intermediaries we   \nuse to facilitate our securities and          \nderivatives transactions, and as our          \ninterconnectivity with our clients grows, we  \nincreasingly face the risk of operational     \nfailure or significant operational delay with \nrespect to our clients\u2019 systems. There has    \nbeen significant consolidation among clearing \nagents, exchanges and clearing houses and an  \nincreasing number of derivative transactions  \nare cleared on exchanges, which has increased \nour exposure to operational failure or        \nsignificant operational delay, termination or \ncapacity constraints of the particular        \nfinancial intermediaries that we use and could\naffect our ability to find adequate and cost- \neffective alternatives in the event of any    \nsuch failure, delay, termination or           \nconstraint. Industry consolidation, whether   \namong market participants or financial        \nintermediaries, increases the risk of         \noperational failure or significant operational\ndelay as disparate complex systems need to be \nintegrated, often on an accelerated basis. The\ninterconnectivity of multiple financial       \ninstitutions with central agents, exchanges   \nand clearing houses, and the increased        \ncentrality of these entities, increases the   \nrisk that an operational failure at one       \ninstitution or entity may cause an industry-  \nwide operational failure that could materially\nimpact our ability to conduct business.       \nInterconnectivity of financial institutions   \nwith other companies through, among other     \nthings, application programming interfaces or \nAPIs presents similar risks. Any such failure,\ntermination or constraint could adversely     \naffect our ability to effect transactions,    \nservice our clients, manage our exposure to   \nrisk or expand our businesses or result in    \nfinancial loss or liability to our clients,   \nimpairment of our liquidity, disruption of our\nbusinesses, regulatory intervention or        \nreputational damage. Despite our resiliency   \nplans and facilities, our ability to conduct  \nbusiness may be adversely impacted by a       \ndisruption in the infrastructure that supports\nour businesses and the communities where we   \nare located. This may include a disruption    \ninvolving electrical, satellite, undersea     \ncable or other communications, internet,      \ntransportation or other facilities used by us,\nour employees or third parties with which we  \nconduct business, including cloud service     \nproviders. These disruptions may occur as a   \nresult of events that affect only our         \nbuildings or systems or those of such third   \nparties, or as a result of events with a      \nbroader impact globally, regionally or in the \ncities where those buildings or systems are   \nlocated, including, but not limited to,       \nnatural disasters, war, civil unrest,         \nterrorism, economic or political developments,\npandemics and weather events. In addition,    \nalthough we seek to diversify our third-party \nvendors to increase our resiliency, we are    \nalso exposed to the risk that a disruption or \nother information technology event at a common\nservice provider to our vendors could impede  \ntheir ability to provide products or services \nto us, including in connection with our new   \nbusiness initiatives. We may not be able to   \neffectively monitor or mitigate operational   \nrisks relating to our vendors\u2019 use of common  \nservice providers. Aside from work-from-home  \narrangements during the COVID-19pandemic,     \nnearly all of our employees in our primary    \nlocations, including the New York metropolitan\narea, London, Bengaluru, Hong Kong, Tokyo and \nSalt Lake City, work in close proximity to one\nanother, in one or more buildings.            \nNotwithstanding our efforts to maintain       \nbusiness continuity, given that our           \nheadquarters and the largest concentration of \nour employees are in the New York metropolitan\narea, and our two principal office buildings  \nin the New York area both are located on the  \nwaterfront of the Hudson River, depending on  \nthe intensity and longevity of the event, a   \ncatastrophic event impacting our New York     \nmetropolitan area offices, including a        \nterrorist attack, extreme weather event or    \nother hostile or catastrophic event, could    \nnegatively affect our business. If a          \ndisruption occurs in one location and our     \nemployees in that location are unable to      \noccupy our offices or communicate with or     \ntravel to other locations or successfully work\nremotely, our ability to service and interact \nwith our clients may suffer, and we may not be\nable to successfully implement contingency    \nplans that depend on communication, work-from-\nhome arrangements or travel. A failure to     \nprotect our computer systems, networks and    \ninformation, and our clients\u2019 information,    \nagainst cyber attacks and similar threats     \ncould impair our ability to conduct our       \nbusinesses, result in the disclosure, theft or\ndestruction of confidential information,      \ndamage our reputation and cause losses. Our   \noperations rely on the secure processing,     \nstorage and transmission of confidential and  \nother information in our computer systems and \nnetworks and those of our vendors.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber\nattacks, including denial-of-serviceattacks,  \nand must continuously monitor and develop our \nsystems to protect the integrity and          \nfunctionality of our technology infrastructure\nand access to and the security of our data. We\nmay face an increasing number of attempted    \ncyber attacks as we expand our mobile- and    \nother internet-based products and services, as\nwell as our usage of mobile and cloud         \ntechnologies, and as we provide more of these \nservices to a greater number of individual    \nconsumers. The increasing migration of our    \ncommunication from devices we provide to      \nemployee-owned devices presents additional    \nrisks of cyber attacks, as do work-from-home  \narrangements such as those implemented in     \nresponse to the COVID-19pandemic. In addition,\ndue to our interconnectivity with third-party \nvendors (and their respective service         \nproviders), central agents, exchanges,        \nclearing houses and other financial           \ninstitutions, we could be adversely impacted  \nif any of them is subject to a successful     \ncyber attack or other information security    \nevent. These impacts could include the loss of\naccess to information or services from the    \nthird party subject to the cyber attack or    \nother information security event, which could,\nin turn, interrupt certain of our businesses. \nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of\nour systems and information, we may not be    \nable to anticipate, detect or implement       \neffective preventive measures against all     \ncyber threats, especially because the         \ntechniques used are increasingly              \nsophisticated, change frequently and are often\nnot recognized until launched. Cyber attacks  \ncan originate from a variety of sources,      \nincluding third parties who are affiliated    \nwith or sponsored by foreign governments or   \nare involved with organized crime or terrorist\norganizations. Third parties may also attempt \nto place individuals in our offices or induce \nemployees, clients or other users of our      \nsystems to disclose sensitive information or  \nprovide access to our data or that of our     \nclients, and these types of risks may be      \ndifficult to detect or prevent. Although we   \ntake protective measures proactively and      \nendeavor to modify them as circumstances      \nwarrant, our computer systems, software and   \nnetworks may be vulnerable to unauthorized    \naccess, misuse, computer viruses or other     \nmalicious code, cyber attacks on our vendors  \nand other events that could have a security   \nimpact. Due to the complexity and             \ninterconnectedness of our systems, the process\nof enhancing our protective measures can      \nitself create a risk of systems disruptions   \nand security issues. In addition, protective  \nmeasures that we employ to compartmentalize   \nour data may reduce our visibility into, and  \nadversely affect our ability to respond to,   \ncyber threats and issues with our systems. If \none or more of such events occur, this        \npotentially could jeopardize our or our       \nclients\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential and  \nother information processed, stored in, or    \ntransmitted through our computer systems and  \nnetworks, or otherwise cause interruptions or \nmalfunctions in our operations or those of our\nclients, counterparties or third parties,     \nwhich could impact their ability to transact  \nwith us or otherwise result in legal or       \nregulatory action, significant losses or      \nreputational damage. In addition, such an     \nevent could persist for an extended period of \ntime before being detected, and, following    \ndetection, it could take considerable time for\nus to obtain full and reliable information    \nabout the extent, amount and type of          \ninformation compromised. During the course of \nan investigation, we may not know the full    \nimpact of the event and how to remediate it,  \nand actions, decisions and mistakes that are  \ntaken or made may further increase the        \nnegative effects of the event on our business,\nresults of operations and reputation. We have \nexpended, and expect to continue to expend,   \nsignificant resources on an ongoing basis to  \nmodify our protective measures and to         \ninvestigate and remediate vulnerabilities or  \nother exposures, but these measures may be    \nineffective and we may be subject to legal or \nregulatory action, as well as financial losses\nthat are either not insured against or not    \nfully covered through any insurance maintained\nby us. Our clients\u2019 confidential information  \nmay also be at risk from the compromise of    \nclients\u2019 personal electronic devices or as a  \nresult of a data security breach at an        \nunrelated company. Losses due to unauthorized \naccount activity could harm our reputation and\nmay have adverse effects on our business,     \nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nThe increased use of mobile and cloud         \ntechnologies can heighten these and other     \noperational risks, as can work-from-home      \narrangements. Certain aspects of the security \nof such technologies are unpredictable or     \nbeyond our control, and the failure by mobile \ntechnology and cloud service providers to     \nadequately safeguard their systems and prevent\ncyber attacks could disrupt our operations and\nresult in misappropriation, corruption or loss\nof confidential and other information. In     \naddition, there is a risk that encryption and \nother protective measures, despite their      \nsophistication, may be defeated, particularly \nto the extent that new computing technologies \nvastly increase the speed and computing power \navailable.                                    \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    41  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe routinely transmit and receive personal,   \nconfidential and proprietary information by   \nemail and other electronic means. We have     \ndiscussed and worked with clients, vendors,   \nservice providers, counterparties and other   \nthird parties to develop secure transmission  \ncapabilities and protect against cyber        \nattacks, but we do not have, and may be unable\nto put in place, secure capabilities with all \nof our clients, vendors, service providers,   \ncounterparties and other third parties and we \nmay not be able to ensure that these third    \nparties have appropriate controls in place to \nprotect the confidentiality of the            \ninformation. An interception, misuse or       \nmishandling of personal, confidential or      \nproprietary information being sent to or      \nreceived from a client, vendor, service       \nprovider, counterparty or other third party   \ncould result in legal liability, regulatory   \naction and reputational harm. We may incur    \nlosses as a result of ineffective risk        \nmanagement processes and strategies. We seek  \nto monitor and control our risk exposure      \nthrough a risk and control framework          \nencompassing a variety of separate but        \ncomplementary financial, credit, operational, \ncompliance and legal reporting systems,       \ninternal controls, management review processes\nand other mechanisms. Our risk management     \nprocess seeks to balance our ability to profit\nfrom market-making, investing or lending      \npositions, and underwriting activities, with  \nour exposure to potential losses. While we    \nemploy a broad and diversified set of risk    \nmonitoring and risk mitigation techniques,    \nthose techniques and the judgments that       \naccompany their application cannot anticipate \nevery economic and financial outcome or the   \nspecifics and timing of such outcomes. Thus,  \nin the course of our activities, we have      \nincurred and may in the future incur losses.  \nMarket conditions in recent years have        \ninvolved unprecedented dislocations and       \nhighlight the limitations inherent in using   \nhistorical data to manage risk. The models    \nthat we use to assess and control our risk    \nexposures reflect assumptions about the       \ndegrees of correlation or lack thereof among  \nprices of various asset classes or other      \nmarket indicators. In times of market stress  \nor other unforeseen circumstances, previously \nuncorrelated indicators may become correlated,\nor conversely previously correlated indicators\nmay move in different directions. These types \nof market movements have at times limited the \neffectiveness of our hedging strategies and   \nhave caused us to incur significant losses,   \nand they may do so in the future. These       \nchanges in correlation have been and may in   \nthe future be exacerbated where other market  \nparticipants are using risk or trading models \nwith assumptions or algorithms that are       \nsimilar to ours. In these and other cases, it \nmay be difficult to reduce our risk positions \ndue to the activity of other market           \nparticipants or widespread market             \ndislocations, including circumstances where   \nasset values are declining significantly or no\nmarket exists for certain assets. In addition,\nthe use of models in connection with risk     \nmanagement and numerous other critical        \nactivities presents risks that such models may\nbe ineffective, either because of poor design,\nineffective testing, or improper or flawed    \ninputs, as well as unpermitted access to such \nmodels resulting in unapproved or malicious   \nchanges to the model or its inputs. To the    \nextent that we have positions through our     \nmarket-making or origination activities or we \nmake investments directly through our         \ninvesting activities, including private       \nequity, that do not have an established liquid\ntrading market or are otherwise subject to    \nrestrictions on sale or hedging, we may not be\nable to reduce our positions and therefore    \nreduce our risk associated with those         \npositions. In addition, to the extent         \npermitted by applicable law and regulation, we\ninvest our own capital in private equity,     \ncredit, real estate and hedge funds that we   \nmanage and limitations on our ability to      \nwithdraw some or all of our investments in    \nthese funds, whether for legal, reputational  \nor other reasons, may make it more difficult  \nfor us to control the risk exposures relating \nto these investments. Prudent risk management,\nas well as regulatory restrictions, may cause \nus to limit our exposure to counterparties,   \ngeographic areas or markets, which may limit  \nour business opportunities and increase the   \ncost of our funding or hedging activities. As \nwe have expanded and intend to continue to    \nexpand the product and geographic scope of our\nofferings of credit products to consumers, we \nare presented with different credit risks and \nmust expand and adapt our credit risk         \nmonitoring and mitigation activities to       \naccount for these business activities. A      \nfailure to adequately assess and control such \nrisk exposures could result in losses to us.  \nFor further information about our risk        \nmanagement policies and procedures, see       \n\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of      \nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations \n\u2014 Risk Management\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this \nForm 10-K.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nClimate change concerns could disrupt our     \nbusinesses, adversely affect client activity  \nlevels, adversely affect the creditworthiness \nof our counterparties and damage our          \nreputation. Climate change may cause extreme  \nweather events that disrupt operations at one \nor more of our primary locations, which may   \nnegatively affect our ability to service and  \ninteract with our clients, and also may       \nadversely affect the value of our investments,\nincluding our real estate investments. Climate\nchange may also have a negative impact on the \nfinancial condition of our clients, which may \ndecrease revenues from those clients and      \nincrease the credit risk associated with loans\nand other credit exposures to those clients.  \nAdditionally, our reputation and client       \nrelationships may be damaged as a result of   \nour involvement, or our clients\u2019 involvement, \nin certain industries or projects associated  \nwith causing or exacerbating climate change,  \nas well as any decisions we make to continue  \nto conduct or change our activities in        \nresponse to considerations relating to climate\nchange. New regulations or guidance relating  \nto climate change, as well as the perspectives\nof shareholders, employees and other          \nstakeholders regarding climate change, may    \naffect whether and on what terms and          \nconditions we engage in certain activities or \noffer certain products. Legal and Regulatory  \nOur businesses and those of our clients are   \nsubject to extensive and pervasive regulation \naround the world. As a participant in the     \nfinancial services industry and a systemically\nimportant financial institution, we are       \nsubject to extensive regulation in            \njurisdictions around the world. We face the   \nrisk of significant intervention by law       \nenforcement, regulatory and taxing            \nauthorities, as well as private litigation, in\nall jurisdictions in which we conduct our     \nbusinesses. In many cases, our activities have\nbeen and may continue to be subject to        \noverlapping and divergent regulation in       \ndifferent jurisdictions. Among other things,  \nas a result of law enforcement authorities,   \nregulators or private parties challenging our \ncompliance with existing laws and regulations,\nwe or our employees have been, and could be,  \nfined, criminally charged or sanctioned;      \nprohibited from engaging in some of our       \nbusiness activities; subjected to limitations \nor conditions on our business activities,     \nincluding higher capital requirements; or     \nsubjected to new or substantially higher taxes\nor other governmental charges in connection   \nwith the conduct of our businesses or with    \nrespect to our employees. These limitations or\nconditions may limit our business activities  \nand negatively impact our profitability. In   \naddition to the impact on the scope and       \nprofitability of our business activities, day-\nto-daycompliance with existing laws and       \nregulations has involved and will continue to \ninvolve significant amounts of time, including\nthat of our senior leaders and that of a large\nnumber of dedicated compliance and other      \nreporting and operational personnel, all of   \nwhich may negatively impact our profitability.\nOur revenues and profitability and those of   \nour competitors have been and will continue to\nbe impacted by requirements relating to       \ncapital, additional loss-absorbing capacity,  \nleverage, minimum liquidity and long-term     \nfunding levels, requirements related to       \nresolution and recovery planning, derivatives \nclearing and margin rules and levels of       \nregulatory oversight, as well as limitations  \non which and, if permitted, how certain       \nbusiness activities may be carried out by     \nfinancial institutions. If there are new laws \nor regulations or changes in the enforcement  \nof existing laws or regulations applicable to \nour businesses or those of our clients,       \nincluding capital, liquidity, leverage, long- \nterm debt, total loss-absorbing capacity and  \nmargin requirements, restrictions on leveraged\nlending or other business practices, reporting\nrequirements, requirements relating to        \nrecovery and resolution planning, tax burdens \nand compensation restrictions, that are       \nimposed on a limited subset of financial      \ninstitutions (whether based on size, method of\nfunding, activities, geography or other       \ncriteria), compliance with these new laws or  \nregulations, or changes in the enforcement of \nexisting laws or regulations, could adversely \naffect our ability to compete effectively with\nother institutions that are not affected in   \nthe same way. In addition, regulation imposed \non financial institutions or market           \nparticipants generally, such as taxes on stock\ntransfers and other financial transactions,   \ncould adversely impact levels of market       \nactivity more broadly, and thus impact our    \nbusinesses. Changes to laws or regulations,   \nsuch as tax laws, could also have a           \ndisproportionate impact on us, based on the   \nway those laws or regulations are applied to  \nfinancial services and financial firms or due \nto our corporate structure. For example,      \nduring the recent presidential election, the  \nnew U.S. administration offered tax policy    \nideas that if enacted would, among other      \nthings, increase the corporate tax rate and   \nthe U.S. tax rate on Global Intangible Low    \nTaxed Income (GILTI). Any increase in the     \ncorporate tax rate or the U.S. tax on GILTI   \nwould increase our effective tax rate and     \nprovision for taxes, possibly materially.     \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    43  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThese developments could impact our           \nprofitability in the affected jurisdictions,  \nor even make it uneconomic for us to continue \nto conduct all or certain of our businesses in\nthose jurisdictions, or could cause us to     \nincur significant costs associated with       \nchanging our business practices, restructuring\nour businesses, moving all or certain of our  \nbusinesses and our employees to other         \nlocations or complying with applicable capital\nrequirements, including reducing dividends or \nshare repurchases, liquidating assets or      \nraising capital in a manner that adversely    \nincreases our funding costs or otherwise      \nadversely affects our shareholders and        \ncreditors. U.S. and non-U.S.regulatory        \ndevelopments, in particular the Dodd-Frank Act\nand Basel III, have significantly altered the \nregulatory framework within which we operate  \nand have adversely affected and may in the    \nfuture adversely affect our profitability.    \nAmong the aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act that  \nhave affected or may in the future affect our \nbusinesses are: increased capital, liquidity  \nand reporting requirements; limitations on    \nactivities in which we may engage; increased  \nregulation of and restrictions on OTC         \nderivatives markets and transactions;         \nlimitations on incentive compensation;        \nlimitations on affiliate transactions;        \nrequirements to reorganize or limit activities\nin connection with recovery and resolution    \nplanning; increased deposit insurance         \nassessments; and increased standards of care  \nfor broker-dealers and investment advisers in \ndealing with clients. The implementation of   \nhigher capital requirements, more stringent   \nrequirements relating to liquidity, long-term \ndebt and total loss-absorbing capacity and the\nprohibition on proprietary trading and the    \nsponsorship of, or investment in, covered     \nfunds by the Volcker Rule may continue to     \nadversely affect our profitability and        \ncompetitive position, particularly if these   \nrequirements do not apply equally to our      \ncompetitors or are not implemented uniformly  \nacross jurisdictions. We may also become      \nsubject to higher and more stringent capital  \nand other regulatory requirements as a result \nof the implementation of Basel Committee      \nstandards, including those published in       \nDecember 2017. As described in \u201cBusiness \u2014    \nRegulation \u2014 Banking Supervision and          \nRegulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Form    \n10-K,the SCB has replaced the capital         \nconservation buffer under the Standardized    \nCapital Rules and resulted in higher          \nStandardized capital ratio requirements.      \nFailure to comply with these requirements     \ncould limit our ability to, among other       \nthings, repurchase shares, pay dividends and  \nmake certain discretionary compensation       \npayments. In addition, if, as in 2020, we are \nrequired to resubmit our capital plan, we     \ngenerally may not make capital distributions, \nsuch as share repurchases or dividends,       \nwithout the prior approval of the FRB.        \nDividends and repurchases are also subject to \noversight by the FRB, which can result in     \nlimitations. Limitations on our ability to    \nmake capital distributions could, among other \nthings, prevent us from returning capital to  \nour shareholders and impact our return on     \nequity. Additionally, as a consequence of our \ndesignation as a G-SIB,we are subject to the  \nG-SIBsurcharge. Our G-SIBsurcharge is updated \nannually based on financial data from the     \nprior year. Expansion of our businesses,      \ngrowth in our balance sheet and increased     \nreliance on short-term wholesale funding have \nresulted in increases and in the future may   \nresult in further increases in our            \nG-SIBsurcharge and a corresponding increase in\nour capital requirements. We are also subject \nto laws and regulations, such as the GDPR and \nthe California Consumer Privacy Act, relating \nto the privacy of the information of clients, \nemployees or others, and any failure to comply\nwith these laws and regulations could expose  \nus to liability and/or reputational damage. As\nnew privacy-related laws and regulations are  \nimplemented, the time and resources needed for\nus to comply with such laws and regulations,  \nas well as our potential liability for non-   \ncomplianceand reporting obligations in the    \ncase of data breaches, may significantly      \nincrease. In addition, our businesses are     \nincreasingly subject to laws and regulations  \nrelating to surveillance, encryption and data \non-shoringin the jurisdictions in which we    \noperate. Compliance with these laws and       \nregulations may require us to change our      \npolicies, procedures and technology for       \ninformation security, which could, among other\nthings, make us more vulnerable to cyber      \nattacks and misappropriation, corruption or   \nloss of information or technology.            \n                                      \n  44    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Not only are these regulations       \nextensive, but they involve types of          \nregulations and supervision, as well as       \nregulatory compliance risks, that have not    \nhistorically applied to us. The level of      \nregulatory scrutiny and the scope of          \nregulations affecting financial interactions  \nwith consumers is often much greater than that\nassociated with doing business with           \ninstitutions and high-net-worthindividuals.   \nComplying with these regulations is time-     \nconsuming, costly and presents new and        \nincreased risks. Increasingly, regulators and \ncourts have sought to hold financial          \ninstitutions liable for the misconduct of     \ntheir clients where they have determined that \nthe financial institution should have detected\nthat the client was engaged in wrongdoing,    \neven though the financial institution had no  \ndirect knowledge of the activities engaged in \nby its client. Regulators and courts have also\nincreasingly found liability as a \u201ccontrol    \nperson\u201d for activities of entities in which   \nfinancial institutions or funds controlled by \nfinancial institutions have an investment, but\nwhich they do not actively manage. In         \naddition, regulators and courts continue to   \nseek to establish \u201cfiduciary\u201d obligations to  \ncounterparties to which no such duty had been \nassumed to exist. To the extent that such     \nefforts are successful, the cost of, and      \nliabilities associated with, engaging in      \nbrokerage, clearing, market-making, prime     \nbrokerage, investing and other similar        \nactivities could increase significantly. To   \nthe extent that we have fiduciary obligations \nin connection with acting as a financial      \nadviser or investment adviser or in other     \nroles for individual, institutional, sovereign\nor investment fund clients, any breach, or    \neven an alleged breach, of such obligations   \ncould have materially negative legal,         \nregulatory and reputational consequences. For \ninformation about the extensive regulation to \nwhich our businesses are subject, see         \n\u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of  \nthis Form 10-K. A failure to appropriately    \nidentify and address potential conflicts of   \ninterest could adversely affect our           \nbusinesses. Due to the broad scope of our     \nbusinesses and our client base, we regularly  \naddress potential conflicts of interest,      \nincluding situations where our services to a  \nparticular client or our own investments or   \nother interests conflict, or are perceived to \nconflict, with the interests of that client or\nanother client, as well as situations where   \none or more of our businesses have access to  \nmaterial non-publicinformation that may not be\nshared with our other businesses and          \nsituations where we may be a creditor of an   \nentity with which we also have an advisory or \nother relationship. In addition, our status as\na BHC subjects us to heightened regulation and\nincreased regulatory scrutiny by the FRB with \nrespect to transactions between GS Bank USA   \nand entities that are or could be viewed as   \naffiliates of ours and, under the Volcker     \nRule, transactions between us and covered     \nfunds. We have extensive procedures and       \ncontrols that are designed to identify and    \naddress conflicts of interest, including those\ndesigned to prevent the improper sharing of   \ninformation among our businesses. However,    \nappropriately identifying and dealing with    \nconflicts of interest is complex and          \ndifficult, and our reputation, which is one of\nour most important assets, could be damaged   \nand the willingness of clients to enter into  \ntransactions with us may be adversely affected\nif we fail, or appear to fail, to identify,   \ndisclose and deal appropriately with conflicts\nof interest. In addition, potential or        \nperceived conflicts could give rise to        \nlitigation or regulatory enforcement actions. \nAdditionally, our One Goldman Sachsinitiative \naims to increase collaboration among our      \nbusinesses, which may increase the potential  \nfor actual or perceived conflicts of interest \nand improper information sharing. We may be   \nadversely affected by increased governmental  \nand regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity.\nGovernmental scrutiny from regulators,        \nlegislative bodies and law enforcement        \nagencies with respect to matters relating to  \ncompensation, our business practices, our past\nactions and other matters has increased       \ndramatically. Political and public sentiment  \nregarding financial institutions has in the   \npast and may in the future result in a        \nsignificant amount of adverse press coverage, \nas well as adverse statements or charges by   \nregulators or other government officials.     \nPress coverage and other public statements    \nthat assert some form of wrongdoing           \n(including, in some cases, press coverage and \npublic statements that do not directly involve\nus) often result in some type of investigation\nby regulators, legislators and law enforcement\nofficials or in lawsuits. Responding to these \ninvestigations and lawsuits, regardless of the\nultimate outcome of the proceeding, is time-  \nconsuming and expensive and can divert the    \ntime and effort of our senior management from \nour business. Penalties and fines sought by   \nregulatory authorities have increased         \nsubstantially over the last several years, and\ncertain regulators have been more likely in   \nrecent years to commence enforcement actions  \nor to advance or support legislation targeted \nat the financial services industry. Adverse   \npublicity, governmental scrutiny and legal and\nenforcement proceedings can also have a       \nnegative impact on our reputation and on the  \nmorale and performance of our employees, which\ncould adversely affect our businesses and     \nresults of operations.                        \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    45  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe financial services industry generally and \nour businesses in particular have been subject\nto negative publicity. Our reputation and     \nbusinesses may be adversely affected by       \nnegative publicity or information regarding   \nour businesses and personnel, whether or not  \naccurate or true, that may be posted on social\nmedia or other internet forums or published by\nnews organizations. Postings on these types of\nforums may also adversely impact risk         \npositions of our clients and other parties    \nthat owe us money, securities or other assets \nand increase the chance that they will not    \nperform their obligations to us or reduce the \nrevenues we receive from their use of our     \nservices. The speed and pervasiveness with    \nwhich information can be disseminated through \nthese channels, in particular social media,   \nmay magnify risks relating to negative        \npublicity. Substantial civil or criminal      \nliability or significant regulatory action    \nagainst us could have material adverse        \nfinancial effects or cause us significant     \nreputational harm, which in turn could        \nseriously harm our business prospects. We face\nsignificant legal risks in our businesses, and\nthe volume of claims and amount of damages and\npenalties claimed in litigation and regulatory\nproceedings against financial institutions    \nremain high. See Notes 18 and 27 to the       \nconsolidated financial statements in Part II, \nItem 8 of this Form 10-Kfor information about \ncertain of our legal and regulatory           \nproceedings and investigations. We have seen  \nlegal claims by consumers and clients increase\nin a market downturn and employment-related   \nclaims increase following periods in which we \nhave reduced our headcount. Additionally,     \ngovernmental entities have been plaintiffs and\nare parties in certain of our legal           \nproceedings, and we may face future civil or  \ncriminal actions or claims by the same or     \nother governmental entities, as well as       \nfollow-oncivil litigation that is often       \ncommenced after regulatory settlements.       \nSignificant settlements by several large      \nfinancial institutions, including, in some    \ncases, us, with governmental entities have    \nbeen publicly announced. The trend of large   \nsettlements with governmental entities may    \nadversely affect the outcomes for other       \nfinancial institutions in similar actions,    \nespecially where governmental officials have  \nannounced that the large settlements will be  \nused as the basis or a template for other     \nsettlements. The uncertain regulatory         \nenforcement environment makes it difficult to \nestimate probable losses, which can lead to   \nsubstantial disparities between legal reserves\nand subsequent actual settlements or          \npenalties. Claims of collusion or anti-       \ncompetitive conduct have become more common.  \nCivil cases have been brought against         \nfinancial institutions (including us) alleging\nbid rigging, group boycotts or other anti-    \ncompetitive practices. Antitrust laws         \ngenerally provide for joint and several       \nliability and treble damages. These claims    \nhave resulted in significant settlements in   \nthe past and may do so in the future. We are  \nsubject to laws and regulations worldwide,    \nincluding the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act,  \nrelating to corrupt and illegal payments to,  \nand hiring practices with regard to,          \ngovernment officials and others. Violation of \nthese or similar laws and regulations have in \nthe past resulted in and could in the future  \nresult in significant monetary penalties. Such\nviolations could also result in severe        \nrestrictions on our activities and damage to  \nour reputation. Certain law enforcement       \nauthorities have recently required admissions \nof wrongdoing, and, in some cases, criminal   \npleas, as part of the resolutions of matters  \nbrought against financial institutions or     \ntheir employees. See for example, \u201c1MDB-      \nRelated Matters\u201d in Note 27 to the            \nconsolidated financial statements in Part II, \nItem 8 of this Form 10-K.Any such resolution  \nof a criminal matter involving us or our      \nemployees could lead to increased exposure to \ncivil litigation, could adversely affect our  \nreputation, could result in penalties or      \nlimitations on our ability to conduct our     \nactivities generally or in certain            \ncircumstances and could have other negative   \neffects. Further, as a result of the 1MDB     \nsettlement, we are no longer a \u201cwell-known    \nseasoned issuer,\u201d which could place           \nlimitations on the manner in which we can     \nmarket our securities. In conducting our      \nbusinesses around the world, we are subject to\npolitical, legal, regulatory and other risks  \nthat are inherent in operating in many        \ncountries. In conducting our businesses and   \nsupporting our global operations, we are      \nsubject to risks of possible nationalization, \nexpropriation, price controls, capital        \ncontrols, exchange controls, communications   \nand other content restrictions, and other     \nrestrictive governmental actions. For example,\nsanctions have been imposed by the U.S. and   \nthe E.U. on certain individuals and companies \nin Russia and Venezuela. In many countries,   \nthe laws and regulations applicable to the    \nsecurities and financial services industries  \nand many of the transactions in which we are  \ninvolved are uncertain and evolving, and it   \nmay be difficult for us to determine the exact\nrequirements of local laws in every market. We\nare also subject to the risk that our         \nbusinesses may be subject to divergent laws   \nand regulations across markets and that the   \njurisdictions in which we operate may         \nimplement laws and regulations that directly  \nconflict with those of another jurisdiction.  \nAny determination by local regulators that we \nhave not acted in compliance with the         \napplication of local laws in a particular     \nmarket or our failure to develop effective    \nworking relationships with local regulators   \ncould have a significant and negative effect  \nnot only on our businesses in that market, but\nalso on our reputation generally. Further, in \nsome jurisdictions a failure, or alleged      \nfailure, to comply with laws and regulations  \nhas subjected and may in the future subject us\nand our personnel not only to civil actions,  \nbut also criminal actions and other sanctions.\nWe are also subject to the enhanced risk that \ntransactions we structure might not be legally\nenforceable in all cases.                     \n                                      \n  46    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWhile business and other practices throughout \nthe world differ, our principal entities are  \nsubject in their operations worldwide to rules\nand regulations relating to corrupt and       \nillegal payments, hiring practices and money  \nlaundering, as well as laws relating to doing \nbusiness with certain individuals, groups and \ncountries, such as the FCPA, the USA PATRIOT  \nAct and the U.K. Bribery Act. While we have   \ninvested and continue to invest significant   \nresources in training and in compliance       \nmonitoring, the geographical diversity of our \noperations, employees, clients and consumers, \nas well as the vendors and other third parties\nthat we deal with, greatly increases the risk \nthat we may be found in violation of such     \nrules or regulations and any such violation   \ncould subject us to significant penalties or  \nadversely affect our reputation. See for      \nexample, \u201c1MDB-Related Matters\u201d in Note 27 to \nthe consolidated financial statements in Part \nII, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In addition,    \nthere have been a number of highly publicized \ncases around the world, involving actual or   \nalleged fraud or other misconduct by employees\nin the financial services industry in recent  \nyears, and we have had and may in the future  \nhave employee misconduct. This misconduct has \nincluded and may also in the future include   \nintentional efforts to ignore or circumvent   \napplicable policies, rules or procedures or   \nmisappropriation of funds and the theft of    \nproprietary information, including proprietary\nsoftware. It is not always possible to deter  \nor prevent employee misconduct and the        \nprecautions we take to prevent and detect this\nactivity have not been and may not be         \neffective in all cases, as reflected by the   \nsettlements relating to 1MDB. The application \nof regulatory strategies and requirements in  \nthe U.S. and non-U.S.jurisdictions to         \nfacilitate the orderly resolution of large    \nfinancial institutions could create greater   \nrisk of loss for Group Inc.\u2019s security        \nholders. As described in \u201cBusiness \u2014          \nRegulation \u2014 Banking Supervision and          \nRegulation \u2014 Insolvency of an IDI or a BHC,\u201d  \nif the FDIC is appointed as receiver under    \nOLA, the rights of Group Inc.\u2019s creditors     \nwould be determined under OLA, and substantial\ndifferences exist in the rights of creditors  \nbetween OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,     \nincluding the right of the FDIC under OLA to  \ndisregard the strict priority of creditor     \nclaims in some circumstances, which could have\na material adverse effect on our debtholders. \nThe FDIC has announced that a single point of \nentry strategy may be a desirable strategy    \nunder OLA to resolve a large financial        \ninstitution in a manner that would, among     \nother things, impose losses on shareholders,  \ndebtholders and other creditors of the top-   \ntierBHC (in our case, Group Inc.), while the  \nBHC\u2019s subsidiaries may continue to operate. It\nis possible that the application of the single\npoint of entry strategy under OLA, in which   \nGroup Inc. would be the only entity to enter  \nresolution proceedings (and its material      \nbroker-dealer, bank and other operating       \nentities would not enter resolution           \nproceedings), would result in greater losses  \nto Group Inc.\u2019s security holders (including   \nholders of our fixed rate, floating rate and  \nindexed debt securities), than the losses that\nwould result from the application of a        \nbankruptcy proceeding or a different          \nresolution strategy, such as a multiple point \nof entry resolution strategy for Group Inc.   \nand certain of its material subsidiaries.     \nAssuming Group Inc. entered resolution        \nproceedings and that support from Group Inc.  \nor other available resources to its           \nsubsidiaries was sufficient to enable the     \nsubsidiaries to remain solvent, losses at the \nsubsidiary level would be transferred to Group\nInc. and ultimately borne by Group Inc.\u2019s     \nsecurity holders, third-party creditors of    \nGroup Inc.\u2019s subsidiaries would receive full  \nrecoveries on their claims, and Group Inc.\u2019s  \nsecurity holders (including our shareholders, \ndebtholders and other unsecured creditors)    \ncould face significant and possibly complete  \nlosses. In that case, Group Inc.\u2019s security   \nholders would face losses while the third-    \nparty creditors of Group Inc.\u2019s subsidiaries  \nwould incur no losses because the subsidiaries\nwould continue to operate and would not enter \nresolution or bankruptcy proceedings. In      \naddition, holders of Group Inc.\u2019s eligible    \nlong-term debt and holders of Group Inc.\u2019s    \nother debt securities could face losses ahead \nof its other similarly situated creditors in a\nresolution under OLA if the FDIC exercised its\nright, described above, to disregard the      \npriority of creditor claims. OLA also provides\nthe FDIC with authority to cause creditors and\nshareholders of the financial company in      \nreceivership to bear losses before taxpayers  \nare exposed to such losses, and amounts owed  \nto the U.S. government would generally receive\na statutory payment priority over the claims  \nof private creditors, including senior        \ncreditors. In addition, under OLA, claims of  \ncreditors (including debtholders) could be    \nsatisfied through the issuance of equity or   \nother securities in a bridge entity to which  \nGroup Inc.\u2019s assets are transferred. If such a\nsecurities-for-claimsexchange were            \nimplemented, there can be no assurance that   \nthe value of the securities of the bridge     \nentity would be sufficient to repay or satisfy\nall or any part of the creditor claims for    \nwhich the securities were exchanged. While the\nFDIC has issued regulations to implement OLA, \nnot all aspects of how the FDIC might exercise\nthis authority are known and additional       \nrulemaking is possible.                       \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    47  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions, including \nthe U.K. and the E.U., have implemented, or   \nare considering, changes to resolution regimes\nto provide resolution authorities with the    \nability to recapitalize a failing entity by   \nwriting down its unsecured debt or converting \nits unsecured debt into equity. Such \u201cbail-   \nin\u201dpowers are intended to enable the          \nrecapitalization of a failing institution by  \nallocating losses to its shareholders and     \nunsecured debtholders. For example, the Bank  \nof England requires a certain amount of       \nintercompany funding that we provide to our   \nmaterial U.K. subsidiaries to contain a       \ncontractual trigger to expressly permit the   \nBank of England to exercise such \u201cbail-       \nin\u201dpowers in certain circumstances. If the    \nintercompany funding we provide to our        \nsubsidiaries is \u201cbailed in,\u201d Group Inc.\u2019s     \nclaims on its subsidiaries would be           \nsubordinated to the claims of the             \nsubsidiaries\u2019 third-party creditors or written\ndown. U.S. regulators are considering and     \nnon-U.S.authorities have adopted requirements \nthat certain subsidiaries of large financial  \ninstitutions maintain minimum amounts of total\nloss-absorbing capacity that would pass losses\nup from the subsidiaries to the top-tierBHC   \nand, ultimately, to security holders of the   \ntop-tierBHC in the event of failure. The      \napplication of Group Inc.\u2019s proposed          \nresolution strategy could result in greater   \nlosses for Group Inc.\u2019s security holders. In  \nour resolution plan, Group Inc. would be      \nresolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The  \nstrategy described in our resolution plan is a\nvariant of the single point of entry strategy:\nGroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Funding LLC      \n(Funding IHC), a wholly-owned, direct         \nsubsidiary of Group Inc., would recapitalize  \nand provide liquidity to certain major        \nsubsidiaries, including through the           \nforgiveness of intercompany indebtedness, the \nextension of the maturities of intercompany   \nindebtedness and the extension of additional  \nintercompany loans. If this strategy were     \nsuccessful, creditors of some or all of Group \nInc.\u2019s major subsidiaries would receive full  \nrecoveries on their claims, while Group Inc.\u2019s\nsecurity holders could face significant and   \npossibly complete losses. To facilitate the   \nexecution of our resolution plan, we formed   \nFunding IHC. In exchange for an unsecured     \nsubordinated funding note and equity interest,\nGroup Inc. transferred certain intercompany   \nreceivables and substantially all of its      \nglobal core liquid assets (GCLA) to Funding   \nIHC, and agreed to transfer additional GCLA   \nabove prescribed thresholds. We also put in   \nplace a Capital and Liquidity Support         \nAgreement (CLSA) among Group Inc., Funding IHC\nand our major subsidiaries. Under the CLSA,   \nFunding IHC has provided Group Inc. with a    \ncommitted line of credit that allows Group    \nInc. to draw sufficient funds to meet its cash\nneeds during the ordinary course of business. \nIn addition, if our financial resources       \ndeteriorate so severely that resolution may be\nimminent, (i) the committed line of credit    \nwill automatically terminate and the unsecured\nsubordinated funding note will automatically  \nbe forgiven, (ii) all intercompany receivables\nowed by the major subsidiaries to Group Inc.  \nwill be transferred to Funding IHC or their   \nmaturities will be extended to five years,    \n(iii) Group Inc. will be obligated to transfer\nsubstantially all of its remaining            \nintercompany receivables and GCLA (other than \nan amount to fund anticipated bankruptcy      \nexpenses) to Funding IHC, and (iv) Funding IHC\nwill be obligated to provide capital and      \nliquidity support to the major subsidiaries.  \nGroup Inc.\u2019s and Funding IHC\u2019s obligations    \nunder the CLSA are secured pursuant to a      \nrelated security agreement. Such actions would\nmaterially and adversely affect Group Inc.\u2019s  \nliquidity. As a result, during a period of    \nsevere stress, Group Inc. might commence      \nbankruptcy proceedings at an earlier time than\nit otherwise would if the CLSA and related    \nsecurity agreement had not been implemented.  \nIf Group Inc.\u2019s proposed resolution strategy  \nwere successful, Group Inc.\u2019s security holders\ncould face losses while the third-party       \ncreditors of Group Inc.\u2019s major subsidiaries  \nwould incur no losses because those           \nsubsidiaries would continue to operate and not\nenter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings. As\npart of the strategy, Group Inc. could also   \nseek to elevate the priority of its guarantee \nobligations relating to its major             \nsubsidiaries\u2019 derivative contracts or transfer\nthem to another entity so that cross-default  \nand early termination rights would be stayed  \nunder the ISDA Protocols, as applicable, which\nwould result in holders of Group Inc.\u2019s       \neligible long-term debt and holders of Group  \nInc.\u2019s other debt securities incurring losses \nahead of the beneficiaries of those guarantee \nobligations. It is also possible that holders \nof Group Inc.\u2019s eligible long-term debt and   \nother debt securities could incur losses ahead\nof other similarly situated creditors of Group\nInc.\u2019s major subsidiaries. If Group Inc.\u2019s    \nproposed resolution strategy were not         \nsuccessful, Group Inc.\u2019s financial condition  \nwould be adversely impacted and Group Inc.\u2019s  \nsecurity holders, including debtholders, may  \nas a consequence be in a worse position than  \nif the strategy had not been implemented. In  \nall cases, any payments to debtholders are    \ndependent on our ability to make such payments\nand are therefore subject to our credit risk. \n                                      \n  48    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We make         \ninvestments in and finance entities that      \nengage in the production, storage and         \ntransportation of numerous commodities,       \nincluding many of the commodities referenced  \nabove. These activities subject us and/or the \nentities in which we invest to extensive and  \nevolving federal, state and local energy,     \nenvironmental, antitrust and other            \ngovernmental laws and regulations worldwide,  \nincluding environmental laws and regulations  \nrelating to, among others, air quality, water \nquality, waste management, transportation of  \nhazardous substances, natural resources, site \nremediation and health and safety.            \nAdditionally, rising climate change concerns  \nhave led to additional regulation that could  \nincrease the operating costs and adversely    \naffect the profitability of certain of our    \ninvestments. There may be substantial costs in\ncomplying with current or future laws and     \nregulations relating to our commodities-      \nrelated activities and investments. Compliance\nwith these laws and regulations could require \nsignificant commitments of capital toward     \nenvironmental monitoring, renovation of       \nstorage facilities or transport vessels,      \npayment of emission fees and carbon or other  \ntaxes, and application for, and holding of,   \npermits and licenses. Commodities involved in \nour intermediation activities and investments \nare also subject to the risk of unforeseen or \ncatastrophic events, which are likely to be   \noutside of our control, including those       \narising from the breakdown or failure of      \ntransport vessels, storage facilities or other\nequipment or processes or other mechanical    \nmalfunctions, fires, leaks, spills or release \nof hazardous substances, performance below    \nexpected levels of output or efficiency,      \nterrorist attacks, extreme weather events or  \nother natural disasters or other hostile or   \ncatastrophic events. In addition, we rely on  \nthird-party suppliers or service providers to \nperform their contractual obligations and any \nfailure on their part, including the failure  \nto obtain raw materials at reasonable prices  \nor to safely transport or store commodities,  \ncould expose us to costs or losses. Also,     \nwhile we seek to insure against potential     \nrisks, we may not be able to obtain insurance \nto cover some of these risks and the insurance\nthat we have may be inadequate to cover our   \nlosses. The occurrence of any of such events  \nmay prevent us from performing under our      \nagreements with clients, may impair our       \noperations or financial results and may result\nin litigation, regulatory action, negative    \npublicity or other reputational harm. We may  \nalso be required to divest or discontinue     \ncertain of these activities for regulatory or \nlegal reasons. Competition Our results have   \nbeen and may in the future be adversely       \naffected by the composition of our client     \nbase. Our client base is not the same as that \nof our major competitors. Our businesses may  \nhave a higher or lower percentage of clients  \nin certain industries or markets than some or \nall of our competitors. Therefore, unfavorable\nindustry developments or market conditions    \naffecting certain industries or markets have  \nresulted in the past and may result in the    \nfuture in our businesses underperforming      \nrelative to similar businesses of a competitor\nif our businesses have a higher concentration \nof clients in such industries or markets. For \nexample, our market-making businesses have a  \nhigher percentage of clients with actively    \nmanaged assets than our competitors and such  \nclients have in the past and may in the future\nbe disproportionately affected by low         \nvolatility.                                   \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    49  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCorrespondingly, favorable or simply less     \nadverse developments or market conditions     \ninvolving industries or markets in a business \nwhere we have a lower concentration of clients\nin such industry or market have also resulted \nin the past and may result in the future in   \nour underperforming relative to a similar     \nbusiness of a competitor that has a higher    \nconcentration of clients in such industry or  \nmarket. For example, we have a smaller        \ncorporate client base in our market-making    \nbusinesses than many of our peers and         \ntherefore those competitors may benefit more  \nfrom increased activity by corporate clients. \nSimilarly, we have not historically engaged in\nretail equities intermediation to the same    \nextent as other financial institutions, which \nhas in the past and could in the future       \nadversely affect our market share in equities \nexecution. The financial services industry is \nhighly competitive. The financial services    \nindustry and all of our businesses are        \nintensely competitive, and we expect them to  \nremain so. We compete on the basis of a number\nof factors, including transaction execution,  \nour products and services, innovation,        \nreputation, creditworthiness and price. There \nhas been substantial consolidation and        \nconvergence among companies in the financial  \nservices industry. This has hastened the      \nglobalization of the securities and other     \nfinancial services markets. As a result, we   \nhave had to commit capital to support our     \ninternational operations and to execute large \nglobal transactions. To the extent we expand  \ninto new business areas and new geographic    \nregions, we will face competitors with more   \nexperience and more established relationships \nwith clients, regulators and industry         \nparticipants in the relevant market, which    \ncould adversely affect our ability to expand. \nGovernments and regulators have adopted       \nregulations, imposed taxes, adopted           \ncompensation restrictions or otherwise put    \nforward various proposals that have impacted  \nor may impact our ability to conduct certain  \nof our businesses in a cost-effective manner  \nor at all in certain or all jurisdictions,    \nincluding proposals relating to restrictions  \non the type of activities in which financial  \ninstitutions are permitted to engage. These or\nother similar rules, many of which do not     \napply to all our U.S. or non-U.S.competitors, \ncould impact our ability to compete           \neffectively. Pricing and other competitive    \npressures in our businesses have continued to \nincrease, particularly in situations where    \nsome of our competitors may seek to increase  \nmarket share by reducing prices. For example, \nin connection with investment banking and     \nother assignments, in response to competitive \npressure we have experienced, we have extended\nand priced credit at levels that may not      \nalways fully compensate us for the risks we   \ntake. The financial services industry is      \nhighly interrelated in that a significant     \nvolume of transactions occur among a limited  \nnumber of members of that industry. Many      \ntransactions are syndicated to other financial\ninstitutions and financial institutions are   \noften counterparties in transactions. This has\nled to claims by other market participants and\nregulators that such institutions have        \ncolluded in order to manipulate markets or    \nmarket prices, including allegations that     \nantitrust laws have been violated. While we   \nhave extensive procedures and controls that   \nare designed to identify and prevent such     \nactivities, allegations of such activities,   \nparticularly by regulators, can have a        \nnegative reputational impact and can subject  \nus to large fines and settlements, and        \npotentially significant penalties, including  \ntreble damages. The growth of electronic      \ntrading and the introduction of new trading   \ntechnology has increased competition.         \nTechnology is fundamental to our business and \nour industry. The growth of electronic trading\nand the introduction of new technologies is   \nchanging our businesses and presenting us with\nnew challenges. Securities, futures and       \noptions transactions are increasingly         \noccurring electronically, both on our own     \nsystems and through other alternative trading \nsystems, and it appears that the trend toward \nalternative trading systems will continue.    \nSome of these alternative trading systems     \ncompete with us, particularly our exchange-   \nbased market-making activities, and we may    \nexperience continued competitive pressures in \nthese and other areas. In addition, the       \nincreased use by our clients of low-          \ncostelectronic trading systems and direct     \nelectronic access to trading markets could    \ncause a reduction in commissions and spreads. \nAs our clients increasingly use our systems to\ntrade directly in the markets, we may incur   \nliabilities as a result of their use of our   \norder routing and execution infrastructure. We\nhave invested significant resources into the  \ndevelopment of electronic trading systems and \nexpect to continue to do so, but there is no  \nassurance that the revenues generated by these\nsystems will yield an adequate return,        \nparticularly given the generally lower        \ncommissions arising from electronic trades.   \n                                      \n  50    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur businesses would be adversely affected if \nwe are unable to hire and retain qualified    \nemployees. Our performance is largely         \ndependent on the talents and efforts of highly\nskilled people; therefore, our continued      \nability to compete effectively in our         \nbusinesses, to manage our businesses          \neffectively and to expand into new businesses \nand geographic areas depends on our ability to\nattract new talented and diverse employees and\nto retain and motivate our existing employees.\nFactors that affect our ability to attract and\nretain such employees include the level and   \ncomposition of our compensation and benefits, \nand our reputation as a successful business   \nwith a culture of fairly hiring, training and \npromoting qualified employees. As a           \nsignificant portion of the compensation that  \nwe pay to our employees is in the form of     \nyear-enddiscretionary compensation, a         \nsignificant portion of which is in the form of\ndeferred equity-related awards, declines in   \nour profitability, or in the outlook for our  \nfuture profitability, as well as regulatory   \nlimitations on compensation levels and terms, \ncan negatively impact our ability to hire and \nretain highly qualified employees. Competition\nfrom within the financial services industry   \nand from businesses outside the financial     \nservices industry, including the technology   \nindustry, for qualified employees has often   \nbeen intense. We have experienced increased   \ncompetition in hiring and retaining employees \nto address the demands of new regulatory      \nrequirements, expanding consumer-oriented     \nbusinesses and our technology initiatives.    \nThis is also the case in emerging and growth  \nmarkets, where we are often competing for     \nqualified employees with entities that have a \nsignificantly greater presence or more        \nextensive experience in the region. Changes in\nlaw or regulation in jurisdictions in which   \nour operations are located that affect taxes  \non our employees\u2019 income, or the amount or    \ncomposition of compensation, may also         \nadversely affect our ability to hire and      \nretain qualified employees in those           \njurisdictions. As described further in        \n\u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation \u2014Compensation          \nPractices\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Form     \n10-K,our compensation practices are subject to\nreview by, and the standards of, the FRB. As a\nlarge global financial and banking            \ninstitution, we are subject to limitations on \ncompensation practices (which may or may not  \naffect our competitors) by the FRB, the PRA,  \nthe FCA, the FDIC and other regulators        \nworldwide. These limitations, including any   \nimposed by or as a result of future           \nlegislation or regulation, may require us to  \nalter our compensation practices in ways that \ncould adversely affect our ability to attract \nand retain talented employees. Our operating  \nexpenses and efficiency ratio depend, in part,\non our overall headcount and the proportion of\nour employees located in strategic locations. \nOur future human capital resource requirements\nand the benefits provided by strategic        \nlocations are uncertain, and we may not       \nrealize the benefits we anticipate. Item 1B.  \nUnresolved Staff Comments There are no        \nmaterial unresolved written comments that were\nreceived from the SEC staff 180 days or more  \nbefore the end of our fiscal year relating to \nour periodic or current reports under the     \nExchange Act. Item 2. Properties In the U.S.  \nand elsewhere in the Americas, we have offices\nconsisting of approximately 6.6 million square\nfeet of leased and owned space. Our principal \nexecutive offices are located at 200 West     \nStreet, New York, New York and consist of     \napproximately 2.1 million square feet. The    \nbuilding is located on a parcel leased from   \nBattery Park City Authority pursuant to a     \nground lease.

Under the terms of the ground   \nlease, we made a lump sum ground rent payment \nin June 2007 of $161 million for rent through \nthe term of the lease. In Europe, the Middle  \nEast and Africa, we have offices consisting of\napproximately 1.5 million square feet of      \nleased and owned space. Our European          \nheadquarters is located in London at Plumtree \nCourt, consisting of 826,000 square feet under\na lease which can be terminated in 2039. In   \nAsia, Australia and New Zealand, we have      \noffices consisting of approximately 2.6       \nmillion square feet, including our offices in \nIndia, and regional headquarters in Tokyo and \nHong Kong. In India, we have offices with     \napproximately 1.6 million square feet, the    \nmajority of which have leases that will expire\nin 2028.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Executive\nOverview We generated net earnings of $9.46   \nbillion for 2020, an increase of 12% compared \nwith $8.47 billion for 2019. Diluted earnings \nper common share (EPS) was $24.74 for 2020, an\nincrease of 18% compared with $21.03 for 2019.\nReturn on average common shareholders\u2019 equity \n(ROE) was 11.1% for 2020, compared with 10.0% \nfor 2019. Book value per common share was     \n$236.15 as of December 2020, 8.1% higher      \ncompared with December 2019. During 2020, we  \nrecorded net provisions for litigation and    \nregulatory proceedings of $3.42 billion, which\nreduced diluted EPS by $9.51 and reduced ROE  \nby 3.9 percentage points. During 2019, we     \nrecorded net provisions for litigation and    \nregulatory proceedings of $1.24 billion, which\nreduced diluted EPS by $3.16 and reduced ROE  \nby 1.5 percentage points. Net revenues were   \n$44.56 billion for 2020, 22% higher than 2019.\nNet revenues were significantly higher in both\nFixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) \nand Equities within Global Markets, driven by \nstrong client activity, and in Investment     \nBanking, reflecting significantly higher net  \nrevenues in both Equity and Debt underwriting.\nNet revenues in Consumer & Wealth Management  \nwere higher, reflecting growth in Wealth      \nmanagement and Consumer banking. These        \nincreases were partially offset by lower net  \nrevenues in Asset Management, due to          \nsignificantly lower net revenues in Equity    \ninvestments and Lending and debt investments, \nwhich reflected the impact of a challenging   \nenvironment earlier this year. Provision for  \ncredit losses was $3.10 billion for 2020,     \ncompared with $1.07 billion for 2019. This    \nincrease was primarily due to significantly   \nhigher provisions related to wholesale loans  \nas a result of individual impairments and     \nratings downgrades during the year, as well as\ndeterioration and uncertainty in the broader  \neconomic environment (incorporating the       \naccounting for credit losses under the Current\nExpected Credit Losses (CECL) standard)       \nreflecting the impact of the global outbreak  \nof the coronavirus (COVID-19)pandemic. The    \nincrease also included higher provisions      \nrelated to credit card loans, due to growth in\nthe portfolio. See Note 3 to the consolidated \nfinancial statements for further information  \nabout ASU No. 2016-13,\u201cFinancial Instruments \u2014\nCredit Losses (Topic 326) \u2014 Measurement of    \nCredit Losses on Financial Instruments.\u201d      \nOperating expenses were $28.98 billion for    \n2020, 16% higher than 2019, primarily         \nreflecting significantly higher net provisions\nfor litigation and regulatory proceedings,    \nhigher compensation and benefits expenses     \n(reflecting improved financial performance)   \nand higher transaction based expenses         \n(reflecting an increase in activity levels).  \nOur efficiency ratio (total operating expenses\ndivided by total net revenues) for 2020 was   \n65.0%, compared with 68.1% for 2019. Net      \nprovisions for litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings increased our efficiency ratio for\n2020 by 7.6 percentage points and for 2019 by \n3.4 percentage points. During 2020, we        \nreturned $3.72 billion of capital to common   \nshareholders, including $1.93 billion of      \ncommon share repurchases, all during the first\nquarter, and $1.80 billion in common stock    \ndividends. As of December 2020, our Common    \nEquity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 14.7%  \nunder the Standardized Capital Rules and 13.4%\nunder the Advanced Capital Rules. See Note 20 \nto the consolidated financial statements for  \nfurther information about our capital ratios. \nIn the beginning of 2020, we announced        \nstrategic initiatives related to expense      \nefficiencies and funding optimization with an \nemphasis on improving profitability and       \nshareholder returns. We estimated that by     \nyear-end2022 we will generate (i) $1.3 billion\nof annual run-rateexpense efficiencies, which \nwill create capacity to fund growth, and (ii) \n$1.0 billion of annual run-rateinterest       \nexpense savings through funding optimization  \nfrom the growth of deposits and the reduction \nof wholesale unsecured funding. During 2020,  \nwe achieved approximately half of the expense \nefficiencies target of $1.3 billion, which    \nenabled us to partially offset the cost of    \ninvestment in our business and our people in  \n2020. While we did not achieve interest       \nexpense savings during 2020, we remain focused\non achieving the $1.0 billion interest expense\nsavings by year-end2022, based on the current \npricing of our consumer deposits, as well as  \nhigher deposit balances.                      \n                                      \n  54    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Our      \nestimate of credit losses entails judgment    \nabout collectability at the reporting dates,  \nand there are uncertainties inherent in those \njudgments. The allowance for credit losses is \nsubject to a governance process that involves \nreview and approval by senior management      \nwithin our independent risk oversight and     \ncontrol functions. Personnel within our       \nindependent risk oversight and control        \nfunctions are responsible for forecasting the \neconomic variables that underlie the economic \nscenarios that are used in the modeling of    \nexpected credit losses. While we use the best \ninformation available to determine this       \nestimate, future adjustments to the allowance \nmay be necessary based on, among other things,\nchanges in the economic environment or        \nvariances between actual results and the      \noriginal assumptions used. Loans are charged  \noff against the allowance for loan losses when\ndeemed to be uncollectible. We also record an \nallowance for credit losses on lending        \ncommitments which are held for investment that\nare accounted for at amortized cost. Such     \nallowance is determined using the same        \nmethodology as the allowance for loan losses, \nwhile also taking into consideration the      \nprobability of drawdowns or funding, and      \nwhether such commitments are cancellable by   \nus. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial  \nstatements for further information about the  \nallowance for credit losses. Use of Estimates \nU.S. GAAP requires us to make certain         \nestimates and assumptions. In addition to the \nestimates we make in connection with fair     \nvalue measurements and the allowance for      \ncredit losses on loans and lending commitments\nheld for investment and accounted for at      \namortized cost, the use of estimates and      \nassumptions is also important in determining  \nthe accounting for goodwill and identifiable  \nintangible assets, provisions for losses that \nmay arise from litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings (including governmental           \ninvestigations), and provisions for losses    \nthat may arise from tax audits. Goodwill is   \nassessed for impairment annually in the fourth\nquarter or more frequently if events occur or \ncircumstances change that indicate an         \nimpairment may exist. When assessing goodwill \nfor impairment, first, a qualitative          \nassessment can be made to determine whether it\nis more likely than not that the estimated    \nfair value of a reporting unit is less than   \nits estimated carrying value. If the results  \nof the qualitative assessment are not         \nconclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is   \nperformed. Alternatively, a quantitative      \ngoodwill test can be performed without        \nperforming a qualitative assessment.          \nEstimating the fair value of our reporting    \nunits requires judgment. Critical inputs to   \nthe fair value estimates include projected    \nearnings and allocated equity. There is       \ninherent uncertainty in the projected         \nearnings. The estimated carrying value of each\nreporting unit reflects an allocation of total\nshareholders\u2019 equity and represents the       \nestimated amount of total shareholders\u2019 equity\nrequired to support the activities of the     \nreporting unit under currently applicable     \nregulatory capital requirements. See Note 12  \nto the consolidated financial statements for  \nfurther information about goodwill. If we     \nexperience a prolonged or severe period of    \nweakness in the business environment,         \nfinancial markets, our performance or our     \ncommon stock price, or additional increases in\ncapital requirements, our goodwill could be   \nimpaired in the future. Identifiable          \nintangible assets are tested for impairment   \nwhen events or changes in circumstances       \nsuggest that an asset\u2019s or asset group\u2019s      \ncarrying value may not be fully recoverable.  \nJudgment is required to evaluate whether      \nindications of potential impairment have      \noccurred, and to test intangible assets for   \nimpairment, if required. An impairment is     \nrecognized if the estimated undiscounted cash \nflows relating to the asset or asset group is \nless than the corresponding carrying value.   \nSee Note 12 to the consolidated financial     \nstatements for further information about      \nidentifiable intangible assets. We also       \nestimate and provide for potential losses that\nmay arise out of litigation and regulatory    \nproceedings to the extent that such losses are\nprobable and can be reasonably estimated. In  \naddition, we estimate the upper end of the    \nrange of reasonably possible aggregate loss in\nexcess of the related reserves for litigation \nand regulatory proceedings where we believe   \nthe risk of loss is more than slight. See     \nNotes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial \nstatements for information about certain      \njudicial, litigation and regulatory           \nproceedings. Significant judgment is required \nin making these estimates and our final       \nliabilities may ultimately be materially      \ndifferent. Our total estimated liability in   \nrespect of litigation and regulatory          \nproceedings is determined on a case-by-       \ncasebasis and represents an estimate of       \nprobable losses after considering, among other\nfactors, the progress of each case, proceeding\nor investigation, our experience and the      \nexperience of others in similar cases,        \nproceedings or investigations, and the        \nopinions and views of legal counsel. In       \naccounting for income taxes, we recognize tax \npositions in the financial statements only    \nwhen it is more likely than not that the      \nposition will be sustained on examination by  \nthe relevant taxing authority based on the    \ntechnical merits of the position. See Note 24 \nto the consolidated financial statements for  \nfurther information about income taxes.

During 2020, the       \nCOVID-19pandemic initially negatively impacted\neconomic activity and financial markets. In   \nresponse, central banks and governments       \nglobally intervened with widespread monetary  \nand fiscal stimulus to support the economy and\nfinancial markets. As a result, global equity \nprices rebounded sharply and finished the year\nhigher than at the end of 2019. In addition,  \nunemployment and retail spending improved     \nthroughout the year after the initial effects \nof the pandemic. If the ongoing efforts to    \nmitigate the impact of the COVID-19pandemic   \nturn out to be ineffective, it may lead to a  \ndecline in asset prices, investors continuing \nto favor asset classes that typically generate\nlower fees, investors withdrawing their assets\nand consumers withdrawing their deposits or   \ndeterioration in consumer credit, and net     \nrevenues and the provision for credit losses  \nin Consumer & Wealth Management would likely  \nbe negatively impacted. 2020 versus 2019. Net \nrevenues in Consumer & Wealth Management were \n$6.00 billion for 2020, 15% higher than 2019. \nNet revenues in Wealth management were $4.78  \nbillion, 10% higher than 2019, primarily      \nreflecting higher Management and other fees,  \nprimarily reflecting the impact of higher     \naverage AUS, higher transaction volumes and   \nthe impact of the full-year consolidation of  \nGS Personal Financial Management, partially   \noffset by a lower average effective management\nfee due to shifts in the mix of client assets \nand strategies. Net revenues in Consumer      \nbanking were $1.21 billion, 40% higher than   \n2019, reflecting higher credit card loan and  \ndeposit balances. Provision for credit losses \nwas $758 million for 2020, 79% higher than    \n2019, reflecting growth in credit card loans  \nand the impact of the COVID-19pandemic on the \nbroader economic environment (incorporating   \nthe accounting for credit losses under the    \nCECL standard). See Note 3 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements for further information  \nabout ASU No. 2016-13. Operating expenses were\n$4.90 billion for 2020, 8% higher than 2019,  \nprimarily due to higher expenses related to   \nthe impact of the full-year consolidation of  \nGS Personal Financial Management and our      \ncredit card activities.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis The FRB  \nevaluates us based, in part, on whether we    \nhave the capital necessary to continue        \noperating under the baseline and severely     \nadverse scenarios provided by the FRB and     \nthose developed internally. This evaluation   \nalso takes into account our process for       \nidentifying risk, our controls and governance \nfor capital planning, and our guidelines for  \nmaking capital planning decisions. In         \naddition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make  \ncapital distributions (i.e., dividend payments\nand repurchases or redemptions of stock,      \nsubordinated debt or other capital securities)\nand issue capital, across the range of        \nmacroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific     \nassumptions. The FRB determines the stress    \ncapital buffer (SCB) applicable to us based on\nits own annual stress test. The SCB under the \nStandardized approach is calculated as (i) the\ndifference between our starting and minimum   \nprojected CET1 capital ratios under the       \nsupervisory severely adverse scenario and (ii)\nour planned common stock dividends for each of\nthe fourth through seventh quarters of the    \nplanning horizon, expressed as a percentage of\nrisk-weighted assets (RWAs). We submitted our \n2020 CCAR capital plan in April 2020 and      \npublished a summary of our annual DFAST       \nresults in June 2020. See \u201cBusiness \u2014         \nAvailable Information\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of   \nthis Form 10-K.With respect to our 2020 CCAR  \nsubmission, the FRB notified us that our SCB  \nbeginning on October 1, 2020 is 6.6%, bringing\nour Standardized CET1 capital ratio           \nrequirement to 13.6%. In light of the impact  \nof the COVID-19pandemic on the economy, the   \nFRB required all large bank holding companies \n(BHCs) to suspend stock repurchases through   \nthe fourth quarter of 2020 and not to increase\ncommon stock dividends or pay common stock    \ndividends in excess of their average net      \nincome over the prior four quarters. The FRB  \nalso required large BHCs, including us, to    \nresubmit their capital plans in November 2020 \nunder the updated scenarios provided by the   \nFRB, and released the results of the          \nresubmissions in December 2020. The FRB did   \nnot change our SCB as a result of our         \nresubmission, but has extended the period to  \nrecalculate it to March 31, 2021. The FRB also\nmodified the existing restrictions on capital \nactions by permitting stock repurchases and   \ncommon stock dividends, that in aggregate, do \nnot exceed the average net income over the    \nprior four quarters and requiring large BHCs  \nto not increase their common stock dividend in\nthe first quarter of 2021. We plan to maintain\nboth common and preferred dividends, and      \nresumed common stock repurchases in the first \nquarter of 2021, while complying with these   \ncapital restrictions. In addition, we will    \ncontinue deploying capital to our businesses  \nwhere returns are accretive and otherwise     \nreturn it to our shareholders as permitted by \nthe FRB. GS Bank USA has its own capital      \nplanning process, but was not required to     \nsubmit its annual stress test results to the  \nFRB in 2020. Based on growth in GS Bank USA\u2019s \naverage balance sheet, it will be required to \nsubmit its annual stress test results in 2022.\nGoldman Sachs International (GSI), GSIB and   \nGoldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE) also have \ntheir own capital planning and stress testing \nprocess, which incorporates internally        \ndesigned stress tests developed in accordance \nwith the guidelines of their respective       \nregulators. Contingency Capital Plan. As part \nof our comprehensive capital management       \npolicy, we maintain a contingency capital     \nplan. Our contingency capital plan provides a \nframework for analyzing and responding to a   \nperceived or actual capital deficiency,       \nincluding, but not limited to, identification \nof drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as\nmitigants and potential actions. It outlines  \nthe appropriate communication procedures to   \nfollow during a crisis period, including      \ninternal dissemination of information, as well\nas timely communication with external         \nstakeholders. Capital Attribution. We assess  \neach of our businesses\u2019 capital usage based on\nour internal assessment of risks, which       \nincorporates an attribution of our relevant   \nregulatory capital requirements. These        \nregulatory capital requirements are allocated \nusing our attributed equity framework, which  \ntakes into consideration our most binding     \ncapital constraints. Our most binding capital \nconstraint is based on the results of the     \nFRB\u2019s annual stress test, which includes the  \nStandardized risk-based capital and leverage  \nratios. See \u201cSegment Assets and Operating     \nResults \u2014 Segment Operating Results\u201d for      \ninformation about our attributed equity by    \nsegment. Effective on January 1, 2021, we     \nadjusted the attributed equity framework in   \nline with the impact of the SCB Rule and our  \nSCB of 6.6%, which became effective on October\n1, 2020 under the Standardized approach. Share\nRepurchase Program. We use our share          \nrepurchase program to help maintain the       \nappropriate level of common equity. The       \nrepurchase program is effected primarily      \nthrough regular open-market purchases (which  \nmay include repurchase plans designed to      \ncomply with Rule 10b5-1and accelerated share  \nrepurchases), the amounts and timing of which \nare determined primarily by our current and   \nprojected capital position and our capital    \nplan submitted to the FRB as part of CCAR. The\namounts and timing of the repurchases may also\nbe influenced by general market conditions and\nthe prevailing price and trading volumes of   \nour common stock.                             \n                                      \n  76    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Our      \nliquidity position during 2020 remained       \nstrong, as our GCLA averaged $283 billion for \nthe year. We have continued to access our     \ntraditional funding sources in the normal     \ncourse and service our debt and other         \nobligations on a timely basis. Our CET1       \ncapital ratios under the Standardized approach\nincreased to 14.7% as of December 2020, up 140\nbasis points compared with December 2019, as  \nwe continued to support our clients, while    \nmanaging our capital. We suspended stock      \nrepurchases during the first quarter of 2020  \nand, consistent with the FRB\u2019s requirement for\nall large BHCs, extended the suspension of    \nstock repurchases through the fourth quarter  \nof 2020. We resumed stock repurchases in the  \nfirst quarter of 2021.

As a     \nresult of the COVID-19pandemic, we have had to\napply a greater degree of judgment in making  \ncertain accounting estimates and assumptions. \nThe process of estimating the allowance for   \ncredit losses is inherently judgmental in     \nnature, given that it involves forecasts of   \nfuture economic conditions. The uncertainty as\nto the severity and duration of the impact of \nthe COVID-19pandemic has made this process    \nmore challenging, as it has resulted in       \ngreater subjectivity in our economic          \nforecasts. This uncertainty also impacts the  \nestimation of the fair value for less liquid  \nfinancial instruments that lack price         \ntransparency, where valuation involves        \njudgment regarding estimated future cash flows\nor other significant unobservable inputs. See \nNote 9 to the consolidated financial          \nstatements for further information about our  \nallowance for credit losses and Note 4 to the \nconsolidated financial statements for further \ninformation about fair value measurements. In \naddition, we assessed goodwill for impairment \nas of December 2020 and determined that it was\nnot impaired. See Note 12 to the consolidated \nfinancial statements for further information  \nabout goodwill. The COVID-19pandemic gave rise\nto higher volatility levels in financial      \nmarkets and correspondingly higher client     \nactivity levels. We have assisted clients in  \nnavigating the unpredictable and unprecedented\noperating environment by providing complex    \nrisk intermediation, financing solutions and  \nbespoke advice, utilizing our balance sheet,  \nas necessary. Our average daily Value-at-     \nRisk(VaR) for 2020 was $94 million, $38       \nmillion higher than 2019. We have maintained  \nour proactive approach to managing market risk\nlevels, which entails ongoing review and      \nmonitoring of exposures and focusing on ways  \nto mitigate risk. With respect to credit risk,\nthe improvement in economic conditions in the \nsecond half of 2020 from the significant      \ncontraction in the second quarter of 2020 has,\nin general, helped to stabilize conditions in \nthe credit markets. In relationship lending,  \nthe drawn balance on credit lines, which      \nspiked early in the pandemic, was back to pre-\npandemiclevels as of December 2020. While     \nborrowers, in general, faced less challenging \ncircumstances in the second half of the year, \ncredit risk remains high for borrowers in     \nindustries that continue to face significant  \ndisruptions due to the COVID-19pandemic, such \nas companies in the oil and gas, gaming and   \nlodging, and airlines industries. Throughout  \nthis crisis, we have remained highly focused  \non monitoring of credit exposures and         \nmanagement of margin calls and disputes. Our  \nrisk positions remained balanced, controlled  \nand adequately provisioned for, both in terms \nof counterparty risk and sector exposure. See \n\u201cMarket Risk Management\u201d and \u201cCredit Risk     \nManagement\u201d for further information. Our      \nactions in response to the COVID-19pandemic   \nhave included granting forbearance to certain \ncorporate and other borrowers who have made   \nrequests to defer payments. We had            \napproximately $880 million of corporate loans \nand approximately $155 million of commercial  \nreal estate loans under forbearance as of     \nDecember 2020. We have continued to provide   \nrelief to consumers through programs to help  \nthem manage the financial challenges that they\nface as a result of the COVID-19pandemic. The \naccommodations under these programs include   \nproviding borrowers of installment and credit \ncard loans the ability to modify or defer     \npayments without incurring interest charges   \nand permitting Marcus depositors to access    \ncertificates of deposit early without a       \npenalty. As of December 2020, installment and \ncredit card loans with a gross carrying value \nof approximately $120 million were enrolled in\nsuch programs. In aggregate, loans under      \nforbearance or relief programs represented    \napproximately 1% of total loans.              \n                                      \n  82    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Overview and Structure  \nof Risk Management Overview We believe that   \neffective risk management is critical to our  \nsuccess. Accordingly, we have established an  \nenterprise risk management framework that     \nemploys a comprehensive, integrated approach  \nto risk management, and is designed to enable \ncomprehensive risk management processes       \nthrough which we identify, assess, monitor and\nmanage the risks we assume in conducting our  \nactivities. Our risk management structure is  \nbuilt around three core components:           \ngovernance, processes and people. Governance. \nRisk management governance starts with the    \nBoard, which both directly and through its    \ncommittees, including its Risk Committee,     \noversees our risk management policies and     \npractices implemented through the enterprise  \nrisk management framework. The Board is also  \nresponsible for the annual review and approval\nof our risk appetite statement. The risk      \nappetite statement describes the levels and   \ntypes of risk we are willing to accept or to  \navoid, in order to achieve our objectives     \nincluded in our strategic business plan, while\nremaining in compliance with regulatory       \nrequirements. The Board reviews our strategic \nbusiness plan and is ultimately responsible   \nfor overseeing and providing direction about  \nour strategy and risk appetite.               \n                                      \n  84    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Although we have   \n  \u2022    access to various central bank         \n       funding programs, we do not assume     \n       reliance on additional sources of      \n       funding in a liquidity crisis; and     \n                                              \n                                              \n       A combination of contractual           \n       outflows, such as upcoming maturities  \n       of unsecured debt, and contingent      \n       outflows, including, but not limited   \n       to, the withdrawal of customer credit  \n       balances in our prime brokerage        \n  \u2022    business, increase in variation        \n       margin requirements due to adverse     \n       changes in the value of our            \n       exchange-traded                        \n       andOTC-clearedderivatives, and         \n       withdrawals of deposits that have no   \n       contractual maturity.                  \n                                              \nIntraday Liquidity Model. Our Intraday        \nLiquidity Model measures our intraday         \nliquidity needs using a scenario analysis     \ncharacterized by the same qualitative elements\nas our Modeled Liquidity Outflow. The model   \nassesses the risk of increased intraday       \nliquidity requirements during a scenario where\naccess to sources of intraday liquidity may   \nbecome constrained. Long-Term Stress Testing. \nWe utilize longer-term stress tests to take a \nforward view on our liquidity position through\nprolonged stress periods in which we          \nexperience a severe liquidity stress and      \nrecover in an environment that continues to be\nchallenging. We are focused on ensuring       \nconservative asset-liability management to    \nprepare for a prolonged period of potential   \nstress, seeking to maintain a diversified     \nfunding profile with an appropriate tenor,    \ntaking into consideration the characteristics \nand liquidity profile of our assets.          \nResolution Liquidity Models. In connection    \nwith our resolution planning efforts, we have \nestablished our Resolution Liquidity Adequacy \nand Positioning framework, which estimates    \nliquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a\nstressed environment. The liquidity needs are \nmeasured using our Modeled Liquidity Outflow  \nassumptions and include certain additional    \ninter-affiliate exposures. We have also       \nestablished our Resolution Liquidity Execution\nNeed framework, which measures the liquidity  \nneeds of our major subsidiaries to stabilize  \nand wind-down following a Group Inc.          \nbankruptcy filing in accordance with our      \npreferred resolution strategy. In addition, we\nhave established a triggers and alerts        \nframework, which is designed to provide the   \nBoard with information needed to make an      \ninformed decision on whether and when to      \ncommence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.\nLimits We use liquidity risk limits at various\nlevels and across liquidity risk types to     \nmanage the size of our liquidity exposures.   \nLimits are measured relative to acceptable    \nlevels of risk given our liquidity risk       \ntolerance. See \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for information about the limit   \napproval process. Limits are monitored by     \nTreasury and Liquidity Risk. Liquidity Risk is\nresponsible for identifying and escalating to \nsenior management and/or the appropriate risk \ncommittee, on a timely basis, instances where \nlimits have been exceeded.                    \n                                      \n  92    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

The fair value of   \nour unencumbered assets averaged $214.06      \nbillion for the three months ended December   \n2020, $206.01 billion for the three months    \nended December 2019, $207.60 billion for the  \nyear ended December 2020 and $202.03 billion  \nfor the year ended December 2019. We do not   \nconsider these assets liquid enough to be     \neligible for our GCLA. Liquidity Regulatory   \nFramework As a BHC, we are subject to a       \nminimum Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under  \nthe LCR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies. The LCR rule requires    \norganizations to maintain an adequate ratio of\neligible high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to \nexpected net cash outflows under an acute     \nshort-term liquidity stress scenario. Eligible\nHQLA excludes HQLA held by subsidiaries that  \nis in excess of their minimum requirement and \nis subject to transfer restrictions. We are   \nrequired to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. We\nexpect that fluctuations in client activity,  \nbusiness mix and the market environment will  \nimpact our LCR.                               \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    93  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Stress testing is a method of \ndetermining the effect of various hypothetical\nstress scenarios. We use stress testing to    \nexamine risks of specific portfolios, as well \nas the potential impact of our significant    \nrisk exposures. We use a variety of stress    \ntesting techniques to calculate the potential \nloss from a wide range of market moves on our \nportfolios, including firmwide stress tests,  \nsensitivity analysis and scenario analysis.   \nThe results of our various stress tests are   \nanalyzed together for risk management         \npurposes. See \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk \nManagement\u201d for information about firmwide    \nstress tests. Sensitivity analysis is used to \nquantify the impact of a market move in a     \nsingle risk factor across all positions (e.g.,\nequity prices or credit spreads) using a      \nvariety of defined market shocks, ranging from\nthose that could be expected over a one-      \ndaytime horizon up to those that could take   \nmany months to occur. We also use sensitivity \nanalysis to quantify the impact of the default\nof any single entity, which captures the risk \nof large or concentrated exposures. Scenario  \nanalysis is used to quantify the impact of a  \nspecified event, including how the event      \nimpacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. \nFor example, for sovereign stress testing we  \ncalculate potential direct exposure associated\nwith our sovereign positions, as well as the  \ncorresponding debt, equity and currency       \nexposures associated with our non-            \nsovereignpositions that may be impacted by the\nsovereign distress. When conducting scenario  \nanalysis, we often consider a number of       \npossible outcomes for each scenario, ranging  \nfrom moderate to severely adverse market      \nimpacts. In addition, these stress tests are  \nconstructed using both historical events and  \nforward-looking hypothetical scenarios. Unlike\nVaR measures, which have an implied           \nprobability because they are calculated at a  \nspecified confidence level, there may not be  \nan implied probability that our stress testing\nscenarios will occur. Instead, stress testing \nis used to model both moderate and more       \nextreme moves in underlying market factors.   \nWhen estimating potential loss, we generally  \nassume that our positions cannot be reduced or\nhedged (although experience demonstrates that \nwe are generally able to do so).              \n                                      \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    97  \n                                      \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

VaR    \nexcludes the impact of changes in counterparty\ncredit spreads, our own credit spreads and    \nunsecured funding spreads on derivatives, as  \nwell as changes in our own credit spreads     \n(debt valuation adjustment) on financial      \nliabilities for which the fair value option   \nwas elected. The estimated sensitivity to a   \none basis point increase in credit spreads    \n(counterparty and our own) and unsecured      \nfunding spreads on derivatives (including     \nhedges) was a loss of $3 million as of        \nDecember 2020 and $2 million as of December   \n2019. In addition, the estimated sensitivity  \nto a one basis point increase in our own      \ncredit spreads on financial liabilities for   \nwhich the fair value option was elected was a \ngain of $22 million as of December 2020 and   \n$29 million as of December 2019. However, the \nactual net impact of a change in our own      \ncredit spreads is also affected by the        \nliquidity, duration and convexity (as the     \nsensitivity is not linear to changes in       \nyields) of those financial liabilities for    \nwhich the fair value option was elected, as   \nwell as the relative performance of any hedges\nundertaken. Interest Rate Sensitivity. Loans  \naccounted for at amortized cost were $99.69   \nbillion as of December 2020 and $89.20 billion\nas of December 2019, substantially all of     \nwhich had floating interest rates. The        \nestimated sensitivity to a 100 basis point    \nincrease in interest rates on such loans was  \n$737 million as of December 2020 and $681     \nmillion as of December 2019 of additional     \ninterest income over a twelve-month period,   \nwhich does not take into account the potential\nimpact of an increase in costs to fund such   \nloans. See Note 9 to the consolidated         \nfinancial statements for further information  \nabout loans accounted for at amortized cost.  \nOther Market Risk Considerations We make      \ninvestments in securities that are accounted  \nfor as available-for-sale, held-to-maturityor \nunder the equity method which are included in \ninvestments in the consolidated balance       \nsheets.

These systems also provide      \nmanagement with comprehensive information     \nabout our aggregate credit risk by product,   \ninternal credit rating, industry, country and \nregion. Risk Measures We measure our credit   \nrisk based on the potential loss in the event \nof non-paymentby a counterparty using current \nand potential exposure. For derivatives and   \nsecurities financing transactions, current    \nexposure represents the amount presently owed \nto us after taking into account applicable    \nnetting and collateral arrangements, while    \npotential exposure represents our estimate of \nthe future exposure that could arise over the \nlife of a transaction based on market         \nmovements within a specified confidence level.\nPotential exposure also takes into account    \nnetting and collateral arrangements. For loans\nand lending commitments, the primary measure  \nis a function of the notional amount of the   \nposition. Stress Tests We conduct regular     \nstress tests to calculate the credit          \nexposures, including potential concentrations \nthat would result from applying shocks to     \ncounterparty credit ratings or credit risk    \nfactors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates,\nequity prices). These shocks cover a wide     \nrange of moderate and more extreme market     \nmovements, including shocks to multiple risk  \nfactors, consistent with the occurrence of a  \nsevere market or economic event. In the case  \nof sovereign default, we estimate the direct  \nimpact of the default on our sovereign credit \nexposures, changes to our credit exposures    \narising from potential market moves in        \nresponse to the default, and the impact of    \ncredit market deterioration on corporate      \nborrowers and counterparties that may result  \nfrom the sovereign default. Unlike potential  \nexposure, which is calculated within a        \nspecified confidence level, stress testing    \ndoes not generally assume a probability of    \nthese events occurring. We also perform       \nfirmwide stress tests. See \u201cOverview and      \nStructure of Risk Management\u201d for information \nabout firmwide stress tests. To supplement    \nthese regular stress tests, as described      \nabove, we also conduct tailored stress tests  \non an ad hoc basis in response to specific    \nmarket events that we deem significant. We    \nalso utilize these stress tests to estimate   \nthe indirect impact of certain hypothetical   \nevents on our country exposures, such as the  \nimpact of credit market deterioration on      \ncorporate borrowers and counterparties along  \nwith the shocks to the risk factors described \nabove. The parameters of these shocks vary    \nbased on the scenario reflected in each stress\ntest. We review estimated losses produced by  \nthe stress tests in order to understand their \nmagnitude, highlight potential loss           \nconcentrations, and assess and mitigate our   \nexposures where necessary. Limits We use      \ncredit risk limits at various levels, as well \nas underwriting standards to manage the size  \nand nature of our credit exposures. Limits for\nindustries and countries are based on our risk\nappetite and are designed to allow for regular\nmonitoring, review, escalation and management \nof credit risk concentrations. See \u201cOverview  \nand Structure of Risk Management\u201d for         \ninformation about the limit approval process. \nCredit Risk is responsible for monitoring     \nthese limits, and identifying and escalating  \nto senior management and/or the appropriate   \nrisk committee, on a timely basis, instances  \nwhere limits have been exceeded. Risk         \nMitigants To reduce our credit exposures on   \nderivatives and securities financing          \ntransactions, we may enter into netting       \nagreements with counterparties that permit us \nto offset receivables and payables with such  \ncounterparties. We may also reduce credit risk\nwith counterparties by entering into          \nagreements that enable us to obtain collateral\nfrom them on an upfront or contingent basis   \nand/or to terminate transactions if the       \ncounterparty\u2019s credit rating falls below a    \nspecified level. We monitor the fair value of \nthe collateral to ensure that our credit      \nexposures are appropriately collateralized. We\nseek to minimize exposures where there is a   \nsignificant positive correlation between the  \ncreditworthiness of our counterparties and the\nmarket value of collateral we receive. For    \nloans and lending commitments, depending on   \nthe credit quality of the borrower and other  \ncharacteristics of the transaction, we employ \na variety of potential risk mitigants. Risk   \nmitigants include collateral provisions,      \nguarantees, covenants, structural seniority of\nthe bank loan claims and, for certain lending \ncommitments, provisions in the legal          \ndocumentation that allow us to adjust loan    \namounts, pricing, structure and other terms as\nmarket conditions change. The type and        \nstructure of risk mitigants employed can      \nsignificantly influence the degree of credit  \nrisk involved in a loan or lending commitment.\nWhen we do not have sufficient visibility into\na counterparty\u2019s financial strength or when we\nbelieve a counterparty requires support from  \nits parent, we may obtain third-party         \nguarantees of the counterparty\u2019s obligations. \nWe may also mitigate our credit risk using    \ncredit derivatives or participation           \nagreements.                                   \n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    101  \n                                       \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Liquidity pressures prompted the   \nArgentine government to default and           \nrestructure local and foreign obligations in  \n2020. Economic challenges persist and the     \ncountry still needs to secure new financial   \nterms with the IMF. As of December 2020, our  \ntotal credit exposure to Argentina was $164   \nmillion, which was with non-                  \nsovereigncounterparties or borrowers, and was \nprimarily related to loans and lending        \ncommitments. Our total market exposure to     \nArgentina as of December 2020 was not         \nmaterial. The restructuring of Lebanon\u2019s      \nsovereign debt and sharp currency depreciation\nhave led to concerns about its financial and  \npolitical stability. As of December 2020, our \ntotal credit exposure to Lebanon was $196     \nmillion, all of which related to loans and    \nlending commitments with non-                 \nsovereignborrowers. Our total market exposure \nto Lebanon as of December 2020 was not        \nmaterial. Zambia\u2019s sovereign debt default and \nongoing liquidity pressures aggravated by the \nCOVID-19pandemic have led to concerns about   \nZambia\u2019s financial stability. As of December  \n2020, our total credit and market exposure for\nZambia was not material. Venezuela has delayed\npayments on its sovereign debt and its        \npolitical situation remains unclear. As of    \nDecember 2020, our total credit and market    \nexposure for Venezuela was not material. We   \nhave a comprehensive framework to monitor,    \nmeasure and assess our country exposures and  \nto determine our risk appetite.

Item 8. Financial        \nStatements and Supplementary Data Management\u2019s\nReport on Internal Control over Financial     \nReporting Management of The Goldman Sachs     \nGroup, Inc., together with its consolidated   \nsubsidiaries (the firm), is responsible for   \nestablishing and maintaining adequate internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. The firm\u2019s  \ninternal control over financial reporting is a\nprocess designed under the supervision of the \nfirm\u2019s principal executive and principal      \nfinancial officers to provide reasonable      \nassurance regarding the reliability of        \nfinancial reporting and the preparation of the\nfirm\u2019s financial statements for external      \nreporting purposes in accordance with U.S.    \ngenerally accepted accounting principles. As  \nof December 31, 2020, management conducted an \nassessment of the firm\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on the framework    \nestablished in Internal Control \u2014 Integrated  \nFramework (2013)issued by the Committee of    \nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway      \nCommission (COSO). Based on this assessment,  \nmanagement has determined that the firm\u2019s     \ninternal control over financial reporting as  \nof December 31, 2020 was effective. Our       \ninternal control over financial reporting     \nincludes policies and procedures that pertain \nto the maintenance of records that, in        \nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly      \nreflect transactions and dispositions of      \nassets; provide reasonable assurance that     \ntransactions are recorded as necessary to     \npermit preparation of financial statements in \naccordance with U.S. generally accepted       \naccounting principles, and that receipts and  \nexpenditures are being made only in accordance\nwith authorizations of management and the     \ndirectors of the firm; and provide reasonable \nassurance regarding prevention or timely      \ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use or \ndisposition of the firm\u2019s assets that could   \nhave a material effect on our financial       \nstatements.

We  \nalso have audited the Company\u2019s internal      \ncontrol over financial reporting as of        \nDecember 31, 2020, based on criteria          \nestablished in Internal Control \u2014Integrated   \nFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of   \nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway      \nCommission (COSO). In our opinion, the        \nconsolidated financial statements referred to \nabove present fairly, in all material         \nrespects, the financial position of the       \nCompany as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and \nthe results of its operations and its cash    \nflows for each of the three years in the      \nperiod ended December 31, 2020 in conformity  \nwith accounting principles generally accepted \nin the United States of America.

Change in Accounting\nPrinciple As discussed in Note 3 to the       \nconsolidated financial statements, the Company\nchanged the manner in which it accounts for   \ncredit losses on certain financial instruments\nin 2020. Basis for Opinions The Company\u2019s     \nmanagement is responsible for these           \nconsolidated financial statements, for        \nmaintaining effective internal control over   \nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of\nthe effectiveness of internal control over    \nfinancial reporting, included in Management\u2019s \nReport on Internal Control over Financial     \nReporting appearing on page 112. Our          \nresponsibility is to express opinions on the  \nCompany\u2019s consolidated financial statements   \nand on the Company\u2019s internal control over    \nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We   \nare a public accounting firm registered with  \nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board \n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in    \naccordance with the U.S. federal securities   \nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations \nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and \nthe PCAOB. We conducted our audits in         \naccordance with the standards of the PCAOB.   \nThose standards require that we plan and      \nperform the audits to obtain reasonable       \nassurance about whether the consolidated      \nfinancial statements are free of material     \nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud,  \nand whether effective internal control over   \nfinancial reporting was maintained in all     \nmaterial respects. Our audits of the          \nconsolidated financial statements included    \nperforming procedures to assess the risks of  \nmaterial misstatement of the consolidated     \nfinancial statements, whether due to error or \nfraud, and performing procedures that respond \nto those risks. Such procedures included      \nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding\nthe amounts and disclosures in the            \nconsolidated financial statements. Our audits \nalso included evaluating the accounting       \nprinciples used and significant estimates made\nby management, as well as evaluating the      \noverall presentation of the consolidated      \nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal   \ncontrol over financial reporting included     \nobtaining an understanding of internal control\nover financial reporting, assessing the risk  \nthat a material weakness exists, and testing  \nand evaluating the design and operating       \neffectiveness of internal control based on the\nassessed risk. Our audits also included       \nperforming such other procedures as we        \nconsidered necessary in the circumstances.

Because of\nits inherent limitations, internal control    \nover financial reporting may not prevent or   \ndetect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods \nare subject to the risk that controls may     \nbecome inadequate because of changes in       \nconditions, or that the degree of compliance  \nwith the policies or procedures may           \ndeteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The       \ncritical audit matters communicated below are \nmatters arising from the current period audit \nof the consolidated financial statements that \nwere communicated or required to be           \ncommunicated to the audit committee and that  \n(i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are\nmaterial to the consolidated financial        \nstatements and (ii) involved our especially   \nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nThe communication of critical audit matters   \ndoes not alter in any way our opinion on the  \nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a \nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the   \ncritical audit matters below, providing       \nseparate opinions on the critical audit       \nmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to  \nwhich they relate. Valuation of Certain Level \n3 Financial Instruments As described in Notes \n4 through 10 to the consolidated financial    \nstatements, as of December 31, 2020, the      \nCompany carries financial instruments at fair \nvalue, which includes $26.3 billion of        \nfinancial assets and $32.9 billion of         \nfinancial liabilities classified in Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy as one or more inputs\nto the financial instrument\u2019s valuation       \ntechnique are significant and unobservable.   \nSignificant unobservable inputs used by       \nmanagement to value certain of these Level 3  \nfinancial instruments included (i) industry   \nmultiples and public comparables, (ii) credit \nspreadsand (iii) correlation. The principal   \nconsiderations for our determination that     \nperforming procedures relating to the         \nvaluation of certain Level 3 financial        \ninstrumentsis a critical audit matter are (i) \nthe significant judgment by management in     \nvaluing the financial instruments, which in   \nturn led to a high degree of auditor judgment \nand subjectivity in performing procedures     \nrelated to the valuation of certain Level 3   \nfinancial instruments, (ii) a high degree of  \nauditor judgment and effort to evaluate the   \naudit evidence obtained related to the        \naforementioned significant unobservable inputs\nused in the valuation of certain Level 3      \nfinancial instruments, and (iii) the audit    \neffort involved the use of professionals with \nspecialized skill and knowledge. Addressing   \nthe matter involved performing procedures and \nevaluating audit evidence in connection with  \nforming our overall opinion on the            \nconsolidated financial statements. These      \nprocedures included testing the effectiveness \nof controls relating to the valuation of      \nfinancial instruments, including controls over\nthe methods and significant unobservable      \ninputs used in the valuation of certain Level \n3 financial instruments.These procedures also \nincluded, among others, for a sample of       \nfinancial instruments, the involvement of     \nprofessionals with specialized skill and      \nknowledge to assist in (i) developing an      \nindependent estimate of fair value or (ii)    \ntesting management\u2019s process to determine the \nfair value of these financial instruments.    \nDeveloping the independent estimate involved  \n(i) testing the completeness and accuracy of  \ndata provided by management, (ii) evaluating  \nand utilizing management\u2019s significant        \nunobservable inputs or developing independent \nsignificant unobservable inputs, and (iii)    \ncomparing management\u2019s estimate to the        \nindependently developed estimate of fair      \nvalue.

The allowance for   \nwholesale loan losses is measured on a        \ncollective basis for loans that exhibit       \nsimilar risk characteristics using a modeled  \napproach and asset-specific basis for loans   \nthat do not share similar risk                \ncharacteristics. In addition, it includes     \nqualitative components to reflect the         \nuncertain nature of economic forecasting,     \ncapture uncertainty regarding model inputs,   \nand account for model imprecision and         \nconcentration risk. The wholesale models      \ndetermine the probability of default and loss \ngiven default based on various risk factors,  \nincluding internal credit ratings, industry   \ndefault and loss data, expected life,         \nmacroeconomic indicators, the borrower\u2019s      \ncapacity to meet its financial obligations,   \nthe borrower\u2019s country of risk and industry,  \nloan seniority and collateral type. The most  \nsignificant inputs to the forecast model for  \nwholesale loans include forecasted U.S.       \nunemployment rates, GDP, credit spreads,      \ncommercial and industrial delinquency rates,  \nshort- and long-term interest rates, and oil  \nprices. The principal considerations for our  \ndetermination that performing procedures      \nrelating to the allowance for loan losses for \nthe wholesale loan portfolio is a critical    \naudit matter are (i) the significant judgment \nand estimation by management in the           \ndeterminations of internal credit ratings and \nthe forecasted U.S. unemployment rates, which \nin turn led to a high degree of auditor       \njudgment, subjectivity, and effort in         \nperforming procedures and evaluating audit    \nevidence related to management\u2019s              \ndeterminations, and (ii) the audit effort     \ninvolved the use of professionals with        \nspecialized skill and knowledge. Addressing   \nthe matter involved performing procedures and \nevaluating audit evidence in connection with  \nforming our overall opinion on the            \nconsolidated financial statements. These      \nprocedures included testing the effectiveness \nof controls relating to the Company\u2019s         \nallowance for loan losses for the wholesale   \nloan portfolio, including controls over the   \nmodel, certain data, and significant          \nassumptions.These procedures also included,   \namong others, testing management\u2019s process for\nestimating the allowance for loan losses for  \nwholesale loans using a modeled approach,     \nwhich involved evaluating the appropriateness \nof the model and methodology and testing the  \ncompleteness and accuracy of certain data used\nin estimating the allowance for loan losses.  \nThe procedures also included the use of       \nprofessionals with specialized skill and      \nknowledge to assist in evaluating (i) the     \nappropriateness of the model and methodology  \nand (ii) the reasonableness of the internal   \ncredit ratings and the forecasted U.S.        \nunemployment rates used in estimating the     \nallowance for wholesale loan losses. /s/      \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP New York, New York \nFebruary 19, 2021 We have served as the       \nCompany\u2019s auditor since 1922.                 \n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    115  \n                                       \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by\nfirst evaluating whether the entity is a      \nvoting interest entity or a variable interest \nentity (VIE). Voting Interest Entities. Voting\ninterest entities are entities in which (i)   \nthe total equity investment at risk is        \nsufficient to enable the entity to finance its\nactivities independently and (ii) the equity  \nholders have the power to direct the          \nactivities of the entity that most            \nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nthe obligation to absorb the losses of the    \nentity and the right to receive the residual  \nreturns of the entity. The usual condition for\na controlling financial interest in a voting  \ninterest entity is ownership of a majority    \nvoting interest. If the firm has a controlling\nmajority voting interest in a voting interest \nentity, the entity is consolidated. Variable  \nInterest Entities. A VIE is an entity that    \nlacks one or more of the characteristics of a \nvoting interest entity. The firm has a        \ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE when  \nthe firm has a variable interest or interests \nthat provide it with (i) the power to direct  \nthe activities of the VIE that most           \nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic       \nperformance and (ii) the obligation to absorb \nlosses of the VIE or the right to receive     \nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially  \nbe significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for    \nfurther information about VIEs. Equity-Method \nInvestments. When the firm does not have a    \ncontrolling financial interest in an entity   \nbut can exert significant influence over the  \nentity\u2019s operating and financial policies, the\ninvestment is generally accounted for at fair \nvalue by electing the fair value option       \navailable under U.S. GAAP. Significant        \ninfluence generally exists when the firm owns \n20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock or in-\nsubstancecommon stock. In certain cases, the  \nfirm applies the equity method of accounting  \nto new investments that are strategic in      \nnature or closely related to the firm\u2019s       \nprincipal business activities, when the firm  \nhas a significant degree of involvement in the\ncash flows or operations of the investee or   \nwhen cost-benefit considerations are less     \nsignificant. See Note 8 for further           \ninformation about equity-method investments.  \n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    121  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \nInvestment Funds. The firm has formed         \ninvestment funds with third-party investors.  \nThese funds are typically organized as limited\npartnerships or limited liability companies   \nfor which the firm acts as general partner or \nmanager. Generally, the firm does not hold a  \nmajority of the economic interests in these   \nfunds. These funds are usually voting interest\nentities and generally are not consolidated   \nbecause third-party investors typically have  \nrights to terminate the funds or to remove the\nfirm as general partner or manager.           \nInvestments in these funds are generally      \nmeasured at net asset value (NAV) and are     \nincluded in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and  \n22 for further information about investments  \nin funds. Use of Estimates Preparation of     \nthese consolidated financial statements       \nrequires management to make certain estimates \nand assumptions, the most important of which  \nrelate to fair value measurements, the        \nallowance for credit losses on loans and      \nlending commitments accounted for at amortized\ncost, accounting for goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets, provisions for losses that \nmay arise from litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings (including governmental           \ninvestigations), and provisions for losses    \nthat may arise from tax audits. These         \nestimates and assumptions are based on the    \nbest available information but actual results \ncould be materially different. Revenue        \nRecognition Financial Assets and Liabilities  \nat Fair Value. Trading assets and liabilities \nand certain investments are recorded at fair  \nvalue either under the fair value option or in\naccordance with other U.S. GAAP. In addition, \nthe firm has elected to account for certain of\nits loans and other financial assets and      \nliabilities at fair value by electing the fair\nvalue option. The fair value of a financial   \ninstrument is the amount that would be        \nreceived to sell an asset or paid to transfer \na liability in an orderly transaction between \nmarket participants at the measurement date.  \nFinancial assets are marked to bid prices and \nfinancial liabilities are marked to offer     \nprices. Fair value measurements do not include\ntransaction costs. Fair value gains or losses \nare generally included in market making or    \nother principal transactions. See Note 4 for  \nfurther information about fair value          \nmeasurements. Revenue from Contracts with     \nClients. The firm recognizes revenue earned   \nfrom contracts with clients for services, such\nas investment banking, investment management, \nand execution and clearing (contracts with    \nclients), when the performance obligations    \nrelated to the underlying transaction are     \ncompleted. Revenues from contracts with       \nclients represent approximately 45% of total  \nnon-interestrevenues for 2020 (including      \napproximately 90% of investment banking       \nrevenues, approximately 95% of investment     \nmanagement revenues and all commissions and   \nfees), and approximately 45% of total non-    \ninterestrevenues for 2019 (including          \napproximately 85% of investment banking       \nrevenues, approximately 95% of investment     \nmanagement revenues and all commissions and   \nfees ). See Note 25 for information about net \nrevenues by business segment. Investment      \nBanking Advisory. Fees from financial advisory\nassignments are recognized in revenues when   \nthe services related to the underlying        \ntransaction are completed under the terms of  \nthe assignment. Non-refundabledeposits and    \nmilestone payments in connection with         \nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized \nin revenues upon completion of the underlying \ntransaction or when the assignment is         \notherwise concluded. Expenses associated with \nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized \nwhen incurred and are included in transaction \nbased expenses. Client reimbursements for such\nexpenses are included in investment banking   \nrevenues. Underwriting. Fees from underwriting\nassignments are recognized in revenues upon   \ncompletion of the underlying transaction based\non the terms of the assignment. Expenses      \nassociated with underwriting assignments are  \ngenerally deferred until the related revenue  \nis recognized or the assignment is otherwise  \nconcluded. Such expenses are included in      \ntransaction based expenses for completed      \nassignments.                                  \n                                       \n  122    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \nInvestment Management The firm earns          \nmanagement fees and incentive fees for        \ninvestment management services, which are     \nincluded in investment management revenues.   \nThe firm makes payments to brokers and        \nadvisors related to the placement of the      \nfirm\u2019s investment funds (distribution fees),  \nwhich are included in transaction based       \nexpenses. Management Fees. Management fees for\nmutual funds are calculated as a percentage of\ndaily net asset value and are received        \nmonthly. Management fees for hedge funds and  \nseparately managed accounts are calculated as \na percentage of month-endnet asset value and  \nare generally received quarterly. Management  \nfees for private equity funds are calculated  \nas a percentage of monthly invested capital or\ncommitted capital and are received quarterly, \nsemi-annually or annually, depending on the   \nfund. Management fees are recognized over time\nin the period the services are provided.      \nDistribution fees paid by the firm are        \ncalculated based on either a percentage of the\nmanagement fee, the investment fund\u2019s net     \nasset value or the committed capital. Such    \nfees are included in transaction based        \nexpenses. Incentive Fees. Incentive fees are  \ncalculated as a percentage of a fund\u2019s or     \nseparately managed account\u2019s return, or excess\nreturn above a specified benchmark or other   \nperformance target. Incentive fees are        \ngenerally based on investment performance over\na twelve-month period or over the life of a   \nfund. Fees that are based on performance over \na twelve-month period are subject to          \nadjustment prior to the end of the measurement\nperiod. For fees that are based on investment \nperformance over the life of the fund, future \ninvestment underperformance may require fees  \npreviously distributed to the firm to be      \nreturned to the fund. Incentive fees earned   \nfrom a fund or separately managed account are \nrecognized when it is probable that a         \nsignificant reversal of such fees will not    \noccur, which is generally when such fees are  \nno longer subject to fluctuations in the      \nmarket value of investments held by the fund  \nor separately managed account. Therefore,     \nincentive fees recognized during the period   \nmay relate to performance obligations         \nsatisfied in previous periods. Commissions and\nFees The firm earns commissions and fees from \nexecuting and clearing client transactions on \nstock, options and futures markets, as well as\nover-the-counter(OTC) transactions.           \nCommissions and fees are recognized on the day\nthe trade is executed. The firm also provides \nthird-party research services to clients in   \nconnection with certain soft-dollar           \narrangements. Third-party research costs      \nincurred by the firm in connection with such  \narrangements are presented net within         \ncommissions and fees. Remaining Performance   \nObligations Remaining performance obligations \nare services that the firm has committed to   \nperform in the future in connection with its  \ncontracts with clients. The firm\u2019s remaining  \nperformance obligations are generally related \nto its financial advisory assignments and     \ncertain investment management activities.     \nRevenues associated with remaining performance\nobligations relating to financial advisory    \nassignments cannot be determined until the    \noutcome of the transaction. For the firm\u2019s    \ninvestment management activities, where fees  \nare calculated based on the net asset value of\nthe fund or separately managed account, future\nrevenues associated with such remaining       \nperformance obligations cannot be determined  \nas such fees are subject to fluctuations in   \nthe market value of investments held by the   \nfund or separately managed account. The firm  \nis able to determine the future revenues      \nassociated with management fees calculated    \nbased on committed capital. As of December    \n2020, substantially all future net revenues   \nassociated with such remaining performance    \nobligations will be recognized through 2028.  \nAnnual revenues associated with such          \nperformance obligations average less than $   \n250million through 2028. Transfers of         \nFinancial Assets Transfers of financial assets\nare accounted for as sales when the firm has  \nrelinquished control over the assets          \ntransferred. For transfers of financial assets\naccounted for as sales, any gains or losses   \nare recognized in net revenues. Assets or     \nliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s        \ncontinuing involvement with transferred       \nfinancial assets are initially recognized at  \nfair value. For transfers of financial assets \nthat are not accounted for as sales, the      \nassets are generally included in trading      \nassets and the transfer is accounted for as a \ncollateralized financing, with the related    \ninterest expense recognized over the life of  \nthe transaction. See Note 11 for further      \ninformation about transfers of financial      \nassets accounted for as collateralized        \nfinancings and Note 16 for further information\nabout transfers of financial assets accounted \nfor as sales.                                 \n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    123  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \nCash and Cash Equivalents The firm defines    \ncash equivalents as highly liquid overnight   \ndeposits held in the ordinary course of       \nbusiness. Cash and cash equivalents included  \ncash and due from banks of $ 11.95billion as  \nof December 2020 and $ 12.57billion as of     \nDecember 2019. Cash and cash equivalents also \nincluded interest-bearing deposits with banks \nof $ 143.89billion as of December 2020 and $  \n120.98billion as of December 2019. The firm   \nsegregates cash for regulatory and other      \npurposes related to client activity. Cash and \ncash equivalents segregated for regulatory and\nother purposes were $ 24.52billion as of      \nDecember 2020 and $ 22.78billion as of        \nDecember 2019. In addition, the firm          \nsegregates securities for regulatory and other\npurposes related to client activity. See Note \n11 for further information about segregated   \nsecurities. Customer and Other Receivables    \nCustomer and other receivables included       \nreceivables from customers and counterparties \nof $ 82.39billion as of December 2020 and $   \n50.90billion as of December 2019, and         \nreceivables from brokers, dealers and clearing\norganizations of $ 38.94billion as of December\n2020 and $ 23.71billion as of December 2019.  \nSuch receivables primarily consist of customer\nmargin loans, receivables resulting from      \nunsettled transactions and collateral posted  \nin connection with certain derivative         \ntransactions. Substantially all of these      \nreceivables are accounted for at amortized    \ncost net of any allowance for credit losses,  \nwhich generally approximates fair value. As   \nthese receivables are not accounted for at    \nfair value, they are not included in the      \nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through\n10. Had these receivables been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, substantially all\nwould have been classified in level 2 as of   \nboth December 2020 and December 2019. See Note\n10 for further information about customer and \nother receivables accounted for at fair value \nunder the fair value option. Interest on      \ncustomer and other receivables is recognized  \nover the life of the transaction and included \nin interest income. Customer and other        \nreceivables includes receivables from         \ncontracts with clients and contract assets.   \nContract assets represent the firm\u2019s right to \nreceive consideration for services provided in\nconnection with its contracts with clients for\nwhich collection is conditional and not merely\nsubject to the passage of time. The firm\u2019s    \nreceivables from contracts with clients were $\n2.60billion as of December 2020 and $         \n2.27billion as of December 2019. As of both   \nDecember 2020 and December 2019 contract      \nassets were not material. Customer and Other  \nPayables Customer and other payables included \npayables to customers and counterparties of $ \n183.57billion as of December 2020 and $       \n170.21billion as of December 2019, and        \npayables to brokers, dealers and clearing     \norganizations of $ 7.09billion as of December \n2020 and $ 4.61billion as of December 2019.   \nSuch payables primarily consist of customer   \ncredit balances related to the firm\u2019s prime   \nbrokerage activities. Customer and other      \npayables are accounted for at cost plus       \naccrued interest, which generally approximates\nfair value. As these payables are not         \naccounted for at fair value, they are not     \nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in\nNotes 4 through 10. Had these payables been   \nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy,  \nsubstantially all would have been classified  \nin level 2 as of both December 2020 and       \nDecember 2019. Interest on customer and other \npayables is recognized over the life of the   \ntransaction and included in interest expense. \nOffsetting Assets and Liabilities To reduce   \ncredit exposures on derivatives and securities\nfinancing transactions, the firm may enter    \ninto master netting agreements or similar     \narrangements (collectively, netting           \nagreements) with counterparties that permit it\nto offset receivables and payables with such  \ncounterparties. A netting agreement is a      \ncontract with a counterparty that permits net \nsettlement of multiple transactions with that \ncounterparty, including upon the exercise of  \ntermination rights by a non-defaultingparty.  \nUpon exercise of such termination rights, all \ntransactions governed by the netting agreement\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is \ncalculated. In addition, the firm receives and\nposts cash and securities collateral with     \nrespect to its derivatives and securities     \nfinancing transactions, subject to the terms  \nof the related credit support agreements or   \nsimilar arrangements (collectively, credit    \nsupport agreements). An enforceable credit    \nsupport agreement grants the non-             \ndefaultingparty exercising termination rights \nthe right to liquidate the collateral and     \napply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In    \norder to assess enforceability of the firm\u2019s  \nright of setoff under netting and credit      \nsupport agreements, the firm evaluates various\nfactors, including applicable bankruptcy laws,\nlocal statutes and regulatory provisions in   \nthe jurisdiction of the parties to the        \nagreement.                                    \n                                       \n  124    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In the consolidated balance sheets,\nresale and repurchase agreements, and         \nsecurities borrowed and loaned, are not       \nreported net of the related cash and          \nsecurities received or posted as collateral.  \nSee Note 11 for further information about     \ncollateral received and pledged, including    \nrights to deliver or repledge collateral.

Recent Accounting Developments Leases \n(ASC 842). In February 2016, the FASB issued  \nASU No. 2016-02,\u201cLeases (Topic 842).\u201d This ASU\nrequires that, for leases longer than one     \nyear, a lessee recognize in the balance sheet \na right-of-useasset, representing the right to\nuse the underlying asset for the lease term,  \nand a lease liability, representing the       \nliability to make lease payments. It also     \nrequires that for finance leases, a lessee    \nrecognize interest expense on the lease       \nliability, separately from the amortization of\nthe right-of-useasset in the statements of    \nearnings, while for operating leases, such    \namounts should be recognized as a combined    \nexpense. It also requires that for qualifying \nsale-leaseback transactions the seller        \nrecognize any gain or loss (based on the      \nestimated fair value of the asset at the time \nof sale) when control of the asset is         \ntransferred instead of amortizing it over the \nlease period. In addition, this ASU requires  \nexpanded disclosures about the nature and     \nterms of lease agreements. The firm adopted   \nthis ASU in January 2019 under a modified     \nretrospective approach. Upon adoption, in     \naccordance with the ASU, the firm elected to  \nnot reassess the lease classification or      \ninitial direct costs of existing leases, and  \nto not reassess whether existing contracts    \ncontain a lease. In addition, the firm has    \nelected to account for each contract\u2019s lease  \nand non-leasecomponents as a single lease     \ncomponent. The impact of adoption was a gross \nup of $ 1.77billion on the firm\u2019s consolidated\nbalance sheet and an increase to retained     \nearnings of $ 12million (net of tax) as of    \nJanuary 1, 2019. Measurement of Credit Losses \non Financial Instruments (ASC 326). In June   \n2016, the FASB issued ASU No.                 \n2016-13,\u201cFinancial Instruments \u2014 Credit Losses\n(Topic 326) \u2014 Measurement of Credit Losses on \nFinancial Instruments.\u201d This ASU amends       \nseveral aspects of the measurement of credit  \nlosses on certain financial instruments,      \nincluding replacing the existing incurred     \ncredit loss model and other models with the   \nCurrent Expected Credit Losses (CECL) model   \nand amending certain aspects of accounting for\npurchased financial assets with deterioration \nin credit quality since origination. The firm \nadopted this ASU in January 2020 under a      \nmodified retrospective approach. As a result  \nof adopting this ASU, the firm\u2019s allowance for\ncredit losses on financial assets and         \ncommitments that are measured at amortized    \ncost reflects management\u2019s estimate of credit \nlosses over the remaining expected life of    \nsuch assets. Expected credit losses for newly \nrecognized financial assets and commitments,  \nas well as changes to expected credit losses  \nduring the period, are recognized in earnings.\nThese expected credit losses are measured     \nbased on historical experience, current       \nconditions and forecasts that affect the      \ncollectability of the reported amount. The    \ncumulative effect of measuring the allowance  \nunder CECL as a result of adopting this ASU as\nof January 1, 2020 was an increase in the     \nallowance for credit losses of $ 848million.  \nThe increase in the allowance is driven by the\nfact that the allowance under CECL covers     \nexpected credit losses over the full expected \nlife of the loan portfolios and also takes    \ninto account forecasts of expected future     \neconomic conditions. In addition, in          \naccordance with the ASU, the firm elected the \nfair value option for loans that were         \npreviously accounted for as Purchased Credit  \nImpaired (PCI), which resulted in a decrease  \nto the allowance for PCI loans of $           \n169million. The cumulative effect of adopting \nthis ASU was a decrease to retained earnings  \nof $ 638million (net of tax).                 \n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    125  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate \nReform on Financial Reporting (ASC 848). In   \nMarch 2020, the FASB issued ASU No.           \n2020-04,\u201cReference Rate Reform \u2014 Facilitation \nof the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on    \nFinancial Reporting.\u201d This ASU provides       \noptional relief from applying generally       \naccepted accounting principles to contracts,  \nhedging relationships and other transactions  \naffected by reference rate reform. In         \naddition, in January 2021 the FASB issued ASU \nNo. 2021-01 \u201cReference Rate Reform \u2014 Scope,\u201d  \nwhich clarified the scope of ASC 848 relating \nto contract modifications. The firm adopted   \nthese ASUs upon issuance and elected to apply \nthe relief available to certain modified      \nderivatives. The adoption of these ASUs did   \nnot have a material impact on the firm\u2019s      \nconsolidated financial statements. Note 4.    \nFair Value Measurements The fair value of a   \nfinancial instrument is the amount that would \nbe received to sell an asset or paid to       \ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Financial assets are marked to bid      \nprices and financial liabilities are marked to\noffer prices. Fair value measurements do not  \ninclude transaction costs. The firm measures  \ncertain financial assets and liabilities as a \nportfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to \nmarket and/or credit risks). The best evidence\nof fair value is a quoted price in an active  \nmarket. If quoted prices in active markets are\nnot available, fair value is determined by    \nreference to prices for similar instruments,  \nquoted prices or recent transactions in less  \nactive markets, or internally developed models\nthat primarily use market-based or            \nindependently sourced inputs, including, but  \nnot limited to, interest rates, volatilities, \nequity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates,\ncommodity prices, credit spreads and funding  \nspreads (i.e., the spread or difference       \nbetween the interest rate at which a borrower \ncould finance a given financial instrument    \nrelative to a benchmark interest rate). U.S.  \nGAAP has a three-level hierarchy for          \ndisclosure of fair value measurements. This   \nhierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation \ntechniques used to measure fair value, giving \nthe highest priority to level 1 inputs and the\nlowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial\ninstrument\u2019s level in this hierarchy is based \non the lowest level of input that is          \nsignificant to its fair value measurement. In \nevaluating the significance of a valuation    \ninput, the firm considers, among other        \nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to   \nthat input. The fair value hierarchy is as    \nfollows: Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets to which the firm had\naccess at the measurement date for identical, \nunrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2.  \nInputs to valuation techniques are observable,\neither directly or indirectly. Level 3. One or\nmore inputs to valuation techniques are       \nsignificant and unobservable. The fair values \nfor substantially all of the firm\u2019s financial \nassets and liabilities are based on observable\nprices and inputs and are classified in levels\n1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain  \nlevel 2 and level 3 financial assets and      \nliabilities may require valuation adjustments \nthat a market participant would require to    \narrive at fair value for factors, such as     \ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality,   \nfunding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity\nand bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments  \nare generally based on market evidence. The   \nvaluation techniques and nature of significant\ninputs used to determine the fair value of the\nfirm\u2019s financial instruments are described    \nbelow. See Notes 5 through 10 for further     \ninformation about significant unobservable    \ninputs used to value level 3 financial        \ninstruments. Valuation Techniques and         \nSignificant Inputs for Trading Cash           \nInstruments, Investments and Loans Level 1.   \nLevel 1 instruments include U.S. government   \nobligations, most non-U.S.government          \nobligations, certain agency obligations,      \ncertain corporate debt instruments, certain   \nmoney market instruments and actively traded  \nlisted equities. These instruments are valued \nusing quoted prices for identical unrestricted\ninstruments in active markets. The firm       \ndefines active markets for equity instruments \nbased on the average daily trading volume both\nin absolute terms and relative to the market  \ncapitalization for the instrument. The firm   \ndefines active markets for debt instruments   \nbased on both the average daily trading volume\nand the number of days with trading activity. \nLevel 2. Level 2 instruments include certain  \nnon-U.S.government obligations, most agency   \nobligations, most mortgage-backed loans and   \nsecurities, most corporate debt instruments,  \nmost state and municipal obligations, most    \nmoney market instruments, most other debt     \nobligations, restricted or less liquid listed \nequities, certain private equities,           \ncommodities and certain lending commitments.  \nValuations of level 2 instruments can be      \nverified to quoted prices, recent trading     \nactivity for identical or similar instruments,\nbroker or dealer quotations or alternative    \npricing sources with reasonable levels of     \nprice transparency. Consideration is given to \nthe nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative\nor firm) and the relationship of recent market\nactivity to the prices provided from          \nalternative pricing sources.                  \n                                       \n  126    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Price\ntransparency of\nderivatives can\ngenerally be\ncharacterized by\nproduct type, as\ndescribed below.\n                                              \n       Interest Rate.In general, the key      \n       inputs used to value interest rate     \n       derivatives are transparent, even for  \n       most long-dated contracts. Interest    \n       rate swaps and options denominated in  \n       the currencies of leading              \n       industrialized nations are             \n  \u2022    characterized by high trading volumes  \n       and tight bid/offer spreads. Interest  \n       rate derivatives that reference        \n       indices, such as an inflation index,   \n       or the shape of the yield curve        \n       (e.g.,10-yearswap rate vs.2-yearswap   \n       rate) are more complex, but the key    \n       inputs are generally observable.       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit.Price transparency for credit   \n       default swaps, including both single   \n       names and baskets of credits, varies   \n       by market and underlying reference     \n       entity or obligation. Credit default   \n       swaps that reference indices, large    \n       corporates and major sovereigns        \n       generally exhibit the most price       \n       transparency. For credit default       \n       swaps with other underliers, price     \n       transparency varies based on credit    \n       rating, the cost of borrowing the      \n       underlying reference obligations, and  \n  \u2022    the availability of the underlying     \n       reference obligations for delivery     \n       upon the default of the issuer.        \n       Credit default swaps that reference    \n       loans, asset-backed securities and     \n       emerging market debt instruments tend  \n       to have less price transparency than   \n       those that reference corporate bonds.  \n       In addition, more complex credit       \n       derivatives, such as those sensitive   \n       to the correlation between two or      \n       more underlying reference              \n       obligations, generally have less       \n       price transparency.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Currency.Prices for currency           \n       derivatives based on the exchange      \n       rates of leading industrialized        \n       nations, including those with longer   \n       tenors, are generally transparent.     \n  \u2022    The primary difference between the     \n       price transparency of developed and    \n       emerging market currency derivatives   \n       is that emerging markets tend to be    \n       only observable for contracts with     \n       shorter tenors.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Commodity.Commodity derivatives        \n       include transactions referenced to     \n       energy (e.g., oil and natural gas),    \n       metals (e.g., precious and base) and   \n       soft commodities (e.g.,                \n       agricultural). Price transparency      \n       varies based on the underlying         \n  \u2022    commodity, delivery location, tenor    \n       and product quality (e.g., diesel      \n       fuel compared to unleaded gasoline).   \n       In general, price transparency for     \n       commodity derivatives is greater for   \n       contracts with shorter tenors and      \n       contracts that are more closely        \n       aligned with major and/or benchmark    \n       commodity indices.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Equity.Price transparency for equity   \n       derivatives varies by market and       \n       underlier. Options on indices and the  \n       common stock of corporates included    \n       in major equity indices exhibit the    \n       most price transparency. Equity        \n       derivatives generally have observable  \n  \u2022    market prices, except for contracts    \n       with long tenors or reference prices   \n       that differ significantly from         \n       current market prices. More complex    \n       equity derivatives, such as those      \n       sensitive to the correlation between   \n       two or more individual stocks,         \n       generally have less price              \n       transparency.                          \n                                              \nLiquidity is essential\nto observability of all\nproduct types.

Due to the          \n       distinctive nature of each level\u00a03     \n       trading cash instrument, the           \n       interrelationship of inputs is not     \n       necessarily uniform within each        \n       product type.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Trading cash instruments are valued    \n       using discounted cash flows.           \n                                              \nLevel 3 Rollforward                           \nThe table below\npresents a summary of\nthe changes in fair\nvalue for level 3\ntrading cash\ninstruments.\n                                              \n                  Year\u00a0Ended                  \n  $ in\u00a0             December                  \n  millions              2020         2019     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Total                                       \n  trading                                     \n  cash                                        \n  instrument                                  \n  assets                                      \n  Beginning           $1,242       $1,689     \n  balance                                     \n  Net                                         \n  realized                66           89     \n  gains/(lo\u2026                                  \n  Net                                         \n  unrealized            (143  )       (35  )  \n  gains/(lo\u2026                                  \n  Purchases              796          522     \n  Sales                 (411  )      (885  )  \n  Settlemen\u2026            (266  )      (252  )  \n  Transfers                                   \n  into level             156          256     \n  3                                           \n  Transfers                                   \n  out of                (203  )      (142  )  \n  level\u00a03                                     \n  Ending              $1,237       $1,242     \n  balance                                     \n  Total                                       \n  trading                                     \n  cash                                        \n  instrument                                  \n  liabiliti\u2026                                  \n  Beginning            $(273  )            )  \n  balance                                     \n  Net                                         \n  realized                 \u2013           10     \n  gains/(lo\u2026                                  \n  Net                                         \n  unrealized             (15  )      (236  )  \n  gains/(lo\u2026                                  \n  Purchases               34           56     \n  Sales                  (38  )       (35  )  \n  Settlemen\u2026               9            \u2013     \n  Transfers                                   \n  into level             (27  )       (24  )  \n  3                                           \n  Transfers                                   \n  out of                 230            5     \n  level\u00a03                                     \n  Ending                $(80  )            )  \n  balance                                     \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n                                              \n       Changes in fair value are presented    \n  \u2022    for all trading cash instruments that  \n       are classified in level\u00a03 as of the    \n       end of the period.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates  \n  \u2022    to trading cash instruments that were  \n       still held atperiod-end.               \n                                              \n                                              \n       Transfers between levels of the fair   \n       value hierarchy are reported at the    \n       beginning of the reporting period in   \n  \u2022    which they occur.

The drivers of   \nnet unrealized losses on level 3 trading cash \ninstrument assets for 2019 were not material. \nTransfers into level 3 trading cash instrument\nassets during 2019 primarily reflected        \ntransfers of certain corporate debt           \ninstruments from level 2, principally due to  \nreduced price transparency as a result of a   \nlack of market evidence, including fewer      \nmarket transactions in these instruments. The \ndrivers of transfers out of level 3 trading   \ncash instrument assets during 2019 were not   \nmaterial. Note 7. Derivatives and Hedging     \nActivities Derivative Activities Derivatives  \nare instruments that derive their value from  \nunderlying asset prices, indices, reference   \nrates and other inputs, or a combination of   \nthese factors. Derivatives may be traded on an\nexchange (exchange-traded) or they may be     \nprivately negotiated contracts, which are     \nusually referred to as OTC derivatives.       \nCertain of the firm\u2019s OTC derivatives are     \ncleared and settled through central clearing  \ncounterparties (OTC-cleared),while others are \nbilateral contracts between two counterparties\n(bilateral OTC). Market Making. As a market   \nmaker, the firm enters into derivative        \ntransactions to provide liquidity to clients  \nand to facilitate the transfer and hedging of \ntheir risks. In this role, the firm typically \nacts as principal and is required to commit   \ncapital to provide execution, and maintains   \nmarket-making positions in response to, or in \nanticipation of, client demand.               \n                                       \n  134    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\nfirm also enters into\nderivatives to\nactively manage risk\nexposures that arise\nfrom its market-making\nand investing and\nfinancing activities.\nThe firm\u2019s holdings\nand exposures are\nhedged, in many cases,\non either a portfolio\nor risk-specific\nbasis, as opposed to\nan instrument-by-\ninstrumentbasis. The\noffsetting impact of\nthis economic hedging\nis reflected in the\nsame business segment\nas the related\nrevenues. In addition,\nthe firm may enter\ninto derivatives\ndesignated as hedges\nunder U.S. GAAP. These\nderivatives are used\nto manage interest\nrate exposure of\ncertain fixed-rate\nunsecured borrowings\nand deposits, as well\nas to manage foreign\nexchange risk of\ncertain available-for-\nsalesecurities and the\nnet investment in\ncertain\nnon-U.S.operations.\n\nThe firm enters into\nvarious types of\nderivatives,\nincluding:\n                                              \n       Futures and Forwards.Contracts that    \n       commit counterparties to purchase or   \n  \u2022    sell financial instruments,            \n       commodities or currencies in the       \n       future.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Swaps.Contracts that require           \n       counterparties to exchange cash        \n       flows, such as currency or interest    \n       payment streams. The amounts           \n  \u2022    exchanged are based on the specific    \n       terms of the contract with reference   \n       to specified rates, financial          \n       instruments, commodities, currencies   \n       or indices.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Options.Contracts in which the option  \n       purchaser has the right, but not the   \n       obligation, to purchase from or sell   \n  \u2022    to the option writer financial         \n       instruments, commodities or            \n       currencies within a defined time       \n       period for a specified price.          \n                                              \nDerivatives are\nreported on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis\n(i.e., the net payable\nor receivable for\nderivative assets and\nliabilities for a\ngiven counterparty)\nwhen a legal right of\nsetoff exists under an\nenforceable netting\nagreement\n(counterparty\nnetting).

The drivers of   \nboth transfers into level 3 derivatives and   \ntransfers out of level 3 derivatives during   \n2020 were not material. Year Ended December   \n2019.

The net         \nunrealized losses on level 3 derivatives for  \n2019 were primarily attributable to losses on \ncertain equity derivatives (primarily         \nreflecting the impact of an increase in equity\nprices), and losses on certain currency       \nderivatives (primarily reflecting the impact  \nof a decrease in interest rates and changes in\nforeign exchange rates), partially offset by  \ngains on certain credit derivatives (primarily\nreflecting the impact of a decrease in        \ninterest rates), gains on certain commodity   \nderivatives (primarily reflecting the impact  \nof changes in commodity prices), and gains on \ncertain interest rate derivatives (primarily  \nreflecting the impact of a decrease in        \ninterest rates). The drivers of transfers into\nlevel 3 derivatives during 2019 were not      \nmaterial. Transfers out of level 3 derivatives\nduring 2019 primarily reflected transfers of  \ncertain equity derivative assets to level 2,  \nprincipally due to certain unobservable inputs\nno longer being significant to the valuation  \nof these derivatives.                         \n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    139  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Credit\nderivatives are\nactively managed based\non the firm\u2019s net risk\nposition. Credit\nderivatives are\ngenerally individually\nnegotiated contracts\nand can have various\nsettlement and payment\nconventions. Credit\nevents include failure\nto pay, bankruptcy,\nacceleration of\nindebtedness,\nrestructuring,\nrepudiation and\ndissolution of the\nreference entity.\n\nThe firm enters into\nthe following types of\ncredit derivatives:\n                                              \n       Credit Default Swaps.Single-name       \n       credit default swaps protect the       \n       buyer against the loss of principal    \n       on one or more bonds, loans or         \n       mortgages (reference obligations) in   \n       the event the issuer of the reference  \n       obligations suffers a credit event.    \n       The buyer of protection pays an        \n       initial or periodic premium to the     \n  \u2022    seller and receives protection for     \n       the period of the contract. If there   \n       is no credit event, as defined in the  \n       contract, the seller of protection     \n       makes no payments to the buyer. If a   \n       credit event occurs, the seller of     \n       protection is required to make a       \n       payment to the buyer, calculated       \n       according to the terms of the          \n       contract.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit Options.In a credit option,     \n       the option writer assumes the          \n       obligation to purchase or sell a       \n       reference obligation at a specified    \n       price or credit spread. The option     \n       purchaser buys the right, but does     \n  \u2022    not assume the obligation, to sell     \n       the reference obligation to, or        \n       purchase it from, the option writer.   \n       The payments on credit options depend  \n       either on a particular credit spread   \n       or the price of the reference          \n       obligation.                            \n                                              \n                                       \n  140    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n                                              \n       Credit Indices, Baskets and            \n       Tranches.Credit derivatives may        \n       reference a basket of single-name      \n       credit default swaps or a broad-based  \n       index. If a credit event occurs in     \n       one of the underlying reference        \n       obligations, the protection seller     \n       pays the protection buyer. The         \n       payment is typically apro-rataportion  \n       of the transaction\u2019s total notional    \n  \u2022    amount based on the underlying         \n       defaulted reference obligation. In     \n       certain transactions, the credit risk  \n       of a basket or index is separated      \n       into various portions (tranches),      \n       each having different levels of        \n       subordination. The most junior         \n       tranches cover initial defaults and    \n       once losses exceed the notional        \n       amount of these junior tranches, any   \n       excess loss is covered by the next     \n       most senior tranche.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Total Return Swaps.A total return      \n       swap transfers the risks relating to   \n       economic performance of a reference    \n       obligation from the protection buyer   \n       to the protection seller. Typically,   \n       the protection buyer receives a        \n  \u2022    floating rate of interest and          \n       protection against any reduction in    \n       fair value of the reference            \n       obligation, and the protection seller  \n       receives the cash flows associated     \n       with the reference obligation, plus    \n       any increase in the fair value of the  \n       reference obligation.                  \n                                              \nThe firm economically\nhedges its exposure to\nwritten credit\nderivatives primarily\nby entering into\noffsetting purchased\ncredit derivatives\nwith identical\nunderliers.\nSubstantially all of\nthe firm\u2019s purchased\ncredit derivative\ntransactions are with\nfinancial institutions\nand are subject to\nstringent collateral\nthresholds. In\naddition, upon the\noccurrence of a\nspecified trigger\nevent, the firm may\ntake possession of the\nreference obligations\nunderlying a\nparticular written\ncredit derivative, and\nconsequently may, upon\nliquidation of the\nreference obligations,\nrecover amounts on the\nunderlying reference\nobligations in the\nevent of default.\n\nAs of December 2020,\nwritten credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n515.85billion and\npurchased credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n558.18billion, for\ntotal net notional\npurchased protection\nof $ 42.33billion.

These interest\nrate swaps hedge\nchanges in fair value\nattributable to the\ndesignated benchmark\ninterest rate (e.g.,\nLondon Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR),\nSecured Overnight\nFinancing Rate or\nOvernight Index Swap\nRate), effectively\nconverting a\nsubstantial portion of\nfixed-rate obligations\ninto floating-rate\nobligations.\nThe firm applies a\nstatistical method that\nutilizes regression\nanalysis when assessing\nthe effectiveness of\nthese hedging\nrelationships in\nachieving offsetting\nchanges in the fair\nvalues of the hedging\ninstrument and the risk\nbeing hedged (i.e.,\ninterest rate risk). An\ninterest rate swap is\nconsidered highly\neffective in offsetting\nchanges in fair value\nattributable to changes\nin the hedged risk when\nthe regression analysis\nresults in a\ncoefficient of\ndetermination of 80% or\ngreater and a slope\nbetween 80% and 125%.\n                                       \n  142    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Private equity funds   \nprimarily invest in a broad range of          \nindustries worldwide, including leveraged     \nbuyouts, recapitalizations, growth investments\nand distressed investments. Credit funds      \ngenerally invest in loans and other fixed     \nincome instruments and are focused on         \nproviding private high-yield capital for      \nleveraged and management buyout transactions, \nrecapitalizations, financings, refinancings,  \nacquisitions and restructurings for private   \nequity firms, private family companies and    \ncorporate issuers. Real estate funds invest   \nglobally, primarily in real estate companies, \nloan portfolios, debt recapitalizations and   \nproperty. Private equity, credit and real     \nestate funds are closed-endfunds in which the \nfirm\u2019s investments are generally not eligible \nfor redemption. Distributions will be received\nfrom these funds as the underlying assets are \nliquidated or distributed, the timing of which\nis uncertain. The firm also invests in hedge  \nfunds, primarily multi-disciplinary hedge     \nfunds that employ a fundamental bottom-       \nupinvestment approach across various asset    \nclasses and strategies. The firm\u2019s investments\nin hedge funds primarily include interests    \nwhere the underlying assets are illiquid in   \nnature, and proceeds from redemptions will not\nbe received until the underlying assets are   \nliquidated or distributed, the timing of which\nis uncertain. Private equity, hedge and real  \nestate funds described above are primarily    \n\u201ccovered funds\u201d as defined in the Volcker Rule\nof the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). The \nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve     \nSystem (FRB) extended the conformance period  \nto July 2022 for the firm\u2019s investments in,   \nand relationships with, certain legacy        \n\u201cilliquid funds\u201d (as defined in the Volcker   \nRule) that were in place prior to December    \n2013. This extension is applicable to         \nsubstantially all of the firm\u2019s remaining     \ninvestments in, and relationships with, such  \ncovered funds. Substantially all of the credit\nfunds described above are not covered funds.  \nThe table below\npresents the fair value\nof investments in funds\nat NAV and the related\nunfunded commitments.\n                                              \n  $ in\u00a0            Fair\u00a0Value       Unfunded  \n  millions                 of    Commitments  \n                  Investments                 \n  As of                                       \n  December\u00a0                                   \n  2020                                        \n  Private                                  $  \n  equity               $2,042            557  \n  funds                                       \n  Credit                1,312            680  \n  funds                                       \n  Hedge funds             102              \u2013  \n  Real estate             208            213  \n  funds                                       \n  Total                $3,664         $1,450  \n  As of                                       \n  December\u00a0                                   \n  2019                                        \n  Private                                     \n  equity               $2,767        $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0765  \n  funds                                       \n  Credit                  983            820  \n  funds                                       \n  Hedge funds             125              \u2013  \n  Real estate             331            196  \n  funds                                       \n  Total                $4,206         $1,781  \n                                              \nAvailable-for-                                \nSaleSecurities                                \nAvailable-for-sale\nsecurities are\naccounted for at fair\nvalue, and the related\nunrealized fair value\ngains and losses are\nincluded in accumulated\nother comprehensive\nincome/(loss) unless\ndesignated in a fair\nvalue hedging\nrelationship.

FICO credit scores are periodically \nrefreshed by the firm to assess the updated   \ncreditworthiness of the borrower. See         \n\u201cVintage\u201d below for information about         \ninstallment and credit card loans by FICO     \ncredit scores. The vast majority of the       \nremaining loans of $ 9.73billion as of        \nDecember 2020 and $ 9.54billion as of December\n2019 included in the other/unrated category   \nare secured. These loans primarily consist of \nwealth management loans backed by residential \nreal estate and securities, and purchased real\nestate-backed loans. The firm\u2019s risk          \nassessment process for such loans includes    \nreviewing certain key metrics, such as loan-  \nto-valueratio, delinquency status, collateral \nvalues, expected cash flows and other risk    \nfactors. The firm also assigns a regulatory   \nrisk rating to its loans based on the         \ndefinitions provided by the U.S. federal bank \nregulatory agencies. Total loans included 85% \nof loans as of December 2020 and 91% of loans \nas of December 2019 that were rated pass/non- \ncriticized.                                   \n                                       \n  150    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \nNonaccrual and Past Due Loans. Loans accounted\nfor at amortized cost (other than credit card \nloans) are placed on nonaccrual status when it\nis probable that the firm will not collect all\nprincipal and interest due under the          \ncontractual terms, regardless of the          \ndelinquency status or if a loan is past due   \nfor 90 days or more, unless the loan is both  \nwell collateralized and in the process of     \ncollection. At that time, all accrued but     \nuncollected interest is reversed against      \ninterest income and interest subsequently     \ncollected is recognized on a cash basis to the\nextent the loan balance is deemed collectible.\nOtherwise, all cash received is used to reduce\nthe outstanding loan balance. A loan is       \nconsidered past due when a principal or       \ninterest payment has not been made according  \nto its contractual terms. Credit card loans   \nare not placed on nonaccrual status and accrue\ninterest until the loan is paid in full or is \ncharged-off. In certain circumstances, the    \nfirm may modify the original terms of a loan  \nagreement by granting a concession to a       \nborrower experiencing financial difficulty,   \ntypically in the form of a modification of    \nloan covenants, but may also include          \nforbearance of interest or principal, payment \nextensions or interest rate reductions. These \nmodifications, to the extent significant, are \nconsidered troubled debt restructurings       \n(TDRs). Loan modifications that extend payment\nterms for a period of less than 90 days are   \ngenerally considered insignificant and        \ntherefore not reported as TDRs. In response to\nthe global outbreak of the coronavirus        \n(COVID-19)pandemic, the firm adopted the      \nrelief issued under the Coronavirus Aid,      \nRelief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, as \namended, and certain interpretive guidance    \nissued by the U.S. banking agencies that      \nprovides for certain modified loans that would\notherwise meet the definition of a TDR to not \nbe classified as such. As of December 2020,   \nthe firm had $ 184million of loans accounted  \nfor at amortized cost that were not classified\nas TDRs as a result of this relief and        \ninterpretive guidance.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \nAllowance for Credit Losses The firm\u2019s        \nallowance for credit losses consists of the   \nallowance for losses on loans and lending     \ncommitments accounted for at amortized cost.  \nLoans and lending commitments accounted for at\nfair value or accounted for at the lower of   \ncost or fair value are not subject to an      \nallowance for credit losses. The firm adopted \nASU No. 2016-13in January 2020, which replaced\nthe incurred credit loss model for recognizing\ncredit losses with the CECL model. As a       \nresult, the firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\neffective January 2020 reflects management\u2019s  \nestimate of credit losses over the remaining  \nexpected life of such loans and also considers\nforecasts of future economic conditions. Prior\nto January 2020, the allowance for credit     \nlosses reflected probable incurred credit     \nlosses. See Note 3 for further information    \nabout the adoption of CECL. To determine the  \nallowance for credit losses, the firm         \nclassifies its loans and lending commitments  \naccounted for at amortized cost into wholesale\nand consumer portfolios. Prior to January     \n2020, the firm also had PCI loans which were  \nclassified as a separate portfolio. These     \nportfolios represent the level at which the   \nfirm has developed and documented its         \nmethodology to determine the allowance for    \ncredit losses. The allowance for credit losses\nis measured on a collective basis for loans   \nthat exhibit similar risk characteristics     \nusing a modeled approach and asset-specific   \nbasis for loans that do not share similar risk\ncharacteristics. Under CECL, the allowance for\ncredit losses takes into account the weighted \naverage of a range of forecasts of future     \neconomic conditions over the expected life of \nthe loan and lending commitments. The expected\nlife of each loan or lending commitment is    \ndetermined based on the contractual term      \nadjusted for extension options or demand      \nfeatures. The forecasts include baseline,     \nfavorable and adverse economic scenarios over \na three-year period. For loans with expected  \nlives beyond three years, the model reverts to\nhistorical loss information based on a non-   \nlinearmodeled approach. The forecasted        \neconomic scenarios consider a number of risk  \nfactors relevant to the wholesale and consumer\nportfolios described below. The firm applies  \njudgment in weighing individual scenarios each\nquarter based on a variety of factors,        \nincluding the firm\u2019s internally derived       \neconomic outlook, market consensus, recent    \nmacroeconomic conditions and industry trends. \nThe allowance for\ncredit losses also\nincludes qualitative\ncomponents which allow\nmanagement to reflect\nthe uncertain nature of\neconomic forecasting,\ncapture uncertainty\nregarding model inputs,\nand account for model\nimprecision and\nconcentration risk.\n\nManagement\u2019s estimate\nof credit losses\nentails judgment about\nloan collectability at\nthe reporting dates,\nand there are\nuncertainties inherent\nin those judgments. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses is subject to a\ngovernance process that\ninvolves review and\napproval by senior\nmanagement within the\nfirm\u2019s independent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions. Personnel\nwithin the firm\u2019s\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions are\nresponsible for\nforecasting the\neconomic variables that\nunderlie the economic\nscenarios that are used\nin the modeling of\nexpected credit losses.\nWhile management uses\nthe best information\navailable to determine\nthis estimate, future\nadjustments to the\nallowance may be\nnecessary based on,\namong other things,\nchanges in the economic\nenvironment or\nvariances between\nactual results and the\noriginal assumptions\nused.\n\nThe table below\npresents gross loans\nand lending commitments\naccounted for at\namortized cost by\nportfolio.\n                                              \n                 As                           \n                 of                           \n               Dec\u2026                           \n               2020             2019          \n  $                                     Len\u2026  \n  in\u00a0          Loa\u2026    Len\u2026    Loans    Com\u2026  \n  mi\u2026                                         \n       Who\u2026                                   \n  Co\u2026          $44\u2026    $12\u2026    $41,\u2026    $12\u2026  \n  We\u2026          25,\u2026    2,3\u2026    20,1\u2026    2,1\u2026  \n  ma\u2026                                         \n  Co\u2026                                         \n  re\u2026          17,\u2026    4,1\u2026    12,8\u2026    3,2\u2026  \n  es\u2026                                         \n  Re\u2026                                         \n  re\u2026          5,2\u2026    1,8\u2026    4,965     759  \n  es\u2026                                         \n  Ot\u2026          3,2\u2026    4,8\u2026    3,396    3,0\u2026  \n  Co\u2026                                         \n  In\u2026          3,8\u2026       4    4,747      12  \n  Cr\u2026          4,2\u2026    21,\u2026    1,858    13,\u2026  \n  ca\u2026                                         \n  PCI             \u2013       \u2013    1,622       \u2013  \n  To\u2026          $10\u2026    $16\u2026    $90,\u2026    $15\u2026  \n                                              \n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    153  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements In \nthe table above, wholesale loans included $   \n3.51billion as of December 2020 and $         \n1.49billion as of December 2019 of nonaccrual \nloans for which the allowance for credit      \nlosses was measured on an asset-specific      \nbasis. The allowance for credit losses on     \nthese loans was $ 649million as of December   \n2020 and $ 207million as of December 2019.    \nThese loans included $ 584million as of       \nDecember 2020 and $ 754million as of December \n2019 of loans which did not require a reserve \nas the loan was deemed to be recoverable. See \nNote 18 for further information about lending \ncommitments. The following is a description of\nthe methodology used to calculate the         \nallowance for credit losses: Wholesale. The   \nallowance for credit losses for wholesale     \nloans and lending commitments that exhibit    \nsimilar risk characteristics is measured using\na modeled approach. These models determine the\nprobability of default and loss given default \nbased on various risk factors, including      \ninternal credit ratings, industry default and \nloss data, expected life, macroeconomic       \nindicators, the borrower\u2019s capacity to meet   \nits financial obligations, the borrower\u2019s     \ncountry of risk and industry, loan seniority  \nand collateral type. For lending commitments, \nthe methodology also considers probability of \ndrawdowns or funding. In addition, for loans  \nbacked by real estate, risk factors include   \nthe loan-to-valueratio, debt service ratio and\nhome price index. The most significant inputs \nto the forecast model for wholesale loans and \nlending commitments include unemployment      \nrates, GDP, credit spreads, commercial and    \nindustrial delinquency rates, short- and long-\nterm interest rates, and oil prices. The      \nallowance for loan losses for wholesale loans \nthat do not share similar risk                \ncharacteristics, such as nonaccrual loans or  \nloans in a troubled debt restructuring, is    \ncalculated using the present value of expected\nfuture cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s    \noriginal effective rate, the observable market\nprice of the loan or the fair value of the    \ncollateral. Wholesale loans are charged-      \noffagainst the allowance for loan losses when \ndeemed to be uncollectible. Consumer. The     \nallowance for credit losses for consumer loans\nthat exhibit similar risk characteristics is  \ncalculated using a modeled approach which     \nclassifies consumer loans into pools based on \nborrower-related and exposure-related         \ncharacteristics that differentiate a pool\u2019s   \nrisk characteristics from other pools. The    \nfactors considered in determining a pool are  \ngenerally consistent with the risk            \ncharacteristics used for internal credit risk \nmeasurement and management and include key    \nmetrics, such as FICO credit scores,          \ndelinquency status, loan vintage and          \nmacroeconomic indicators. The most significant\ninputs to the forecast model for consumer     \nloans include unemployment rates and          \ndelinquency rates. The expected life of       \nrevolving credit card loans is determined by  \nmodeling expected future draws and the timing \nand amount of repayments allocated to the     \nfunded balance. The firm does not recognize an\nallowance for credit losses on credit card    \nlending commitments as they are cancellable by\nthe firm. The allowance for credit losses for \nconsumer loans that do not share similar risk \ncharacteristics, such as loans in a troubled  \ndebt restructuring, is calculated using the   \npresent value of expected future cash flows   \ndiscounted at the loan\u2019s original effective   \nrate. Installment loans are charged-offwhen   \nthey are 120 days past due. Credit card loans \nare charged-offwhen they are 180 days past    \ndue.                                          \n                                       \n  154    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Credit Losses Rollforward       \nCommentary Year Ended December 2020. The      \nallowance for credit losses increased by $    \n2.63billion during 2020. The impact of CECL   \nadoption for wholesale and consumer loans was \ndriven by the fact that the allowance under   \nCECL covers expected credit losses over the   \nfull expected life of the loan portfolios and \nalso considers forecasts of expected future   \neconomic conditions. The impact of CECL       \nadoption for PCI loans was as a result of the \nfirm electing to apply the fair value option  \nfor such loans. The provision for credit      \nlosses for wholesale and consumer loans       \nreflected the continued impact of the         \nCOVID-19pandemic on economic conditions, which\nresulted in higher modeled expected losses and\nlower recoveries. The allowance for loan      \nlosses ratio for wholesale loans increased to \n2.7% as of December 2020 compared with 1.1% as\nof December 2019, while the allowance for loan\nlosses ratio for consumer loans increased to  \n15.9% as of December 2020 compared with 6.0%  \nas of December 2019. The increase in the      \nallowance for loan losses ratios reflected    \nboth the impact of adopting the CECL standard,\nas well as higher provision for credit losses.\nWhen modeling expected credit losses, the firm\nemploys a weighted, multivariate forecast,    \nwhich includes baseline, adverse and favorable\neconomic scenarios. As of December 2020, the  \nforecasted economic scenarios were most       \nheavily weighted towards the baseline and     \nadverse scenarios.

The firm\ngenerally calculates\nthe fair value of\nloans and lending\ncommitments for which\nthe fair value option\nis elected by\ndiscounting future\ncash flows at a rate\nwhich incorporates the\ninstrument-specific\ncredit spreads. For\nfloating-rate loans\nand lending\ncommitments,\nsubstantially all\nchanges in fair value\nare attributable to\nchanges in instrument-\nspecific credit\nspreads, whereas for\nfixed-rate loans and\nlending commitments,\nchanges in fair value\nare also attributable\nto changes in interest\nrates.\nNote 11. Collateralized Agreements and        \nFinancings Collateralized agreements are      \nresale agreements and securities borrowed.    \nCollateralized financings are repurchase      \nagreements, securities loaned and other       \nsecured financings. The firm enters into these\ntransactions in order to, among other things, \nfacilitate client activities, invest excess   \ncash, acquire securities to cover short       \npositions and finance certain firm activities.\nCollateralized agreements and financings are  \npresented on a net-by-counterpartybasis when a\nlegal right of setoff exists. Interest on     \ncollateralized agreements, which is included  \nin interest income, and collateralized        \nfinancings, which is included in interest     \nexpense, is recognized over the life of the   \ntransaction. See Note 23 for further          \ninformation about interest income and interest\nexpense. Resale and Repurchase Agreements A   \nresale agreement is a transaction in which the\nfirm purchases financial instruments from a   \nseller, typically in exchange for cash, and   \nsimultaneously enters into an agreement to    \nresell the same or substantially the same     \nfinancial instruments to the seller at a      \nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. A repurchase agreement is a transaction \nin which the firm sells financial instruments \nto a buyer, typically in exchange for cash,   \nand simultaneously enters into an agreement to\nrepurchase the same or substantially the same \nfinancial instruments from the buyer at a     \nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. Even though repurchase and resale       \nagreements (including \u201crepos- and reverses-to-\nmaturity\u201d)involve the legal transfer of       \nownership of financial instruments, they are  \naccounted for as financing arrangements       \nbecause they require the financial instruments\nto be repurchased or resold before or at the  \nmaturity of the agreement. The financial      \ninstruments purchased or sold in resale and   \nrepurchase agreements typically include U.S.  \ngovernment and agency, and investment-grade   \nsovereign obligations. The firm receives      \nfinancial instruments purchased under resale  \nagreements and makes delivery of financial    \ninstruments sold under repurchase agreements. \nTo mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors\nthe market value of these financial           \ninstruments on a daily basis, and delivers or \nobtains additional collateral due to changes  \nin the market value of the financial          \ninstruments, as appropriate.

When assessing\ngoodwill for\nimpairment, first, a\nqualitative assessment\ncan be made to\ndetermine whether it\nis more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of a\nreporting unit is less\nthan its estimated\ncarrying value. If the\nresults of the\nqualitative assessment\nare not conclusive, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest is performed.\nAlternatively, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest can be performed\nwithout performing a\nqualitative\nassessment.\n\nThe quantitative\ngoodwill test compares\nthe estimated fair\nvalue of each\nreporting unit with\nits estimated net book\nvalue (including\ngoodwill and\nidentifiable\nintangible assets). If\nthe reporting unit\u2019s\nestimated fair value\nexceeds its estimated\nnet book value,\ngoodwill is not\nimpaired. An\nimpairment is\nrecognized if the\nestimated fair value\nof a reporting unit is\nless than its\nestimated net book\nvalue.\nTo estimate the fair value of each reporting  \nunit, other than Consumer banking, a relative \nvalue technique is used because the firm      \nbelieves market participants would use this   \ntechnique to value these reporting units. The \nrelative value technique applies observable   \nprice-to-earningsmultiples or price-to-       \nbookmultiples of comparable competitors to    \nreporting units\u2019 net earnings or net book     \nvalue. To estimate the fair value of Consumer \nbanking, a discounted cash flow valuation     \napproach is used because the firm believes    \nmarket participants would use this technique  \nto value that reporting unit given its early  \nstage of development. The estimated net       \ncarrying value of each reporting unit reflects\nan allocation of total shareholders\u2019 equity   \nand represents the estimated amount of total  \nshareholders\u2019 equity required to support the  \nactivities of the reporting unit under        \ncurrently applicable regulatory capital       \nrequirements. During 2020, the outbreak of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic broadly impacted the        \noperating environment. Uncertainty about the  \nCOVID-19 pandemic and its continued impact    \npersisted throughout the year. As a result,   \nthe firm performed a qualitative assessment in\neach of the first, second and third quarters  \nof 2020 with respect to each of the firm\u2019s    \nreporting units to determine whether it was   \nmore likely than not that the estimated fair  \nvalue of any of these reporting units was less\nthan its estimated carrying value. Based on   \nthese qualitative assessments, the firm       \ndetermined that it was more likely than not   \nthat the estimated fair value of each of the  \nreporting units exceeded its respective       \nestimated carrying value, and that the impact \nof the COVID-19 pandemic, in each quarter, was\nnot a triggering event to perform a           \nquantitative test. In the fourth quarter of   \n2020, the firm performed its annual assessment\nof goodwill for impairment, for each of its   \nreporting units, by performing a qualitative  \nassessment. Multiple factors were assessed    \nwith respect to each of the firm\u2019s reporting  \nunits to determine whether it was more likely \nthan not that the estimated fair value of any \nof these reporting units was less than its    \nestimated carrying value. The qualitative     \nassessment also considered changes since the  \nquantitative test performed in the fourth     \nquarter of 2019.                              \n                                       \n  168    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \nThe firm considered\nthe following factors\nin the qualitative\nannual assessment when\nevaluating whether it\nwas more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of a\nreporting unit was\nless than its\nestimated carrying\nvalue:\n                                              \n       Performance Indicators.During 2020,    \n       the firm\u2019s net revenues, diluted       \n       earnings per common share (EPS),       \n       return on average common               \n       shareholders\u2019 equity (ROE) and book    \n       value per common share all increased   \n       compared with 2019. The firm\u2019s         \n       operating expenses increased,          \n       primarily reflecting significantly     \n       higher net provisions for litigation   \n       and regulatory proceedings and higher  \n       compensation and benefits expenses     \n  \u2022    (reflecting improved financial         \n       performance). Despite the increase in  \n       expenses, the efficiency ratio (total  \n       operating expenses divided by total    \n       net revenues) improved compared with   \n       2019 and the pre-tax margin remained   \n       stable. In addition, with the          \n       exception of net provisions for        \n       litigation and regulatory              \n       proceedings, there were no             \n       significant changes to the firm\u2019s      \n       overall cost structure since the       \n       prior quantitative goodwill test was   \n       performed.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       Macroeconomic Indicators.The impact    \n       of theCOVID-19pandemic caused a sharp  \n       contraction in economic activity in    \n       early 2020. However, intervention by   \n       central banks and governments, which   \n       undertook significant monetary and     \n       fiscal policy actions, allowed the     \n  \u2022    global economy to make progress        \n       towards recovery during the second     \n       half of 2020. The global economy is    \n       expected to continue to recover in     \n       2021 and beyond, although there        \n       remains significant uncertainty        \n       related to the impact and duration of  \n       the COVID-19 pandemic.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Firm and Industry Events.Aside from    \n       the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic    \n       on the firm and its peers\u2019 operating   \n  \u2022    environment, there were no events,     \n       entity-specific or otherwise, that     \n       would have had a significant negative  \n       impact on the valuation of the firm\u2019s  \n       reporting units.                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Fair Value Indicators.Since the 2019   \n       quantitative goodwill test, fair       \n       value indicators in the market         \n       generally declined as of the third     \n       quarter of 2020, as global equity      \n       prices were lower, credit spreads      \n       were wider, and the firm and its       \n       peers\u2019 stock prices and price-to-book  \n       multiples were lower. However, in the  \n  \u2022    fourth quarter of 2020, the improving  \n       global economic outlook, investor      \n       sentiment and positive developments    \n       for COVID-19 vaccines resulted in      \n       higher global equity prices and        \n       tighter credit spreads compared to     \n       the levels at the end of 2019.         \n       Similarly, the firm\u2019s stock price and  \n       price-to-book multiple ended the year  \n       higher compared with the end of 2019.  \n                                              \nAs a result of the\nqualitative assessment,\nthe firm determined\nthat it was more likely\nthan not that the\nestimated fair value of\neach of the reporting\nunits exceeded its\nrespective estimated\ncarrying value.\nTherefore, the firm\ndetermined that\ngoodwill for each\nreporting unit was not\nimpaired and that a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest was not required.\nIdentifiable Intangible                       \nAssets                                        \nThe table below\npresents identifiable\nintangible assets by\nreporting unit and\ntype.\n                                              \n                    As of                     \n                 December                     \n  $ in\u00a0              2020            2019     \n  millions                                    \n  By                                          \n  Reporting                                   \n  Unit                                        \n  Global                                      \n  Markets:                                    \n  FICC                 $2               $     \n                                        3     \n  Equities             45               \u2013     \n  Asset               274             265     \n  Manageme\u2026                                   \n  Consumer\u00a0                                   \n  & Wealth                                    \n  Manageme\u2026                                   \n  Consumer              6               7     \n  banking                                     \n  Wealth              303             366     \n  manageme\u2026                                   \n  Total              $630        $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0641     \n  By Type                                     \n  Customer                                    \n  lists                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  carrying         $1,478         $\u00a01,427     \n  value                                       \n  Accumula\u2026        (1,089  )       (1,044  )  \n  amortiza\u2026                                   \n  Net                                         \n  carrying            389             383     \n  value                                       \n  Acquired                                    \n  leases                                      \n  and other                                   \n  Gross                                       \n  carrying            710             790     \n  value                                       \n  Accumula\u2026          (469  )         (532  )  \n  amortiza\u2026                                   \n  Net                                         \n  carrying            241             258     \n  value                                       \n  Total                                       \n  gross             2,188           2,217     \n  carrying                                    \n  value                                       \n  Total                                       \n  accumula\u2026        (1,558  )       (1,576  )  \n  amortiza\u2026                                   \n  Total net                                   \n  carrying           $630        $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0641     \n  value                                       \n                                              \nThe firm acquired $\n155million of\nintangible assets\nduring 2020, primarily\nrelated to acquired\nleases and customer\nlists, with a weighted\naverage amortization\nperiod of 10years.

Variable lease costs, which are     \nincluded in operating lease costs, were not   \nmaterial for 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Securitization Activities  \nThe firm securitizes residential and          \ncommercial mortgages, corporate bonds, loans  \nand other types of financial assets by selling\nthese assets to securitization vehicles (e.g.,\ntrusts, corporate entities and limited        \nliability companies) or through a             \nresecuritization. The firm acts as underwriter\nof the beneficial interests that are sold to  \ninvestors. The firm\u2019s residential mortgage    \nsecuritizations are primarily in connection   \nwith government agency securitizations. The   \nfirm accounts for a securitization as a sale  \nwhen it has relinquished control over the     \ntransferred financial assets. Prior to        \nsecuritization, the firm generally accounts   \nfor assets pending transfer at fair value and \ntherefore does not typically recognize        \nsignificant gains or losses upon the transfer \nof assets.

Variable Interest Entities           \nA variable interest in\na VIE is an investment\n(e.g., debt or equity)\nor other interest\n(e.g., derivatives or\nloans and lending\ncommitments) that will\nabsorb portions of the\nVIE\u2019s expected losses\nand/or receive\nportions of the VIE\u2019s\nexpected residual\nreturns.\n\nThe firm\u2019s variable\ninterests in VIEs\ninclude senior and\nsubordinated debt;\nloans and lending\ncommitments; limited\nand general\npartnership interests;\npreferred and common\nequity; derivatives\nthat may include\nforeign currency,\nequity and/or credit\nrisk; guarantees; and\ncertain of the fees\nthe firm receives from\ninvestment funds.\nCertain interest rate,\nforeign currency and\ncredit derivatives the\nfirm enters into with\nVIEs are not variable\ninterests because they\ncreate, rather than\nabsorb, risk.\n\nVIEs generally finance\nthe purchase of assets\nby issuing debt and\nequity securities that\nare either\ncollateralized by or\nindexed to the assets\nheld by the VIE. The\ndebt and equity\nsecurities issued by a\nVIE may include\ntranches of varying\nlevels of\nsubordination. The\nfirm\u2019s involvement\nwith VIEs includes\nsecuritization of\nfinancial assets, as\ndescribed in Note 16,\nand investments in and\nloans to other types\nof VIEs, as described\nbelow.

The firm        \nreassesses its determination of whether it is \nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing\nbasis based on current facts and              \ncircumstances. VIE Activities The firm is     \nprincipally involved with VIEs through the    \nfollowing business activities: Mortgage-Backed\nVIEs. The firm sells residential and          \ncommercial mortgage loans and securities to   \nmortgage-backed VIEs and may retain beneficial\ninterests in the assets sold to these VIEs.   \nThe firm purchases and sells beneficial       \ninterests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in   \nconnection with market-making activities. In  \naddition, the firm may enter into derivatives \nwith certain of these VIEs, primarily interest\nrate swaps, which are typically not variable  \ninterests. The firm generally enters into     \nderivatives with other counterparties to      \nmitigate its risk. Real Estate, Credit- and   \nPower-Related and Other Investing VIEs. The   \nfirm purchases equity and debt securities     \nissued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold   \nreal estate, performing and nonperforming     \ndebt, distressed loans, power-related assets  \nand equity securities. The firm generally does\nnot sell assets to, or enter into derivatives \nwith, these VIEs. Corporate Debt and Other    \nAsset-Backed VIEs. The firm structures VIEs   \nthat issue notes to clients, purchases and    \nsells beneficial interests issued by corporate\ndebt and other asset-backed VIEs in connection\nwith market-making activities, and makes loans\nto VIEs that warehouse corporate debt. Certain\nof these VIEs synthetically create the        \nexposure for the beneficial interests they    \nissue by entering into credit derivatives with\nthe firm, rather than purchasing the          \nunderlying assets. In addition, the firm may  \nenter into derivatives, such as total return  \nswaps, with certain corporate debt and other  \nasset-backed VIEs, under which the firm pays  \nthe VIE a return due to the beneficial        \ninterest holders and receives the return on   \nthe collateral owned by the VIE. The          \ncollateral owned by these VIEs is primarily   \nother asset-backed loans and securities. The  \nfirm may be removed as the total return swap  \ncounterparty and may enter into derivatives   \nwith other counterparties to mitigate its risk\nrelated to these swaps. The firm may sell     \nassets to the corporate debt and other asset- \nbacked VIEs it structures.                    \n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    177  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \nCommercial Lending. The firm\u2019s commercial     \nlending commitments were primarily extended to\ninvestment-grade corporate borrowers. Such    \ncommitments primarily included $ 110.31billion\nas of December 2020 and $ 101.31billion as of \nDecember 2019, related to relationship lending\nactivities (principally used for operating and\ngeneral corporate purposes) and $ 15.81billion\nas of December 2020 and $ 27.71billion as of  \nDecember 2019, related to other investment    \nbanking activities (generally extended for    \ncontingent acquisition financing and are often\nintended to be short-term in nature, as       \nborrowers often seek to replace them with     \nother funding sources). The firm also extends \nlending commitments in connection with other  \ntypes of corporate lending, as well as        \ncommercial real estate financing. See Note 9  \nfor further information about funded loans. To\nmitigate the credit risk associated with the  \nfirm\u2019s commercial lending activities, the firm\nobtains credit protection on certain loans and\nlending commitments through credit default    \nswaps, both single-name and index-based       \ncontracts, and through the issuance of credit-\nlinked notes. In addition, Sumitomo Mitsui    \nFinancial Group, Inc. provides the firm with  \ncredit loss protection on certain approved    \nloan commitments. Warehouse Financing. The    \nfirm provides financing to clients who        \nwarehouse financial assets. These arrangements\nare secured by the warehoused assets,         \nprimarily consisting of residential real      \nestate, consumer and corporate loans. Credit  \nCards. The firm\u2019s credit card lending         \ncommitments represents credit card lines      \nissued by the firm to consumers. These credit \ncard lines are cancellable by the firm. In    \nJanuary 2021, the firm entered into a co-     \nbranded credit card relationship with General \nMotors and agreed to acquire the related      \ncredit card portfolio from Capital One. The   \npurchase price for this portfolio will depend \non the outstanding balance of credit card     \nloans at the time that the acquisition closes,\nwhich is expected to be in September 2021. As \nof December 2020, this portfolio had          \noutstanding credit card loans of approximately\n$ 2.0billion. In connection with this         \nacquisition, the firm\u2019s results will include a\nprovision for credit losses in the first      \nquarter of 2021, currently estimated at $     \n180million. Risk Participations The firm also \nrisk participates certain of its commercial   \nlending commitments to other financial        \ninstitutions. In the event of a risk          \nparticipant\u2019s default, the firm will be       \nresponsible to fund the borrower.             \nCollateralized Agreement Commitments/         \nCollateralized Financing Commitments          \nCollateralized agreement commitments includes \nforward starting resale and securities        \nborrowing agreements, and collateralized      \nfinancing commitments includes forward        \nstarting repurchase and secured lending       \nagreements that settle at a future date,      \ngenerally within three business days.         \nCollateralized agreement commitments also     \nincludes transactions where the firm has      \nentered into commitments to provide contingent\nfinancing to its clients and counterparties   \nthrough resale agreements. The firm\u2019s funding \nof these commitments depends on the           \nsatisfaction of all contractual conditions to \nthe resale agreement and these commitments can\nexpire unused. Letters of Credit The firm has \ncommitments under letters of credit issued by \nvarious banks which the firm provides to      \ncounterparties in lieu of securities or cash  \nto satisfy various collateral and margin      \ndeposit requirements. Investment Commitments  \nInvestment commitments includes commitments to\ninvest in private equity, real estate and     \nother assets directly and through funds that  \nthe firm raises and manages. Investment       \ncommitments included $ 1.69billion as of      \nDecember 2020 and $ 2.06billion as of December\n2019, related to commitments to invest in     \nfunds managed by the firm. If these           \ncommitments are called, they would be funded  \nat market value on the date of investment.    \nContingencies Legal Proceedings.

The firm enters into   \nvarious derivatives that meet the definition  \nof a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including     \nwritten equity and commodity put options,     \nwritten currency contracts and interest rate  \ncaps, floors and swaptions. These derivatives \nare risk managed together with derivatives    \nthat do not meet the definition of a          \nguarantee, and therefore the amounts in the   \ntable above do not reflect the firm\u2019s overall \nrisk related to derivative activities.        \nDisclosures about derivatives are not required\nif they may be cash settled and the firm has  \nno basis to conclude it is probable that the  \ncounterparties held the underlying instruments\nat inception of the contract. The firm has    \nconcluded that these conditions have been met \nfor certain large, internationally active     \ncommercial and investment bank counterparties,\ncentral clearing counterparties, hedge funds  \nand certain other counterparties.Accordingly, \nthe firm has not included such contracts in   \nthe table above. See Note 7 for information   \nabout credit derivatives that meet the        \ndefinition of a guarantee, which are not      \nincluded in the table above. Derivatives are  \naccounted for at fair value and therefore the \ncarrying value is considered the best         \nindication of payment/performance risk for    \nindividual contracts. However, the carrying   \nvalues in the table above exclude the effect  \nof counterparty and cash collateral netting.  \nSecurities Lending and Clearing Guarantees.   \nSecurities lending and clearing guarantees    \ninclude the indemnifications and guarantees   \nthat the firm provides in its capacity as an  \nagency lender and in its capacity as a        \nsponsoring member of the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. As an agency lender, the firm    \nindemnifies most of its securities lending    \ncustomers against losses incurred in the event\nthat borrowers do not return securities and   \nthe collateral held is insufficient to cover  \nthe market value of the securities borrowed.  \nThe maximum payout of such indemnifications   \nwas $ 19.86billion as of December 2020 and $  \n17.89billion as of December 2019. Collateral  \nheld by the lenders in connection with        \nsecurities lending indemnifications was $     \n20.39billion as of December 2020 and $        \n19.14billion as of December 2019. Because the \ncontractual nature of these arrangements      \nrequires the firm to obtain collateral with a \nmarket value that exceeds the value of the    \nsecurities lent to the borrower, there is     \nminimal performance risk associated with these\nindemnifications.                             \n                                       \n  182    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements In \nthe fourth quarter of 2020, the firm became a \nsponsoring member of the Government Securities\nDivision of the Fixed Income Clearing         \nCorporation in connection with certain resale \nand repurchase agreements. As a sponsoring    \nmember, the firm guarantees the performance of\nits sponsored member clients to the Fixed     \nIncome Clearing Corporation. To minimize      \npotential losses on such guarantees, the firm \nobtains a security interest in the collateral \nthat the sponsored client placed with the     \nFixed Income Clearing Corporation. Therefore, \nthe risk of loss on such guarantees is        \nminimal. As of December 2020, the maximum     \npayout on this guarantee was$ 1.49billion and \nthe related collateral held was $ 1.50billion \n. Other Financial Guarantees. In the ordinary \ncourse of business, the firm provides other   \nfinancial guarantees of the obligations of    \nthird parties (e.g., standby letters of credit\nand other guarantees to enable clients to     \ncomplete transactions and fund-related        \nguarantees). These guarantees represent       \nobligations to make payments to beneficiaries \nif the guaranteed party fails to fulfill its  \nobligation under a contractual arrangement    \nwith that beneficiary. Other financial        \nguarantees also include a guarantee that the  \nfirm has provided to the Government of        \nMalaysia that it will receive at least $      \n1.4billion in assets and proceeds from assets \nseized by governmental authorities around the \nworld related to 1Malaysia Development Berhad,\na sovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB).   \nSee Note 27 for further information. The firm \nwill periodically evaluate progress toward    \nsatisfying the $ 1.4 billion obligation based \non information to be received on a semi-annual\nbasis, expected in February and August.       \nGuarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts. The\nfirm has established trusts, including Goldman\nSachs Capital I, the APEX Trusts and other    \nentities, for the limited purpose of issuing  \nsecurities to third parties, lending the      \nproceeds to the firm and entering into        \ncontractual arrangements with the firm and    \nthird parties related to this purpose. The    \nfirm does not consolidate these entities. See \nNote 14 for further information about the     \ntransactions involving Goldman Sachs Capital I\nand the APEX Trusts. The firm effectively     \nprovides for the full and unconditional       \nguarantee of the securities issued by these   \nentities. Timely payment by the firm of       \namounts due to these entities under the       \nguarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and     \nrelated contractual arrangements will be      \nsufficient to cover payments due on the       \nsecurities issued by these entities.          \nManagement believes that it is unlikely that  \nany circumstances will occur, such as         \nnonperformance on the part of paying agents or\nother service providers, that would make it   \nnecessary for the firm to make payments       \nrelated to these entities other than those    \nrequired under the terms of the guarantee,    \nborrowing, preferred stock and related        \ncontractual arrangements and in connection    \nwith certain expenses incurred by these       \nentities. Indemnities and Guarantees of       \nService Providers. In the ordinary course of  \nbusiness, the firm indemnifies and guarantees \ncertain service providers, such as clearing   \nand custody agents, trustees and              \nadministrators, against specified potential   \nlosses in connection with their acting as an  \nagent of, or providing services to, the firm  \nor its affiliates. The firm may also be liable\nto some clients or other parties for losses   \narising from its custodial role or caused by  \nacts or omissions of third-party service      \nproviders, including sub-custodiansand third- \nparty brokers. In certain cases, the firm has \nthe right to seek indemnification from these  \nthird-party service providers for certain     \nrelevant losses incurred by the firm. In      \naddition, the firm is a member of payment,    \nclearing and settlement networks, as well as  \nsecurities exchanges around the world that may\nrequire the firm to meet the obligations of   \nsuch networks and exchanges in the event of   \nmember defaults and other loss scenarios. In  \nconnection with the firm\u2019s prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear \nand settle on behalf of its clients the       \ntransactions entered into by them with other  \nbrokerage firms. The firm\u2019s obligations in    \nrespect of such transactions are secured by   \nthe assets in the client\u2019s account, as well as\nany proceeds received from the transactions   \ncleared and settled by the firm on behalf of  \nthe client. In connection with joint venture  \ninvestments, the firm may issue loan          \nguarantees under which it may be liable in the\nevent of fraud, misappropriation,             \nenvironmental liabilities and certain other   \nmatters involving the borrower. The firm is   \nunable to develop an estimate of the maximum  \npayout under these guarantees and             \nindemnifications. However, management believes\nthat it is unlikely the firm will have to make\nany material payments under these             \narrangements, and no material liabilities     \nrelated to these guarantees and               \nindemnifications have been recognized in the  \nconsolidated balance sheets as of both        \nDecember 2020 and December 2019.              \n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    183  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \nOther Representations, Warranties and         \nIndemnifications. The firm provides           \nrepresentations and warranties to             \ncounterparties in connection with a variety of\ncommercial transactions and occasionally      \nindemnifies them against potential losses     \ncaused by the breach of those representations \nand warranties. The firm may also provide     \nindemnifications protecting against changes in\nor adverse application of certain U.S. tax    \nlaws in connection with ordinary-course       \ntransactions, such as securities issuances,   \nborrowings or derivatives. In addition, the   \nfirm may provide indemnifications to some     \ncounterparties to protect them in the event   \nadditional taxes are owed or payments are     \nwithheld, due either to a change in or an     \nadverse application of certain non-U.S.tax    \nlaws. These indemnifications generally are    \nstandard contractual terms and are entered    \ninto in the ordinary course of business.      \nGenerally, there are no stated or notional    \namounts included in these indemnifications,   \nand the contingencies triggering the          \nobligation to indemnify are not expected to   \noccur. The firm is unable to develop an       \nestimate of the maximum payout under these    \nguarantees and indemnifications.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \nNote 20. Regulation and Capital Adequacy The  \nFRB is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a \nBHC under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of\n1956 and a financial holding company under    \namendments to this Act. The firm is subject to\nconsolidated regulatory capital requirements  \nwhich are calculated in accordance with the   \nregulations of the FRB (Capital Framework).   \nThe capital requirements are expressed as     \nrisk-based capital and leverage ratios that   \ncompare measures of regulatory capital to     \nrisk-weighted assets (RWAs), average assets   \nand off-balancesheet exposures. Failure to    \ncomply with these capital requirements could  \nresult in restrictions being imposed by the   \nfirm\u2019s regulators and could limit the firm\u2019s  \nability to repurchase shares, pay dividends   \nand make certain discretionary compensation   \npayments. The firm\u2019s capital levels are also  \nsubject to qualitative judgments by the       \nregulators about components of capital, risk  \nweightings and other factors. Furthermore,    \ncertain of the firm\u2019s subsidiaries are subject\nto separate regulations and capital           \nrequirements. Capital Framework The           \nregulations under the Capital Framework are   \nlargely based on the Basel Committee on       \nBanking Supervision\u2019s (Basel Committee)       \ncapital framework for strengthening           \ninternational capital standards (Basel III)   \nand also implement certain provisions of the  \nDodd-Frank Act. Under the Capital Framework,  \nthe firm is an \u201cAdvanced approach\u201d banking    \norganization and has been designated as a     \nglobal systemically important bank (G-SIB).   \nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum    \nrisk-based capital and the capital            \nconservation buffer requirements. The buffer  \nmust consist entirely of capital that         \nqualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)      \ncapital. Prior to October 1, 2020, the capital\nconservation buffer requirements under both   \nthe Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules   \nwere comprised of (i) a 2.5% buffer, (ii) the \ncountercyclical capital buffer and (iii) the  \nG-SIB surcharge. Beginning on October 1, 2020,\nthe 2.5% buffer was replaced with the stress  \ncapital buffer under the Standardized Capital \nRules. The components of thecapital           \nconservation buffer requirements under the    \nAdvanced Capital Rules remain unchanged.      \nThe firm calculates its\nCET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital and Total\ncapital ratios in\naccordance with the\nStandardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules.\nBeginning on October 1,\n2020, each of the\nratios calculated under\nthe Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules\nmust meet the\nrespective capital\nrequirements. Prior to\nOctober 1, 2020, the\nlower of each risk-\nbased capital ratio\ncalculated under the\nStandardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules\nwas the ratio against\nwhich the firm\u2019s\ncompliance with its\nrisk-based capital\nrequirements was\nassessed.\n\nUnder the Capital\nFramework, the firm is\nalso subject to\nleverage requirements\nwhich consist of a\nminimum Tier 1 leverage\nratio and a minimum\nsupplementary leverage\nratio (SLR), as well as\nthe SLR buffer.\n\nConsolidated Regulatory\nCapital Requirements\n\nRisk-Based Capital\nRatios.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \nFor both risk\nmanagement purposes\nand regulatory capital\ncalculations, the firm\nuses a single VaR\nmodel which captures\nrisks, including those\nrelated to interest\nrates, equity prices,\ncurrency rates and\ncommodity prices.\nHowever, VaR used for\nrisk management\npurposes differs from\nVaR used for\nregulatory capital\nrequirements\n(regulatory VaR) due\nto differences in time\nhorizons, confidence\nlevels and the scope\nof positions on which\nVaR is calculated. For\nrisk management\npurposes, a 95 % one-\nday VaR is used,\nwhereas for regulatory\ncapital requirements,\na 99 % 10-day VaR is\nused to determine\nMarket RWAs and a 99 %\none-day VaR is used to\ndetermine regulatory\nVaR exceptions. In\naddition, the daily\nnet revenues used to\ndetermine risk\nmanagement VaR\nexceptions (i.e.,\ncomparing the daily\nnet revenues to the\nVaR measure calculated\nas of the end of the\nprior business day)\ninclude intraday\nactivity, whereas the\nCapital Framework\nrequires that intraday\nactivity be excluded\nfrom daily net\nrevenues when\ncalculating regulatory\nVaR exceptions.\nIntraday activity\nincludes bid/offer net\nrevenues, which are\nmore likely than not\nto be positive by\ntheir nature.

These\nincreases were\npartially offset by a\ndecrease in specific\nrisk, principally due\nto changes in risk\nmeasurements on\ncertain exposures.\nAdvanced Credit RWAs as of December 2020      \nincreased by $ 51.63billion compared with     \nDecember 2019, primarily reflecting an        \nincrease in derivatives, principally due to   \nthe impact of higher levels of volatility and \ncounterparty credit risk and an increase in   \ncommitments, guarantees and loans, principally\ndue to increased lending activity. These      \nincreases were partially offset by a decrease \nin equity investments, principally due to the \nsale of certain equity positions. Advanced    \nMarket RWAs as of December 2020 increased by $\n4.34billion compared with December 2019,      \nprimarily reflecting an increase in regulatory\nVaR, principally due to increased market      \nvolatility, and an increase in incremental    \nrisk, principally due to increased exposures  \nin equities held for market-making purposes.  \nThese increases were partially offset by a    \ndecrease in specific risk, principally due to \nchanges in risk measurements on certain       \nexposures. Advanced Operational RWAs as of    \nDecember 2020 increased by $ 9.13billion      \ncompared with December 2019. The vast majority\nof this increase was associated with          \nlitigation and regulatory proceedings. Year   \nEnded December 2019. Standardized Credit RWAs \nas of December 2019 increased by $            \n25.65billion compared with December 2018,     \nprimarily reflecting an increase in           \ncommitments, guarantees and loans, principally\ndue to an increase in lending activity, and an\nincrease in other credit RWAs, principally due\nto the recognition of operating lease right-  \nof-useassets upon adoption of ASU No.         \n2016-02and an increase in corporate debt      \nexposures. Standardized Market RWAs as of     \nDecember 2019 decreased by $ 9.98billion      \ncompared with December 2018, primarily        \nreflecting a decrease in specific risk,       \nprincipally due to reduced exposures, and a   \ndecrease in incremental risk, principally due \nto reduced exposures and changes in risk      \nmeasurements. Advanced Credit RWAs as of      \nDecember 2019 decreased by $ 7.67billion      \ncompared with December 2018. Beginning in the \nfourth quarter of 2019, the firm made changes \nto the calculation of the loss given default  \nfor certain wholesale exposures which resulted\nin a decrease in credit RWAs, primarily in    \ncommitments, guarantees and loans and         \nderivatives. This decrease was partially      \noffset by an increase in other credit RWAs,   \nprincipally due to the recognition of         \noperating lease right-of-useassets upon       \nadoption of ASU No. 2016-02and an increase in \ncorporate debt exposures.

As of both\nDecember\u00a02020 and\nDecember\u00a02019, GSIB\nand GSBE were in\ncompliance with their\nregulatory capital\nrequirements.\nOther. The deposits of GS Bank USA are insured\nby the FDIC to the extent provided by law. The\nFRB requires that GS Bank USA maintain cash   \nreserves with the Federal Reserve. The amount \ndeposited by GS Bank USA at the Federal       \nReserve was $ 52.71billion as of December 2020\nand $ 50.55billion as of December 2019, which \nexceeded required reserve amounts by $        \n52.71billion as of December 2020 (as the FRB  \nreduced reserve requirement ratios to zero    \npercent in 2020) and $ 50.29billion as of     \nDecember 2019. Restrictions on Payments Group \nInc. may be limited in its ability to access  \ncapital held at certain subsidiaries as a     \nresult of regulatory, tax or other            \nconstraints. These limitations include        \nprovisions of applicable law and regulations  \nand other regulatory restrictions that limit  \nthe ability of those subsidiaries to declare  \nand pay dividends without prior regulatory    \napproval. Also, as a result of GS Bank USA\u2019s  \nelection to exclude holdings of U.S. Treasury \nsecurities and deposits at the Federal Reserve\nfrom its total leverage exposure, any dividend\nby GS Bank USA during the period from July 1, \n2020 through March 31, 2021 is subject to the \nprior approval of the FRB. Furthermore, the   \namount of dividends that may be paid by GS    \nBank USA are limited to the lesser of the     \namounts calculated under a recent earnings    \ntest and an undivided profits test. The FRB,  \nthe FDIC and the NYDFS have authority to      \nprohibit or to limit the payment of dividends \nby the banking organizations they supervise   \n(including GS Bank USA) if, in the regulator\u2019s\nopinion, payment of a dividend would          \nconstitute an unsafe or unsound practice in   \nlight of the financial condition of the       \nbanking organization. In addition,            \nsubsidiaries not subject to separate          \nregulatory capital requirements may hold      \ncapital to satisfy local tax and legal        \nguidelines, rating agency requirements (for   \nentities with assigned credit ratings) or     \ninternal policies, including policies         \nconcerning the minimum amount of capital a    \nsubsidiary should hold based on its underlying\nlevel of risk. Group Inc.\u2019s equity investment \nin subsidiaries was $ 103.80billion as of     \nDecember 2020 and $ 95.68billion as of        \nDecember 2019, of which Group Inc. was        \nrequired to maintain $ 63.68billion as of     \nDecember 2020 and $ 57.58billion as of        \nDecember 2019, of minimum equity capital in   \nits regulated subsidiaries in order to satisfy\nthe regulatory requirements of such           \nsubsidiaries. Group Inc.\u2019s capital invested in\ncertain non-U.S.subsidiaries is exposed to    \nforeign exchange risk, substantially all of   \nwhich is managed through a combination of     \nderivatives and non-U.S.denominated debt.

As\na general matter, in\nthe ordinary course of\nbusiness, the firm does\nnot expect to provide\nadditional voluntary\nfinancial support to\nany covered funds, but\nmay choose to do so\nwith respect to funds\nthat are not subject to\nthe Volcker Rule.\nHowever, any such\nsupport is not expected\nto be material to the\nresults of operations\nof the firm.\nIn March 2020, GS Bank\nUSA and unaffiliated\nentities purchased\ncertificates of deposit\nand commercial paper\nfrom two money market\nfunds managed by the\nfirm. These funds are\nnot covered funds under\nthe Volcker Rule. GS\nBank USA\u2019s purchase\nprice of these\nsecurities was $\n1.84billion, of which $\n321million was\noutstanding as of\nDecember 2020.

The firm    \nalso recorded a valuation allowance of $      \n79million as of both December 2020 and        \nDecember 2019, related to these net operating \nloss carryforwards. As of December 2020, the  \nU.S. federal net operating loss carryforward  \nwas $ 1.00billion, the state and local net    \noperating loss carryforward was $ 1.07billion,\nand the foreign net operating loss            \ncarryforward was $ 1.06billion. If not        \nutilized, the U.S. federal ,the state and     \nlocal, and foreign net operating loss         \ncarryforwards will begin to expire in 2021. If\nthese carryforwards expire, they will not have\na material impact on the firm\u2019s results of    \noperations. As of December 2020, the firm has \nrecorded deferred tax assets of $ 14million in\nconnection with general business credit       \ncarryforwards and $ 20million in connection   \nwith state and local tax credit carryforwards.\nIf not utilized, the general business credit  \ncarryforward will begin to expire in 2021and  \nthe state and local tax credit carryforward   \nwill begin to expire in 2023. As of December  \n2020, the firm did not have any foreign tax   \ncredit carryforwards. As of both December 2020\nand December 2019, the firm had no U.S.       \ncapital loss carryforwards and norelated net  \ndeferred income tax assets. As of December    \n2020, the firm had deferred tax assets of $   \n258million in connection with foreign capital \nloss carryforwards and a valuation allowance  \nof $ 258million related to these capital loss \ncarryforwards. The valuation allowance        \nincreased by $ 84million during 2020 and      \nincreased by $ 222million during 2019. The    \nincreases in both 2020 and 2019 were primarily\ndue to an increase in deferred tax assets from\nwhich the firm does not expect to realize any \nbenefit. The firm permanently reinvested      \neligible earnings of certain foreign          \nsubsidiaries. As of both December 2020 and    \nDecember 2019, all U.S. taxes were accrued on \nthese subsidiaries\u2019 distributable earnings,   \nsubstantially all of which resulted from the  \nTax Legislation repatriation tax and GILTI.   \n                                       \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02020\u00a0Form 10-K    197  \n                                       \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

The\nfieldwork for tax years\n2011 through 2017 has\nbeen completed. During\n2020, the firm reached\nan agreement with the\nIRS on certain items\nrelated to tax years\nthrough 2017, which did\nnot have a material\nimpact on the effective\ntax rate. The final\nresolution of the audit\nfor tax years 2011\nthrough 2017 is not\nexpected to have a\nmaterial impact on the\neffective tax rate. The\n2018 and 2019 tax years\nremain subject to post-\nfiling review.\n\nDuring 2020, New York\nState and City\nexaminations (excluding\nGS Bank USA) of 2011\nthrough 2014 were\ncompleted. The\nresolution of these\nexaminations did not\nhave a material impact\non the effective tax\nrate. New York State\nand City examinations\nfor GS Bank USA through\n2014 were completed in\n2016.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \nNote 27. Legal Proceedings The firm is        \ninvolved in a number of judicial, regulatory  \nand arbitration proceedings (including those  \ndescribed below) concerning matters arising in\nconnection with the conduct of the firm\u2019s     \nbusinesses. Many of these proceedings are in  \nearly stages, and many of these cases seek an \nindeterminate amount of damages. Under ASC    \n450, an event is \u201creasonably possible\u201d if \u201cthe\nchance of the future event or events occurring\nis more than remote but less than likely\u201d and \nan event is \u201cremote\u201d if \u201cthe chance of the    \nfuture event or events occurring is slight.\u201d  \nThus, references to the upper end of the range\nof reasonably possible loss for cases in which\nthe firm is able to estimate a range of       \nreasonably possible loss mean the upper end of\nthe range of loss for cases for which the firm\nbelieves the risk of loss is more than slight.\nWith respect to matters described below for   \nwhich management has been able to estimate a  \nrange of reasonably possible loss where (i)   \nactual or potential plaintiffs have claimed an\namount of money damages, (ii) the firm is     \nbeing, or threatened to be, sued by purchasers\nin a securities offering and is not being     \nindemnified by a party that the firm believes \nwill pay the full amount of any judgment, or  \n(iii) the purchasers are demanding that the   \nfirm repurchase securities, management has    \nestimated the upper end of the range of       \nreasonably possible loss as being equal to (a)\nin the case of (i), the amount of money       \ndamages claimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the \ndifference between the initial sales price of \nthe securities that the firm sold in such     \noffering and the estimated lowest subsequent  \nprice of such securities prior to the action  \nbeing commenced and (c) in the case of (iii), \nthe price that purchasers paid for the        \nsecurities less the estimated value, if any,  \nas of December 2020 of the relevant           \nsecurities, in each of cases (i), (ii) and    \n(iii), taking into account any other factors  \nbelieved to be relevant to the particular     \nmatter or matters of that type. As of the date\nhereof, the firm has estimated the upper end  \nof the range of reasonably possible aggregate \nloss for such matters and for any other       \nmatters described below where management has  \nbeen able to estimate a range of reasonably   \npossible aggregate loss to be approximately $ \n0.9billion in excess of the aggregate reserves\nfor such matters. Management is generally     \nunable to estimate a range of reasonably      \npossible loss for matters other than those    \nincluded in the estimate above, including     \nwhere (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have \nnot claimed an amount of money damages, except\nin those instances where management can       \notherwise determine an appropriate amount,    \n(ii) matters are in early stages, (iii)       \nmatters relate to regulatory investigations or\nreviews, except in those instances where      \nmanagement can otherwise determine an         \nappropriate amount, (iv) there is uncertainty \nas to the likelihood of a class being         \ncertified or the ultimate size of the class,  \n(v) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of \npending appeals or motions, (vi) there are    \nsignificant factual issues to be resolved,    \nand/or (vii) there are novel legal issues     \npresented. For example, the firm\u2019s potential  \nliabilities with respect to the investigations\nand reviews described below in \u201cRegulatory    \nInvestigations and Reviews and Related        \nLitigation\u201d generally are not included in     \nmanagement\u2019s estimate of reasonably possible  \nloss. However, management does not believe,   \nbased on currently available information, that\nthe outcomes of such other matters will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the firm\u2019s         \nfinancial condition, though the outcomes could\nbe material to the firm\u2019s operating results   \nfor any particular period, depending, in part,\nupon the operating results for such period.   \nSee Note 18 for further information about     \nmortgage-related contingencies. 1MDB-Related  \nMatters Between 2012 and 2013, subsidiaries of\nthe firm acted as arrangers or purchasers of  \napproximately $ 6.5billion of debt securities \nof 1MDB. On November 1, 2018, the U.S.        \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) unsealed a        \ncriminal information and guilty plea by Tim   \nLeissner, a former participating managing     \ndirector of the firm, and an indictment       \nagainst Ng Chong Hwa, a former managing       \ndirector of the firm, and Low Taek Jho.       \nLeissner pleaded guilty to a two-countcriminal\ninformation charging him with conspiring to   \nlaunder money and conspiring to violate the   \nU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\u2019s (FCPA)   \nanti-bribery and internal accounting controls \nprovisions. Low and Ng were charged in a      \nthree-count indictment with conspiring to     \nlaunder money and conspiring to violate the   \nFCPA\u2019s anti-bribery provisions. On August 28, \n2018, Leissner\u2019s guilty plea was accepted by  \nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern       \nDistrict of New York and Leissner was         \nadjudicated guilty on both counts.

In addition, GS   \nMalaysia pleaded guilty to one count of       \nconspiracy to violate the FCPA.

The complaints seek         \ndeclaratory, injunctive and other equitable   \nrelief, as well as unspecified monetary       \ndamages, including treble damages. In December\n2016, the district court granted defendants\u2019  \nmotions to dismiss and on August 27, 2019, the\nSecond Circuit vacated the district court\u2019s   \ndismissals and remanded the case to district  \ncourt for further proceedings.

Employee Benefit Plans The firm      \nsponsors various pension plans and certain    \nother postretirement benefit plans, primarily \nhealthcare and life insurance. The firm also  \nprovides certain benefits to former or        \ninactive employees prior to retirement.       \nDefined Benefit Pension Plans and             \nPostretirement Plans Employees of certain     \nnon-U.S.subsidiaries participate in various   \ndefined benefit pension plans. These plans    \ngenerally provide benefits based on years of  \ncredited service and a percentage of eligible \ncompensation. The firm maintains a defined    \nbenefit pension plan for certain U.K.         \nemployees. As of April 2008, the U.K. defined \nbenefit plan was closed to new participants   \nand frozen for existing participants as of    \nMarch 31, 2016. The non-U.S.plans do not have \na material impact on the firm\u2019s consolidated  \nresults of operations. The firm also maintains\na defined benefit pension plan for            \nsubstantially all U.S. employees hired prior  \nto November 1, 2003. As of November 2004, this\nplan was closed to new participants and frozen\nfor existing participants. In addition, the   \nfirm maintains unfunded postretirement benefit\nplans that provide medical and life insurance \nfor eligible retirees and their dependents    \ncovered under these programs. These plans do  \nnot have a material impact on the firm\u2019s      \nconsolidated results of operations. The firm  \nrecognizes the funded status of its defined   \nbenefit pension and postretirement plans,     \nmeasured as the difference between the fair   \nvalue of the plan assets and the benefit      \nobligation, in the consolidated balance       \nsheets. As of December 2020, other assets     \nincluded $ 343million (related to overfunded  \npension plans) and other liabilities included \n$ 478million, related to these plans. As of   \nDecember 2019, other assets included $        \n257million (related to overfunded pension     \nplans) and other liabilities included $       \n415million, related to these plans. Defined   \nContribution Plans The firm contributes to    \nemployer-sponsored U.S. and non-U.S.defined   \ncontribution plans. The firm\u2019s contribution to\nthese plans was $ 261million for 2020, $      \n254million for 2019 and $ 240million for 2018.\nNote 29. Employee Incentive Plans The cost of \nemployee services received in exchange for a  \nshare-based award is generally measured based \non the grant-date fair value of the award.    \nShare-based awards that do not require future \nservice (i.e., vested awards, including awards\ngranted to retirement-eligible employees) are \nexpensed immediately. Share-based awards that \nrequire future service are amortized over the \nrelevant service period. Forfeitures are      \nrecorded when they occur. Cash dividend       \nequivalents paid on RSUs are generally charged\nto retained earnings. If RSUs that require    \nfuture service are forfeited, the related     \ndividend equivalents originally charged to    \nretained earnings are reclassified to         \ncompensation expense in the period in which   \nforfeiture occurs. The firm generally issues  \nnew shares of common stock upon delivery of   \nshare-based awards. In certain cases,         \nprimarily related to conflicted employment (as\noutlined in the applicable award agreements), \nthe firm may cash settle share-based          \ncompensation awards accounted for as equity   \ninstruments. For these awards, whose terms    \nallow for cash settlement, additional paid-   \nincapital is adjusted to the extent of the    \ndifference between the value of the award at  \nthe time of cash settlement and the grant-date\nvalue of the award. Stock Incentive Plan The  \nfirm sponsors a stock incentive plan, The     \nGoldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock      \nIncentive Plan (2018) (2018 SIP), which       \nprovides for grants of RSUs, restricted stock,\ndividend equivalent rights, incentive stock   \noptions, nonqualified stock options, stock    \nappreciation rights, and other share-based    \nawards, each of which may be subject to       \nperformance conditions. On May 2, 2018,       \nshareholders approved the 2018 SIP. The 2018  \nSIP replaced The Goldman Sachs Amended and    \nRestated Stock Incentive Plan (2015) (2015    \nSIP) previously in effect, and applies to     \nawards granted on or after the date of        \napproval. The 2015 SIP had previously replaced\nThe Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock  \nIncentive Plan (2013) (2013 SIP). As of       \nDecember 2020, 55.5million shares were        \navailable for grant under the 2018 SIP.
