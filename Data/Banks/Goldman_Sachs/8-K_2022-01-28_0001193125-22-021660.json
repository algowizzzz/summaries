(the            \n\u201cRegistrant,\u201d the \u201cfirm\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d) today       \nannounced that the Board of Directors         \n(\u201cBoard\u201d), upon the recommendation of the     \nCompensation Committee, has determined the    \n2021 total annual compensation for David M.   \nSolomon, our Chairman and Chief Executive     \nOfficer.                                      \n                                              \nMr. Solomon\u2019s total annual compensation for   \n2021 is $35 million (which consists of an     \nannual base salary of $2 million unchanged    \nfrom 2020, as well as annual variable         \ncompensation, described below). This compares \nto total annual compensation for 2020 of $27.5\nmillion (before the $10 million reduction     \ndetermined by the Board related to the        \nsettlement of matters relating to 1Malaysia   \nDevelopment Berhad).                          \n                                              \nMr. Solomon\u2019s 2021 annual variable            \ncompensation is $33 million, 70% of which     \n(i.e., $23.1 million) is in the form of       \nperformance-based restricted stock units      \n(\u201cPSUs\u201d), with the remainder to be paid in the\nform of cash. PSUs tie 100% of Mr. Solomon\u2019s  \nannual equity-based compensation to ongoing   \nperformance metrics.                          \n                                              \nThe Compensation Committee was guided in its  \ndetermination of 2021 compensation by, among  \nother things, the firm\u2019s Performance          \nAssessment Framework, which is comprised of   \nidentified financial performance metrics as   \nwell as non-financial factors (i.e., client   \norientation; risk management; and people      \nstrategy scorecard). To this end, in making   \n2021 compensation decisions, the Compensation \nCommittee considered these factors as well as,\namong other things, the firm\u2019s performance and\ncontinued strong progress on its growth       \nstrategy, as well as Mr. Solomon\u2019s outstanding\nindividual performance, including his         \nleadership in guiding the firm to achieve     \nthese results.                                \n                                              \nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the     \nRegistrant reported record net revenues of    \n$59.34 billion, record net earnings of $21.64 \nbillion, record diluted earnings per common   \nshare of $59.45 and return on average common  \nshareholders\u2019 equity of 23.0% (the firm\u2019s     \nhighest since 2007). For 2021, the firm also  \ndelivered book value per share growth of 20.4%\nand total shareholder return (\u201cTSR\u201d) of 47.5%.\n                                              \nShareholder Value Creation Awards             \n                                              \nWe also announced today that the Board, upon  \nthe recommendation of the Compensation        \nCommittee, determined to grant Shareholder    \nValue Creation Awards, in the same form as was\ngranted to Mr. Solomon and John E. Waldron    \n(President and Chief Operating Officer) in    \nOctober 2021, more broadly across the members \nof our Management Committee, including to     \nrevenue division headsand leaders of our      \ncontrol, finance and operating divisions.     \n                                              \nThese awards broaden the scope of the three   \nkey objectives of the Shareholder Value       \nCreation Awards: (1) align compensation with  \nrigorous performance thresholds that drive    \nlong-term shareholder value creation; (2)     \nensure leadership continuity over the next 5+ \nyears in the next phase of Goldman Sachs\u2019     \ngrowth strategy; and (3) enhance retention in \nresponse to the increasing competition for    \ntalent in the current environment.            \n                                              \nIn granting these Shareholder Value Creation  \nAwards, the Board sought to be responsive to  \nshareholder feedback regarding the importance \nof addressing these three objectives across   \nthe firm\u2019s senior leadership team. The Board  \nbelieves providing Shareholder Value Creation \nAwards with the same terms as those granted to\nMessrs. Solomon and Waldron to Management     \nCommittee members, including our Executive    \nOfficers, will further enhance collaboration  \nand teamwork by aligning the incentive        \nstructure across the firm\u2019s most senior       \nleaders.                                      \n                                              \nIn addition, in support of these goals and in \norder to further tie annual compensation to   \nongoing performance metrics, our Compensation \nCommittee determined that 2021 year-end       \nequity-based compensation for all of the      \nmembers of our Management Committee, including\nour Executive Officers, should be 100% in PSUs\n(consistent with the existing pay mix for     \nMessrs. Solomon and Waldron).                 \n                                              \nSimilar to the Shareholder Value Creation     \nAwards granted to Messrs. Solomon and Waldron \nin October 2021 (and described on a Form 8-K  \nfiled by the Registrant on October 22, 2021), \nthe Management Committee Shareholder Value    \nCreation Awards are not part of 2021 annual   \ncompensation and will not be awarded on a     \nregularly recurring basis.
