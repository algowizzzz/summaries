In addition, the\nsingle point of\nentry strategy described below is intended to\nimpose losses at the top-tier holding company\nlevel in the resolution of a global\nsystemically important bank\n(\u0093G-SIB\u0094) such as Group Inc.\n\nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank Act created a\nresolution regime known as\nthe \u0093orderly liquidation authority\u0094 to which\nfinancial companies, including bank holding\ncompanies such as Group Inc., can be\nsubjected. Under the orderly liquidation\nauthority, the FDIC may be appointed as\nreceiver for a financial company\nfor purposes of liquidating the entity if,\nupon the recommendation of applicable\nregulators, the Secretary of the Treasury\ndetermines, among other things, that the\nentity is in severe financial distress, that\nthe entity\u0092s failure would have\nserious adverse effects on the U.S. financial\nsystem and that resolution under the orderly\nliquidation authority would avoid or mitigate\nthose effects. Absent such determinations,\nGroup Inc., as a U.S. bank holding company,\nwould remain subject to\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n\nIf the FDIC is appointed as receiver under\nthe orderly liquidation authority, then the\norderly liquidation authority,\nrather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would\ndetermine the powers of the receiver and the\nrights and obligations of creditors and other\nparties who have transacted with Group Inc.\nThere are substantial differences between the\nrights available to\ncreditors in the orderly liquidation\nauthority and in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,\nincluding the right of the FDIC under the\norderly liquidation authority to disregard\nthe strict priority of creditor claims in\nsome circumstances (which would otherwise\nbe respected by a bankruptcy court) and the\nuse of an administrative claims procedure to\ndetermine creditors\u0092 claims (as opposed to\nthe judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy\nproceedings). In certain circumstances under\nthe orderly\nliquidation authority, the FDIC could elevate\nthe priority of claims that it determines\nnecessary to facilitate a smooth and orderly\nliquidation without the need to obtain\ncreditors\u0092 consent or prior court review. In\naddition, the FDIC has the\nright to transfer claims to a third party or\n\u0093bridge\u0094 entity under the orderly liquidation\nauthority.\n\nThe FDIC has announced that a\nsingle point of entry strategy may be a\ndesirable strategy to resolve a large\nfinancial institution such as Group Inc. in a\nmanner that would, among other things, impose\nlosses on shareholders, debt holders\n(including, in our case, holders of our\nsecurities) and other creditors of the top-\ntier holding company (in our case, Group\nInc.), while permitting the holding company\u0092s\nsubsidiaries to continue to operate. In\naddition, the Federal Reserve\nBoard has adopted requirements that U.S.\nG-SIBs, including Group Inc., maintain\nminimum amounts of long-term debt and total\nloss-absorbing capacity to facilitate the\napplication of the single point of entry\nresolution strategy. It is possible that the\napplication of the single point of entry\nstrategy under the orderly liquidation\nauthority\u0097in which Group Inc. would be the\nonly entity to enter resolution\nproceedings\u0097would result in greater\nlosses to holders of our securities\n(including holders of our fixed rate,\nfloating rate and indexed\n\n8\n\ndebt securities), than the losses that would\nresult from the application of a bankruptcy\nproceeding or a different resolution\nstrategy, such as a multiple point of entry\nresolution strategy for\nGroup Inc. and certain of its material\nsubsidiaries. Assuming Group Inc. entered\nresolution proceedings and that support from\nGroup Inc. or other available resources to\nits subsidiaries was sufficient to enable the\nsubsidiaries to remain solvent,\nlosses at the subsidiary level would be\ntransferred to Group Inc. and ultimately\nborne by Group Inc.\u0092s security holders,\nthird-party creditors of Group Inc.\u0092s\nsubsidiaries would receive full recoveries on\ntheir claims, and Group\nInc.\u0092s security holders (including our\nshareholders, holders of our debt securities\nand other unsecured creditors) could face\nsignificant and possibly complete losses. In\nthat case, Group Inc.\u0092s security holders\nwould face losses while the\nthird-party creditors of Group Inc.\u0092s\nsubsidiaries would incur no losses because\nthe subsidiaries would continue to operate\nand would not enter resolution or bankruptcy\nproceedings. In addition, holders of our\neligible LTD (defined below) and\nholders of our other debt securities could\nface losses ahead of our other similarly\nsituated creditors in a resolution under the\norderly liquidation authority if the FDIC\nexercised its right, described above, to\ndisregard the priority of creditor\nclaims.\n\nThe orderly liquidation authority also\nprovides the FDIC with authority to cause\ncreditors and shareholders of a financial\ncompany (such as\nGroup Inc.) in receivership to bear losses\nbefore taxpayers are exposed to such losses,\nand amounts owed to the U.S. government would\ngenerally receive a statutory payment\npriority over the claims of private\ncreditors, including senior creditors. In\naddition, under the orderly liquidation\nauthority, claims of creditors (including\nholders of our securities) could be satisfied\nthrough the issuance of equity or other\nsecurities in a bridge entity to which Group\nInc.\u0092s assets are transferred.\nIf such a securities-for-claims exchange were\nimplemented, there can be no assurance that\nthe value of the securities of the bridge\nentity would be sufficient to repay\nor satisfy all or any part of the creditor\nclaims for which the securities were\nexchanged. While the FDIC has issued\nregulations to implement the orderly\nliquidation authority, not all aspects of how\nthe FDIC might exercise this authority are\nknown\nand additional rulemaking is possible. In\naddition, certain jurisdictions, including\nthe U.K. and the E.U., have implemented, or\nare considering, changes to resolution\nregimes to provide resolution authorities\nwith the ability to recapitalize a\nfailing entity by writing down its unsecured\ndebt or converting its unsecured debt into\nequity. Such \u0093bail-in\u0094 powers are intended to\nenable the recapitalization of a failing\ninstitution by\nallocating losses to its shareholders and\nunsecured debtholders. For example, the Bank\nof England requires a certain amount of\nintercompany funding that we provide to our\nmaterial U.K. subsidiaries to contain a\ncontractual trigger to expressly\npermit the Bank of England to exercise such\n\u0093bail-in\u0094 powers in certain circumstances. If\nthe intercompany funding we provide to our\nsubsidiaries is \u0093bailed in,\u0094 Group Inc.\u0092s\nclaims on\nits subsidiaries would be subordinated to the\nclaims of the subsidiaries\u0092 third party\ncreditors or written down. U.S. regulators\nare considering and non-U.S. authorities have\nadopted requirements that\ncertain subsidiaries of large financial\ninstitutions maintain minimum amounts of\ntotal loss absorbing capacity that would pass\nlosses up from the subsidiaries to the top-\ntier BHC and, ultimately, to security\nholders of the top-tier holding company in\nthe event of failure.\n\nThe application of Group Inc.\u0092s proposed\nresolution strategy could result in greater\nlosses for Group Inc.\u0092s security holders.\n\nAs required by the Dodd-Frank Act and\nregulations\nissued by the Federal Reserve Board and the\nFDIC, we are required to provide to the\nFederal Reserve Board and the FDIC a plan for\nour rapid and orderly resolution in the event\nof material financial distress affecting the\nfirm or the failure of Group\nInc. In our resolution plan, Group Inc. would\nbe resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nThe strategy described in our resolution plan\nis a variant of the single point of entry\nstrategy: Group Inc. and Goldman Sachs\nFunding LLC (\u0093Funding\nIHC\u0094), a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of\nGroup Inc., would recapitalize and provide\nliquidity to certain major subsidiaries,\nincluding through the forgiveness of\nintercompany indebtedness, the extension of\nthe maturities of intercompany\nindebtedness and the extension of additional\nintercompany loans. If this strategy were\nsuccessful, creditors of some or all of\n\n9\n\nGroup Inc.\u0092s major subsidiaries would receive\nfull recoveries on their claims, while Group\nInc.\u0092s security holders could face\nsignificant and possibly complete losses.\n\nTo facilitate the execution of our resolution\nplan, we formed Funding IHC. In exchange for\nan unsecured subordinated funding note and\nequity interest,\nGroup Inc. transferred certain intercompany\nreceivables and substantially all of its\nglobal core liquid assets (\u0093GCLA\u0094) to Funding\nIHC, and agreed to transfer additional GCLA\nabove prescribed thresholds.\n\nWe also put in place a Capital and Liquidity\nSupport Agreement (\u0093CLSA\u0094) among Group Inc.,\nFunding IHC and our major subsidiaries. Under\nthe\nCLSA, Funding IHC has provided Group Inc.\nwith a committed line of credit that allows\nGroup Inc. to draw sufficient funds to meet\nits cash needs during the ordinary course of\nbusiness. In addition, if our financial\nresources deteriorate so severely\nthat resolution may be imminent, (i) the\ncommitted line of credit will automatically\nterminate and the unsecured subordinated\nfunding note will automatically be forgiven,\n(ii) all intercompany receivables owed by the\nmajor subsidiaries to\nGroup Inc. will be transferred to Funding IHC\nor their maturities will be extended to five\nyears, (iii) Group Inc. will be obligated to\ntransfer substantially all of its remaining\nintercompany receivables and GCLA (other than\nan amount to fund\nanticipated bankruptcy expenses) to Funding\nIHC, and (iv) Funding IHC will be obligated\nto provide capital and liquidity support to\nthe major subsidiaries. Group Inc.\u0092s and\nFunding IHC\u0092s obligations under the CLSA are\nsecured pursuant\nto a related security agreement. Such actions\nwould materially and adversely affect Group\nInc.\u0092s liquidity. As a result, during a\nperiod of severe stress, Group Inc. might\ncommence bankruptcy proceedings at an earlier\ntime than it otherwise\nwould if the CLSA and related security\nagreement had not been implemented.\n\nIf our proposed resolution strategy were\nsuccessful, Group Inc.\u0092s\nsecurity holders could face losses while the\nthird-party creditors of Group Inc.\u0092s major\nsubsidiaries would incur no losses because\nthose subsidiaries would continue to operate\nand not enter resolution or bankruptcy\nproceedings. As part of the\nstrategy, Group Inc. could also seek to\nelevate the priority of its guarantee\nobligations relating to its major\nsubsidiaries\u0092 derivatives contracts or\ntransfer them to another entity so that\ncross-default and early termination rights\nwould be\nstayed under the International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association Universal Resolution\nStay Protocol or International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association 2018 U.S. Resolution\nStay Protocol, as applicable, which would\nresult in holders of our eligible\nLTD (defined below) and holders of our other\ndebt securities incurring losses ahead of the\nbeneficiaries of those guarantee obligations.\nIt is also possible that holders of our\neligible LTD and holders of our other debt\nsecurities could incur losses\nahead of other similarly situated creditors\nof our major subsidiaries. If Group Inc.\u0092s\npreferred resolution strategy were not\nsuccessful, Group Inc.\u0092s financial condition\nwould be adversely impacted and Group Inc.\u0092s\nsecurity holders,\nincluding holders of our debt securities, may\nas a consequence be in a worse position than\nif the strategy had not been implemented. In\nall cases, any payments to holders of our\ndebt securities are dependent on our ability\nto make such payments and\nare therefore subject to our credit risk.\n\nSenior debt securities issued on or after\nJanuary 1, 2017 under the 2008 indenture will\nprovide only limited acceleration and\nenforcement rights.\n\nOn December 15, 2016, the Federal Reserve\nBoard adopted rules (the \u0093TLAC Rules\u0094) that\nrequire the eight U.S. G-SIBs, including\nGroup Inc., among other things, to maintain\nminimum amounts of long-term debt\u0097i.e., debt\nhaving a maturity greater than one year from\nissuance\u0097satisfying\ncertain eligibility criteria (\u0093eligible LTD\u0094)\ncommencing January 1, 2019. The TLAC Rules\ndisqualify from eligible LTD, among other\ninstruments, senior debt securities issued on\nor after December 31, 2016 that permit\nacceleration\nfor reasons other than insolvency or payment\ndefault. As a result of the TLAC Rules, we\nhave modified the 2008 indenture under which\nour senior debt securities may be issued to\nprovide that, for any such debt securities\nissued on or after\nJanuary 1, 2017, the only events of default\nwill be\n\n10\n\npayment defaults that continue for a 30-day\ngrace period and insolvency events as\nspecified herein, unless the applicable\nprospectus supplement says\notherwise. Any other default under or breach\nof the indenture or any such securities will\nnot give rise to an event of default, whether\nafter notice, the passage of time or\notherwise. As a consequence, if any such\nother default or breach occurs,\nneither the trustee nor the holders of any\nsuch securities issued on or after January 1,\n2017 will be entitled to accelerate the\nmaturity of any securities \u0097 that is, they\nwill not be entitled to declare the principal\nof any securities to\nbe immediately due and payable because of\nsuch other default or breach (other than any\nsecurities whose terms specify otherwise, as\ndescribed in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement). These other defaults and\nbreaches would include, among others,\nany breach of the covenants described below\nunder \u0093\u0097 Mergers and Similar Transactions\u0094.\nIn addition, if any such other default or\nbreach occurs, neither the trustee nor the\nholders of any such securities will be\nentitled to enforce or\nseek any remedy under the 2008 indenture or\nthe securities, except as described below\nunder \u0093\u0097 Default, Remedies and Waiver of\nDefault\u0094 in respect of certain covenant\nbreaches.\n\nThe limitations on events of default,\nacceleration rights and other remedies\ndescribed in the prior paragraph do not apply\nwith regard to any securities\nissued under the 1999 indenture or to any\nsecurities issued prior to January 1, 2017\nunder the 2008 indenture. Therefore, if\ncertain defaults or breaches occur, holders\nof securities issued before January1, 2017\nmay be able to accelerate their securities so\nthat such securities become immediately due\nand payable while you, as a holder of\nsecurities issued on or after January1, 2017,\nmay not be able to do so. In such an event,\nour obligation to repay the accelerated\nsecurities in full could adversely affect our\nability to make timely payments on your\nsecurities thereafter.These limitations on\nyour rights and remedies could adversely\naffect the market value of your securities,\nespecially during times of financial stress\nfor us or our industry.\n\nPlease see \u0093Description of Debt Securities We\nMay Offer \u0097 Default,\nRemedies and Waiver of Default\u0094 below for an\nexplanation of the terms \u00931999 indenture\u0094,\n\u00932008 indenture\u0094, \u0093event of default\u0094 and\n\u0093covenant breach\u0094, as well as for information\nregarding acceleration rights\nand remedies.\n\nSubordinated debt securities issued under the\nsubordinated debt indenture provide even more\nlimited acceleration and enforcement rights.\n\nFor any subordinated debt securities issued\nunder the subordinated debt indenture, unless\nthe applicable prospectus supplement says\notherwise, events of default, acceleration\nrights and other remedies will also be\nlimited as described below in \u0093Description of\nDebt Securities We May Offer \u0097 Subordination\nProvisions\u0094. These limitations are greater\nthan those\ndescribed in the prior paragraph with regard\nto senior debt securities. For example, the\nmaturity of the subordinated debt securities\nwould be accelerated only upon insolvency\nevents as specified herein, unless the\napplicable prospectus supplement\nsays otherwise. There will be no right of\nacceleration of the payment of principal of\nthe subordinated debt securities upon a\ndefault in the payment of principal, interest\nor any other amount (including upon\nredemption) on the subordinated debt\nsecurities. Therefore, if certain payment\ndefaults occur, holders of senior debt\nsecurities may be able to accelerate their\nsecurities so that such securities become\nimmediately due and payable while you, as a\nholder of subordinated debt securities,\nmay not be able to do so. In such an event,\nour obligation to repay the accelerated\nsecurities in full could adversely affect our\nability to make timely payments on your\nsecurities thereafter.\n\n11\n\nHolders of our senior debt securities issued\non or after January 1, 2017 under the 2008\nindenture and holders of our subordinated\ndebt securities issued after July 7, 2017\nunder the subordinated debt indenture could\nbe at greater risk for being structurally\nsubordinated if Group Inc. sells or transfers\nits assets substantially as an entirety to\none or more of its subsidiaries.\n\nWith respect to any securities issued on or\nafter January 1, 2017 under the 2008\nindenture and any\nsecurities issued after July 7, 2017 under\nthe subordinated debt indenture, we may sell\nor transfer our assets substantially as an\nentirety, in one or more transactions, to one\nor more entities, provided that the assets of\nGroup, Inc. and its\ndirect or indirect subsidiaries in which it\nowns a majority of the combined voting power,\ntaken together, are not sold or transferred\nsubstantially as an entirety to one or more\nentities that are not such subsidiaries. If\nwe sell or transfer our\nassets substantially as an entirety to our\nsubsidiaries, third-party creditors of our\nsubsidiaries would have additional assets\nfrom which to recover on their claims while\nholders of our securities issued on or after\nJanuary 1, 2017 under the\n2008 indenture and any securities issued\nafter July 7, 2017 under the subordinated\ndebt indenture would be structurally\nsubordinated to creditors of our subsidiaries\nwith respect to such assets.\n\nPlease see \u0093Description of Debt Securities We\nMay Offer \u0097 Mergers and Similar Transactions\u0094\nbelow for more information.\n\n12\n\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\n\nWe intend to use the net proceeds from the\nsales of the securities to provide additional\nfunds for our operations and for other\ngeneral corporate\npurposes.\n\n13\n\nDESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES WE MAY OFFER\n\nPlease note that in this section entitled\n\u0093Description of Debt Securities We May\nOffer\u0094, references to \u0093The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc.\u0094, \u0093we\u0094, \u0093our\u0094 and \u0093us\u0094 refer only\nto The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and not to\nits consolidated subsidiaries. Also, in this\nsection, references to \u0093holders\u0094 mean those\nwho own debt securities registered in their\nown names, on the books that we or the\ntrustee maintain for this purpose, and not\nthose who own beneficial interests in debt\nsecurities registered in street name or in\ndebt securities issued in book-entry form\nthrough one or more depositaries. Owners of\nbeneficial interests in the debt securities\nshould read the section below entitled \u0093Legal\nOwnership and Book-Entry Issuance\u0094.\n\nDebt Securities May Be Senior or Subordinated\n\nWe may issue senior or subordinated debt\nsecurities. Neither the senior debt\nsecurities nor the subordinated debt\nsecurities will be secured by any\nproperty or assets of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. or its subsidiaries. Thus, by\nowning a debt security, you are one of our\nunsecured creditors.\n\nThe senior debt securities will constitute\npart of our senior debt, will be issued under\none of our senior debt indentures (as\ndescribed in \u0093\u0097\nThe Senior Debt Indentures and the\nSubordinated Debt Indenture\u0094 below) and will\nrank equally with all of our other unsecured\nand unsubordinated debt.\n\nThe subordinated debt securities will\nconstitute part of our subordinated debt,\nwill be issued under our subordinated debt\nindenture described below and\nwill be subordinate in right of payment to\nall of our \u0093senior debt\u0094, as defined in the\nsubordinated debt indenture. The prospectus\nsupplement for any series of subordinated\ndebt securities or the information\nincorporated in this prospectus\nby reference will indicate the approximate\namount of senior debt outstanding as of the\nend of our most recent fiscal year.\n\nNone of the indentures\nlimit our ability to incur additional senior\ndebt.\n\nWhen we refer to \u0093debt securities\u0094 in this\nprospectus, we mean both the senior debt\nsecurities and the subordinated debt\nsecurities.\n\nThe Senior Debt Indentures and the\nSubordinated Debt Indenture\n\nThe senior debt securities are governed by\ndocuments called the \u0093senior debt indentures\u0094\n(the Indenture dated as of May 19, 1999, as\namended or supplemented from time to time,\nbetween us and The Bank of New York Mellon\n(formerly known as The Bank of New York), as\ntrustee, which we refer to as the \u00931999\nindenture\u0094, and the Senior Debt Indenture\ndated as of July 16,\n2008, as amended or supplemented from time to\ntime, between us and The Bank of New York\nMellon, as trustee, as amended by the Fourth\nSupplemental Indenture to the 2008 indenture\ndated as of December 31, 2016 (which,\ntogether, we refer to as the\n\u00932008 indenture\u0094), and the subordinated debt\nsecurities are governed by the \u0093subordinated\ndebt indenture\u0094 (the Subordinated Debt\nIndenture dated as of February 20, 2004\nbetween us and The Bank of New York Mellon,\nas trustee,\nand together with the senior debt indentures,\nthe \u0093debt indentures\u0094). The debt indentures\nare substantially identical, except for our\ncovenant described below under \u0093\u0097 Restriction\non Liens\u0094, which is included only in the two\nsenior debt indentures; the provisions\nrelating to subordination, which are included\nonly in the subordinated debt indenture;\ncertain provisions described below under \u0093\u0097\nModification of the Debt Indentures and\nWaiver of Covenants\u0094,\nwhich vary substantially between the two\nsenior debt indentures; and the provisions\nrelating to events of default and rights and\nremedies available upon any default or\nbreach, which vary substantially between the\ntwo senior debt indentures and\nbetween them and the subordinated debt\nindenture.\n\n14\n\nWhether securities have been issued before or\nafter January 1, 2017 under the 2008\nindenture or July 7, 2017 under the\nsubordinated debt indenture will be\ndetermined by us by reference to the time of\nthe original issuance of the series of which\nsuch securities are a part. For this purpose,\n\u0093series\u0094 means securities with the same CUSIP\nnumber. Unless otherwise provided in your\nprospectus supplement, all securities issued\nunder the 2008 indenture on or after January\n1, 2017 will be subject to the provisions of\nthe fourth supplemental indenture to the 2008\nindenture dated December 31, 2016, and all\nsecurities issued under the subordinated debt\nindenture after July 7, 2017 will be subject\nto the provisions of the tenth supplemental\nindenture to the subordinated debt indenture,\ndated July 7, 2017. The trustee under each\ndebt indenture has two main roles:\n                                              \n      First, the trustee can enforce your     \n      rights against us if we default. There  \n      are some limitations on the extent to   \n      which the                               \n      trustee acts on your behalf, which we   \n      describe below under \u0093\u0097\u00a0Default,          \n      Remedies and Waiver of Default\u0094.         \n                                              \n                                              \n      Second, the trustee performs            \n      administrative duties for us, such as   \n      sending you interest payments and       \n      notices.                                \n                                              \nSee \u0093\u0097 Our Relationship With the Trustee\u0094\nbelow for more information about the trustee.\nWhen we refer to the \u0093indenture\u0094, the \u0093debt\nindenture\u0094 or the \u0093trustee\u0094 with respect to\nany debt securities, we mean the debt\nindenture under which those debt securities\nare issued and the trustee under that debt\nindenture. We May Issue Many Debt Securities\nor Series of Debt Securities We may issue many\ndistinct debt securities or series of debt\nsecurities under any of our three debt\nindentures. This section summarizes terms of\nthe debt securities that apply generally to\nall debt securities and series of debt\nsecurities. The provisions of each debt\nindenture allow us not only to issue debt\nsecurities with terms different from those of\ndebt securities previously issued under that\ndebt indenture, but also to \u0093reopen\u0094\npreviously issued debt securities and issue\nadditional debt securities as the same series,\nwith the same CUSIP number, stated maturity,\ninterest payment dates, if any, and other\nterms, except for the date of issuance and\nissue price. We will describe the specific\nterms of your debt securities in the\napplicable prospectus supplement accompanying\nthis prospectus. Those terms may vary from the\nterms described here. As you read this\nsection, please remember that the specific\nterms of your debt security as described in\nyour prospectus supplement will supplement\nand, if applicable, may modify or replace the\ngeneral terms described in this section. If\nthere are any differences between your\nprospectus supplement and this prospectus,\nyour prospectus supplement will control. Thus,\nthe statements we make in this section may not\napply to your debt security. When we refer to\n\u0093debt securities\u0094 or a \u0093series of debt\nsecurities\u0094, we mean, respectively, debt\nsecurities or a series of debt securities\nissued under the applicable debt indenture.\nWhen we refer to your prospectus supplement,\nwe mean the prospectus supplement describing\nthe specific terms of the debt security you\npurchase. The terms used in your prospectus\nsupplement will have the meanings described in\nthis prospectus, unless otherwise specified.\nAmounts That We May Issue None of the debt\nindentures limits the aggregate amount of debt\nsecurities that we may issue or the number of\nseries or the aggregate amount of any\nparticular series of debt securities. We may\nissue debt securities and other securities at\nany time without your consent and without\nnotifying you. 15\n\nThe debt indentures and the debt securities do\nnot limit our ability to incur other\nindebtedness or to\nissue other securities. Also, we are not\nsubject to financial or similar restrictions\nby the terms of the debt securities, except as\ndescribed below under \u0093\u0097 Restriction on\nLiens\u0094.\n\nPrincipal Amount, Stated Maturity and Maturity\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the principal amount\nof a debt security means the principal amount\npayable at its stated maturity, unless such\namount is not\ndeterminable, in which case the principal\namount of a debt security is its face amount.\nAny debt securities owned by us or any of our\naffiliates are not deemed to be outstanding.\n\nThe term \u0093stated maturity\u0094 with respect to any\ndebt security means the day on which the\nprincipal amount of your debt security is\nscheduled to\nbecome due. The principal of your debt\nsecurity may become due sooner, by reason of\nredemption or acceleration after a default or\notherwise in accordance with the terms of your\ndebt security. The day on which the principal\nof your debt security\nactually becomes due, whether at the stated\nmaturity or otherwise, is called the\n\u0093maturity\u0094 of the principal. You will receive\nthe principal amount of your debt security at\nmaturity (plus accrued and unpaid interest, if\nany), unless your\nprospectus supplement specifies another\namount.\n\nWe also use the terms \u0093stated maturity\u0094 and\n\u0093maturity\u0094 to refer to the days\nwhen other payments become due. For example,\nwe may refer to a regular interest payment\ndate when an installment of interest is\nscheduled to become due as the \u0093stated\nmaturity\u0094 of that installment. When we refer\nto the \u0093stated\nmaturity\u0094 or the \u0093maturity\u0094 of a debt security\nwithout specifying a particular payment, we\nmean the stated maturity or maturity, as the\ncase may be, of the principal.\n\nWe Are a Holding Company\n\nBecause our assets\nconsist principally of interests in the\nsubsidiaries through which we conduct our\nbusinesses, our right to participate as an\nequity holder in any distribution of assets of\nany of our subsidiaries upon the subsidiary\u0092s\nliquidation or otherwise,\nand thus the ability of our security holders\nto benefit from the distribution, is junior to\ncreditors of the subsidiary, except to the\nextent that any claims we may have as a\ncreditor of the subsidiary are recognized.\nMany of our subsidiaries,\nincluding our broker-dealer, bank and\ninsurance subsidiaries, are subject to laws\nthat restrict dividend payments or authorize\nregulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow\nof funds from those subsidiaries to us.\nRestrictions or regulatory action of\nthat kind could impede access to funds that we\nneed to make payments on our obligations,\nincluding debt obligations. Because some of\nour subsidiaries, including from time to time\nsome of our principal operating subsidiaries,\nare partnerships in\nwhich we are a general partner or the sole\nlimited partner, we may be liable for their\nobligations. We also guarantee many of the\nobligations of our subsidiaries. Any liability\nwe may have for our subsidiaries\u0092 obligations\ncould reduce our\nassets that are available to satisfy our\ndirect creditors, including investors in our\nsecurities.\n\nThis Section Is Only a Summary\n\nThe debt indentures and their associated\ndocuments contain the full legal text of the\nmatters described in this section and in your\nprospectus\nsupplement. We have filed copies of the debt\nindentures with the SEC as exhibits to our\nregistration statement, of which this\nprospectus is a part. See \u0093Available\nInformation\u0094 above for information on how to\nobtain copies of them.\n\nThis section and your prospectus supplement\nsummarize all the material terms of the debt\nindentures, where applicable, and your debt\nsecurity. They do\nnot, however, describe every aspect of the\ndebt indentures and your debt security. For\nexample, in this section and your prospectus\n\n16\n\nsupplement, we use terms that have been given\nspecial meaning in the debt indentures, but we\ndescribe the meaning for only the more\nimportant of those terms. Your prospectus\nsupplement will have\na more detailed description of the specific\nterms of your debt security.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe debt indentures are, and the debt\nsecurities will be, governed by New York law.\n\nCurrency of Debt Securities\n\nAmounts that\nbecome due and payable on your debt security\nin cash will be payable in a currency,\ncomposite currency, basket of currencies or\ncurrency unit or units specified in your\nprospectus supplement. We refer to this\ncurrency, composite currency, basket of\ncurrencies or currency unit or units as a\n\u0093specified currency\u0094. The specified currency\nfor your debt security will be U.S. dollars,\nunless your prospectus supplement states\notherwise. Some debt securities may have\ndifferent specified\ncurrencies for principal and interest. You\nwill have to pay for your debt securities by\ndelivering the requisite amount of the\nspecified currency for the principal to GS&Co.\nor another firm that we name in your\nprospectus supplement, unless\nother arrangements have been made between you\nand us or you and GS&Co. We will make payments\non your debt securities in the specified\ncurrency, except as described below in \u0093\u0097\nPayment Mechanics for Debt Securities\u0094. See\n\u0093Considerations Relating to Securities\nDenominated or Payable in or Linked to a\nNon-U.S. Dollar Currency\u0094 below for more\ninformation about risks of investing in debt\nsecurities of this kind.\n\nForm of Debt Securities\n\nWe will issue each\ndebt security in global \u0097 i.e., book-entry \u0097\nform only, unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. Debt\nsecurities in book-entry form will be\nrepresented by a global security registered in\nthe name of a\ndepositary, which will be the holder of all\nthe debt securities represented by the global\nsecurity. Those who own beneficial interests\nin a global debt security will do so through\nparticipants in the depositary\u0092s securities\nclearing system, and\nthe rights of these indirect owners will be\ngoverned solely by the applicable procedures\nof the depositary and its participants. We\ndescribe book-entry securities below under\n\u0093Legal Ownership and Book-Entry Issuance\u0094.\n\nIn addition, we will generally issue each debt\nsecurity in registered form, without coupons.\n\nTypes of Debt Securities\n\nWe may issue any of\nthe three types of senior debt securities or\nsubordinated debt securities described below.\nA debt security may have elements of each of\nthe three types of debt securities described\nbelow. For example, a debt security may bear\ninterest at a fixed\nrate for some periods and at a floating rate\nin others. Similarly, a debt security may\nprovide for a payment of principal at maturity\nlinked to an index and also bear interest at a\nfixed or floating rate.\n\nFixed Rate Debt Securities\n\nA debt security of this\ntype will bear interest at a fixed rate\ndescribed in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. This type includes zero coupon\ndebt securities, which bear no interest and\nare instead issued at a price lower than the\nprincipal amount. See \u0093\u0097\nOriginal Issue Discount Debt Securities\u0094 below\nfor more information about zero coupon and\nother original issue discount debt securities.\n\nEach\nfixed rate debt security, except any zero\ncoupon debt security, will bear interest from\nits original issue date or from the most\nrecent date to which interest on the debt\nsecurity has been paid or\n\n17\n\nmade available for payment. Interest will\naccrue on the principal of a fixed rate debt\nsecurity at the fixed rate per annum stated in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement, until\nthe principal is paid or made available for\npayment or the debt security is converted or\nexchanged. Interest due on each interest\npayment date and at maturity will be\ncalculated as described below under \u0093\u0097\nCalculations of Interest on Debt Securities\u0094.\nWe will pay interest on each interest payment\ndate and at maturity as described below under\n\u0093\u0097 Payment Mechanics for Debt Securities\u0094. If\nyour debt security is a zero coupon debt\nsecurity, the applicable prospectus supplement\nmay specify the original issue discount and\nthe information necessary to determine the\naccreted value. The accreted value will be (1)\nas of any date prior to the stated maturity,\nan amount equal to the sum of (A) the original\nissue price of your debt security and (B) the\nportion of the excess of the principal amount\nof your debt security over the original issue\nprice that shall have been accreted from the\noriginal issue price on a daily basis and\ncompounded annually on a date specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, up to and\nincluding the stated maturity, at a rate that\nwill be specified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement from the original issue date,\ncomputed on the basis of the day count\nfraction set forth in your prospectus\nsupplement; and (2) as of any date on or after\nthe stated maturity, the principal amount of\nyour debt security. Floating Rate Debt\nSecurities A debt security of this type will\nbear interest at rates that are determined by\nreference to an interest rate formula. In some\ncases, the rates may also be adjusted by\nadding or subtracting a spread or multiplying\nby a spread multiplier and may be subject to a\nminimum rate or a maximum rate. The various\ninterest rate formulas and these other\nfeatures are described below in \u0093\u0097\nCalculations of Interest on Debt Securities \u0097\nFloating Rate Debt Securities\u0094. If your debt\nsecurity is a floating rate debt security, the\nformula and any adjustments that apply to the\ninterest rate will be specified in your\nprospectus supplement. Interest due on each\ninterest payment date and at maturity will be\ncalculated as described below under \u0093\u0097\nCalculations of Interest on Debt Securities\u0094.\nWe will pay interest on each interest payment\ndate and at maturity as described below under\n\u0093\u0097 Payment Mechanics for Debt Securities\u0094.\nIndexed Debt Securities A debt security of\nthis type provides that the principal amount\npayable at its maturity, and/or the amount of\ninterest payable on an interest payment date,\nwill be determined by reference to:\n                                          \n      securities of one or more issuers;  \n                                          \n                               \n      one or more currencies;  \n                               \n                                \n      one or more commodities;  \n                                \n                                              \n      any other financial, economic or other  \n      measure or instrument, including the    \n      occurrence or                           \n      non-occurrence of any event or          \n      circumstance;                           \n                                              \n                                   \n      one or more indices; and/or  \n                                   \n                                              \n      one or more baskets of the items        \n      described above.                        \n                                              \nAn indexed debt security may provide either\nfor cash settlement or for physical settlement\nby delivery of the underlying security or\nanother property of the type listed above. An\nindexed debt security may also provide that\nthe form of settlement may be determined at\nour option or at the holder\u0092s option. Some\nindexed debt securities may be convertible,\nexercisable or exchangeable, at our option or\nthe holder\u0092s option, into or for securities of\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. or an issuer\nother than The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. 18\n\nAn indexed debt security may bear interest at\na fixed or floating rate, if specified in your\nprospectus supplement. Unless otherwise\nindicated in your prospectus supplement,\nindexed debt securities that bear interest at\na fixed rate will bear interest as described\nabove under \u0093\u0097 Fixed Rate Debt Securities\u0094 and\nindexed debt securities that bear interest at\na floating rate will bear interest as\ndescribed above under \u0093\u0097 Floating Rate Debt\nSecurities\u0094. If you purchase an indexed debt\nsecurity, your prospectus supplement will\ninclude information about the relevant index\nor indices, about how amounts that are to\nbecome payable will be determined by reference\nto the price or value of that index or indices\nand about the terms on which the security may\nbe settled physically or in cash. Your\nprospectus supplement will also identify the\ncalculation agent that will calculate the\namounts payable with respect to the indexed\ndebt security and will have sole discretion in\ndoing so. The calculation agent may be GS&Co.\nor another of our affiliates. See\n\u0093Considerations Relating to Indexed\nSecurities\u0094 for more information about risks\nof investing in debt securities of this type.\nOriginal Issue Discount Debt Securities A\nfixed rate debt security, a floating rate debt\nsecurity or an indexed debt security may be an\noriginal issue discount debt security. A debt\nsecurity of this type is issued at a price\nlower than its principal amount and may\nprovide that, upon redemption or acceleration\nof its maturity, an amount less than its\nprincipal amount may be payable. An original\nissue discount debt security may be a zero\ncoupon debt security. A debt security issued\nat a discount to its principal may, for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, be considered an\noriginal issue discount debt security,\nregardless of the amount payable upon\nredemption or acceleration of maturity. See\n\u0093United States Taxation \u0097 Taxation of Debt\nSecurities \u0097 United States Holders \u0097 Original\nIssue Discount\u0094 below for a brief description\nof the U.S. federal income tax consequences of\nowning an original issue discount debt\nsecurity.

A market-making\ntransaction is one in which GS&Co. or another\nof our affiliates resells a security that it\nhas previously acquired from another holder. A\nmarket-making transaction in a particular\nsecurity occurs after the original issuance\nand sale of the security. See \u0093Plan of\nDistribution\u0094 below. Calculations of Interest\non Debt Securities Interest Rates and\nInterest.Fixed rate debt securities will have\nthe interest rate stated in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. For each floating rate\ndebt security, the calculation agent will\ndetermine, on the corresponding interest\ncalculation or interest determination date, as\ndescribed below or in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, the interest rate that\ntakes effect on each interest reset date. Upon\nthe request of the holder of any floating rate\ndebt security, the calculation agent will\nprovide for that debt security the interest\nrate then in effect \u0097 and, if determined, the\ninterest rate that will become effective on\nthe next interest reset date. The calculation\nagent\u0092s determination of any interest rate,\nand its calculation of the amount of interest\nfor any interest period, will be final and\nbinding in the absence of manifest error. In\n20\n\ndetermining the base rate that applies to a\nfloating rate debt security issued prior to\nJuly 1, 2020 during a particular interest\nperiod, the calculation agent may obtain rate\nquotes from various banks or dealers active in\nthe relevant market, as described below or in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement. Those\nreference banks and dealers may include the\ncalculation agent itself and its affiliates,\nas well as any underwriter, dealer or agent\nparticipating in the distribution of the\nrelevant floating rate debt securities and its\naffiliates, and they may include affiliates of\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. The references\nbelow to provisions of the 2006 ISDA\nDefinitions refer to the referenced provisions\nas published by the International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association, without regard to any\nsubsequent amendments or supplements (the\n\u00932006 ISDA Definitions\u0094). The calculation\nagent (in the case of floating rate debt\nsecurities) or the paying agent, which may be\nthe indenture trustee (in the case of fixed\nrate debt securities) will calculate the\namount of interest that has accrued during\neach interest period \u0097 i.e., the period from\nand including the original issue date, or the\nlast date to which interest has been paid\n(which may be an interest payment date,\ndepending on the business day convention that\napplies to your debt securities), to but\nexcluding the next date to which interest will\nbe paid (which may be an interest payment\ndate, depending on the business day convention\nthat applies to your debt securities, as\ndescribed under \u0093\u0097 Business Day Conventions\u0094\nbelow). For each interest period, the agent\nwill calculate the amount of accrued interest\nby multiplying the principal amount or face\namount of the debt security, as applicable, by\nan accrued interest factor for the interest\nperiod. The accrued interest factor will be\ndetermined by multiplying the per annum fixed\nrate or floating rate, as applicable, by a\nfactor resulting from the day count convention\nspecified below or in your prospectus\nsupplement, which may include the following:\n                                              \n      If \u00931/1 (ISDA)\u0094 or \u00931/1\u0094 is specified, the  \n      factor will be equal to 1, as           \n      described in                            \n      Section\u00a04.16(a) of the 2006 ISDA        \n      Definitions.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      If \u0093Actual/Actual\u0094, \u0093Actual/Actual         \n      (ISDA)\u0094, \u0093Act/Act\u0094 or \u0093Act/Act (ISDA)\u0094 is    \n      specified, the factor will be equal to  \n      the actual number of days in the        \n      interest period divided by 365 (or, if  \n      any portion of that interest period     \n      falls in a leap year, the sum of (1)\u00a0   \n      the actual number of days in that       \n      portion of the interest                 \n      period falling in a leap year divided   \n      by 366 and (2)\u00a0the actual number of     \n      days in that portion of the interest    \n      period falling in a non-leap year       \n      divided by 365), as described in        \n      Section\u00a04.16(b) of                      \n      the 2006 ISDA Definitions.              \n                                              \n                                              \n      If \u0093Actual/Actual (ICMA)\u0094 or \u0093Act/Act      \n      (ICMA)\u0094 is specified, the factor will    \n      be equal to the number of               \n      days in the interest period, including  \n      February\u00a029 in a leap year, divided by  \n      the product of (1)\u00a0the actual number    \n      of days in such interest period and     \n      (2)\u00a0the number of interest periods in   \n      the year, as described in               \n      Section\u00a04.16(c) of the 2006 ISDA        \n      Definitions.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      If \u0093Actual/365 (Fixed)\u0094, \u0093Act/365          \n      (Fixed)\u0094, \u0093A/365 (Fixed)\u0094 or \u0093A/365F\u0094 is     \n      specified, the factor will be equal to  \n      the actual number of days in the        \n      interest period divided by 365, as      \n      described in Section\u00a04.16(d) of the     \n      2006 ISDA Definitions.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      If \u0093Actual/360 (ISDA)\u0094, \u0093Act/360 (ISDA)\u0094,   \n      \u0093A/360 (ISDA)\u0094, \u0093Actual/360\u0094,               \n      \u0093Act/360\u0094 or \u0093A/360\u0094 is specified, the      \n      factor will be equal to the actual      \n      number of days in the interest period   \n      divided by 360, as described in         \n      Section\u00a04.16(e) of the 2006 ISDA        \n      Definitions.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      If \u009330/360 (ISDA)\u0094, \u0093360/360 (ISDA)\u0094, \u0093Bond  \n      Basis (ISDA)\u0094, \u009330/360\u0094,                   \n      \u0093360/360\u0094 or \u0093Bond Basis\u0094 is specified,     \n      the factor will be equal to the number  \n      of days in the interest period in       \n      respect of which payment is being made  \n      divided by 360, calculated on a         \n      formula basis as follows, as described  \n      in                                      \n      Section\u00a04.16(f) of the 2006 ISDA        \n      Definitions:                            \n                                              \n[360 \u00d7 (Y2 \u0096 Y1)] + [30 \u00d7 (M2 \u0096 M1)] + (D2 \u0096\nD1) 360 21\n\nwhere: \u0093Y1\u0094 is the year, expressed as a\nnumber, in which the first day of the interest\nperiod falls;

All amounts used in or\nresulting from any\ncalculation relating to any debt security will\nbe rounded upward or downward, as appropriate,\nto the nearest cent, in the case of U.S.\ndollars, or to the nearest corresponding\nhundredth of a unit, in the case of a currency\nother than U.S. dollars,\nwith one-half cent or one-half of a\ncorresponding hundredth of a unit or more\nbeing rounded upward.\n\nInterest Reset Dates and Determining the New\nRate. The rate of interest on floating rate\ndebt securities will be reset daily, weekly,\nmonthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually,\ndepending on your rate and the terms of your\ndebt security. The date on which the interest\nrate resets and the new interest rate becomes\neffective is called the interest reset date.\nInterest reset dates\nare subject to adjustment, as described below\nunder \u0093\u0097 Business Day Conventions\u0094.\n\nThe interest rate that takes effect on a\nparticular interest reset date will be\ndetermined by the calculation agent for\ncertain base rates by reference to a\nparticular date called an interest\ndetermination date and, in any event, no later\nthan the business day prior to the interest\nreset\ndate. The calculation agent need not wait\nuntil the business day prior to the reset date\nto determine the interest rate if the rate\ninformation it needs to make the determination\nis available from the relevant sources sooner.\nThe base rate in effect\nfrom and including the original issue date to\nbut excluding the first interest reset date\n(\u0093the initial interest period\u0094) will be the\ninitial base rate, which will be specified in\nyour prospectus supplement. For floating rate\ndebt\nsecurities that reset daily or weekly, the\nbase rate in effect for each day following the\nfifth business day before an interest payment\ndate to, but excluding, the interest payment\ndate, and for each day following the fifth\nbusiness day before the\nmaturity to, but excluding, the maturity, will\nbe the base rate in effect on that fifth\nbusiness day.\n\nInterest Payment Dates.Subject\nto any applicable business day convention as\ndescribed under \u0093\u0097 Business Day Conventions\u0094\nbelow, interest on your debt securities will\nbe paid on the interest payment dates. The\ninterest payment dates will be specified in\nyour\nprospectus supplement. If debt securities are\noriginally issued after the regular record\ndate and before the date that would otherwise\nbe the first interest payment date, the first\ninterest payment date will be the date that\nwould otherwise be the\nsecond interest payment date. We have defined\nthe term \u0093regular record date\u0094 under \u0093\u0097\nPayment Mechanics for Debt Securities\u0094.\n\n23\n\nBusiness Day Conventions.If your prospectus\nsupplement specifies that one of the following\nbusiness day conventions is applicable to your\ndebt security, the interest payment dates,\ninterest reset dates and interest periods for\nyour debt securities will be affected (and,\nconsequently, may be adjusted) as described\nbelow, except that any payment due at maturity\n(including any interest payment) will not be\naffected as described below:\n                                              \n      \u0093Following business day convention\u0094       \n      means, for any relevant date other      \n      than the maturity, if such              \n      date would otherwise fall on a day      \n      that is not a business day, then such   \n      date will be postponed to the next day  \n      that is a business day.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      \u0093Modified following business day         \n      convention\u0094 means, for any relevant      \n      date other than the maturity,           \n      if such date would otherwise fall on a  \n      day that is not a business day, then    \n      such date will be postponed to the      \n      next day that is a business day,        \n      except that, if the next business day   \n      falls in the next calendar month, then  \n      such date will be advanced              \n      to the immediately preceding day that   \n      is a business day.                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      \u0093Following unadjusted business day       \n      convention\u0094 means, for any interest      \n      payment date, other than the            \n      maturity, that falls on a day that is   \n      not a business day, any payment due on  \n      such interest payment date will be      \n      postponed to the next day that is a     \n      business day; provided that interest    \n      due with respect to such interest       \n      payment date shall not accrue           \n      from and including such interest        \n      payment date to and including the date  \n      of payment of such interest as so       \n      postponed.

Initial Base Rate.Unless otherwise\nspecified in yourprospectus supplement, for\nfloating rate debt securities other than SOFR\ndebt securities, the initial base rate will be\nthe applicable base rate in effect from and\nincluding the original issue date to but\nexcluding the initial interest reset date. We\nwill specify the initial base rate in your\nprospectus supplement. Spread or Spread\nMultiplier .In some cases, the base rate for\nfloating rate debt securities may be adjusted:\n                                              \n      by adding or subtracting a specified    \n      number of basis points, called the      \n      spread, with one basis point being      \n      0.01%;                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      by multiplying the base rate by a       \n      specified percentage, called the        \n      spread multiplier; or                   \n                                              \n                                          \n      by a combination of the foregoing.  \n                                          \n25\n\nIf you purchase floating rate debt securities,\nyour prospectus supplement will specify\nwhether a spread or spread multiplier will\napply to your debt securities and, if so, the\namount of the applicable spread or spread\nmultiplier. Maximum and Minimum Rates.The\nactual interest rate, after being adjusted by\nthe spread or spread multiplier, may also be\nsubject to either or both of the following\nlimits:\n                                              \n      a maximum rate \u0097 i.e., a specified       \n      upper limit that the actual interest    \n      rate in effect at any time may not      \n      exceed;                                 \n      and/or                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      a minimum rate \u0097 i.e., a specified       \n      lower limit that the actual interest    \n      rate in effect at any time may not      \n      fall below.                             \n                                              \nIf you purchase floating rate debt securities,\nyour prospectus supplement will specify\nwhether a maximum rate and/or minimum rate\nwill apply to your debt securities and, if so,\nwhat those rates are. Whether or not a maximum\nrate applies, the interest rate on floating\nrate debt securities will in no event be\nhigher than the maximum rate permitted by New\nYork law, as it may be modified by U.S. law of\ngeneral application. Under current New York\nlaw, the maximum rate of interest, with some\nexceptions, for any loan in an amount less\nthan $250,000 is 16% and for any loan in the\namount of $250,000 or more but less than\n$2,500,000 is 25%, per year on a simple\ninterest basis. These limits do not apply to\nloans of $2,500,000 or more. Interest\nDetermination Dates .The interest rate that\ntakes effect on an interest reset date will be\ndetermined by the calculation agent for\ncertain base rates by reference to a\nparticular date called an interest\ndetermination date for floating rate debt\nsecurities other than SOFR debt securities.\nExcept as otherwise specified in your\nprospectus supplement:\n                                              \n      For CMS rate debt securities and CMT    \n      rate debt securities, the interest      \n      determination date relating to a        \n      particular                              \n      interest reset date will be the second  \n      U.S. Government securities business     \n      day preceding the interest reset date.  \n                                              \n                                              \n      For LIBOR debt securities, the          \n      interest determination date relating    \n      to a particular interest reset date     \n      will be the second                      \n      London business day preceding the       \n      interest reset date, unless the index   \n      currency is pounds sterling, in which   \n      case the interest determination date    \n      will be the interest reset date. We     \n      refer to an interest determination      \n      date for LIBOR debt securities as a     \n      LIBOR interest determination date.      \n                                              \n                                              \n      For EURIBOR debt securities, the        \n      interest determination date relating    \n      to a particular interest reset date     \n      will be the                             \n      second euro business day preceding the  \n      interest reset date. We refer to an     \n      interest determination date for         \n      EURIBOR debt securities as a EURIBOR    \n      interest determination date.            \n                                              \nSources and Corrections .If we refer to a rate\nas set forth on a display page, other\npublished source, information vendor or other\nvendor officially designated by the sponsor of\nthat rate, if there is a successor source for\nthe display page, other published source,\ninformation vendor or other official vendor,\nwe refer to that successor source as\napplicable as determined by the calculation\nagent. When we refer to a particular heading\nor headings on any of those sources, those\nreferences include any successor or\nreplacement heading or headings as determined\nby the calculation agent. If the applicable\nrate is based on information obtained from a\nRefinitiv page, that rate will be subject to\nthe corrections, if any, published on that\nRefinitiv page within one hour of the time\nthat rate was first displayed on such source.\nIf the applicable rate is based on information\nobtained from H.15 Daily Update, that rate\nwill be subject to the corrections, if any,\npublished by that source within 30 days of the\nday that rate was first published in that\nsource. 26\n\nCMS Rate.\n\nFor floating rate debt securities issued on or\nafter July 1, 2020 for which the base rate is\nCMS rate, unless otherwise specified in your\nprospectus\nsupplement, the CMS rate will be the offered\nrate appearing on the Refinitiv page ICESWAP1\nfor U.S. dollar swaps having a maturity equal\nto the index maturity specified in your\nprospectus supplement as of approximately\n11:00 A.M., New\nYork City time, on the relevant interest\ndetermination date. If the CMS rate cannot be\ndetermined as described above, the following\nprocedures will apply in determining the CMS\nrate:\n\nIf the calculation agent determines on the\nrelevant interest determination date that the\nCMS rate has been discontinued, then the\ncalculation agent will\nuse a substitute or successor rate that it has\ndetermined in its sole discretion is most\ncomparable to the CMS rate, provided that if\nthe calculation agent determines there is an\nindustry-accepted successor rate, then the\ncalculation agent shall use\nsuch successor rate. If the calculation agent\nhas determined a substitute or successor rate\nin accordance with the foregoing, the\ncalculation agent in its sole discretion may\ndetermine the definition of business day and\nthe relevant interest\ndetermination date to be used, and any other\nrelevant methodology for calculating such\nsubstitute or successor rate, including any\nadjustment factor needed to make such\nsubstitute or successor rate comparable to the\nCMS rate, in a manner that is\nconsistent with any industry-accepted\npractices for such substitute or successor\nrate.\n\nUnless the calculation agent uses a substitute\nor successor\nrate as so provided, if the CMS rate cannot be\ndetermined in the manner described above on\nthe interest determination date, the CMS rate\nwill be determined by the calculation agent,\nafter consulting such sources as it deems\ncomparable to the\nforegoing display page, or any other source it\ndeems reasonable, in its sole discretion.\n\nFor floating rate debt securities issued prior\nto July 1, 2020 for which the base rate is CMS\nrate, unless\notherwise specified in your prospectus\nsupplement, the CMS rate for the relevant\ninterest reset date will be the rate appearing\non the Refinitiv page ICESWAP1 for U.S. dollar\nswaps having a maturity equal to the index\nmaturity specified in your\nprospectus supplement as of approximately\n11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the\nrelevant interest determination date. If the\nCMS rate cannot be determined in this manner,\nthen:\n\nThe CMS rate for the relevant interest reset\ndate will be determined on the basis of the\nmid-market semi-annual\nswap rate quotations provided by five leading\nswap dealers in the New York City interbank\nmarket at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York\nCity time, on the relevant interest\ndetermination date. For this purpose, the\nsemi-annual swap rate means the mean\nof the bid and offered rates for the semi-\nannual fixed leg, calculated on a 30/360\n(ISDA) day count basis, of a fixed-for-\nfloating U.S. dollar interest rate swap\ntransaction with a term equal to the specified\nindex maturity, commencing on the relevant\ninterest reset date, with an acknowledged\ndealer of good credit in the swap market,\nwhere the floating leg, calculated on an\nActual/360 (ISDA) day count basis,\nis equivalent to LIBOR with a designated\nmaturity of three months, as such rate may be\ndetermined in accordance with the provisions\nset forth below under \u0093\u0097 LIBOR\u0094. The\ncalculation agent will select the five swap\ndealers in its sole\ndiscretion and will request the principal New\nYork City office of each of those dealers to\nprovide a quotation of its rate.\n\nIf at least three\nquotations are provided, the CMS rate for that\ninterest reset date will be the arithmetic\nmean of the quotations described above,\neliminating the highest and lowest quotations\nor, in the event of equality, one of the\nhighest and one of the lowest\nquotations.\n\n27\n\nIf fewer than three quotations are provided,\nthe calculation agent will determine the CMS\nrate in its sole discretion. CMT Rate.\nFloating Rate Debt Securities Issued on or\nafter July 1, 2020 For floating rate debt\nsecurities issued on or after July 1, 2020 for\nwhich the base rate is CMT rate, unless\notherwise specified in your prospectus\nsupplement, the manner in which the CMT rate\nis determined for the relevant interest reset\ndate will depend on the designated CMT\nRefinitiv pagethat is specified for the debt\nin the applicable prospectus supplement. If no\ndesignated CMT Refinitiv page is specified,\nRefinitiv page FRBCMT will be the designated\nCMT Refinitiv page for the debt securities. If\nthe designated CMT Refinitiv page for your\nfloating rate debt securities is FRBCMT, the\nCMT rate for the relevant interest reset date\nwill be the yield for Treasury securities at\n\u0093constant maturity\u0094 for a period of the\ndesignated CMT index maturityas published by\nthe Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,\nor its successor, on its website or in another\nrecognized electronic source, in each case as\ndetermined by the calculation agent in its\nsole discretion, as such yield is displayed on\nthe designated CMT Refinitiv page on the\ninterest determination date. If the applicable\nrate described above is not displayed on the\ndesignated CMT Refinitiv page, then the CMT\nrate will be the Treasury constant maturity\nrate for the designated CMT index maturity as\npublished by the Federal Reserve System Board\nof Governors, or its successor, on its website\nor in another recognized electronic source, in\neach case as determined by the calculation\nagent in its sole discretion. If the rate\ndescribed in the preceding paragraph does not\nappear on the website of the Federal Reserve\nSystem Board of Governors or in another\nrecognized electronic source, in each case as\ndetermined by the calculation agent in its\nsole discretion, then the CMT rate for the\nrelevant interest reset date will be the\nTreasury constant maturity rate for the\ndesignated CMT index maturity that:\n                                              \n      is published by the Board of Governors  \n      of the Federal Reserve System or the    \n      U.S. Department of the Treasury; and    \n                                              \n                                              \n      is determined by the calculation agent  \n      to be comparable to the applicable      \n      rate that would otherwise have been     \n      published on                            \n      the website of the Federal Reserve      \n      System Board of Governors or in         \n      another recognized electronic source,   \n      in each case as determined by the       \n      calculation agent in its sole           \n      discretion.                             \n                                              \nIf, on the relevant interest determination\ndate, the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System or the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury does not publish a yield on Treasury\nsecurities at \u0093constant maturity\u0094 for the\ndesignated CMT index maturity, after\nconsulting such sources as it deems comparable\nto any of the foregoing display pages, or any\nsuch source as it deems reasonable from which\nto estimate the CMT rate, the calculation\nagent shall determine the CMT rate in its sole\ndiscretion, provided that if the calculation\nagent determines there is an industry-accepted\nsuccessor CMT rate, then the calculation agent\nshall use such successor rate. If the\ncalculation agent has determined a substitute\nor successor rate in accordance with the\nforegoing, the calculation agent in its sole\ndiscretion may determine the business day\nconvention, the definition of business day and\nthe interest determination date to be used and\nany other relevant methodology for calculating\nsuch substitute or successor rate, including\nany adjustment factor needed to make such\nsubstitute or successor rate comparable to the\nCMT rate, in a manner that is consistent with\nany industry-accepted practices for such\nsubstitute or successor rate. If the\ndesignated CMT Refinitiv page for the floating\nrate debt securities issued on or after July\n1, 2020 is FEDCMT, the CMT rate for the\nrelevant interest reset date will be the\naverage of the yields for the five business\ndays for Treasury securities at \u0093constant\nmaturity\u0094 for a period of the designated CMT\n28\n\nindex maturity as set forth on the website of\nthe Federal Reserve System Board of Governors\nor in another recognized electronic source, in\neach case as determined by the calculation\nagent in its\nsole discretion, as such yields are displayed\non the designated CMT Refinitiv page on the\nrelevant interest reset date.\n\nIf the applicable average\ndescribed above is not displayed on the\ndesignated CMT Refinitiv page, then the CMT\nrate for the relevant interest reset date will\nbe the average of the yields for the five\nbusiness days for Treasury securities at\n\u0093constant maturity\u0094 for a\nperiod of the relevant index maturity and for\nthe five business days preceding the relevant\ninterest reset date as published on the\nwebsite of the Federal Reserve System Board of\nGovernors or in another recognized electronic\nsource, in each case as\ndetermined by the calculation agent in its\nsole discretion.\n\nIf the applicable average described in the\npreceding paragraph does not appear on the\nwebsite of the Federal Reserve System Board of\nGovernors or in another recognized electronic\nsource, in each case as determined by the\ncalculation agent in its sole discretion, then\nthe CMT rate for the relevant interest reset\ndate will be the\naverage of the five business days for Treasury\nsecurities at \u0093constant maturity\u0094 for a period\nequal to the designated CMT index maturity as\notherwise announced by the Federal Reserve\nBank of New York the five business days\npreceding the\nrelevant interest reset date.\n\nIf, on the relevant interest determination\ndate, the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System or the U.S.\nDepartment of the Treasury does not publish a\nyield on Treasury securities at \u0093constant\nmaturity\u0094 for the designated CMT index\nmaturity, after consulting such sources as it\ndeems comparable to any of the foregoing\ndisplay pages, or any\nsuch source as it deems reasonable from which\nto estimate the CMT rate, the calculation\nagent shall determine the CMT rate in its sole\ndiscretion, provided that if the calculation\nagent determines there is an industry-accepted\nsuccessor CMT rate,\nthen the calculation agent shall use such\nsuccessor rate. If the calculation agent has\ndetermined a substitute or successor rate in\naccordance with the foregoing, the calculation\nagent in its sole discretion may determine the\nbusiness day\nconvention, the definition of business day and\nthe interest determination date to be used and\nany other relevant methodology for calculating\nsuch substitute or successor rate, including\nany adjustment factor needed to make such\nsubstitute or\nsuccessor rate comparable to the CMT rate, in\na manner that is consistent with any industry-\naccepted practices for such substitute or\nsuccessor rate.\n\nFor floating rate debt securities issued prior\nto July 1, 2020 for which the base rate is CMT\nrate, unless otherwise specified in your\nprospectus\nsupplement, the manner in which the CMT rate\nis determined for the relevant interest reset\ndate will depend on the designated CMT\nRefinitiv pagethat is specified for the\nfloating rate debt securities in the\napplicable prospectus\nsupplement. If no designated CMT Refinitiv\npage is specified, Refinitiv page FRBCMT will\nbe the designated CMT Refinitiv page for the\nfloating rate debt securities.\n\nIf the designated CMT Refinitiv page for the\nfloating rate debt securities is FRBCMT, the\nCMT rate for the relevant interest reset date\nwill be the\nyield for Treasury securities at \u0093constant\nmaturity\u0094 for a period of the designated CMT\nindex maturityas published by the Federal\nReserve System Board of Governors, or its\nsuccessor, on its website or in another\nrecognized\nelectronic source, in each case as determined\nby the calculation agent in its sole\ndiscretion, as such yield is displayed on the\ndesignated CMT Refinitiv page on the interest\ndetermination date. If the applicable rate\ndescribed above is not\ndisplayed on the designated CMT Refinitiv\npage, then the CMT rate will be the Treasury\nconstant maturity rate for the designated CMT\nindex maturity as published by the Federal\nReserve System Board of Governors, or its\nsuccessor, on its website or in\nanother recognized electronic source, in each\ncase as determined by the calculation agent in\nits sole discretion.\n\n29\n\nIf the rate described in the preceding\nparagraph does not appear on the website of\nthe Federal Reserve System Board of Governors\nor in another recognized electronic source, in\neach case as determined by the calculation\nagent in its sole discretion, then the CMT\nrate for the relevant interest reset date will\nbe the Treasury constant maturity rate for the\ndesignated CMT index maturity that:\n                                              \n      is published by the Board of Governors  \n      of the Federal Reserve System or the    \n      U.S. Department of the Treasury; and    \n                                              \n                                              \n      is determined by the calculation agent  \n      to be comparable to the applicable      \n      rate that would otherwise have been     \n      published on                            \n      the website of the Federal Reserve      \n      System Board of Governors or in         \n      another recognized electronic source,   \n      in each case as determined by the       \n      calculation agent in its sole           \n      discretion.                             \n                                              \nIf, on the relevant interest determination\ndate, the rate described in the preceding\nparagraph is not published by the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System or the\nU.S. Department of Treasury, then the CMT rate\nfor the relevant interest reset date will be\nthe yield to maturity of the arithmetic mean\nof the secondary market bid rates for the most\nrecently issued U.S. Treasury securities\nhaving an original maturity of approximately\nthe designated CMT index maturity and a\nremaining term to maturity of not less than\nthe designated CMT index maturity minusone\nyear, and in a representative amount, as of\napproximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time,\non the relevant interest determination date,\nquoted by three primary U.S. government\nsecurities dealers in New York City selected\nby the calculation agent. In selecting these\nbid rates, the calculation agent will request\nquotations from five primary dealers and will\ndisregard the highest quotation \u0097 or, if there\nis equality, one of the highest \u0097 and the\nlowest quotation \u0097 or, if there is equality,\none of the lowest. If fewer than five but more\nthan two such bid rates are provided, the CMT\nrate will be based on the arithmetic mean of\nthe bid prices provided, and neither the\nhighest nor lowest of such quotations will be\neliminated. If the calculation agent is unable\nto obtain three quotations of the kind\ndescribed in the preceding paragraph, the CMT\nrate for the relevant interest reset date will\nbe the yield to maturity of the arithmetic\nmean of the secondary market bid rates for\nU.S. Treasury securities with an original\nmaturity longer than the designated CMT index\nmaturity, with a remaining term to maturity\nclosest to the designated CMT index maturity\nand in a representative amount, as of\napproximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time,\non the relevant CMT interest determination\ndate, of three primary U.S. government\nsecurities dealers in New York City selected\nby the calculation agent.

If fewer than\nfive but more than two of these primary\ndealers are quoting, then the CMT rate for the\nrelevant interest reset date will be based on\nthe arithmetic mean of the bid rates so\nobtained, and neither the highest nor the\nlowest of those quotations will be\ndisregarded. If two U.S. Treasury securities\nwith an original maturity longer than the\ndesignated CMT index maturity have remaining\nterms to maturity that are equally close to\nthe designated CMT index maturity, the\ncalculation agent will obtain quotations for\nthe U.S. Treasury securities with the shorter\noriginal term to maturity. If two or fewer\nprimary dealers selected by the calculation\nagent are quoting as described in the\npreceding paragraph, the CMT rate for the\nrelevant interest reset date will be the rate\ndetermined by the calculation agent in its\nsole discretion, after consulting such sources\nas it deems comparable to any of the foregoing\nquotations or display page, or any such source\nas it deems reasonable from which to estimate\nthe rate for U.S. Treasury securities at\nconstant maturity or any of the foregoing bid\nrates. If the designated CMT Refinitiv page\nfor the floating rate debt securities issued\nprior to July 1, 2020 is FEDCMT, the CMT rate\nfor the relevant interest reset date will be\nthe one-weekaverage yield for Treasury\nsecurities at \u0093constant maturity\u0094 for a period\nof the designated CMT index maturity as set 30\n\nforth on the website of the Federal Reserve\nSystem Board of Governors or in another\nrecognized electronic source, in each case as\ndetermined by the calculation agent in its\nsole discretion, as\nsuch yields are displayed on the designated\nCMT Refinitiv page on the relevant interest\nreset date.\n\nIf the applicable average described above is\nnot displayed on the designated CMT Refinitiv\npage, then the CMT rate for the relevant\ninterest reset date will be the one-week\naverage yield for Treasury securities at\n\u0093constant maturity\u0094 for a\nperiod of the designated CMT index maturity\nand for the week preceding the relevant\ninterest reset date as published on the\nwebsite of the Federal Reserve System Board of\nGovernors or in another recognized electronic\nsource, in each case as\ndetermined by the calculation agent in its\nsole discretion.\n\nIf the applicable average described in the\npreceding paragraph does not appear on the\nwebsite of the Federal Reserve System Board of\nGovernors or in another recognized electronic\nsource, in each case as determined by the\ncalculation agent in its sole discretion, then\nthe CMT rate for the relevant interest reset\ndate will be the one-week average yield for\nTreasury securities at \u0093constant maturity\u0094 for\na period equal to the designated CMT index\nmaturity as otherwise announced by the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York for the week\npreceding the relevant interest reset date.\n\nIf for the week preceding the relevant\ninterest reset date the Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York does\nnot publish a one-week average yield for\nTreasury securities at \u0093constant maturity\u0094 for\na period equal to the designated CMT index\nmaturity for the preceding week, then the CMT\nrate for the relevant\ninterest reset date will be the yield to\nmaturity of the arithmetic mean of the\nsecondary market bid rates for the most\nrecently issued U.S. Treasury securities\nhaving an original maturity of approximately\nthe designated CMT index maturity and a\nremaining term to maturity of not less than\nthe designated CMT index maturity minusone\nyear, and in a representative amount, as of\napproximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time,\non the relevant CMT interest determination\ndate, quoted by three\nprimary U.S. government securities dealers in\nNew York City selected by the calculation\nagent. In selecting these bid rates, the\ncalculation agent will request quotations from\nfive primary dealers and will disregard the\nhighest quotation \u0097 or,\nif there is equality, one of the highest \u0097 and\nthe lowest quotation \u0097 or, if there is\nequality, one of the lowest. If fewer than\nfive but more than two such bid rates are\nprovided, the CMT rate will be based on the\narithmetic mean of the\nbid prices provided, and neither the highest\nnor lowest of such quotations will be\neliminated.\n\nIf the calculation agent is unable to obtain\nthree\nquotations of the kind described in the\npreceding paragraph, the CMT rate for the\nrelevant interest reset date will be the yield\nto maturity of the arithmetic mean of the\nsecondary market bid rates for U.S. Treasury\nsecurities with an original\nmaturity longer than the designated CMT index\nmaturity, with a remaining term to maturity\nclosest to the designated CMT index maturity\nand in a representative amount, as of\napproximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time,\non the relevant CMT interest\ndetermination date, of three primary U.S.\ngovernment securities dealers in New York City\nselected by the calculation agent. In\nselecting these bid rates, the calculation\nagent will request quotations from five of\nthese primary dealers and will\ndisregard the highest quotation \u0097 or, if there\nis equality, one of the highest \u0097 and the\nlowest quotation \u0097 or, if there is equality,\none of the lowest. If fewer than five but more\nthan two of these primary dealers are quoting,\nthen\nthe CMT rate for the relevant interest reset\ndate will be based on the arithmetic mean of\nthe bid rates so obtained, and neither the\nhighest nor the lowest of those quotations\nwill be disregarded. If two U.S. Treasury\nsecurities with an original\nmaturity longer than the designated CMT index\nmaturity have remaining terms to maturity that\nare equally close to the designated CMT index\nmaturity, the calculation agent will obtain\nquotations for the U.S. Treasury securities\nwith the shorter\noriginal term to maturity.\n\nIf two or fewer primary dealers selected by\nthe calculation agent are quoting as described\nin the preceding paragraph,\nthe CMT rate for the relevant interest reset\ndate will be the rate determined by\n\n31\n\nthe calculation agent in its sole discretion,\nafter consulting such sources as it deems\ncomparable to any the foregoing quotations or\ndisplay page, or any such source as it deems\nreasonable from\nwhich to estimate of the one-week average for\nU.S. Treasury securities at constant maturity\nor any of the foregoing bid rates.\n\nEURIBOR.For floating rate debt securities\nissued prior to July 1, 2020 for which the\nbase rate is EURIBOR, EURIBOR will be\nthe offered rate for deposits in euros having\nthe index maturity specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, as that rate appears on\nthe Refinitiv page EURIBOR01 as of\napproximately 11:00 A.M., Brussels time, on\nthe relevant interest\ndetermination date.\n\nIf the rate described above does not so appear\non the Refinitiv page EURIBOR01, EURIBOR will\nbe determined on the basis of the\nrates at which deposits in euros are offered\nby four major banks in the euro-zoneinterbank\nmarket, at approximately 11:00 A.M., Brussels\ntime, on the relevant EURIBOR interest\ndetermination date, to prime banks in the\neuro-zoneinterbank market for a period of the\nspecified index maturity commencing on the\nrelevant interest reset date and in a\nrepresentative amount, assuming an Actual/360\n(ISDA) day count basis. The calculation agent\nwill request the principal\neuro-zone office of each of these four banks\nto provide a quotation of its rate. If at\nleast two quotations are provided, EURIBOR for\nthe relevant interest reset date will be the\narithmetic mean of the quotations.\n\nIf fewer than two quotations are provided as\ndescribed in the preceding paragraph, EURIBOR\nfor the relevant interest reset date will be\nthe arithmetic\nmean of the rates quoted by major banks in the\neuro-zone, selected by the calculation agent\nat approximately 11:00 A.M., Brussels time, on\nthat interest reset date, for loans of euros\nto leading European banks for the specified\nindex maturity,\nbeginning on the relevant interest reset date,\nand in a representative amount.\n\nIf no quotation is provided as described in\nthe preceding paragraph,\nthen the calculation agent, after consulting\nsuch sources as it deems comparable to any of\nthe foregoing quotations or display page, or\nany such source as it deems reasonable from\nwhich to estimate EURIBOR or any of the\nforegoing lending rates,\nshall determine EURIBOR for that interest\nreset date in its sole discretion.\n\nFederal Funds Rate.For floating rate debt\nsecurities issued prior to July 1, 2020 for\nwhich the base rate is federal funds rate, the\napplicable prospectus supplement describes how\nfederal funds rate is determined.\n\nIn respect of future floating rate debt\nsecurities issued on or after July 1, 2020 for\nwhich the base rate is federal funds rate,\nfederal funds\nrate will be will be the rate for U.S. dollar\nfederal funds on the relevant interest reset\ndate, as set forth in H.15 Daily Update\nopposite the heading \u0093Federal funds\n(effective)\u0094, as that rate is displayed on the\nRefinitiv\npage FEDFUNDS1 for that day.\n\nIf, by approximately 5:00 P.M., New York City\ntime, on the day that is one New York City\nbanking day following the\nrelevant interest reset date, the federal\nfunds (effective) rate for the relevant\ninterest reset date does not appears on\nRefinitiv page FEDFUNDS1, then the federal\nfunds (effective) rate, for that interest\nreset date, will be the rate published in\nH.15 Daily Update, or another recognized\nelectronic source used for displaying that\nrate, under the heading \u0093Federal funds\n(effective)\u0094.\n\nIf the rate cannot be determined as described\nin the preceding paragraph, then the federal\nfunds (effective) rate for the relevant\ninterest reset date\nwill be the rate for the first day preceding\nthe relevant interest reset date for which\nsuch rate is set forth in H.15 Daily Update\nopposite the heading \u0093Federal funds\n(effective)\u0094, as such rate is displayed on the\nRefinitiv page\nFEDFUNDS1.\n\nLIBOR.For floating rate debt securities issued\nprior to July 1, 2020 for which the base rate\nis LIBOR, the\napplicable prospectus supplement describes how\nLIBOR is determined.\n\n32\n\nIn respect of future floating rate debt\nsecurities issued on or after July 1, 2020 for\nwhich the base rate is LIBOR, after the\ninitial interest period, LIBOR will be the\noffered rate appearing on the Refinitiv page\nLIBOR01as of approximately 11:00 A.M., London\ntime, on the relevant interest determination\ndate, for deposits in U.S. Dollars or other\nindex currency having the relevant index\nmaturity (e.g., three months) beginning on the\nrelevant interest reset date. If the rate\ndescribed above does not so appear on the\nRefinitiv page LIBOR01, then LIBOR for that\ninterest reset date will be equal to such rate\non the interest determination date when LIBOR\nfor the relevant index maturity was last\navailable on the Refinitiv page LIBOR01, as\ndetermined by the calculation agent.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to\nfloating rate securities issued on or after\nJuly 1, 2020 for which the base rate is LIBOR,\nif the calculation agent determines that a\nbenchmark transition event and its related\nbenchmark replacement date have occurred prior\nto the reference time in respect of any\ndetermination of the benchmark on any date,\nthe benchmark replacement will replace the\nthen-current benchmark for all purposes\nrelating to the floating rate debt securities\nin respect of such determination on such date\nand all determinations on all subsequent\ndates.

As used\nin this section entitled \u0093\u0097 Calculations of\nInterest on Debt Securities \u0097 Floating Rate\nDebt Securities \u0097 LIBOR\u0094: The term \u0093benchmark\n\u0094means, initially, LIBOR for the relevant\nindex maturity; provided that if a benchmark\ntransition event and its related benchmark\nreplacement date have occurred with respect to\nLIBOR for the relevant index maturity or the\nthen-current benchmark, then \u0093benchmark\u0094 means\nthe applicable benchmark replacement. The term\n\u0093benchmark replacement\u0094 means the interpolated\nbenchmark; provided that if the calculation\nagent cannot determine the interpolated\nbenchmark as of the benchmark replacement\ndate, then \u0093benchmark replacement\u0094 means the\nfirst alternative set forth in the order below\nthat can be determined by the calculation\nagent as of the benchmark replacement date:\n(1) the sum of: (a) term SOFR and (b) the\nbenchmark replacement adjustment; (2) the sum\nof: (a) compounded SOFR and (b) the benchmark\nreplacement adjustment; 33\n\n(3) the sum of: (a) the alternate rate of\ninterest that has been selected or recommended\nby the relevant governmental body as the\nreplacement for the then-current benchmark for\nthe applicable corresponding tenor and (b) the\nbenchmark replacement adjustment; (4) the sum\nof: (a) the ISDA fallback rate and (b) the\nbenchmark replacement adjustment; (5) provided\nthat if (i) the benchmark replacement cannot\nbe determined in accordance with clause (3) or\n(4) above as of the benchmark replacement date\nor (ii) the calculation agent shall have\ndetermined that the ISDA fallback rate\ndetermined in accordance with clause (4) above\nis not an industry-accepted rate of interest\nas a replacement for the then-current\nbenchmark for U.S. dollar denominated floating\nrate debt securities at such time, then the\nbenchmark replacement shall be the sum of: (a)\nthe alternate rate of interest that has been\nselected by the calculation agent as the\nreplacement for the then current benchmark for\nthe applicable corresponding tenor giving due\nconsideration to any industry accepted rate of\ninterest as a replacement for the then-current\nbenchmark for U.S. dollar denominated floating\nrate fixed income instruments at such time and\n(b) the benchmark replacement adjustment. The\nterm \u0093benchmark replacement adjustment\u0094 means\nthe first alternative set forth in the order\nbelow that can be determined by the\ncalculation agent as of the benchmark\nreplacement date: (1) the spread adjustment\n(which may be a positive or negative value or\nzero), or method for calculating or\ndetermining such spread adjustment, that has\nbeen selected or recommended by the relevant\ngovernmental body for the applicable\nunadjusted benchmark replacement; (2) if the\napplicable unadjusted benchmark replacement is\nequivalent to the ISDA fallback rate, then the\nISDA fallback adjustment; (3) the spread\nadjustment (which may be a positive or\nnegative value or zero) that has been selected\nby the calculation agent giving due\nconsideration to any industry-accepted spread\nadjustment, or method for calculating or\ndetermining such spread adjustment, for the\nreplacement of the then-current benchmark with\nthe applicable unadjusted benchmark\nreplacement for U.S. dollar-denominated\nfloating rate fixed income instruments at such\ntime. The term \u0093benchmark replacement\nconforming changes\u0094 means, with respect to any\nbenchmark replacement, any technical,\nadministrative or operational changes\n(including changes to the definitions of\n\u0093business day\u0094 and \u0093interest period\u0094, timing\nand frequency of determining rates, and making\npayments of interest, rounding of amounts or\ntenors and other administrative matters) that\nthe calculation agent decides may be\nappropriate to reflect the adoption of such\nbenchmark replacement in a manner\nsubstantially consistent with market practice\n(or, if the calculation agent decides that\nadoption of any portion of such market\npractice is not administratively feasible or\nif the calculation agent determines that no\nmarket practice for use of the benchmark\nreplacement exists, in such other manner as\nthe calculation agent determines is reasonably\nnecessary). The term \u0093benchmark replacement\ndate\u0094 means the earliest to occur of the\nfollowing events with respect to the then-\ncurrent benchmark:\n                                              \n       in the case of clause (1)\u00a0or (2) of    \n       the definition of \u0093benchmark            \n       transition event,\u0094 the later of         \n       (a)\u00a0the date of the public statement   \n  (1)  or publication of information          \n       referenced therein and (b)\u00a0the date    \n       on which the administrator of the      \n       benchmark permanently or indefinitely  \n       ceases to provide the benchmark; or    \n                                              \n                                              \n       in the case of clause (3)\u00a0of the       \n       definition of \u0093benchmark transition     \n  (2)  event,\u0094 the date of the public          \n       statement or publication of            \n       information referenced therein.        \n                                              \n34\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, if the event\ngiving rise to the benchmark replacement date\noccurs on the same day as, but earlier than,\nthe reference time in respect of any\ndetermination, the benchmark replacement date\nwill be deemed to have occurred prior to the\nreference time for such determination. For the\navoidance of doubt, for purposes of the\ndefinitions of benchmark replacement date and\nbenchmark transition event, references to\n\u0093benchmark\u0094 also include any reference rate\nunderlying such benchmark (for example, if the\nbenchmark becomes the sum of (a) compounded\nSOFR and (b) the benchmark replacement\nadjustment in accordance with clause (2) of\nthe definition of \u0093benchmark replacement\u0094,\nreferences to benchmark would include SOFR).\nThe term \u0093benchmark transition event\u0094 means\nthe occurrence of one or more of the following\nevents with respect to the then-current\nbenchmark:\n                                              \n       a public statement or publication of   \n       information by or on behalf of the     \n       administrator of the benchmark         \n       announcing that                        \n       such administrator has ceased or will  \n  (1)  cease to provide the benchmark,        \n       permanently or indefinitely, provided  \n       that, at the time of such statement    \n       or publication, there is no successor  \n       administrator that will continue to    \n       provide the benchmark;                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       a public statement or publication of   \n       information by the regulatory          \n       supervisor for the administrator of    \n       the benchmark, the                     \n       central bank for the currency of the   \n       benchmark, an insolvency official      \n       with jurisdiction over the             \n       administrator for the benchmark, a     \n       resolution authority with              \n       jurisdiction over the administrator    \n       for the benchmark or a court or an     \n  (2)  entity with similar                    \n       insolvency or resolution authority     \n       over the administrator for the         \n       benchmark, which states that the       \n       administrator of the benchmark has     \n       ceased or will cease to provide the    \n       benchmark permanently or               \n       indefinitely, provided that, at the    \n       time of such                           \n       statement or publication, there is no  \n       successor administrator that will      \n       continue to provide the benchmark; or  \n                                              \n                                              \n       a public statement or publication of   \n       information by the regulatory          \n  (3)  supervisor for the administrator of    \n       the benchmark                          \n       announcing that the benchmark is no    \n       longer representative.                 \n                                              \nThe term \u0093compounded SOFR\u0094 means the\ncompounded average of SOFRs for the applicable\ncorresponding tenor, with the rate, or\nmethodology for this rate, and conventions for\nthis rate (which will be compounded in arrears\nwith an observation, lookback and/or\nsuspension period as a mechanism to determine\nthe interest payable prior to the end of each\ninterest period) being established by the\ncalculation agent in accordance with:\n                                              \n       the rate, or methodology for this      \n       rate, and conventions for this rate    \n  (1)  selected or recommended by the         \n       relevant                               \n       governmental body for determining      \n       compounded SOFR; provided that:        \n                                              \n                                              \n       if, and to the extent that, the        \n       calculation agent determines that      \n       compounded SOFR cannot be determined   \n       in accordance with                     \n       clause (1)\u00a0above, then the rate, or    \n       methodology for this rate, and         \n  (2)  conventions for this rate that have    \n       been selected by the calculation       \n       agent giving due consideration to any  \n       industry-accepted market practice for  \n       U.S. dollar denominated floating       \n       rate fixed income instruments at such  \n       time.                                  \n                                              \nFor the avoidance of doubt, the calculation of\ncompounded SOFR shall exclude the benchmark\nreplacement adjustment and the applicable\nmargin or spread.

If the\ncalculation agent has determined a substitute\nor successor rate in accordance with the\nforegoing, the calculation\nagent in its sole discretion may determine the\nbusiness day convention, the definition of\nbusiness day and the interest reset date to be\nused and any other relevant methodology for\ncalculating such substitute or successor rate,\nincluding any\nadjustment factor needed to make such\nsubstitute or successor rate comparable to the\ntreasury rate, in a manner that is consistent\nwith any industry-accepted practices for such\nsubstitute or successor rate.\n\nFor floating rate debt securities issued prior\nto July 1, 2020 for which the base rate is\ntreasury rate, the treasury rate for the\nrelevant interest\nreset date will be the rate for U.S.\ngovernment treasury bills, as that rate\nappears on the Refinitiv page USAUCTION10 or\nUSAUCTION11 on the relevant interest\ndetermination date, opposite the relevant\nindex maturity specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement under the heading\n\u0093INVEST RATE\u0094.\n\nIf the rate described above does not appear on\neither page on the relevant\ninterest calculation date, unless the\ncalculation is made earlier and the rate is\navailable from one of those sources at that\ntime, but U.S. government treasury bills\nhaving the specified index maturity have been\nauctioned during the relevant\ninterest period, then the treasury rate will\nbe the bond equivalent yieldof the rate, for\nthe relevant interest reset date, as published\nin H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized\nelectronic source used for displaying that\nrate, for\nthat day and for the specified index maturity,\nunder a heading indicating that such rate is\nthe \u0093auction high\u0094 rate for United States\ntreasury bills.\n\nIf the rate cannot be determined as described\nin the preceding paragraph, then the treasury\nrate will be the bond equivalent yield of the\nauction rate\nfor treasury bills with a remaining maturity\nequal to the specified index maturity as\nannounced by the United States Treasury.\n\nIf no such auction\nis held for the relevant week, the treasury\nrate will be the rate, for the relevant\ninterest reset date and for treasury bills\nhaving the specified index maturity, as\npublished in H.15 Daily Update, or another\nrecognized electronic source used for\ndisplaying that rate, under the heading \u0093U.S.\ngovernment securities/Treasury bills\n(secondary market)\u0094.\n\nIf the rate described in the\nprior paragraph does not appear in H.15 Daily\nUpdate or another recognized electronic source\non the relevant interest calculation date,\nunless the calculation is made earlier and the\nrate is available from that source at that\ntime, the treasury rate\nwill be the bond equivalent yield of the\narithmetic mean of the following secondary\nmarket bid rates for the issue of treasury\nbills with a remaining maturity closest to the\nspecified index maturity: the rates bid as of\napproximately 3:30 P.M., New\nYork City time, on the relevant interest reset\ndate, by primary U.S. government securities\ndealers in New York City selected by the\ncalculation agent.\n\n41\n\nIf no quotation is provided as described in\nthe preceding paragraph, then the calculation\nagent, after consulting such sources as it\ndeems comparable to any of the foregoing\nsecondary market bids or any display page or\nother U.S. government publication or source,\nor any other source as it deems reasonable\nfrom which to estimate the treasury bills\nauction rate or any of the foregoing secondary\nmarket bid rates, shall determine the treasury\nrate for that interest reset date in its sole\ndiscretion. Special Rate Calculation Terms.In\nthis section entitled \u0093\u0097 Floating Rate Debt\nSecurities\u0094, we use several terms that have\nspecial meanings relevant to calculating\nfloating interest rates.

Calculations relating to\ninterest on floating rate debt securities will\nbe made by the calculation agent, an\ninstitution that we appoint as our agent for\nthis purpose. That institution may include any\naffiliate of ours, such as GS&Co. The\nprospectus supplement for a particular\nfloating rate debt security or series of debt\nsecurities will name the\ninstitution that we have appointed to act as\nthe calculation agent for that debt security\nas of its original issue date. Unless\notherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, we have initially\nappointed GS&Co. as calculation agent\nfor all the floating rate debt securities that\nwe may issue hereunder. We may appoint a\ndifferent institution to serve as calculation\nagent from time to time after the original\nissue date of the debt security without your\nconsent and without\nnotifying you of the change. Absent manifest\nerror, all determinations of the calculation\nagent will be final and binding on you and us,\nwithout any liability on the part of the\ncalculation agent.\n\nRedemption and Repayment\n\nUnless otherwise\nindicated in your prospectus supplement, your\ndebt security will not be entitled to the\nbenefit of any sinking fund \u0097 that is, we will\nnot deposit money on a regular basis into any\nseparate custodial account to repay your debt\nsecurities. In\naddition, we will not be entitled to redeem\nyour debt security before its stated maturity\nunless your prospectus supplement specifies a\nredemption commencement date. You will not be\nentitled to require us to buy your debt\nsecurity from you, before\nits stated maturity, unless your prospectus\nsupplement specifies one or more repayment\ndates.\n\nIf your prospectus supplement specifies a\nredemption\ncommencement date or a repayment date, it may\nalso specify one or more redemption prices or\nrepayment prices, which may be expressed as a\npercentage of the principal amount of your\ndebt security. It may also specify one or more\nredemption periods\nduring which the redemption prices relating to\na redemption of debt securities during those\nperiods will apply.\n\nIf your prospectus supplement\nspecifies a repayment date, your debt security\nwill be repayable at the holder\u0092s option on\nthe specified repayment date at the specified\nrepayment price, together with interest\naccrued to but excluding the repayment date.\n\nIf a debt security represented by a global\ndebt security is subject to repayment at the\nholder\u0092s option, the depositary or its\nnominee, as the\nholder, will be the only person that can\nexercise the right to repayment. Any indirect\nowners who own beneficial interests in the\nglobal debt security and wish to exercise a\nrepayment right must give proper and timely\ninstructions to their banks or\nbrokers through which they hold their\ninterests, requesting that they notify the\ndepositary to exercise the repayment right on\ntheir behalf. Different firms have different\ndeadlines for accepting instructions from\ntheir customers, and you should\ntake care to act promptly enough to ensure\nthat your request is given effect by the\ndepositary before the applicable deadline for\nexercise.\n\n43\n\nTax redemption. If your prospectus supplement\nspecifies that we will pay additional amounts\nwith respect to your debt securities, as\ndescribed below under \u0093\u0097 Payment of Additional\nAmounts\u0094, we will be entitled, at our option,\nto redeem the outstanding debt securities in\nwhole and not in part if at any time we become\nobligated to pay additional amounts on your\ndebt securities on the next date on which\npayments are made, but only if our obligation\nresults from a change in the laws or\nregulations of any U.S. taxing authority (as\ndefined below in \u0093\u0097 Payment of Additional\nAmounts\u0094), or from a change in any official\ninterpretation or application of those laws or\nregulations, that becomes effective or is\nannounced on or after the date of your\nprospectus supplement, unless another date is\nspecified. If we redeem your debt securities\nbecause we have become obligated to pay\nadditional amounts, we will do so at a\nredemption price equal to 100% of the\nprincipal amount of the debt securities\nredeemed plusaccrued interest to the\nredemption date. If we become entitled to\nredeem your debt securities because we have\nbecome obligated to pay additional amounts, we\nmay do so at any time on a redemption date of\nour choice. However, we must give the holders\nof the debt securities being redeemed notice\nof the redemption not less than 30 days or\nmore than 60 days before the redemption date\nand not more than 90 days before the next date\non which we would be obligated to pay\nadditional amounts. In addition, our\nobligation to pay additional amounts must\nremain in effect when we give the notice of\nredemption. We will give the notice in the\nmanner described below under \u0093 \u0097 Notices\u0094.\nOptional redemption. If your prospectus\nsupplement specifies that redemption at our\noption is applicable to your debt securities\nand that a make-whole redemption applies, and\nunless your prospectus supplement specifies\ndifferent terms relating to redemption at our\noption or notice periods:\n                                              \n       we may redeem your debt securities in  \n       whole at any time or in part from      \n       time to time, prior to a specified     \n       final                                  \n       redemption date, upon (i)\u00a0in the case  \n       of debt securities issued prior to     \n       July\u00a01, 2020, not less than 30 days\u0092    \n       nor more than 60 days\u0092 prior written    \n       notice or (ii)\u00a0in the case of debt     \n       securities issued on or after July\u00a01,  \n       2020, not less than 15 days\u0092 nor more   \n       than 60 days\u0092 prior written notice, at  \n       a redemption price equal to the        \n       greater of (A) 100% of the principal   \n       amount of the debt securities to be    \n       redeemed or (B)\u00a0as determined by the   \n       quotation agent                        \n  (1)  described below, the sum of the        \n       present values of the remaining        \n       scheduled payments of principal and    \n       interest on the debt securities to be  \n       redeemed, not including any portion    \n       of these payments of interest accrued  \n       as of the date on which the debt       \n       securities are to be redeemed,         \n       discounted to the date on which the    \n       debt securities are to be redeemed on  \n       a semi-annual basis, applying the      \n       30/360 (ISDA) day count convention     \n       described above, at the treasury rate  \n       (as described below) plus a spread to  \n       be specified in the prospectus         \n       supplement, plus, in each case,        \n       accrued and unpaid interest to but     \n       excluding the redemption date; and     \n                                              \n                                              \n       we may redeem your debt securities in  \n       whole at any time or in part from      \n       time to time, on or after the          \n       specified final                        \n       redemption date, upon (i)\u00a0in the case  \n       of debt securities issued prior to     \n       July\u00a01, 2020, not less than 30 days\u0092    \n       nor more than 60 days\u0092 prior written    \n  (2)  notice or (ii)\u00a0in the case of debt     \n       securities issued on or after July\u00a01,  \n       2020, not less than 15 days\u0092 nor more   \n       than 60 days\u0092 prior written notice, at  \n       a redemption price equal to 100% of    \n       the principal amount of the debt       \n       securities being redeemed plus         \n       accrued and unpaid interest to but     \n       excluding the redemption               \n       date.                                  \n                                              \nIf your prospectus supplement specifies that\nredemption at our option is applicable to your\ndebt securities but does not specify that a\nmake-whole redemption applies, and unless your\nprospectus supplement specifies different\nterms relating to redemption at our option or\nnotice periods, we may redeem your debt\nsecurities in whole at any time or in part\nfrom time to time, upon (i) in the case of\ndebt securities issued prior to July 1, 2020,\nnot less than 30 days\u0092 nor more than 60 days\u0092\nprior written notice or (ii) in the case of\ndebt securities issued on or after July 1,\n2020, not less than 15 days\u0092 nor 44\n\nmore than 60 days\u0092 prior written notice, at a\nredemption price equal to 100% of the\nprincipal amount of the debt securities being\nredeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to\nbut excluding the redemption date.

Unless otherwise specified in your\nprospectus supplement, we will initially\nappoint GS&Co. or its successor to act as our\nquotation agent. However, if GS&Co. ceases to\nbe a primary U.S. Government securities dealer\nin New York City, we will appoint another\nprimary U.S. Government securities dealer as\nour quotation agent. The \u0093comparable treasury\nissue\u0094, with respect to any redemption date,\nmeans the United States Treasury security\nselected by the quotation agent as being the\nmost recently issued United States Treasury\nnote or bond as displayed by Bloomberg L.P.\n(or any successor service) on screens PX1\nthrough PX8 (or any other screens as may\nreplace such screens on such service) that has\na remaining term comparable to the remaining\nterm of the debt securities to be redeemed.\nThe \u0093comparable treasury price\u0094, with respect\nto any redemption date, will be (1) the\naverage of five reference treasury dealer\nquotations (as described below) for such\nredemption date, after excluding the highest\nand lowest of such reference treasury dealer\nquotations, or (2) if the quotation agent\nobtains fewer than five such reference\ntreasury dealer quotations, the average of all\nsuch quotations. The \u0093reference treasury\ndealer quotations\u0094, with respect to each\nreference treasury dealer (as described below)\nand any redemption date, means the average, as\ndetermined by the quotation agent, of the bid\nand ask prices for the comparable treasury\nissue, expressed in each case as a percentage\nof its principal amount, quoted in writing to\nthe quotation agent by such reference treasury\ndealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on\nthe third business day preceding such\nredemption date. The \u0093reference treasury\ndealer\u0094 will be (1) the quotation agent or (2)\nany other primary U.S. Government securities\ndealer selected by the quotation agent after\nconsultation with us. If we exercise an option\nto redeem any debt security, we will give to\nthe holder written notice of the principal\namount of the debt security to be redeemed,\nnot less than 30 days nor more than 60 days 45\n\nbefore the applicable redemption date, unless\nyour prospectus supplement provides a\ndifferent notice period. We will give the\nnotice in the manner described below in \u0093\u0097\nNotices\u0094. Street name and other indirect\nowners should contact their banks or brokers\nfor information about how to exercise a\nrepayment right in a timely manner. We or our\naffiliates may purchase debt securities from\ninvestors who are willing to sell from time to\ntime, either in the open market at prevailing\nprices or in private transactions at\nnegotiated prices. Debt securities that we or\nthey purchase may, at our discretion, be held,\nresold or canceled. Mergers and Similar\nTransactions We are generally permitted to\nmerge or consolidate with another corporation\nor other entity. We are also permitted to sell\nour assets substantially as an entirety to\nanother corporation or other entity. With\nregard to any series of debt securities,\nhowever, we may not take any of these actions\nunless all the following conditions are met:\n                                              \n      If the successor entity in the          \n      transaction is not The Goldman Sachs    \n      Group, Inc., the successor entity must  \n      be organized as                         \n      a corporation, partnership or trust     \n      and must expressly assume our           \n      obligations under the debt securities   \n      of that series and the underlying debt  \n      indenture with respect to that series.  \n      The successor entity may be organized   \n      under the laws of any                   \n      jurisdiction, whether in the United     \n      States or elsewhere.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      Immediately after the transaction, no   \n      default under the debt securities of    \n      that series has occurred and is         \n      continuing. For                         \n      this purpose, \u0093default under the debt    \n      securities of that series\u0094 means an      \n      event of default (or, with respect to   \n      any series of securities issued on or   \n      after January\u00a01, 2017 under the 2008    \n      indenture, a covenant breach) with      \n      respect to                              \n      that series or any event that would be  \n      an event of default (or covenant        \n      breach) with respect to that series if  \n      the requirements for giving us default  \n      (or breach) notice and for our default  \n      (or breach) having to continue for a    \n      specific period of time                 \n      were disregarded. We describe these     \n      matters below under \u0093\u0097 Default, Remedies  \n      and Waiver of Default\u0094.                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nIf the conditions described above are\nsatisfied with respect to the debt securities\nof any series, we will not need to obtain the\napproval of the holders of those debt\nsecurities in order to merge or consolidate or\nto sell our assets. Also, these conditions\nwill apply only if we wish to merge or\nconsolidate with another entity or sell our\nassets substantially as an entirety to another\nentity. We will not need to satisfy these\nconditions if we enter into other types of\ntransactions, including any transaction in\nwhich we acquire the stock or assets of\nanother entity, any transaction that involves\na change of control of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. but in which we do not merge or\nconsolidate and any transaction in which we\nsell less than substantially all our assets.\nAlso, if we merge, consolidate or sell our\nassets substantially as an entirety and the\nsuccessor is a non-U.S.entity, neither we nor\nany successor would have any obligation to\ncompensate you for any resulting adverse tax\nconsequences relating to your debt securities.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing and for the\navoidance of doubt, with regard to any\nsecurities of any series issued on or after\nJanuary 1, 2017 under the 2008 indenture or\nany securities of any series issued after July\n7, 2017 under the subordinated debt indenture,\nwe may sell or transfer our assets\nsubstantially as an entirety, in one or more\ntransactions, to one or more entities,\nprovided that the assets of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. and its direct or indirect\nsubsidiaries in which it owns a majority of\nthe combined voting power, taken together, are\nnot sold or transferred substantially as an\nentirety to one or more entities that are not\nsuch subsidiaries. 46\n\nSubordination Provisions Holders of\nsubordinated debt securities should recognize\nthat contractual provisions in the\nsubordinated debt indenture may prohibit us\nfrom making payments on those securities.\nSubordinated debt securities are subordinate\nand junior in right of payment, to the extent\nand in the manner stated in the subordinated\ndebt indenture, to all of our \u0093senior debt\u0094,\nincluding all debt securities we have issued\nand will issue under either of the senior debt\nindentures and all warrants we will issue\nunder the warrant indenture. The ninth\nsupplemental subordinated debt indenture to\nour subordinated debt indenture, which is\napplicable to all of our subordinated debt\nsecurities issued in or after 2015, defines\n\u0093senior debt\u0094 as (i) all indebtedness and\nobligations of, or guaranteed or assumed by,\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. that are for\nborrowed money or evidenced by bonds,\ndebentures, notes or other similar\ninstruments, whether existing now or in the\nfuture, (ii) obligations of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. that are similar to those in\nclause (i) above and arise from off-\nbalancesheet guarantees and direct credit\nsubstitutes, and (iii) all obligations of The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. associated with\nderivative products such as interest rate and\nforeign exchange contracts, commodity\ncontracts and similar arrangements, and, in\neach case, all amendments, renewals,\nextensions, modifications and refundings of\nany indebtedness or obligations of that kind.\nSenior debt excludes the subordinated debt\nsecurities and any other indebtedness or\nobligations specifically designated as being\nsubordinate, or not superior, in right of\npayment to the subordinated debt securities.\nFor purposes of our subordinated debt\nsecurities issued prior to 2015, \u0093senior debt\u0094\nis defined as all indebtedness and obligations\nof, or guaranteed or assumed by, The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. for borrowed money or\nevidenced by bonds, debentures, notes or other\nsimilar instruments, whether existing now or\nin the future, and all amendments, renewals,\nextensions, modifications and refundings of\nany indebtedness or obligations of that kind.\nSenior debt excludes the subordinated debt\nsecurities and any other indebtedness or\nobligations specifically designated as being\nsubordinate, or not superior, in right of\npayment to the subordinated debt securities.\nWe may modify the subordination provisions,\nincluding the definition of senior debt, with\nrespect to one or more series of subordinated\ndebt securities. For a description of these\nmodifications, see the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. The subordinated debt indenture\nprovides that, unless all principal of and any\npremium or interest on the senior debt has\nbeen paid in full, no payment or other\ndistribution may be made in respect of any\nsubordinated debt securities in the following\ncircumstances:\n                                              \n      in the event of any insolvency or       \n      bankruptcy proceedings, or any          \n      receivership, liquidation,              \n      reorganization, assignment for          \n      creditors or other similar proceedings  \n      or events involving us or our assets;   \n                                              \n                                              \n      (a) in the event and during the         \n      continuation of any default in the      \n      payment of principal, premium or        \n      interest on any senior                  \n      debt beyond any applicable grace        \n      period or (b)\u00a0in the event that any     \n      event of default with respect to any    \n      senior debt has occurred and is         \n      continuing, permitting the holders of   \n      that senior debt (or a trustee) to      \n      accelerate the maturity of that         \n      senior debt, whether or not the         \n      maturity is in fact accelerated         \n      (unless, in the case of (a)\u00a0or (b),     \n      the payment default or event of         \n      default has been cured or waived or     \n      ceased to exist and any related         \n      acceleration has been rescinded) or     \n      (c)\u00a0in the event that any judicial      \n      proceeding is pending with respect to   \n      a payment default or event of default   \n      described in (a)\u00a0or (b); or             \n                                              \n                                              \n      in the event that any subordinated      \n      debt securities have been declared due  \n      and payable before their stated         \n      maturity.                               \n                                              \n47\n\nHolders of the subordinated debt securities\nmay be fully subordinated to interests held by\nthe U.S.\ngovernment or other creditors in the event\nthat we enter into a receivership, insolvency,\nliquidation or similar proceeding.\n\nIf the trustee under\nthe subordinated debt indenture or any holders\nof the subordinated debt securities receive\nany payment or distribution that is prohibited\nunder the subordination provisions, then the\ntrustee or the holders will have to repay that\nmoney to the\nholders of the senior debt.\n\nEven if the subordination provisions prevent\nus from making any payment when due on the\nsubordinated debt securities of\nany series we will be in default on our\nobligations under that series if we do not\nmake the payment when due. This means that the\ntrustee under the subordinated debt indenture\nand the holders of that series can take action\nagainst us, but they will\nnot receive any money until the claims of the\nholders of senior debt have been fully\nsatisfied.\n\nThe subordinated debt indenture allows the\nholders\nof senior debt to obtain a court order\nrequiring us and any holder of subordinated\ndebt securities to comply with the\nsubordination provisions.\n\nThe\nsubordinated debt securities also have limited\nacceleration rights. In future subordinated\ndebt securities issuances, unless otherwise\nprovided in your prospectus supplement, there\nwill not be any events of default except in\nthe event of our\nbankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or\nreorganization. Therefore, the maturity of the\nsubordinated debt securities would be\naccelerated only upon our bankruptcy,\nreceivership, insolvency, or reorganization.\nUnless otherwise provided in your\nprospectus supplement, there will be no right\nof acceleration of the payment of principal of\nthe subordinated debt securities upon a\ndefault in the payment of principal, interest\nor any other amount (including upon\nredemption) on the subordinated\ndebt securities or in the performance of any\nof our covenants or agreements contained in\nthe subordinated debt securities or in our\nsubordinated debt indenture. No such payment\nor performance default will result in an event\nof default under the\nsubordinated debt securities or permit any\nholders or the trustee to take action to\nenforce the subordinated debt securities or\nthe subordinated debt indenture, except that a\nholder will be entitled at any time to bring a\nlawsuit for the payment of\nmoney due on the subordinated debt securities\nof such holder.\n\nRestriction on Liens\n\nIn each of the senior debt indentures, we\npromise, with respect to each series of senior\ndebt securities, not to create, assume, incur\nor guarantee any\ndebt for borrowed money that is secured by a\nlien on the voting or profit participating\nequity ownership interests that we or any of\nour subsidiaries own in GS&Co., or in any\nsubsidiary that beneficially owns or holds,\ndirectly or indirectly,\nthose interests in GS&Co., unless we also\nsecure the senior debt securities of that\nseries on an equal or priority basis with the\nother secured debt. Our promise, however, is\nsubject to an important exception: we may\nsecure debt for borrowed\nmoney with liens on those interests without\nsecuring the senior debt securities of any\nseries if our board of directors determines\nthat the liens do not materially detract from\nor interfere with the value or control of\nthose interests, as of the\ndate of the determination.\n\nThe subordinated debt indenture does not\ninclude the promise described in the preceding\nparagraph.\n\nExcept as noted above, none of the indentures\nrestrict our ability to put liens on our\ninterests in our subsidiaries other than\nGS&Co., nor do the\nindentures restrict our ability to sell or\notherwise dispose of our interests in any of\nour subsidiaries, including GS&Co. In\naddition, the restriction on liens in each of\nthe senior debt indentures applies only to\nliens that secure debt for\nborrowed money. For example, liens imposed by\noperation of law, such as liens to secure\nstatutory obligations for taxes or workers\u0092\ncompensation benefits, or liens we create to\nsecure obligations to pay legal judgments or\nsurety bonds, would\nnot be covered by this restriction.\n\n48\n\nDefeasance and Covenant Defeasance Unless we\nsay otherwise in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, the provisions for full defeasance\nand covenant defeasance described below apply\nto each senior debt security, but not to\nsubordinated debt securities. In general, we\nexpect these provisions to apply to each\nsenior debt security that has a specified\ncurrency of U.S. dollars and is not an indexed\ndebt security. Full Defeasance. If there is a\nchange in U.S. federal tax law, as described\nbelow, we can legally release ourselves from\nall payment and other obligations on any\nsenior debt securities. This is called full\ndefeasance. For us to do so, each of the\nfollowing must occur:\n                                              \n      We must deposit in trust for the        \n      benefit of all holders of those senior  \n      debt securities money or a combination  \n      of money and                            \n      U.S. government or U.S. government      \n      agency notes or bonds that will         \n      generate enough cash to make interest,  \n      principal and any other payments on     \n      those senior debt securities on their   \n      various due dates;                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      There must be a change in current U.S.  \n      federal tax law or an Internal Revenue  \n      Service ruling that lets us make the    \n      above                                   \n      deposit without causing the holders to  \n      be taxed on those senior debt           \n      securities any differently than if we   \n      did not make the deposit and just       \n      repaid those senior debt securities     \n      ourselves. Under current federal tax    \n      law, the deposit and our legal          \n      release from your senior debt security  \n      would be treated as though we took      \n      back your senior debt security and      \n      gave you your share of the cash and     \n      notes or bonds deposited in trust. In   \n      that event, you could recognize gain    \n      or loss on your senior debt             \n      security; and                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      We must deliver to the trustee a legal  \n      opinion of our counsel confirming the   \n      tax law change described above.         \n                                              \nIf we ever fully defeased your senior debt\nsecurity, you would have to rely solely on the\ntrust deposit for payments on your senior debt\nsecurity. You would not be able to look to us\nfor payment in the event of any shortfall.\nCovenant Defeasance. Under current U.S.\nfederal tax law, we can make the same type of\ndeposit described above and be released from\nthe restriction on liens described under \u0093\u0097\nRestriction on Liens\u0094 above and any other\nrestrictive covenants relating to your senior\ndebt security that may be described in your\nprospectus supplement. This is called covenant\ndefeasance. In that event, you would lose the\nprotection of those restrictive covenants. In\norder to achieve covenant defeasance for any\nsenior debt securities, we must do both of the\nfollowing:\n                                              \n      We must deposit in trust for the        \n      benefit of the holders of those senior  \n      debt securities money or a combination  \n      of money and                            \n      U.S. government or U.S. government      \n      agency notes or bonds that will         \n      generate enough cash to make interest,  \n      principal and any other payments on     \n      those senior debt securities on their   \n      various due dates; and                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      We must deliver to the trustee a legal  \n      opinion of our counsel confirming that  \n      under current U.S. federal income tax   \n      law we                                  \n      may make the above deposit without      \n      causing the holders to be taxed on      \n      those senior debt securities any        \n      differently than if we did not make     \n      the deposit and just repaid those       \n      senior debt securities ourselves.       \n                                              \nIf we accomplish covenant defeasance with\nregard to your senior debt security, the\nfollowing provisions of the applicable senior\ndebt indenture and your senior debt security\nwould no longer apply:\n                                              \n      Our promise not to create liens on our  \n      voting or profit participating equity   \n      ownership interests in GS&Co.           \n      described                               \n      above under \u0093\u0097 Restriction on Liens\u0094;      \n                                              \n                                              \n      Any additional covenants that your      \n      prospectus supplement may state are     \n      applicable to your senior debt          \n      security; and                           \n                                              \n49\n                                              \n      Any events of default or covenant       \n      breaches resulting from a breach of     \n      the covenants referred to in the two    \n      prior bullets                           \n      (see \u0093\u0097 Default, Remedies and Waiver of   \n      Default \u0097 Events of Default\u0094 and \u0093\u0097         \n      Covenant Breaches\u0094 below).               \n                                              \nAny right we have to redeem will survive\ncovenant defeasance with regard to those\nsenior debt securities. If we accomplish\ncovenant defeasance on your senior debt\nsecurity, you can still look to us for\nrepayment of your senior debt security in the\nevent of any shortfall in the trust deposit.\nYou should note, however, that if one of the\nremaining events of default occurred, such as\nour bankruptcy, and your senior debt security\nbecame immediately due and payable, there may\nbe a shortfall. Depending on the event causing\nthe default, you may not be able to obtain\npayment of the shortfall. Default, Remedies\nand Waiver of Default You will have special\nrights if an event of default or a covenant\nbreach with respect to your debt securities\noccurs and is continuing, as described in this\nsubsection. For securities issued under the\n2008 indenture on or after January 1, 2017,\nand solely for the purposes of this section\nentitled \u0093\u0097 Default, Remedies and Waiver of\nDefault\u0094, the term \u0093series\u0094 refers to debt\nsecurities with the same CUSIP number. Events\nof Default Securities Issued on or After\nJanuary 1, 2017 Under the 2008 Indenture\nUnless your prospectus supplement says\notherwise, when we refer to an event of\ndefault with respect to the debt securities of\nany series issued on or after January 1, 2017\nunder the 2008 indenture, we mean any of the\nfollowing:\n                                              \n      We do not pay the principal or any      \n      premium on any debt security of that    \n      series within 30 days after the due     \n      date;                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n      We do not pay interest on any debt      \n      security of that series within 30 days  \n      after the due date;                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      We file for bankruptcy or other events  \n      of bankruptcy, insolvency or            \n      reorganization relating to The Goldman  \n      Sachs Group,                            \n      Inc. occur. Those events must arise     \n      under U.S. federal or state law,        \n      unless we merge, consolidate or sell    \n      our assets as described above and the   \n      successor firm is a non-U.S. entity.    \n      If that happens, then those             \n      events must arise under U.S. federal    \n      or state law or the law of the          \n      jurisdiction in which the successor     \n      firm is legally organized; or           \n                                              \n                                              \n      If the applicable prospectus            \n      supplement states that any additional   \n      event of default applies to the         \n      series, that event of                   \n      default occurs.                         \n                                              \nFor securities issued under the 2008 indenture\non or after January 1, 2017, no other defaults\nunder or breaches of the 2008 indenture or any\nsecurities will result in an event of default,\nwhether after notice, the passage of time or\notherwise. However, certain events may give\nrise to a covenant breach, as described below\nunder \u0093\u0097 Covenant Breaches\u0094. We may change,\neliminate or add to the events of default with\nrespect to any particular series or any\nparticular debt security or debt securities\nwithin a series, as indicated in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. 50\n\nSecurities Issued Under the 1999 Indenture or\nIssued Before January 1, 2017 Under the 2008\nIndenture Unless your prospectus supplement\nsays otherwise, when we refer to an event of\ndefault with respect to the debt securities of\nany series issued under the 1999 indenture or\nissued before January 1, 2017 under the 2008\nindenture, we mean any of the following:\n                                              \n      We do not pay the principal or any      \n      premium on any debt security of that    \n      series on the due date;                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      We do not pay interest on any debt      \n      security of that series within 30 days  \n      after the due date;                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      We do not deposit a sinking fund        \n      payment with regard to any debt         \n      security of that series on the due      \n      date, but only if the                   \n      payment is required under provisions    \n      described in the applicable prospectus  \n      supplement;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      We remain in breach of our covenant     \n      described above under \u0093\u0097 Restriction on   \n      Liens\u0094 or any other covenant we          \n      make in the debt indenture for the      \n      benefit of that series, for 60 days     \n      after we receive a notice of default    \n      stating that we are in breach and       \n      requiring us to remedy the breach.

We may change, eliminate, or add to\nthe events of default with respect to any\nparticular series or any particular debt\nsecurity or debt securities within a series,\nas indicated in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. 51\n\nCovenant Breaches Unless your prospectus\nsupplement says otherwise, when we refer to a\ncovenant breach with respect to the debt\nsecurities of any series issued on or after\nJanuary 1, 2017 under the 2008 indenture, we\nmean the following:\n                                              \n      We do not deposit a sinking fund        \n      payment with regard to any debt         \n      security of that series on the due      \n      date, but only if the                   \n      payment is required under provisions    \n      described in the applicable prospectus  \n      supplement; or                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      We remain in breach of any covenant we  \n      make in the debt indenture for the      \n      benefit of that series, for 60 days     \n      after we                                \n      receive a notice of covenant breach     \n      stating that we are in breach and       \n      requiring us to remedy the breach. The  \n      notice must be sent by the trustee or   \n      the holders of at least 10% in          \n      principal amount of that series of      \n      debt securities then outstanding.       \n                                              \nWe may change the definition of covenant\nbreach with respect to any particular series\nor any particular debt security or debt\nsecurities within a series, as indicated in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement. A\ncovenant breach shall not be an event of\ndefault with respect to any security. Remedies\nIf an Event of Default or Covenant Breach\nOccurs Except as otherwise specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, if an event\nof default has occurred with respect to any\nseries of debt securities and has not been\ncured or waived, the trustee or the holders of\nnot less than 25% in principal amount of all\ndebt securities of that series then\noutstanding may declare the entire principal\namount of the debt securities of that series\nto be due immediately. Except as otherwise\nspecified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, if the event of default occurs\nbecause of events in bankruptcy, insolvency or\nreorganization relating to The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc., the entire principal amount of\nthe debt securities of that series will be\nautomatically accelerated, without any action\nby the trustee or any holder. Each of the\nsituations described above is called an\nacceleration of the stated maturity of the\naffected series of debt securities. Except as\notherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, if the stated maturity\nof any series is accelerated and a judgment\nfor payment has not yet been obtained, the\nholders of a majority in principal amount of\nthe debt securities of that series may cancel\nthe acceleration for the entire series. For\ndebt securities issued on or after January 1,\n2017 under the 2008 indenture, acceleration\nwill not be permitted for reasons other than a\nspecified payment default or insolvency event\nthat constitutes an event of default in\nrespect of such securities. Neither the\ntrustee nor any holders of such securities\nwill have any enforcement right or other\nremedy in respect of covenant breaches\n(including breaches of the covenant described\nabove under \u0093\u0097 Mergers and Similar\nTransactions\u0094) except as described below. For\nsubordinated debt securities, acceleration\nwill not be permitted for reasons other than a\nspecified insolvency event that constitutes an\nevent of default in respect of such\nsecurities; neither the trustee nor any\nholders of such securities will have any\nenforcement right or other remedy in respect\nof any other defaults under or breach of the\nsubordinated debt indenture or any securities\nexcept as described below. In addition, all\nthe remedies available upon the occurrence of\nan event of default under the subordinated\ndebt indenture will be subject to the\nrestrictions on the subordinated debt\nsecurities described above under \u0093\u0097\nSubordination Provisions\u0094. If an event of\ndefault (or, with respect to securities issued\non or after January 1, 2017 under the 2008\nindenture, a covenant breach) occurs, the\ntrustee will have special duties. In that\nsituation, the 52\n\ntrustee will be obligated to use those of its\nrights and powers under the relevant debt\nindenture, and to use the same degree of care\nand skill in doing so, that a prudent person\nwould use in that situation in conducting his\nor her own affairs. Except as described in the\nprior paragraph, the trustee is not required\nto take any action under the relevant debt\nindenture at the request of any holders unless\nthe holders offer the trustee reasonable\nprotection from expenses and liability. This\nis called an indemnity. If the trustee is\nprovided with an indemnity reasonably\nsatisfactory to it, the holders of a majority\nin principal amount of all debt securities of\nthe relevant series may direct the time,\nmethod and place of conducting any lawsuit or\nother formal legal action seeking any remedy\navailable to the trustee with respect to that\nseries. These majority holders may also direct\nthe trustee in performing any other action\nunder the applicable debt indenture with\nrespect to the debt securities of that series.\nBefore you bypass the trustee and bring your\nown lawsuit or other formal legal action or\ntake other steps to enforce your rights or\nprotect your interests relating to any debt\nsecurity, all of the following must occur:\n                                              \n      The holder of your debt security must   \n      give the trustee written notice that    \n      an event of default (or, with respect   \n      to                                      \n      securities issued on or after January\u00a0  \n      1, 2017 under the 2008 indenture, a     \n      covenant breach) has occurred, and the  \n      event of default (or covenant breach)   \n      must not have been cured or waived;     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n      The holders of not less than 25% in     \n      principal amount of all debt            \n      securities of your series must make a   \n      written request that                    \n      the trustee take action because of the  \n      default (or breach), and they or other  \n      holders must offer to the trustee       \n      indemnity reasonably satisfactory to    \n      the trustee against the cost and other  \n      liabilities of taking that action;      \n                                              \n                                              \n      The trustee must not have taken action  \n      for 60 days after the above steps have  \n      been taken; and                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      During those 60 days, the holders of a  \n      majority in principal amount of the     \n      debt securities of your series must     \n      not have                                \n      given the trustee directions that are   \n      inconsistent with the written request   \n      of the holders of not less than 25% in  \n      principal amount of the debt            \n      securities of your series.              \n                                              \nYou are entitled at any time, however, to\nbring a lawsuit for the payment of money due\non your debt security on or after its stated\nmaturity (or, if your debt security is\nredeemable, on or after its redemption date).\nWaiver of Default The holders of not less than\na majority in principal amount of the debt\nsecurities of any series may waive a default\nfor all debt securities of that series. If\nthis happens, the default will be treated as\nif it has not occurred. No one can waive a\npayment default on your debt security,\nhowever, without the approval of the\nparticular holder of that debt security. For\nthe purpose of this paragraph, the term\n\u0093default\u0094 means any event which is, or after\nnotice or lapse of time or both would become,\nan event of default or covenant breach in\nrespect of the relevant securities. We Will\nGive the Trustee Information About Defaults\nAnnually We will furnish to each trustee every\nyear a written statement of two of our\nofficers certifying that to their knowledge we\nare in compliance with the applicable debt\nindenture and the debt securities issued under\nit, or else specifying any default under the\nrelevant debt indenture. For the purpose of\nthis 53\n\nparagraph, the term \u0093default\u0094 means any event\nwhich is, or after notice or lapse of time or\nboth would become, an event of default or\ncovenant breach in respect of the relevant\nsecurities. Book-entry and other indirect\nowners should consult their banks or brokers\nfor information on how to give notice or\ndirection to or make a request of the trustee\nand how to declare or cancel an acceleration\nof the stated maturity of a series of debt\nsecurities. Book-entry and other indirect\nowners are described below under \u0093Legal\nOwnership and Book-Entry Issuance\u0094.\nModification of the Debt Indentures and Waiver\nof Covenants There are four types of changes\nwe can make to our debt indentures and the\ndebt securities or series of debt securities\nissued under a particular debt indenture.\nChanges Requiring Each Holder\u0092s Approval\nFirst, there are changes that cannot be made\nwithout the approval of the holder of each\ndebt security affected by the change under the\napplicable debt indenture. Here is a list of\nthose types of changes:\n                                              \n      change the stated maturity for any      \n      principal or interest payment on a      \n      debt security;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      reduce the principal amount, the        \n      amount payable on acceleration of the   \n      stated maturity after a default, the    \n      interest rate                           \n      or the redemption price for a debt      \n      security;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      permit redemption of a debt security    \n      if not previously permitted;            \n                                              \n                                              \n      impair any right a holder may have to   \n      require repayment of its debt           \n      security;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      impair any right that a holder of an    \n      indexed or any other debt security may  \n      have to convert the debt security for   \n      or into                                 \n      securities;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      change the currency of any payment on   \n      a debt security;                        \n                                              \n                                              \n      change the place of payment on a debt   \n      security;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      impair a holder\u0092s right to sue for       \n      payment of any amount due on its debt   \n      security;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      reduce the percentage in principal      \n      amount of the debt securities of any    \n      one or more affected series, taken      \n      separately or                           \n      together, as applicable, and whether    \n      comprising the same or different        \n      series or less than all of the debt     \n      securities of a series, the approval    \n      of whose holders is needed to change    \n      the debt indenture or those debt        \n      securities;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      reduce the percentage in principal      \n      amount of the debt securities of any    \n      one or more affected series, taken      \n      separately or                           \n      together, as applicable, and whether    \n      comprising the same or different        \n      series or less than all of the debt     \n      securities of a series, the consent of  \n      whose holders is needed to waive our    \n      compliance with the applicable debt     \n      indenture or to waive defaults;         \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      change the provisions of the            \n      applicable debt indenture dealing with  \n      modification and waiver in any other    \n      respect, except to                      \n      increase any required percentage        \n      referred to above or to add to the      \n      provisions that cannot be changed or    \n      waived without approval of the holder   \n      of each affected debt security.         \n                                              \nChanges Not Requiring Approval The second type\nof change does not require any approval by\nholders of the debt securities affected. These\nchanges are limited to clarifications and\nchanges that would not adversely affect any\ndebt securities of any series in any material\nrespect. Nor do we need any approval to make\nchanges that affect only debt securities to be\nissued under the applicable debt indenture\nafter the changes take effect. 54\n\nWe may also make changes or obtain waivers\nthat do not adversely affect a particular debt\nsecurity, even if they affect other debt\nsecurities. In those cases, we do not need to\nobtain the approval of the holder of the\nunaffected debt security; we need only obtain\nany required approvals from the holders of the\naffected debt securities. Modification of\nSubordination Provisions We may not amend the\nsubordinated debt indenture to alter the\nsubordination of any outstanding subordinated\ndebt securities without the written consent of\neach holder of senior debt then outstanding\nwho would be adversely affected. In addition,\nwe may not modify the subordination provisions\nof the subordinated debt indenture in a manner\nthat would adversely affect the subordinated\ndebt securities of any one or more series then\noutstanding in any material respect, without\nthe consent of the holders of a majority in\naggregate principal amount of all affected\nseries then outstanding, voting together as\none class (and also of any affected series\nthat by its terms is entitled to vote\nseparately as a series as described below).\nChanges Requiring Majority Approval Any other\nchange to the 1999 indenture or the\nsubordinated debt indenture and the debt\nsecurities issued under either such debt\nindenture would require the following\napproval:\n                                              \n      If the change affects only the debt     \n      securities of a particular series it    \n      must be approved by the holders of a    \n      majority in                             \n      principal amount of the debt            \n      securities of that series.              \n                                              \n                                              \n      If the change affects the debt          \n      securities of more than one series of   \n      debt securities issued under the same   \n      debt indenture,                         \n      it must be approved by the holders of   \n      a majority in principal amount of all   \n      such series affected by the change,     \n      with the debt securities of all the     \n      affected series voting together as one  \n      class for this purpose (and of any      \n      affected series that by its             \n      terms is entitled to vote separately    \n      as a class as described below).         \n                                              \nOn the other hand, any other change to the\n2008 indenture and the debt securities issued\nunder that debt indenture would require the\nfollowing approval:\n                                              \n      If the change affects only particular   \n      debt securities within a series, it     \n      must be approved by the holders of a    \n      majority in                             \n      principal amount of such particular     \n      debt securities.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n      If the change affects multiple debt     \n      securities of one or more series, it    \n      must be approved by the holders of a    \n      majority in                             \n      principal amount of all debt            \n      securities affected by the change,      \n      with all such affected debt securities  \n      voting together as one class for this   \n      purpose (and by the holders of a        \n      majority in principal amount of any     \n      affected debt securities that by their  \n      terms are entitled to vote separately   \n      as described below).                    \n                                              \nIn each case, the required approval must be\ngiven by written consent. This would mean that\nmodification of terms with respect to certain\nsecurities of a series issued under the 2008\nindenture could be effectuated without\nobtaining the consent of the holders of a\nmajority in principal amount of other\nsecurities of such series that are not\naffected by such modification. The same\nmajority approval would be required for us to\nobtain a waiver of any of our covenants in any\ndebt indenture. Our covenants include the\npromises we make about merging and putting\nliens on our interests in GS&Co., which we\ndescribe above under \u0093\u0097 Mergers and Similar\nTransactions\u0094 and \u0093\u0097 Restriction on Liens\u0094,\nand which, in the latter case, are only for\nthe benefit of the holders of our senior debt\nsecurities. If the holders approve a waiver of\na covenant, we will not have to comply with\nit. The holders, however, cannot approve a\nwaiver of any provision in a particular debt\nsecurity, or in the 55\n\napplicable debt indenture as it affects that\ndebt security, that we cannot change without\nthe approval of the holder of that debt\nsecurity as described above in \u0093\u0097 Changes\nRequiring Each Holder\u0092s Approval\u0094, unless that\nholder approves the waiver. Book-entry and\nother indirect owners should consult their\nbanks or brokers for information on how\napproval may be granted or denied if we seek\nto change a debt indenture or any debt\nsecurities or request a waiver. Special Rules\nfor Action by Holders When holders take any\naction under any of our debt indentures, such\nas giving a notice of default, notice of\ncovenant breach, declaring an acceleration,\napproving any change or waiver or giving the\ntrustee an instruction, we will apply the\nfollowing rules. Only Outstanding Debt\nSecurities Are Eligible Only holders of\noutstanding debt securities or the outstanding\ndebt securities of the applicable series, as\napplicable, will be eligible to participate in\nany action by holders of such debt securities\nor the debt securities of that series. Also,\nwe will count only outstanding debt securities\nin determining whether the various percentage\nrequirements for taking action have been met.\nFor these purposes, a debt security will not\nbe \u0093outstanding\u0094 if:\n                                              \n      it has been surrendered for             \n      cancellation;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      we have deposited or set aside, in      \n      trust for its holder, money for its     \n      payment or redemption;                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      we have fully defeased it as described  \n      above under \u0093\u0097 Defeasance and Covenant    \n      Defeasance \u0097 Full                        \n      Defeasance\u0094; or                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      we or one of our affiliates, such as    \n      GS&Co., is the owner.                   \n                                              \nSpecial Class Voting Rights We may issue\nparticular debt securities or a particular\nseries of debt securities, as applicable, that\nare entitled, by their terms, to vote\nseparately on matters (for example,\nmodification or waiver of provisions in the\napplicable debt indenture) that would\notherwise require a vote of all affected debt\nsecurities or all affected series voting\ntogether as a single class. Any such debt\nsecurities or series of debt securities would\nbe entitled to vote together with all other\naffected debt securities or affected series\nvoting together as one class, and would also\nbe entitled to vote separately as a class\nonly. In some cases, other parties may be\nentitled to exercise these special voting\nrights on behalf of the holders of the\nrelevant debt securities or the relevant\nseries. For debt securities or series of debt\nsecurities that have these rights, the rights\nwill be described in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. For debt securities or series of\ndebt securities that do not have these special\nrights, voting will occur as described in the\npreceding section, but subject to any separate\nvoting rights of any other debt securities or\nseries of debt securities having special\nrights. We may issue series having these or\nother special voting rights without obtaining\nthe consent of or giving notice to holders of\noutstanding debt securities or series.\nEligible Principal Amount of Some Debt\nSecurities In some situations, we may follow\nspecial rules in calculating the principal\namount of debt securities that are to be\ntreated as outstanding for the purposes\ndescribed above. This may happen, for example,\nif the principal amount is payable in a\nnon-U.S.dollar currency, increases over time\nor is not to be fixed until maturity. 56\n\nFor any debt security of the kind described\nbelow, we will decide how much principal\namount to attribute to the debt security as\nfollows:\n                                              \n      For an original issue discount debt     \n      security, we will use the principal     \n      amount that would be due and payable    \n      on the action                           \n      date if the maturity of the debt        \n      security were accelerated to that date  \n      because of a default;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n      For a debt security whose principal     \n      amount is not known, we will use any    \n      amount that we indicate in the          \n      prospectus                              \n      supplement for that debt security. The  \n      principal amount of a debt security     \n      may not be known, for example, because  \n      it is based on an index that changes    \n      from time to time and the principal     \n      amount is not to be determined until a  \n      later date; or                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      For debt securities with a principal    \n      amount denominated in one or more       \n      non-U.S.                                \n      dollar currencies or currency units,    \n      we will use the U.S. dollar             \n      equivalent, which we will determine.    \n                                              \nDetermining Record Dates for Action by Holders\nWe will generally be entitled to set any day\nas a record date for the purpose of\ndetermining the holders that are entitled to\ntake action under a particular debt indenture.\nIn certain limited circumstances, only the\ntrustee will be entitled to set a record date\nfor action by holders. If we or the trustee\nset a record date for an approval or other\naction to be taken by holders, that vote or\naction may be taken only by persons or\nentities who are holders on the record date\nand must be taken during the period that we\nspecify for this purpose, or that the trustee\nspecifies if it sets the record date. We or\nthe trustee, as applicable, may shorten or\nlengthen this period from time to time. This\nperiod, however, may not extend beyond the\n180th day after the record date for the\naction. In addition, record dates for any\nglobal debt security may be set in accordance\nwith procedures established by the depositary\nfrom time to time. Accordingly, record dates\nfor global debt securities may differ from\nthose for other debt securities. Form,\nExchange and Transfer of Debt Securities If\nany debt securities cease to be issued in\nregistered global form, they will be issued:\n                                      \n      only in fully registered form;  \n                                      \n                                     \n      without interest coupons; and  \n                                     \n                                              \n      unless we indicate otherwise in your    \n      prospectus supplement, in               \n      denominations of $1,000 and integral    \n      multiples of $1,000 in                  \n      excess thereof.                         \n                                              \nHolders may exchange their debt securities for\ndebt securities of smaller denominations or\ncombined into fewer debt securities of larger\ndenominations, as long as the total principal\namount is not changed. You may not exchange\nyour debt securities for securities of a\ndifferent series or having different terms,\nunless your prospectus supplement says you\nmay. Holders may exchange or transfer their\ndebt securities at the office of the trustee.\nThey may also replace lost, stolen, destroyed\nor mutilated debt securities at that office.\nWe have appointed the trustee to act as our\nagent for registering debt securities in the\nnames of holders and transferring and\nreplacing debt securities. We may appoint\nanother entity to perform these functions or\nperform them ourselves. Holders will not be\nrequired to pay a service charge to transfer\nor exchange their debt securities, but they\nmay be required to pay for any tax or other\ngovernmental charge associated with the\nexchange or transfer. The transfer or\nexchange, and any replacement, will be made\nonly if our transfer agent is satisfied with\nthe holder\u0092s proof of legal ownership. The\ntransfer agent may require an indemnity before\nreplacing any debt securities. 57\n\nIf we have designated additional transfer\nagents for your debt security, they will be\nnamed in your prospectus supplement. We may\nappoint additional transfer agents or cancel\nthe appointment of any particular transfer\nagent. We may also approve a change in the\noffice through which any transfer agent acts.\nIf the debt securities of any series are\nredeemable and we redeem less than all those\ndebt securities, we may block the transfer or\nexchange of those debt securities during the\nperiod beginning 15 calendar days before the\nday we mail the notice of redemption and\nending on the day of that mailing, in order to\nfreeze the list of holders to prepare the\nmailing. We may also refuse to register\ntransfers of or exchange any debt security\nselected for redemption, except that we will\ncontinue to permit transfers and exchanges of\nthe unredeemed portion of any debt security\nbeing partially redeemed. If a debt security\nis issued as a global debt security, only the\ndepositary \u0097 e.g., DTC, Euroclear or\nClearstream \u0097 will be entitled to transfer and\nexchange the debt security as described in\nthis subsection, since the depositary will be\nthe sole holder of the debt security. The\nrules for exchange described above apply to\nexchange of debt securities for other debt\nsecurities of the same series and kind. If a\ndebt security is convertible, exercisable or\nexchangeable into or for a different kind of\nsecurity, such as one that we have not issued,\nor for other property, the rules governing\nthat type of conversion, exercise or exchange\nwill be described in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. Payment of Additional Amounts We\nintend to make all payments on the debt\nsecurities without deducting U.S. withholding\ntaxes unless the law requires us to deduct\nwithholding taxes. The remainder of this\nsubsection does not apply unless the relevant\nprospectus supplement specifies that this\nsubsection entitled \u0093\u0097 Payment of Additional\nAmounts\u0094 is applicable to your debt\nsecurities. If we are required by law to\ndeduct U.S. withholding taxes on payments to\nnon-U.S.investors and if so specified in your\nprospectus supplement, we will pay additional\namounts on those payments to the extent\ndescribed in this subsection. We will pay\nadditional amounts on a debt security only if\nthe beneficial owner of the debt security is a\nUnited States alien. The term \u0093United States\nalien\u0094 means any person who, for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, is:\n                                       \n      a nonresident alien individual;  \n                                       \n                              \n      a foreign corporation;  \n                              \n                                              \n      a foreign partnership one or more of    \n      the members of which is, for U.S.       \n      federal income tax purposes, a foreign  \n      corporation,                            \n      a nonresident alien individual or a     \n      nonresident alien fiduciary of a        \n      foreign estate or trust; or             \n                                              \n                                              \n      a nonresident alien fiduciary of an     \n      estate or trust that is not subject to  \n      U.S. federal income tax on a net        \n      income basis on                         \n      income or gain from a debt security.    \n                                              \nIf the beneficial owner of a debt security is\na United States alien, we will pay all\nadditional amounts that may be necessary so\nthat every net payment of interest or\nprincipal on that debt security will not be\nless than the amount provided for in that debt\nsecurity. By net payment, we mean the amount\nwe or our paying agent pays after deducting or\nwithholding an amount for or on account of any\npresent or future tax, assessment or other\ngovernmental charge imposed with respect to\nthat payment by a U.S. taxing authority. 58\n\nOur obligation to pay additional amounts is\nsubject to several important exceptions,\nhowever. We will notpay additional amounts for\nor on account of any of the following:\n                                              \n      any tax, assessment or other            \n      governmental charge imposed solely      \n      because at any time there is or was a   \n      connection between                      \n      the beneficial owner \u0097 or between a      \n      fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,        \n      shareholder or member of the            \n      beneficial owner, if the beneficial     \n      owner is an estate, trust, partnership  \n      or corporation \u0097 and the United States   \n      (other than the mere                    \n      receipt of a payment or the ownership   \n      or holding of a debt security),         \n      including because the beneficial owner  \n      \u0097 or the fiduciary, settlor,             \n      beneficiary, shareholder or member \u0097 at  \n      any time, for U.S. federal income tax   \n      purposes:                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      is or was a citizen or resident or is   \n      or was treated as a resident of the     \n      United States;

When we\nrefer to the \u0093United States\u0094, we mean the\nUnited States of America, including the states\nand the District of Columbia, together with\nthe\nterritories, possessions and all those areas\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United\nStates of America.\n\nWhen we refer to any payment of interest\nor principal on a debt security in this\nsubsection, this includes any additional\namount that may be payable as described above\nin respect of that payment.\n\nPayment Mechanics for Debt Securities\n\nWho Receives Payment?\n\nIf interest is due on a debt security on an\ninterest payment date, we will pay the\ninterest to the person in whose name the debt\nsecurity is registered at the close of\nbusiness on the regular record date relating\nto the interest payment date as described\nbelow under \u0093\u0097 Payment and Record Dates for\nInterest\u0094. If interest is due at maturity but\non a day that is\nnot an interest payment date, we will pay the\ninterest to the person entitled to receive the\nprincipal of the debt security. If principal\nor another amount besides interest is due on a\ndebt security at maturity, we will pay the\namount to the holder\nof the debt security against surrender of the\ndebt security at a proper place of payment or,\nin the case of a global debt security, in\naccordance with the applicable policies of the\ndepositary, DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as\napplicable.\n\nPayment and Record Dates for Interest\n\nThe dates on\nwhich interest will be payable will be\nspecified in your prospectus supplement.\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, the regular record date\nrelating to an interest payment date for any\nfixed rate debt security or\nfloating rate debt security will be the 15th\ncalendar day before that interest payment\ndate. These record dates will apply regardless\nof whether a particular record date is a\n\u0093business day\u0094, as defined below. For the\npurpose of determining\nthe holder at the close of business on a\nregular record date when business is not being\nconducted, the close of business will mean\n5:00 P.M., New York City time, on that day.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, and unless\nspecified otherwise in your prospectus\nsupplement, the regular record date relating\nto an interest payment\ndate for any debt security in book-entry or\nglobal form will be the day immediately prior\nto the day on which the interest payment is to\nbe made (as such payment day may be adjusted\nunder the applicable business day convention).\nThis prior day will\nbe the record date whether or not it is a\nbusiness day.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in this prospectus\nor in the applicable prospectus supplement,\nthe term \u0093days\u0094 refers to calendar days.\n\n60\n\nHow We Will Make Payments Due in U.S. Dollars\n\nWe will follow the practice described in this\nsubsection when paying amounts due in U.S.\ndollars. Payments of amounts due in other\ncurrencies will be\nmade as described in the next subsection.\n\nPayments on Global Debt Securities. We will\nmake payments on a global debt security in\naccordance with the applicable policies of the\ndepositary as in effect from time to time.\nUnder those policies, we will pay directly to\nthe depositary, or its nominee, and not to any\nindirect owners who own beneficial interests\nin the global debt\nsecurity. An indirect owner\u0092s right to receive\nthose payments will be governed by the rules\nand practices of the depositary and its\nparticipants, as described below in the\nsection entitled \u0093Legal Ownership and Book-\nEntry Issuance \u0097\nWhat Is a Global Security?\u0094.\n\nPayments on Non-GlobalDebt Securities. We will\nmake\npayments on a debt security in non-global,\nregistered form as follows. We will pay\ninterest that is due on an interest payment\ndate by check mailed on the interest payment\ndate to the holder at his or her\naddress shown on the trustee\u0092s records as of\nthe close of business on the relevant regular\nrecord date. We will make all other payments\nby check or via wire transfer at the paying\nagent described below, against surrender of\nthe debt security.\nAll payments by check will be made in next-day\nfunds \u0097 i.e., funds that become available on\nthe day after the check is cashed or wire\ntransfer is completed.\n\nAlternatively, if a non-global debt security\nhas a principal amount of at least $1,000,000\n(or the equivalent in\nanother currency) and the holder asks us to do\nso, we will pay any amount that becomes due on\nthe debt security by wire transfer of\nimmediately available funds to an account at a\nbank in New York City, on the due date. To\nrequest wire payment, the\nholder must give the paying agent appropriate\nwire transfer instructions at least five\nbusiness days before the requested wire\npayment is due. In the case of any interest\npayment due on an interest payment date, the\ninstructions must be given by the\nperson or entity who is the holder on the\nrelevant regular record date. In the case of\nany other payment, payment will be made only\nafter the debt security is surrendered to the\npaying agent. Any wire instructions, once\nproperly given, will remain\nin effect unless and until new instructions\nare given in the manner described above.\n\nBook-entry and other indirect owners should\nconsult their banks or brokers for information\non how they will receive payments on their\ndebt securities.\n\nHow We Will Make Payments Due in Other\nCurrencies\n\nWe will follow the practice described in this\nsubsection when paying amounts that are due in\na specified currency other than U.S. dollars.\n\nPayments on Global Debt Securities. We will\nmake payments on a global debt security in the\napplicable specified currency in accordance\nwith the applicable policies as in effect from\ntime to time of the depositary, which will be\nDTC, Euroclear or Clearstream. Unless we\nspecify otherwise in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, The Depository Trust Company, New\nYork, New York, known\nas DTC, will be the depositary for all debt\nsecurities in global form.\n\nIndirect owners of a global debt security\ndenominated in a currency other than U.S.\ndollars should consult their banks or brokers\nfor information on how to request payment in\nthe specified currency in cases where holders\nhave a right to do so.\n\nPayments on Non-GlobalDebt Securities. Except\nas described in the last paragraph under this\nheading, we will make payments on debt\nsecurities in non-global form in the\napplicable specified\n\n61\n\ncurrency. We will make these payments by wire\ntransfer of immediately available funds to any\naccount that is maintained in the applicable\nspecified currency at a bank designated by the\nholder and\nis acceptable to us and the trustee. To\ndesignate an account for wire payment, the\nholder must give the paying agent appropriate\nwire instructions at least five business days\nbefore the requested wire payment is due. In\nthe case of any interest\npayment due on an interest payment date, the\ninstructions must be given by the person or\nentity who is the holder on the relevant\nregular record date. In the case of any other\npayment, the payment will be made only after\nthe debt security is\nsurrendered to the paying agent. Any\ninstructions, once properly given, will remain\nin effect unless and until new instructions\nare properly given in the manner described\nabove.\n\nIf a holder fails to give instructions as\ndescribed above, we will notify the holder at\nthe address in the trustee\u0092s records and will\nmake the\npayment within five business days after the\nholder provides appropriate instructions. Any\nlate payment made in these circumstances will\nbe treated under the applicable debt indenture\nas if made on the due date, and no interest\nwill accrue on the\nlate payment from the due date to the date\npaid.\n\nAlthough a payment on a debt security in non-\nglobal form\nmay be due in a specified currency other than\nU.S. dollars, we will make the payment in U.S.\ndollars if your prospectus supplement\nspecifies that holders may ask us to do so and\nyou make such a request. To request U.S.\ndollar payment in these\ncircumstances, the holder must provide\nappropriate written notice to the trustee at\nleast five business days before the next due\ndate for which payment in U.S. dollars is\nrequested. In the case of any interest payment\ndue on an interest payment\ndate, the request must be made by the person\nor entity who is the holder on the relevant\nregular record date. Any request, once\nproperly made, will remain in effect unless\nand until revoked by notice properly given in\nthe manner described above.\n\nBook-entry and other indirect owners of a debt\nsecurity with a specified currency other than\nU.S. dollars should contact their banks or\nbrokers for information about how to receive\npayments in the specified currency or in U.S.\ndollars.\n\nConversion to U.S. Dollars. Unless otherwise\nindicated in your prospectus supplement,\nholders are not entitled to receive payments\nin U.S.\ndollars of an amount due in another currency,\neither on a global debt security or a non-\nglobal debt security.\n\nIf your prospectus supplement specifies that\nholders may request that we make payments in\nU.S. dollars of an amount due in another\ncurrency, the\nexchange rate agent described below will\ncalculate the U.S. dollar amount the holder\nreceives in the exchange rate agent\u0092s\ndiscretion. A holder that requests payment in\nU.S. dollars will bear all associated foreign\ncurrency exchange costs,\nwhich will be deducted from the payment.\n\nWhen the Specified Currency Is Not Available.\nIf we are obligated to make any payment in a\nspecified currency other than U.S. dollars,\nand the specified currency or any successor\ncurrency is not available to us due to\ncircumstances beyond our control \u0097 such as the\nimposition of exchange controls or a\ndisruption in the currency\nmarkets \u0097 we will be entitled to satisfy our\nobligation to make the payment in that\nspecified currency by making the payment in\nU.S. dollars, on the basis of the exchange\nrate determined by the exchange rate agent\ndescribed below, in its\ndiscretion.\n\nThe foregoing will apply to any debt security,\nwhether in global or non-global form, and to\nany\npayment, including a payment at maturity. Any\npayment made under the circumstances and in a\nmanner described above will not result in a\ndefault under any debt security or the\napplicable debt indenture.\n\n62\n\nExchange Rate Agent. If we issue a debt\nsecurity in a specified currency other than\nU.S.\ndollars, we will appoint a financial\ninstitution to act as the exchange rate agent\nand will name the institution initially\nappointed when the debt security is originally\nissued in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. We may select GS&Co. or\nanother of our affiliates to perform this\nrole. We may change the exchange rate agent\nfrom time to time after the original issue\ndate of the debt security without your consent\nand without notifying you of the change.\n\nAll determinations made by the exchange rate\nagent will be in its sole discretion unless we\nstate in the applicable prospectus supplement\nthat any\ndetermination requires our approval. In the\nabsence of manifest error, those\ndeterminations will be conclusive for all\npurposes and binding on you and us, without\nany liability on the part of the exchange rate\nagent.\n\nPayment When Offices Are Closed\n\nUnless specified\notherwise in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, if any payment is due on a debt\nsecurity on a day that is not a business day,\nwe will make the payment on the next business\nday. Payments postponed to the next business\nday in this situation will be\ntreated under the applicable debt indenture as\nif they were made on the original due date.\nPostponement of this kind will not result in a\ndefault under any debt security or the\napplicable debt indenture, and, unless\notherwise specified on the\napplicable prospectus supplement, no interest\nwill accrue on the postponed amount from the\noriginal due date to the next business day.\nThe term business day has a special meaning,\nwhich we describe above under \u0093\u0097 Payment and\nRecord Dates\nfor Interest\u0094.\n\nPaying Agent\n\nWe may appoint\none or more financial institutions to act as\nour paying agents, at whose designated offices\ndebt securities in non-global entry form may\nbe surrendered for payment at their maturity.\nWe call each of those\noffices a paying agent. We may add, replace or\nterminate paying agents from time to time. We\nmay also choose to act as our own paying\nagent. Initially, we have appointed the\ntrustee, at its corporate trust office in New\nYork City, as the paying\nagent. We must notify the trustee of changes\nin the paying agents.\n\nUnclaimed Payments\n\nRegardless of who acts as paying agent, all\nmoney paid by us to a paying agent that\nremains unclaimed at the end of two years\nafter the amount is due to\na holder will be repaid to us. After that two-\nyear period, the holder may look only to us\nfor payment and not to the trustee, any other\npaying agent or anyone else.\n\nNotices\n\nNotices to be given to holders of a\nglobal debt security will be given only to the\ndepositary, in accordance with its applicable\npolicies as in effect from time to time.\nNotices to be given to holders of debt\nsecurities not in global form will be sent by\nmail to the respective\naddresses of the holders as they appear in the\ntrustee\u0092s records, and will be deemed given\nwhen mailed. Neither the failure to give any\nnotice to a particular holder, nor any defect\nin a notice given to a particular holder, will\naffect the\nsufficiency of any notice given to another\nholder.\n\nBook-entry and other indirect owners should\nconsult their banks or brokers for information\non how they will receive notices.\n\n63\n\nOur Relationship With the Trustee\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon has provided\ncommercial banking and other services for us\nand our affiliates in the past and may do so\nin the future. Among\nother things, The Bank of New York Mellon\nprovides us with a line of credit, holds debt\nsecurities issued by us and serves as trustee\nor agent with regard to other debt obligations\nand warrants of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nor its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon is initially\nserving as the trustee for the senior debt\nsecurities and subordinated debt securities\nand the warrants\nissued under our warrant indenture.\nConsequently, if an actual or potential event\nof default or covenant breach occurs with\nrespect to any of these securities, the\ntrustee may be considered to have a\nconflicting interest for purposes of the Trust\nIndenture Act of 1939. In that case, the\ntrustee may be required to resign under one or\nmore of the indentures, and we would be\nrequired to appoint a successor trustee. For\nthis purpose, a \u0093potential\u0094 event of default\nor covenant breach\nmeans an event that would be an event of\ndefault or covenant breach if the requirements\nfor giving us default notice or for the\ndefault having to exist for a specific period\nof time were disregarded.\n\nIn addition, affiliates of the trustee have\nunderwritten our securities from time to time\nin the past and may underwrite our securities\nfrom time to\ntime in the future. The trustee may have to\nresign if a default occurs with respect to the\ndebt securities within one year after any\noffering of our securities underwritten by an\naffiliate of the trustee, such as BNY Mellon\nCapital Markets, LLC,\nsince the trustee would likely be considered\nto have a conflicting interest for purposes of\nthe Trust Indenture Act of 1939. In that\nevent, except in very limited circumstances,\nthe trustee would be required to resign as\ntrustee under one or more of\nthe indentures and we would be required to\nappoint a successor trustee, unless the\ndefault is cured or waived within 90 days. In\naddition, the trustee can resign for any\nreason with 60 days notice, and we would be\nrequired to appoint a successor\ntrustee. If the trustee resigns following a\ndefault or for any other reason, it may be\ndifficult to identify and appoint a qualified\nsuccessor trustee. The trustee will remain the\ntrustee under the indenture until a successor\nis appointed. During\nthe period of time until a successor is\nappointed, the trustee will have both (a)\nduties to noteholders under the indenture and\n(b) a conflicting interest under the indenture\nfor purposes of the Trust Indenture Act.\n\nUnder the indentures, we are required to file\nwith the trustee any information, documents\nand other reports, or summaries thereof, as\nmay be required\nunder the Trust Indenture Act, at the times\nand in the manner provided under the Trust\nIndenture Act. However, in case of documents\nfiled with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or\n15(d) of the Exchange Act, any such filing\nwith the trustee need\nnot be made until the 15th day after such\nfiling is actually made with the SEC.\n\n64\n\nDESCRIPTION OF WARRANTS WE MAY OFFER Please\nnote that in this section entitled\n\u0093Description of Warrants We May Offer\u0094,\nreferences to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.,\n\u0093we\u0094, \u0093our\u0094 and \u0093us\u0094 refer only to The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. and not to its consolidated\nsubsidiaries.

Warrants of this kind will not be\nsecured by any property or assets of The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. or its subsidiaries.\nThus, by owning a warrant issued under the\nindenture, you hold one of our unsecured\nobligations. The warrants issued under the\nindenture will be contractual obligations of\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and will rank\nequally with all of our other unsecured\ncontractual obligations and unsecured and\nunsubordinated debt. The indenture does not\nlimit our ability to incur additional\ncontractual obligations or debt. The indenture\nis a contract between us and The Bank of New\nYork Mellon, which will initially act as\ntrustee. The trustee has two main roles:\n                                              \n      First, the trustee can enforce your     \n      rights against us if we default. There  \n      are some limitations on the extent to   \n      which the                               \n      trustee acts on your behalf, which we   \n      describe below under \u0093\u0097 Default,          \n      Remedies and Waiver of Default\u0094.         \n                                              \n                                              \n      Second, the trustee performs            \n      administrative duties for us, such as   \n      sending you payments and notices.       \n                                              \nSee \u0093\u0097 Our Relationship With the Trustee\u0094\nbelow for more information about the trustee.\nWe May Issue Many Series of Warrants Under the\nIndenture We do not have any restrictions on\nthe number of distinct series of warrants that\nwe may issue under the warrant indenture. This\nsection summarizes terms of the warrants that\napply generally to all series. The provisions\nof the indenture allow us not only to issue\nwarrants with terms different from those of\nwarrants previously issued under the\nindenture, but also to \u0093reopen\u0094 a previously\nissued series of warrants and issue additional\nwarrants of that series. Amounts That We May\nIssue The warrant indenture does not limit the\naggregate number of warrants that we may issue\nor the number of series or the aggregate\namount of any particular series. We may issue\nwarrants and other securities at any time\nwithout your consent and without notifying\nyou. The indenture and the warrants do not\nlimit our ability to incur other contractual\nobligations or indebtedness or to issue other\nsecurities. Also, the terms of the warrants do\nnot impose financial or similar restrictions\non us except as described below under \u0093\u0097\nRestriction on Liens\u0094. Expiration Date and\nPayment or Settlement Date The term\n\u0093expiration date\u0094 with respect to any warrant\nmeans the date on which the right to exercise\nthe warrant expires. The term \u0093payment or\nsettlement date\u0094 with respect to any warrant\nmeans the date when any money or warrant\nproperty with respect to that warrant becomes\npayable or deliverable upon exercise or\nredemption of that warrant in accordance with\nits terms. This Section Is Only a Summary The\nwarrant indenture and its associated\ndocuments, including your warrant, contain the\nfull legal text of the matters described in\nthis section and your prospectus supplement.\nWe have filed a copy of the indenture with the\nSEC as an exhibit to our registration\nstatement. See \u0093Available Information\u0094 above\nfor information on how to obtain a copy of it.\n68\n\nThis section and your prospectus supplement\nsummarize all the material terms of the\nindenture and your warrant. They do not,\nhowever, describe every aspect of the\nindenture and your warrant. For example, in\nthis section and your prospectus supplement,\nwe use terms that have been given special\nmeaning in the indenture, but we describe the\nmeaning for only the more important of those\nterms. Governing Law The warrant indenture and\nthe warrants will be governed by New York law.\nCurrency of Warrants Amounts that become due\nand payable on your warrant may be payable in\na currency, composite currency, basket of\ncurrencies or currency unit or units specified\nin your prospectus supplement. We refer to\nthis currency, composite currency, basket of\ncurrencies or currency unit or units as a\n\u0093specified currency\u0094. The specified currency\nfor your warrant will be U.S. dollars, unless\nyour prospectus supplement states otherwise.\nYou will have to pay for your warrant by\ndelivering the requisite amount of the\nspecified currency to GS&Co. or another firm\nthat we name in your prospectus supplement,\nunless other arrangements have been made\nbetween you and us or you and that firm. We\nwill make payments on your warrants in the\nspecified currency, except as described below\nin \u0093\u0097 Payment Mechanics for Warrants\u0094. See\n\u0093Considerations Relating to Securities\nDenominated or Payable in or Linked to a\nNon-U.S.Dollar Currency\u0094 below for more\ninformation about risks of investing in\nwarrants of this kind. Mergers and Similar\nTransactions We are generally permitted to\nmerge or consolidate with another corporation\nor other entity. We are also permitted to sell\nour assets substantially as an entirety to\nanother corporation or other entity. With\nregard to any warrant, however, we may not\ntake any of these actions unless all the\nfollowing conditions are met:\n                                              \n      If the successor entity in the          \n      transaction is not The Goldman Sachs    \n      Group, Inc., the successor entity must  \n      be organized as                         \n      a corporation, partnership or trust     \n      and must expressly assume our           \n      obligations under that warrant and the  \n      indenture. The successor entity may be  \n      organized under the laws of any         \n      jurisdiction, whether in the United     \n      States or elsewhere.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      Immediately after the transaction, no   \n      default under the warrant has occurred  \n      and is continuing. For this purpose,    \n      \u0093default under the warrant\u0094 means an      \n      event of default with respect to that   \n      warrant or any event that would be an   \n      event of default with respect to that   \n      warrant if the requirements for giving  \n      us default notice and for our default   \n      having to                               \n      continue for a specific period of time  \n      were disregarded. We describe these     \n      matters below under \u0093\u0097 Default, Remedies  \n      and Waiver of Default\u0094.                  \n                                              \nIf the conditions described above are\nsatisfied with respect to any warrant, we will\nnot need to obtain the approval of the holder\nof that warrant in order to merge or\nconsolidate or to sell our assets. Also, these\nconditions will apply only if we wish to merge\nor consolidate with another entity or sell our\nassets substantially as an entirety to another\nentity. We will not need to satisfy these\nconditions if we enter into other types of\ntransactions, including any transaction in\nwhich we acquire the stock or assets of\nanother entity, any transaction that involves\na change of control of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. but in which we do not merge or\nconsolidate and any transaction in which we\nsell less than substantially all our assets.\nAlso, if we merge, consolidate or sell our\nassets substantially as an entirety and the\nsuccessor is a non-U.S.entity, neither we nor\nany successor would have any obligation to\ncompensate you for any resulting adverse tax\nconsequences relating to your warrants. 69\n\nRestriction on Liens In the warrant indenture,\nwe promise, with respect to each series of\nwarrants, not to create or guarantee any debt\nfor borrowed money that is secured by a lien\non the voting or profit participating equity\nownership interests that we or any of our\nsubsidiaries own in GS&Co., or in any\nsubsidiary that beneficially owns or holds,\ndirectly or indirectly, those interests in\nGS&Co., unless we also secure the warrants of\nthat series on an equal or priority basis with\nthe secured debt. Our promise, however, is\nsubject to an important exception: we may\nsecure debt for borrowed money with liens on\nthose interests without securing the warrants\nof any series if our board of directors\ndetermines that the liens do not materially\ndetract from or interfere with the value or\ncontrol of those interests as of the date of\nthe determination. Except as noted above, the\nindenture does not restrict our ability to put\nliens on our interests in our subsidiaries\nother than GS&Co., nor does the indenture\nrestrict our ability to sell or otherwise\ndispose of our interests in any of our\nsubsidiaries, including GS&Co. In addition,\nthe restriction on liens in the indenture\napplies only to liens that secure debt for\nborrowed money. For example, liens imposed by\noperation of law, such as liens to secure\nstatutory obligations for taxes or workers\u0092\ncompensation benefits, or liens we create to\nsecure obligations to pay legal judgments or\nsurety bonds, would not be covered by this\nrestriction. Default, Remedies and Waiver of\nDefault You will have special rights if an\nevent of default with respect to your warrant\noccurs and is continuing, as described in this\nsubsection. Events of Default.Unless your\nprospectus supplement says otherwise, when we\nrefer to an event of default with respect to\nany warrant, we mean that, upon satisfaction\nby the holder of the warrant of all conditions\nprecedent to our relevant obligation or\ncovenant to be satisfied by the holder, any of\nthe following occurs:\n                                              \n      We do not pay any money or deliver any  \n      warrant property with respect to that   \n      warrant on the payment or settlement    \n      date in                                 \n      accordance with the terms of that       \n      warrant;                                \n                                              \n                                              \n      We remain in breach of our covenant     \n      described above under \u0093\u0097 Restriction on   \n      Liens\u0094, or any other covenant we         \n      make in the indenture for the benefit   \n      of the holder of that warrant for 60    \n      days after we receive a notice of       \n      default stating that we are in breach   \n      and requiring us to remedy the breach.  \n      The notice must be sent by the trustee  \n      or the holders of at                    \n      least 10% in number of the relevant     \n      series of warrants;                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      We file for bankruptcy or other events  \n      of bankruptcy, insolvency or            \n      reorganization relating to The Goldman  \n      Sachs Group,                            \n      Inc. occur. Those events must arise     \n      under U.S. federal or state law,        \n      unless we merge, consolidate or sell    \n      our assets as described above and the   \n      successor firm is a non-U.S. entity.    \n      If that happens, then those             \n      events must arise under U.S. federal    \n      or state law or the law of the          \n      jurisdiction in which the successor     \n      firm is legally organized; or           \n                                              \n                                              \n      If the applicable prospectus            \n      supplement states that any additional   \n      event of default applies to the         \n      series, that event of                   \n      default occurs.                         \n                                              \nIf we do not pay any money or deliver any\nwarrant property when due with respect to a\nparticular warrant of a series, as described\nin the first bullet point above, that failure\nto make a payment or delivery will not\nconstitute an event of default with respect to\nany other warrant of the same series or any\nother series. Remedies If an Event of Default\nOccurs.If an event of default occurs, the\ntrustee will have special duties. In that\nsituation, the trustee will be obligated to\nuse those of its rights and powers under 70\n\nthe indenture, and to use the same degree of\ncare and skill in doing so, that a prudent\nperson would use in that situation in\nconducting his or her own affairs. Except as\ndescribed in the prior paragraph, the trustee\nis not required to take any action under the\nindenture at the request of any holders unless\nthe holders offer the trustee reasonable\nprotection from expenses and liability. This\nis called an indemnity. If the trustee is\nprovided with an indemnity reasonably\nsatisfactory to it, the holders of a majority\nin number of all warrants of the relevant\nseries may direct the time, method and place\nof conducting any lawsuit or other formal\nlegal action seeking any remedy available to\nthe trustee with respect to that series. These\nmajority holders may also direct the trustee\nin performing any other action under the\nindenture with respect to the warrants of that\nseries. Before you bypass the trustee and\nbring your own lawsuit or other formal legal\naction or take other steps to enforce your\nrights or protect your interests relating to\nany warrant, all of the following must occur:\n                                              \n      The holder of your warrant must give    \n      the trustee written notice that an      \n      event of default has occurred, and the  \n      event of                                \n      default must not have been cured or     \n      waived;                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      The holders of not less than 25% in     \n      number of all warrants of your series   \n      must make a written request that the    \n      trustee take                            \n      action because of the default, and      \n      they or other holders must offer to     \n      the trustee indemnity reasonably        \n      satisfactory to the trustee against     \n      the cost and other liabilities of       \n      taking that action;                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      The trustee must not have taken action  \n      for 60 days after the above steps have  \n      been taken; and                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      During those 60 days, the holders of a  \n      majority in number of the warrants of   \n      your series must not have given the     \n      trustee                                 \n      directions that are inconsistent with   \n      the written request of the holders of   \n      not less than 25% in number of the      \n      warrants of your series.                \n                                              \nYou are entitled at any time to bring a\nlawsuit for the payment of any money or\ndelivery of any warrant property due on your\nwarrant on or after its payment or settlement\ndate. Waiver of Default.The holders of not\nless than a majority in number of the warrants\nof any series may waive a default for all\nwarrants of that series. If this happens, the\ndefault will be treated as if it has not\noccurred. No one can waive a default in\npayment of any money or delivery of any\nwarrant property due on any warrant, however,\nwithout the approval of the particular holder\nof that warrant. We Will Give the Trustee\nInformation About Defaults Annually.We will\nfurnish to the trustee every year a written\nstatement of two of our officers certifying\nthat to their knowledge we are in compliance\nwith the indenture and the warrants issued\nunder it, or else specifying any default under\nthe indenture. Book-entry and other indirect\nowners should consult their banks or brokers\nfor information on how to give notice or\ndirection to or make a request of the trustee.\nBook-entry and other indirect owners are\ndescribed below under \u0093Legal Ownership and\nBook-Entry Issuance\u0094. Modification of the\nWarrant Indenture and Waiver of Covenants\nThere are three types of changes we can make\nto the warrant indenture and the warrants of\nany series issued under that indenture. 71\n\nChanges Requiring Each Holder\u0092s\nApproval.First, there are changes that cannot\nbe made without the approval of each holder of\na warrant affected by the change. Here is a\nlist of those types of changes:\n                                              \n      change the exercise price of the        \n      warrant;                                \n                                              \n                                              \n      change the terms of any warrant with    \n      respect to the payment or settlement    \n      date of the warrant;                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      reduce the amount of money payable or   \n      reduce the amount or change the kind    \n      of warrant property deliverable upon    \n      the                                     \n      exercise of the warrant or any premium  \n      payable upon redemption of the          \n      warrant;                                \n                                              \n                                              \n      change the currency of any payment on   \n      a warrant;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      change the place of payment on a        \n      warrant;                                \n                                              \n                                              \n      permit redemption of a warrant if not   \n      previously permitted;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n      impair a holder\u0092s right to exercise its  \n      warrant, or sue for payment of any      \n      money payable or delivery of any        \n      warrant                                 \n      property deliverable with respect to    \n      its warrant on or after the payment or  \n      settlement date or, in the case of      \n      redemption, the redemption date;        \n                                              \n                                              \n      if any warrant provides that the        \n      holder may require us to repurchase     \n      the warrant, impair the holder\u0092s right   \n      to require                              \n      repurchase of the warrant;              \n                                              \n                                              \n      reduce the percentage in number of the  \n      warrants of any one or more affected    \n      series, taken separately or together,   \n      as                                      \n      applicable, the approval of whose       \n      holders is needed to change the         \n      indenture or those warrants;            \n                                              \n                                              \n      reduce the percentage in number of the  \n      warrants of any one or more affected    \n      series, taken separately or together,   \n      as                                      \n      applicable, the consent of whose        \n      holders is needed to waive our          \n      compliance with the indenture or to     \n      waive defaults; and                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      change the provisions of the indenture  \n      dealing with modification and waiver    \n      in any other respect, except to         \n      increase any                            \n      required percentage referred to above   \n      or to add to the provisions that        \n      cannot be changed or waived without     \n      approval of the holder of each          \n      affected warrant.                       \n                                              \nChanges Not Requiring Approval.The second type\nof change does not require any approval by\nholders of the warrants of an affected series.\nThese changes are limited to clarifications\nand changes that would not adversely affect\nthe warrants of that series in any material\nrespect. Nor do we need any approval to make\nchanges that affect only warrants to be issued\nunder the indenture after the changes take\neffect. We may also make changes or obtain\nwaivers that do not adversely affect a\nparticular warrant, even if they affect other\nwarrants. In those cases, we do not need to\nobtain the approval of the holder of that\nwarrant; we need only obtain any required\napprovals from the holders of the affected\nwarrants. Changes Requiring Majority\nApproval.Any other change to the indenture and\nthe warrants issued under the indenture would\nrequire the following approval:\n                                              \n      If the change affects only the          \n      warrants of a particular series, it     \n      must be approved by the holders of a    \n      majority in number                      \n      of the warrants of that series.         \n                                              \n                                              \n      If the change affects the warrants of   \n      more than one series issued under the   \n      indenture, it must be approved by the   \n      holders                                 \n      of a majority in number of all series   \n      affected by the change, with the        \n      warrants of all the affected series     \n      voting together as one class for this   \n      purpose.                                \n                                              \n72\n\nIn each case, the required approval must be\ngiven by written consent. The same majority\napproval would be required for us to obtain a\nwaiver of any of our covenants in the\nindenture. Our covenants include the promises\nwe make about merging and putting liens on our\ninterests in GS&Co., which we describe above\nunder \u0093\u0097 Mergers and Similar Transactions\u0094 and\n\u0093\u0097 Restriction on Liens\u0094. If the holders\napprove a waiver of a covenant, we will not\nhave to comply with it. The holders, however,\ncannot approve a waiver of any provision in a\nparticular warrant, or in the indenture as it\naffects that warrant, that we cannot change\nwithout the approval of the holder of that\nwarrant as described above in \u0093\u0097 Changes\nRequiring Each Holder\u0092s Approval\u0094, unless that\nholder approves the waiver. Book-entry and\nother indirect owners should consult their\nbanks or brokers for information on how\napproval may be granted or denied if we seek\nto change the warrant indenture or any\nwarrants or request a waiver. Special Rules\nfor Action by Holders When holders take any\naction under the warrant indenture, such as\ngiving a notice of default, approving any\nchange or waiver or giving the trustee an\ninstruction, we will apply the following\nrules. Only Outstanding Warrants Are\nEligible.Only holders of outstanding warrants\nof the applicable series will be eligible to\nparticipate in any action by holders of\nwarrants of that series. Also, we will count\nonly outstanding warrants in determining\nwhether the various percentage requirements\nfor taking action have been met. For these\npurposes, a warrant will not be \u0093outstanding\u0094\nif:\n                                              \n      it has been surrendered for             \n      cancellation;                           \n                                              \n                                          \n      it has been called for redemption;  \n                                          \n                                              \n      we have deposited or set aside, in      \n      trust for its holder, money or warrant  \n      property for its payment or             \n      settlement; or                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      we or one of our affiliates, such as    \n      GS&Co., is the owner.                   \n                                              \nDetermining Record Dates for Action by\nHolders.We will generally be entitled to set\nany day as a record date for the purpose of\ndetermining the holders that are entitled to\ntake action under the indenture. In certain\nlimited circumstances, only the trustee will\nbe entitled to set a record date for action by\nholders. If we or the trustee set a record\ndate for an approval or other action to be\ntaken by holders, that vote or action may be\ntaken only by persons or entities who are\nholders on the record date and must be taken\nduring the period that we specify for this\npurpose, or that the trustee specifies if it\nsets the record date. We or the trustee, as\napplicable, may shorten or lengthen this\nperiod from time to time. This period,\nhowever, may not extend beyond the 180th day\nafter the record date for the action. In\naddition, record dates for any global warrant\nmay be set in accordance with procedures\nestablished by the depositary from time to\ntime. Accordingly, record dates for global\nwarrants may differ from those for other\nwarrants. Redemption We will not be entitled\nto redeem your warrant before its expiration\ndate unless your prospectus supplement\nspecifies a redemption commencement date. If\nyour prospectus supplement specifies a\nredemption commencement date, it will also\nspecify one or more redemption prices. It may\nalso specify one or more redemption periods\nduring which the redemption prices relating to\na redemption of warrants during those periods\nwill apply. 73\n\nIf your prospectus supplement specifies a\nredemption commencement date, your warrant\nwill be redeemable at our option at any time\non or after that date or at a specified time\nor times. If we redeem your warrant, we will\ndo so at the specified redemption price. If\ndifferent prices are specified for different\nredemption periods, the price we pay will be\nthe price that applies to the redemption\nperiod during which your warrant is redeemed.\nIf we exercise an option to redeem any\nwarrant, we will give to the holder written\nnotice of the redemption price of the warrant\nto be redeemed, not less than 30 days nor more\nthan 60 days before the applicable redemption\ndate or within any other period before the\napplicable redemption date specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. We will give\nthe notice in the manner described below in \u0093\u0097\nNotices\u0094. We or our affiliates may purchase\nwarrants from investors who are willing to\nsell from time to time, either in the open\nmarket at prevailing prices or in private\ntransactions at negotiated prices. Warrants\nthat we or they purchase may, at our\ndiscretion, be held, resold or canceled. Form,\nExchange and Transfer of Warrants We will\nissue each warrant in global \u0097 i.e., book-\nentry \u0097 form only, unless we say otherwise in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement. Warrants\nin book-entry form will be represented by a\nglobal security registered in the name of a\ndepositary, which will be the holder of all\nthe warrants represented by the global\nsecurity. Those who own beneficial interests\nin a global warrant will do so through\nparticipants in the depositary\u0092s system, and\nthe rights of these indirect owners will be\ngoverned solely by the applicable procedures\nof the depositary and its participants. We\ndescribe book-entry securities below under\n\u0093Legal Ownership and Book-Entry Issuance\u0094. If\na warrant is issued as a registered global\nwarrant, only the depositary \u0097 e.g.,DTC,\nEuroclear and Clearstream \u0097 will be entitled\nto transfer and exchange the warrant as\ndescribed in this subsection, since the\ndepositary will be the sole holder of the\nwarrant. If any warrants cease to be issued in\nregistered global form, they will be issued:\n                                          \n      only in fully registered form; and  \n                                          \n                                              \n      only in the denominations specified in  \n      your prospectus supplement.             \n                                              \nHolders may exchange their warrants for\nwarrants of smaller denominations or combined\ninto fewer warrants of larger denominations,\nas long as the total number of warrants is not\nchanged. Holders may exchange or transfer\ntheir warrants at the office of the trustee.\nThey may also replace lost, stolen, destroyed\nor mutilated warrants at that office. We have\nappointed the trustee to act as our agent for\nregistering warrants in the names of holders\nand transferring and replacing warrants. We\nmay, without your approval, appoint another\nentity to perform these functions or perform\nthem ourselves. Holders will not be required\nto pay a service charge to transfer or\nexchange their warrants, but they may be\nrequired to pay for any tax or other\ngovernmental charge associated with the\ntransfer or exchange. The transfer or\nexchange, and any replacement, will be made\nonly if our transfer agent is satisfied with\nthe holder\u0092s proof of legal ownership. The\ntransfer agent may require an indemnity before\nreplacing any warrants. If we have the right\nto redeem, accelerate or settle any warrants\nbefore their expiration, and we exercise our\nright as to less than all those warrants, we\nmay block the transfer or exchange of those 74\n\nwarrants during the period beginning 15 days\nbefore the day we mail the notice of exercise\nand ending on the day of that mailing or\nduring any other period specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, in order to\nfreeze the list of holders to prepare the\nmailing. We may also refuse to register\ntransfers of or exchange any warrant selected\nfor early settlement, except that we will\ncontinue to permit transfers and exchanges of\nthe unsettled portion of any warrant being\npartially settled. If we have designated\nadditional transfer agents for your warrant,\nthey will be named in your prospectus\nsupplement. We may, without your approval,\nappoint additional transfer agents or cancel\nthe appointment of any particular transfer\nagent. We may also approve a change in the\noffice through which any transfer agent acts.\nThe rules for exchange described above apply\nto exchange of warrants for other warrants of\nthe same series and kind. If a warrant is\nexercisable for a different kind of security,\nsuch as one that we have not issued, or for\nother property, the rules governing that type\nof exercise will be described in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. Payment\nMechanics for Warrants Who Receives Payment?If\nmoney is due on a warrant at its payment or\nsettlement date, we will pay the amount to the\nholder of the warrant against surrender of the\nwarrant at a proper place of payment or, in\nthe case of a global warrant, in accordance\nwith the applicable policies of the\ndepositary, Euroclear and Clearstream, as\napplicable. How We Will Make Payments Due in\nU.S. Dollars.We will follow the practice\ndescribed in this subsection when paying\namounts due in U.S. dollars. Payments of\namounts due in other currencies will be made\nas described in the next subsection.\n                                              \n      Payments on Global Warrants. We will    \n      make payments on a global warrant in    \n      accordance with the applicable          \n      policies of the depositary as in        \n      effect from time to time. Under those   \n      policies, we will pay directly to the   \n      depositary, or its nominee, and not to  \n      any indirect owners who own beneficial  \n      interests in the global warrant. An     \n      indirect owner\u0092s                         \n      right to receive those payments will    \n      be governed by the rules and practices  \n      of the depositary and its               \n      participants, as described in the       \n      section entitled \u0093Legal Ownership and    \n      Book-Entry Issuance \u0097 What Is a Global   \n      Security?\u0094.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      Payments on Non-Global Warrants. We     \n      will make payments on a warrant         \n      in non-global, registered form as       \n      follows. We will make all payments by   \n      check at the paying agent described     \n      below, against surrender of the         \n      warrant. All payments by check will be  \n      made in next-day funds \u0097 i.e., funds     \n      that become available on the day after  \n      the check is cashed.                    \n                                              \nAlternatively, if a non-globalwarrant has an\noriginal issue price of at least $1,000,000\n(or the equivalent in another currency) and\nthe holder asks us to do so, we will pay any\namount that becomes due on the warrant by wire\ntransfer of immediately available funds to an\naccount at a bank in New York City, on the\npayment or settlement date. To request wire\npayment, the holder must give the paying agent\nappropriate wire transfer instructions at\nleast five business days before the requested\nwire payment is due. Payment will be made only\nafter the warrant is surrendered to the paying\nagent. Book-entry and other indirect owners\nshould consult their banks or brokers for\ninformation on how they will receive payments\non their warrants. How We Will Make Payments\nDue in Other Currencies.We will follow the\npractice described in this subsection when\npaying amounts that are due in a specified\ncurrency other than U.S. dollars. 75\n\nPayments on Global Warrants. We will make\npayments on a global warrant in the applicable\nspecified currency in accordance with the\napplicable policies as in effect from time to\ntime of the depositary, which may be DTC,\nEuroclear or Clearstream. Unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, The Depository Trust\nCompany, New York, New York, known as DTC,\nwill be the depositary for all warrants in\nglobal form.\n\nIndirect owners of a global warrant\ndenominated in a currency other than U.S.\ndollars should consult their banks or brokers\nfor information on how to request payment in\nthe specified currency in cases where holders\nhave a right to do so.\n\nPayments on Non-GlobalWarrants. Except as\ndescribed in the last paragraph under this\nheading, we will make payments on warrants in\nnon-global form in the applicable\nspecified currency. We will make these\npayments by wire transfer of immediately\navailable funds to any account that is\nmaintained in the applicable specified\ncurrency at a bank designated by the holder\nand is acceptable to us and the trustee. To\ndesignate an account for wire payment, the\nholder must give the paying agent appropriate\nwire instructions at least five business days\nbefore the requested wire payment is due. The\npayment will be made only after the warrant is\nsurrendered to the\npaying agent.\n\nIf a holder fails to give instructions as\ndescribed above, we will notify the holder at\nthe address in the trustee\u0092s records and\nwill make the payment within five business\ndays after the holder provides appropriate\ninstructions. Any late payment made in these\ncircumstances will be treated under the\nindenture as if made on the payment or\nsettlement date, and no interest will\naccrue on the late payment from the payment or\nsettlement date to the date paid.\n\nAlthough a payment on a warrant in\nnon-global form may be due in a specified\ncurrency other than U.S. dollars, we will make\nthe payment in U.S. dollars if your prospectus\nsupplement specifies that holders may ask us\nto do so and you make such a\nrequest. To request U.S. dollar payment in\nthese circumstances, the holder must provide\nappropriate written notice to the trustee at\nleast five business days before the payment or\nsettlement date for which payment in U.S.\ndollars is requested.\n\nBook-entry and other indirect owners of a\nwarrant with a specified currency other than\nU.S. dollars should contact their banks or\nbrokers for information about how to receive\npayments in the specified currency or in U.S.\ndollars.\n\nConversion to U.S. Dollars. Unless otherwise\nindicated in your prospectus supplement,\nholders are not entitled to receive payments\nin U.S. dollars of an amount due in another\ncurrency, either on a global warrant or a\nnon-global warrant.\n\nIf your prospectus supplement specifies that\nholders may request that we make payments\nin U.S. dollars of an amount due in another\ncurrency, the exchange rate agent described\nbelow will calculate the U.S. dollar amount\nthe holder receives in the exchange rate\nagent\u0092s discretion. A holder that requests\npayment in U.S. dollars will\nbear all associated currency exchange costs,\nwhich will be deducted from the payment.\n\nWhen the Specified Currency Is Not Available.\nIf we are obligated to make any payment in a\nspecified currency other than U.S. dollars,\nand the specified currency or any successor\ncurrency is not available to us due to\ncircumstances beyond our control \u0097 such as the\nimposition of exchange\ncontrols or a disruption in the currency\nmarkets \u0097 we will be entitled to satisfy our\nobligation to make the payment in that\nspecified currency by making the payment in\nU.S. dollars, on the basis of the exchange\nrate determined by the exchange\nrate agent described below, in its discretion.\n\n76\n\nThe foregoing will apply to any warrant,\nwhether in global or non-globalform, and to\nany payment, including a payment at the\npayment or settlement date. Any payment made\nunder the circumstances and in a manner\ndescribed above will not result in a default\nunder any warrant or the indenture. Exchange\nRate Agent.If we issue a warrant in a\nspecified currency other than U.S. dollars, we\nwill appoint a financial institution to act as\nthe exchange rate agent and will name the\ninstitution initially appointed when the\nwarrant is originally issued in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. We may select GS&Co. or\nanother of our affiliates to perform this\nrole. We may change the exchange rate agent\nfrom time to time after the original issue\ndate of the warrant without your consent and\nwithout notifying you of the change. All\ndeterminations made by the exchange rate agent\nwill be in its sole discretion unless we state\nin the applicable prospectus supplement that\nany determination requires our approval. In\nthe absence of manifest error, those\ndeterminations will be conclusive for all\npurposes and binding on you and us, without\nany liability on the part of the exchange rate\nagent. Payment When Offices Are Closed.Unless\notherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, if any payment or\ndelivery of warrant property is due on a\nwarrant on a day that is not a business day,\nwe will make the payment or delivery on the\nnext day that is a business day. Payments or\ndeliveries postponed to the next business day\nin this situation will be treated under the\nindenture as if they were made on the original\npayment or settlement date. Postponement of\nthis kind will not result in a default under\nany warrant or the indenture, and, unless\notherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, no interest will accrue\non the postponed amount from the original\npayment or settlement date to the next day\nthat is a business day. The term \u0093business\nday\u0094 means, for any warrant, a day that meets\nall the following applicable requirements:\n                                              \n      for all warrants, is a Monday,          \n      Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday  \n      that is not a day on which banking      \n      institutions in                         \n      New York City are authorized or         \n      obligated by law or executive order to  \n      close and that satisfies any other      \n      criteria specified in your prospectus   \n      supplement; and                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      if the warrant has a specified          \n      currency other than U.S. dollars or     \n      euros, is also a day on which banking   \n      institutions are                        \n      not authorized or obligated by law,     \n      regulation or executive order to close  \n      in the principal financial center of    \n      the country issuing the specified       \n      currency.                               \n                                              \nPaying Agent.We may appoint one or more\nfinancial institutions to act as our paying\nagents, at whose designated offices warrants\nin non-globalform may be surrendered for\npayment at their payment or settlement date.\nWe call each of those offices a paying agent.\nWe may add, replace or terminate paying agents\nfrom time to time. We may also choose to act\nas our own paying agent. Initially, we have\nappointed the trustee, at its corporate trust\noffice in New York City, as the paying agent.\nWe must notify the trustee of changes in the\npaying agents. Unclaimed Payments.Regardless\nof who acts as paying agent, all money paid or\nwarrant property delivered by us to a paying\nagent that remains unclaimed at the end of two\nyears after the amount is due to a holder will\nbe repaid or redelivered to us. After that\ntwo-yearperiod, the holder may look only to us\nfor payment of any money or delivery of any\nwarrant property, and not to the trustee, any\nother paying agent or anyone else. Notices\nNotices to be given to holders of a global\nwarrant will be given only to the depositary,\nin accordance with its applicable policies as\nin effect from time to time. Notices to be\ngiven to holders of 77\n\nwarrants not in global form will be sent by\nmail to the respective addresses of the\nholders as they appear in the trustee\u0092s\nrecords, and will be deemed given when mailed.\nNeither the failure\nto give any notice to a particular holder, nor\nany defect in a notice given to a particular\nholder, will affect the sufficiency of any\nnotice given to another holder.\n\nBook-entry and other indirect owners should\nconsult their banks or brokers for information\non how they will receive notices.\n\nOur Relationship With the Trustee\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon has provided\ncommercial banking and other services for us\nand our affiliates in the past and may do so\nin the future. Among\nother things, The Bank of New York Mellon\nprovides us with a line of credit, holds debt\nsecurities issued by us and serves as trustee\nor agent with regard to other warrants and\ndebt obligations of The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. or its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon is initially\nserving as the trustee for the warrants issued\nunder the warrant indenture and for the senior\ndebt\nsecurities and subordinated debt securities.\nConsequently, if an actual or potential event\nof default occurs with respect to any of these\nsecurities, the trustee may be considered to\nhave a conflicting interest for purposes of\nthe Trust Indenture\nAct of 1939. In that case, the trustee may be\nrequired to resign under one or more of the\nindentures, and we would be required to\nappoint a successor trustee. For this purpose,\na \u0093potential\u0094 event of default means an event\nthat would be an\nevent of default if the requirements for\ngiving us default notice or for the default\nhaving to exist for a specific period of time\nwere disregarded.\n\nIn addition, affiliates of the trustee may\nunderwrite our warrants from time to time in\nthe future. The trustee may have to resign if\na default occurs\nwith respect to the warrants within one year\nafter any offering of our warrants\nunderwritten by an affiliate of the trustee,\nsuch as BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, since\nthe trustee would likely be considered to have\na conflicting interest for\npurposes of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.\nIn that event, except in very limited\ncircumstances, the trustee would be required\nto resign as trustee under one or more of the\nindentures and we would be required to appoint\na successor trustee, unless\nthe default is cured or waived within 90 days.\nIn addition, the trustee can resign for any\nreason with 60 days\u0092 notice, and we would be\nrequired to appoint a successor trustee. If\nthe trustee resigns following a default or for\nany other reason,\nit may be difficult to identify and appoint a\nqualified successor trustee. The trustee will\nremain the trustee under the indenture until a\nsuccessor is appointed. During the period of\ntime until a successor is appointed, the\ntrustee will have both\n(a) duties to noteholders under the indenture\nand (b) a conflicting interest under the\nindenture for purposes of the Trust Indenture\nAct.\n\nGeneral Provisions of Warrant Agreements\n\nWe\nmay issue debt warrants and some universal\nwarrants in one or more series under one or\nmore warrant agreements, each to be entered\ninto between us and a bank, trust company or\nother financial institution as warrant agent.\nWe may add, replace or\nterminate warrant agents from time to time. We\nmay also choose to act as our own warrant\nagent. We will describe the warrant agreement\nunder which we issue any warrants in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, and we will\nfile that agreement with\nthe SEC, either as an exhibit to an amendment\nto the registration statement of which this\nprospectus is a part or as an exhibit to a\ncurrent report on Form 8-K. See \u0093Available\nInformation\u0094 above for\ninformation on how to obtain a copy of a\nwarrant agreement when it is filed.\n\nWe may also issue universal warrants under the\nwarrant indenture. For\nthese warrants, the applicable provisions of\nthe warrant indenture described above would\napply instead of the provisions described in\nthis section.\n\n78\n\nEnforcement of Rights The warrant agent under\na warrant agreement will act solely as our\nagent in connection with the warrants issued\nunder that agreement. The warrant agent will\nnot assume any obligation or relationship of\nagency or trust for or with any holders of\nthose warrants. Any holder of warrants may,\nwithout the consent of any other person,\nenforce by appropriate legal action, on its\nown behalf, its right to exercise those\nwarrants in accordance with their terms. No\nholder of any warrant will be entitled to any\nrights of a holder of the debt securities or\nwarrant property purchasable upon exercise of\nthe warrant, including any right to receive\npayments on those debt securities or warrant\nproperty or to enforce any covenants or rights\nin the relevant indenture or any other\nagreement. Modifications Without Consent of\nHolders We and the applicable warrant agent\nmay amend any warrant or warrant agreement\nwithout the consent of any holder:\n                              \n      to cure any ambiguity;  \n                              \n                                              \n      to cure, correct or supplement any      \n      defective or inconsistent provision;    \n      or                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      to make any other change that we        \n      believe is necessary or desirable and   \n      will not adversely affect the           \n      interests of the                        \n      affected holders in any material        \n      respect.                                \n                                              \nWe do not need any approval to make changes\nthat affect only warrants to be issued after\nthe changes take effect. We may also make\nchanges that do not adversely affect a\nparticular warrant in any material respect,\neven if they adversely affect other warrants\nin a material respect. In those cases, we do\nnot need to obtain the approval of the holder\nof the unaffected warrant; we need only obtain\nany required approvals from the holders of the\naffected warrants. Modifications with Consent\nof Holders We may not amend any particular\nwarrant or a warrant agreement with respect to\nany particular warrant unless we obtain the\nconsent of the holder of that warrant, if the\namendment would:\n                                              \n      change the exercise price of the        \n      warrant;                                \n                                              \n                                              \n      change the kind or reduce the amount    \n      of the warrant property or other        \n      consideration receivable upon           \n      exercise, cancellation                  \n      or expiration of the warrant;           \n                                              \n                                              \n      shorten, advance or defer the period    \n      of time during which the holder may     \n      exercise the warrant or otherwise       \n      impair the                              \n      holder\u0092s right to exercise the warrant;  \n      or                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      reduce the percentage of outstanding,   \n      unexpired warrants of any series or     \n      class the consent of whose holders is   \n      required to                             \n      amend the series or class, or the       \n      applicable warrant agreement with       \n      regard to that series or class, as      \n      described below.                        \n                                              \nAny other change to a particular warrant\nagreement and the warrants issued under that\nagreement would require the following\napproval:\n                                              \n      If the change affects only the          \n      warrants of a particular series issued  \n      under that agreement, the change must   \n      be approved by                          \n      the holders of a majority of the        \n      outstanding, unexpired warrants of      \n      that series.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      If the change affects the warrants of   \n      more than one series issued under that  \n      agreement, the change must be approved  \n      by the                                  \n      holders of a majority of all            \n      outstanding, unexpired warrants of all  \n      series affected by the change, with     \n      the warrants of all the affected        \n      series voting together as one class     \n      for this purpose.                       \n                                              \n79\n\nIn each case, the required approval must be\ngiven in writing.\n\nWarrant Agreement Will Not Be Qualified Under\nTrust Indenture Act\n\nNo warrant agreement will be qualified as an\nindenture, and no warrant agent will be\nrequired to qualify as a trustee, under the\nTrust Indenture Act.\nTherefore, holders of warrants issued under a\nwarrant agreement will not have the protection\nof the Trust Indenture Act with respect to\ntheir warrants.\n\nMergers and Similar Transactions Permitted; No\nRestrictive Covenants or Events of Default\n\nThe warrant agreements and any warrants issued\nunder the warrant agreements will not restrict\nour ability to merge or consolidate with, or\nsell our\nassets to, another corporation or other entity\nor to engage in any other transactions. If at\nany time we merge or consolidate with, or sell\nour assets substantially as an entirety to,\nanother corporation or other entity, the\nsuccessor entity will\nsucceed to and assume our obligations under\nthe warrants and warrant agreements. We will\nthen be relieved of any further obligation\nunder the warrants and warrant agreements.\n\nThe warrant agreements and any warrants issued\nunder the warrant agreements will not include\nany restrictions on our ability to put liens\non our assets,\nincluding our interests in our subsidiaries,\nnor will they restrict our ability to sell our\nassets. The warrant agreements and any\nwarrants issued under the warrant agreements\nalso will not provide for any events of\ndefault or remedies upon the\noccurrence of any events of default.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nEach warrant agreement and any warrants issued\nunder the warrant agreements will be governed\nby New York law.\n\nForm, Exchange and Transfer\n\nWe will issue each\nwarrant in global \u0097 i.e., book-entry \u0097 form\nonly, unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. Warrants in\nbook-entry form will be represented by a\nglobal security registered in the name of a\ndepositary,\nwhich will be the holder of all the warrants\nrepresented by the global security. Those who\nown beneficial interests in a global warrant\nwill do so through participants in the\ndepositary\u0092s system, and the rights of these\nindirect owners will be\ngoverned solely by the applicable procedures\nof the depositary and its participants. We\ndescribe book-entry securities below under\n\u0093Legal Ownership and Book-Entry Issuance\u0094.\n\nIn addition, we will issue each warrant in\nregistered form.\n\nIf any warrants are issued in non-global form,\nthe following will apply to them:\n\nThe warrants will be issued in fully\nregistered form in denominations stated in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. Holders may\nexchange their\nwarrants for warrants of smaller denominations\nor combined into fewer warrants of larger\ndenominations, as long as the total number of\nwarrants is not changed.\n\nHolders may exchange or transfer their\nwarrants at the office of the warrant agent.\nThey may also replace lost, stolen, destroyed\nor mutilated warrants\nat that office. We may appoint another entity\nto perform these functions or perform them\nourselves.\n\nHolders will not be required to pay a service\ncharge to transfer or exchange their warrants,\nbut they may be required to pay any tax or\nother governmental charge associated with the\ntransfer or\n\n80\n\nexchange. The transfer or exchange, and any\nreplacement, will be made only if our transfer\nagent is satisfied with the holder\u0092s proof of\nlegal ownership. The transfer agent may also\nrequire\nan indemnity before replacing any warrants.\n\nIf we have the right to redeem, accelerate or\nsettle any warrants before their expiration,\nand we\nexercise our right as to less than all those\nwarrants, we may block the transfer or\nexchange of those warrants during the period\nbeginning 15 days before the day we mail the\nnotice of exercise and ending on the day of\nthat mailing, in order to\nfreeze the list of holders to prepare the\nmailing. We may also refuse to register\ntransfers of or exchange any warrant selected\nfor early settlement, except that we will\ncontinue to permit transfers and exchanges of\nthe unsettled portion of any\nwarrant being partially settled.\n\nOnly the depositary will be entitled to\ntransfer or exchange a warrant in global form,\nsince it will be the sole\nholder of the warrant.\n\nPayments and Notices\n\nIn\nmaking payments and giving notices with\nrespect to our warrants issued under warrant\nagreements, we will follow the procedures we\nplan to use with respect to our warrants\nissued under the warrant indenture, where\napplicable. We describe these\nprocedures above under \u0093\u0097 General Provisions\nof Warrant Indenture \u0097 Payment Mechanics for\nWarrants\u0094 and \u0093\u0097 Notices\u0094.\n\nCalculation Agent\n\nCalculations relating to\nwarrants will be made by the calculation\nagent, an institution that we appoint as our\nagent for this purpose. That institution may\ninclude any affiliate of ours, such as GS&Co.\nThe prospectus supplement for a particular\nwarrant will name the\ninstitution that we have appointed to act as\nthe calculation agent for that warrant as of\nits original issue date. We may appoint a\ndifferent institution to serve as calculation\nagent from time to time after the original\nissue date of the warrant\nwithout your consent and without notifying you\nof the change.\n\nThe calculation agent\u0092s determination of any\namount of money payable or warrant\nproperty deliverable with respect to a warrant\nwill be final and binding in the absence of\nmanifest error.\n\nAll percentages resulting from any\ncalculation relating to a warrant will be\nrounded upward or downward, as appropriate, to\nthe next higher or lower one hundred-\nthousandth of a percentage point,\ne.g.,9.876541% (or .09876541) being rounded\ndown to 9.87654% (or .0987654) and\n9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded up to\n9.87655% (or .0987655). All amounts used in or\nresulting from any calculation relating to a\nwarrant will be rounded upward or downward, as\nappropriate, to the nearest cent, in the case\nof U.S. dollars, or\nto the nearest corresponding hundredth of a\nunit, in the case of a currency other than\nU.S. dollars, with one-half cent or one-half\nof a corresponding hundredth of a\nunit or more being rounded upward.\n\n81\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PURCHASE CONTRACTS WE MAY OFFER\nPlease note that in this section entitled\n\u0093Description of Purchase Contracts We May\nOffer\u0094, references to \u0093The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc.\u0094, \u0093we\u0094, \u0093our\u0094 and \u0093us\u0094 refer only\nto The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and not to\nits consolidated subsidiaries.

Each purchase\ncontract will obligate:\n                                              \n      the holder to purchase or sell, and     \n      obligate us to sell or purchase, on     \n      specified dates, one or more purchase   \n      contract                                \n      properties at a specified price or      \n      prices; or                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      the holder or us to settle the          \n      purchase contract by reference to the   \n      value, performance or level of one or   \n      more purchase                           \n      contract properties, on specified       \n      dates and at a specified price or       \n      prices.                                 \n                                              \nSome purchase contracts may include multiple\nobligations to purchase or sell different\npurchase contract properties, and both we and\nthe holder may be sellers or buyers under the\nsame purchase contract. No holder of a\npurchase contract will have any rights of a\nholder of the purchase contract property\npurchasable under the contract, including any\nright to receive payments on that property. An\ninvestment in purchase contracts may involve\nspecial risks, including risks associated with\nindexed securities and currency-related risks\nif the purchase contract or purchase contract\nproperty is linked to an index or is payable\nin or otherwise linked to a non-U.S.dollar\ncurrency. We describe some of these risks\nbelow under \u0093Considerations Relating to\nIndexed Securities\u0094 and \u0093Considerations\nRelating to Securities Denominated or Payable\nin or Linked to a Non-U.S.Dollar Currency\u0094.\nBecause we are a holding company, our ability\nto perform our obligations on the purchase\ncontracts will depend in part on our ability\nto participate in distributions of assets from\nour subsidiaries. We discuss these matters\nabove under \u0093Description of Debt Securities We\nMay Offer \u0097 We Are a Holding Company\u0094. 82\n\nOur affiliates may resell purchase contracts\nafter their initial issuance in market-making\ntransactions. We describe these transactions\nabove under \u0093Description of Debt Securities We\nMay Offer \u0097 Information in Your Prospectus\nSupplement \u0097 Market-Making Transactions\u0094.\n\nWe May Issue Many Series of Purchase Contracts\n\nWe have no restrictions on the number of\npurchase contracts or number of distinct\nseries of purchase contracts we may issue. We\nmay also\n\u0093reopen\u0094 a previously issued series of\npurchase contracts and issue additional\npurchase contracts of that series. In\naddition, we may issue a purchase contract\nseparately or as part of a unit, as described\nbelow under \u0093Description of\nUnits We May Offer\u0094.\n\nThis section summarizes terms of the purchase\ncontracts that apply generally to all purchase\ncontracts. We describe the\nspecific terms of your purchase contract in\nthe prospectus supplement accompanying this\nprospectus. Those terms may vary from the\nterms described here.\n\nAs you read this section, please remember that\nthe specific terms of your purchase contract\nas described in your prospectus supplement\nwill supplement and, if applicable, may modify\nor replace the general terms described in this\nsection. If there are differences between your\nprospectus supplement and this prospectus,\nyour prospectus supplement will control. Thus,\nthe statements we make in this section may not\napply to your purchase contract.\n\nWhen we refer to a series of purchase\ncontracts, we\nmean all the purchase contracts issued as part\nof the same series under the applicable\ngoverning instrument. When we refer to your\nprospectus supplement, we mean the prospectus\nsupplement describing the specific terms of\nthe purchase contract you\npurchase. The terms used in your prospectus\nsupplement will have the meanings described in\nthis prospectus, unless otherwise specified.\n\nPrepaid Purchase Contracts; Applicability of\nDebt Indentures\n\nSome purchase contracts may require the\nholders to satisfy their obligations under the\ncontracts at the time the contracts are\nissued. We refer to those contracts as\n\u0093prepaid purchase contracts\u0094. Our obligation\nto settle a prepaid purchase contract on the\nrelevant settlement date will be one of our\nsenior debt securities or\nsubordinated debt securities, which are\ndescribed above under \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities We May Offer\u0094. Prepaid purchase\ncontracts will be issued under the applicable\ndebt indenture, and the provisions of that\ndebt indenture will\ngovern those contracts.\n\nNon-PrepaidPurchase Contracts; No Trust\nIndenture Act Protection\n\nSome purchase contracts do not require the\nholders to satisfy their obligations under the\ncontracts until settlement. We refer to those\ncontracts as \u0093non-prepaid purchase contracts\u0094.\nThe holder of a non-prepaid purchase contract\nmay remain obligated to perform under the\ncontract for a substantial period of time.\n\nNon-prepaid purchase contracts will be issued\nunder a unit agreement, if they are issued in\nunits, or under\nsome other document, if they are not. We\ndescribe unit agreements generally under\n\u0093Description of Units We May Offer\u0094 below. We\nwill describe the particular governing\ndocument that applies to your\nnon-prepaid purchase contracts in the\napplicable prospectus supplement.\n\nNon-prepaid purchase contracts will not be\nsenior debt securities or subordinated debt\nsecurities and will not\nbe issued under one of our indentures.\nConsequently, no governing documents for non-\nprepaid purchase contracts will be qualified\nas indentures, and no third party will be\nrequired to\n\n83\n\nqualify as a trustee with regard to those\ncontracts, under the Trust Indenture Act.\nHolders of non-prepaidpurchase contracts will\nnot have the protection of the Trust Indenture\nAct with respect to those contracts. General\nTerms of Purchase Contracts Your prospectus\nsupplement may contain, where applicable, the\nfollowing information about your purchase\ncontract:\n                                              \n      whether the purchase contract           \n      obligates the holder to purchase or     \n      sell, or both purchase and sell, one    \n      or more purchase                        \n      contract properties and the nature and  \n      amount of each of those properties, or  \n      the method of determining those         \n      amounts;                                \n                                              \n                                              \n      whether the purchase contract is to be  \n      prepaid or not and the governing        \n      document for the contract;              \n                                              \n                                              \n      whether the purchase contract is to be  \n      settled by delivery, or by reference    \n      or linkage to the value, performance    \n      or level                                \n      of, the purchase contract properties;   \n                                              \n                                              \n      any acceleration, cancellation,         \n      termination or other provisions         \n      relating to the settlement of the       \n      purchase contract;                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      whether the purchase contract will be   \n      issued as part of a unit and, if so,    \n      the other securities comprising the     \n      unit and                                \n      whether any unit securities will be     \n      subject to a security interest in our   \n      favor as described below; and           \n                                              \n                                              \n      whether the purchase contract will be   \n      issued in global or non-global form.    \n                                              \nIf we issue a purchase contract as part of a\nunit, the accompanying prospectus supplement\nwill state whether the contract will be\nseparable from the other securities in the\nunit before the contract settlement date. A\npurchase contract issued in a unit in the\nUnited States may not be so separated before\nthe 91st day after the unit is issued.\nAdditional Terms of Non-PrepaidPurchase\nContracts In addition to the general terms\ndescribed above, a non-prepaidpurchase\ncontract may include the following additional\nterms. Pledge by Holders to Secure Performance\nIf we say so in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, the holder\u0092s obligations under the\npurchase contract and governing document will\nbe secured by collateral. In that case, the\nholder, acting through the unit agent as its\nattorney-in-fact,if applicable, will pledge\nthe items described below to a collateral\nagent named in the prospectus supplement,\nwhich will hold them, for our benefit, as\ncollateral to secure the holder\u0092s obligations.\nWe refer to this as the \u0093pledge\u0094 and all the\nitems described below as the \u0093pledged items\u0094.\nThe pledge will create a security interest in\nthe holder\u0092s entire interest in and to:\n                                              \n      any other securities included in the    \n      unit, if the purchase contract is part  \n      of a unit, and/or any other property    \n      specified                               \n      in the applicable prospectus            \n      supplement;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      all additions to and substitutions for  \n      the pledged items;                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      all income, proceeds and collections    \n      received in respect of the pledged      \n      items; and                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      all powers and rights owned or          \n      acquired later with respect to the      \n      pledged items.                          \n                                              \n84\n\nThe collateral agent will forward all payments\nand proceeds from the pledged items to us,\nunless the\npayments and proceeds have been released from\nthe pledge in accordance with the purchase\ncontract and the governing document. We will\nuse the payments and proceeds from the pledged\nitems to satisfy the holder\u0092s obligations\nunder the purchase\ncontract.\n\nSettlement of Purchase Contracts That Are Part\nof Units\n\nThe following will apply to a non-prepaid\npurchase contract that is issued together with\nany of our debt\nsecurities as part of a unit. If the holder\nfails to satisfy its obligations under the\npurchase contract, the unit agent may apply\nthe principal payments on the debt securities\nto satisfy those obligations as provided in\nthe governing document. If\nthe holder is permitted to settle its\nobligations by cash payment, the holder may be\npermitted to do so by delivering the debt\nsecurities in the unit to the unit agent as\nprovided in the governing document.\n\nBook-entry and other indirect owners should\nconsult their banks or brokers for information\non how to settle their purchase contracts.\n\nFailure of Holder to Perform Obligations\n\nIf the holder fails to settle its obligations\nunder a non-prepaid purchase contract as\nrequired, the holder will\nnot receive the purchase contract property or\nother consideration to be delivered at\nsettlement. Holders that fail to make timely\nsettlement may also be obligated to pay\ninterest or other amounts.\n\nAssumption of Obligations by Transferee\n\nWhen the\nholder of a non-prepaid purchase contract\ntransfers the purchase contract to a new\nholder, the new holder will assume the\nobligations of the prior holder with respect\nto the purchase contract, and the prior\nholder will be released from those\nobligations. Under the non-prepaid purchase\ncontract, we will consent to the transfer of\nthe purchase contract, to the assumption of\nthose obligations by the new holder and\nto the release of the prior holder, if the\ntransfer is made in accordance with the\nprovisions of the purchase contract.\n\nMergers and Similar Transactions Permitted; No\nRestrictive Covenants or Events of Default\n\nPurchase contracts that are not prepaid will\nnot restrict our ability to merge or\nconsolidate with, or sell our assets to,\nanother corporation or other entity or to\nengage in any other transactions. If at any\ntime we merge or consolidate with, or sell our\nassets substantially as an entirety to,\nanother corporation or other\nentity, the successor entity will succeed to\nand assume our obligations under these\npurchase contracts. We will then be relieved\nof any further obligation under these purchase\ncontracts.\n\nPurchase contracts that are not prepaid will\nnot include any restrictions on our ability to\nput liens on our assets, including our\ninterests in our\nsubsidiaries, nor will they restrict our\nability to sell our assets. These purchase\ncontracts also will not provide for any events\nof default (or covenant breaches) or remedies\nupon the occurrence of any events of default\n(or covenant breaches).\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe purchase contracts and\nany governing documents will be governed by\nNew York law.\n\n85\n\nForm, Exchange and Transfer We will issue each\npurchase contract in global \u0097 i.e., book-entry\n\u0097 form only, unless we specify otherwise in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement. Purchase\ncontracts in book-entry form will be\nrepresented by a global security registered in\nthe name of a depositary, which will be the\nholder of all the purchase contracts\nrepresented by the global security. Those who\nown beneficial interests in a purchase\ncontract will do so through participants in\nthe depositary\u0092s clearing system, and the\nrights of these indirect owners will be\ngoverned solely by the applicable procedures\nof the depositary and its participants. We\ndescribe book-entry securities below under\n\u0093Legal Ownership and Book-Entry Issuance\u0094. In\naddition, we will issue each purchase contract\nin registered form. If any purchase contracts\nare issued in non-globalform, the following\nwill apply to them:\n                                              \n      The purchase contracts will be issued   \n      in fully registered form in             \n      denominations stated in the applicable  \n      prospectus                              \n      supplement. Holders may exchange their  \n      purchase contracts for contracts of     \n      smaller denominations or combined into  \n      fewer contracts of larger               \n      denominations, as long as the total     \n      amount is not changed.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      Holders may exchange or transfer their  \n      purchase contracts at the office of     \n      the trustee, unit agent or other agent  \n      we name                                 \n      in the applicable prospectus            \n      supplement. Holders may also replace    \n      lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated    \n      purchase contracts at that office. We   \n      may appoint another entity to perform   \n      these functions or perform them         \n      ourselves.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      Holders will not be required to pay a   \n      service charge to transfer or exchange  \n      their purchase contracts, but they may  \n      be                                      \n      required to pay for any tax or other    \n      governmental charge associated with     \n      the transfer or exchange. The transfer  \n      or exchange, and any replacement, will  \n      be made only if our transfer agent is   \n      satisfied with the holder\u0092s proof of     \n      legal ownership.                        \n      The transfer agent may also require an  \n      indemnity before replacing any          \n      purchase contracts.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      If we have the right to redeem,         \n      accelerate or settle any purchase       \n      contracts before their maturity, and    \n      we exercise our                         \n      right as to less than all those         \n      purchase contracts, we may block the    \n      transfer or exchange of those purchase  \n      contracts during the period beginning   \n      15 days before the day we mail the      \n      notice of exercise and ending on the    \n      day of that mailing, in order           \n      to freeze the list of holders to        \n      prepare the mailing. We may also        \n      refuse to register transfers of or      \n      exchange any purchase contract          \n      selected for early settlement, except   \n      that we will continue to permit         \n      transfers and exchanges of the          \n      unsettled                               \n      portion of any purchase contract being  \n      partially settled.                      \n                                              \nOnly the depositary will be entitled to\ntransfer or exchange a purchase contract in\nglobal form, since it will be the sole holder\nof the purchase contract. Payments and Notices\nIn making payments and giving notices with\nrespect to purchase contracts, we will follow\nthe procedures we plan to use with respect to\nour debt securities, when applicable. We\ndescribe these procedures above under\n\u0093Description of Debt Securities We May Offer \u0097\nPayment Mechanics for Debt Securities\u0094 and\n\u0093Description of Debt Securities We May Offer \u0097\nNotices\u0094. 86\n\nDESCRIPTION OF UNITS WE MAY OFFER Please note\nthat in this section entitled \u0093Description of\nUnits We May Offer\u0094, references to \u0093The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0094, \u0093we\u0094, \u0093our\u0094 and\n\u0093us\u0094 refer only to The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. and not to its consolidated subsidiaries.\nAlso, in this section, references to \u0093holders\u0094\nmean those who own units registered in their\nown names, on the books that we or our agent\nmaintain for this purpose, and not those who\nown beneficial interests in units registered\nin street name or in units issued in book-\nentry form through one or more depositaries.\nOwners of beneficial interests in the units\nshould read the section below entitled \u0093Legal\nOwnership and Book-Entry Issuance\u0094. We may\nissue units comprised of one or more debt\nsecurities, warrants, purchase contracts,\nshares of preferred stock and depositary\nshares, as well as debt or equity securities\nof third parties, in any combination. Each\nunit will be issued so that the holder of the\nunit is also the holder of each security\nincluded in the unit. Thus, the holder of a\nunit will have the rights and obligations of a\nholder of each included security. The unit\nagreement under which a unit is issued may\nprovide that the securities included in the\nunit may not be held or transferred\nseparately, at any time or at any time before\na specified date. The applicable prospectus\nsupplement may describe:\n                                              \n      the designation and terms of the units  \n      and of the securities comprising the    \n      units, including whether and under      \n      what                                    \n      circumstances those securities may be   \n      held or transferred separately;         \n                                              \n                                              \n      any provisions of the governing unit    \n      agreement that differ from those        \n      described below; and                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      any provisions for the issuance,        \n      payment, settlement, transfer or        \n      exchange of the units or of the         \n      securities comprising the               \n      units.                                  \n                                              \nThe provisions described in this section, as\nwell as those described under \u0093Description of\nDebt Securities We May Offer\u0094, \u0093Description of\nWarrants We May Offer\u0094, \u0093Description of\nPurchase Contracts We May Offer\u0094 and\n\u0093Description of Preferred Stock We May Offer\u0094,\nwill apply to the securities included in each\nunit, to the extent relevant. An investment in\nunits may involve special risks, including\nrisks associated with indexed securities and\ncurrency-related risks if the securities\ncomprising the units are linked to an index or\nare payable in or otherwise linked to a\nnon-U.S.dollar currency. We describe some of\nthese risks below under \u0093Considerations\nRelating to Indexed Securities\u0094 and\n\u0093Considerations Relating to Securities\nDenominated or Payable in or Linked to a\nNon-U.S.Dollar Currency\u0094. Our affiliates may\nresell units after their initial issuance in\nmarket-making transactions. We discuss these\ntransactions above under \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities We May Offer \u0097 Information in Your\nProspectus Supplement \u0097 Market-Making\nTransactions\u0094. We May Issue Many Series of\nUnits We may issue units in such amounts and\nin as many distinct series as we wish. We may\nalso \u0093reopen\u0094 a previously issued series of\nunits and issue additional units of that\nseries. This section summarizes terms of the\nunits that apply generally to all series. We\ndescribe most of the financial and other\nspecific terms of your series in the\napplicable prospectus supplement accompanying\nthis prospectus. Those terms may vary from the\nterms described here. 87\n\nAs you read this section, please remember that\nthe specific terms of your unit as described\nin your prospectus supplement will supplement\nand, if applicable, may modify or replace the\ngeneral terms described in this section. If\nthere are differences between your prospectus\nsupplement and this prospectus, your\nprospectus supplement will control. Thus, the\nstatements we make in this section may not\napply to your unit.\n\nWhen we refer to a series of units, we mean\nall units issued as part of\nthe same series under the applicable unit\nagreement. We will identify the series of\nwhich your units are a part in your prospectus\nsupplement. When we refer to your prospectus\nsupplement, we mean the prospectus supplement\ndescribing the specific\nterms of the units you purchase. The terms\nused in your prospectus supplement will have\nthe meanings described in this prospectus,\nunless otherwise specified.\n\nUnit Agreements: Prepaid, Non-Prepaidand Other\n\nWe will issue the units under one or more unit\nagreements to be entered into between us and a\nbank or other financial institution, as unit\nagent. We may\nadd, replace or terminate unit agents from\ntime to time. We may also choose to act as our\nown unit agent, and we may select GS&Co. or\nanother of our affiliates to perform this\nrole. We will identify the unit agreement\nunder which your units will\nbe issued and the unit agent under that\nagreement in your prospectus supplement.\n\nIf a unit includes one or more purchase\ncontracts and all those\npurchase contracts are prepaid purchase\ncontracts, we will issue the unit under a\n\u0093prepaid unit agreement\u0094. Prepaid unit\nagreements will reflect the fact that the\nholders of the related units have no further\nobligations under the purchase\ncontracts included in their units. If a unit\nincludes one or more non-prepaid purchase\ncontracts, we will issue the unit under a\n\u0093non-prepaid unit agreement\u0094. Non-prepaid unit\nagreements will reflect the fact that the\nholders have payment or other obligations\nunder one or more of the purchase contracts\ncomprising their units. We may also issue\nunits under other kinds of\nunit agreements, which we will describe in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. In some\ncases, we may issue units under one of our\nindentures.\n\nA\nunit agreement may also serve as the governing\ndocument for a security included in a unit.\nFor example, a non-prepaid purchase contract\nthat is part of a unit may be issued under and\ngoverned by the relevant\nunit agreement.\n\nIn this prospectus, we refer to prepaid unit\nagreements, non-prepaid unit agreements and\nother unit agreements, generally, as \u0093unit\nagreements\u0094. We will file the unit agreement\nunder which we issue your units with the SEC,\neither as an exhibit to an amendment to the\nregistration statement of which this\nprospectus is a part or\nas an exhibit to a current report on Form 8-K.\nSee \u0093Available Information\u0094 above for\ninformation on how to obtain a copy of a unit\nagreement when it is filed.\n\nGeneral Provisions of a Unit Agreement\n\nThe\nfollowing provisions will generally apply to\nall unit agreements unless otherwise stated in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement.\n\nEnforcement of Rights\n\nThe unit agent under a unit agreement will act\nsolely as our agent in connection with the\nunits issued under that agreement. The unit\nagent\nwill not assume any obligation or relationship\nof agency or trust for or with any holders of\nthose units or of the securities comprising\nthose units. The unit agent will not be\nobligated to take any action on behalf of\nthose holders to enforce or\nprotect their rights under the units or the\nincluded securities.\n\n88\n\nExcept as described in the next paragraph, a\nholder of a unit may, without the consent of\nthe unit agent or any other holder, enforce\nits rights as holder under any security\nincluded in the unit, in accordance with the\nterms of that security and the indenture,\nwarrant agreement, unit agreement or trust\nagreement under which that security is issued.\nThose terms are described elsewhere in this\nprospectus under the sections relating to debt\nsecurities, warrants and purchase contracts.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a unit\nagreement may limit or otherwise affect the\nability of a holder of units issued under that\nagreement to enforce its rights, including any\nright to bring a legal action, with respect to\nthose units or any securities, other than debt\nsecurities, prepaid purchase contracts and\nwarrants issued under the warrant indenture,\nthat are included in those units. Limitations\nof this kind will be described in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. Modification\nWithout Consent of Holders We and the\napplicable unit agent may amend any unit or\nunit agreement without the consent of any\nholder:\n                              \n      to cure any ambiguity;  \n                              \n                                              \n      to correct or supplement any defective  \n      or inconsistent provision; or           \n                                              \n                                              \n      to make any other change that we        \n      believe is necessary or desirable and   \n      will not adversely affect the           \n      interests of the                        \n      affected holders in any material        \n      respect.                                \n                                              \nWe do not need any approval to make changes\nthat affect only units to be issued after the\nchanges take effect. We may also make changes\nthat do not adversely affect a particular unit\nin any material respect, even if they\nadversely affect other units in a material\nrespect. In those cases, we do not need to\nobtain the approval of the holder of the\nunaffected unit; we need only obtain any\nrequired approvals from the holders of the\naffected units. The foregoing applies also to\nany security issued under a unit agreement, as\nthe governing document. Modification With\nConsent of Holders We may not amend any\nparticular unit or a unit agreement with\nrespect to any particular unit unless we\nobtain the consent of the holder of that unit,\nif the amendment would:\n                                              \n      impair any right of the holder to       \n      exercise or enforce any right under a   \n      security included in the unit if the    \n      terms of that                           \n      security require the consent of the     \n      holder to any changes that would        \n      impair the exercise or enforcement of   \n      that right;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      impair the right of the holder to       \n      purchase or sell, as the case may be,   \n      the purchase contract property under    \n      any non-prepaid purchase contract       \n      issued under the unit agreement, or to  \n      require delivery of or payment for      \n      that property when due; or              \n                                              \n                                              \n      reduce the percentage of outstanding    \n      units of any series or class the        \n      consent of whose holders is required    \n      to amend that                           \n      series or class, or the applicable      \n      unit agreement with respect to that     \n      series or class, as described below.    \n                                              \nAny other change to a particular unit\nagreement and the units issued under that\nagreement would require the following\napproval:\n                                              \n      If the change affects only the units    \n      of a particular series issued under     \n      that agreement, the change must be      \n      approved by the                         \n      holders of a majority of the            \n      outstanding units of that series.       \n                                              \n89\n                                              \n      If the change affects the units of      \n      more than one series issued under that  \n      agreement, it must be approved by the   \n      holders of                              \n      a majority of all outstanding units of  \n      all series affected by the change,      \n      with the units of all the affected      \n      series voting together as one class     \n      for this purpose.                       \n                                              \nThese provisions regarding changes with\nmajority approval also apply to changes\naffecting any securities issued under a unit\nagreement, as the governing document. In each\ncase, the required approval must be given by\nwritten consent. Unit Agreements Will Not Be\nQualified Under Trust Indenture Act No unit\nagreement will be qualified as an indenture,\nand no unit agent will be required to qualify\nas a trustee, under the Trust Indenture Act.\nTherefore, holders of units issued under unit\nagreements will not have the protections of\nthe Trust Indenture Act with respect to their\nunits. Additional Provisions of a Non-\nPrepaidUnit Agreement In addition to the\nprovisions described above, a non-prepaidunit\nagreement will include the following\nprovisions. Obligations of Unit Holder Each\nholder of units issued under a non-prepaidunit\nagreement will:\n                                              \n      be bound by the terms of each           \n      non-prepaid purchase contract included  \n      in the                                  \n      holder\u0092s units and by the terms of the   \n      unit agreement with respect to those    \n      contracts; and                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      appoint the unit agent as its           \n      authorized agent to execute, deliver    \n      and perform on the holder\u0092s behalf each  \n      non-prepaid purchase contract included  \n      in the holder\u0092s units.                   \n                                              \nThe unit agreement for a unit that includes a\nnon-prepaidpurchase contract will also include\nprovisions regarding the holder\u0092s pledge of\ncollateral and special settlement provisions.\nThese are described above under \u0093Description\nof Purchase Contracts We May Offer \u0097\nAdditional Terms of Non-PrepaidPurchase\nContracts\u0094. Failure of Holder to Perform\nObligations If the holder fails to settle its\nobligations under a non-prepaidpurchase\ncontract included in a unit as required, the\nholder will not receive the purchase contract\nproperty or other consideration to be\ndelivered at settlement of the purchase\ncontract. Holders that fail to make timely\nsettlement may also be obligated to pay\ninterest or other amounts. Assumption of\nObligations by Transferee When the holder of a\nunit issued under a non-prepaidunit agreement\ntransfers the unit to a new holder, the new\nholder will assume the obligations of the\nprior holder with respect to each non-\nprepaidpurchase contract included in the unit,\nand the prior holder will be released from\nthose obligations. Under the non-prepaidunit\nagreement, we will consent to the transfer of\nthe unit, to the assumption of those\nobligations by the new holder and to the\nrelease of the prior holder, if the transfer\nis made in accordance with the provisions of\nthat agreement. Mergers and Similar\nTransactions Permitted; No Restrictive\nCovenants or Events of Default The unit\nagreements will not restrict our ability to\nmerge or consolidate with, or sell our assets\nto, another corporation or other entity or to\nengage in any other transactions. If at any\ntime we merge or 90\n\nconsolidate with, or sell our assets\nsubstantially as an entirety to, another\ncorporation or other entity, the successor\nentity will succeed to and assume our\nobligations under the unit agreements. We will\nthen be relieved of any further obligation\nunder these agreements. The unit agreements\nwill not include any restrictions on our\nability to put liens on our assets, including\nour interests in our subsidiaries, nor will\nthey restrict our ability to sell our assets.\nThe unit agreements also will not provide for\nany events of default (or covenant breaches)\nor remedies upon the occurrence of any events\nof default (or covenant breaches). Governing\nLaw The unit agreements and the units will be\ngoverned by New York law. Form, Exchange and\nTransfer We will issue each unit in global \u0097\ni.e., book-entry \u0097 form only. Units in book-\nentry form will be represented by a global\nsecurity registered in the name of a\ndepositary, which will be the holder of all\nthe units represented by the global security.\nThose who own beneficial interests in a unit\nwill do so through participants in the\ndepositary\u0092s system, and the rights of these\nindirect owners will be governed solely by the\napplicable procedures of the depositary and\nits participants. We describe book-entry\nsecurities below under \u0093Legal Ownership and\nBook-Entry Issuance\u0094. In addition, we will\nissue each unit in registered form. Each unit\nand all securities comprising the unit will be\nissued in the same form. If we issue any units\nin registered, non-globalform, the following\nwill apply to them. The units will be issued\nin the denominations stated in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. Holders may exchange\ntheir units for units of smaller denominations\nor combined into fewer units of larger\ndenominations, as long as the total amount is\nnot changed.\n                                              \n      Holders may exchange or transfer their  \n      units at the office of the unit agent.  \n      Holders may also replace lost, stolen,  \n      destroyed or mutilated units at that    \n      office. We may appoint another entity   \n      to perform these functions or perform   \n      them ourselves.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      Holders will not be required to pay a   \n      service charge to transfer or exchange  \n      their units, but they may be required   \n      to pay                                  \n      for any tax or other governmental       \n      charge associated with the transfer or  \n      exchange. The transfer or exchange,     \n      and any replacement, will be made only  \n      if our transfer agent is satisfied      \n      with the holder\u0092s proof of legal         \n      ownership. The transfer                 \n      agent may also require an indemnity     \n      before replacing any units.             \n                                              \n                                              \n      If we have the right to redeem,         \n      accelerate or settle any units before   \n      their maturity, and we exercise our     \n      right as to less                        \n      than all those units or other           \n      securities, we may block the exchange   \n      or transfer of those units during the   \n      period beginning 15 days before the     \n      day we mail the notice of exercise and  \n      ending on the day of that mailing, in   \n      order to freeze the list of             \n      holders to prepare the mailing. We may  \n      also refuse to register transfers of    \n      or exchange any unit selected for       \n      early settlement, except that we will   \n      continue to permit transfers and        \n      exchanges of the unsettled portion of   \n      any unit being partially                \n      settled. We may also block the          \n      transfer or exchange of any unit in     \n      this manner if the unit includes        \n      securities that are or may be selected  \n      for early settlement.                   \n                                              \nOnly the depositary will be entitled to\ntransfer or exchange a unit in global form,\nsince it will be the sole holder of the unit.\n91\n\nPayments and Notices\n\nIn making payments and giving notices with\nrespect to our units, we will follow the\nprocedures we plan to use with respect to our\ndebt securities, where\napplicable. We describe those procedures above\nunder \u0093Description of Debt Securities We May\nOffer \u0097 Payment Mechanics for Debt Securities\u0094\nand \u0093Description of Debt Securities We May\nOffer \u0097 Notices\u0094.\n\n92\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK WE MAY OFFER\nPlease note that in this section entitled\n\u0093Description of Preferred Stock We May Offer\u0094,\nreferences to \u0093The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0094,\n\u0093we\u0094, \u0093our\u0094 and \u0093us\u0094 refer only to The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. and not to its consolidated\nsubsidiaries.

We may also\n\u0093reopen\u0094 a previously issued series of\npreferred stock and issue additional preferred\nstock of that series. This section summarizes\nterms of the preferred stock that apply\ngenerally to all series. We describe most of\nthe financial and other specific terms of your\nseries in the applicable prospectus supplement\naccompanying this prospectus. Those terms may\nvary from the terms described here. As you\nread this section, please remember that the\nspecific terms of your series of preferred\nstock and any related depositary shares as\ndescribed in your prospectus supplement will\nsupplement and, if applicable, may modify or\nreplace the general terms described in this\nsection.

Preferred\nStock Issued in Separate Series Our board of\ndirectors is authorized to divide the\npreferred stock into series and, with respect\nto each series, to determine the designations,\nthe powers, preferences and rights and the\nqualifications, limitations and restrictions\nof the series, including:\n                                              \n      dividend rights (which may be           \n      cumulative or non-cumulative);          \n                                              \n93\n                                      \n      conversion or exchange rights;  \n                                      \n                      \n      voting rights;  \n                      \n                                    \n      redemption rights and terms;  \n                                    \n                                \n      liquidation preferences;  \n                                \n                                \n      sinking fund provisions;  \n                                \n                                              \n      the serial designation of the series;   \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      the number of shares constituting the   \n      series.                                 \n                                              \nSubject to the rights of the holders of any\nseries of preferred stock, the number of\nauthorized shares of any series of preferred\nstock may be increased or decreased, but not\nbelow the number of shares of that series then\noutstanding, by resolution adopted by our\nboard of directors and approved by the\naffirmative vote of the holders of a majority\nof the voting power of all outstanding shares\nof capital stock entitled to vote on the\nmatter, voting together as a single class. No\nseparate vote of the holders of any series of\npreferred stock is required for an increase or\ndecrease in the number of authorized shares of\nthat series. Before we issue any series of\npreferred stock, our board of directors, or a\ncommittee of our board authorized to do so by\nour board, will adopt resolutions creating and\ndesignating the series and will file a\ncertificate of designations stating the terms\nof the series with the Secretary of State of\nthe State of Delaware. None of our\nstockholders will need to approve that\namendment. In addition, as described below\nunder \u0093\u0097 Fractional or Multiple Shares of\nPreferred Stock Issued as Depositary Shares\u0094,\nwe may, at our option, instead of offering\nwhole individual shares of any series of\npreferred stock, offer depositary shares\nevidenced by depositary receipts, each\nrepresenting a fraction of a share or some\nmultiple of shares of the particular series of\npreferred stock issued and deposited with a\ndepositary. The fraction of a share or\nmultiple of shares of preferred stock which\neach depositary share represents will be\nstated in the prospectus supplement relating\nto any series of preferred stock offered\nthrough depositary shares. The rights of\nholders of preferred stock may be adversely\naffected by the rights of holders of preferred\nstock that may be issued in the future. Our\nboard of directors may cause shares of\npreferred stock to be issued in public or\nprivate transactions for any proper corporate\npurpose. Examples of proper corporate purposes\ninclude issuances to obtain additional\nfinancing for acquisitions and issuances to\nofficers, directors and employees under their\nrespective benefit plans. Shares of preferred\nstock we issue may have the effect of\ndiscouraging or making more difficult an\nacquisition of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nWe may choose to issue preferred stock,\ntogether with our other securities described\nin this prospectus, in units. Under existing\ninterpretations of the Federal Reserve Board,\nif the holders of the preferred stock become\nentitled to vote for the election of directors\nbecause dividends on the preferred stock are\nin arrears, the preferred stock may then be\ndeemed a \u0093class of voting securities\u0094 and a\nholder of 25% or more of the preferred stock\nor a holder of 5% or more of the preferred\nstock that is otherwise a bank holding company\nmay then be regulated as a \u0093bank holding\ncompany\u0094 with respect to The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. in accordance with the U.S. Bank\nHolding Company Act of 1956 (the \u0093Bank Holding\nCompany Act\u0094). In addition, at such time:\n                                              \n      any bank holding company or foreign     \n      bank with a U.S. presence generally     \n      would be required to obtain the         \n      approval of the                         \n      Federal Reserve Board under the Bank    \n      Holding Company Act to acquire or       \n      retain 5% or more of the preferred      \n      stock; and                              \n                                              \n94\n                                              \n      any person other than a bank holding    \n      company may be required to obtain the   \n      approval of the Federal Reserve Board   \n      under the                               \n      U.S. Change in Bank Control Act of      \n      1978 to acquire or retain 10% or more   \n      of the preferred stock.                 \n                                              \nThe right of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. to\nredeem any of the preferred stock is subject\nto any limitations established by the Federal\nReserve Board. Currently, The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. may not redeem preferred stock\nwithout having received the prior approval of\nthe Federal Reserve Board under the capital\nrules applicable to it. The factors the\nFederal Reserve Board currently considers in\nevaluating a proposed redemption by a bank\nholding company include, among other things,\nthe capital plans and stress tests submitted\nby the bank holding company, the bank holding\ncompany\u0092s ability to meet and exceed minimum\nregulatory capital ratios under stressed\nscenarios, its expected sources and uses of\ncapital over the planning horizon (generally a\nperiod of two years) under baseline and\nstressed scenarios, and any potential impact\nof changes to its business plan and activities\non its capital adequacy and liquidity,\nalthough the Federal Reserve Board may change\nthese factors at any time. Preferred stock\nwill be fully paid and non-assessablewhen\nissued, which means that its holders will have\npaid their purchase price in full and that we\nmay not ask them to surrender additional\nfunds. Holders of preferred stock will not\nhave preemptive or subscription rights to\nacquire more stock of The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. The transfer agent, registrar, dividend\ndisbursing agent, calculation agent (if any)\nand redemption agent for shares of each series\nof preferred stock will be named in the\nprospectus supplement relating to that series,\nand The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. may replace\nany or all of such agents and the registrar at\nany time without consent of the holders of\npreferred stock. Rank Shares of each series of\npreferred stock will rank equally with each\nother series of preferred stock and senior to\nour common stock with respect to dividends and\ndistributions of assets. In addition, we will\ngenerally be able to pay dividends and\ndistributions of assets to holders of our\npreferred stock only if we have satisfied our\nobligations on our indebtedness then due and\npayable. Dividends Holders of each series of\npreferred stock will be entitled to receive\ncash dividends when, as and if declared by our\nboard of directors, from funds legally\navailable for the payment of dividends. The\nrates and dates of payment of dividends for\neach series of preferred stock will be stated\nin the applicable prospectus supplement.\nDividends will be payable to holders of record\nof preferred stock as they appear on our books\non the record dates fixed by our board of\ndirectors. Dividends on any series of\npreferred stock may be cumulative or\nnoncumulative, as set forth in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. Redemption If specified\nin an applicable prospectus supplement, a\nseries of preferred stock may be redeemable at\nany time, in whole or in part, at our option\nor the holder\u0092s, and may be redeemed\nmandatorily. Any restriction on the repurchase\nor redemption by us of our preferred stock,\nincluding while there is an arrearage in the\npayment of dividends, will be described in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. Any partial\nredemptions of our preferred stock will be\nmade in a way that our board of directors\ndecides is equitable. 95\n\nUnless we default in the payment of the\nredemption price, dividends will cease to\naccrue after the redemption date on shares of\nour preferred stock called for redemption and\nall rights of holders of these shares will\nterminate except for the right to receive the\nredemption price. Conversion or Exchange\nRights The prospectus supplement relating to\nany series of preferred stock that is\nconvertible, exercisable or exchangeable will\nstate the terms on which shares of that series\nare convertible into or exercisable or\nexchangeable for shares of common stock,\nanother series of preferred stock or other\nsecurities of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. or\ndebt or equity securities of third parties.\nLiquidation Preference Upon any voluntary or\ninvoluntary liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding up of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.,\nholders of each series of preferred stock will\nbe entitled to receive distributions upon\nliquidation in the amount described in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, plus an\namount equal to any accrued and unpaid\ndividends. These distributions will be made\nbefore any distribution is made on any\nsecurities ranking junior to the preferred\nstock with respect to liquidation, including\nour common stock. If the liquidation amounts\npayable relating to the preferred stock of any\nseries and any other securities ranking on a\nparity regarding liquidation rights are not\npaid in full, the holders of the preferred\nstock of that series and the other securities\nwill share in any distribution of our\navailable assets on a ratable basis in\nproportion to the full liquidation preferences\n(which includes declared and unpaid dividends\nin the case of non-cumulativestock and unpaid,\naccrued, cumulative dividends, whether or not\ndeclared, in the case of cumulative stock) of\neach security. Holders of our preferred stock\nwill not be entitled to any other amounts from\nus after they have received their full\nliquidation preference. Voting Rights The\nholders of preferred stock of each series will\nhave no voting rights, except:\n                                              \n      as stated in the applicable prospectus  \n      supplement and in the certificate of    \n      designations establishing the series;   \n      or                                      \n                                              \n                                      \n      as required by applicable law.  \n                                      \nMergers and Similar Transactions Permitted; No\nRestrictive Covenants The terms of the\npreferred stock will not include any\nrestrictions on our ability to merge or\nconsolidate with, or sell our assets to,\nanother corporation or other entity or to\nengage in any other transactions. The terms of\nthe preferred stock also will not include any\nrestrictions on our ability to put liens on\nour assets, including our interests in our\nsubsidiaries. Because we are a holding\ncompany, our ability to make payments on the\npreferred stock will depend in part on our\nability to participate in distributions of\nassets from our subsidiaries. We discuss these\nmatters above under \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities We May Offer \u0097 We Are a Holding\nCompany\u0094. Governing Law The preferred stock\nwill be governed by Delaware law. Fractional\nor Multiple Shares of Preferred Stock Issued\nas Depositary Shares We may choose to offer\nfractional shares or some multiple of shares\nof our preferred stock, rather than whole\nindividual shares. If we decide to do so, we\nwill issue the preferred stock in the form of\n96\n\ndepositary shares. Each depositary share would\nrepresent a fraction or multiple of a share of\nthe preferred stock and would be evidenced by\na depositary receipt. We will issue depositary\nshares under a deposit agreement between a\ndepositary, which we will appoint in our\ndiscretion, and us. Deposit Agreement We will\ndeposit the shares of preferred stock to be\nrepresented by depositary shares under a\ndeposit agreement. The parties to the deposit\nagreement will be:\n                                      \n      The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.;  \n                                      \n                                              \n      a bank or other financial institution   \n      selected by us and named in the         \n      applicable prospectus supplement, as    \n      preferred stock                         \n      depositary; and                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      the holders from time to time of        \n      depositary receipts issued under that   \n      depositary agreement.                   \n                                              \nEach holder of a depositary share will be\nentitled to all the rights and preferences of\nthe underlying preferred stock, including,\nwhere applicable, dividend, voting,\nredemption, conversion and liquidation rights,\nin proportion to the applicable fraction or\nmultiple of a share of preferred stock\nrepresented by the depositary share. The\ndepositary shares will be evidenced by\ndepositary receipts issued under the deposit\nagreement. The depositary receipts will be\ndistributed to those persons purchasing the\nfractional or multiple shares of preferred\nstock. A depositary receipt may evidence any\nnumber of whole depositary shares. For each\nseries of outstanding preferred stock, we have\nfiled a deposit agreement, including the form\nof depositary receipt and a related letter\nagreement, with the SEC either as an exhibit\nto the relevant registration statement on Form\n8-Aor Form S-3,and in the future we may file\nadditional deposit agreements, including the\nform of depository receipt, with the SEC,\neither as an exhibit to an amendment to the\nregistration statement of which this\nprospectus forms a part or as an exhibit to a\nregistration statement on Form 8-A.See\n\u0093Available Information\u0094 above for information\non how to obtain copies of documents filed by\nus with the SEC. Dividends and Other\nDistributions The preferred stock depositary\nwill distribute any cash dividends or other\ncash distributions received in respect of the\ndeposited preferred stock to the record\nholders of depositary shares relating to the\nunderlying preferred stock in proportion to\nthe number of depositary shares owned by the\nholders. The preferred stock depositary will\ndistribute any property received by it other\nthan cash to the record holders of depositary\nshares entitled to those distributions, unless\nit determines that the distribution cannot be\nmade proportionally among those holders or\nthat it is not feasible to make a\ndistribution. In that event, the preferred\nstock depositary may, with our approval, sell\nthe property and distribute the net proceeds\nfrom the sale to the holders of the depositary\nshares in proportion to the number of\ndepositary shares they own. The amounts\ndistributed to holders of depositary shares\nwill be reduced by any amounts required to be\nwithheld by the preferred stock depositary or\nby us on account of taxes or other\ngovernmental charges. Redemption of Preferred\nStock If we redeem preferred stock represented\nby depositary shares, the preferred stock\ndepositary will redeem the depositary shares\nfrom the proceeds it receives from the\nredemption, in whole or in part, of the\npreferred stock. The preferred stock\ndepositary will redeem the depositary shares\nat a price per 97\n\nshare equal to the applicable fraction or\nmultiple of the redemption price per share of\npreferred stock. Whenever we redeem shares of\npreferred stock held by the preferred stock\ndepositary, the\npreferred stock depositary will redeem as of\nthe same date the number of depositary shares\nrepresenting the redeemed shares of preferred\nstock. If fewer than all the depositary shares\nare to be redeemed, the preferred stock\ndepositary will select\nthe depositary shares to be redeemed by lot or\nratably.\n\nAfter the date fixed for redemption, the\ndepositary shares called for redemption will\nno\nlonger be deemed to be outstanding, and all\nrights of the holders of those shares will\ncease, except the right to receive the amount\npayable and any other property to which the\nholders were entitled upon the redemption. To\nreceive this amount or\nother property, the holders must surrender the\ndepositary receipts evidencing their\ndepositary shares to the preferred stock\ndepositary. Any funds that we deposit with the\npreferred stock depositary for any depositary\nshares that the holders fail to\nredeem will be returned to us after a period\nof two years from the date we deposit the\nfunds.\n\nWithdrawal of Preferred Stock\n\nUnless the related depositary shares have\npreviously been called for redemption, if the\ndepositary shares are not issued in book-entry\nform, then any\nregistered holder of depositary shares may\nreceive the number of whole shares of the\nrelated series of preferred stock and any\nmoney or other property represented by those\ndepositary receipts after surrendering the\ndepositary receipts at the\ncorporate trust office of the preferred stock\ndepositary, paying any taxes, charges and fees\nprovided for in the deposit agreement and\ncomplying with any other requirement of the\ndeposit agreement. If the depositary shares\nare issued in book-entry\nform, only the single registered holder can\nmake such a withdrawal. Holders of depositary\nshares making these withdrawals will be\nentitled to receive whole shares of preferred\nstock, but holders of whole shares of\npreferred stock will not be\nentitled to deposit that preferred stock under\nthe deposit agreement or to receive depositary\nreceipts for that preferred stock after\nwithdrawal. If the depositary shares\nsurrendered by the holder in connection with\nwithdrawal exceed the number of\ndepositary shares that represent the number of\nwhole shares of preferred stock to be\nwithdrawn, the preferred stock depositary will\ndeliver to that holder at the same time a new\ndepositary receipt evidencing the excess\nnumber of depositary shares.\n\nVoting Deposited Preferred Stock\n\nWhen the\npreferred stock depositary receives notice of\nany meeting at which the holders of any series\nof deposited preferred stock are entitled to\nvote, the preferred stock depositary will mail\nthe information contained in the notice to the\nrecord holders of\nthe depositary shares relating to the\napplicable series of preferred stock. Each\nrecord holder of the depositary shares on the\nrecord date, which will be the same date as\nthe record date for the preferred stock, may\ninstruct the preferred stock\ndepositary to vote the amount of the preferred\nstock represented by the holder\u0092s depositary\nshares. To the extent possible, the preferred\nstock depositary will vote the amount of the\nseries of preferred stock represented by\ndepositary shares in\naccordance with the instructions it receives.\nWe will agree to take all reasonable actions\nthat the preferred stock depositary determines\nare necessary to enable the preferred stock\ndepositary to vote as instructed. If the\npreferred stock depositary\ndoes not receive specific instructions from\nthe holders of any depositary shares\nrepresenting a series of preferred stock, it\nwill vote all shares of that series held by it\nproportionately with instructions received.\n\nConversion of Preferred Stock\n\nIf the prospectus\nsupplement relating to the depositary shares\nsays that the deposited preferred stock is\nconvertible into or exercisable or\nexchangeable for common stock, preferred stock\nof another series or other securities of The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. or debt\nor equity securities of one or more third\nparties, the following will apply. The\ndepositary shares, as such, will not be\nconvertible into or\n\n98\n\nexercisable or exchangeable for any securities\nof The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. or any third\nparty. Rather, any holder of the depositary\nshares may surrender the related depositary\nreceipts to the preferred stock depositary\nwith written instructions to instruct us to\ncause conversion, exercise or exchange of the\npreferred stock represented by the depositary\nshares into or for whole shares of common\nstock, shares of another series of preferred\nstock or other securities of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. or debt or equity securities of\nthe relevant third party, as applicable. Upon\nreceipt of those instructions and any amounts\npayable by the holder in connection with the\nconversion, exercise or exchange, we will\ncause the conversion, exercise or exchange\nusing the same procedures as those provided\nfor conversion, exercise or exchange of the\ndeposited preferred stock. If only some of the\ndepositary shares are to be converted,\nexercised or exchanged, a new depositary\nreceipt or receipts will be issued for any\ndepositary shares not to be converted,\nexercised or exchanged. Amendment and\nTermination of the Deposit Agreement We may\namend the form of depositary receipt\nevidencing the depositary shares and any\nprovision of the deposit agreement at any time\nand from time to time by agreement with the\npreferred stock depositary. However, any\namendment that imposes additional charges or\nmaterially and adversely alters any\nsubstantial existing right of the holders of\ndepositary shares will not be effective unless\nthe holders of at least a majority of the\naffected depositary shares then outstanding\napprove the amendment. We will make no\namendment that impairs the right of any holder\nof depositary shares, as described above under\n\u0093\u0097 Withdrawal of Preferred Stock\u0094, to receive\nshares of the related series of preferred\nstock and any money or other property\nrepresented by those depositary shares, except\nin order to comply with mandatory provisions\nof applicable law. Holders who retain or\nacquire their depositary receipts after an\namendment becomes effective will be deemed to\nhave agreed to the amendment and will be bound\nby the amended deposit agreement. The deposit\nagreement will automatically terminate if:\n                                              \n      all outstanding depositary shares have  \n      been redeemed or converted or           \n      exchanged for any other securities      \n      into which they or                      \n      the underlying preferred stock are      \n      convertible or exchangeable; or         \n                                              \n                                              \n      a final distribution in respect of the  \n      preferred stock has been made to the    \n      holders of depositary shares in         \n      connection with                         \n      any liquidation, dissolution or         \n      winding up of The Goldman Sachs Group,  \n      Inc.                                    \n                                              \nWe may terminate the deposit agreement at any\ntime, and the preferred stock depositary will\ngive notice of that termination to the\nregistered holders of all outstanding\ndepositary receipts not less than 30 days\nbefore the termination date. In that event,\nthe preferred stock depositary will deliver or\nmake available for delivery to registered\nholders of depositary shares, upon surrender\nof the depositary receipts evidencing the\ndepositary shares, the number of whole or\nfractional shares of the related series of\npreferred stock as are represented by those\ndepositary shares. Charges of Preferred Stock\nDepositary; Taxes and Other Governmental\nCharges We will pay the fees, charges and\nexpenses of the preferred stock depositary\nprovided in the deposit agreement to be\npayable by us. Holders of depositary receipts\nwill pay any taxes and governmental charges\nand any charges provided in the deposit\nagreement to be payable by them, including a\nfee for the withdrawal of shares of preferred\nstock upon surrender of depositary receipts.\nIf the preferred stock depositary incurs fees,\ncharges or expenses for which it is not\notherwise liable at the election of a holder\nof a depositary receipt or other person, that\nholder or other person will be liable for\nthose fees, charges and expenses. 99\n\nResignation and Removal of Depositary\n\nThe preferred stock depositary may resign at\nany time by giving us notice, and we may\nremove or replace the preferred stock\ndepositary at any time.\n\nReports to Holders\n\nWe will deliver all required\nreports and communications to holders of the\npreferred stock to the preferred stock\ndepositary. It will forward those reports and\ncommunications to the holders of depositary\nshares.\n\nLimitation on Liability of the Preferred Stock\nDepositary\n\nThe preferred stock depositary will not be\nliable if it is prevented or delayed by law or\nany circumstances beyond its control in\nperforming its\nobligations under the deposit agreement. The\nobligations of the preferred stock depositary\nunder the deposit agreement will be limited to\nperformance in good faith of its duties under\nthe agreement, and it will not be obligated to\nprosecute or\ndefend any legal proceeding in respect of any\ndepositary shares, depositary receipts or\nshares of preferred stock unless satisfactory\nand reasonable protection from expenses and\nliability is furnished. This is called an\nindemnity.

These provisions\ninclude: Constituency Provision In accordance\nwith our charter, a director of The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. may (but is not required to)\nin taking any action (including an action that\nmay involve or relate to a change or potential\nchange in control of The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc.), consider, among other things, the\neffects that The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s\nactions may have on other interests or persons\n(including its employees, former partners of\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. and the\ncommunity) in addition to our shareholders.\nAdvance Notice Requirements Our by-\nlawsestablish advance notice procedures with\nregard to shareholder proposals relating to\nthe nomination of candidates for election as\ndirectors or new business to be brought before\nmeetings of shareholders of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. These procedures provide that\nnotice of such shareholder proposals must be\ntimely given in writing to the Secretary of\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. prior to the\nmeeting at which the action is to be taken.\nThe time periods vary depending on the nature\nof the proposal. The notice must contain\ncertain information specified in the by-\nlawsand must otherwise comply with the by-\nlaws. Limitation on Ability of Shareholders to\nCall Special Meetings Our charter and by-\nlawsprovide procedures pursuant to which\nholders of record of not less than 25% of the\nvoting power of outstanding shares of our\ncommon stock may call a special meeting of\nshareholders. Our by-lawsimpose certain\nprocedural requirements on shareholders\nrequesting such a meeting (including the\nprovision of the same information required for\nshareholder proposals at annual meetings under\nour advance notice by-lawprovisions described\nabove), as well as qualifications designed to\nprevent duplicative and unnecessary meetings.\nNo Written Consent of Shareholders Our charter\nrequires all shareholder actions to be taken\nby a vote of the shareholders at an annual or\nspecial meeting, and does not permit our\nshareholders to act by written consent without\na meeting. Blank Check Preferred Stock Our\ncharter provides for 150,000,000 authorized\nshares of preferred stock. The existence of\nauthorized but unissued shares of preferred\nstock may enable the board of directors to\nrender more 104\n\ndifficult or to discourage an attempt to\nobtain control of Goldman Sachs by means of a\nmerger, tender offer, proxy contest or\notherwise. For example, if in the due exercise\nof its fiduciary\nobligations, the board of directors were to\ndetermine that a takeover proposal is not in\nthe best interests of Goldman Sachs, the board\nof directors could cause shares of preferred\nstock to be issued without shareholder\napproval in one or more\nprivate offerings or other transactions that\nmight dilute the voting or other rights of the\nproposed acquiror or insurgent shareholder or\nshareholder group. In this regard, the charter\ngrants our board of directors broad power to\nestablish the\nrights and preferences of authorized and\nunissued shares of preferred stock. The\nissuance of shares of preferred stock could\ndecrease the amount of earnings and assets\navailable for distribution to holders of\nshares of common stock. The issuance may\nalso adversely affect the rights and powers,\nincluding voting rights, of such holders and\nmay have the effect of delaying, deterring or\npreventing a change in control of Goldman\nSachs.\n\nListing\n\nThe common stock of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. is listed on the NYSE under the\nticker symbol \u0093GS\u0094.\n\nTransfer Agent\n\nThe transfer agent for the common stock is\nComputershare.\n\n105\n\nLEGAL OWNERSHIP AND BOOK-ENTRY ISSUANCE\n\nIn this section, we describe special\nconsiderations that will apply to registered\nsecurities issued in global \u0097 i.e., book-entry\n\u0097\nform. First we describe the difference between\nlegal ownership and indirect ownership of\nregistered securities. Then we describe\nspecial provisions that apply to global\nsecurities.\n\nWho Is the Legal Owner of a Registered\nSecurity?\n\nEach debt security, warrant, purchase\ncontract, unit, share of preferred stock and\ndepositary share in registered form will be\nrepresented either by a\ncertificate issued in definitive form to a\nparticular investor or by one or more global\nsecurities representing the entire issuance of\nsecurities. We refer to those who have\nsecurities registered in their own names, on\nthe books that we or the\ntrustee, warrant agent or other agent maintain\nfor this purpose, as the \u0093holders\u0094 of those\nsecurities. These persons are the legal\nholders of the securities. We refer to those\nwho, indirectly through others, own beneficial\ninterests in\nsecurities that are not registered in their\nown names as indirect owners of those\nsecurities. As we discuss below, indirect\nowners are not legal holders, and investors in\nsecurities issued in book-entry form or in\nstreet name will be indirect\nowners.\n\nBook-Entry Owners\n\nWe will issue each\nsecurity in book-entry form only. This means\nsecurities will be represented by one or more\nglobal securities registered in the name of a\nfinancial institution that holds them as\ndepositary on behalf of other financial\ninstitutions that participate\nin the depositary\u0092s book-entry system. These\nparticipating institutions, in turn, hold\nbeneficial interests in the securities on\nbehalf of themselves or their customers.\n\nUnder each indenture, only the person in whose\nname a security is registered is recognized as\nthe holder of that security. Consequently, for\nsecurities\nissued in global form, we will recognize only\nthe depositary as the holder of the securities\nand we will make all payments on the\nsecurities, including deliveries of any\nproperty other than cash, to the depositary.\nThe depositary passes along the\npayments it receives to its participants,\nwhich in turn pass the payments along to their\ncustomers who are the beneficial owners. The\ndepositary and its participants do so under\nagreements they have made with one another or\nwith their customers;\nthey are not obligated to do so under the\nterms of the securities.\n\nAs a result, investors will not own securities\ndirectly. Instead, they will own\nbeneficial interests in a global security,\nthrough a bank, broker or other financial\ninstitution that participates in the\ndepositary\u0092s book-entry system or holds an\ninterest through a participant. As long as the\nsecurities are issued in global\nform, investors will be indirect owners, and\nnot holders, of the securities.\n\nStreet Name Owners\n\nIn the future we may terminate a global\nsecurity or issue securities initially in non-\nglobal form. In these\ncases, investors may choose to hold their\nsecurities in their own names or in street\nname. Securities held by an investor in street\nname would be registered in the name of a\nbank, broker or other financial institution\nthat the investor chooses, and\nthe investor would hold only a beneficial\ninterest in those securities through an\naccount he or she maintains at that\ninstitution.\n\nFor securities\nheld in street name, we will recognize only\nthe intermediary banks, brokers and other\nfinancial institutions in whose names the\nsecurities are registered as the holders of\nthose securities and we will make all payments\non those securities, including\ndeliveries of any property other than cash, to\nthem. These institutions pass along the\npayments they receive to their customers who\n\n106\n\nare the beneficial owners, but only because\nthey agree to do so in their customer\nagreements or because they are legally\nrequired to do so. Investors who hold\nsecurities in street name will be indirect\nowners, not holders, of those securities.\nLegal Holders Our obligations and the\nobligations of the trustee under any indenture\nand the obligations, if any, of any warrant\nagents and unit agents and any other third\nparties employed by us, the trustee or any of\nthose agents, run only to the holders of the\nsecurities. We do not have obligations to\ninvestors who hold beneficial interests in\nglobal securities, in street name or by any\nother indirect means. This will be the case\nwhether an investor chooses to be an indirect\nowner of a security or has no choice because\nwe are issuing the securities only in global\nform. For example, once we make a payment or\ngive a notice to the holder, we have no\nfurther responsibility for that payment or\nnotice even if that holder is required, under\nagreements with depositary participants or\ncustomers or by law, to pass it along to the\nindirect owners but does not do so. Similarly,\nif we want to obtain the approval of the\nholders for any purpose \u0097 e.g., to amend the\nindenture for a series of debt securities or\nwarrants or the warrant agreement for a series\nof warrants or to relieve us of the\nconsequences of a default or of our obligation\nto comply with a particular provision of an\nindenture \u0097 we would seek the approval only\nfrom the holders, and not the indirect owners,\nof the relevant securities. Whether and how\nthe holders contact the indirect owners is up\nto the holders. When we refer to \u0093you\u0094 in this\nprospectus, we mean those who invest in the\nsecurities being offered by this prospectus,\nwhether they are the holders or only indirect\nowners of those securities. When we refer to\n\u0093your securities\u0094 in this prospectus, we mean\nthe securities in which you will hold a direct\nor indirect interest. Special Considerations\nfor Indirect Owners If you hold securities\nthrough a bank, broker or other financial\ninstitution, either in book-entry form or in\nstreet name, you should check with your own\ninstitution to find out:\n                                              \n      how it handles securities payments and  \n      notices;                                \n                                              \n                                           \n      whether it imposes fees or charges;  \n                                           \n                                              \n      whether and how you can instruct it to  \n      exercise any rights to purchase or      \n      sell warrant property under a warrant   \n      or purchase                             \n      contract property under a purchase      \n      contract or to exchange or convert a    \n      security for or into other property;    \n                                              \n                                              \n      how it would handle a request for the   \n      holders\u0092 consent, if ever required;      \n                                              \n                                              \n      whether and how you can instruct it to  \n      send you securities registered in your  \n      own name so you can be a holder, if     \n      that is                                 \n      permitted in the future;                \n                                              \n                                              \n      how it would exercise rights under the  \n      securities if there were a default or   \n      other event triggering the need for     \n      holders to                              \n      act to protect their interests; and     \n                                              \n                                              \n      if the securities are in book-entry     \n      form, how the depositary\u0092s rules and     \n      procedures will affect these matters.   \n                                              \nWhat Is a Global Security? We will issue each\nsecurity in book-entry form only. Each\nsecurity issued in book-entry form will be\nrepresented by a global security that we\ndeposit with and register in the name of one\nor more financial 107\n\ninstitutions or clearing systems, or their\nnominees, which we select. A financial\ninstitution or clearing system that we select\nfor any security for this purpose is called\nthe \u0093depositary\u0094 for that security. A security\nwill usually have only one depositary but it\nmay have more. Each series of securities will\nhave one or more of the following as the\ndepositaries:\n                                              \n      The Depository Trust Company, New       \n      York, New York, which is known as \u0093DTC\u0094;  \n                                              \n                                              \n      a financial institution holding the     \n      securities on behalf of Euroclear Bank  \n      SA/NV, which is known as \u0093Euroclear\u0094;     \n                                              \n                                              \n      a financial institution holding the     \n      securities on behalf of Clearstream     \n      Banking, soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme,               \n      which is known as \u0093Clearstream\u0094; and      \n                                              \n                                              \n      any other clearing system or financial  \n      institution named in the applicable     \n      prospectus supplement.                  \n                                              \nThe depositaries named above may also be\nparticipants in one another\u0092s clearing\nsystems. Thus, for example, if DTC is the\ndepositary for a global security, investors\nmay hold beneficial interests in that security\nthrough Euroclear or Clearstream, as DTC\nparticipants. The depositary or depositaries\nfor your securities will be named in your\nprospectus supplement; if none is named, the\ndepositary will be DTC. A global security may\nrepresent one or any other number of\nindividual securities. Generally, all\nsecurities represented by the same global\nsecurity will have the same terms. We may,\nhowever, issue a global security that\nrepresents multiple securities of the same\nkind, such as debt securities, that have\ndifferent terms and are issued at different\ntimes. We call this kind of global security a\nmaster global security. Your prospectus\nsupplement will not indicate whether your\nsecurities are represented by a master global\nsecurity. A global security may not be\ntransferred to or registered in the name of\nanyone other than the depositary or its\nnominee, unless special termination situations\narise. We describe those situations below\nunder \u0093\u0097 Holder\u0092s Option to Obtain a Non-\nGlobalSecurity; Special Situations When a\nGlobal Security Will Be Terminated\u0094. If\ntermination occurs, we may issue the\nsecurities through another book-entry clearing\nsystem or decide that the securities may no\nlonger be held through any book-entry clearing\nsystem. The depositary, or its nominee, will\nbe the sole registered owner and holder of all\nsecurities represented by a global security,\nand investors will be permitted to own only\nindirect interests in a global security.\nIndirect interests must be held by means of an\naccount with a broker, bank or other financial\ninstitution that in turn has an account with\nthe depositary or with another institution\nthat does. Thus, an investor whose security is\nrepresented by a global security will not be a\nholder of the security, but only an indirect\nowner of an interest in the global security.\nSpecial Considerations for Global Securities\nAs an indirect owner, an investor\u0092s rights\nrelating to a global security will be governed\nby the account rules of the depositary and\nthose of the investor\u0092s financial institution\nor other intermediary through which it holds\nits interest ( e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream,\nif DTC is the depositary), as well as general\nlaws relating to securities transfers. We do\nnot recognize this type of investor or any\nintermediary as a holder of securities and\ninstead deal only with the depositary that\nholds the global security. 108\n\nIf securities are issued only in the form of a\nglobal security, an investor should be aware\nof the following:\n                                              \n      An investor cannot cause the            \n      securities to be registered in his or   \n      her own name, and cannot obtain         \n      non-global certificates for his or her  \n      interest in the securities, except in   \n      the special situations we describe      \n      below;                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      An investor will be an indirect holder  \n      and must look to his or her own bank    \n      or broker for payments on the           \n      securities and                          \n      protection of his or her legal rights   \n      relating to the securities, as we       \n      describe above under \u0093\u0097 Who Is the Legal  \n      Owner of a Registered Security?\u0094;        \n                                              \n                                              \n      An investor may not be able to sell     \n      interests in the securities to some     \n      insurance companies and other           \n      institutions that are                   \n      required by law to own their            \n      securities in non-book-entry form;      \n                                              \n                                              \n      An investor may not be able to pledge   \n      his or her interest in a global         \n      security in circumstances where         \n      certificates                            \n      representing the securities must be     \n      delivered to the lender or other        \n      beneficiary of the pledge in order for  \n      the pledge to be effective;             \n                                              \n                                              \n      The depositary\u0092s policies will govern    \n      payments, deliveries, transfers,        \n      exchanges, notices and other matters    \n      relating                                \n      to an investor\u0092s interest in a global    \n      security, and those policies may        \n      change from time to time. We, the       \n      trustee and any warrant agents and      \n      unit agents will have no                \n      responsibility for any aspect of the    \n      depositary\u0092s policies, actions or        \n      records of ownership interests in a     \n      global security.

There may be more than one         \n      financial intermediary in the chain of  \n      ownership for an investor. We do not    \n      monitor and are not responsible for     \n      the policies or actions or records of   \n      ownership interests of any of those     \n      intermediaries.                         \n                                              \nHolder\u0092s Option to Obtain a Non-\nGlobalSecurity; Special Situations When a\nGlobal Security Will Be Terminated If we issue\nany series of securities in book-entry form\nbut we choose to give the beneficial owners of\nthat series the right to obtain non-\nglobalsecurities, any beneficial owner\nentitled to obtain non-globalsecurities may do\nso by following the applicable procedures of\nthe depositary, any transfer agent or\nregistrar for that series and that owner\u0092s\nbank, broker or other financial institution\nthrough which that owner holds its beneficial\ninterest in the securities. For example, in\nthe case of a global security representing\npreferred stock or depositary shares, a\nbeneficial owner will be entitled to obtain a\nnon-globalsecurity representing its interest\nby making a written request to the transfer\nagent or other agent designated by us. If you\nare entitled to request a non-\nglobalcertificate and wish to do so, you will\nneed to allow sufficient lead time to enable\nus or our agent to prepare the requested\ncertificate. In addition, in a few special\nsituations described below, a global security\nwill be terminated and interests in it will be\nexchanged for certificates in non-globalform\nrepresenting the securities it 109\n\nrepresented. After that exchange, the choice\nof whether to hold the securities directly or\nin street name will be up to the investor.\nInvestors must consult their own banks or\nbrokers to find out how to have their\ninterests in a global security transferred on\ntermination to their own names, so that they\nwill be holders. We have described the rights\nof holders and street name investors above\nunder \u0093\u0097 Who Is the Legal Owner of a\nRegistered Security?\u0094. The special situations\nfor termination of a global security are as\nfollows:\n                                              \n      if the depositary notifies us that it   \n      is unwilling, unable or no longer       \n      qualified to continue as depositary     \n      for that global                         \n      security and we do not appoint another  \n      institution to act as depositary        \n      within 60 days;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      if we notify the trustee, warrant       \n      agent or unit agent, as applicable,     \n      that we wish to terminate that global   \n      security; or                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      in the case of a global security        \n      representing debt securities or         \n      warrants issued under an indenture, if  \n      an event of default                     \n      or covenant breach has occurred with    \n      regard to these debt securities and     \n      has not been cured or waived.           \n                                              \nDTC\u0092s current rules provide that it would\nnotify its participants of a request by us to\nterminate a global security, but will only\nwithdraw beneficial interests from the global\nsecurity at the request of each DTC\nparticipant. If a global security is\nterminated, only the depositary, and not we,\nthe trustee for any debt securities, the\nwarrant agent for any warrants or the unit\nagent for any units, is responsible for\ndeciding the names of the institutions in\nwhose names the securities represented by the\nglobal security will be registered and,\ntherefore, who will be the holders of those\nsecurities. Considerations Relating to\nEuroclear and Clearstream Euroclear and\nClearstream are securities clearing systems in\nEurope. Both systems clear and settle\nsecurities transactions between their\nparticipants through electronic, book-entry\ndelivery of securities against payment.\nEuroclear and Clearstream may be depositaries\nfor a global security. In addition, if DTC is\nthe depositary for a global security,\nEuroclear and Clearstream may hold interests\nin the global security as participants in DTC.\nAs long as any global security is held by\nEuroclear or Clearstream, as depositary, you\nmay hold an interest in the global security\nonly through an organization that\nparticipates, directly or indirectly, in\nEuroclear or Clearstream. If Euroclear or\nClearstream is the depositary for a global\nsecurity and there is no depositary in the\nUnited States, you will not be able to hold\ninterests in that global security through any\nsecurities clearance system in the United\nStates. Payments, deliveries, transfers,\nexchanges, notices and other matters relating\nto the securities made through Euroclear or\nClearstream must comply with the rules and\nprocedures of those systems. Those clearing\nsystems could change their rules and\nprocedures at any time. We do not have control\nover those systems or their participants, and\nwe do not take responsibility for their\nactivities. Transactions between participants\nin Euroclear or Clearstream, on one hand, and\nparticipants in DTC, on the other hand, when\nDTC is the depositary, would also be subject\nto DTC\u0092s rules and procedures. Special Timing\nConsiderations for Transactions in Euroclear\nand Clearstream Investors will be able to make\nand receive through Euroclear and Clearstream\npayments, deliveries, transfers, exchanges,\nnotices and other transactions involving any\nsecurities held through 110\n\nthose clearing systems only on days when those\nsystems are open for business. These clearing\nsystems may not be open for business on days\nwhen banks, brokers and other institutions are\nopen for\nbusiness in the United States.\n\nIn addition, because of time-zone differences,\nU.S. investors who hold their interests in the\nsecurities through\nthese clearing systems and wish to transfer\ntheir interests, or to receive or make a\npayment or delivery or exercise any other\nright with respect to their interests, on a\nparticular day may find that the transaction\nwill not be effected until the\nnext business day in Luxembourg or Brussels,\nas applicable. Thus, investors who wish to\nexercise rights that expire on a particular\nday may need to act before the expiration\ndate. In addition, investors who hold their\ninterests through both DTC and\nEuroclear or Clearstream may need to make\nspecial arrangements to finance any purchases\nor sales of their interests between the U.S.\nand European clearing systems, and those\ntransactions may settle later than would be\nthe case for transactions\nwithin one clearing system.\n\n111\n\nCONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO FLOATING RATE\nSECURITIES\n\nLIBOR May Be Discontinued; Discontinuance\nDates May Differ for Different LIBOR\nCurrencies and Tenors\n\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the\nU.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\u0093FCA\u0094),\nwhich regulates the LIBOR administrator,\nannounced\nthat the FCA will no longer persuade or compel\nbanks to submit rates for the calculation of\nLIBOR after 2021. On November 30, 2020, the\nICE Benchmark Administration Limited (\u0093IBA\u0094),\nwhich is supervised by the UK Financial\nConduct\nAuthority, announced a proposal to extend the\npublication of the most commonly used LIBOR\ntenors (overnight and one, three, six and 12\nmonths) until June 30, 2023. The Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency have strongly\nencouraged banks to cease entering into new\ncontracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference\nrate as soon as practicable and in any event\nby December 31, 2021.\nThe IBA has also proposed to cease publishing\nLIBOR for other tenors and currencies on\nDecember 31, 2021. Although the foregoing may\nprovide some sense of timing, there is no\nassurance that LIBOR, of any particular\ncurrency and tenor, will\ncontinue to be published until any particular\ndate, and it appears highly likely that LIBOR\nwill be discontinued or modified after\nDecember 31, 2021 or June 30, 2023, depending\non the currency and tenor.\n\nIt is not possible to predict the effect that\nthese announcements or any such discontinuance\nwill have on LIBOR or on floating rate\nsecurities linked to\nLIBOR (\u0093LIBOR-linked securities\u0094). If the\ncalculation agent determines that a benchmark\ntransition event and its related benchmark\nreplacement date have occurred with respect to\nLIBOR for particular LIBOR-linked securities,\nthen a\nbenchmark replacement will be selected by the\ncalculation agent in accordance with the\nbenchmark transition provisions of the\nrelevant securities. The selection of a\nbenchmark replacement, and any decisions,\ndeterminations or elections made by the\ncalculation agent in connection with\nimplementing a benchmark replacement with\nrespect to LIBOR-linked securities in\naccordance with the relevant benchmark\ntransition provisions could result in adverse\nconsequences to the interest rate, which could\nadversely affect the return on, value of and\nmarket for LIBOR-linked securities. Further,\nthere is no assurance that the characteristics\nof any benchmark replacement will be similar\nto LIBOR, or that any benchmark replacement\nwill produce the\neconomic equivalent of LIBOR. See \u0093Description\nof Debt Securities We May Offer \u0097 Calculations\nof Interest on Debt Securities \u0097 Floating Rate\nDebt Securities \u0097 LIBOR\u0094.\n\nRegulation and Reform of \u0093Benchmarks\u0094,\nIncluding LIBOR and Other Types of Benchmarks,\nMay Cause such \u0093Benchmarks\u0094 to Perform\nDifferently Than in the Past, or to Disappear\nEntirely, or Have Other Consequences Which\nCannot be Predicted\n\nLIBOR and other interest rate, equity, foreign\nexchange rate and other types of indices which\nare deemed to be \u0093benchmarks\u0094 are the subject\nof recent international, national and other\nregulatory guidance and proposals for reform.\nSome of these reforms are already effective\nwhile others\nare still to be implemented. These reforms may\ncause such \u0093benchmarks\u0094 to perform differently\nthan in the past, or to disappear entirely, or\nhave other consequences which cannot be\npredicted. Any such consequence could have a\nmaterial\nadverse effect on your floating rate\nsecurities.\n\nAny of the international, national or other\nproposals for reform or the general increased\nregulatory scrutiny of \u0093benchmarks\u0094 could\nincrease the costs and risks of administering\nor otherwise participating in the setting of a\n\u0093benchmark\u0094 and complying with any such\nregulations or requirements. Such factors may\nhave the\neffect of discouraging market participants\nfrom continuing to administer or contribute to\ncertain \u0093benchmarks\u0094, trigger changes in the\nrules or methodologies used in certain\n\u0093benchmarks\u0094 or lead to the disappearance of\ncertain\n\u0093benchmarks\u0094. The disappearance of a\n\u0093benchmark\u0094 or changes in\n\n112\n\nthe manner of administration of a \u0093benchmark\u0094\ncould result in discretionary valuation by the\ncalculation agent or other consequence in\nrelation to your floating rate securities. Any\nsuch consequence could have a material adverse\neffect on the value of and return on your\nfloating rate securities.\n\nCertain Risks Related to LIBOR\n\nUnder the benchmark transition provisions of\ncertain of our LIBOR-linked securities, if a\nbenchmark transition event and its related\nbenchmark replacement date have occurred with\nrespect to LIBOR, then the rate of interest on\nthe LIBOR-linked securities will be determined\nbased on SOFR.\n\nThe composition and characteristics of SOFR\nare not the same as those of LIBOR and SOFR is\nfundamentally different from LIBOR for two key\nreasons.\nFirst, SOFR is a secured rate, while LIBOR is\nan unsecured rate. Second, SOFR is an\novernight rate, while LIBOR is a forward-\nlooking rate that represents interbank funding\nover different maturities (e.g., three\nmonths). As a result, there can be no\nassurance that SOFR (including term SOFR or\ncompounded SOFR) will perform in the same way\nas LIBOR would have at any time, including,\nwithout limitation, as a result of changes in\ninterest and yield rates in the market, market\nvolatility or global\nor regional economic, financial, political,\nregulatory, judicial or other events. See \u0093\u0097\nCertain Risks Related to SOFR\u0094 below.\n\nAdditionally, LIBOR-linked securities which\nhave benchmark transition provisions may not\nhave an established trading market if a\nbenchmark transition\nevent and its related benchmark replacement\ndate have occurred, and an established trading\nmarket in each case may never develop or may\nnot be very liquid.\n\nCertain Risks Related to SOFR\n\nOn June 22, 2017,\nthe Alternative Reference Rates Committee\n(\u0093ARRC\u0094) convened by the Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System and the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York identified SOFR, a\nbroad U.S. treasuries repurchase financing\nrate to be published\nby the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as\nthe rate that, in the consensus view of the\nARRC, represented best practice for use in\ncertain new U.S. dollar derivatives and other\nfinancial contracts. SOFR is a broad measure\nof the cost of borrowing\ncash overnight collateralized by U.S. treasury\nsecurities and has been published by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York since April\n2018. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has\nalso published historical indicative Secured\nOvernight Financing\nRates going back to 2014. Investors should not\nrely on any historical changes or trends in\nSOFR as an indicator of future changes in\nSOFR.\n\nBecause\nSOFR is published by the Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York based on data received from other\nsources, we have no control over its\ndetermination, calculation or publication. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York notes on its\npublication page for SOFR\nthat use of SOFR is subject to important\nlimitations and disclaimers, including that\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York may alter\nthe methods of calculation, publication\nschedule, rate revision practices or\navailability of SOFR at any time without\nnotice. There can be no guarantee,\nparticularly given its relatively recent\nintroduction, that SOFR will not be\ndiscontinued or fundamentally altered in a\nmanner that is materially adverse to the\ninterests of investors in SOFR-linked floating\nrate\nsecurities. If the manner in which SOFR is\ncalculated is changed, that change may result\nin a reduction of the amount of interest\npayable on SOFR-linked floating rate\nsecurities and the trading prices of such\nsecurities. In addition, the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York may withdraw, modify\nor amend published SOFR data in its sole\ndiscretion and without notice. The interest\nrate for any day will not be adjusted for any\nmodifications or amendments to SOFR data that\nthe Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York may publish after the interest\nrate for that day has been determined.\n\nAdditionally, daily changes in SOFR have, on\noccasion, been more\nvolatile than daily changes in other benchmark\nor market rates. Although occasional,\nincreased daily volatility in SOFR would not\n\n113\n\nnecessarily lead to more volatile interest\npayments, the return on and value of SOFR-\nlinked floating rate securities may fluctuate\nmore than floating rate securities that are\nlinked to less\nvolatile rates. In addition, the volatility of\nSOFR has reflected the underlying volatility\nof the overnight U.S. Treasury repo market.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York has at\ntimes conducted operations in the overnight\nU.S. Treasury repo market\nin order to help maintain the federal funds\nrate within a target range. There can be no\nassurance that the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork will continue to conduct such operations\nin the future, and the duration and extent of\nany such operations is\ninherently uncertain. The effect of any such\noperations, or of the cessation of such\noperations to the extent they are commenced,\nis uncertain and could be materially adverse\nto investors in SOFR-linked floating rate\nsecurities.\n\nSince SOFR is a relatively new reference rate,\nSOFR-linked floating rate securities may not\nhave an established trading market when issued\nand an\nestablished trading market in each case may\nnever develop or may not be very liquid.\nMarket terms for floating-rate securities\nlinked to SOFR, such as the spread over the\nbase rate reflected in interest rate\nprovisions or the manner of compounding\nthe base rate, may evolve over time, and\ntrading prices of such securities may be lower\nthan those of later-issued SOFR-linked\nfloating rate securities as a result.\nSimilarly, if SOFR does not prove to be widely\nused in floating rate securities, the\ntrading price of SOFR-linked floating rate\nsecurities may be lower than those of\nsecurities linked to reference rates that are\nmore widely used. Investors in such securities\nmay not be able to sell such securities at all\nor may not be able to sell\nsuch securities at prices that will provide\nthem with a yield comparable to similar\ninvestments that have a developed secondary\nmarket, and may consequently suffer from\nincreased pricing volatility and market risk.\n\nThe Calculation Agent Will Have the Authority\nto Make Determinations That Could Affect the\nMarket Value of Your Floating Rate Securities\n\nIf GS&Co. is named as calculation agent for\nyour floating rate securities, GS&Co. will\nmake determinations with respect to the\nfloating rate\nsecurities as specified herein and in your\nprospectus supplement and may have discretion\nin calculating the amounts payable in respect\nof the floating rate securities. If GS&Co.\ndetermines that a benchmark replacement date\nwith respect to\nLIBOR-linked floating rate securities or SOFR-\nlinked floating rate securities has occurred,\nit will determine, among other things, the\napplicable benchmark replacement, the\napplicable benchmark replacement adjustment,\nand the applicable benchmark\nreplacement conforming changes, and such\ndeterminations will be conclusive and binding\nabsent manifest error. The exercise of this\ndiscretion by GS&Co. could adversely affect\nthe value of your floating rate securities and\nmay present GS&Co.\nwith a conflict of interest. We may change the\ncalculation agent at any time without notice,\nand the calculation agent may resign as\ncalculation agent at any time upon 60 days\u0092\nwritten notice to us.\n\n114\n\nCONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO INDEXED SECURITIES\n\nWe use the term \u0093indexed securities\u0094 to mean\nany of the securities described in this\nprospectus, or any units that include\nsecurities, whose\nvalue is linked to an underlying asset or\nindex or another property (including one or\nmore securities or indices of securities).\nIndexed securities may present a high level of\nrisk, and investors in certain indexed\nsecurities may lose their entire\ninvestment. In addition, the treatment of\nindexed securities for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes is often unclear due to the absence\nof any authority specifically addressing the\nissues presented by any particular indexed\nsecurity. Thus, if you\npropose to invest in indexed securities, you\nshould independently evaluate the federal\nincome tax consequences of purchasing an\nindexed security that apply in your particular\ncircumstances. You should also read \u0093United\nStates Taxation\u0094\nbelow for a discussion of U.S. tax matters.\n\nWe May Engage in Hedging Activities that Could\nAdversely Affect an Indexed Security\n\nIn order to hedge an exposure on a particular\nindexed security, we may, directly or through\nour affiliates, enter into transactions\ninvolving the\nsecurities, commodities or currencies or other\ninstruments or measures that underlie the\nindex for that security, or derivative\ninstruments, such as swaps, options or\nfutures, on the index or any of its component\nitems. By engaging in transactions\nof this kind, we could adversely affect the\nvalue of an indexed security. It is possible\nthat we could achieve substantial returns from\nour hedging transactions while the value of\nthe indexed security may decline.\n\nWe May Have Conflicts of Interest Regarding an\nIndexed Security\n\nGS&Co. and our other affiliates may have\nconflicts of interest with respect to some\nindexed securities. GS&Co. and our other\naffiliates may\nengage in trading, including trading for\nhedging purposes, for their own accounts or\nfor other accounts under their management, in\nindexed securities and in the securities,\ncommodities or currencies or other instruments\nor measures on which the\nindex is based or in other derivative\ninstruments related to the index or its\ncomponent items. These trading activities\ncould adversely affect the value of indexed\nsecurities. We and our affiliates may also\nissue or underwrite securities or\nderivative instruments that are linked to the\nsame index as one or more indexed securities.\nBy introducing competing products into the\nmarketplace in this manner, we could adversely\naffect the value of an indexed security.\n\nGS&Co. or another of our affiliates may serve\nas calculation agent for the indexed\nsecurities and may have considerable\ndiscretion in calculating\nthe amounts payable in respect of the\nsecurities. To the extent that GS&Co. or\nanother of our affiliates calculates or\ncompiles a particular index, it may also have\nconsiderable discretion in performing the\ncalculation or compilation of the\nindex. Exercising discretion in this manner\ncould adversely affect the value of an indexed\nsecurity based on the index or the rate of\nreturn on the security.\n\n115\n\nCONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO SECURITIES\nDENOMINATED OR PAYABLE IN OR LINKED TO A\nNON-U.S.DOLLAR CURRENCY If you intend to\ninvest in a non-U.S.dollar security \u0097 e.g., a\nsecurity whose principal and/or interest is\npayable in a currency other than U.S. dollars\nor that may be settled by delivery of or\nreference to a non-U.S.dollar currency or\nproperty denominated in or otherwise linked to\na non-U.S.dollar currency \u0097 you should consult\nyour own financial and legal advisors as to\nthe currency risks entailed by your\ninvestment. Securities of this kind may not be\nan appropriate investment for investors who\nare unsophisticated with respect to\nnon-U.S.dollar currency transactions. The\ninformation in this prospectus is directed\nprimarily to investors who are U.S. residents.\nInvestors who are not U.S. residents should\nconsult their own financial and legal advisors\nabout currency-related risks particular to\ntheir investment. An Investment in a\nNon-U.S.Dollar Security Involves Currency-\nRelated Risks An investment in a\nnon-U.S.dollar security entails significant\nrisks that are not associated with a similar\ninvestment in a security that is payable\nsolely in U.S. dollars and where settlement\nvalue is not otherwise based on a\nnon-U.S.dollar currency. These risks include\nthe possibility of significant changes in\nrates of exchange between the U.S. dollar and\nthe various non-U.S.dollar currencies or\ncomposite currencies and the possibility of\nthe imposition or modification of foreign\nexchange controls or other conditions by\neither the United States or\nnon-U.S.governments. These risks generally\ndepend on factors over which we have no\ncontrol, such as economic and political events\nand the supply of and demand for the relevant\ncurrencies in the global markets. Changes in\nCurrency Exchange Rates Can Be Volatile and\nUnpredictable Rates of exchange between the\nU.S. dollar and many other currencies have\nbeen highly volatile, and this volatility may\ncontinue and perhaps spread to other\ncurrencies in the future. Fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates could adversely affect\nan investment in a security denominated in, or\nwhose value is otherwise linked to, a\nspecified currency other than U.S. dollars.\nDepreciation of the specified currency against\nthe U.S. dollar could result in a decrease in\nthe U.S. dollar-equivalent value of payments\non the security, including the principal\npayable at maturity or settlement value\npayable upon exercise. That in turn could\ncause the market value of the security to\nfall. Depreciation of the specified currency\nagainst the U.S. dollar could result in a loss\nto the investor on a U.S. dollar basis.\nExchange rates are the result of the supply\nof, and the demand for, the relevant\ncurrencies. Changes in exchange rates result\nover time, and may vary considerably during\nthe life of an investment denominated in or\notherwise relating to a foreign currency, from\nthe interaction of many factors directly or\nindirectly affecting economic and political\nconditions in the country or area of the\napplicable currency, including economic and\npolitical developments in other countries. Of\nparticular importance to potential currency\nexchange risk are:\n                                              \n      existing and expected rates of          \n      inflation;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      existing and expected interest rate     \n      levels;                                 \n                                              \n                                \n      the balance of payments;  \n                                \n                                              \n      the extent of governmental surpluses    \n      or deficits in the relevant countries;  \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      other financial, economic, military     \n      and political factors.                  \n                                              \nAll of these factors are, in turn, sensitive\nto the monetary, fiscal and trade policies\npursued by the government of the applicable\ncountry and other countries important to\ninternational trade and finance. 116\n\nIt has been reported that the U.K. Financial\nConduct Authority and regulators from other\ncountries,\nincluding the United States, are in the\nprocess of investigating the potential\nmanipulation of published currency exchange\nrates. If such manipulation has occurred or is\ncontinuing, certain published exchange rates\nmay have been, or may be in the\nfuture, artificially lower (or higher) than\nthey would otherwise have been. Any such\nmanipulation could have an adverse impact on\nany payments on, and the value of, an\ninvestment in a security denominated in, or\nwhose value is otherwise linked to, a\nspecified currency other than U.S. dollars,\nincluding the value of any such investment in\nthe trading markets. In addition, we cannot\npredict whether any changes or reforms\naffecting the determination or publication of\nexchange rates or the\nsupervision of currency trading will be\nimplemented in connection with these\ninvestigations. Any such changes or reforms\ncould also adversely impact any such\ninvestment.\n\nGovernment Policy Can Adversely Affect Foreign\nCurrency Exchange Rates and an Investment in a\nNon-U.S.Dollar Security\n\nForeign currency exchange rates can either\nfloat or be fixed by sovereign governments.\nFrom time to time, governments use a variety\nof\ntechniques, such as intervention by a\ncountry\u0092s central bank or imposition of\nregulatory controls or taxes, to affect the\nexchange rate of their currencies. Governments\nmay also issue a new currency to replace an\nexisting currency or alter the\nexchange rate or exchange characteristics by\ndevaluation or revaluation of a currency.\nThus, a special risk in purchasing non-U.S.\ndollar securities is that their yields or\npayouts could be significantly and\nunpredictably affected by governmental\nactions. Even in the absence of governmental\naction directly affecting currency exchange\nrates, political or economic developments in\nthe country issuing the specified currency for\na non-U.S. dollar security or elsewhere could\nlead to significant and sudden changes in the\nexchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the\nspecified currency. These changes could affect\nthe value of the security as\nparticipants in the global currency markets\nmove to buy or sell the specified currency or\nU.S. dollars in reaction to these\ndevelopments.\n\nGovernments have imposed from time to time and\nmay in the future impose exchange controls or\nother conditions, including taxes, with\nrespect to the\nexchange or transfer of a specified currency\nthat could affect exchange rates as well as\nthe availability of a specified currency for a\nsecurity at its maturity or on any other\npayment date. In addition, the ability of a\nholder to move currency\nfreely out of the country in which payment in\nthe currency is received or to convert the\ncurrency at a freely determined market rate\ncould be limited by governmental actions.\n\nNon-U.S.Dollar Securities May Permit Us to\nMake Payments in U.S. Dollars or Delay Payment\nIf We Are Unable to Obtain the Specified\nCurrency\n\nSecurities payable in a currency other than\nU.S. dollars may provide that, if the other\ncurrency is subject to\nconvertibility, transferability, market\ndisruption or other conditions affecting its\navailability at or about the time when a\npayment on the securities comes due because of\ncircumstances beyond our control, we will be\nentitled to make the payment in\nU.S. dollars or delay making the payment.\nThese circumstances could include the\nimposition of exchange controls or our\ninability to obtain the other currency because\nof a disruption in the currency markets. If we\nmade payment in U.S. dollars, the\nexchange rate we would use would be determined\nin the manner described above under\n\u0093Description of Debt Securities We May Offer \u0097\nPayment Mechanics for Debt Securities \u0097 How We\nWill Make Payments Due in Other Currencies \u0097\nWhen\nthe Specified Currency Is Not Available\u0094. A\ndetermination of this kind may be based on\nlimited information and would involve\nsignificant discretion on the part of our\nexchange rate agent, which may be an affiliate\nof ours. As a result, the\nvalue of the payment in U.S. dollars an\ninvestor would receive on the payment date may\nbe less than the value of the payment the\ninvestor would have received in the other\ncurrency if it had been available, or may be\nzero. In addition, a government\nmay impose extraordinary taxes on transfers of\na currency. If that happens we will be\nentitled to deduct these taxes from any\npayment on securities payable in that\ncurrency.\n\n117\n\nWe Will Not Adjust Non-U.S.Dollar Securities\nto Compensate for Changes in Foreign Currency\nExchange Rates\n\nExcept as described above, we will not make\nany adjustment or change in the terms of a\nnon-U.S. dollar security in the event of any\nchange in foreign currency exchange rates for\nthe relevant currency, whether in the event of\nany devaluation, revaluation or imposition of\nexchange or other regulatory\ncontrols or taxes or in the event of other\ndevelopments affecting that currency, the U.S.\ndollar or any other currency. Consequently,\ninvestors in non-U.S. dollar securities will\nbear the risk that their\ninvestment may be adversely affected by these\ntypes of events.\n\nIn a Lawsuit for Payment on a Non-U.S.Dollar\nSecurity, an Investor May Bear Foreign\nCurrency Exchange Risk\n\nOur debt securities, warrants, purchase\ncontracts and units will be governed\nby New York law. Under Section 27 of the New\nYork Judiciary Law, a state court in the State\nof New York rendering a judgment on a security\ndenominated in a currency other than U.S.\ndollars would be required to render the\njudgment in the\nspecified currency; however, the judgment\nwould be converted into U.S. dollars at the\nexchange rate prevailing on the date of entry\nof the judgment. Consequently, in a lawsuit\nfor payment on a security denominated in a\ncurrency other than U.S.\ndollars, investors would bear currency\nexchange risk until judgment is entered, which\ncould be a long time.\n\nIn courts outside of New York,\ninvestors may not be able to obtain judgment\nin a specified currency other than U.S.\ndollars. For example, a judgment for money in\nan action based on a non-U.S. dollar security\nin many other U.S. federal or\nstate courts ordinarily would be enforced in\nthe United States only in U.S. dollars. The\ndate used to determine the rate of conversion\nof the currency in which any particular\nsecurity is denominated into U.S. dollars will\ndepend upon various\nfactors, including which court renders the\njudgment.\n\nInformation About Foreign Currency Exchange\nRates May Not Be Indicative of Future\nPerformance\n\nIf we issue a non-U.S. dollar security, we may\ninclude in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement a\ncurrency supplement that provides information\nabout historical exchange rates for the\nrelevant non-U.S. dollar currency or\ncurrencies. Any information about exchange\nrates that we may provide will be furnished\nas a matter of information only, and you\nshould not regard the information as\nindicative of the range of, or trends in,\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates that\nmay occur in the future. That rate will likely\ndiffer from the exchange rate used\nunder the terms that apply to a particular\nsecurity.\n\nDeterminations Made by the Exchange Rate Agent\n\nAll determinations made by the exchange rate\nagent will be made in its sole discretion\n(except to the extent expressly provided in\nthis prospectus or in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement that any\ndetermination is subject to approval by The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc.). In the absence of\nmanifest error, its determinations will be\nconclusive for all purposes and will bind all\nholders and us. The\nexchange rate agent will not have any\nliability for its determinations.\n\n118\n\nUNITED STATES TAXATION This section describes\nthe material United States federal income tax\nconsequences of owning certain of the debt\nsecurities, preferred stock and depositary\nshares we are offering.

These laws are subject to\nchange, possibly on a retroactive basis. If an\nentity or arrangement that is treated as a\npartnership for United States federal income\ntax purposes holds the securities, the United\nStates federal income tax treatment of a\npartner will generally depend on the status of\nthe partner and the tax treatment of the\npartnership. A partner in a partnership\nholding the securities should consult its tax\nadvisor with regard to the United States\nfederal income tax treatment of an investment\nin the securities. Please consult your own tax\nadvisor concerning the consequences of owning\nthese securities in your particular\ncircumstances under the Internal Revenue Code\nand the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.\n119\n\nTaxation of Debt Securities This subsection\ndescribes the material United States federal\nincome tax consequences of owning, selling and\ndisposing of the debt securities we are\noffering, other than the debt securities\ndescribed below under \u0093\u0097 United States Holders\n\u0097 Indexed and Other Debt Securities\u0094, which\nwill be described in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. It deals only with debt securities\nthat are due to mature 30 years or less from\nthe date on which they are issued. The United\nStates federal income tax consequences of\nowning debt securities that are due to mature\nmore than 30 years from their date of issue\nwill be discussed in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. The tax consequences of any\nparticular debt security will depend on its\nterms, and any particular offering of debt\nsecurities may have features or terms that\ncause the United States federal income tax\ntreatment of the debt securities to differ\nmaterially from the discussion below. An\napplicable prospectus supplement will discuss\nany material differences from the discussion\nbelow. United States Holders This subsection\ndescribes the tax consequences to a United\nStates holder. You are a United States holder\nif you are a beneficial owner of a debt\nsecurity and you are, for United States\nfederal income tax purposes:\n                                              \n      a citizen or resident of the United     \n      States;                                 \n                                              \n                               \n      a domestic corporation;  \n                               \n                                              \n      an estate whose income is subject to    \n      United States federal income tax        \n      regardless of its source; or            \n                                              \n                                              \n      a trust if a United States court can    \n      exercise primary supervision over the   \n      trust\u0092s administration and one or more   \n      United States persons are authorized    \n      to control all substantial decisions    \n      of the trust.                           \n                                              \nIf you are not a United States holder, this\nsubsection does not apply to you and you\nshould refer to \u0093\u0097 Non-UnitedStates Holders\u0094\nbelow. Payments of Interest General Except as\ndescribed below in the case of interest on an\noriginal issue discount debt security that is\nnot qualified stated interest, each as defined\nbelow under \u0093\u0097 Original Issue Discount \u0097\nGeneral\u0094, you will be taxed on any interest on\nyour debt security, whether payable in U.S.\ndollars or a non-U.S.dollar currency,\nincluding a composite currency or basket of\ncurrencies other than U.S. dollars, as\nordinary income at the time you receive the\ninterest or when it accrues, depending on your\nmethod of accounting for tax purposes. Foreign\nCurrency Debt Securities \u0097 Cash Basis\nTaxpayers If you are a taxpayer that uses the\ncash receipts and disbursements method of\naccounting for tax purposes and you receive an\ninterest payment that is denominated in, or\ndetermined by reference to, a non-U.S.dollar\ncurrency, you must recognize income equal to\nthe U.S. dollar value of the interest payment,\nbased on the exchange rate in effect on the\ndate of receipt, regardless of whether you\nactually convert the payment into U.S.\ndollars. 120\n\nForeign Currency Debt Securities \u0097 Accrual\nBasis Taxpayers\n\nIf you are a taxpayer that uses an accrual\nmethod of accounting for tax purposes, you may\ndetermine the amount of income that you\nrecognize with respect\nto an interest payment denominated in, or\ndetermined by reference to, a non-U.S. dollar\ncurrency by using one of two methods. Under\nthe first method, you will determine the\namount of income accrued based on\nthe average exchange rate in effect during the\ninterest accrual period or, with respect to an\naccrual period that spans two taxable years,\nthat part of the period within the taxable\nyear.\n\nIf you elect the second method, you would\ndetermine the amount of income accrued on the\nbasis of the exchange rate in effect on the\nlast day of the\naccrual period, or, in the case of an accrual\nperiod that spans two taxable years, the\nexchange rate in effect on the last day of the\npart of the period within the taxable year.\nAdditionally, under this second method, if you\nreceive a payment of\ninterest within five business days of the last\nday of your accrual period or taxable year,\nyou may instead translate the interest accrued\ninto U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in\neffect on the day that you actually receive\nthe interest payment. If\nyou elect the second method, it will apply to\nall debt instruments that you hold at the\nbeginning of the first taxable year to which\nthe election applies and to all debt\ninstruments that you subsequently acquire. You\nmay not revoke this election\nwithout the consent of the Internal Revenue\nService.\n\nWhen you actually receive an interest payment,\nincluding a payment attributable to accrued\nbut\nunpaid interest upon the sale or retirement of\nyour debt security, denominated in, or\ndetermined by reference to, a non-U.S. dollar\ncurrency for which you accrued an amount of\nincome, you will recognize\nordinary income or loss measured by the\ndifference, if any, between the exchange rate\nthat you used to accrue interest income and\nthe exchange rate in effect on the date of\nreceipt, regardless of whether you actually\nconvert the payment into U.S.\ndollars.\n\nOriginal Issue Discount\n\nGeneral\n\nIf you own a debt security, other than a\nshort-term debt security with a term of one\nyear or less, it will be treated as an\noriginal issue discount debt\nsecurity if the amount by which the debt\nsecurity\u0092s stated redemption price at maturity\nexceeds its issue price is more than a de\nminimis amount. Generally, a debt security\u0092s\nissue price will be the first price at which a\nsubstantial\namount of debt securities included in the\nissue of which the debt security is a part is\nsold to persons other than bond houses,\nbrokers, or similar persons or organizations\nacting in the capacity of underwriters,\nplacement agents, or wholesalers. A\ndebt security\u0092s stated redemption price at\nmaturity is the total of all payments provided\nby the debt security that are not payments of\nqualified stated interest. Generally, an\ninterest payment on a debt security is\nqualified stated interest if\nit is one of a series of stated interest\npayments on a debt security that are\nunconditionally payable at least annually at a\nsingle fixed rate, with certain exceptions for\nlower rates paid during some periods, applied\nto the outstanding principal\namount of the debt security. There are special\nrules for variable rate debt securities that\nare discussed below under \u0093\u0097 Variable Rate\nDebt Securities\u0094.\n\nIn general, your debt security is not an\noriginal issue discount debt security if the\namount by which its stated redemption price at\nmaturity exceeds\nits issue price is less than the de minimis\namount of 0.25 percent of its stated\nredemption price at maturity multiplied by the\nnumber of complete years to its maturity. Your\ndebt security will have de minimis original\nissue discount if the\namount of the excess is less than the de\nminimis amount. If your debt security has de\nminimis original issue discount, you must\ninclude the de minimis amount in income as\nstated principal payments are made on the debt\nsecurity, unless you make the\nelection described below under \u0093\u0097 Election to\nTreat All Interest as Original Issue\n\n121\n\nDiscount\u0094. You can determine the includible\namount with respect to each such payment by\nmultiplying the total amount of your debt\nsecurity\u0092s de minimis original issue discount\nby a fraction equal to:\n                                              \n      the amount of the principal payment     \n      made                                    \n                                              \ndivided by:\n                                              \n      the stated principal amount of the      \n      debt security.                          \n                                              \nGenerally, if your original issue discount\ndebt security matures more than one year from\nits date of issue, you must include original\nissue discount in income before you receive\ncash attributable to that income. The amount\nof original issue discount that you must\ninclude in income is calculated using a\nconstant-yield method, and generally you will\ninclude increasingly greater amounts of\noriginal issue discount in income over the\nlife of your debt security. More specifically,\nyou can calculate the amount of original issue\ndiscount that you must include in income by\nadding the daily portions of original issue\ndiscount with respect to your original issue\ndiscount debt security for each day during the\ntaxable year or portion of the taxable year\nthat you hold your original issue discount\ndebt security. You can determine the daily\nportion by allocating to each day in any\naccrual period a pro rata portion of the\noriginal issue discount allocable to that\naccrual period. You may select an accrual\nperiod of any length with respect to your\noriginal issue discount debt security and you\nmay vary the length of each accrual period\nover the term of your original issue discount\ndebt security. However, no accrual period may\nbe longer than one year and each scheduled\npayment of interest or principal on the\noriginal issue discount debt security must\noccur on either the first or final day of an\naccrual period. You can determine the amount\nof original issue discount allocable to an\naccrual period by:\n                                              \n      multiplying your original issue         \n      discount debt security\u0092s adjusted issue  \n      price at the beginning of the accrual   \n      period                                  \n      by your debt security\u0092s yield to         \n      maturity; and then                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      subtracting from this figure the sum    \n      of the payments of qualified stated     \n      interest on your debt security          \n      allocable to the                        \n      accrual period.                         \n                                              \nYou must determine the original issue discount\ndebt security\u0092s yield to maturity on the basis\nof compounding at the close of each accrual\nperiod and adjusting for the length of each\naccrual period. Further, you determine your\noriginal issue discount debt security\u0092s\nadjusted issue price at the beginning of any\naccrual period by:\n                                              \n      adding your original issue discount     \n      debt security\u0092s issue price and any      \n      accrued original issue discount for     \n      each prior                              \n      accrual period; and then                \n                                              \n                                              \n      subtracting any payments previously     \n      made on your original issue discount    \n      debt security that were not qualified   \n      stated                                  \n      interest payments.                      \n                                              \nIf an interval between payments of qualified\nstated interest on your original issue\ndiscount debt security contains more than one\naccrual period, then, when you determine the\namount of original issue discount allocable to\nan accrual period, you must allocate the\namount of qualified stated interest payable at\nthe end of the interval, including any\nqualified stated interest that is payable on\nthe first day of the accrual period\nimmediately following the interval, pro rata\nto each accrual period in the interval based\non their relative lengths. In addition, you\nmust increase the adjusted issue price at the\nbeginning of each accrual period in the\ninterval by the amount of any qualified stated\ninterest that has accrued prior to the first\nday of the accrual period but that is not\npayable until the end of the interval. You may\ncompute the amount of original issue discount\nallocable to an initial short accrual period\nby using any reasonable method if all other\naccrual periods, other than a final short\naccrual period, are of equal length. 122\n\nThe amount of original issue discount\nallocable to the final accrual period is equal\nto the difference between:\n                                              \n      the amount payable at the maturity of   \n      your debt security, other than any      \n      payment of qualified stated interest;   \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      your debt security\u0092s adjusted issue      \n      price as of the beginning of the final  \n      accrual period.                         \n                                              \nAcquisition Premium If you purchase your debt\nsecurity for an amount that is less than or\nequal to the sum of all amounts, other than\nqualified stated interest, payable on your\ndebt security after the purchase date but is\ngreater than the amount of your debt\nsecurity\u0092s adjusted issue price, as determined\nabove under \u0093\u0097 General\u0094, the excess is\nacquisition premium. If you do not make the\nelection described below under \u0093\u0097 Election to\nTreat All Interest as Original Issue\nDiscount\u0094, then you must reduce the daily\nportions of original issue discount by a\nfraction equal to:\n                                              \n      the excess of your adjusted basis in    \n      the debt security immediately after     \n      purchase over the adjusted issue price  \n      of the debt                             \n      security                                \n                                              \ndivided by:\n                                              \n      the excess of the sum of all amounts    \n      payable, other than qualified stated    \n      interest, on the debt security after    \n      the purchase                            \n      date over the debt security\u0092s adjusted   \n      issue price.                            \n                                              \nPre-IssuanceAccrued Interest An election may\nbe made to decrease the issue price of your\ndebt security by the amount of pre-\nissuanceaccrued interest if:\n                                              \n      a portion of the initial purchase       \n      price of your debt security is          \n      attributable to                         \n      pre-issuance accrued interest;          \n                                              \n                                              \n      the first stated interest payment on    \n      your debt security is to be made        \n      within one year of your debt security\u0092s  \n      issue                                   \n      date; and                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      the payment will equal or exceed the    \n      amount of pre-issuance accrued          \n      interest.                               \n                                              \nIf this election is made, a portion of the\nfirst stated interest payment will be treated\nas a return of the excluded pre-\nissuanceaccrued interest and not as an amount\npayable on your debt security. Debt Securities\nSubject to Contingencies Including Optional\nRedemption Your debt security is subject to a\ncontingency if it provides for an alternative\npayment schedule or schedules applicable upon\nthe occurrence of a contingency or\ncontingencies, other than a remote or\nincidental contingency, whether such\ncontingency relates to payments of interest or\nof principal. In such a case, you must\ndetermine the yield and maturity of your debt\nsecurity by assuming that the payments will be\nmade according to the payment schedule most\nlikely to occur if:\n                                              \n      the timing and amounts of the payments  \n      that comprise each payment schedule     \n      are known as of the issue date; and     \n                                              \n                                              \n      one of such schedules is significantly  \n      more likely than not to occur.          \n                                              \nIf there is no single payment schedule that is\nsignificantly more likely than not to occur,\nother than because of a mandatory sinking\nfund, you must include income on your debt\nsecurity in accordance with the general rules\nthat govern contingent payment debt\ninstruments. These rules will be discussed in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement. 123\n\nNotwithstanding the general rules for\ndetermining yield and maturity, if your debt\nsecurity is subject to contingencies, and\neither you or we have an unconditional option\nor options that, if exercised, would require\npayments to be made on the debt security under\nan alternative payment schedule or schedules,\nthen:\n                                              \n      in the case of an option or options     \n      that we may exercise, we will be        \n      deemed to exercise or not exercise an   \n      option or                               \n      combination of options in the manner    \n      that minimizes the yield on your debt   \n      security; and                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      in the case of an option or options     \n      that you may exercise, you will be      \n      deemed to exercise or not exercise an   \n      option or                               \n      combination of options in the manner    \n      that maximizes the yield on your debt   \n      security.                               \n                                              \nIf both you and we hold options described in\nthe preceding sentence, those rules will apply\nto each option in the order in which they may\nbe exercised. You may determine the yield on\nyour debt security for the purposes of those\ncalculations by using any date on which your\ndebt security may be redeemed or repurchased\nas the maturity date and the amount payable on\nthe date that you chose in accordance with the\nterms of your debt security as the principal\namount payable at maturity. If a contingency,\nincluding the exercise of an option, actually\noccurs or does not occur contrary to an\nassumption made according to the above rules\nthen, except to the extent that a portion of\nyour debt security is repaid as a result of\nthis change in circumstances and solely to\ndetermine the amount and accrual of original\nissue discount, you must redetermine the yield\nand maturity of your debt security by treating\nyour debt security as having been retired and\nreissued on the date of the change in\ncircumstances for an amount equal to your debt\nsecurity\u0092s adjusted issue price on that date.\nElection to Treat All Interest as Original\nIssue Discount You may elect to include in\ngross income all interest that accrues on your\ndebt security using the constant-yield method\ndescribed above under \u0093\u0097 General\u0094, with the\nmodifications described below.

Your debt security\nwill not have a qualified floating rate,\nhowever, if the rate is subject to certain\nrestrictions (including caps, floors,\ngovernors, or other similar restrictions)\nunless such restrictions are fixed throughout\nthe term of the debt security or are not\nreasonably expected to significantly affect\nthe yield on the debt security. Your debt\nsecurity will have a variable rate that is a\nsingle objective rate if:\n                                              \n      the rate is not a qualified floating    \n      rate; and                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      the rate is determined using a single,  \n      fixed formula that is based on          \n      objective financial or economic         \n      information that is                     \n      not within the control of or unique to  \n      the circumstances of the issuer or a    \n      related party.                          \n                                              \nYour debt security will not have a variable\nrate that is an objective rate, however, if it\nis reasonably expected that the average value\nof the rate during the first half of your debt\nsecurity\u0092s term will be either significantly\nless than or significantly greater than the\naverage value of the rate during the final\nhalf of your debt security\u0092s term. 125\n\nAn objective rate as described above is a\nqualified inverse floating rate if:\n                                              \n      the rate is equal to a fixed rate       \n      minus a qualified floating rate; and    \n                                              \n                                              \n      the variations in the rate can          \n      reasonably be expected to inversely     \n      reflect contemporaneous variations in   \n      the cost of newly                       \n      borrowed funds.                         \n                                              \nYour debt security will also have a single\nqualified floating rate or an objective rate\nif interest on your debt security is stated at\na fixed rate for an initial period of one year\nor less followed by either a qualified\nfloating rate or an objective rate for a\nsubsequent period, and either:\n                                              \n      the fixed rate and the qualified        \n      floating rate or objective rate have    \n      values on the issue date of the debt    \n      security that do                        \n      not differ by more than 0.25            \n      percentage points; or                   \n                                              \n                                              \n      the value of the qualified floating     \n      rate or objective rate is intended to   \n      approximate the fixed rate.             \n                                              \nIn general, if your variable rate debt\nsecurity provides for stated interest at a\nsingle qualified floating rate or objective\nrate, or one of those rates after a single\nfixed rate for an initial period of one year\nor less meeting one of the two requirements\ndescribed above, all stated interest on your\ndebt security is qualified stated interest. In\nthis case, the amount of original issue\ndiscount, if any, is determined by using, in\nthe case of a qualified floating rate or\nqualified inverse floating rate, the value as\nof the issue date of the qualified floating\nrate or qualified inverse floating rate, or,\nfor any other objective rate, a fixed rate\nthat reflects the yield reasonably expected\nfor your debt security. If your variable rate\ndebt security does not provide for stated\ninterest at a single qualified floating rate\nor a single objective rate, and also does not\nprovide for interest payable at a fixed rate\nother than a single fixed rate for an initial\nperiod of one year or less meeting one of the\ntwo requirements described above, you\ngenerally must determine the interest and\noriginal issue discount accruals on your debt\nsecurity by:\n                                              \n      determining a fixed rate substitute     \n      for each variable rate provided under   \n      your variable rate debt security;       \n                                              \n                                              \n      constructing the equivalent fixed rate  \n      debt instrument, using the fixed rate   \n      substitute described above;             \n                                              \n                                              \n      determining the amount of qualified     \n      stated interest and original issue      \n      discount with respect to the            \n      equivalent fixed rate                   \n      debt instrument; and                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      adjusting for actual variable rates     \n      during the applicable accrual period.   \n                                              \nWhen you determine the fixed rate substitute\nfor each variable rate provided under the\nvariable rate debt security, you generally\nwill use the value of each variable rate as of\nthe issue date or, for an objective rate that\nis not a qualified inverse floating rate, a\nrate that reflects the reasonably expected\nyield on your debt security. If your variable\nrate debt security provides for stated\ninterest either at one or more qualified\nfloating rates or at a qualified inverse\nfloating rate, and also provides for stated\ninterest at a single fixed rate other than at\na single fixed rate for an initial period of\none year or less meeting one of the two\nrequirements described above, you generally\nmust determine interest and original issue\ndiscount accruals by using the method\ndescribed in the previous paragraph. However,\nyour variable rate debt security will be\ntreated, for purposes of the first three steps\nof the determination, as if your debt security\nhad provided for a qualified floating rate, or\na qualified inverse floating rate, rather than\nthe fixed rate. The qualified floating rate,\nor qualified inverse floating rate, that\nreplaces the fixed rate must be such that the\nfair market value of your variable rate debt\nsecurity as of the issue date approximates the\nfair market value of an otherwise identical\ndebt instrument that provides for the\nqualified floating rate, or qualified inverse\nfloating rate, rather than the fixed rate. 126\n\nShort-Term Debt Securities\n\nIn general, if you are an individual or other\ncash basis United States holder of a debt\nsecurity with a fixed maturity of one year or\nless, a short-term\ndebt security, you are not required to accrue\noriginal issue discount, as specially defined\nbelow for the purposes of this paragraph, for\nUnited States federal income tax purposes\nunless you elect to do so (although it is\npossible that you may be\nrequired to include any stated interest in\nincome as you receive it). If you are an\naccrual basis taxpayer, a taxpayer in a\nspecial class, including, but not limited to,\na regulated investment company, common trust\nfund, or a certain type of\npass-through entity, or a cash basis taxpayer\nwho so elects, you will be required to accrue\noriginal issue discount on short-term debt\nsecurities on either a straight-line basis or\nunder the constant-yield method, based on\ndaily compounding. If you\nare not required and do not elect to include\noriginal issue discount in income currently,\nany gain you realize on the sale or retirement\nof your short-term debt security will be\nordinary income to the extent of the accrued\noriginal issue discount,\nwhich will be determined on a straight-line\nbasis unless you make an election to accrue\nthe original issue discount under the\nconstant-yield method, through the date of\nsale or retirement. However, if you are not\nrequired and do not elect to accrue\noriginal issue discount on your short-term\ndebt securities, you will be required to defer\ndeductions for interest on borrowings\nallocable to your short-term debt securities\nin an amount not exceeding the deferred income\nuntil the deferred income is\nrealized.\n\nWhen you determine the amount of original\nissue discount subject to these rules, you\nmust include all interest payments on your\nshort-term debt security, including stated\ninterest, in your short-term debt security\u0092s\nstated redemption price at maturity.\n\nNon-U.S.Dollar Currency Original Issue\nDiscount Debt Securities\n\nIf your original issue discount debt\nsecurity is denominated in, or determined by\nreference to, a non-U.S. dollar currency, you\nmust determine original issue discount for any\naccrual period on your original issue discount\ndebt security in the non-U.S. dollar currency\nand then translate the amount of original\nissue discount into U.S. dollars in the same\nmanner as stated interest accrued by an\naccrual basis United States holder, as\ndescribed above under\n\u0093\u0097 Taxation of Debt Securities \u0097 United States\nHolders \u0097 Payments of Interest\u0094. You may\nrecognize ordinary income or loss when you\nreceive an amount attributable to original\nissue discount in connection with a payment of\ninterest or the sale or retirement of your\ndebt security.\n\nMarket Discount\n\nYou will be treated as if you purchased your\ndebt security, other than a short-term debt\nsecurity, at a market discount, and your debt\nsecurity will be a\nmarket discount debt security if the\ndifference between the debt security\u0092s stated\nredemption price at maturity or, in the case\nof an original issue discount debt security,\nthe debt security\u0092s revised issue price, and\nthe price you paid\nfor your debt security is equal to or greater\nthan 0.25 percent of your debt security\u0092s\nstated redemption price at maturity\nmultipliedby the number of complete years to\nthe debt security\u0092s maturity. To determine the\nrevised\nissue price of your debt security for these\npurposes, you generally add any original issue\ndiscount that has accrued on your debt\nsecurity to its issue price.\n\nIf your debt security\u0092s stated redemption\nprice at maturity or, in the case of a\ndiscount debt security, its revised issue\nprice, exceeds the price\nyou paid for the debt security by less than\n0.25 percent of the debt security\u0092s stated\nredemption price at maturity multipliedby the\nnumber of complete years to the debt\nsecurity\u0092s maturity, the excess constitutes de\nminimis\nmarket discount, and the rules discussed below\nare not applicable to you.\n\nYou must treat any gain you recognize on the\nmaturity or disposition of\nyour market discount debt security as ordinary\nincome to the extent of the accrued market\ndiscount on your debt security.\n\n127\n\nAlternatively, you may elect to include market\ndiscount in income currently over the life of\nyour debt security. If you make this election,\nit will apply to all debt instruments with\nmarket discount that you acquire on or after\nthe first day of the first taxable year to\nwhich the election applies. You may not revoke\nthis election without the consent of the\nInternal Revenue Service. If you own a market\ndiscount debt security and do not make this\nelection, you will generally be required to\ndefer deductions for interest on borrowings\nallocable to your debt security in an amount\nnot exceeding the accrued market discount on\nyour debt security until the maturity or\ndisposition of your debt security. If you own\na market discount debt security, the market\ndiscount would accrue on a straight-line basis\nunless an election is made to accrue market\ndiscount using a constant-yield method. If you\nmake this election, it will apply only to the\ndebt security with respect to which it is made\nand you may not revoke it. You will, however,\nnot include accrued market discount in income\nunless you elect to do so as described above.\nDebt Securities Purchased at a Premium If you\npurchase your debt security for an amount in\nexcess of its principal amount (or, in the\ncase of an original issue discount debt\nsecurity, in excess of the sum of all amounts\npayable on the debt security after the\nacquisition date (other than payments of\nqualified stated interest)), you may elect to\ntreat the excess as amortizable bond premium.\nIf you make this election, you will reduce the\namount required to be included in your income\neach accrual period with respect to interest\non your debt security by the amount of\namortizable bond premium allocable to that\naccrual period, based on your debt security\u0092s\nyield to maturity. If the amortizable bond\npremium allocable to an accrual period exceeds\nyour interest income from the debt securities\nfor such accrual period, such excess is first\nallowed as a deduction to the extent of\ninterest included in your income in respect of\nthe debt securities in previous accrual\nperiods and is then carried forward to your\nnext accrual period. If the amortizable bond\npremium allocable and carried forward to the\naccrual period in which the debt securities\nare sold, retired or otherwise disposed of\nexceeds your interest income for such accrual\nperiod, you would be allowed an ordinary\ndeduction equal to such excess. If your debt\nsecurity is denominated in, or determined by\nreference to, a non-U.S.dollar currency, you\nwill compute your amortizable bond premium in\nunits of the non-U.S.dollar currency and your\namortizable bond premium will reduce your\ninterest income in units of the non-U.S.dollar\ncurrency. Gain or loss recognized that is\nattributable to changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates between the time your amortized\nbond premium offsets interest income and the\ntime of the acquisition of your debt security\nis generally taxable as ordinary income or\nloss.

Purchase, Sale and Retirement of\nthe Debt Securities Your tax basis in your\ndebt security will generally be the U.S.\ndollar cost, as defined below, of your debt\nsecurity, adjusted by:\n                                              \n      adding any original issue discount,     \n      market discount, de minimis original    \n      issue discount and de minimis market    \n      discount                                \n      previously included in income with      \n      respect to your debt security; and      \n      then                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      subtracting any payments on your debt   \n      security that are not qualified stated  \n      interest payments and any amortizable   \n      bond                                    \n      premium to the extent that such         \n      premium either reduced interest income  \n      on your debt security or gave rise to   \n      a deduction on your debt security.      \n                                              \n128\n\nIf you purchase your debt security with\nnon-U.S.dollar currency, the U.S. dollar cost\nof your debt security will generally be the\nU.S. dollar value of the purchase price on the\ndate of purchase. However, if you are a cash\nbasis taxpayer, or an accrual basis taxpayer\nif you so elect, and your debt security is\ntraded on an established securities market, as\ndefined in the applicable U.S. Treasury\nregulations, the U.S. dollar cost of your debt\nsecurity will be the U.S. dollar value of the\npurchase price on the settlement date of your\npurchase. You will generally recognize gain or\nloss on the sale or retirement of your debt\nsecurity equal to the difference between the\namount you realize on the sale or retirement,\nexcluding any amounts attributable to accrued\nbut unpaid interest (which will be treated as\ninterest payments), and your tax basis in your\ndebt security. If your debt security is sold\nor retired for an amount in non-U.S.dollar\ncurrency, the amount you realize will be the\nU.S. dollar value of such amount on the date\nthe note is disposed of or retired, except\nthat in the case of a note that is traded on\nan established securities market, as defined\nin the applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, a\ncash basis taxpayer, or an accrual basis\ntaxpayer that so elects, will determine the\namount realized based on the U.S. dollar value\nof the specified currency on the settlement\ndate of the sale. You will recognize capital\ngain or loss when you sell or retire your debt\nsecurity, except to the extent:\n                                              \n      described above under \u0093\u0097 Taxation of      \n      Debt Securities \u0097 United States Holders  \n      \u0097 Short-Term Debt                        \n      Securities\u0094 or \u0093\u0097 Market Discount\u0094; or      \n                                              \n                                              \n      attributable to changes in exchange     \n      rates as described below.               \n                                              \nCapital gain of a non-corporateUnited States\nholder is generally taxed at preferential\nrates where the property is held for more than\none year. You must treat any portion of the\ngain or loss that you recognize on the sale or\nretirement of a debt security as ordinary\nincome or loss to the extent attributable to\nchanges in exchange rates. However, you take\nexchange gain or loss into account only to the\nextent of the total gain or loss you realize\non the transaction. Exchange of Amounts in\nOther Than U.S. Dollars If you receive\nnon-U.S.dollar currency as interest on your\ndebt security or on the sale or retirement of\nyour debt security, your tax basis in the\nnon-U.S.dollar currency will equal its U.S.\ndollar value when the interest is received or\nat the time of the sale or retirement. If you\npurchase non-U.S.dollar currency, you\ngenerally will have a tax basis equal to the\nU.S. dollar value of the non-U.S.dollar\ncurrency on the date of your purchase. If you\nsell or dispose of a non-U.S.dollar currency,\nincluding if you use it to purchase debt\nsecurities or exchange it for U.S. dollars,\nany gain or loss recognized generally will be\nordinary income or loss. Indexed and Other\nDebt Securities The applicable prospectus\nsupplement will discuss the material United\nStates federal income tax rules with respect\nto contingent non-U.S.dollar currency debt\nsecurities, debt securities that may be\nconvertible into or exercisable or\nexchangeable for common or preferred stock or\nother securities of Goldman Sachs or debt or\nequity securities of one or more third\nparties, indexed debt securities (as described\nabove under \u0093Description of Debt Securities We\nMay Offer \u0097 Indexed Debt Securities\u0094), debt\nsecurities that are subject to the rules\ngoverning contingent payment debt instruments,\nrenewable or extendible debt securities and\nany debt securities providing for the periodic\npayment of principal over the life of the debt\nsecurity. 129\n\nNon-UnitedStates Holders This subsection\ndescribes the tax consequences to a Non-\nUnitedStates holder. You are a Non-\nUnitedStates holder if you are the beneficial\nowner of a debt security and are, for United\nStates federal income tax purposes:\n                                       \n      a nonresident alien individual;  \n                                       \n                                 \n      a foreign corporation; or  \n                                 \n                                              \n      an estate or trust that in either case  \n      is not subject to United States         \n      federal income tax on a net income      \n      basis on income                         \n      or gain from a debt security.           \n                                              \nIf you are a United States holder, this\nsubsection does not apply to you. This\ndiscussion assumes that the debt security is\nnot subject to the rules of Section\n871(h)(4)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code,\nrelating to interest payments that are\ndetermined by reference to the income,\nprofits, changes in the value of property or\nother attributes of the debtor or a related\nparty.

For individuals and\ntrusts, this loss threshold is $50,000 in any\nsingle taxable year. For\nother types of taxpayers and other types of\nlosses, the thresholds are higher. You should\nconsult with your tax advisor regarding any\ntax filing and reporting obligations that may\napply in connection with acquiring, owning and\ndisposing of debt\nsecurities.\n\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\n\nUnited States Holders\n\nIn general, if you are a\nnoncorporate United States holder, we and\nother payors are required to report to the\nInternal Revenue Service all payments of\nprincipal, any premium and interest on your\ndebt security, and the accrual of original\nissue discount on an original issue\ndiscount debt security. In addition, we and\nother payors are required to report to the\nInternal Revenue Service any payment of\nproceeds of the sale of your debt security\nbefore maturity within the United States.\nAdditionally, backup withholding will\napply to any payments, including payments of\noriginal issue discount, if you fail to\nprovide an accurate taxpayer identification\nnumber, or (in the case of interest payments)\nyou are notified by the Internal Revenue\nService that you have failed to\nreport all interest and dividends required to\nbe shown on your federal income tax returns.\n\nYou generally may obtain a refund of any\namounts\nwithheld under the U.S. backup withholding\nrules that exceed your income tax liability by\nfiling a refund claim with the Internal\nRevenue Service.\n\nNon-UnitedStates Holders\n\nIn general, if you are a Non-United\nStates holder, payments of principal, premium\nor interest, including original issue\ndiscount, made by us and other payors to you\nwill not be subject to backup withholding and\ninformation reporting, provided that the\ncertification requirements\ndescribed above under \u0093\u0097 Taxation of Debt\nSecurities \u0097 Non-United States Holders\u0094 are\nsatisfied or you otherwise establish an\nexemption. However, we and other payors are\nrequired to report\npayments of interest on your debt securities,\nincluding original issue discount, on Internal\nRevenue Service Form 1042-S even if the\npayments are not otherwise subject to\ninformation reporting requirements. In\naddition, payment of the proceeds from the\nsale of debt securities effected at a United\nStates office of a broker will not be subject\nto backup withholding and information\nreporting if you have furnished to the payor\nor broker an appropriate\nInternal Revenue Service Form W-8, an\nacceptable substitute form or other\ndocumentation upon which it may rely to treat\nthe payment as made to a non-United States\nperson.\n\nIn general, payment of the proceeds from the\nsale of debt securities effected at a foreign\noffice of a broker will not be subject to\ninformation reporting or backup withholding.\nHowever, a sale effected at a foreign office\nof a broker could be subject to information\nreporting in the same manner as a sale within\nthe United States (and in certain cases may be\nsubject to backup\nwithholding as well) if (i) the broker has\ncertain connections to the United States, (ii)\nthe proceeds or confirmation are sent to the\nUnited States or (iii) the sale has certain\nother specified connections with the United\nStates.\n\nYou generally may obtain a refund of any\namounts withheld under the backup withholding\nrules that exceed your income tax liability by\nfiling a\nrefund claim with the Internal Revenue\nService.\n\n132\n\nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)\nWithholding\n\nA U.S. law enacted in 2010 (commonly known as\n\u0093FATCA\u0094) could impose a withholding tax of 30%\non interest income (including original issue\ndiscount) and other periodic payments on debt\nsecurities paid to you or any non-U.S. person\nor entity that receives such income (a\n\u0093non-U.S. payee\u0094) on your\nbehalf, unless you and each such non-U.S.\npayee in the payment chain comply with the\napplicable information reporting, account\nidentification, withholding, certification and\nother FATCA-related requirements.\nIn the case of a payee that is a non-U.S.\nfinancial institution (for example, a clearing\nsystem, custodian, nominee or broker),\nwithholding generally will not be imposed if\nthe financial institution complies\nwith the requirements imposed by FATCA to\ncollect and report (to the U.S. or another\nrelevant taxing authority) substantial\ninformation regarding such institution\u0092s U.S.\naccount holders (which would include some\naccount holders that are non-U.S. entities but\nhave U.S. owners). Other payees, including\nindividuals, may be required to provide proof\nof tax residence or waivers of confidentiality\nlaws and/or, in the case of non-U.S. entities,\ncertification or information relating to their\nU.S. ownership.\n\nWithholding may be imposed at\nany point in a chain of payments if the payee\nis not compliant. A chain may work as follows,\nfor example: The payment is transferred\nthrough a paying agent to a clearing system,\nthe clearing system makes a payment to each of\nthe clearing\nsystem\u0092s participants, and finally the\nclearing system participant makes a payment to\na non-U.S. bank or broker through which you\nhold the debt securities, who credits the\npayment to your account.\nAccordingly, if you receive payments through a\nchain that includes one or more non-U.S.\npayees, such as a non-U.S. bank or broker, the\npayment could be subject to\nwithholding if, for example, your non-U.S.\nbank or broker through which you hold the debt\nsecurities fails to comply with the FATCA\nrequirements and is subject to withholding.\nThis would be the case even if\nyou would not otherwise have been directly\nsubject to withholding.\n\nA number of countries have entered into, and\nother countries are expected to\nenter into, agreements with the U.S. to\nfacilitate the type of information reporting\nrequired under FATCA. While the existence of\nsuch agreements will not eliminate the risk\nthat debt securities will be subject to the\nwithholding described above,\nthese agreements are expected to reduce the\nrisk of the withholding for investors in (or\ninvestors that indirectly hold debt securities\nthrough financial institutions in) those\ncountries.\n\nThe withholding tax described above could\napply to all interest, including original\nissue discount, and other periodic payments on\nthe debt securities.\nWe will not pay any additional amounts in\nrespect of this withholding tax, so if this\nwithholding applies, you will receive less\nthan the amount that you would have otherwise\nreceived.\n\nDepending on your circumstances, you may be\nentitled to a refund or credit in respect of\nsome or all of this withholding. However, even\nif you are\nentitled to have any such withholding\nrefunded, the required procedures could be\ncumbersome and significantly delay your\nreceipt of any withheld amounts. You should\nconsult your own tax advisors regarding FATCA.\nYou should also consult your bank or\nbroker through which you would hold the debt\nsecurities about the likelihood that payments\nto it (for credit to you) may become subject\nto withholding in the payment chain.\n\nIn addition, your debt securities may also be\nsubject to other U.S. withholding tax as\ndescribed herein.\n\nTaxation of Preferred Stock and Depositary\nShares\n\nThis subsection describes the material United\nStates federal income tax consequences of\nowning, selling and disposing of the preferred\nstock and\ndepositary shares that we may offer other than\n\n133\n\npreferred stock that may be convertible into\nor exercisable or exchangeable for securities\nor other property, which will be described in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement. When we\nrefer to preferred stock in this subsection,\nwe mean both preferred stock and depositary\nshares. United States Holders This subsection\ndescribes the tax consequences to a United\nStates holder. You are a United States holder\nif you are a beneficial owner of a share of\npreferred stock and you are:\n                                              \n      a citizen or resident of the United     \n      States;                                 \n                                              \n                               \n      a domestic corporation;  \n                               \n                                              \n      an estate whose income is subject to    \n      United States federal income tax        \n      regardless of its source; or            \n                                              \n                                              \n      a trust if a United States court can    \n      exercise primary supervision over the   \n      trust\u0092s administration and one or more   \n      United States persons are authorized    \n      to control all substantial decisions    \n      of the trust.                           \n                                              \nIf you are not a United States holder, this\nsubsection does not apply to you and you\nshould refer to \u0093\u0097 Non-UnitedStates Holders\u0094\nbelow. Distributions on Preferred Stock You\nwill be taxed on distributions on preferred\nstock as dividend income to the extent paid\nout of our current or accumulated earnings and\nprofits for United States federal income tax\npurposes. If you are a non-corporateUnited\nStates holder, dividends paid to you will\ngenerally be \u0093qualified dividends\u0094 that are\ntaxable to you at a maximum preferential rate\nof 20%, provided that you hold your shares of\npreferred stock for more than 60 days during\nthe 121-dayperiod beginning 60 days before the\nex-dividenddate (or, if the dividend is\nattributable to a period or periods\naggregating over 366 days, provided that you\nhold your shares of preferred stock for more\nthan 90 days during the 181-dayperiod\nbeginning 90 days before the ex-dividenddate)\nand meet other holding periods requirements.\nIf you are taxed as a corporation, except as\ndescribed in the next subsection, dividends\nwould be eligible for the 50% dividends-\nreceived deduction. You generally will not be\ntaxed on any portion of a distribution not\npaid out of our current or accumulated\nearnings and profits if your tax basis in the\npreferred stock is greater than or equal to\nthe amount of the distribution. However, you\nwould be required to reduce your tax basis\n(but not below zero) in the preferred stock by\nthe amount of the distribution, and would\nrecognize capital gain to the extent that the\ndistribution exceeds your tax basis in the\npreferred stock. Further, if you are a\ncorporation, you would not be entitled to a\ndividends-received deduction on this portion\nof a distribution. Limitations on Dividends-\nReceived Deduction Corporate shareholders may\nnot be entitled to take the 50% dividends-\nreceived deduction in all circumstances.\nProspective corporate investors in preferred\nstock should consider the effect of:\n                                              \n      Section\u00a0246A of the Internal Revenue    \n      Code, which reduces the                 \n      dividends-received deduction allowed    \n      to a corporate                          \n      shareholder that has incurred           \n      indebtedness that is \u0093directly           \n      attributable\u0094 to an investment in        \n      portfolio stock such as preferred       \n      stock;                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      Section\u00a0246(c) of the Internal Revenue  \n      Code, which, among other things,        \n      disallows the dividends-received        \n      deduction in                            \n      respect of any dividend on a share of   \n      stock that is held for                  \n                                              \n134\n                                              \n  less than the minimum holding period        \n  (generally at least 46 days during the      \n  90-day period beginning on the date which   \n  is 45 days before the date on which         \n  such share becomes ex-dividend with         \n  respect to such dividend (or, if the        \n  dividend is attributable to a period or     \n  periods aggregating over 366 days, at       \n  least 91 days during the                    \n  180-day period beginning on the date which  \n  is 90 days before the date on which such    \n  share becomes ex-dividend with respect to   \n  such dividend)); and                        \n                                              \n                                              \n      Section\u00a01059 of the Internal Revenue    \n      Code, which, under certain              \n      circumstances (including situations     \n      where preferred                         \n      stock is issued at a premium), reduces  \n      the basis of stock for purposes of      \n      calculating gain or loss in a           \n      subsequent disposition by the portion   \n      of any \u0093extraordinary dividend\u0094 (as       \n      defined below) that is eligible for     \n      the dividends-received                  \n      deduction.                              \n                                              \nExtraordinary Dividends If you are a corporate\nshareholder, you will be required to reduce\nyour tax basis (but not below zero) in the\npreferred stock by the non-taxedportion of any\n\u0093extraordinary dividend\u0094 if you have not held\nyour stock for more than two years before the\nearliest of the date such dividend is\ndeclared, announced, or agreed. Generally, the\nnon-taxedportion of an extraordinary dividend\nis the amount excluded from income by\noperation of the dividends-received deduction.\nAn extraordinary dividend on the preferred\nstock generally would be a dividend that:\n                                              \n      equals or exceeds 5% of the corporate   \n      shareholder\u0092s adjusted tax basis in the  \n      preferred stock, treating all           \n      dividends                               \n      having ex-dividend dates within an 85   \n      day period as one dividend; or          \n                                              \n                                              \n      exceeds 20% of the corporate            \n      shareholder\u0092s adjusted tax basis in the  \n      preferred stock, treating all           \n      dividends having ex-dividend dates      \n      within a 365 day period as one          \n      dividend.                               \n                                              \nIn determining whether a dividend paid on the\npreferred stock is an extraordinary dividend,\na corporate shareholder may elect to\nsubstitute the fair market value of the stock\nfor its tax basis for purposes of applying\nthese tests if the fair market value as of the\nday before the ex-dividenddate is established\nto the satisfaction of the Secretary of the\nTreasury. An extraordinary dividend also\nincludes any amount treated as a dividend in\nthe case of a redemption that is either non-\nprorata as to all stockholders or in partial\nliquidation of the company, regardless of the\nstockholder\u0092s holding period and regardless of\nthe size of the dividend. Any part of the non-\ntaxedportion of an extraordinary dividend that\nis not applied to reduce the corporate\nshareholder\u0092s tax basis as a result of the\nlimitation on reducing its basis below zero\nwould be treated as capital gain and would be\nrecognized in the taxable year in which the\nextraordinary dividend is received. If you are\na corporate shareholder, please consult your\ntax advisor with respect to the possible\napplication of the extraordinary dividend\nprovisions of the federal income tax law to\nyour ownership or disposition of preferred\nstock in your particular circumstances.\nRedemption Premium If we may redeem your\npreferred stock at a redemption price in\nexcess of its issue price, the entire amount\nof the excess may constitute an unreasonable\nredemption premium which will be treated as a\nconstructive dividend. You generally must take\nthis constructive dividend into account each\nyear in the same manner as original issue\ndiscount would be taken into account if the\npreferred stock were treated as an original\nissue discount debt security for United States\nfederal income tax purposes. See \u0093\u0097 Taxation\nof Debt Securities \u0097 United States Holders \u0097\nOriginal Issue Discount \u0097 General\u0094 above for a\ndiscussion of the special tax rules for\noriginal issue discount. A corporate\nshareholder would be 135\n\nentitled to a dividends-received deduction for\nany constructive dividends unless the special\nrules denying a dividends-received deduction\ndescribed above in \u0093\u0097 Limitations on\nDividends-Received Deduction\u0094 apply. A\ncorporate shareholder would also be required\nto take these constructive dividends into\naccount when applying the extraordinary\ndividend rules described above. Thus, a\ncorporate shareholder\u0092s receipt of a\nconstructive dividend may cause some or all\nstated dividends to be treated as\nextraordinary dividends. The applicable\nprospectus supplement for preferred stock that\nis redeemable at a price in excess of its\nissue price will indicate whether tax counsel\nbelieves that a shareholder must include any\nredemption premium in income. Sale or Exchange\nof Preferred Stock Other Than by Redemption If\nyou sell or otherwise dispose of your\npreferred stock (other than by redemption),\nyou will generally recognize capital gain or\nloss equal to the difference between the\namount realized upon the disposition and your\nadjusted tax basis of the preferred stock.\nCapital gain of a non-corporateUnited States\nholder is generally taxed at preferential\nrates where the property is held for more than\none year. Redemption of Preferred Stock If we\nare permitted to and redeem your preferred\nstock, it generally would be a taxable event.\nYou would be treated as if you had sold your\npreferred stock if the redemption:\n                                              \n      results in a complete termination of    \n      your stock interest in us;              \n                                              \n                                              \n      is substantially disproportionate with  \n      respect to you; or                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      is not essentially equivalent to a      \n      dividend with respect to you.           \n                                              \nIn determining whether any of these tests has\nbeen met, under certain circumstances, shares\nof stock considered to be owned by you by\nreason of certain constructive ownership rules\nset forth in Section 318 of the Internal\nRevenue Code, as well as shares actually\nowned, must be taken into account. If we\nredeem your preferred stock in a redemption\nthat meets one of the tests described above,\nyou generally would recognize taxable gain or\nloss equal to the sum of the amount of cash\nand fair market value of property (other than\nstock of us or a successor to us) received by\nyou less your tax basis in the preferred stock\nredeemed. This gain or loss would be long-term\ncapital gain or capital loss if you have held\nthe preferred stock for more than one year. If\na redemption does not meet any of the tests\ndescribed above, you generally would be taxed\non the cash and fair market value of the\nproperty you receive as a dividend to the\nextent paid out of our current and accumulated\nearnings and profits. Any amount in excess of\nour current or accumulated earnings and\nprofits would first reduce your tax basis in\nthe preferred stock and thereafter would be\ntreated as capital gain. If a redemption of\nthe preferred stock is treated as a\ndistribution that is taxable as a dividend,\nyour basis in the redeemed preferred stock\nwould be transferred to the remaining shares\nof our stock that you own, if any. Special\nrules apply if we redeem preferred stock for\nour debt securities. We will discuss these\nrules in an applicable prospectus supplement\nif we have the option to redeem your preferred\nstock for our debt securities. Non-\nUnitedStates Holders This section summarizes\ncertain United States federal income and\nestate tax consequences of the ownership and\ndisposition of preferred stock by a Non-\nUnitedStates holder.

Even if\nyou are eligible for a lower treaty rate, we\nand other payors will generally be required to\nwithhold at a 30% rate (rather than the lower\ntreaty rate) on dividend payments to you,\nunless you have furnished to us or another\npayor:\n                                              \n      a valid Internal Revenue Service Form   \n      W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E or an acceptable     \n      substitute form upon which you          \n      certify, under penalties of perjury,    \n      your status as a person who is not a    \n      United States person and your           \n      entitlement to the lower treaty rate    \n      with                                    \n      respect to such payments; or            \n                                              \n                                              \n      in the case of payments made outside    \n      the United States to an offshore        \n      account (generally, an account          \n      maintained by you at                    \n      an office or branch of a bank or other  \n      financial institution at any location   \n      outside the United States), other       \n      documentary evidence establishing your  \n      entitlement to the lower treaty rate    \n      in accordance with U.S. Treasury        \n      regulations.                            \n                                              \nIf you are eligible for a reduced rate of\nUnited States withholding tax under a tax\ntreaty, you may obtain a refund of any amounts\nwithheld in excess of that rate by filing a\nrefund claim with the Internal Revenue\nService.

We have not been, are not\nand do not anticipate becoming a United States\nreal property holding corporation for United\nStates federal income tax purposes. Federal\nEstate Taxes Preferred stock held by a Non-\nUnitedStates holder at the time of death will\nbe included in the holder\u0092s gross estate for\nUnited States federal estate tax purposes,\nunless an applicable estate tax treaty\nprovides otherwise. Backup Withholding and\nInformation Reporting United States Holders In\ngeneral, if you are a noncorporate United\nStates holder, information reporting\nrequirements, on Internal Revenue Service Form\n1099, will apply to dividend payments or other\ntaxable distributions made to you, and the\npayment of proceeds to you from the sale of\npreferred stock effected at a U.S. office of a\nbroker. Additionally, backup withholding may\napply to such payments if you fail to comply\nwith applicable certification requirements or\n(in the case of dividend payments) are\nnotified by the Internal Revenue Service that\nyou have failed to report all interest and\ndividends required to be shown on your federal\nincome tax returns. You generally may obtain a\nrefund of any amounts withheld under the\nbackup withholding rules that exceed your\nincome tax liability by filing a refund claim\nwith the Internal Revenue Service. Non-\nUnitedStates Holders If you are a Non-\nUnitedStates holder, we and other payors are\nrequired to report payments of dividends on\nInternal Revenue Service Form 1042-Seven if\nthe payments are exempt from withholding. You\nare otherwise generally exempt from backup\nwithholding and information reporting\nrequirements with respect to dividend payments\nand the payment of the proceeds from the sale\nof preferred stock effected at a United States\noffice of a broker provided that either (i)\nthe payor or broker does not have actual\nknowledge or reason to know that you are a\nUnited States person and you have furnished a\nvalid Internal Revenue Service Form W-8or\nother documentation upon which the payor or\nbroker may rely to treat the payments as made\nto a non-UnitedStates person, or (ii) you\notherwise establish an exemption. Payment of\nthe proceeds from the sale of preferred stock\neffected at a foreign office of a broker\ngenerally will not be subject to information\nreporting or backup withholding. However, a\nsale effected at a foreign office of a broker\ncould be subject to information reporting in\nthe same manner as a sale within the United\nStates (and in certain cases may be subject to\nbackup withholding as well) if (i) the broker\nhas certain connections to the United States,\n(ii) the proceeds or confirmation are sent to\nthe United States or (iii) the sale has\ncertain other specified connections with the\nUnited States. 138\n\nYou generally may obtain a refund of any\namounts withheld under the backup withholding\nrules that\nexceed your income tax liability by filing a\nrefund claim with the Internal Revenue\nService.\n\nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)\nWithholding\n\nA U.S. law enacted in 2010 (commonly known as\n\u0093FATCA\u0094) could impose a withholding tax of 30%\non dividend income and other\nperiodic payments on the preferred stock paid\nto you or any non-U.S. person or entity that\nreceives such income (a \u0093non-U.S. payee\u0094) on\nyour behalf, unless you\nand each such non-U.S. payee in the payment\nchain comply with the applicable information\nreporting, account identification,\nwithholding, certification and other FATCA-\nrelated requirements. In the case of a\npayee that is a non-U.S. financial institution\n(for example, a clearing system, custodian,\nnominee or broker), withholding generally will\nnot be imposed if the financial institution\ncomplies with the\nrequirements imposed by FATCA to collect and\nreport (to the U.S. or another relevant taxing\nauthority) substantial information regarding\nsuch institution\u0092s U.S. account holders (which\nwould include some account holders that are\nnon-U.S. entities but have U.S. owners). Other\npayees, including individuals, may be required\nto provide proof of tax residence or waivers\nof confidentiality laws and/or, in the case of\nnon-U.S. entities, certification or\ninformation relating to their U.S. ownership.\n\nWithholding may be imposed at\nany point in a chain of payments if the payee\nis not compliant. A chain may work as follows,\nfor example: The payment is transferred\nthrough a paying agent to a clearing system,\nthe clearing system makes a payment to each of\nthe clearing\nsystem\u0092s participants, and finally the\nclearing system participant makes a payment to\na non-U.S. bank or broker through which you\nhold the preferred stock, who credits the\npayment to your account.\nAccordingly, if you receive payments through a\nchain that includes one or more non-U.S.\npayees, such as a non-U.S. bank or broker, the\npayment could be subject to\nwithholding if, for example, your non-U.S.\nbank or broker through which you hold the\npreferred stock fails to comply with the FATCA\nrequirements and is subject to withholding.\nThis would be the case even if\nyou would not otherwise have been directly\nsubject to withholding.\n\nA number of countries have entered into, and\nother countries are expected to\nenter into, agreements with the U.S. to\nfacilitate the type of information reporting\nrequired under FATCA. While the existence of\nsuch agreements will not eliminate the risk\nthat the preferred stock will be subject to\nthe withholding described\nabove, these agreements are expected to reduce\nthe risk of the withholding for investors in\n(or investors that indirectly hold the\npreferred stock through financial institutions\nin) those countries.\n\nThe withholding tax described above could\napply to all dividends on the preferred stock.\nWe will not pay any additional amounts in\nrespect of this\nwithholding tax, so if this withholding\napplies, you will receive less than the amount\nthat you would have otherwise received.\n\nDepending on your\ncircumstances, you may be entitled to a refund\nor credit in respect of some or all of this\nwithholding. However, even if you are entitled\nto have any such withholding refunded, the\nrequired procedures could be cumbersome and\nsignificantly delay your\nreceipt of any withheld amounts. You should\nconsult your own tax advisors regarding FATCA.\nYou should also consult your bank or broker\nthrough which you would hold the preferred\nstock about the likelihood that payments to it\n(for credit to you) may\nbecome subject to withholding in the payment\nchain.\n\nIn addition, your preferred stock may also be\nsubject to other U.S. withholding tax as\ndescribed herein.\n\n139\n\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION Initial Offering and Sale\nof Securities We may sell the securities from\ntime to time in their initial offering as\nfollows:\n                       \n      through agents;  \n                       \n                                              \n      to dealers or underwriters for resale;  \n                                              \n                                  \n      directly to purchasers; or  \n                                  \n                                              \n      through a combination of any of these   \n      methods of sale.                        \n                                              \nIn addition, we may issue the securities as a\ndividend or distribution or in a subscription\nrights offering to our existing security\nholders.

We may also\ndesignate agents from\ntime to time to\nsolicit offers to\npurchase securities\nfrom the public on our\nbehalf. If required,\nthe prospectus\nsupplement relating to\nany particular\noffering of securities\nwill name any agents\ndesignated to solicit\noffers, and will\ninclude information\nabout any commissions\nwe may pay the agents,\nin that offering.\nAgents may be deemed\nto be \u0093underwriters\u0094\nas that term is\ndefined in the\nSecurities Act of 1933\n(the \u0093Securities\nAct\u0094). From time to\ntime, we may sell\nsecurities to one or\nmore dealers acting as\nprincipals. The\ndealers, who may be\ndeemed to be\n\u0093underwriters\u0094 as that\nterm is defined in the\nSecurities Act, may\nthen resell those\nsecurities to the\npublic. We may sell\nsecurities from time\nto time to one or more\nunderwriters, who\nwould purchase the\nsecurities as\nprincipal for resale\nto the public, either\non a firm-commitment\nor best-efforts basis.\nIf we sell securities\nto underwriters, we\nmay execute an\nunderwriting agreement\nwith them at the time\nof sale and will name\nthem in the applicable\nprospectus supplement.\nIn connection with\nthose sales,\nunderwriters may be\ndeemed to have\nreceived compensation\nfrom us in the form of\nunderwriting discounts\nor commissions and may\nalso receive\ncommissions from\npurchasers of the\nsecurities for whom\nthey may act as\nagents. Underwriters\nmay resell the\nsecurities to or\nthrough dealers, and\nthose dealers may\nreceive compensation\nin the form of\ndiscounts, concessions\nor commissions from\nthe underwriters\nand/or commissions\nfrom purchasers for\nwhom they may act as\nagents. The applicable\nprospectus supplement\nwill include any\nrequired information\nabout underwriting\ncompensation we pay to\nunderwriters, and any\ndiscounts, concessions\nor commissions\nunderwriters allow to\nparticipating dealers,\nin connection with an\noffering of\nsecurities. If we\noffer securities in a\nsubscription rights\noffering to our\nexisting security\nholders, we may enter\ninto a standby\nunderwriting agreement\nwith dealers, acting\nas standby\nunderwriters. We may\npay the standby\nunderwriters a\ncommitment fee for the\nsecurities they commit\nto purchase on a\nstandby basis. 140\n\nIf we do not enter\ninto a standby\nunderwriting\narrangement, we may\nretain a dealer-\nmanager to manage a\nsubscription rights\noffering for us.\n\nWe may authorize\nunderwriters, dealers\nand agents to solicit\nfrom third parties\noffers to purchase\nsecurities\nunder contracts\nproviding for payment\nand delivery on future\ndates. The applicable\nprospectus supplement\nwill describe the\nmaterial terms of\nthese contracts,\nincluding any\nconditions to the\npurchasers\u0092\nobligations, and will\ninclude any required\ninformation about\ncommissions we may pay\nfor soliciting these\ncontracts.\n\nUnderwriters, dealers,\nagents and other\npersons may be\nentitled, under\nagreements that they\nmay enter into with\nus, to indemnification\nby us, against certain\nliabilities, including\nliabilities under the\nSecurities Act.\n\nIn connection with an\noffering, the\nunderwriters may\npurchase and sell\nsecurities in the open\nmarket. These\ntransactions may\ninclude short sales,\nstabilizing\ntransactions and\npurchases to cover\npositions created by\nshort sales. Short\nsales involve the sale\nby the underwriters of\na greater number of\nsecurities than they\nare required to\npurchase in an\noffering. Stabilizing\ntransactions consist\nof certain bids or\npurchases made for the\npurpose of preventing\nor retarding a decline\nin the market price of\nthe securities while\nan offering is in\nprogress.\n\nThe underwriters also\nmay impose a penalty\nbid. This occurs when\na particular\nunderwriter repays to\nthe underwriters a\nportion of the\nunderwriting\ndiscount received by\nit because the\nunderwriters have\nrepurchased securities\nsold by or for the\naccount of that\nunderwriter in\nstabilizing or short-\ncovering transactions.\n\nThese activities by\nthe underwriters may\nstabilize, maintain or\notherwise affect the\nmarket price of the\nsecurities. As a\nresult, the price of\nthe\nsecurities may be\nhigher than the price\nthat otherwise might\nexist in the open\nmarket. If these\nactivities are\ncommenced, they may be\ndiscontinued by the\nunderwriters at any\ntime. These\ntransactions may be\neffected on an\nexchange or automated\nquotation system, if\nthe securities are\nlisted on that\nexchange or admitted\nfor trading on that\nautomated quotation\nsystem, or in the\nover-the-counter\nmarket or\notherwise.\n\nThe underwriters,\ndealers and agents, as\nwell as their\nassociates, may be\ncustomers of or\nlenders to, and may\nengage in transactions\nwith and perform\nservices for, The\nGoldman Sachs Group,\nInc. and its\nsubsidiaries in the\nordinary course of\nbusiness.

This summary does not contain\nall the information that you should consider\nbefore investing in the securities being\noffered by this prospectus. You should\ncarefully read the entire prospectus, the\ndocuments incorporated by reference into this\nprospectus, the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, if applicable, and the prospectus\nsupplement relating to the securities that\nyou propose to buy, especially any\ndescription of investment risks that we may\ninclude in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement.\n\nGS Finance Corp.\n\nGS Finance Corp. is a Delaware corporation\nand a wholly owned subsidiary of The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc., created for the primary\npurpose of providing\nGoldman Sachs with financing for its\noperations by issuing securities to investors\nand lending the net proceeds therefrom to The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. and/or its\nsubsidiaries.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\n\nThe Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. is a leading global\ninvestment banking, securities and investment\nmanagement firm that provides a wide range of\nfinancial services to a substantial and\ndiversified client base that includes\ncorporations, financial institutions,\ngovernments and individuals. Founded in 1869,\nthe Firm is headquartered in New York and\nmaintains offices in all major financial\ncenters around the world. The Firm\u0092s\nprincipal executive offices are located at\n200 West Street, New York, New York\n10282, telephone (212) 902-1000. The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. is a bank holding company\nand a financial holding company regulated by\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (the \u0093Federal\nReserve Board\u0094). The Firm\u0092s U.S. depository\ninstitution subsidiary, Goldman Sachs Bank\nUSA, is a New York State-chartered bank.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a Holding\nCompany\n\nBecause the assets of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. consist principally of interests\nin the\nsubsidiaries through which The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. conducts its businesses, its\nright to participate as an equity holder in\nany distribution of assets of any of its\nsubsidiaries upon the subsidiary\u0092s\nliquidation or otherwise, and thus the\nability of the security holders of GS Finance\nCorp., as the beneficiaries of the guarantee\nby The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., to benefit\nfrom the distribution, is junior to creditors\nof the subsidiary, except to the extent that\nany claims The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. may have as a creditor of\nthe subsidiary are recognized. In addition,\ndividends, loans and advances to The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. from some of its\nsubsidiaries, including Goldman Sachs & Co.\nLLC\n(\u0093GS&Co.\u0094), are restricted by net capital\nrequirements under the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934 and under rules of securities\nexchanges and other regulatory bodies.\nFurthermore, because some of the subsidiaries\nof The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc., including from time to time some\nof The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s principal\noperating subsidiaries, are partnerships in\nwhich The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a\ngeneral partner or the sole limited partner,\nThe Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. may be liable for their\nobligations. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nalso guarantees many of the obligations of\nits subsidiaries other than GS Finance Corp.\nAny liability The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nmay have for its subsidiaries\u0092\nobligations could reduce its assets that are\navailable to satisfy its guarantee\nobligations to the investors in securities of\nGS Finance Corp.\n\n4\n\nThe Securities We Are Offering We may offer\nany of the following securities from time to\ntime:\n                        \n      debt securities;  \n                        \n                     \n      warrants; and  \n                     \n                                              \n      units, comprised of (i)\u00a0one or more     \n      debt securities or warrants described   \n      in this prospectus or (ii)\u00a0any of the   \n      foregoing and debt or equity            \n      securities of The Goldman Sachs Group,  \n      Inc.                                    \n                                              \nThe securities we offer from time to time\nwill be fully and unconditionally guaranteed\nby The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. When we use\nthe term \u0093security\u0094 or \u0093securities\u0094 in this\nprospectus, we mean any of the securities we\nmay offer with this prospectus, including the\nguarantee of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.,\nunless the context requires otherwise. This\nprospectus, including the following summary,\ndescribes the general terms that may apply to\nthe securities; the specific terms of any\nparticular securities that we may offer will\nbe described in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement to this prospectus and may differ\nfrom the general terms described herein. Debt\nSecurities The debt securities may be senior\nor subordinated in right of payment. For any\nparticular debt securities we offer, the\napplicable prospectus supplement will\ndescribe the title and series of the debt\nsecurities, the aggregate principal amount\nand the original issue price; the ranking,\nwhether senior or subordinated; the stated\nmaturity; the redemption terms, if any; the\nrate or manner of calculating the rate and\nthe payment dates for interest, if any; the\namount or manner of calculating the amount\npayable at maturity; and any other specific\nterms.

The\npayment of principal of, and any interest and\npremium on, the debt securities we may offer\nwill be fully and unconditionally guaranteed\nby The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. The\nguarantee will remain in effect until the\nentire principal of, and interest and\npremium, if any, on the debt securities has\nbeen paid in full or discharged in accordance\nwith the provisions of the relevant\nindenture, or otherwise fully defeased by us\nor by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. The\nguarantee of senior debt securities of GS\nFinance Corp. will rank equally in right of\npayment with all senior indebtedness of The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., whereas the\nguarantee of subordinated debt securities of\nGS Finance Corp. will be subordinate and\njunior in right of payment to all senior\nindebtedness of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nWarrants We may offer warrants whose cash\nvalue is determined by reference to the\nperformance, level or value of one or more of\nthe following:\n                                              \n      securities of one or more issuers,      \n      including the common or preferred       \n      stock or other securities of The        \n      Goldman Sachs Group,                    \n      Inc. or debt or equity securities of    \n      third parties;                          \n                                              \n5\n                               \n      one or more currencies;  \n                               \n                                              \n      any other financial, economic or other  \n      measure or instrument, including the    \n      occurrence or                           \n      non-occurrence of any event or          \n      circumstance;                           \n                                              \n                                   \n      one or more indices; and/or  \n                                   \n                                              \n      one or more baskets of the items        \n      described above.                        \n                                              \nFor any particular warrants we offer, the\napplicable prospectus supplement will\ndescribe the underlying property; the\nexpiration date; the exercise price or the\nmanner of determining the exercise price; the\namount in cash, or the manner of determining\nthe amount in cash, to be paid by you or us\nupon exercise; and any other specific terms.\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, the warrants will be\nissued under a warrant indenture (as defined\nherein) among us, The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc., as guarantor, and The Bank of New York\nMellon, as trustee. The payment on the\nwarrants we may offer will be fully and\nunconditionally guaranteed by The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. The guarantee will remain\nin effect until the entire payment, if any,\non the warrants has been paid in full or\ndischarged in accordance with the provisions\nof the warrant indenture. Units We may offer\nunits, comprised of one or more debt\nsecurities or warrants described in this\nprospectus, as well as debt or equity\nsecurities of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nFor any particular units we offer, the\napplicable prospectus supplement will\ndescribe the particular securities comprising\neach unit; the terms on which those\nsecurities will be separable, if any; whether\nthe holder will pledge property to secure the\nperformance of any obligations the holder may\nhave under the unit; and any other specific\nterms of the units. We may issue the units\nunder unit agreements between us and one or\nmore unit agents. The payment of principal\nof, any interest, premium, dividends,\nliquidation preference, sinking fund payment\nor any other applicable payment on our own\nsecurities included in the units we may offer\nwill be fully and unconditionally guaranteed\nby The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. The\nguarantee will remain in effect until the\nentire applicable payment, if any, on our own\nsecurities included in the units has been\npaid in full or discharged in accordance with\nthe provisions of the related debt indenture,\nwarrant indenture or guarantee agreement or\notherwise fully defeased by us or by The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., if applicable.\nReferences to our securities include our\nunits, even though our units may include\nsecurities of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nForm of Securities We will issue the\nsecurities in book-entry form through one or\nmore depositaries, such as The Depository\nTrust Company, Euroclear or Clearstream,\nnamed in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. Each sale of a security in book-\nentry form will settle in immediately\navailable funds through the applicable\ndepositary, unless otherwise stated. We will\nissue the securities only in registered form,\nwithout coupons. Payment Currencies Amounts\npayable in respect of the securities,\nincluding the original issue price, will be\npayable in U.S. dollars, unless the\napplicable prospectus supplement says\notherwise.\n\n6\n\nListing\n\nIf any securities are to be listed or quoted\non a securities exchange or quotation system,\nthe applicable prospectus supplement will say\nso.\n\nUse of Proceeds\n\nWe will lend the net proceeds from\nsales of the securities to The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries.

Under the orderly liquidation\nauthority, the FDIC may be\nappointed as receiver for a financial company\nfor purposes of liquidating the entity if,\nupon the recommendation of applicable\nregulators, the Secretary of the Treasury\ndetermines, among other things, that the\nentity is in severe financial distress,\nthat the entity\u0092s failure would have serious\nadverse effects on the U.S. financial system\nand that resolution under the orderly\nliquidation authority would avoid or mitigate\nthose effects. Absent such determinations,\nGroup Inc., as a U.S. bank\nholding company, would remain subject to the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n\nIf the FDIC is appointed as receiver under\nthe orderly liquidation authority,\nthen the orderly liquidation authority,\nrather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would\ndetermine the powers of the receiver and the\nrights and obligations of creditors and other\nparties who have transacted with Group Inc.\nThere are substantial\ndifferences between the rights available to\ncreditors in the orderly liquidation\nauthority and in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,\nincluding the right of the FDIC under the\norderly liquidation authority to disregard\nthe strict priority of creditor claims\nin some circumstances (which would otherwise\nbe respected by a bankruptcy court) and the\nuse of an administrative claims procedure to\ndetermine creditors\u0092 claims (as opposed to\nthe judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy\nproceedings). In\ncertain circumstances under the orderly\nliquidation authority, the FDIC could elevate\nthe priority of claims that it determines\nnecessary to facilitate a smooth and orderly\nliquidation without the need to obtain\ncreditors\u0092 consent or prior\ncourt review. In addition, the FDIC has the\nright to transfer claims to a third party or\n\u0093bridge\u0094 entity under the orderly liquidation\nauthority.\n\nThe FDIC has announced that a single point of\nentry strategy may be a desirable strategy to\nresolve a large financial institution such as\nGroup Inc. in\na manner that would, among other things,\nimpose losses on shareholders, debt holders\n(including, in our case, holders of our\nsecurities, which are guaranteed by Group\nInc.) and other creditors of the top-tier\nholding company (in our case, Group Inc.),\nwhile permitting the holding company\u0092s\nsubsidiaries to continue to operate. In\naddition, the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (Federal Reserve\nBoard) has adopted requirements that U.S.\nG-SIBs, including Group Inc., maintain\nminimum amounts of long-term debt and total\nloss- absorbing capacity to facilitate the\napplication of the single point of entry\nresolution strategy. It is possible that the\napplication of the single point of entry\nstrategy under the orderly liquidation\n\n8\n\nauthority \u0097 in which Group Inc. would be the\nonly entity to enter resolution proceedings \u0097\nwould result in greater losses to holders of\nour securities, which are guaranteed by\nGroup Inc. (including holders of our fixed\nrate, floating rate and indexed debt\nsecurities), than the losses that would\nresult from the application of a bankruptcy\nproceeding or a different resolution\nstrategy, such as a multiple point of entry\nresolution strategy for Group Inc. and\ncertain of its material subsidiaries.\nAssuming Group Inc. entered resolution\nproceedings and that support from Group Inc.\nor other available resources to its\nsubsidiaries (other than us) was sufficient\nto\nenable those subsidiaries to remain solvent,\nlosses at the subsidiary level (other than\nus) would be transferred to Group Inc. and\nultimately borne by Group Inc.\u0092s security\nholders, third-party creditors of Group\nInc.\u0092s subsidiaries (other\nthan us) would receive full recoveries on\ntheir claims, and Group Inc.\u0092s creditors\n(including holders of our debt securities,\nwhich are guaranteed by Group Inc.) could\nface significant and possibly complete\nlosses. In that case, Group\nInc.\u0092s creditors would face losses while the\nthird-party creditors of Group Inc.\u0092s\nsubsidiaries (other than us) would incur no\nlosses because the subsidiaries would\ncontinue to operate and would not enter\nresolution or bankruptcy\nproceedings. In addition, holders of Group\nInc.\u0092s eligible LTD (defined below) and its\nother creditors (including holders of our\ndebt securities, which are guaranteed by\nGroup Inc.) could face losses ahead of other\nsimilarly situated creditors\nin a resolution under the orderly liquidation\nauthority if the FDIC exercised its right,\ndescribed above, to disregard the priority of\ncreditor claims.\n\nThe orderly liquidation authority also\nprovides the FDIC with authority to cause\ncreditors and shareholders of a financial\ncompany (such as Group Inc.)\nin receivership to bear losses before\ntaxpayers are exposed to such losses, and\namounts owed to the U.S. government would\ngenerally receive a statutory payment\npriority over the claims of private\ncreditors, including senior creditors. In\naddition,\nunder the orderly liquidation authority,\nclaims of creditors (including holders of our\nsecurities) could be satisfied through the\nissuance of equity or other securities in a\nbridge entity to which Group Inc.\u0092s assets\nare transferred. If such a securities-for-\nclaims exchange were implemented, there can\nbe no assurance that the value of the\nsecurities of the bridge entity would be\nsufficient to repay or satisfy all or\nany part of the creditor claims for which the\nsecurities were exchanged. While the FDIC has\nissued regulations to implement the orderly\nliquidation authority, not all aspects of how\nthe FDIC might exercise this authority are\nknown and additional\nrulemaking is possible. In addition, certain\njurisdictions, including the U.K. and the\nE.U., have implemented, or are considering,\nchanges to resolution regimes to provide\nresolution authorities with the ability to\nrecapitalize a failing entity by\nwriting down its unsecured debt or converting\nits unsecured debt into equity. Such \u0093bail-\nin\u0094 powers are intended to enable the\nrecapitalization of a failing institution by\nallocating losses to its\nshareholders and unsecured debtholders. For\nexample, the Bank of England requires a\ncertain amount of intercompany funding that\nwe provide to our material U.K. subsidiaries\nto contain a contractual trigger to expressly\npermit the Bank of England to\nexercise such \u0093bail-in\u0094 powers in certain\ncircumstances. If the intercompany funding\nGroup Inc. provides to our subsidiaries is\n\u0093bailed in,\u0094 Group Inc.\u0092s claims on its\nsubsidiaries\nwould be subordinated to the claims of the\nsubsidiaries\u0092 third-party creditors or\nwritten down. U.S. regulators are considering\nand non-U.S. authorities have adopted\nrequirements that certain subsidiaries\nof large financial institutions maintain\nminimum amounts of total loss-absorbing\ncapacity that would pass losses up from the\nsubsidiaries to the top-tier BHC and,\nultimately, to security holders of the top-\ntier holding company in the event of failure.\n\nThe application of Group Inc.\u0092s proposed\nresolution strategy could result in greater\nlosses for Group Inc.\u0092s security holders.\n\nAs required by the Dodd-Frank Act and\nregulations issued by the Federal\nReserve Board and the FDIC, Group Inc. is\nrequired to provide to the Federal Reserve\nBoard and the FDIC a plan for its rapid and\norderly resolution in the event of material\nfinancial distress affecting the firm or the\nfailure of Group Inc. In its\nresolution plan, Group Inc. would be resolved\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The strategy\ndescribed in Group Inc.\u0092s resolution plan is\na variant of the single point of entry\nstrategy: Group Inc. and Goldman Sachs\nFunding LLC (\u0093Funding\nIHC\u0094), a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of\nGroup Inc.,\n\n9\n\nwould recapitalize and provide liquidity to\ncertain major subsidiaries (which does not\ninclude us), including through the\nforgiveness of intercompany indebtedness, the\nextension of the maturities\nof intercompany indebtedness and the\nextension of additional intercompany loans.\nIf this strategy were successful, creditors\nof some or all of Group Inc.\u0092s major\nsubsidiaries (which does not include us)\nwould receive full recoveries on their\nclaims, while Group Inc.\u0092s security holders\ncould face significant and possibly complete\nlosses.\n\nTo facilitate the execution of its resolution\nplan, Group Inc. formed Funding IHC. In\nexchange for an unsecured subordinated\nfunding note and equity interest, Group Inc.\ntransferred certain intercompany receivables\nand substantially all of its global core\nliquid assets (\u0093GCLA\u0094) to\nFunding IHC, and agreed to transfer\nadditional GCLA above prescribed thresholds.\n\nGroup Inc. also put in place a Capital and\nLiquidity Support\nAgreement (\u0093CLSA\u0094) among Group Inc., Funding\nIHC and its major subsidiaries (which does\nnot include us). Under the CLSA, Funding IHC\nhas provided Group Inc. with a committed line\nof credit that allows Group Inc. to draw\nsufficient funds to\nmeet its cash needs during the ordinary\ncourse of business. In addition, if Group\nInc.\u0092s financial resources deteriorate so\nseverely that resolution may be imminent, (i)\nthe committed line of credit will\nautomatically terminate and the\nunsecured subordinated funding note will\nautomatically be forgiven, (ii) all\nintercompany receivables owed by the major\nsubsidiaries (which does not include us) to\nGroup Inc. will be transferred to Funding IHC\nor their maturities will be\nextended to five years, (iii) Group Inc. will\nbe obligated to transfer substantially all of\nits remaining intercompany receivables and\nGCLA (other than an amount to fund\nanticipated bankruptcy expenses) to Funding\nIHC, and (iv) Funding IHC\nwill be obligated to provide capital and\nliquidity support to the major subsidiaries\n(which does not include us). Group Inc.\u0092s and\nFunding IHC\u0092s obligations under the CLSA are\nsecured pursuant to a related security\nagreement. Such actions\nwould materially and adversely affect Group\nInc.\u0092s liquidity. As a result, during a\nperiod of severe stress, Group Inc. might\ncommence bankruptcy proceedings at an earlier\ntime than it otherwise would if the CLSA and\nrelated security agreement\nhad not been implemented.\n\nIf Group Inc.\u0092s proposed resolution strategy\nwere successful, holders of our debt\nsecurities, which are guaranteed\nby Group Inc., could face significant losses.\nIn that case, holders of our debt securities\ncould face losses while the third-party\ncreditors of Group Inc.\u0092s major subsidiaries\n(which does not include us) would incur no\nlosses because those\nsubsidiaries would continue to operate and\nnot enter resolution or bankruptcy\nproceedings. As part of the strategy, Group\nInc. could also seek to elevate the priority\nof its guarantee obligations relating to its\nmajor subsidiaries\u0092 (which does\nnot include us) derivatives contracts or\ntransfer them to another entity so that\ncross-default and early termination rights\nwould be stayed under the International Swaps\nand Derivatives Association Universal\nResolution Stay Protocol or International\nSwaps and Derivatives Association 2018 U.S.\nResolution Stay Protocol, as applicable,\nwhich would result in Group Inc.\u0092s other\ncreditors (including holders of our debt\nsecurities, which are guaranteed by Group\nInc.) incurring losses ahead of the\nbeneficiaries of those guarantee obligations.\nIt is also possible that Group Inc.\u0092s other\ncreditors (including holders of our debt\nsecurities, which are guaranteed by Group\nInc.) could incur losses ahead of other\nsimilarly situated creditors of\nGroup Inc.\u0092s major subsidiaries. If Group\nInc.\u0092s preferred resolution strategy were not\nsuccessful, Group Inc.\u0092s financial condition\nwould be adversely impacted and holders of\nour debt securities, which are guaranteed by\nGroup Inc.,\nmay as a consequence be in a worse position\nthan if the strategy had not been\nimplemented. In all cases, any payments to\nholders of our debt securities are dependent\non our ability to make such payments out of\nfunds provided by Group Inc. and Group\nInc.\u0092s ability to make payments on its\nguarantee and are therefore subject to Group\nInc.\u0092s credit risk.\n\n10\n\nSenior debt securities issued on or after\nJuly 1, 2020 (other than new issuances of\nSeries E Medium-Term Notes or reopenings of\npreviously issued Series E Medium-Term Notes)\nunder the 2008 GSFC indenture will provide\nonly limited acceleration and enforcement\nrights.\n\nWe have modified the 2008 GSFC indenture\nunder which our senior debt securities may be\nissued to provide that, for any such debt\nsecurities issued on or\nafter July 1, 2020 (other than new issuances\nof Series E Medium-Term Notes or reopenings\nof previously issued Series E Medium-Term\nNotes), the only events of default will be\npayment defaults that continue for a\n30-day grace period and insolvency events as\nspecified herein, unless the applicable\nprospectus supplement says otherwise. Any\nother default under or breach of the\nindenture or any such securities will not\ngive rise to an event of default, whether\nafter notice, the passage of time or\notherwise. As a consequence, if any such\nother default or breach occurs, neither the\ntrustee nor the holders of any such\nsecurities issued on or after July 1, 2020\nwill be entitled to accelerate the maturity\nof any securities \u0097 that is, they will not be\nentitled to declare the principal of any\nsecurities to be immediately due and payable\nbecause of such other default or breach\n(other than any securities\nwhose terms specify otherwise, as described\nin the applicable prospectus supplement).\nThese other defaults and breaches would\ninclude, among others, any breach of the\ncovenants described below under \u0093\u0097 Mergers\nand Similar\nTransactions\u0094. In addition, if any such other\ndefault or breach occurs, neither the trustee\nnor the holders of any such securities will\nbe entitled to enforce or seek any remedy\nunder the 2008 GSFC indenture or the\nsecurities, except as\ndescribed below under \u0093\u0097 Default, Remedies\nand Waiver of Default\u0094 in respect of certain\ncovenant breaches.\n\nThe limitations on events\nof default, acceleration rights and other\nremedies described in the prior paragraph do\nnot apply with regard to any securities\nissued under the 2007 GSFC indenture or to\nany securities issued prior to July 1, 2020\nunder the 2008 GSFC indenture\nor to new issuances or reopenings of\npreviously issued Series E Medium-Term Notes.\nTherefore, if certain defaults or breaches\noccur, holders of securities issued before\nJuly 1, 2020 or holders of new or reopened\nSeries E Medium-Term Notes\nmay be able to accelerate their securities so\nthat such securities become immediately due\nand payable while you, as a holder of\nsecurities issued on or after July 1, 2020\nthat are not Series E Medium-Term Notes, may\nnot be able to do so. In\nsuch an event, our obligation to repay the\naccelerated securities in full could\nadversely affect our ability to make timely\npayments on your securities thereafter. These\nlimitations on your rights and remedies could\nadversely affect the market value\nof your securities, especially during times\nof financial stress for us or our industry.\n\nPlease see \u0093Description of Debt Securities We\nMay\nOffer \u0097 Default, Remedies and Waiver of\nDefault\u0094 below for an explanation of the\nterms \u00932007 GSFC indenture\u0094, \u00932008 GSFC\nindenture\u0094, \u0093event of default\u0094 and \u0093covenant\nbreach\u0094, as well as for\ninformation regarding acceleration rights and\nremedies.\n\nHolders of our senior debt securities issued\non or after July 1, 2020 under the 2008 GSFC\nindenture (other than new issuances of Series\nE Medium-Term Notes or reopenings of\npreviously issued Series E Medium-Term Notes)\nand holders of our subordinated debt\nsecurities under the subordinated debt\nindenture could be at greater risk for being\nstructurally subordinated if we sell or\ntransfer our assets substantially as an\nentirety to one or more of the subsidiaries\nof Group Inc. or Group Inc. sells or\ntransfers its assets substantially as an\nentirety to one or more of its subsidiaries.\n\nWith respect to any securities issued on or\nafter July 1, 2020 under the 2008 GSFC\nindenture (other than new issuances of Series\nE\nMedium-Term Notes or reopenings of previously\nissued Series E Medium-Term Notes) and any\nsecurities issued under the subordinated debt\nindenture, we may sell or transfer our assets\nsubstantially as an entirety, in one or more\ntransactions, to one or\nmore entities, provided that our assets and\nthe assets of our direct or indirect\nsubsidiaries in which we own a majority of\nthe combined voting power, taken together,\nare not sold or transferred substantially as\nan entirety to\n\n11\n\none or more entities that are not majority-\nowned subsidiaries of Group Inc., and Group\nInc. may sell or transfer its assets,\nsubstantially as an entirety, in one or more\ntransactions, to one or\nmore entities, provided that the assets of\nGroup Inc. and its direct or indirect\nsubsidiaries in which it owns a majority of\nthe combined voting power, taken together,\nare not sold or transferred substantially as\nan entirety to one or more entities\nthat are not such subsidiaries.

Also, in this\nsection, references to \u0093holders\u0094 mean those\nwho own debt securities registered in their\nown names, on the books that we or the\ntrustee maintain for this purpose, and not\nthose who own beneficial interests in debt\nsecurities registered in street name or in\ndebt securities issued in book-entry form\nthrough one or more depositaries. Owners of\nbeneficial interests in the debt securities\nshould read the section below entitled \u0093Legal\nOwnership and Book-Entry Issuance\u0094.\n\nDebt Securities May Be Senior or Subordinated\n\nWe may issue from time to time senior or\nsubordinated debt securities. Neither the\nsenior debt securities nor the subordinated\ndebt securities will be\nsecured by any of our property or assets or\nproperty or assets of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. or its subsidiaries. Thus, by\nowning a debt security, you are one of our\nunsecured creditors.\n\nThe senior debt securities will constitute\npart of our senior debt, will be issued under\neither of the senior debt indentures (as\ndescribed in\n\u0093Description of Debt Securities We May Offer\n\u0097 The Senior Debt Indentures and the\nSubordinated Debt Indenture\u0094), and will rank\nequally with all of our other unsecured and\nunsubordinated debt.\n\nThe subordinated debt securities will\nconstitute part of our subordinated debt,\nwill be issued under the subordinated debt\nindenture described below and\nwill be subordinate in right of payment to\nall of our \u0093senior indebtedness\u0094, as defined\nin the subordinated debt indenture. The\nprospectus supplement for any series of\nsubordinated debt securities or the\ninformation incorporated in this\nprospectus by reference will indicate the\napproximate amount of senior indebtedness\noutstanding as of the end of our most recent\nfiscal quarter.\n\nThe two senior debt indentures do not, and\nthe subordinated debt indenture will not,\nlimit our ability to incur additional senior\nindebtedness.\n\nWhen we refer to \u0093debt securities\u0094 in this\nprospectus, we mean both the senior debt\nsecurities and the subordinated debt\nsecurities, unless\nthe context requires otherwise.\n\nThe Senior Debt Indentures and the\nSubordinated Debt Indenture\n\nThe senior debt securities and the\nsubordinated debt securities are each\ngoverned by a document called an \u0093indenture\u0094.\nThe applicable\nprospectus supplement will tell you whether\nthe senior debt securities to be offered and\nsold will be governed by (i) the Senior Debt\nIndenture, dated as of December 4, 2007, as\namended or supplemented from time to time,\namong us, The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., as guarantor, and\nThe Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known\nas The Bank of New York), as trustee, which\nwe refer to as the \u00932007 GSFC indenture\u0094, or\n(ii) the Senior Debt Indenture, dated as of\nOctober 10, 2008, as amended or supplemented\nfrom time to time, among us, The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc., as guarantor, and The Bank\nof New York Mellon, as trustee, which we\nrefer to as the \u00932008 GSFC indenture\u0094. We\nrefer to the 2007\nGSFC indenture and the 2008 GSFC indenture\ntogether as the \u0093senior debt indentures\u0094. At\na later date, we may enter into a\nsupplemental indenture with The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc., as guarantor, and a bank, trust\ncompany or other financial\ninstitution (which may include The Bank of\nNew York Mellon), as trustee, which will\nmodify the\n\n14\n\n2008 GSFC indenture to provide for the\nissuance of subordinated debt securities of\nGSFC. Subordinated debt securities will be\ngoverned by the 2008 GSFC indenture, as\nsupplemented by the supplemental indenture,\nwhich we refer to together as the\n\u0093subordinated debt indenture\u0094. We refer to\nthe senior debt indentures and the\nsubordinated debt indenture together as the\n\u0093debt indentures\u0094. We will file the\nsubordinated debt indenture, when executed,\nwith the SEC as an exhibit to an amendment to\nthe registration statement of which this\nprospectus is a part. See \u0093Available\nInformation\u0094 above for information on how to\nobtain a copy of the subordinated debt\nindenture when it is filed. The debt\nindentures will be substantially identical,\nexcept for the covenant of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. described below under \u0093\u0097\nRestriction on Liens\u0094, which will be included\nonly in the senior debt indentures, the\nprovisions relating to subordination, which\nwill be included only in the subordinated\ndebt indenture, the provisions relating to\n\u0093tranches\u0094 of securities, which are included\nonly in the 2007 GSFC indenture, certain\nprovisions described below under \u0093Default,\nRemedies and Waiver of Default \u0097 Events of\nDefault\u0094, which vary substantially between\nthe two senior debt indentures and certain\nprovisions described below under\n\u0093Modification of the Debt Indentures and\nWaiver of Covenants\u0094, which vary\nsubstantially between the two senior debt\nindentures. Whether securities (other than\nSeries E Medium-Term Notes) have been issued\nbefore or after July 1, 2020 under the 2008\nGSFC indenture will be determined by us by\nreference to the time of the original\nissuance of the series of which such\nsecurities are a part. For this purpose,\n\u0093series\u0094 means securities with the same CUSIP\nnumber. Unless otherwise provided in your\nprospectus supplement, all securities issued\nunder the 2008 GSFC indenture on or after\nJuly 1, 2020 (other than Series E Medium-Term\nNotes) will be subject to the provisions of\nthe Seventh Supplemental Indenture, dated as\nof July 1, 2020, to the 2008 GSFC indenture.\nThe trustee under each senior debt indenture\nhas, and under the subordinated debt\nindenture will have, two main roles:\n                                              \n      First, the trustee can enforce your     \n      rights against us or The Goldman Sachs  \n      Group, Inc. if we or The Goldman Sachs  \n      Group,                                  \n      Inc. defaults. There are some           \n      limitations on the extent to which the  \n      trustee acts on your behalf, which we   \n      describe below under \u0093\u0097 Default,          \n      Remedies and Waiver of Default\u0094.         \n                                              \n                                              \n      Second, the trustee performs            \n      administrative duties for us, such as   \n      sending you interest payments and       \n      notices.                                \n                                              \nSee \u0093\u0097 Our Relationship With the Trustee\u0094\nbelow for more information about the trustee.\nWhen we refer to the \u0093indenture\u0094 or the\n\u0093trustee\u0094 with respect to any debt securities,\nwe mean the debt indenture under which those\ndebt securities are issued and the trustee\nunder that debt indenture. We May Issue Many\nDebt Securities or Series of Debt Securities\nWe may issue many distinct debt securities or\nseries of debt securities under any of our\nthree debt indentures. This section summarizes\nterms of the debt securities that apply\ngenerally to all debt securities and series of\ndebt securities. The provisions of each debt\nindenture allow us not only to issue debt\nsecurities with terms different from those of\ndebt securities previously issued under that\ndebt indenture, but also to \u0093reopen\u0094\npreviously issued debt securities and issue\nadditional debt securities as the same series,\nwith the same CUSIP number, stated maturity,\ninterest payment dates, if any, and other\nterms, except for the date of issuance and\nissue price. We will describe the specific\nterms of your debt securities in the\napplicable prospectus supplement accompanying\nthis prospectus. Those terms may vary from the\nterms described here. Under the 2007 GSFC\nindenture, we refer to each distinct debt\nsecurity as a \u0093tranche\u0094, each tranche\ncomprising a portion (or, if there is only one\ntranche, all) of the series to which such\ntranche 15\n\nbelongs. A \u0093tranche\u0094 under the 2007 GSFC\nindenture means all securities that have the\nsame CUSIP number, stated maturity, interest\npayment dates, if any, and other terms, except\nfor the\ndate of issuance and issue price, or as may\notherwise be specified in your prospectus\nsupplement. We will determine whether a series\nof senior debt securities issued under the\n2007 GSFC indenture is to be issued in\nmultiple tranches at the time the\nseries is created and, if it is, we will\ndetermine which securities will be in each\ntranche at the time the tranche is issued.\nTherefore, when we refer to \u0093debt securities\u0094\nin this prospectus, we mean the applicable\ntranche or tranches of\nsenior debt securities if such debt securities\nare issued under the 2007 GSFC indenture or\nthe particular debt securities or series of\ndebt securities if such debt securities are\nissued under the 2008 GSFC indenture or the\nsubordinated debt\nindenture, unless the context requires\notherwise.\n\nAs you read this section, please remember that\nthe specific terms of your debt security as\ndescribed in your prospectus supplement will\nsupplement and, if applicable, may modify or\nreplace the general terms described in this\nsection. If there are any differences between\nyour prospectus supplement and this\nprospectus, your prospectus supplement will\ncontrol. Thus, the statements we make in this\nsection may not apply to your debt security.\n\nWhen we refer to \u0093debt securities\u0094\nor a \u0093series of debt securities\u0094, we mean,\nrespectively, debt securities or a series of\ndebt securities issued under the applicable\ndebt indenture. When we refer to your\nprospectus supplement, we mean the prospectus\nsupplement describing\nthe specific terms of the debt security you\npurchase. The terms used in your prospectus\nsupplement will have the meanings described in\nthis prospectus, unless otherwise specified.\n\nAmounts That We May Issue\n\nNone of the debt\nindentures limits the aggregate amount of debt\nsecurities that we may issue or the number of\nseries or the aggregate amount of any\nparticular series of debt securities. We may\nissue debt securities and other securities at\nany time without your\nconsent and without notifying you.\n\nThe debt indentures and the debt securities do\nnot limit our ability to incur other\nindebtedness or to issue\nother securities. Also, we are not subject to\nfinancial or similar restrictions by the terms\nof the debt securities, except for The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. as described below under \u0093\u0097\nRestriction on Liens\u0094.\n\nPrincipal Amount, Stated Maturity and Maturity\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the principal amount\nof a debt security means the principal amount\npayable at its stated maturity, unless such\namount is not\ndeterminable, in which case the principal\namount of a debt security is its face amount.\nAny debt securities owned by us, The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. or any of our other\naffiliates are not deemed to be outstanding.\n\nThe term \u0093stated maturity\u0094 with respect to any\ndebt security means the day on which the\nprincipal amount of your debt security is\nscheduled to\nbecome due. The principal of your debt\nsecurity may become due sooner, by reason of\nredemption or acceleration after a default or\notherwise in accordance with the terms of your\ndebt security. The day on which the principal\nof your debt security\nactually becomes due, whether at the stated\nmaturity or otherwise, is called the\n\u0093maturity\u0094 of the principal. You will receive\nthe principal amount of your debt security at\nmaturity (plus accrued and unpaid interest, if\nany), unless your\nprospectus supplement specifies another\namount.\n\nWe also use the terms \u0093stated maturity\u0094 and\n\u0093maturity\u0094 to refer to the days\nwhen other payments become due. For example,\nwe may refer to a regular interest payment\ndate when an installment of\n\n16\n\ninterest is scheduled to become due as the\n\u0093stated maturity\u0094 of that installment. When we\nrefer to the \u0093stated maturity\u0094 or the\n\u0093maturity\u0094 of a debt security without\nspecifying a particular payment, we mean the\nstated maturity or maturity, as the case may\nbe, of the principal.\n\nThis Section Is Only a Summary\n\nThe debt indentures and their associated\ndocuments, including your debt security,\ncontain the full legal text of the matters\ndescribed in this\nsection and your prospectus supplement. We\nhave filed copies of the senior debt\nindentures and will file a copy of the\nsubordinated debt indenture, when executed,\nwith the SEC as exhibits to our registration\nstatement, of which this prospectus is a\npart. See \u0093Available Information\u0094 above for\ninformation on how to obtain copies of such\ndebt indentures.\n\nThis section and your prospectus\nsupplement summarize all the material terms of\nthe debt indentures, where applicable, and\nyour debt security. They do not, however,\ndescribe every aspect of the debt indentures\nand your debt security. For example, in this\nsection and your prospectus\nsupplement, we use terms that have been given\nspecial meaning in the debt indentures, but we\ndescribe the meaning for only the more\nimportant of those terms. Your prospectus\nsupplement will have a more detailed\ndescription of the specific terms of\nyour debt security.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe\nsenior debt indentures are, and the\nsubordinated debt indenture and the debt\nsecurities will be, governed by New York law.\n\nCurrency of Debt Securities\n\nAmounts that become due and payable on your\ndebt security in cash will be payable in a\ncurrency, composite currency, basket of\ncurrencies or currency unit or units specified\nin your prospectus supplement. We refer to\nthis currency, composite currency, basket of\ncurrencies or currency unit or units as a\n\u0093specified currency\u0094. The specified currency\nfor your debt\nsecurity will be U.S. dollars, unless your\nprospectus supplement states otherwise. Some\ndebt securities may have different specified\ncurrencies for principal and interest. You\nwill have to pay for your debt securities by\ndelivering the requisite\namount of the specified currency for the\nprincipal to GS&Co. or another firm that we\nname in your prospectus supplement, unless\nother arrangements have been made between you\nand us or you and GS&Co. We will make payments\non your debt\nsecurities in the specified currency, except\nas described below in \u0093\u0097 Payment Mechanics for\nDebt Securities\u0094. See \u0093Considerations Relating\nto Securities Denominated or Payable in or\nLinked to a\nNon-U.S. Dollar Currency\u0094 below for more\ninformation about risks of investing in debt\nsecurities of this kind.\n\nForm of Debt Securities\n\nWe will issue each\ndebt security in global \u0097i.e., book-entry \u0097\nform only, unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. Debt\nsecurities in book-entry form will be\nrepresented by a global security registered in\nthe name of a\ndepositary, which will be the holder of all\nthe debt securities represented by the global\nsecurity. Those who own beneficial interests\nin a global debt security will do so through\nparticipants in the depositary\u0092s securities\nclearing system, and\nthe rights of these indirect owners will be\ngoverned solely by the applicable procedures\nof the depositary and its participants. We\ndescribe book-entry securities below under\n\u0093Legal Ownership and Book-Entry Issuance\u0094.\n\nIn addition, we will issue each debt security\nin registered form, without coupons.\n\n17\n\nTypes of Debt Securities We may issue any of\nthe three types of senior debt securities or\nsubordinated debt securities described below.\nA debt security may have elements of each of\nthe three types of debt securities described\nbelow. For example, a debt security may bear\ninterest at a fixed rate for some periods and\nat a floating rate in others. Similarly, a\ndebt security may provide for a payment of\nprincipal at maturity linked to an index and\nalso bear interest at a fixed or floating\nrate. Fixed Rate Debt Securities A debt\nsecurity of this type will bear interest at a\nfixed rate described in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. This type includes zero\ncoupon debt securities, which bear no interest\nand are instead issued at a price lower than\nthe principal amount. See \u0093\u0097 Original Issue\nDiscount Debt Securities\u0094 below for more\ninformation about zero coupon and other\noriginal issue discount debt securities. Each\nfixed rate debt security, except any zero\ncoupon debt security, will bear interest from\nits original issue date or from the most\nrecent date to which interest on the debt\nsecurity has been paid or made available for\npayment. Interest will accrue on the principal\nof a fixed rate debt security at the fixed\nrate per annum stated in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, until the principal is\npaid or made available for payment or the debt\nsecurity is converted or exchanged. Interest\ndue on each interest payment date and at\nmaturity will be calculated as described below\nunder \u0093\u0097 Calculations of Interest on Debt\nSecurities\u0094. We will pay interest on each\ninterest payment date and at maturity as\ndescribed below under \u0093\u0097 Payment Mechanics for\nDebt Securities\u0094. If your debt security is a\nzero coupon debt security, the applicable\nprospectus supplement may specify the original\nissue discount and the information necessary\nto determine the accreted value. The accreted\nvalue will be (1) as of any date prior to the\nstated maturity, an amount equal to the sum of\n(A) the original issue price of your debt\nsecurity and (B) the portion of the excess of\nthe principal amount of your debt security\nover the original issue price that shall have\nbeen accreted from the original issue price on\na daily basis and compounded annually on a\ndate specified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, up to and including the stated\nmaturity, at a rate that will be specified in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement from the\noriginal issue date, computed on the basis of\nthe day count fraction set forth in your\nprospectus supplement; and (2) as of any date\non or after the stated maturity, the principal\namount of your debt security. Floating Rate\nDebt Securities A debt security of this type\nwill bear interest at rates that are\ndetermined by reference to an interest rate\nformula. In some cases, the rates may also be\nadjusted by adding or subtracting a spread or\nmultiplying by a spread multiplier and may be\nsubject to a minimum rate or a maximum rate.\nThe various interest rate formulas and these\nother features are described below in \u0093\u0097\nCalculations of Interest on Debt Securities \u0097\nFloating Rate Debt Securities\u0094. If your debt\nsecurity is a floating rate debt security, the\nformula and any adjustments that apply to the\ninterest rate will be specified in your\nprospectus supplement. Interest due on each\ninterest payment date and at maturity will be\ncalculated as described below under \u0093\u0097\nCalculations of Interest on Debt Securities\u0094.\nWe will pay interest on each interest payment\ndate and at maturity as described below under\n\u0093\u0097 Payment Mechanics for Debt Securities\u0094.\nIndexed Debt Securities A debt security of\nthis type provides that the principal amount\npayable at its maturity, and/or the amount of\ninterest payable on an interest payment date,\nwill be determined by reference to:\n                                          \n      securities of one or more issuers;  \n                                          \n18\n                               \n      one or more currencies;  \n                               \n                                \n      one or more commodities;  \n                                \n                            \n      one or more indices;  \n                            \n                                              \n      any other financial, economic or other  \n      measure or instrument, including the    \n      occurrence or                           \n      non-occurrence of any event or          \n      circumstance; and/or                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      one or more baskets of the items        \n      described above.                        \n                                              \nAny indexed securities that we issue will be\ncash settled only. An indexed debt security\nmay bear interest at a fixed or floating rate,\nif specified in your prospectus supplement.\nUnless otherwise indicated in your prospectus\nsupplement, indexed debt securities that bear\ninterest at a fixed rate will bear interest as\ndescribed above under \u0093\u0097 Fixed Rate Debt\nSecurities\u0094 and indexed debt securities that\nbear interest at a floating rate will bear\ninterest as described above under \u0093\u0097 Floating\nRate Debt Securities\u0094. If you purchase an\nindexed debt security, your prospectus\nsupplement will include information about the\nrelevant index or indices, about how amounts\nthat are to become payable will be determined\nby reference to the price or value of that\nindex or indices and about the terms on which\nthe security may be settled. Your prospectus\nsupplement will also identify the calculation\nagent that will calculate the amounts payable\nwith respect to the indexed debt security and\nwill have sole discretion in doing so. The\ncalculation agent may be GS&Co. or another of\nour affiliates. See \u0093Considerations Relating\nto Indexed Securities\u0094 for more information\nabout risks of investing in debt securities of\nthis type. Original Issue Discount Debt\nSecurities A fixed rate debt security, a\nfloating rate debt security or an indexed debt\nsecurity may be an original issue discount\ndebt security. A debt security of this type is\nissued at a price lower than its principal\namount and may provide that, upon redemption\nor acceleration of its maturity, an amount\nless than its principal amount may be payable.\nAn original issue discount debt security may\nbe a zero coupon debt security. A debt\nsecurity issued at a discount to its principal\nmay, for United States federal income tax\npurposes, be considered an original issue\ndiscount debt security, regardless of the\namount payable upon redemption or acceleration\nof maturity. See \u0093United States Taxation \u0097\nTaxation of Debt Securities \u0097 United States\nHolders \u0097 Original Issue Discount\u0094 below for a\nbrief description of the United States federal\nincome tax consequences of owning an original\nissue discount debt security. Information in\nYour Prospectus Supplement Your prospectus\nsupplement will describe the specific terms of\nyour debt security, which will include some or\nall of the following:\n                                              \n      whether it is a senior debt security    \n      or a subordinated debt security and,    \n      if it is a senior debt security, under  \n      which                                   \n      senior debt indenture it will be        \n      issued;

A market-making\ntransaction is one in which GS&Co. or another\nof our affiliates resells a security that it\nhas previously acquired from another holder. A\nmarket-making transaction in a particular\nsecurity occurs after the original issuance\nand sale of the security. See \u0093Plan of\nDistribution\u0094 below. Calculations of Interest\non Debt Securities Interest Rates and\nInterest. Fixed rate debt securities will have\nthe interest rate stated in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. 20\n\nFor each floating rate debt security, the\ncalculation agent will determine, on the\ncorresponding interest calculation or interest\ndetermination date, as described below or in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement, the\ninterest rate that takes effect on each\ninterest reset date. Upon the request of the\nholder of any floating rate debt security, the\ncalculation agent will provide for that debt\nsecurity the interest rate then in effect \u0097\nand, if determined, the interest rate that\nwill become effective on the next interest\nreset date. The calculation agent\u0092s\ndetermination of any interest rate, and its\ncalculation of the amount of interest for any\ninterest period, will be final and binding in\nthe absence of manifest error. In determining\nthe base rate that applies to a floating rate\ndebt security issued prior to July 1, 2020\nduring a particular interest period, the\ncalculation agent may obtain rate quotes from\nvarious banks or dealers active in the\nrelevant market, as described below or in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. Those\nreference banks and dealers may include the\ncalculation agent itself and its affiliates,\nas well as any underwriter, dealer or agent\nparticipating in the distribution of the\nrelevant floating rate debt securities and its\naffiliates, and they may include affiliates of\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. The references\nbelow to provisions of the 2006 ISDA\nDefinitions refer to the referenced provisions\nas published by the International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association, without regard to any\nsubsequent amendments or supplements (the\n\u00932006 ISDA Definitions\u0094). The calculation\nagent (in the case of floating rate debt\nsecurities) or the paying agent, which may be\nthe indenture trustee (in the case of fixed\nrate debt securities) will calculate the\namount of interest that has accrued during\neach interest period \u0097 i.e., the period from\nand including the original issue date, or the\nlast date to which interest has been paid\n(which may be an interest payment date,\ndepending on the business day convention that\napplies to your debt securities), to but\nexcluding the next date to which interest will\nbe paid (which may be an interest payment\ndate, depending on the business day convention\nthat applies to your debt securities, as\ndescribed under \u0093\u0097 Business Day Conventions\u0094\nbelow). For each interest period, the agent\nwill calculate the amount of accrued interest\nby multiplying the principal amount or face\namount of the debt security, as applicable, by\nan accrued interest factor for the interest\nperiod. The accrued interest factor will be\ndetermined by multiplying the per annum fixed\nrate or floating rate, as applicable, by a\nfactor resulting from the day count convention\nspecified below or in your prospectus\nsupplement, which may include the following:\n                                              \n      If \u00931/1 (ISDA)\u0094 or \u00931/1\u0094 is specified, the  \n      factor will be equal to 1, as           \n      described in                            \n      Section\u00a04.16(a) of the 2006 ISDA        \n      Definitions.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      If \u0093Actual/Actual\u0094, \u0093Actual/Actual         \n      (ISDA)\u0094, \u0093Act/Act\u0094 or \u0093Act/Act (ISDA)\u0094 is    \n      specified, the factor will be equal to  \n      the actual number of days in the        \n      interest period divided by 365 (or, if  \n      any portion of that interest period     \n      falls in a leap year, the sum of (1)\u00a0   \n      the actual number of days in that       \n      portion of the interest                 \n      period falling in a leap year divided   \n      by 366 and (2)\u00a0the actual number of     \n      days in that portion of the interest    \n      period falling in a non-leap year       \n      divided by 365), as described in        \n      Section\u00a04.16(b) of                      \n      the 2006 ISDA Definitions.              \n                                              \n                                              \n      If \u0093Actual/Actual (ICMA)\u0094 or \u0093Act/Act      \n      (ICMA)\u0094 is specified, the factor will    \n      be equal to the number of               \n      days in the interest period, including  \n      February\u00a029 in a leap year, divided by  \n      the product of (1)\u00a0the actual number    \n      of days in such interest period and     \n      (2)\u00a0the number of interest periods in   \n      the year, as described in               \n      Section\u00a04.16(c) of the 2006 ISDA        \n      Definitions.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      If \u0093Actual/365 (Fixed)\u0094, \u0093Act/365          \n      (Fixed)\u0094, \u0093A/365 (Fixed)\u0094 or \u0093A/365F\u0094 is     \n      specified, the factor will be equal to  \n      the actual number of days in the        \n      interest period divided by 365, as      \n      described in Section\u00a04.16(d) of the     \n      2006 ISDA Definitions.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      If \u0093Actual/360 (ISDA)\u0094, \u0093Act/360 (ISDA)\u0094,   \n      \u0093A/360 (ISDA)\u0094, \u0093Actual/360\u0094,               \n      \u0093Act/360\u0094 or \u0093A/360\u0094 is specified, the      \n      factor will be equal to the actual      \n      number of days in the interest period   \n      divided by 360, as described in         \n      Section\u00a04.16(e) of the 2006 ISDA        \n      Definitions.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      If \u009330/360 (ISDA)\u0094, \u0093360/360 (ISDA)\u0094, \u0093Bond  \n      Basis (ISDA)\u0094, \u009330/360\u0094,                   \n      \u0093360/360\u0094 or \u0093Bond Basis\u0094 is specified,     \n      the factor will be equal to the number  \n      of days in the interest period in       \n                                              \n21\n                                              \n  respect of which payment is being made      \n  divided by                                  \n  360, calculated on a formula basis as       \n  follows, as                                 \n  described in Section 4.16(f) of the 2006    \n  ISDA                                        \n  Definitions:                                \n                                              \n                                              \n[360 \u00d7 (Y 2\u0096 Y 1)] + [30 \u00d7 (M 2\u0096 M 1)] + (D 2\u0096\nD 1) 360 where: \u0093Y 1\u0094 is the year, expressed\nas a number, in which the first day of the\ninterest period falls;

All amounts used in or\nresulting from any\ncalculation relating to any debt security will\nbe rounded upward or downward, as appropriate,\nto the nearest cent, in the case of U.S.\ndollars, or to the nearest corresponding\nhundredth of a unit, in the case of a currency\nother than U.S. dollars,\nwith one-half cent or one-half of a\ncorresponding hundredth of a unit or more\nbeing rounded upward.\n\nInterest Reset Dates and Determining the New\nRate.The rate of interest on floating rate\ndebt securities will be reset daily, weekly,\nmonthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually,\ndepending on your rate and the terms of your\ndebt security. The date on which the interest\nrate resets and the new interest rate becomes\neffective is called the interest reset date.\nInterest reset dates\nare subject to adjustment, as described below\nunder \u0093\u0097 Business Day Conventions\u0094.\n\nThe interest rate that takes effect on a\nparticular interest reset date will be\ndetermined by the calculation agent for\ncertain base rates by reference to a\nparticular date called an interest\ndetermination date and, in any event, no later\nthan the business day prior to the interest\nreset\ndate. The calculation agent need not wait\nuntil the business day prior to the reset date\nto determine the interest rate if the rate\ninformation it needs to make the determination\nis available from the relevant sources sooner.\nThe base rate in effect\nfrom and including the original issue date to\nbut excluding the first interest reset date\n(\u0093the initial interest period\u0094) will be the\ninitial base rate, which will be specified in\nyour prospectus supplement. For floating rate\ndebt\nsecurities that reset daily or weekly, the\nbase rate in effect for each day following the\nfifth business day before an interest payment\ndate to, but excluding, the interest payment\ndate, and for each day following the fifth\nbusiness day before the\nmaturity to, but excluding, the maturity, will\nbe the base rate in effect on that fifth\nbusiness day.\n\nInterest Payment Dates.Subject\nto any applicable business day convention as\ndescribed under \u0093\u0097 Business Day Conventions\u0094\nbelow, interest on your debt securities will\nbe paid on the interest payment dates. The\ninterest payment dates will be specified in\nyour\nprospectus supplement. If debt securities are\noriginally issued after the regular record\ndate and before the date that would otherwise\nbe the first interest payment date, the first\ninterest payment date will be the date that\nwould otherwise be the\nsecond interest payment date. We have defined\nthe term \u0093regular record date\u0094 under \u0093\u0097\nPayment Mechanics for Debt Securities\u0094.\n\n23\n\nBusiness Day Conventions.If your prospectus\nsupplement specifies that one of the following\nbusiness day conventions is applicable to your\ndebt security, the interest payment dates,\ninterest reset dates and interest periods for\nyour debt securities will be affected (and,\nconsequently, may be adjusted) as described\nbelow, except that any payment due at maturity\n(including any interest payment) will not be\naffected as described below:\n                                              \n      \u0093Following business day convention\u0094       \n      means, for any relevant date other      \n      than the maturity, if such              \n      date would otherwise fall on a day      \n      that is not a business day, then such   \n      date will be postponed to the next day  \n      that is a business day.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      \u0093Modified following business day         \n      convention\u0094 means, for any relevant      \n      date other than the maturity,           \n      if such date would otherwise fall on a  \n      day that is not a business day, then    \n      such date will be postponed to the      \n      next day that is a business day,        \n      except that, if the next business day   \n      falls in the next calendar month, then  \n      such date will be advanced              \n      to the immediately preceding day that   \n      is a business day.                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      \u0093Following unadjusted business day       \n      convention\u0094 means, for any interest      \n      payment date, other than the            \n      maturity, that falls on a day that is   \n      not a business day, any payment due on  \n      such interest payment date will be      \n      postponed to the next day that is a     \n      business day; provided that interest    \n      due with respect to such interest       \n      payment date shall not accrue           \n      from and including such interest        \n      payment date to and including the date  \n      of payment of such interest as so       \n      postponed.

Base Rates .We currently expect\nto issue floating rate debt securities that\nbear interest at rates based on one or more of\nthe following base rates.\n                 \n      CMS rate;  \n                 \n                 \n      CMT rate;  \n                 \n                           \n      federal funds rate;  \n                           \n              \n      LIBOR;  \n              \n                    \n      SOFR; and/or  \n                    \n                      \n      treasury rate.  \n                      \nWe describe each of these base rates in\nfurther detail below in this section entitled\n\u0093\u0097 Calculations of Interest on Debt Securities\n\u0097 Floating Rate Debt Securities\u0094. If you\npurchase floating rate debt securities, your\nprospectus supplement will specify the type of\nbase rate that applies to your debt securities\nand whether your debt securities are subject\nto a spread, spread multiplier, minimum rate\nor maximum rate. Day Count Convention.Unless\notherwise specified in yourprospectus\nsupplement, federal funds rate debt\nsecurities, LIBOR debt securities, SOFR debt\nsecurities and prime rate debt securities will\nbe subject to the Actual/360 (ISDA) day count\nconvention, and CMS rate debt securities, CMT\nrate debt securities and treasury rate debt\nsecurities will be subject to the\nActual/Actual (ISDA) day count convention, as\ndescribed above under \u0093\u0097 Interest Rates and\nInterest\u0094. Initial Base Rate.Unless otherwise\nspecified in yourprospectus supplement, for\nfloating rate debt securities other than SOFR\ndebt securities, the initial base rate will be\nthe applicable base rate in effect from and\nincluding the original issue date to but\nexcluding the initial interest reset date. We\nwill specify the initial base rate in your\nprospectus supplement. Spread or Spread\nMultiplier .In some cases, the base rate for\nfloating rate debt securities may be adjusted:\n                                              \n      by adding or subtracting a specified    \n      number of basis points, called the      \n      spread, with one basis point being      \n      0.01%;                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      by multiplying the base rate by a       \n      specified percentage, called the        \n      spread multiplier; or                   \n                                              \n                                          \n      by a combination of the foregoing.  \n                                          \n25\n\nIf you purchase floating rate debt securities,\nyour prospectus supplement will specify\nwhether a spread or spread multiplier will\napply to your debt securities and, if so, the\namount of the applicable spread or spread\nmultiplier. Maximum and Minimum Rates.The\nactual interest rate, after being adjusted by\nthe spread or spread multiplier, may also be\nsubject to either or both of the following\nlimits:\n                                              \n      a maximum rate \u0097 i.e., a specified       \n      upper limit that the actual interest    \n      rate in effect at any time may not      \n      exceed;                                 \n      and/or                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      a minimum rate \u0097 i.e., a specified       \n      lower limit that the actual interest    \n      rate in effect at any time may not      \n      fall below.                             \n                                              \nIf you purchase floating rate debt securities,\nyour prospectus supplement will specify\nwhether a maximum rate and/or minimum rate\nwill apply to your debt securities and, if so,\nwhat those rates are. Whether or not a maximum\nrate applies, the interest rate on floating\nrate debt securities will in no event be\nhigher than the maximum rate permitted by New\nYork law, as it may be modified by U.S. law of\ngeneral application. Under current New York\nlaw, the maximum rate of interest, with some\nexceptions, for any loan in an amount less\nthan $250,000 is 16% and for any loan in the\namount of $250,000 or more but less than\n$2,500,000 is 25%, per year on a simple\ninterest basis. These limits do not apply to\nloans of $2,500,000 or more. Interest\nDetermination Dates .The interest rate that\ntakes effect on an interest reset date will be\ndetermined by the calculation agent for\ncertain base rates by reference to a\nparticular date called an interest\ndetermination date for floating rate debt\nsecurities other than SOFR debt securities.\nExcept as otherwise specified in your\nprospectus supplement:\n                                              \n      For CMS rate debt securities and CMT    \n      rate debt securities, the interest      \n      determination date relating to a        \n      particular                              \n      interest reset date will be the second  \n      U.S. Government securities business     \n      day preceding the interest reset date.  \n                                              \n                                              \n      For LIBOR debt securities, the          \n      interest determination date relating    \n      to a particular interest reset date     \n      will be the second                      \n      London business day preceding the       \n      interest reset date, unless the index   \n      currency is pounds sterling, in which   \n      case the interest determination date    \n      will be the interest reset date. We     \n      refer to an interest determination      \n      date for LIBOR debt securities as a     \n      LIBOR interest determination date.      \n                                              \n                                              \n      For EURIBOR debt securities, the        \n      interest determination date relating    \n      to a particular interest reset date     \n      will be the                             \n      second euro business day preceding the  \n      interest reset date. We refer to an     \n      interest determination date for         \n      EURIBOR debt securities as a EURIBOR    \n      interest determination date.            \n                                              \nSources and Corrections .If we refer to a rate\nas set forth on a display page, other\npublished source, information vendor or other\nvendor officially designated by the sponsor of\nthat rate, if there is a successor source for\nthe display page, other published source,\ninformation vendor or other official vendor,\nwe refer to that successor source as\napplicable as determined by the calculation\nagent. When we refer to a particular heading\nor headings on any of those sources, those\nreferences include any successor or\nreplacement heading or headings as determined\nby the calculation agent. If the applicable\nrate is based on information obtained from a\nRefinitiv page, that rate will be subject to\nthe corrections, if any, published on that\nRefinitiv page within one hour of the time\nthat rate was first displayed on such source.\nIf the applicable rate is based on information\nobtained from H.15 26\n\nDaily Update, that rate will be subject to the\ncorrections, if any, published by that source\nwithin 30 days of the day that rate was first\npublished in that source.\n\nCMS Rate.\n\nFloating Rate Debt\nSecurities Issued on or after July 1, 2020\n\nFor floating rate debt securities issued on or\nafter July 1, 2020 for which the base rate is\nCMS rate, unless otherwise specified in your\nprospectus supplement, the CMS rate will be\nthe offered rate appearing on the Refinitiv\npage ICESWAP1 for U.S. dollar swaps having a\nmaturity equal to the index maturity specified\nin your\nprospectus supplement as of approximately\n11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the\nrelevant interest determination date. If the\nCMS rate cannot be determined as described\nabove, the following procedures will apply in\ndetermining the CMS rate:\n\nIf the calculation agent determines on the\nrelevant interest determination date that the\nCMS rate has been discontinued, then the\ncalculation agent will\nuse a substitute or successor rate that it has\ndetermined in its sole discretion is most\ncomparable to the CMS rate, provided that if\nthe calculation agent determines there is an\nindustry-accepted successor rate, then the\ncalculation agent shall use\nsuch successor rate. If the calculation agent\nhas determined a substitute or successor rate\nin accordance with the foregoing, the\ncalculation agent in its sole discretion may\ndetermine the definition of business day and\nthe relevant interest\ndetermination date to be used, and any other\nrelevant methodology for calculating such\nsubstitute or successor rate, including any\nadjustment factor needed to make such\nsubstitute or successor rate comparable to the\nCMS rate, in a manner that is\nconsistent with any industry-accepted\npractices for such substitute or successor\nrate.\n\nUnless the calculation agent uses a substitute\nor successor\nrate as so provided, if the CMS rate cannot be\ndetermined in the manner described above on\nthe interest determination date, the CMS rate\nwill be determined by the calculation agent,\nafter consulting such sources as it deems\ncomparable to the\nforegoing display page, or any other source it\ndeems reasonable, in its sole discretion.\n\nFloating Rate Debt Securities Issued prior to\nJuly 1,\n2020\n\nFor floating rate debt securities issued prior\nto July 1, 2020 for which the base rate is CMS\nrate, unless otherwise specified in your\nprospectus supplement, the CMS rate for the\nrelevant interest reset date will be the rate\nappearing on the Refinitiv page ICESWAP1 for\nU.S. dollar swaps having a maturity equal to\nthe index maturity specified in your\nprospectus supplement as of\napproximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time,\non the relevant interest determination date.\nIf the CMS rate cannot be determined in this\nmanner, then:\n\nThe CMS rate for the relevant interest reset\ndate will be determined on the basis of the\nmid-market semi-annual\nswap rate quotations provided by five leading\nswap dealers in the New York City interbank\nmarket at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York\nCity time, on the relevant interest\ndetermination date. For this purpose, the\nsemi-annual swap rate means the mean\nof the bid and offered rates for the semi-\nannual fixed leg, calculated on a 30/360\n(ISDA) day count basis, of a fixed-for-\nfloating U.S. dollar interest rate swap\ntransaction with a term equal to the specified\nindex maturity, commencing on the relevant\ninterest reset date, with an acknowledged\ndealer of good credit in the swap market,\nwhere the floating leg, calculated on an\nActual/360 (ISDA) day count basis,\nis equivalent to LIBOR with a designated\nmaturity of three months, as such rate may be\ndetermined in accordance with the provisions\nset forth below under \u0093\u0097 LIBOR\u0094. The\ncalculation agent will select the five swap\ndealers in its sole\ndiscretion and will request the principal New\nYork City office of each of those dealers to\nprovide a quotation of its rate.\n\n27\n\nIf at least three quotations are provided, the\nCMS rate for that interest reset date will be\nthe arithmetic mean of the quotations\ndescribed above, eliminating the highest and\nlowest quotations or, in the event of\nequality, one of the highest and one of the\nlowest quotations. If fewer than three\nquotations are provided, the calculation agent\nwill determine the CMS rate in its sole\ndiscretion. CMT Rate . Floating Rate Debt\nSecurities Issued on or after July 1, 2020 For\nfloating rate debt securities issued on or\nafter July 1, 2020 for which the base rate is\nCMT rate, unless otherwise specified in your\nprospectus supplement, the manner in which the\nCMT rate is determined for the relevant\ninterest reset date will depend on the\ndesignated CMT Refinitiv pagethat is specified\nfor the debt in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. If no designated CMT Refinitiv\npage is specified, Refinitiv page FRBCMT will\nbe the designated CMT Refinitiv page for the\ndebt securities. If the designated CMT\nRefinitiv page for your floating rate debt\nsecurities is FRBCMT, the CMT rate for the\nrelevant interest reset date will be the yield\nfor Treasury securities at \u0093constant maturity\u0094\nfor a period of the designated CMT index\nmaturityas published by the Federal Reserve\nSystem Board of Governors, or its successor,\non its website or in another recognized\nelectronic source, in each case as determined\nby the calculation agent in its sole\ndiscretion, as such yield is displayed on the\ndesignated CMT Refinitiv page on the interest\ndetermination date. If the applicable rate\ndescribed above is not displayed on the\ndesignated CMT Refinitiv page, then the CMT\nrate will be the Treasury constant maturity\nrate for the designated CMT index maturity as\npublished by the Federal Reserve System Board\nof Governors, or its successor, on its website\nor in another recognized electronic source, in\neach case as determined by the calculation\nagent in its sole discretion. If the rate\ndescribed in the preceding paragraph does not\nappear on the website of the Federal Reserve\nSystem Board of Governors or in another\nrecognized electronic source, in each case as\ndetermined by the calculation agent in its\nsole discretion, then the CMT rate for the\nrelevant interest reset date will be the\nTreasury constant maturity rate for the\ndesignated CMT index maturity that:\n                                              \n      is published by the Board of Governors  \n      of the Federal Reserve System or the    \n      U.S. Department of the Treasury; and    \n                                              \n                                              \n      is determined by the calculation agent  \n      to be comparable to the applicable      \n      rate that would otherwise have been     \n      published on                            \n      the website of the Federal Reserve      \n      System Board of Governors or in         \n      another recognized electronic source,   \n      in each case as determined by the       \n      calculation agent in its sole           \n      discretion.                             \n                                              \nIf, on the relevant interest determination\ndate, the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System or the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury does not publish a yield on Treasury\nsecurities at \u0093constant maturity\u0094 for the\ndesignated CMT index maturity, after\nconsulting such sources as it deems comparable\nto any of the foregoing display pages, or any\nsuch source as it deems reasonable from which\nto estimate the CMT rate, the calculation\nagent shall determine the CMT rate in its sole\ndiscretion, provided that if the calculation\nagent determines there is an industry-accepted\nsuccessor CMT rate, then the calculation agent\nshall use such successor rate. If the\ncalculation agent has determined a substitute\nor successor rate in accordance with the\nforegoing, the calculation agent in its sole\ndiscretion may determine the business day\nconvention, the definition of business day and\nthe interest determination date to be used and\nany other relevant methodology for calculating\nsuch substitute or successor rate, including\nany adjustment factor needed to make such\nsubstitute or successor rate comparable to the\nCMT rate, in a manner that is consistent with\nany industry-accepted practices for such\nsubstitute or successor rate. 28\n\nIf the designated CMT Refinitiv page for the\nfloating rate debt securities issued on or\nafter\nJuly 1, 2020 is FEDCMT, the CMT rate for the\nrelevant interest reset date will be the\naverage of the yields for the five business\ndays for Treasury securities at \u0093constant\nmaturity\u0094 for a period of the designated CMT\nindex maturity as\nset forth on the website of the Federal\nReserve System Board of Governors or in\nanother recognized electronic source, in each\ncase as determined by the calculation agent in\nits sole discretion, as such yields are\ndisplayed on the designated CMT\nRefinitiv page on the relevant interest reset\ndate.\n\nIf the applicable average described above is\nnot displayed on the designated CMT Refinitiv\npage, then the CMT rate for the relevant\ninterest reset date will be the average of the\nyields for the five business days for Treasury\nsecurities at \u0093constant maturity\u0094 for a period\nof the relevant index maturity and for the\nfive business\ndays preceding the relevant interest reset\ndate as published on the website of the\nFederal Reserve System Board of Governors or\nin another recognized electronic source, in\neach case as determined by the calculation\nagent in its sole discretion.\n\nIf the applicable average described in the\npreceding paragraph does not appear on the\nwebsite of the Federal Reserve System Board of\nGovernors or in\nanother recognized electronic source, in each\ncase as determined by the calculation agent in\nits sole discretion, then the CMT rate for the\nrelevant interest reset date will be the\naverage of the five business days for Treasury\nsecurities at\n\u0093constant maturity\u0094 for a period equal to the\ndesignated CMT index maturity as otherwise\nannounced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork the five business days preceding the\nrelevant interest reset date.\n\nIf, on the relevant interest determination\ndate, the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System or the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury does not\npublish a yield on Treasury securities at\n\u0093constant maturity\u0094 for the designated CMT\nindex maturity, after consulting such sources\nas it deems comparable to any of the foregoing\ndisplay pages, or any such source as it deems\nreasonable from\nwhich to estimate the CMT rate, the\ncalculation agent shall determine the CMT rate\nin its sole discretion, provided that if the\ncalculation agent determines there is an\nindustry-accepted successor CMT rate, then the\ncalculation agent shall use such\nsuccessor rate. If the calculation agent has\ndetermined a substitute or successor rate in\naccordance with the foregoing, the calculation\nagent in its sole discretion may determine the\nbusiness day convention, the definition of\nbusiness day and the\ninterest determination date to be used and any\nother relevant methodology for calculating\nsuch substitute or successor rate, including\nany adjustment factor needed to make such\nsubstitute or successor rate comparable to the\nCMT rate, in a manner\nthat is consistent with any industry-accepted\npractices for such substitute or successor\nrate.\n\nFloating Rate Debt Securities Issued Prior to\nJuly 1, 2020\n\nFor floating rate debt securities issued prior\nto July 1, 2020 for which the base rate is CMT\nrate, unless otherwise\nspecified in your prospectus supplement, the\nmanner in which the CMT rate is determined for\nthe relevant interest reset date will depend\non the designated CMT Refinitiv pagethat is\nspecified for the floating rate debt\nsecurities in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement. If no\ndesignated CMT Refinitiv page is specified,\nRefinitiv page FRBCMT will be the designated\nCMT Refinitiv page for the floating rate debt\nsecurities.\n\nIf the designated CMT Refinitiv page for the\nfloating rate debt securities is FRBCMT, the\nCMT rate for the relevant interest reset date\nwill be the\nyield for Treasury securities at \u0093constant\nmaturity\u0094 for a period of the designated CMT\nindex maturityas published by the Federal\nReserve System Board of Governors, or its\nsuccessor, on its website or in another\nrecognized\nelectronic source, in each case as determined\nby the calculation agent in its sole\ndiscretion, as such yield is displayed on the\ndesignated CMT Refinitiv page on the interest\ndetermination date. If the applicable rate\ndescribed above is not\ndisplayed on the designated CMT Refinitiv\npage, then the CMT rate will be the Treasury\nconstant\n\n29\n\nmaturity rate for the designated CMT index\nmaturity as published by the Federal Reserve\nSystem Board of Governors, or its successor,\non its website or in another recognized\nelectronic source, in each case as determined\nby the calculation agent in its sole\ndiscretion. If the rate described in the\npreceding paragraph does not appear on the\nwebsite of the Federal Reserve System Board of\nGovernors or in another recognized electronic\nsource, in each case as determined by the\ncalculation agent in its sole discretion, then\nthe CMT rate for the relevant interest reset\ndate will be the Treasury constant maturity\nrate for the designated CMT index maturity\nthat:\n                                              \n      is published by the Board of Governors  \n      of the Federal Reserve System or the    \n      U.S. Department of the Treasury; and    \n                                              \n                                              \n      is determined by the calculation agent  \n      to be comparable to the applicable      \n      rate that would otherwise have been     \n      published on                            \n      the website of the Federal Reserve      \n      System Board of Governors or in         \n      another recognized electronic source,   \n      in each case as determined by the       \n      calculation agent in its sole           \n      discretion.                             \n                                              \nIf, on the relevant interest determination\ndate, the rate described in the preceding\nparagraph is not published by the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System or the\nU.S. Department of Treasury, then the CMT rate\nfor the relevant interest reset date will be\nthe yield to maturity of the arithmetic mean\nof the secondary market bid rates for the most\nrecently issued U.S. Treasury securities\nhaving an original maturity of approximately\nthe designated CMT index maturity and a\nremaining term to maturity of not less than\nthe designated CMT index maturity minusone\nyear, and in a representative amount, as of\napproximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time,\non the relevant interest determination date,\nquoted by three primary U.S. government\nsecurities dealers in New York City selected\nby the calculation agent. In selecting these\nbid rates, the calculation agent will request\nquotations from five primary dealers and will\ndisregard the highest quotation \u0097 or, if there\nis equality, one of the highest \u0097 and the\nlowest quotation \u0097 or, if there is equality,\none of the lowest. If fewer than five but more\nthan two such bid rates are provided, the CMT\nrate will be based on the arithmetic mean of\nthe bid prices provided, and neither the\nhighest nor lowest of such quotations will be\neliminated. If the calculation agent is unable\nto obtain three quotations of the kind\ndescribed in the preceding paragraph, the CMT\nrate for the relevant interest reset date will\nbe the yield to maturity of the arithmetic\nmean of the secondary market bid rates for\nU.S. Treasury securities with an original\nmaturity longer than the designated CMT index\nmaturity, with a remaining term to maturity\nclosest to the designated CMT index maturity\nand in a representative amount, as of\napproximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time,\non the relevant CMT interest determination\ndate, of three primary U.S. government\nsecurities dealers in New York City selected\nby the calculation agent. In selecting these\nbid rates, the calculation agent will request\nquotations from five of these primary dealers\nand will disregard the highest quotation \u0097 or,\nif there is equality, one of the highest \u0097 and\nthe lowest quotation \u0097 or, if there is\nequality, one of the lowest. If fewer than\nfive but more than two of these primary\ndealers are quoting, then the CMT rate for the\nrelevant interest reset date will be based on\nthe arithmetic mean of the bid rates so\nobtained, and neither the highest nor the\nlowest of those quotations will be\ndisregarded. If two U.S. Treasury securities\nwith an original maturity longer than the\ndesignated CMT index maturity have remaining\nterms to maturity that are equally close to\nthe designated CMT index maturity, the\ncalculation agent will obtain quotations for\nthe U.S. Treasury securities with the shorter\noriginal term to maturity. If two or fewer\nprimary dealers selected by the calculation\nagent are quoting as described in the\npreceding paragraph, the CMT rate for the\nrelevant interest reset date will be the rate\ndetermined by the calculation agent in its\nsole discretion, after consulting such sources\nas it deems comparable to any of the foregoing\nquotations or display page, or any such source\nas it deems reasonable from which to estimate\nthe rate for U.S. Treasury securities at\nconstant maturity or any of the foregoing bid\nrates. 30\n\nIf the designated CMT Refinitiv page for the\nfloating rate debt securities issued prior to\nJuly 1, 2020 is FEDCMT, the CMT rate for the\nrelevant interest reset date will be the one-\nweek average yield for Treasury securities at\n\u0093constant maturity\u0094 for a period of the\ndesignated CMT\nindex maturity as set forth on the website of\nthe Federal Reserve System Board of Governors\nor in another recognized electronic source, in\neach case as determined by the calculation\nagent in its sole discretion, as such yields\nare displayed on the\ndesignated CMT Refinitiv page on the relevant\ninterest reset date.\n\nIf the applicable average described above is\nnot displayed on the designated CMT\nRefinitiv page, then the CMT rate for the\nrelevant interest reset date will be the one-\nweek average yield for Treasury securities at\n\u0093constant maturity\u0094 for a period of the\ndesignated CMT index\nmaturity and for the week preceding the\nrelevant interest reset date as published on\nthe website of the Federal Reserve System\nBoard of Governors or in another recognized\nelectronic source, in each case as determined\nby the calculation agent in its\nsole discretion.\n\nIf the applicable average described in the\npreceding paragraph does not appear on the\nwebsite of the Federal Reserve System Board\nof Governors or in another recognized\nelectronic source, in each case as determined\nby the calculation agent in its sole\ndiscretion, then the CMT rate for the relevant\ninterest reset date will be the one-week\naverage yield for Treasury securities at\n\u0093constant maturity\u0094 for a period equal to the\ndesignated CMT index maturity as otherwise\nannounced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork for the week preceding the relevant\ninterest reset date.\n\nIf for the week preceding the relevant\ninterest reset date the Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York does not publish a\none-week average yield for Treasury securities\nat \u0093constant maturity\u0094 for a period equal to\nthe designated CMT index maturity for the\npreceding week, then the CMT rate for the\nrelevant interest reset\ndate will be the yield to maturity of the\narithmetic mean of the secondary market bid\nrates for the most recently issued U.S.\nTreasury securities having an original\nmaturity of approximately the designated CMT\nindex maturity and a remaining term to\nmaturity of not less than the designated CMT\nindex maturity minusone year, and in a\nrepresentative amount, as of approximately\n3:30 P.M., New York City time, on the relevant\nCMT interest determination date, quoted by\nthree primary U.S.\ngovernment securities dealers in New York City\nselected by the calculation agent. In\nselecting these bid rates, the calculation\nagent will request quotations from five\nprimary dealers and will disregard the highest\nquotation \u0097 or, if there is\nequality, one of the highest \u0097 and the lowest\nquotation \u0097 or, if there is equality, one of\nthe lowest. If fewer than five but more than\ntwo such bid rates are provided, the CMT rate\nwill be based on the arithmetic mean of the\nbid prices\nprovided, and neither the highest nor lowest\nof such quotations will be eliminated.\n\nIf the calculation agent is unable to obtain\nthree quotations\nof the kind described in the preceding\nparagraph, the CMT rate for the relevant\ninterest reset date will be the yield to\nmaturity of the arithmetic mean of the\nsecondary market bid rates for U.S. Treasury\nsecurities with an original maturity longer\nthan the designated CMT index maturity, with a\nremaining term to maturity closest to the\ndesignated CMT index maturity and in a\nrepresentative amount, as of approximately\n3:30 P.M., New York City time, on the relevant\nCMT interest determination\ndate, of three primary U.S. government\nsecurities dealers in New York City selected\nby the calculation agent.

If two U.S. Treasury securities\nwith an original maturity longer\nthan the designated CMT index maturity have\nremaining terms to maturity that are equally\nclose to the designated CMT index maturity,\nthe calculation agent will obtain quotations\nfor the U.S. Treasury securities with the\nshorter original term to\nmaturity.\n\n31\n\nIf two or fewer primary dealers selected by\nthe calculation agent are quoting as described\nin the\npreceding paragraph, the CMT rate for the\nrelevant interest reset date will be the rate\ndetermined by the calculation agent in its\nsole discretion, after consulting such sources\nas it deems comparable to any the foregoing\nquotations or display page,\nor any such source as it deems reasonable from\nwhich to estimate of the one-week average for\nU.S. Treasury securities at constant maturity\nor any of the foregoing bid rates.\n\nEURIBOR.For floating rate debt securities\nissued prior to July 1, 2020 for which the\nbase rate is EURIBOR, EURIBOR will be\nthe offered rate for deposits in euros having\nthe index maturity specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, as that rate appears on\nthe Refinitiv page EURIBOR01 as of\napproximately 11:00 A.M., Brussels time, on\nthe relevant interest\ndetermination date.\n\nIf the rate described above does not so appear\non the Refinitiv page EURIBOR01, EURIBOR will\nbe determined on the basis of the\nrates at which deposits in euros are offered\nby four major banks in the euro-zoneinterbank\nmarket, at approximately 11:00 A.M., Brussels\ntime, on the relevant EURIBOR interest\ndetermination date, to prime banks in the\neuro-zoneinterbank market for a period of the\nspecified index maturity commencing on the\nrelevant interest reset date and in a\nrepresentative amount, assuming an Actual/360\n(ISDA) day count basis. The calculation agent\nwill request the principal\neuro-zone office of each of these four banks\nto provide a quotation of its rate. If at\nleast two quotations are provided, EURIBOR for\nthe relevant interest reset date will be the\narithmetic mean of the quotations.\n\nIf fewer than two quotations are provided as\ndescribed in the preceding paragraph, EURIBOR\nfor the relevant interest reset date will be\nthe arithmetic\nmean of the rates quoted by major banks in the\neuro-zone, selected by the calculation agent\nat approximately 11:00 A.M., Brussels time, on\nthat interest reset date, for loans of euros\nto leading European banks for the specified\nindex maturity,\nbeginning on the relevant interest reset date,\nand in a representative amount.\n\nIf no quotation is provided as described in\nthe preceding paragraph,\nthen the calculation agent, after consulting\nsuch sources as it deems comparable to any of\nthe foregoing quotations or display page, or\nany such source as it deems reasonable from\nwhich to estimate EURIBOR or any of the\nforegoing lending rates,\nshall determine EURIBOR for that interest\nreset date in its sole discretion.\n\nFederal Funds Rate.For floating rate debt\nsecurities issued prior to July 1, 2020 for\nwhich the base rate is federal funds rate, the\napplicable prospectus supplement describes how\nfederal funds rate is determined.\n\nIn respect of future floating rate debt\nsecurities issued on or after July 1, 2020 for\nwhich the base rate is federal funds rate,\nfederal funds\nrate will be will be the rate for U.S. dollar\nfederal funds on the relevant interest reset\ndate, as set forth in H.15 Daily Update\nopposite the heading \u0093Federal funds\n(effective)\u0094, as that rate is displayed on the\nRefinitiv\npage FEDFUNDS1 for that day.\n\nIf, by approximately 5:00 P.M., New York City\ntime, on the day that is one New York City\nbanking day following the\nrelevant interest reset date, the federal\nfunds (effective) rate for the relevant\ninterest reset date does not appears on\nRefinitiv page FEDFUNDS1, then the federal\nfunds (effective) rate, for that interest\nreset date, will be the rate published in\nH.15 Daily Update, or another recognized\nelectronic source used for displaying that\nrate, under the heading \u0093Federal funds\n(effective)\u0094.\n\nIf the rate cannot be determined as described\nin the preceding paragraph, then the federal\nfunds (effective) rate for the relevant\ninterest reset date\nwill be the rate for the first day preceding\nthe relevant interest reset date for which\nsuch rate is set forth in H.15 Daily Update\nopposite the heading \u0093Federal funds\n(effective)\u0094, as such rate is displayed on the\nRefinitiv page\nFEDFUNDS1.\n\n32\n\nLIBOR .For floating rate debt securities\nissued prior to July 1, 2020 for which the\nbase rate is LIBOR, the applicable prospectus\nsupplement describes how LIBOR is determined.\nIn respect of future floating rate debt\nsecurities issued on or after July 1, 2020 for\nwhich the base rate is LIBOR, after the\ninitial interest period, LIBOR will be the\noffered rate appearing on the Refinitiv page\nLIBOR01as of approximately 11:00 A.M., London\ntime, on the relevant interest determination\ndate, for deposits in U.S. Dollars or other\nindex currency having the relevant index\nmaturity (e.g., three months) beginning on the\nrelevant interest reset date. If the rate\ndescribed above does not so appear on the\nRefinitiv page LIBOR01, then LIBOR for that\ninterest reset date will be equal to such rate\non the interest determination date when LIBOR\nfor the relevant index maturity was last\navailable on the Refinitiv page LIBOR01, as\ndetermined by the calculation agent.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to\nfloating rate securities issued on or after\nJuly 1, 2020 for which the base rate is LIBOR,\nif the calculation agent determines that a\nbenchmark transition event and its related\nbenchmark replacement date have occurred prior\nto the reference time in respect of any\ndetermination of the benchmark on any date,\nthe benchmark replacement will replace the\nthen-current benchmark for all purposes\nrelating to the floating rate debt securities\nin respect of such determination on such date\nand all determinations on all subsequent\ndates.

As used\nin this section entitled \u0093\u0097 Calculations of\nInterest on Debt Securities \u0097 Floating Rate\nDebt Securities \u0097 LIBOR\u0094: The term \u0093benchmark\n\u0094means, initially, LIBOR for the relevant\nindex maturity; provided that if a benchmark\ntransition event and its related benchmark\nreplacement date have occurred with respect to\nLIBOR for the relevant index maturity or the\nthen-current benchmark, then \u0093benchmark\u0094 means\nthe applicable benchmark replacement. The term\n\u0093benchmark replacement\u0094 means the interpolated\nbenchmark; provided that if the calculation\nagent cannot determine the interpolated\nbenchmark as of the benchmark replacement\ndate, 33\n\nthen \u0093benchmark replacement\u0094 means the first\nalternative set forth in the order below that\ncan be determined by the calculation agent as\nof the benchmark replacement date: (1) the sum\nof: (a) term SOFR and (b) the benchmark\nreplacement adjustment; (2) the sum of: (a)\ncompounded SOFR and (b) the benchmark\nreplacement adjustment; (3) the sum of: (a)\nthe alternate rate of interest that has been\nselected or recommended by the relevant\ngovernmental body as the replacement for the\nthen-current benchmark for the applicable\ncorresponding tenor and (b) the benchmark\nreplacement adjustment; (4) the sum of: (a)\nthe ISDA fallback rate and (b) the benchmark\nreplacement adjustment; (5) provided that if\n(i) the benchmark replacement cannot be\ndetermined in accordance with clause (3) or\n(4) above as of the benchmark replacement date\nor (ii) the calculation agent shall have\ndetermined that the ISDA fallback rate\ndetermined in accordance with clause (4) above\nis not an industry-accepted rate of interest\nas a replacement for the then-current\nbenchmark for U.S. dollar denominated floating\nrate debt securities at such time, then the\nbenchmark replacement shall be the sum of: (a)\nthe alternate rate of interest that has been\nselected by the calculation agent as the\nreplacement for the then current benchmark for\nthe applicable corresponding tenor giving due\nconsideration to any industry accepted rate of\ninterest as a replacement for the then-current\nbenchmark for U.S. dollar denominated floating\nrate fixed income instruments at such time and\n(b) the benchmark replacement adjustment. The\nterm \u0093benchmark replacement adjustment\u0094 means\nthe first alternative set forth in the order\nbelow that can be determined by the\ncalculation agent as of the benchmark\nreplacement date: (1) the spread adjustment\n(which may be a positive or negative value or\nzero), or method for calculating or\ndetermining such spread adjustment, that has\nbeen selected or recommended by the relevant\ngovernmental body for the applicable\nunadjusted benchmark replacement; (2) if the\napplicable unadjusted benchmark replacement is\nequivalent to the ISDA fallback rate, then the\nISDA fallback adjustment; (3) the spread\nadjustment (which may be a positive or\nnegative value or zero) that has been selected\nby the calculation agent giving due\nconsideration to any industry-accepted spread\nadjustment, or method for calculating or\ndetermining such spread adjustment, for the\nreplacement of the then-current benchmark with\nthe applicable unadjusted benchmark\nreplacement for U.S. dollar denominated\nfloating rate fixed income instruments at such\ntime.

If the\ncalculation agent has determined a substitute\nor successor rate in accordance with the\nforegoing, the calculation\nagent in its sole discretion may determine the\nbusiness day convention, the definition of\nbusiness day and the interest reset date to be\nused and any other relevant methodology for\ncalculating such substitute or successor rate,\nincluding any\nadjustment factor needed to make such\nsubstitute or successor rate comparable to the\ntreasury rate, in a manner that is consistent\nwith any industry-accepted practices for such\nsubstitute or successor rate.\n\nFloating Rate Debt Securities Issued Prior to\nJuly 1, 2020\n\nFor floating rate debt securities issued prior\nto July 1, 2020 for which the base rate is\ntreasury rate, the treasury rate for the\nrelevant interest\nreset date will be the rate for U.S.\ngovernment treasury bills, as that rate\nappears on the Refinitiv page USAUCTION10 or\nUSAUCTION11 on the relevant interest\ndetermination date, opposite the relevant\nindex maturity specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement under the heading\n\u0093INVEST RATE\u0094.\n\nIf the rate described above does not appear on\neither page on the relevant\ninterest calculation date, unless the\ncalculation is made earlier and the rate is\navailable from one of those sources at that\ntime, but U.S. government treasury bills\nhaving the specified index maturity have been\nauctioned during the relevant\ninterest period, then the treasury rate will\nbe the bond equivalent yieldof the rate, for\nthe relevant interest reset date, as published\nin H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized\nelectronic source used for displaying that\nrate, for\nthat day and for the specified index maturity,\nunder a heading indicating that such rate is\nthe \u0093auction high\u0094 rate for United States\ntreasury bills.\n\nIf the rate cannot be determined as described\nin the preceding paragraph, then the treasury\nrate will be the bond equivalent yield of the\nauction rate\nfor treasury bills with a remaining maturity\nequal to the specified index maturity as\nannounced by the United States Treasury.\n\nIf no such auction\nis held for the relevant week, the treasury\nrate will be the rate, for the relevant\ninterest reset date and for treasury bills\nhaving the specified index maturity, as\npublished in H.15 Daily Update, or another\nrecognized electronic source used for\ndisplaying that rate, under the heading \u0093U.S.\ngovernment securities/Treasury bills\n(secondary market)\u0094.\n\nIf the rate described in the\nprior paragraph does not appear in H.15 Daily\nUpdate or another recognized electronic source\non the relevant interest calculation date,\nunless the calculation is made earlier and the\nrate is available from that source at that\ntime, the treasury rate\nwill be the bond equivalent yield of the\narithmetic mean of the following secondary\nmarket bid rates for the issue of treasury\nbills with a remaining maturity closest to the\nspecified index maturity: the rates bid as of\napproximately 3:30 P.M., New\nYork City time, on the relevant interest reset\ndate, by primary U.S. government securities\ndealers in New York City selected by the\ncalculation agent.\n\n41\n\nIf no quotation is provided as described in\nthe preceding paragraph, then the calculation\nagent, after consulting such sources as it\ndeems comparable to any of the foregoing\nsecondary market bids or any display page or\nother U.S. government publication or source,\nor any other source as it deems reasonable\nfrom which to estimate the treasury bills\nauction rate or any of the foregoing secondary\nmarket bid rates, shall determine the treasury\nrate for that interest reset date in its sole\ndiscretion.

That institution may include any\naffiliate of ours, such as GS&Co. The\nprospectus supplement for a particular\nfloating rate debt security or series of debt\nsecurities will name the\ninstitution that we have appointed to act as\nthe calculation agent for that debt security\nas of its original issue date. Unless\notherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, we have initially\nappointed GS&Co. as calculation agent\nfor all the floating rate debt securities that\nwe may issue hereunder. We may appoint a\ndifferent institution to serve as calculation\nagent from time to time after the original\nissue date of the debt security without your\nconsent and without\nnotifying you of the change. Absent manifest\nerror, all determinations of the calculation\nagent will be final and binding on you and us,\nwithout any liability on the part of the\ncalculation agent.\n\nRedemption and Repayment\n\nUnless otherwise\nindicated in your prospectus supplement, your\ndebt security will not be entitled to the\nbenefit of any sinking fund \u0097 that is, we or\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. will not deposit\nmoney on a regular basis into any separate\ncustodial account to\nrepay your debt securities. In addition, we\nwill not be entitled to redeem your debt\nsecurity before its stated maturity unless\nyour prospectus supplement specifies a\nredemption commencement date. You will not be\nentitled to require us to buy your\ndebt security from you, before its stated\nmaturity, unless your prospectus supplement\nspecifies one or more repayment dates.\n\nIf your prospectus\nsupplement specifies a redemption commencement\ndate or a repayment date, it may also specify\none or more redemption prices or repayment\nprices, which may be expressed as a percentage\nof the principal amount of your debt security.\nIt may also specify\none or more redemption periods during which\nthe redemption prices relating to a redemption\nof debt securities during those periods will\napply.\n\nIf\nyour prospectus supplement specifies a\nrepayment date, your debt security will be\nrepayable at the holder\u0092s option on the\nspecified repayment date at the specified\nrepayment price, together with interest\naccrued to but excluding the repayment\ndate.\n\nIf a debt security represented by a global\ndebt security is subject to repayment at the\nholder\u0092s option, the depositary or its\nnominee,\nas the holder, will be the only person that\ncan exercise the right to repayment. Any\nindirect owners who own beneficial interests\nin the global debt security and wish to\nexercise a repayment right must give proper\nand timely instructions to their\nbanks or brokers through which they hold their\ninterests, requesting that they notify the\ndepositary to exercise the repayment right on\ntheir behalf. Different firms have different\ndeadlines for accepting instructions from\ntheir customers, and you\nshould take care to act promptly enough to\nensure that your request is given effect by\nthe depositary before the applicable deadline\nfor exercise.\n\n43\n\nTax redemption.If your prospectus supplement\nspecifies that we will pay additional amounts\nwith respect to your debt securities, as\ndescribed below under \u0093\u0097 Payment of Additional\nAmounts\u0094, we will be entitled, at our option,\nto redeem the outstanding debt securities in\nwhole and not in part if at any time we become\nobligated to pay additional amounts on your\ndebt securities on the next date on which\npayments are made, but only if our obligation\nresults from a change in the laws or\nregulations of any U.S. taxing authority (as\ndefined below in \u0093\u0097 Payment of Additional\nAmounts\u0094), or from a change in any official\ninterpretation or application of those laws or\nregulations, that becomes effective or is\nannounced on or after the date of your\nprospectus supplement, unless another date is\nspecified. If we redeem your debt securities\nbecause we have become obligated to pay\nadditional amounts, we will do so at a\nredemption price equal to 100% of the\nprincipal amount of the debt securities\nredeemed plusaccrued interest to the\nredemption date. If we become entitled to\nredeem your debt securities because we have\nbecome obligated to pay additional amounts, we\nmay do so at any time on a redemption date of\nour choice. However, we must give the holders\nof the debt securities being redeemed notice\nof the redemption not less than 30 days or\nmore than 60 days before the redemption date\nand not more than 90 days before the next date\non which we would be obligated to pay\nadditional amounts. In addition, our\nobligation to pay additional amounts must\nremain in effect when we give the notice of\nredemption. We will give the notice in the\nmanner described below under \u0093\u0097 Notices\u0094.\nOptional redemption.If your prospectus\nsupplement specifies that redemption at our\noption is applicable to your debt securities\nand that a make-whole redemption applies, and\nunless your prospectus supplement specifies\ndifferent terms relating to redemption at our\noption or notice periods:\n                                              \n       we may redeem your debt securities in  \n       whole at any time or in part from      \n       time to time, prior to a specified     \n       final                                  \n       redemption date, upon (i)\u00a0in the case  \n       of debt securities issued prior to     \n       July\u00a01, 2020 (which for this purpose   \n       shall also include new issuances of    \n       Series E Medium-Term Notes or          \n       reopenings of previously issued        \n       Series E Medium-Term Notes),           \n       not less than 30 days\u0092 nor more than    \n       60 days\u0092 prior written notice or (ii)   \n       in the case of debt securities issued  \n       on or after July\u00a01, 2020 (other than   \n       new issuances of Series E Medium-Term  \n       Notes or reopenings of previously      \n       issued                                 \n       Series E Medium-Term Notes), not less  \n       than 15 days\u0092 nor more than 60 days\u0092     \n       prior written notice, at a redemption  \n       price equal to the greater of (A)      \n  (1)  100% of the principal amount of the    \n       debt securities to be redeemed or (B)  \n       as determined                          \n       by the quotation agent described       \n       below, the sum of the present values   \n       of the remaining scheduled payments    \n       of principal and interest on the debt  \n       securities to be redeemed, not         \n       including any portion of these         \n       payments of interest accrued as of     \n       the date                               \n       on which the debt securities are to    \n       be redeemed, discounted to the date    \n       on which the debt securities are to    \n       be redeemed on a semi-annual basis,    \n       applying the 30/360 (ISDA) day count   \n       convention described above, at the     \n       treasury rate (as described            \n       below) plus a spread to be specified   \n       in the prospectus supplement, plus,    \n       in each case, accrued and unpaid       \n       interest to but excluding the          \n       redemption date;

The successor entity    \n      may be organized under the laws of any  \n      jurisdiction, whether in the United     \n      States or elsewhere.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      Immediately after the transaction, no   \n      default under the debt securities of    \n      that series or the related guarantees   \n      has                                     \n      occurred and is continuing.

What    \n      constitutes an event of default under   \n      the 2007 GSFC debt indenture varies     \n      substantially from what constitutes an  \n      event of default under the 2008 GSFC    \n      indenture and the subordinated debt     \n      indenture.                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n46\n\nIf the conditions described above are\nsatisfied with respect to the debt securities\nof any series,\nneither we nor The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nwill need to obtain the approval of the\nholders of those debt securities in order to\nmerge or consolidate or to sell our or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s assets. Also,\nthese conditions will apply\nonly if we or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nwishes to merge or consolidate with another\nentity or sell our or The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc.\u0092s assets substantially as an entirety to\nanother entity. Neither we nor The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc.\nwill need to satisfy these conditions if we or\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. enters into\nother types of transactions, including any\ntransaction in which we or The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. acquire the stock or assets of\nanother entity, any\ntransaction that involves a change of control\nof us or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. but in\nwhich we or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. does\nnot merge or consolidate and any transaction\nin which we or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nsells less than\nsubstantially all our or The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc.\u0092s assets. While we are currently a\nwholly owned subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc., there is no requirement that we\nremain a subsidiary.\n\nAlso, if we or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nmerges, consolidates or sells our or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s assets\nsubstantially as an\nentirety and the successor is a non-U.S.\nentity, neither we nor The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. nor any successor would have any\nobligation to compensate you for any resulting\nadverse tax consequences relating\nto your debt securities.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing and for the\navoidance of doubt, with regard to any\nsecurities of any series issued on or\nafter July 1, 2020 (other than new issuances\nof Series E Medium-Term Notes or reopenings of\npreviously issued Series E Medium-Term Notes)\nunder the 2008 GSFC indenture or any\nsecurities of any series issued under the\nsubordinated debt\nindenture, we may sell or transfer our assets\nsubstantially as an entirety, in one or more\ntransactions, to one or more entities,\nprovided that our assets and the assets of our\ndirect or indirect subsidiaries in which we\nown a majority of the\ncombined voting power, taken together, are not\nsold or transferred substantially as an\nentirety to one or more entities that are not\nmajority-owned subsidiaries of The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc., and The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. may sell or transfer\nits assets substantially as an entirety in one\nor more transactions, to one or more entities,\nprovided that the assets of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. and its direct or indirect\nsubsidiaries in which it owns a majority of\nthe combined voting power,\ntaken together, are not sold or transferred\nsubstantially as an entirety to one or more\nentities that are not such subsidiaries.\n\nSubordination Provisions\n\nHolders of subordinated debt securities should\nrecognize that contractual provisions in the\nsubordinated debt indenture may prohibit\nus and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. from\nmaking payments on those securities.\nSubordinated debt securities will be\nsubordinate and junior in right of payment, to\nthe extent and in the manner stated in the\nsubordinated debt indenture, to all of our\nsenior indebtedness, as will be defined in the\nsubordinated debt indenture, including all\ndebt securities we have issued and will issue\nunder either of the senior debt indentures and\nall warrants that we will issue under the\nwarrant indenture.\n\nThe subordinated debt indenture will define\n\u0093senior indebtedness\u0094 as all indebtedness and\nobligations of, or guaranteed or assumed by,\nus or\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. for borrowed\nmoney or evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes\nor other similar instruments, whether existing\nnow or in the future, and all amendments,\nrenewals, extensions, modifications and\nrefundings of any indebtedness\nor obligations of that kind. Senior debt\nexcludes the subordinated debt securities and\nany other indebtedness or obligations\nspecifically designated as being subordinate,\nor not superior, in right of payment to the\nsubordinated debt securities.\n\n47\n\nWe may modify the subordination provisions,\nincluding the definition of senior\nindebtedness, with respect to one or more\nseries of subordinated debt securities. For a\ndescription of these modifications, see the\napplicable prospectus supplement. The\nsubordinated debt indenture will provide that,\nunless all principal of and any premium or\ninterest on the senior indebtedness of us or\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. has been paid in\nfull, no payment or other distribution by us\nor The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. as the case\nmay be, may be made in respect of any\nsubordinated debt securities in the following\ncircumstances:\n                                              \n      in the event of any insolvency or       \n      bankruptcy proceedings, or any          \n      receivership, liquidation,              \n      reorganization, assignment for          \n      creditors or other similar proceedings  \n      or events involving us or The Goldman   \n      Sachs Group, Inc. or our or its         \n      assets;                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      (a) in the event and during the         \n      continuation of any default in the      \n      payment of principal, premium or        \n      interest on any senior                  \n      indebtedness of us or The Goldman       \n      Sachs Group, Inc. beyond any            \n      applicable grace period or (b)\u00a0in the   \n      event that any event of default with    \n      respect to any such senior              \n      indebtedness has occurred and is        \n      continuing, permitting the holders of   \n      that                                    \n      senior indebtedness (or a trustee) to   \n      accelerate the maturity of that senior  \n      indebtedness, whether or not the        \n      maturity is in fact accelerated         \n      (unless, in the case of (a)\u00a0or (b),     \n      the payment default or event of         \n      default has been cured or waived        \n      or ceased to exist and any related      \n      acceleration has been rescinded) or     \n      (c)\u00a0in the event that any judicial      \n      proceeding is pending with respect to   \n      a payment default or event of default   \n      described in (a)\u00a0or (b); or             \n                                              \n                                              \n      in the event that any of our            \n      subordinated debt securities or that    \n      of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. has    \n      been declared due                       \n      and payable before their stated         \n      maturity.                               \n                                              \nIf the trustee under the subordinated debt\nindenture or any holders of the subordinated\ndebt securities receive any payment or\ndistribution that is prohibited under the\nsubordination provisions, then the trustee or\nthe holders will have to repay that money to\nthe holders of the senior indebtedness. Even\nif the subordination provisions will prevent\nus or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. from\nmaking any payment when due on the\nsubordinated debt securities of any series or\nrelated guarantees, we or The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc., as the case may be, will be in\ndefault on our or its obligations under that\nseries if we or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\ndo not make the payment when due. This means\nthat the trustee under the subordinated debt\nindenture and the holders of that series can\ntake action against us, but they will not\nreceive any money until the claims of the\nholders of senior indebtedness have been fully\nsatisfied. The subordinated debt indenture\nwill allow the holders of senior indebtedness\nto obtain a court order requiring us or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. and any holder of\nsubordinated debt securities to comply with\nthe subordination provisions. Restriction on\nLiens If you are the holder of senior debt\nsecurities issued under the 2007 GSFC\nindenture, then all references to \u0093series\u0094\nunder this subsection entitled \u0093Restriction on\nLiens\u0094 shall also refer to any \u0093tranche\u0094 with\nrespect to your debt securities issued under\nthe 2007 GSFC indenture. In each of the senior\ndebt indentures, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\npromises, with respect to each series of\nsenior debt securities, not to create, assume,\nincur or guarantee any debt for borrowed money\nthat is secured by a lien on the voting or\nprofit participating equity ownership\ninterests that The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nor any of its subsidiaries own in GS&Co., or\nin any subsidiary of The 48\n\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. that beneficially\nowns or holds, directly or indirectly, those\ninterests in GS&Co., unless The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. also secures the senior debt\nsecurities of that series on an equal or\npriority basis with the other secured debt.\nThe promise of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.,\nhowever, is subject to an important exception:\nit may secure debt for borrowed money with\nliens on those interests without securing the\nsenior debt securities of any series if its\nboard of directors determines that the liens\ndo not materially detract from or interfere\nwith the value or control of those interests,\nas of the date of the determination. The\nsubordinated debt indenture will not include\nthe promise described in the preceding\nparagraph. Except as noted above, none of the\ndebt indentures restricts The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc.\u0092s ability to put liens on its\ninterests in its subsidiaries other than\nGS&Co., nor do the debt indentures restrict\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s ability to\nsell or otherwise dispose of its interests in\nany of its subsidiaries, including GS&Co. In\naddition, the restriction on liens in the\nsenior debt indenture applies only to liens\nthat secure debt for borrowed money. For\nexample, liens imposed by operation of law,\nsuch as liens to secure statutory obligations\nfor taxes or workers\u0092 compensation benefits,\nor liens The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. creates\nto secure obligations to pay legal judgments\nor surety bonds, would not be covered by this\nrestriction. Defeasance and Covenant\nDefeasance Unless we say otherwise in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, the\nprovisions for full defeasance and covenant\ndefeasance described below apply to each\nsenior and subordinated debt security and the\nguarantee thereof. In general, we expect these\nprovisions to apply to each debt security that\nhas a specified currency of U.S. dollars and\nis not an indexed debt security. Full\nDefeasance.If there is a change in U.S.\nfederal tax law, as described below, we and\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. can legally\nrelease ourselves from all payment and other\nobligations on any debt securities and the\nguarantees thereof. This is called full\ndefeasance. For us and The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. to do so, each of the following\nmust occur:\n                                              \n      We or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.     \n      must deposit in trust for the benefit   \n      of all holders of those debt            \n      securities (and the                     \n      guarantees thereof) money or a          \n      combination of money and U.S.           \n      government or U.S. government agency    \n      notes or bonds that will generate       \n      enough cash to make interest,           \n      principal and any other payments on     \n      those debt securities on their various  \n      due dates;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      There must be a change in current U.S.  \n      federal tax law or a United States      \n      Internal Revenue Service ruling that    \n      lets us or                              \n      The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. make the  \n      above deposit without causing the       \n      holders to be taxed on those debt       \n      securities any differently than if we   \n      or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. did    \n      not make the deposit and just repaid    \n      those debt securities                   \n      ourselves or itself.

In   \n      that event, you could recognize gain    \n      or loss on your debt security and       \n      guarantee on such debt                  \n      security;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      We or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.     \n      must deliver to the trustee a legal     \n      opinion of our counsel confirming the   \n      tax law                                 \n      change described above; and             \n                                              \n                                              \n      In the case of the subordinated debt    \n      securities, the following requirements  \n      must also be met:                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      No event or condition may exist that,   \n      under the provisions described under \u0093\u0097   \n      Subordination Provisions\u0094                \n      above, would prevent us or The Goldman  \n      Sachs Group,                            \n                                              \n49\n                                              \n  Inc. from making payments of principal,     \n  premium or                                  \n  interest on those subordinated debt         \n  securities on                               \n  the date of the deposit referred to above   \n  or                                          \n  during the 90 days after that date; and     \n                                              \n                                              \n      We or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.     \n      must deliver to the trustee an opinion  \n      of counsel to the effect that (a)\u00a0the   \n      trust                                   \n      funds will not be subject to any        \n      rights of holders of senior             \n      indebtedness and (b)\u00a0after the 90-day   \n      period referred to above, the trust     \n      funds will not be subject to any        \n      applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,      \n      reorganization or similar laws          \n      affecting creditors\u0092 rights generally,   \n      except that if a court were to rule     \n      under any of those laws in any case or  \n      proceeding that the trust funds         \n      remained our property, then the         \n      relevant trustee and the holders of     \n      the subordinated debt securities would  \n      be entitled to some enumerated rights   \n      as secured creditors in the trust       \n      funds.                                  \n                                              \nIf we or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ever\nfully defeased your debt security and\nguarantee on such debt security, you would\nhave to rely solely on the trust deposit for\npayments on your debt security and guarantee\non such debt security.

In\norder to achieve covenant defeasance for any\ndebt securities and guarantees thereof, we or\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. must do both of\nthe following:\n                                              \n      We or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.     \n      must deposit in trust for the benefit   \n      of the holders of those debt            \n      securities (and the                     \n      guarantees thereof) money or a          \n      combination of money and U.S.           \n      government or U.S. government agency    \n      notes or bonds that will generate       \n      enough cash to make interest,           \n      principal and any other payments on     \n      those debt securities on their various  \n      due dates;                              \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      We or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.     \n      must deliver to the trustee a legal     \n      opinion of our counsel confirming that  \n      under                                   \n      current U.S. federal income tax law we  \n      may make the above deposit without      \n      causing the holders to be taxed on      \n      those debt securities any differently   \n      than if we or The Goldman Sachs Group,  \n      Inc. did not make the deposit and just  \n      repaid those debt                       \n      securities ourselves.                   \n                                              \nIn addition, in order to achieve covenant\ndefeasance for any subordinated debt\nsecurities that have the benefit of any\nrestrictive covenants, both conditions\ndescribed in the last bullet point under \u0093\u0097\nFull Defeasance\u0094 above must be satisfied.\nSubordinated debt securities will not have the\nbenefit of any restrictive covenants unless\nthe applicable prospectus supplement\nspecifically provides that they do. If we or\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. accomplish\ncovenant defeasance with regard to your debt\nsecurity and the guarantee on such debt\nsecurity, the following provisions of the\napplicable debt indenture and your debt\nsecurity and guarantee on such debt security\nwould no longer apply:\n                                              \n      If your debt security is a senior debt  \n      security, the promise by The Goldman    \n      Sachs Group, Inc. not to create liens   \n      on its                                  \n      voting or profit participating equity   \n      ownership interests in GS&Co.           \n      described above under \u0093\u0097 Restriction on   \n      Liens\u0094;                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      Any additional covenants that your      \n      prospectus supplement may state are     \n      applicable to your debt security; and   \n                                              \n50\n                                              \n      The events of default or covenant       \n      breaches resulting from a breach of     \n      covenants, described below in the       \n      fourth bullet point                     \n      under \u0093\u0097 Default, Remedies and Waiver of  \n      Default \u0097 Events of Default\u0094 and \u0093\u0097         \n      Covenant Breaches\u0094.                      \n                                              \nAny right we have to redeem will survive\ncovenant defeasance with regard to those debt\nsecurities. If we or The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. accomplish covenant defeasance on your\ndebt security and guarantee on such debt\nsecurity, you can still look to us or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. for repayment of\nyour debt security or guarantee on such debt\nsecurity in the event of any shortfall in the\ntrust deposit. You should note, however, that\nif one of the remaining events of default\noccurred, such as our bankruptcy (or, in the\ncase of the 2007 GSFC indenture only, The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s bankruptcy) and\nyour debt security became immediately due and\npayable, there may be a shortfall. Depending\non the event causing the default, you may not\nbe able to obtain payment of the shortfall.\nDefault, Remedies and Waiver of Default You\nwill have special rights if an event of\ndefault or a covenant breach with respect to\nyour series (or your tranche, in the case of\nsenior debt securities issued under the 2007\nGSFC indenture) of debt securities occurs and\nis continuing, as described in this\nsubsection.

The  \n      notice must be sent by the trustee or   \n      the holders of at least 10% in          \n      principal amount of the relevant        \n      series of debt securities then          \n      outstanding;                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      We file for bankruptcy or other events  \n      of bankruptcy, insolvency or            \n      reorganization relating to us occur.    \n      Those events must                       \n      arise under U.S. federal or state law,  \n      unless we merge, consolidate or sell    \n      our assets as described above and the   \n      successor firm is a non-U.S. entity.    \n      If that happens, then those events      \n      must arise under U.S.                   \n      federal or state law or the law of the  \n      jurisdiction in which the successor     \n      firm is legally organized;              \n                                              \n                                              \n      Except as provided by the relevant      \n      indenture, the debt security of that    \n      series and the related guarantee, the   \n      guarantee                               \n      ceases to be effective, or a court      \n      finds the guarantee to be               \n      unenforceable or invalid, or The        \n      Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. denies its    \n      obligations as the guarantor; or        \n                                              \n                                              \n      If the applicable prospectus            \n      supplement states that any additional   \n      event of default applies to the         \n      series, that event of                   \n      default occurs.                         \n                                              \nWe may change, eliminate or add to the events\nof default with respect to any particular\ntranche or series, as applicable, or any\nparticular debt security or debt securities\nwithin a tranche or series, as applicable, as\nindicated in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. Unless your prospectus supplement\nsays otherwise, although certain events of\nbankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization\nrelating to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the\nguarantor) will constitute an event of default\nwith respect to any tranche of debt securities\nissued under the 2007 GSFC indenture, such\nevents relating to The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. will not constitute an event of default\nwith respect to any series of debt securities\nissued under the 2008 GSFC indenture or the\nsubordinated debt indenture. Similarly, unless\nyour prospectus supplement says otherwise,\nalthough a breach of a covenant or warranty by\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. under the 2007\nGSFC indenture may constitute an event of\ndefault with respect to a tranche of debt\nsecurities issued under the 2007 indenture,\nany breach of a covenant or warranty by The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. under the 2008 GSFC\nindenture or the subordinated debt indenture\n(in each case, other than the breach of any\ncovenant or warranty that is specified therein\nas an event of default) will not constitute an\nevent of default or potential event of default\nwith respect to any series of debt securities\nissued under the 2008 GSFC indenture or the\nsubordinated debt indenture, as applicable.\nTherefore, as described below under \u0093Remedies\nIf an Event of Default or Covenant Breach\nOccurs\u0094, under the 2008 GSFC indenture or the\nsubordinated debt indenture, events of\nbankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization\nrelating to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. will\nnot cause any of GSFC\u0092s debt securities issued\nunder such indentures to be automatically\naccelerated. In the event that The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. becomes subject to certain\nevents of bankruptcy, insolvency or\nreorganization (but GSFC does not), any series\nof debt securities issued under the 2008 GSFC\nindenture or the subordinated debt indenture\nwill not be immediately due and repayable. In\naddition, under the 2008 GSFC indenture or the\nsubordinated debt indenture, a breach of a\ncovenant or warranty by The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. (including, for example, a breach\nof The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s covenants\nand warranties with respect to mergers and\nsimilar transactions or, in the case of the\nsenior 2008 GSFC indenture only, restrictions\non liens, described above under \u0093Mergers and\nSimilar Transactions\u0094 and \u0093Restriction on\nLiens\u0094, respectively) will not have the\npotential to cause any of GSFC\u0092s debt\nsecurities issued under the applicable\nindenture to be declared due and payable\nimmediately. Instead, under the 2008 GSFC 53\n\nindenture or the subordinated debt indenture,\nthe trustee or you will need to wait until the\nearlier of the time that (i) GSFC itself\nbecomes subject to certain events of\nbankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or\notherwise defaults on the terms of the debt\nsecurities, (ii) The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\notherwise defaults on the terms of the debt\nsecurities and (iii) the final maturity of the\ndebt securities. The return you receive on any\nseries of debt securities issued under the\n2008 GSFC indenture or the subordinated debt\nindenture may be significantly less than what\nyou would have otherwise received had the debt\nsecurities been automatically accelerated upon\ncertain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or\nreorganization relating to The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. or declared due and payable\nimmediately following the breach of a covenant\nor warranty by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nAs of December 31, 2020, GSFC had outstanding\n$ aggregate principal amount of debt\nsecurities issued under the 2007 GSFC\nindenture that, for the reasons discussed\nabove, could be accelerated prior to debt\nsecurities issued under the 2008 GSFC\nindenture or the subordinated debt indenture.\nCovenant Breaches Unless your prospectus\nsupplement says otherwise, when we refer to a\ncovenant breach with respect to the debt\nsecurities of any series issued on or after\nJuly 1, 2020 (other than new issuances of\nSeries E Medium-Term Notes or reopenings of\npreviously issued Series E Medium-Term Notes)\nunder the 2008 GSFC indenture and the\nsubordinated debt indenture, we mean the\nfollowing:\n                                              \n      We or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.     \n      does not deposit a sinking fund         \n      payment with regard to any debt         \n      security of that series                 \n      on the due date, but only if the        \n      payment is required under provisions    \n      described in the applicable prospectus  \n      supplement;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      We remain in breach of any covenant we  \n      make in the debt indenture for the      \n      benefit of that series, for 60 days     \n      after we and                            \n      The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. receive   \n      a notice of covenant breach stating     \n      that we are in breach and requiring us  \n      to remedy the breach. The notice must   \n      be sent by the trustee or the holders   \n      of at least 10% in principal amount of  \n      that series of debt                     \n      securities then outstanding; or         \n                                              \n                                              \n      Except as provided by the relevant      \n      indenture, the debt security of that    \n      series and the related guarantee, the   \n      guarantee                               \n      ceases to be effective, or a court      \n      finds the guarantee to be               \n      unenforceable or invalid, or The        \n      Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. denies its    \n      obligations as the guarantor.           \n                                              \nWe may change the definition of covenant\nbreach with respect to any particular series\nor any particular debt security or debt\nsecurities within a series, as indicated in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement. A\ncovenant breach shall not be an event of\ndefault with respect to any security. Remedies\nIf an Event of Default or Covenant Breach\nOccurs If you are the holder of a subordinated\ndebt security, all the remedies available upon\nthe occurrence of an event of default under\nthe subordinated debt indenture will be\nsubject to the restrictions on the\nsubordinated debt securities described above\nunder \u0093\u0097 Subordination Provisions\u0094. If you are\nthe holder of senior debt securities issued\nunder the 2007 GSFC indenture, then all\nreferences to \u0093series\u0094 under this subsection\nentitled \u0093Remedies If an Event of Default or\nCovenant Breach Occurs\u0094 shall instead mean\n\u0093tranche\u0094 with respect to your debt securities\nissued under the 2007 GSFC indenture. Except\nas otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, if an event of default\nhas occurred with respect to any series of\ndebt securities and has not been cured or\nwaived, the trustee or 54\n\nthe holders of not less than 25% in principal\namount of all debt securities of that series\nthen outstanding may declare the entire\nprincipal amount of the debt securities of\nthat series to be due immediately. Except as\notherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, if the event of default\noccurs because of events in bankruptcy,\ninsolvency or reorganization relating to us\n(or, in the case of the 2007 GSFC indenture\nonly, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.), the\nentire principal amount of the debt securities\nof that series will be automatically\naccelerated, without any action by the trustee\nor any holder. Each of the situations\ndescribed above is called an acceleration of\nthe stated maturity of the affected series of\ndebt securities. Except as otherwise specified\nin the applicable prospectus supplement, if\nthe stated maturity of any series is\naccelerated and a judgment for payment has not\nyet been obtained, the holders of a majority\nin principal amount of the debt securities of\nthat series may cancel the acceleration for\nthe entire series. For debt securities issued\non or after July 1, 2020 (other than new\nissuances of Series E Medium-Term Notes or\nreopenings of previously issued Series E\nMedium-Term Notes) under the 2008 GSFC\nindenture, acceleration will not be permitted\nfor reasons other than a specified payment\ndefault or insolvency event that constitutes\nan event of default in respect of such\nsecurities. Neither the trustee nor any\nholders of such securities will have any\nenforcement right or other remedy in respect\nof covenant breaches (including breaches of\nthe covenant described above under \u0093\u0097 Mergers\nand Similar Transactions\u0094) except as described\nbelow. If an event of default (or, with\nrespect to securities issued on or after July\n1, 2020 (other than new issuances of Series E\nMedium-Term Notes or reopenings of previously\nissued Series E Medium-Term Notes) under the\n2008 GSFC indenture, a covenant breach)\noccurs, the trustee will have special duties.\nIn that situation, the trustee will be\nobligated to use those of its rights and\npowers under the relevant debt indenture, and\nto use the same degree of care and skill in\ndoing so, that a prudent person would use in\nthat situation in conducting his or her own\naffairs. Except as described in the prior\nparagraph, the trustee is not required to take\nany action under the relevant debt indenture\nat the request of any holders unless the\nholders offer the trustee reasonable\nprotection from expenses and liability. This\nis called an indemnity. If the trustee is\nprovided with an indemnity reasonably\nsatisfactory to it, the holders of a majority\nin principal amount of all debt securities of\nthe relevant series may direct the time,\nmethod and place of conducting any lawsuit or\nother formal legal action seeking any remedy\navailable to the trustee with respect to that\nseries. These majority holders may also direct\nthe trustee in performing any other action\nunder the applicable debt indenture with\nrespect to the debt securities of that series.\nBefore you bypass the trustee and bring your\nown lawsuit or other formal legal action or\ntake other steps to enforce your rights or\nprotect your interests relating to any debt\nsecurity, all of the following must occur:\n                                              \n      The holder of your debt security must   \n      give the trustee written notice that    \n      an event of default (or, with respect   \n      to                                      \n      securities issued on or after July\u00a01,   \n      2020 (other than new issuances of       \n      Series E Medium-Term Notes or           \n      reopenings of previously issued Series  \n      E Medium-Term Notes) under the 2008     \n      GSFC indenture, a covenant breach) has  \n      occurred, and the event of              \n      default (or covenant breach) must not   \n      have been cured or waived;              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n      The holders of not less than 25% in     \n      principal amount of all debt            \n      securities of your series must make a   \n      written request that                    \n      the trustee take action because of the  \n      default (or breach), and they or other  \n      holders must offer to the trustee       \n      indemnity reasonably satisfactory to    \n      the trustee against the cost and other  \n      liabilities of taking that action;      \n                                              \n55\n                                              \n      The trustee must not have taken action  \n      for 60 days after the above steps have  \n      been taken; and                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      During those 60 days, the holders of a  \n      majority in principal amount of the     \n      debt securities of your series must     \n      not have                                \n      given the trustee directions that are   \n      inconsistent with the written request   \n      of the holders of not less than 25% in  \n      principal amount of the debt            \n      securities of your series.              \n                                              \nYou are entitled at any time, however, to\nbring a lawsuit for the payment of money due\non your debt security on or after its stated\nmaturity (or, if your debt security is\nredeemable, on or after its redemption date).\nWaiver of Default The holders of not less than\na majority in principal amount of the debt\nsecurities of any series (or of any tranche,\nin the case of senior debt securities issued\nunder the 2007 GSFC indenture) may waive a\ndefault for all debt securities of that series\n(or of that tranche, in the case of senior\ndebt securities issued under the 2007 GSFC\nindenture). If this happens, the default will\nbe treated as if it has not occurred. No one\ncan waive a payment default on your debt\nsecurity, however, without the approval of the\nparticular holder of that debt security. For\nthe purpose of this paragraph, the term\n\u0093default\u0094 means any event which is, or after\nnotice or lapse of time or both would become,\nan event of default or covenant breach in\nrespect of the relevant securities. We and The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. Will Give the\nTrustee Information About Defaults Annually We\nand The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. will furnish\nto each trustee every year a written\nstatement, respectively, of two of our or its\nofficers certifying that to their knowledge we\nor The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., as the case\nmay be, is in compliance with the applicable\ndebt indenture and the debt securities issued\nunder it, or else specifying any default under\nthe relevant debt indenture. For the purpose\nof this paragraph, the term \u0093default\u0094 means\nany event which is, or after notice or lapse\nof time or both would become, an event of\ndefault or covenant breach in respect of the\nrelevant securities. Book-entry and other\nindirect owners should consult their banks or\nbrokers for information on how to give notice\nor direction to or make a request of the\ntrustee and how to declare or cancel an\nacceleration of the stated maturity. Book-\nentry and other indirect owners are described\nbelow under \u0093Legal Ownership and Book-Entry\nIssuance\u0094. Modification of the Debt Indentures\nand Waiver of Covenants There are four types\nof changes we and The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. can make to the debt indentures and the\ndebt securities or series of debt securities\nand related guarantees issued under a\nparticular debt indenture. Changes Requiring\nEach Holder\u0092s Approval First, there are\nchanges that cannot be made without the\napproval of the holder of each debt security\naffected by the change under the applicable\ndebt indenture. Here is a list of those types\nof changes:\n                                              \n      change the stated maturity for any      \n      principal or interest payment on a      \n      debt security;                          \n                                              \n56\n                                              \n      reduce the principal amount, the        \n      amount payable on acceleration of the   \n      stated maturity after a default, the    \n      interest rate                           \n      or the redemption price for a debt      \n      security;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      permit redemption of a debt security    \n      if not previously permitted;            \n                                              \n                                              \n      impair any right a holder may have to   \n      require repayment of its debt           \n      security;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      change the currency of any payment on   \n      a debt security;                        \n                                              \n                                              \n      change the place of payment on a debt   \n      security;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      impair a holder\u0092s right to sue for       \n      payment of any amount due on its debt   \n      security;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      reduce the percentage in principal      \n      amount of the debt securities of any    \n      one or more affected series (or         \n      affected tranche,                       \n      in the case of senior debt securities   \n      issued under the 2007 GSFC indenture),  \n      taken separately or together, as        \n      applicable, and whether comprising the  \n      same or different series or less than   \n      all of the debt securities of a         \n      series, the approval of whose           \n      holders is needed to change the         \n      applicable debt indenture or those      \n      debt securities;                        \n                                              \n                                              \n      reduce the percentage in principal      \n      amount of the debt securities of any    \n      one or more affected series (or         \n      affected tranche,                       \n      in the case of senior debt securities   \n      issued under the 2007 GSFC indenture),  \n      taken separately or together, as        \n      applicable, and whether comprising the  \n      same or different series or less than   \n      all of the debt securities of a         \n      series, the consent of whose            \n      holders is needed to waive our          \n      compliance with the applicable debt     \n      indenture or to waive defaults; and     \n                                              \n                                              \n      change the provisions of the            \n      applicable debt indenture dealing with  \n      modification and waiver in any other    \n      respect, except to                      \n      increase any required percentage        \n      referred to above or to add to the      \n      provisions that cannot be changed or    \n      waived without approval of the holder   \n      of each affected debt security.         \n                                              \nChanges Not Requiring Approval The second type\nof change does not require any approval by\nholders of the debt securities affected. These\nchanges are limited to clarifications and\nchanges that would not adversely affect any\ndebt securities of any series in any material\nrespect. Neither we nor The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. needs any approval to make changes\nthat affect only debt securities to be issued\nunder the applicable indenture after the\nchanges take effect. We and The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. may also make changes or obtain\nwaivers that do not adversely affect a\nparticular debt security, even if they affect\nother debt securities. In those cases, neither\nwe nor The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. needs to\nobtain the approval of the holder of the\nunaffected debt security; we and The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. need only obtain any\nrequired approvals from the holders of the\naffected debt securities. Modification of\nSubordination Provisions The subordinated debt\nindenture will provide that neither we nor The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. may amend the\nsubordinated debt indenture to alter the\nsubordination of any outstanding subordinated\ndebt securities without the written consent of\neach holder of the then outstanding senior\nindebtedness of us and The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. who would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the subordinated debt indenture\nwill provide that neither we nor The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. may modify the subordination\nprovisions of the subordinated debt indenture\nin a manner that would adversely affect the\nsubordinated debt securities of any one or\nmore series then outstanding in any material\nrespect, without the consent of the holders of\na majority in aggregate principal amount of\nall affected series then outstanding, voting\ntogether as one class (and also of any\naffected series that by its terms is entitled\nto vote separately as a series, as described\nbelow). 57\n\nChanges Requiring Majority Approval Any other\nchange to the 2007 GSFC indenture and the debt\nsecurities issued under that indenture would\nrequire the following approval:\n                                              \n      If the change affects only the debt     \n      securities of a particular tranche, it  \n      must be approved by the holders of a    \n      majority in                             \n      principal amount of the debt            \n      securities of that tranche.             \n                                              \n                                              \n      If the change affects the debt          \n      securities of more than one tranche of  \n      debt securities, it must be approved    \n      by the holders                          \n      of a majority in principal amount of    \n      all tranches affected by the change,    \n      with the debt securities of all the     \n      affected tranches voting together as    \n      one class for this purpose (and of any  \n      affected tranche that by its terms is   \n      entitled to vote                        \n      separately as a tranche, as described   \n      below).                                 \n                                              \nOn the other hand, any other change to either\nthe 2008 GSFC indenture or the subordinated\ndebt indenture and the debt securities issued\nunder either such debt indenture would require\nthe following approval:\n                                              \n      If the change affects only particular   \n      debt securities within a series, it     \n      must be approved by the holders of a    \n      majority in                             \n      principal amount of such particular     \n      debt securities.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n      If the change affects multiple debt     \n      securities of one or more series, it    \n      must be approved by the holders of a    \n      majority in                             \n      principal amount of all debt            \n      securities affected by the change,      \n      with all such affected debt securities  \n      voting together as one class for this   \n      purpose (and by the holders of a        \n      majority in principal amount of any     \n      affected debt securities that by their  \n      terms are entitled to vote separately   \n      as described below).                    \n                                              \nIn each case, the required approval must be\ngiven by written consent. This would mean that\nmodification of terms with respect to certain\ndebt securities of a series could be\neffectuated under any debt indenture without\nobtaining the consent of the holders of a\nmajority in principal amount of other\nsecurities of such series that are not\naffected by such modification. The same\nmajority approval would be required for us to\nobtain a waiver of any of our covenants in any\ndebt indenture. Our covenants include the\npromises we and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nmake about merging and, with respect to The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., putting liens on\nour interests in GS&Co., which we describe\nabove under \u0093\u0097 Mergers and Similar\nTransactions\u0094 and \u0093\u0097 Restriction on Liens\u0094,\nand which, in the latter case, are only for\nthe benefit of the holders of The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc.\u0092s senior debt securities. If\nthe holders approve a waiver of a covenant,\nneither we nor The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nwill have to comply with it. The holders,\nhowever, cannot approve a waiver of any\nprovision in a particular debt security, or in\nthe applicable debt indenture as it affects\nthat debt security, that neither we nor The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. can change without\nthe approval of the holder of that debt\nsecurity as described above in \u0093\u0097 Changes\nRequiring Each Holder\u0092s Approval\u0094, unless that\nholder approves the waiver. Book-entry and\nother indirect owners should consult their\nbanks or brokers for information on how\napproval may be granted or denied if we and\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. seek to change a\ndebt indenture or any debt securities or\nrequest a waiver. Special Rules for Action by\nHolders When holders take any action under any\ndebt indenture, such as giving a notice of\ndefault, notice of covenant breach, declaring\nan acceleration, approving any change or\nwaiver or giving the trustee an instruction,\nwe will apply the following rules. 58\n\nOnly Outstanding Debt Securities Are Eligible\nOnly holders of outstanding debt securities or\nthe outstanding debt securities of the\napplicable series, as applicable, will be\neligible to participate in any action by\nholders of such debt securities or the debt\nsecurities of that series. Also, we will count\nonly outstanding debt securities in\ndetermining whether the various percentage\nrequirements for taking action have been met.\nFor these purposes, a debt security will not\nbe \u0093outstanding\u0094 if:\n                                              \n      it has been surrendered for             \n      cancellation;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      we have deposited or set aside, in      \n      trust for its holder, money for its     \n      payment or redemption;                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      we have fully defeased it as described  \n      above under \u0093\u0097 Defeasance and Covenant    \n      Defeasance \u0097 Full                        \n      Defeasance\u0094; or                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      we or one of our affiliates, such as    \n      GS&Co., is the owner.                   \n                                              \nSpecial Class Voting Rights With respect to\nthe 2007 GSFC indenture, we may issue tranches\nof debt securities that are entitled, by their\nterms, to vote separately on matters (for\nexample, modification or waiver of provisions\nin the 2007 GSFC indenture) that would\notherwise require a vote of all affected\ntranches, voting together as a single class.\nAny such tranche would be entitled to vote\ntogether with all other affected tranches,\nvoting together as one class, and would also\nbe entitled to vote separately, as one tranche\nonly. In some cases, other parties may be\nentitled to exercise these special voting\nrights on behalf of the holders of the\nrelevant tranche. For tranches of debt\nsecurities that have these rights, the rights\nwill be described in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. For tranches that do not have\nthese special rights, voting will occur as\ndescribed in the preceding section, but\nsubject to any separate voting rights of any\nother tranches having special rights. We may\nissue tranches having these or other special\nvoting rights without obtaining the consent of\nor giving notice to holders of outstanding\ntranches. With respect to the 2008 GSFC\nindenture and the subordinated debt indenture,\nwe may issue particular debt securities or a\nparticular series of debt securities, as\napplicable, that are entitled, by their terms,\nto vote separately on matters (for example,\nmodification or waiver of provisions in the\napplicable indenture) that would otherwise\nrequire a vote of all affected debt securities\nor all affected series voting together as a\nsingle class. Any such debt securities or\nseries of debt securities would be entitled to\nvote together with all other affected debt\nsecurities or affected series voting together\nas one class, and would also be entitled to\nvote separately as one class only. In some\ncases, other parties may be entitled to\nexercise these special voting rights on behalf\nof the holders of the relevant debt securities\nor the relevant series. For debt securities or\nseries of debt securities that have these\nrights, the rights will be described in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. For debt\nsecurities or series of debt securities that\ndo not have these special rights, voting will\noccur as described in the preceding section,\nbut subject to any separate voting rights of\nany other debt securities or series of debt\nsecurities having special rights. We may issue\nseries having these or other special voting\nrights without obtaining the consent of or\ngiving notice to holders of outstanding debt\nsecurities or series. Eligible Principal\nAmount of Some Debt Securities In some\nsituations, we may follow special rules in\ncalculating the principal amount of debt\nsecurities that are to be treated as\noutstanding for the purposes described above.\nThis may happen, for example, if the principal\namount is payable in a non-U.S.dollar\ncurrency, increases over time or is not to be\nfixed until maturity. 59\n\nFor any debt security of the kind described\nbelow, we will decide how much principal\namount to attribute to the debt security as\nfollows:\n                                              \n      For an original issue discount debt     \n      security, we will use the principal     \n      amount that would be due and payable    \n      on the action                           \n      date if the maturity of the debt        \n      security were accelerated to that date  \n      because of a default;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n      For a debt security whose principal     \n      amount is not known, we will use any    \n      amount that we indicate in the          \n      prospectus                              \n      supplement for that debt security. The  \n      principal amount of a debt security     \n      may not be known, for example, because  \n      it is based on an index that changes    \n      from time to time and the principal     \n      amount is not to be determined until a  \n      later date; or                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      For debt securities with a principal    \n      amount denominated in one or more       \n      non-U.S.                                \n      dollar currencies or currency units,    \n      we will use the U.S. dollar             \n      equivalent, which we will determine.    \n                                              \nDetermining Record Dates for Action by Holders\nWe and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. will\ngenerally be entitled to set any day as a\nrecord date for the purpose of determining the\nholders that are entitled to take action under\na particular debt indenture. In certain\nlimited circumstances, only the trustee will\nbe entitled to set a record date for action by\nholders. If we, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nor the trustee set a record date for an\napproval or other action to be taken by\nholders, that vote or action may be taken only\nby persons or entities who are holders on the\nrecord date and must be taken during the\nperiod that we specify for this purpose, or\nthat the trustee specifies if it sets the\nrecord date. We, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nor the trustee, as applicable, may shorten or\nlengthen this period from time to time. This\nperiod, however, may not extend beyond the\n180th day after the record date for the\naction. In addition, record dates for any\nglobal debt security may be set in accordance\nwith procedures established by the depositary\nfrom time to time. Accordingly, record dates\nfor global debt securities may differ from\nthose for other debt securities. Form,\nExchange and Transfer of Debt Securities If\nany debt securities cease to be issued in\nregistered global form, they will be issued:\n                                      \n      only in fully registered form;  \n                                      \n                                     \n      without interest coupons; and  \n                                     \n                                              \n      unless we indicate otherwise in your    \n      prospectus supplement, in               \n      denominations of $1,000 and integral    \n      multiples of $1,000 in                  \n      excess thereof.                         \n                                              \nHolders may exchange their debt securities for\ndebt securities of smaller denominations or\ncombined into fewer debt securities of larger\ndenominations, as long as the total principal\namount is not changed. You may not exchange\nyour debt securities for securities of a\ndifferent series (or tranche, in the case of\nsenior debt securities issued under the 2007\nGSFC indenture) or having different terms,\nunless your prospectus supplement says you\nmay. Holders may exchange or transfer their\ndebt securities at the office of the trustee.\nThey may also replace lost, stolen, destroyed\nor mutilated debt securities at that office.\nWe have appointed the trustee to act as our\nagent for registering senior debt securities\nin the names of holders and transferring and\nreplacing debt securities and will do the same\nwith respect to subordinated debt securities.\nWe may appoint another entity to perform these\nfunctions or perform them ourselves. Holders\nwill not be required to pay a service charge\nto transfer or exchange their debt securities,\nbut they may be required to pay for any tax or\nother governmental charge associated with the\n60\n\nexchange or transfer. The transfer or\nexchange, and any replacement, will be made\nonly if our transfer agent is satisfied with\nthe holder\u0092s proof of legal ownership. The\ntransfer agent may require an indemnity before\nreplacing any debt securities. If we have\ndesignated additional transfer agents for your\ndebt security, they will be named in your\nprospectus supplement. We may appoint\nadditional transfer agents or cancel the\nappointment of any particular transfer agent.\nWe may also approve a change in the office\nthrough which any transfer agent acts. If the\ndebt securities of any series (or tranche, in\nthe case of senior debt securities issued\nunder the 2007 GSFC indenture) are redeemable\nand we redeem less than all those debt\nsecurities, we may block the transfer or\nexchange of those debt securities during the\nperiod beginning 15 calendar days before the\nday we mail the notice of redemption and\nending on the day of that mailing, in order to\nfreeze the list of holders to prepare the\nmailing. We may also refuse to register\ntransfers of or exchange any debt security\nselected for redemption, except that we will\ncontinue to permit transfers and exchanges of\nthe unredeemed portion of any debt security\nbeing partially redeemed. If a debt security\nis issued as a global debt security, only the\ndepositary \u0097 e.g., DTC, Euroclear or\nClearstream \u0097 will be entitled to transfer and\nexchange the debt security as described in\nthis subsection, since the depositary will be\nthe sole holder of the debt security. Payment\nof Additional Amounts We intend to make all\npayments on the debt securities without\ndeducting U.S. withholding taxes unless the\nlaw requires us to deduct withholding taxes.\nThe remainder of this subsection does not\napply unless the relevant prospectus\nsupplement specifies that this subsection\nentitled \u0093\u0097 Payment of Additional Amounts\u0094 is\napplicable to your debt securities. If we are\nrequired by law to deduct U.S. withholding\ntaxes on payments to non-U.S.investors and if\nso specified in your prospectus supplement, we\nwill pay additional amounts on those payments\nto the extent described in this subsection. We\nwill pay additional amounts on a debt security\nonly if the beneficial owner of the debt\nsecurity is a United States alien. The term\n\u0093United States alien\u0094 means any person who,\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes, is:\n                                       \n      a nonresident alien individual;  \n                                       \n                              \n      a foreign corporation;  \n                              \n                                              \n      a foreign partnership one or more of    \n      the members of which is, for U.S.       \n      federal income tax purposes, a foreign  \n      corporation,                            \n      a nonresident alien individual or a     \n      nonresident alien fiduciary of a        \n      foreign estate or trust; or             \n                                              \n                                              \n      a nonresident alien fiduciary of an     \n      estate or trust that is not subject to  \n      U.S. federal income tax on a net        \n      income basis on                         \n      income or gain from a debt security.    \n                                              \nIf the beneficial owner of a debt security is\na United States alien, we will pay all\nadditional amounts that may be necessary so\nthat every net payment of interest or\nprincipal on that debt security will not be\nless than the amount provided for in that debt\nsecurity. By net payment, we mean the amount\nwe or our paying agent pays after deducting or\nwithholding an amount for or on account of any\npresent or future tax, assessment or other\ngovernmental charge imposed with respect to\nthat payment by a U.S. taxing authority. 61\n\nOur obligation to pay additional amounts is\nsubject to several important exceptions,\nhowever. We will not pay additional amounts\nfor or on account of any of the following:\n                                              \n      any tax, assessment or other            \n      governmental charge imposed solely      \n      because at any time there is or was a   \n      connection between                      \n      the beneficial owner \u0097 or between a      \n      fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,        \n      shareholder or member of the            \n      beneficial owner, if the beneficial     \n      owner is an estate, trust, partnership  \n      or corporation \u0097 and the United States   \n      (other than the mere                    \n      receipt of a payment or the ownership   \n      or holding of a debt security),         \n      including because the beneficial owner  \n      \u0097 or the fiduciary, settlor,             \n      beneficiary, shareholder or member \u0097 at  \n      any time, for U.S. federal income tax   \n      purposes:                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      is or was a citizen or resident or is   \n      or was treated as a resident of the     \n      United States;

If\ninterest is due at\nmaturity but on a day that is not an interest\npayment date, we or The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. will pay the interest to the person\nentitled to receive the principal of the debt\nsecurity. If principal or another amount\nbesides interest is due on a\ndebt security at maturity, we or The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. will pay the amount to the\nholder of the debt security against surrender\nof the debt security at a proper place of\npayment or, in the case of a global debt\nsecurity, in accordance with\nthe applicable policies of the depositary,\nDTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable.\n\nPayment and Record Dates for Interest\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, interest on any fixed\nrate debt security will be payable\nsemiannually each\nMay 15 and November 15 and at maturity, and\nthe regular record date relating to an\ninterest payment date for any fixed rate debt\nsecurity will be the May 1 or November 1\npreceding that interest payment date. Unless\nwe specify\notherwise in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, the regular record date relating\nto an interest payment date for any floating\nrate debt security will be the 15th calendar\nday before that interest payment date. These\nrecord dates will apply\nregardless of whether a particular record date\nis a \u0093business day\u0094, as defined below. For the\npurpose of determining the holder at the close\nof business on a regular record date when\nbusiness is not being conducted, the close of\nbusiness\nwill mean 5:00 P.M., New York City time, on\nthat day.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, and unless\nspecified otherwise in your prospectus\nsupplement,\nthe regular record date relating to an\ninterest payment date for any debt security in\nbook-entry or global form will be the day\nimmediately prior to the day on which the\ninterest payment is to be made (as such\npayment day may be adjusted under the\napplicable business day convention). This\nprior day will be the record date whether or\nnot it is a business day.\n\n63\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in this prospectus\nor in the applicable prospectus supplement,\nthe term\n\u0093days\u0094 refers to calendar days.\n\nHow We or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Will\nMake Payments Due in U.S. Dollars\n\nWe or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. will\nfollow the practice described in this\nsubsection when paying amounts due in U.S.\ndollars.

Under those\npolicies, we or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nwill pay directly to the depositary, or\nits nominee, and not to any indirect owners\nwho own beneficial interests in the global\ndebt security. An indirect owner\u0092s right to\nreceive those payments will be governed by the\nrules and practices of the depositary and its\nparticipants, as\ndescribed below in the section entitled \u0093Legal\nOwnership and Book-Entry Issuance \u0097 What Is a\nGlobal Security?\u0094\n\nPayments on Non-GlobalDebt Securities.We or\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. will make\npayments on a debt security in non-global,\nregistered form as follows. We or The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. will pay interest that is\ndue on an interest payment date by check\nmailed on the interest payment date to the\nholder at his or her address shown on the\ntrustee\u0092s records as of the close of business\non the regular record date.\nWe or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. will make\nall other payments by check or via wire\ntransfer at the paying agent described below,\nagainst surrender of the debt security. All\npayments by check will be made in\nnext-day funds \u0097 i.e., funds that become\navailable on the day after the check is cashed\nor wire transfer is completed.\n\nAlternatively, if a non-global debt security\nhas a principal amount of at least $1,000,000\n(or the equivalent in\nanother currency) and the holder asks us to do\nso, we or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. will\npay any amount that becomes due on the debt\nsecurity by wire transfer of immediately\navailable funds to an account at a bank in New\nYork City, on the due\ndate. To request wire payment, the holder must\ngive the paying agent appropriate wire\ntransfer instructions at least five business\ndays before the requested wire payment is due.\nIn the case of any interest payment due on an\ninterest payment date,\nthe instructions must be given by the person\nor entity who is the holder on the relevant\nregular record date. In the case of any other\npayment, payment will be made only after the\ndebt security is surrendered to the paying\nagent. Any wire\ninstructions, once properly given, will remain\nin effect unless and until new instructions\nare given in the manner described above.\n\nBook-entry and other indirect owners should\nconsult their banks or brokers for information\non how they will receive payments on their\ndebt securities.\n\nHow We or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

We or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nwill make these payments by wire\ntransfer of immediately available funds to any\naccount that is maintained in the applicable\nspecified currency at a bank designated by the\nholder and is acceptable to us or The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. and the trustee. To\ndesignate an account for\nwire payment, the holder must give the paying\nagent appropriate wire instructions at least\nfive business days before the requested wire\npayment is due. In the case of any interest\npayment due on an interest payment date, the\ninstructions must be\ngiven by the person or entity who is the\nholder on the regular record date. In the case\nof any other payment, the payment will be made\nonly after the debt security is surrendered to\nthe paying agent. Any instructions, once\nproperly given, will\nremain in effect unless and until new\ninstructions are properly given in the manner\ndescribed above.\n\nIf a holder fails to give instructions as\ndescribed above, we or The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. will notify the holder at the\naddress in the trustee\u0092s records and will make\nthe payment within five business days after\nthe holder provides appropriate instructions.\nAny late payment made in\nthese circumstances will be treated under the\napplicable debt indenture as if made on the\ndue date, and no interest will accrue on the\nlate payment from the due date to the date\npaid.\n\nAlthough a payment on a debt security in non-\nglobal form may be due in a specified currency\nother than U.S.\ndollars, we or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nwill make the payment in U.S. dollars if your\nprospectus supplement specifies that holders\nmay ask us to do so and you make such a\nrequest. To request U.S. dollar payment in\nthese circumstances, the\nholder must provide appropriate written notice\nto the trustee at least five business days\nbefore the next due date for which payment in\nU.S. dollars is requested. In the case of any\ninterest payment due on an interest payment\ndate, the request must\nbe made by the person or entity who is the\nholder on the regular record date. Any\nrequest, once properly made, will remain in\neffect unless and until revoked by notice\nproperly given in the manner described above.\n\nBook-entry and other indirect owners of a debt\nsecurity with a specified currency other than\nU.S. dollars should contact their banks or\nbrokers for information about how to receive\npayments in the specified currency or in U.S.\ndollars.\n\nConversion to U.S. Dollars.Unless otherwise\nindicated in your prospectus supplement,\nholders are not entitled to receive payments\nin U.S.\ndollars of an amount due in another currency,\neither on a global debt security or a non-\nglobal debt security.\n\nIf your prospectus supplement specifies that\nholders may request that we make payments in\nU.S. dollars of an amount due in another\ncurrency, the\nexchange rate agent described below will\ncalculate the U.S. dollar amount the holder\nreceives in the exchange rate agent\u0092s\ndiscretion. A holder that requests payment in\nU.S. dollars will bear all associated currency\nexchange costs, which will\nbe deducted from the payment.\n\nWhen the Specified Currency Is Not\nAvailable.If we or The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. is obligated to\nmake any payment in a specified currency other\nthan U.S. dollars, and the specified currency\nor any successor currency is not available to\nus or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. due to\n\n65\n\ncircumstances beyond our or its control \u0097 such\nas the imposition of exchange controls or a\ndisruption in the currency markets \u0097 we or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. will be entitled to\nsatisfy our obligation to make the payment in\nthat specified currency by making the payment\nin U.S. dollars, on the basis of the exchange\nrate determined by the exchange rate agent\ndescribed below, in its discretion.\n\nThe foregoing will apply to any debt security,\nwhether in global or non-global form, and to\nany payment,\nincluding a payment at maturity. Any payment\nmade under the circumstances and in a manner\ndescribed above will not result in a default\nunder any debt security or the applicable debt\nindenture.\n\nExchange Rate Agent.If we issue a debt\nsecurity in a specified currency other than\nU.S. dollars, we will appoint a financial\ninstitution\nto act as the exchange rate agent and will\nname the institution initially appointed when\nthe debt security is originally issued in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. We may\nselect GS&Co. or another of our affiliates to\nperform this role. We\nmay change the exchange rate agent from time\nto time after the original issue date of the\ndebt security without your consent and without\nnotifying you of the change.\n\nAll determinations made by the exchange rate\nagent will be in its sole discretion unless we\nstate in the applicable prospectus supplement\nthat any\ndetermination requires our approval. In the\nabsence of manifest error, those\ndeterminations will be conclusive for all\npurposes and binding on you and us, without\nany liability on the part of the exchange rate\nagent.\n\nPayment When Offices Are Closed\n\nUnless specified\notherwise in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, if any payment is due on a debt\nsecurity on a day that is not a business day,\nwe or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. will make\nthe payment on the next business day. Payments\npostponed to the next\nbusiness day in this situation will be treated\nunder the applicable debt indenture as if they\nwere made on the original due date.\nPostponement of this kind will not result in a\ndefault under any debt security or the\napplicable debt indenture, and,\nunless otherwise specified on the applicable\nprospectus supplement, no interest will accrue\non the postponed amount from the original due\ndate to the next business day. The term\nbusiness day has a special meaning, which we\ndescribe above under\n\u0093\u0097 Payment and Record Dates for Interest\u0094.\n\nPaying Agent\n\nWe may appoint one or more financial\ninstitutions to act as our or The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc.\u0092s paying agents, at whose\ndesignated offices debt\nsecurities in non-global entry form may be\nsurrendered for payment at their maturity. We\ncall each of those offices a paying agent. We\nmay add, replace or terminate paying agents\nfrom time to time. We may also\nchoose to act as our own paying agent.\nInitially, we have appointed the trustee, at\nits corporate trust office in New York City,\nas the paying agent. We must notify the\ntrustee of changes in the paying agents.\n\nUnclaimed Payments\n\nRegardless of who acts as paying\nagent, all money paid by us to a paying agent\nthat remains unclaimed at the end of two years\nafter the amount is due to a holder will be\nrepaid to us. After that two-year period, the\nholder may look only to us\nor The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. for payment\nand not to the trustee, any other paying agent\nor anyone else.\n\n66\n\nNotices Notices to be given to holders of a\nglobal debt security will be given only to the\ndepositary, in accordance with its applicable\npolicies as in effect from time to time.\nNotices to be given to holders of debt\nsecurities not in global form will be sent by\nmail to the respective addresses of the\nholders as they appear in the trustee\u0092s\nrecords, and will be deemed given when mailed.\nNeither the failure to give any notice to a\nparticular holder, nor any defect in a notice\ngiven to a particular holder, will affect the\nsufficiency of any notice given to another\nholder. Book-entry and other indirect owners\nshould consult their banks or brokers for\ninformation on how they will receive notices.\nGuarantee by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. will fully and\nunconditionally guarantee the payment of\nprincipal of, and any interest and premium on,\nthe debt securities, when due and payable,\nwhether at the stated maturity, by declaration\nof acceleration, call for redemption or\notherwise, in accordance with the terms of the\nsecurity, the relevant debt indenture and the\napplicable prospectus supplement accompanying\nthis prospectus. The guarantee will remain in\neffect until the entire principal of, and\ninterest and premium, if any, on, the debt\nsecurities has been paid in full or discharged\nin accordance with the provisions of the\nrelevant indenture, or otherwise fully\ndefeased by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nBecause The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a\nholding company, its ability to perform its\nobligations on the guarantees of our debt\nsecurities will depend in part on its ability\nto participate in distributions of assets from\nits subsidiaries. We discuss these matters\nabove under \u0093Prospectus Summary \u0097 The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. is a Holding Company\u0094.\nGuarantee of Debt Securities of GS Finance\nCorp. Issued under the Senior Debt Indentures\nThe guarantee by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nof our debt securities issued under either of\nthe senior debt indentures will rank equally\nin right of payment with all senior\nindebtedness of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nGuarantee of Debt Securities of GS Finance\nCorp. to Be Issued under the Subordinated Debt\nIndenture The guarantee by The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. of our debt securities to be\nissued under the subordinated debt indenture\nwill be subordinate and junior in right of\npayment to all senior indebtedness of The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. No payment of the\nprincipal of, or interest or premium on, such\nsubordinated debt securities may be made by\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. under the terms\nof the subordinated guarantee provision to be\nincluded in the subordinated debt indenture\nuntil all holders of senior indebtedness of\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. have been paid,\nif any of the following occurs:\n                                              \n      certain events of bankruptcy,           \n      insolvency or reorganization of The     \n      Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.;              \n                                              \n                                              \n      any senior indebtedness of The Goldman  \n      Sachs Group, Inc. is not paid when due  \n      (after the expiration of any            \n      applicable grace                        \n      period, if any) and that default        \n      continues without cure or waiver; or    \n                                              \n                                              \n      any other default has occurred and      \n      continues without cure or waiver        \n      (after the expiration of any            \n      applicable grace period,                \n      if any) pursuant to which the holders   \n      of senior indebtedness of The Goldman   \n      Sachs Group, Inc. are permitted to      \n      accelerate the maturity of such senior  \n      indebtedness.                           \n                                              \n67\n\nUpon any distribution of our or The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc.\u0092s assets to our or its\ncreditors in\nconnection with any insolvency, bankruptcy or\nsimilar proceeding, all principal of, and\npremium, if any, and interest due or to become\ndue on all of its senior indebtedness must be\npaid in full before the holders of the\nsubordinated debt securities\nare entitled to receive or retain any payment\nfrom such distribution.\n\nThe subordinated debt indenture will not limit\nthe aggregate amount of senior\nindebtedness that may be issued.\n\nPursuant to the subordination provisions to be\nincluded in the subordinated debt indenture,\nany payment, which\nwould otherwise (but for the subordination\nprovisions) be payable in respect of the\nsubordinated debt securities by us or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., will instead be\npaid directly to the holders of such senior\nindebtedness of us or The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. (or our or its\nrepresentative or trustee), as the case may\nbe, in accordance with the priorities then\nexisting among such holders until all such\nsenior indebtedness has been paid in full\nbefore any payment or distribution is made\nto the holders of the subordinated debt\nsecurities. In the event that, notwithstanding\nsuch subordination provisions, any payment of\nany kind or character is made on the\nsubordinated debt securities by us or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. before all\nsuch senior indebtedness is paid in full, the\ntrustee or the holders of the subordinated\ndebt securities receiving such payment will be\nrequired to pay over such payment or\ndistribution to the holders of such senior\nindebtedness.\n\nThe subordinated debt indenture will provide\nthat senior indebtedness will not be deemed to\nhave been paid in full unless the holders\nthereof, as\napplicable, shall have received cash (or\nsecurities or other property satisfactory to\nsuch holders) in full payment of such senior\nindebtedness then outstanding. Upon the\npayment in full of all such senior\nindebtedness, the holders of the\nsubordinated debt securities shall be\nsubrogated to all the rights of any holders of\nsuch senior indebtedness to receive any\nfurther payments of us or The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. applicable to such senior\nindebtedness until the subordinated debt\nsecurities shall have been paid in full, and\nsuch payments received by the holders of the\nsubordinated debt securities, by reason of\nsuch subrogation, which otherwise would be\npaid or distributed to the holders of such\nsenior indebtedness, shall, as\nbetween us or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.,\nand its creditors other than the holders of\nsenior indebtedness, on the one hand, and the\nholders of the subordinated debt securities on\nthe other, be deemed to be a payment on\naccount of such senior\nindebtedness, and not on account of the\nsubordinated debt securities or the\nsubordinated guarantee provision in the\nsubordinated debt indenture.\n\nThe subordinated debt indenture will provide\nthat no present or future holder of any senior\nindebtedness of us or The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. will be\nprejudiced in the right to enforce\nsubordination of the indebtedness under the\nsubordinated debt indenture by any act or\nfailure to act on the part of us or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc.\n\nOur Relationship With the Trustee\n\nThe Bank of\nNew York Mellon has provided commercial\nbanking and other services for The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. and its affiliates in the\npast and may do so in the future. Among other\nthings, The Bank of New York Mellon provides\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nwith a line of credit, holds debt securities\nissued by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and\nserves as trustee or agent with regard to\nother debt obligations and warrants of The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. or its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon is initially\nserving as the trustee for the senior debt\nsecurities under the senior debt indentures.\nWe and The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. may also enter into\nsupplemental indentures to the 2008 GSFC\nindenture with The Bank of New York Mellon, as\ntrustee, under which our subordinated debt\nsecurities may be issued. Consequently, if the\nBank of New York Mellon serves\n\n68\n\nas trustee for all those securities and if an\nactual or potential event of default or\ncovenant breach occurs with respect to any of\nthese securities, the trustee may be\nconsidered to have a\nconflicting interest for purposes of the Trust\nIndenture Act of 1939. In that case, the\ntrustee may be required to resign under one or\nmore of the indentures, and we would be\nrequired to appoint a successor trustee. For\nthis purpose, a\n\u0093potential\u0094 event of default or covenant\nbreach means an event that would be an event\nof default or covenant breach if the\nrequirements for giving us default notice or\nfor the default having to exist for a specific\nperiod of time were\ndisregarded. Under the terms of the 2008 GSFC\nindenture, the trustee is deemed not to have a\nconflicting interest with respect to the 2007\nGSFC indenture if an actual or potential event\nof default occurs with respect to senior debt\nsecurities issued\nunder the 2008 GSFC indenture (provided that\nno subordinated debt securities are\noutstanding). Similarly, under the terms of\nthe 2007 GSFC indenture, the trustee is deemed\nnot to have a conflicting interest with\nrespect to the 2008 GSFC indenture if\nan actual or potential event of default occurs\nwith respect to senior debt securities issued\nunder the 2007 GSFC indenture (provided that\nno subordinated debt securities are\noutstanding).\n\nIn addition, affiliates of the trustee have\nunderwritten our securities from time to time\nin the past and may underwrite our securities\nfrom time to\ntime in the future. The trustee may have to\nresign if a default occurs with respect to the\ndebt securities within one year after any\noffering of our securities underwritten by an\naffiliate of the trustee, such as BNY Mellon\nCapital Markets, LLC,\nsince the trustee would likely be considered\nto have a conflicting interest for purposes of\nthe Trust Indenture Act of 1939. In that\nevent, except in very limited circumstances,\nthe trustee would be required to resign as\ntrustee under one or more of\nthe indentures and we would be required to\nappoint a successor trustee, unless the\ndefault is cured or waived within 90 days. In\naddition, the trustee can resign for any\nreason with 60 days\u0092 notice, and we would be\nrequired to appoint a\nsuccessor trustee. If the trustee resigns\nfollowing a default or for any other reason,\nit may be difficult to identify and appoint a\nqualified successor trustee. The trustee will\nremain the trustee under the indenture until a\nsuccessor is appointed.\nDuring the period of time until a successor is\nappointed, the trustee will have both (a)\nduties to noteholders under the indenture and\n(b) a conflicting interest under the indenture\nfor purposes of the Trust Indenture Act.\n\nUnder the senior debt indentures, we are\nrequired to file with the trustee any\ninformation, documents and other reports, or\nsummaries thereof, as may be\nrequired under the Trust Indenture Act, at the\ntimes and in the manner provided under the\nTrust Indenture Act. However, in case of\ndocuments filed with the SEC pursuant to\nSection 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, any\nsuch filing with the\ntrustee need not be made until the 15th day\nafter such filing is actually made with the\nSEC.\n\n69\n\nDESCRIPTION OF WARRANTS WE MAY OFFER Please\nnote that in this section entitled\n\u0093Description of Warrants We May Offer\u0094,\nreferences to \u0093we\u0094, \u0093our\u0094 and \u0093us\u0094 refer only\nto GS Finance Corp. and not to The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc., and references to \u0093The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0094 refer only to The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. and not to its\nconsolidated subsidiaries.

Owners of beneficial interests\nin the warrants should read the section below\nentitled \u0093Legal Ownership and Book-Entry\nIssuance\u0094. The Warrant Indenture We may issue\nwarrants under our 2008 GSFC Indenture, as\nsupplemented by the First Supplemental\nIndenture, dated as of February 20, 2015, the\nFourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of\nAugust 21, 2018, the Seventh Supplemental\nIndenture, dated as of July 1, 2020, and the\nEighth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of\nOctober 14, 2020 (which, collectively, we\nrefer to as the \u0093warrant indenture\u0094). The\nEighth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of\nOctober 14, 2020, expressly addresses the\nissuance of securities designated as warrants.\nWarrants of this kind will not be secured by\nany of our property or assets or property or\nassets of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. or its\nsubsidiaries. Thus, by owning warrants issued\nunder the warrant indenture, you hold our\nunsecured obligations. The warrants issued\nunder the warrant indenture will be our or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s contractual\nobligations and will rank equally with all of\nour or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s other\nunsecured contractual obligations and\nunsecured and unsubordinated debt. The\nindenture will not limit our ability to incur\nadditional contractual obligations or debt.\nThe trustee under the warrant indenture will\nhave two main roles:\n                                              \n      First, the trustee can enforce your     \n      rights against us or The Goldman Sachs  \n      Group, Inc. if we or The Goldman Sachs  \n      Group,                                  \n      Inc. defaults. There are some           \n      limitations on the extent to which the  \n      trustee acts on your behalf, which we   \n      describe below under \u0093\u0097 Default,          \n      Remedies and Waiver of Default\u0094.         \n                                              \n                                              \n      Second, the trustee performs            \n      administrative duties for us, such as   \n      sending you notices.                    \n                                              \nSee \u0093\u0097 Our Relationship With the Trustee\u0094\nbelow for more information about the trustee.\nWe May Issue Many Series of Warrants We may\nissue warrants that are warrants settled in\ncash. We may offer warrants together with our\nother warrants or debt securities or debt or\nequity securities of The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. in the form of units, as summarized below\nin \u0093Description of Units We May Offer\u0094. We\nhave no restrictions on the number of warrants\nor number of distinct series of warrants we\nmay issue. Unless otherwise indicated in your\nprospectus supplement, each series of warrants\nwill be issued under a warrant indenture. This\nsection summarizes terms to be included in the\nwarrant indenture and terms of the warrants\nthat apply generally to the warrants. We will\ndescribe the specific terms of your warrant in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement. Those\nterms may vary from the terms described here.\n70\n\nAs you read this section, please remember that\nthe specific terms of your warrant as\ndescribed in your prospectus supplement will\nsupplement and, if applicable, may modify or\nreplace the general terms described in this\nsection.

Warrants issued in\na unit in the United States may not be so\nseparated before the 91st day after the unit\nis issued. No holder of the warrants will have\nany rights of a holder of the warrant property\nrelating to the warrants. An investment in\nwarrants may involve special risks, including\nrisks associated with indexed securities and\ncurrency-related risks if the warrants or the\nwarrant property is linked to an index or is\npayable in or otherwise linked to a\nnon-U.S.dollar currency. We describe some of\nthese risks below under \u0093Considerations\nRelating to Indexed Securities\u0094 and\n\u0093Considerations Relating to Securities\nDenominated or Payable in or Linked to a\nNon-U.S.Dollar Currency\u0094. Our affiliates may\nresell warrants in market-making transactions\nafter their initial issuance. We discuss these\ntransactions above under \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities We May Offer \u0097 Information in Your\nProspectus Supplement \u0097 Market-Making\nTransactions\u0094. We May Issue Many Series of\nWarrants Under the Warrant Indenture We may\nissue many distinct series of warrants under\nthe warrant indenture. This section summarizes\nterms of the warrants that apply generally to\nall series. The provisions of the warrant\nindenture allow us not only to issue warrants\nwith terms different from those of warrants\npreviously issued under the warrant indenture,\nbut also to \u0093reopen\u0094 a previously issued\nseries of warrants and issue additional\nwarrants of that series. Amounts That We May\nIssue The warrant indenture will not limit the\naggregate number of warrants that we may issue\nor the number of series or the aggregate\namount of any particular series. We may issue\nwarrants and other securities at any time\nwithout your consent and without notifying\nyou. The warrant indenture and the warrants\nwill not limit our ability to incur other\ncontractual obligations or indebtedness or to\nissue other securities. Also, the terms of the\nwarrants do not impose financial or similar\nrestrictions on us except for The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. as described below under \u0093\u0097\nRestriction on Liens\u0094. Expiration Date and\nPayment or Settlement Date The term\n\u0093expiration date\u0094 with respect to any warrant\nmeans the date on which the right to exercise\nthe warrant expires. The term \u0093payment or\nsettlement date\u0094 with respect to any warrant\nmeans the date when any amount in cash with\nrespect to that warrant becomes payable upon\nexercise or redemption of that warrant in\naccordance with its terms. 72\n\nThis Section Is Only a Summary\n\nThe warrant indenture and its associated\ndocuments, including your warrant will contain\nthe full legal text of the matters described\nin this section and\nyour prospectus supplement. We have filed a\ncopy of the warrant indenture with the SEC as\nan exhibit to our registration statement, of\nwhich this prospectus is a part. See\n\u0093Available Information\u0094 above for information\non how to obtain a\ncopy of the warrant indenture.\n\nThis section and your prospectus supplement\nsummarize all the material terms of the\nwarrant indenture and your\nwarrant. They do not, however, describe every\naspect of the warrant indenture and your\nwarrant. For example, in this section and your\nprospectus supplement, we use terms that will\nbe given special meaning in the warrant\nindenture, but we describe\nthe meaning for only the more important of\nthose terms.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe warrants and the warrant indenture will be\ngoverned by New York law.\n\nIn the event that GSFC or The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. becomes subject to a proceeding\nunder a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the\ntransfer of the\nwarrants, the related guarantees and the\nwarrant indenture (together, the \u0093relevant\nagreements\u0094) and any interest and obligation\nin or under the relevant agreements will be\neffective to the same extent as the transfer\nwould be effective\nunder the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if\nthe relevant agreements, and any such interest\nand obligation, were governed by the laws of\nthe United States or a state of the United\nStates. In the event that GSFC or The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. or any\naffiliate of GSFC or The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. becomes subject to a proceeding under a\nU.S. Special Resolution Regime, default rights\nunder the relevant agreements that may be\nexercised against GSFC or The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. are permitted\nto be exercised to no greater extent than such\ndefault rights could be exercised under the\nU.S. Special Resolution Regime if the relevant\nagreements were governed by the laws of the\nUnited States or a state of the United States.\nThe requirements of\nthis paragraph apply notwithstanding the\nfollowing paragraph.\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in\nthe relevant agreements, but subject to\nthe requirements of the preceding paragraph,\nthe parties shall not be permitted to exercise\nany default right against GSFC or The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. with respect to the relevant\nagreements that is related, directly or\nindirectly, to an\naffiliate of GSFC or The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. becoming subject to an insolvency\nproceeding, except to the extent the exercise\nof such default right would be permitted under\nthe creditor protection provisions of 12\nC.F.R. \u00a7 252.84, 12\nC.F.R. \u00a7 47.5, or 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 382.4, as\napplicable. After an affiliate of GSFC or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. has become subject\nto an insolvency proceeding, if any party\nseeks to exercise any default right against\nGSFC or The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. with respect to the relevant\nagreements, that party shall have the burden\nof proof, by clear and convincing evidence,\nthat the exercise of such default right is\npermitted hereunder.\n\nFor purposes of the preceding two paragraphs:\n\n\u0093default right\u0094 has the meaning assigned to\nthat term in, and shall be interpreted in\naccordance with, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 252.81, 47.2 or\n382.1 as applicable;\n\n\u0093insolvency proceeding\u0094 means a receivership,\ninsolvency, liquidation, resolution, or\nsimilar proceeding; and\n\n73\n\n\u0093U.S. Special Resolution Regime\u0094 means each of\n(i) the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the\nregulations promulgated thereunder and (ii)\nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform\nand Consumer Protection Act and the\nregulations promulgated thereunder. Currency\nof Warrants Amounts that become due and\npayable on your warrant may be payable in a\ncurrency, composite currency, basket of\ncurrencies or currency unit or units specified\nin your prospectus supplement. We refer to\nthis currency, composite currency, basket of\ncurrencies or currency unit or units as a\n\u0093specified currency\u0094. The specified currency\nfor your warrant will be U.S. dollars, unless\nyour prospectus supplement states otherwise.\nYou will have to pay for your warrant by\ndelivering the requisite amount of the\nspecified currency to GS&Co. or another firm\nthat we name in your prospectus supplement,\nunless other arrangements have been made\nbetween you and us or you and that firm. We\nwill make payments on your warrants in the\nspecified currency, except as described below\nin \u0093\u0097 Payment Mechanics for Warrants\u0094. See\n\u0093Considerations Relating to Securities\nDenominated or Payable in or Linked to a\nNon-U.S.Dollar Currency\u0094 below for more\ninformation about risks of investing in\nwarrants of this kind. Mergers and Similar\nTransactions We are, and The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. is, generally permitted to merge\nor consolidate with another corporation or\nother entity. We are, and The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. is, also permitted to sell our or\nits assets substantially as an entirety to\nanother corporation or other entity. With\nregard to any series of warrants, however, we\nor The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. may not take\nany of these actions unless all the following\nconditions are met:\n                                              \n      If the successor entity in the          \n      transaction is not GS Finance Corp. or  \n      The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., as the   \n      case may be,                            \n      the successor entity must be organized  \n      as a corporation, partnership or trust  \n      and must expressly assume our or The    \n      Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s obligations  \n      under the warrants of that series and   \n      the warrant indenture. The successor    \n      entity may be                           \n      organized under the laws of any         \n      jurisdiction, whether in the United     \n      States or elsewhere.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      Immediately after the transaction, no   \n      default under the warrants of that      \n      series or the related guarantees has    \n      occurred and                            \n      is continuing. For this purpose,        \n      \u0093default under the warrants of that      \n      series or the related guarantees\u0094 means  \n      an event of default or covenant breach  \n      with respect to that series if the      \n      requirements for giving us or The       \n      Goldman Sachs Group,                    \n      Inc. default (or breach) notice and     \n      for our default (or breach) having to   \n      continue for a specific period of time  \n      were disregarded. We describe these     \n      matters below under \u0093\u0097 Default, Remedies  \n      and Waiver of Default\u0094.                  \n                                              \nIf the conditions described above are\nsatisfied with respect to the warrants of any\nseries, neither we nor The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. will need to obtain the approval\nof the holders of those warrants in order to\nmerge or consolidate or to sell our or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s assets. Also,\nthese conditions will apply only if we or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. wishes to merge or\nconsolidate with another entity or sell our or\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s assets\nsubstantially as an entirety to another\nentity. Neither we nor The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. will need to satisfy these\nconditions if we or The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. enters into other types of transactions,\nincluding any transaction in which we or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. acquire the stock or\nassets of another entity, any transaction that\ninvolves a change of control of us or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. but in which we or\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. does not merge\nor consolidate and any transaction in which we\nor The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. sells less\nthan substantially all our or The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc.\u0092s assets. While we are\ncurrently a wholly owned subsidiary of The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., there is no\nrequirement that we remain a subsidiary. 74\n\nAlso, if we or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nmerges, consolidates or sells our or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s assets\nsubstantially as an entirety and the successor\nis a non-U.S.entity, neither we nor The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. nor any successor\nwould have any obligation to compensate you\nfor any resulting adverse tax consequences\nrelating to your warrants. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing and for the avoidance of doubt, with\nregard to any warrants of any series, we may\nsell or transfer our assets substantially as\nan entirety, in one or more transactions, to\none or more entities, provided that our assets\nand the assets of our direct or indirect\nsubsidiaries in which we own a majority of the\ncombined voting power, taken together, are not\nsold or transferred substantially as an\nentirety to one or more entities that are not\nmajority-owned subsidiaries of The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc., and The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. may sell or transfer its assets\nsubstantially as an entirety in one or more\ntransactions, to one or more entities,\nprovided that the assets of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. and its direct or indirect\nsubsidiaries in which it owns a majority of\nthe combined voting power, taken together, are\nnot sold or transferred substantially as an\nentirety to one or more entities that are not\nsuch subsidiaries. Restriction on Liens In the\nwarrant indenture, The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. promises, with respect to each series of\nwarrants, not to create, assume, incur or\nguarantee any debt for borrowed money that is\nsecured by a lien on the voting or profit\nparticipating equity ownership interests that,\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. or any of its\nsubsidiaries own in GS&Co., or in any\nsubsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nthat beneficially owns or holds, directly or\nindirectly, those interests in GS&Co., unless\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. also secures the\nwarrants of that series on an equal or\npriority basis with the other secured debt.\nThe promise of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.,\nhowever, is subject to an important exception:\nit may secure debt for borrowed money with\nliens on those interests without securing the\nwarrants of any series if its board of\ndirectors determines that the liens do not\nmaterially detract from or interfere with the\nvalue or control of those interests as of the\ndate of the determination. Except as noted\nabove, the warrant indenture does not restrict\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s ability to put\nliens on its interests in its subsidiaries\nother than GS&Co., nor does the warrant\nindenture restrict The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc.\u0092s ability to sell or otherwise dispose of\nits interests in any of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc.\u0092s subsidiaries, including GS&Co.\nIn addition, the restriction on liens in the\nwarrant indenture applies only to liens that\nsecure debt for borrowed money. For example,\nliens imposed by operation of law, such as\nliens to secure statutory obligations for\ntaxes or workers\u0092 compensation benefits, or\nliens The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. creates to\nsecure obligations to pay legal judgments or\nsurety bonds, would not be covered by this\nrestriction. Default, Remedies and Waiver of\nDefault You will have special rights if an\nevent of default or a covenant breach with\nrespect to your series of warrants occurs and\nis continuing, as described in this\nsubsection. For warrants issued under the\nwarrant indenture, and solely for the purposes\nof this section entitled \u0093Default, Remedies\nand Waiver of Default\u0094, the term \u0093series\u0094\nrefers to warrants with the same CUSIP number.\nEvents of Default Unless your prospectus\nsupplement says otherwise, when we refer to an\nevent of default with respect to the warrants\nof any series, we mean any of the following:\n                                              \n      We or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.     \n      does not pay the principal on any       \n      warrant of that series within 30 days   \n      after the due                           \n      date;                                   \n                                              \n75\n                                              \n      We file for bankruptcy or other events  \n      of bankruptcy, insolvency or            \n      reorganization relating to us occur.    \n      Those events must                       \n      arise under U.S. federal or state law,  \n      unless we merge, consolidate or sell    \n      our assets as described above and the   \n      successor firm is a non-U.S. entity.    \n      If that happens, then those events      \n      must arise under U.S.                   \n      federal or state law or the law of the  \n      jurisdiction in which the successor     \n      firm is legally organized; or           \n                                              \n                                              \n      If the applicable prospectus            \n      supplement states that any additional   \n      event of default applies to the         \n      series, that event of                   \n      default occurs.                         \n                                              \nFor warrants issued under the warrant\nindenture, no other defaults under or breaches\nof the warrant indenture or warrants will\nresult in an event of default, whether after\nnotice, the passage of time or otherwise.\nHowever, certain events may give rise to a\ncovenant breach, as described below under \u0093\u0097\nCovenant Breaches\u0094. We may change, eliminate\nor add to the events of default with respect\nto any particular series or any particular\nwarrant or warrants within a series, as\nindicated in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. As described below under \u0093Remedies\nIf an Event of Default or Covenant Breach\nOccurs\u0094, under the warrant indenture, events\nof default will not cause any of GSFC\u0092s\nwarrants issued under such indenture to be\nautomatically accelerated. Under the warrant\nindenture, a breach of a covenant or warranty\nby The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (including,\nfor example, a breach of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc.\u0092s covenants and warranties with\nrespect to mergers and similar transactions or\nrestrictions on liens, described above under\n\u0093Mergers and Similar Transactions\u0094 and\n\u0093Restriction on Liens\u0094, respectively) will not\nhave the potential to cause any of GSFC\u0092s\nwarrants issued under the warrant indenture to\nbe declared due and payable immediately.\nCovenant Breaches Unless your prospectus\nsupplement says otherwise, when we refer to a\ncovenant breach with respect to the warrants\nof any series issued under the warrant\nindenture, we mean the following:\n                                              \n      We remain in breach of any covenant we  \n      make in the warrant indenture for the   \n      benefit of that series, for 60 days     \n      after we                                \n      and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.       \n      receive a notice of covenant breach     \n      stating that we are in breach and       \n      requiring us to remedy the breach. The  \n      notice must be sent by the trustee or   \n      the holders of at least 10% in          \n      principal amount of that series of      \n      securities then outstanding; or         \n                                              \n                                              \n      Except as provided by the warrant       \n      indenture, the security of that series  \n      and the related guarantee, the          \n      guarantee ceases to                     \n      be effective, or a court finds the      \n      guarantee to be unenforceable or        \n      invalid, or The Goldman Sachs Group,    \n      Inc. denies its obligations as the      \n      guarantor.                              \n                                              \nWe may change the definition of covenant\nbreach with respect to any particular series\nor any particular warrant or warrants within a\nseries, as indicated in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. A covenant breach shall\nnot be an event of default with respect to any\nsecurity. Remedies If an Event of Default or\nCovenant Breach Occurs Acceleration of\nwarrants will not be permitted for any reason.\nNeither the trustee nor any holders of such\nwarrants will have any enforcement right or\nother remedy in respect of covenant breaches\n(including breaches of the covenant described\nabove under \u0093\u0097 Mergers and Similar\nTransactions\u0094) except as described below. 76\n\nIf an event of default or covenant breach\noccurs, the trustee will have special duties.\nIn that situation, the trustee will be\nobligated to use those of its rights and\npowers under the warrant indenture, and to use\nthe same degree of care and skill in doing so,\nthat a prudent person would use in that\nsituation in conducting his or her own\naffairs. Except as described in the prior\nparagraph, the trustee is not required to take\nany action under the warrant indenture at the\nrequest of any holders unless the holders\noffer the trustee reasonable protection from\nexpenses and liability. This is called an\nindemnity. If the trustee is provided with an\nindemnity reasonably satisfactory to it, the\nholders of a majority in principal amount of\nall securities of the relevant series may\ndirect the time, method and place of\nconducting any lawsuit or other formal legal\naction seeking any remedy available to the\ntrustee with respect to that series. These\nmajority holders may also direct the trustee\nin performing any other action under the\nwarrant indenture with respect to the\nsecurities of that series. Before you bypass\nthe trustee and bring your own lawsuit or\nother formal legal action or take other steps\nto enforce your rights or protect your\ninterests relating to any warrant, all of the\nfollowing must occur:\n                                              \n      The holder of your warrant must give    \n      the trustee written notice that an      \n      event of default or covenant breach     \n      has occurred,                           \n      and the event of default (or covenant   \n      breach) must not have been cured or     \n      waived;                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      The holders of not less than 25% in     \n      principal amount of all warrants of     \n      your series must make a written         \n      request that the                        \n      trustee take action because of the      \n      default (or breach), and they or other  \n      holders must offer to the trustee       \n      indemnity reasonably satisfactory to    \n      the trustee against the cost and other  \n      liabilities of taking that action;      \n                                              \n                                              \n      The trustee must not have taken action  \n      for 60 days after the above steps have  \n      been taken; and                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      During those 60 days, the holders of a  \n      majority in principal amount of the     \n      warrants of your series must not have   \n      given the                               \n      trustee directions that are             \n      inconsistent with the written request   \n      of the holders of not less than 25% in  \n      principal amount of the warrants of     \n      your series.                            \n                                              \nYou are entitled at any time, however, to\nbring a lawsuit for the payment of money due\non your security on or after its payment date\n(or, if your security is redeemable, on or\nafter its redemption date). Waiver of Default\nThe holders of not less than a majority in\nprincipal amount of the warrants of any series\nmay waive a default for all securities of that\nseries. If this happens, the default will be\ntreated as if it has not occurred. No one can\nwaive a payment default on your security,\nhowever, without the approval of the\nparticular holder of that security. For the\npurpose of this paragraph, the term \u0093default\u0094\nmeans any event which is, or after notice or\nlapse of time or both would become, an event\nof default or covenant breach in respect of\nthe relevant securities. We and The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. Will Give the Trustee\nInformation About Defaults Annually We and The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. will furnish to the\ntrustee every year a written statement,\nrespectively, of two of our or its officers\ncertifying that to their knowledge we or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., as the case may be,\nis in compliance with the warrant indenture\nand the securities issued under it, or else\nspecifying any default under the warrant\nindenture. For the purpose of this paragraph,\nthe term \u0093default\u0094 means any event which is,\nor after notice or lapse of time or both would\nbecome, an event of default or covenant breach\nin respect of the relevant securities. 77\n\nBook-entry and other indirect owners should\nconsult their banks or brokers for information\non how to give notice or direction to or make\na request of the trustee. Book-entry and other\nindirect owners are described below under\n\u0093Legal Ownership and Book-Entry Issuance\u0094.\nModification of the Warrant Indenture and\nWaiver of Covenants There are three types of\nchanges we and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\ncan make to the warrant indenture and the\nsecurities or series of securities and related\nguarantees issued under such indenture.\nChanges Requiring Each Holder\u0092s Approval\nFirst, there are changes that cannot be made\nwithout the approval of the holder of each\nsecurity affected by the change under the\nwarrant indenture. Here is a list of those\ntypes of changes:\n                                              \n      change the exercise price of the        \n      security;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      change the payment date for any         \n      principal payment of the security;      \n                                              \n                                              \n      reduce the principal amount or the      \n      redemption price for a warrant;         \n                                              \n                                              \n      permit redemption of a security if not  \n      previously permitted;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n      impair any right a holder may have to   \n      require repayment of its security;      \n                                              \n                                              \n      change the currency of any payment on   \n      a security;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      change the place of payment on a        \n      security;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      impair a holder\u0092s right to sue for       \n      payment of any amount due on its        \n      security;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      reduce the percentage in principal      \n      amount of the securities of any one or  \n      more affected series, taken separately  \n      or                                      \n      together, as applicable, and whether    \n      comprising the same or different        \n      series or less than all of the          \n      securities of a series, the approval    \n      of whose holders is needed to change    \n      the warrant indenture or those          \n      securities;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      reduce the percentage in principal      \n      amount of the securities of any one or  \n      more affected series, taken separately  \n      or                                      \n      together, as applicable, and whether    \n      comprising the same or different        \n      series or less than all of the          \n      securities of a series, the consent of  \n      whose holders is needed to waive our    \n      compliance with the applicable debt     \n      indenture or to waive defaults; and     \n                                              \n                                              \n      change the provisions of the            \n      applicable debt indenture dealing with  \n      modification and waiver in any other    \n      respect, except to                      \n      increase any required percentage        \n      referred to above or to add to the      \n      provisions that cannot be changed or    \n      waived without approval of the holder   \n      of each affected security.              \n                                              \nChanges Not Requiring Approval The second type\nof change does not require any approval by\nholders of the securities affected. These\nchanges are limited to clarifications and\nchanges that would not adversely affect any\nsecurities of any series in any material\nrespect. Neither we nor The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. needs any approval to make changes\nthat affect only securities to be issued under\nthe warrant indenture after the changes take\neffect. We and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nmay also make changes or obtain waivers that\ndo not adversely affect a particular security,\neven if they affect other securities. In those\ncases, neither we nor The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. needs to obtain the approval of the\nholder of the unaffected security; we and The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. need only obtain any\nrequired approvals from the holders of the\naffected securities. 78\n\nChanges Requiring Majority Approval Any other\nchange to the warrant indenture and the\nsecurities issued under such debt indenture\nwould require the following approval:\n                                              \n      If the change affects only particular   \n      securities within a series, it must be  \n      approved by the holders of a majority   \n      in                                      \n      principal amount of such particular     \n      securities.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      If the change affects multiple          \n      securities of one or more series, it    \n      must be approved by the holders of a    \n      majority in                             \n      principal amount of all securities      \n      affected by the change, with all such   \n      affected securities voting together as  \n      one class for this purpose (and by the  \n      holders of a majority in principal      \n      amount of any affected securities that  \n      by their terms are                      \n      entitled to vote separately as          \n      described below).                       \n                                              \nIn each case, the required approval must be\ngiven by written consent. This would mean that\nmodification of terms with respect to certain\nsecurities of a series could be effectuated\nunder the warrant indenture without obtaining\nthe consent of the holders of a majority in\nprincipal amount of other securities of such\nseries that are not affected by such\nmodification. The same majority approval would\nbe required for us to obtain a waiver of any\nof our covenants in the warrant indenture. Our\ncovenants include the promises we and The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. make about merging\nand, with respect to The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc., putting liens on our interests in\nGS&Co., which we describe above under \u0093\u0097\nMergers and Similar Transactions\u0094 and \u0093\u0097\nRestriction on Liens\u0094, and which, in the\nlatter case, are only for the benefit of the\nholders of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s\nsenior securities. If the holders approve a\nwaiver of a covenant, neither we nor The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. will have to comply\nwith it. The holders, however, cannot approve\na waiver of any provision in a particular\nsecurity, or in the warrant indenture as it\naffects that security, that neither we nor The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. can change without\nthe approval of the holder of that security as\ndescribed above in \u0093\u0097 Changes Requiring Each\nHolder\u0092s Approval\u0094, unless that holder\napproves the waiver. Book-entry and other\nindirect owners should consult their banks or\nbrokers for information on how approval may be\ngranted or denied if we and The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. seek to change the warrant\nindenture or any warrants or request a waiver.\nSpecial Rules for Action by Holders When\nholders take any action under the warrant\nindenture, such as giving a notice of default,\napproving any change or waiver or giving the\ntrustee an instruction, we will apply the\nfollowing rules. Only Outstanding Warrants Are\nEligible Only holders of outstanding warrants\nof the applicable series will be eligible to\nparticipate in any action by holders of\nwarrants of that series. Also, we will count\nonly outstanding warrants in determining\nwhether the various percentage requirements\nfor taking action have been met. For these\npurposes, the warrants will not be\n\u0093outstanding\u0094 if:\n                                              \n      they have been surrendered for          \n      cancellation;                           \n                                              \n                                             \n      they have been called for redemption;  \n                                             \n                                              \n      we have deposited or set aside, in      \n      trust for its holder, an amount in      \n      cash for their payment or settlement;   \n      or                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      we or one of our affiliates, such as    \n      GS&Co., is the owner.                   \n                                              \n79\n\nSpecial Class Voting Rights\n\nWith respect to the warrant indenture, we may\nissue particular securities or a particular\nseries of securities, as applicable, that are\nentitled, by\ntheir terms, to vote separately on matters\n(for example, modification or waiver of\nprovisions in the warrant indenture) that\nwould otherwise require a vote of all affected\nsecurities or all affected series voting\ntogether as a single class. Any such\nsecurities or series of securities would be\nentitled to vote together with all other\naffected securities or affected series voting\ntogether as one class, and would also be\nentitled to vote separately as one class only.\nIn some cases, other parties\nmay be entitled to exercise these special\nvoting rights on behalf of the holders of the\nrelevant securities or the relevant series.\nFor securities or series of securities that\nhave these rights, the rights will be\ndescribed in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. For securities or\nseries of securities that do not have these\nspecial rights, voting will occur as described\nin the preceding sections, but subject to any\nseparate voting rights of any other securities\nor series of securities\nhaving special rights. We may issue series\nhaving these or other special voting rights\nwithout obtaining the consent of or giving\nnotice to holders of outstanding securities or\nseries.\n\nDetermining Record Dates for Action by Holders\n\nWe or\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. will generally\nbe entitled to set any day as a record date\nfor the purpose of determining the holders\nthat are entitled to take action under the\nwarrant indenture. In certain limited\ncircumstances, only the trustee will\nbe entitled to set a record date for action by\nholders. If we, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nor the trustee set a record date for an\napproval or other action to be taken by\nholders, that vote or action may be taken only\nby persons or entities who\nare holders on the record date and must be\ntaken during the period that we specify for\nthis purpose, or that the trustee specifies if\nit sets the record date. We, The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. or the trustee, as applicable, may\nshorten or lengthen\nthis period from time to time. This period,\nhowever, may not extend beyond the 180th day\nafter the record date for the action. In\naddition, record dates for any global warrant\nmay be set in accordance with procedures\nestablished by the depositary\nfrom time to time. Accordingly, record dates\nfor global warrants may differ from those for\nother warrants.\n\nRedemption\n\nWe will not be entitled to redeem your warrant\nbefore its expiration date unless your\nprospectus supplement specifies a redemption\ncommencement date.\n\nIf your prospectus supplement specifies a\nredemption commencement date, it will also\nspecify one or more redemption prices. It may\nalso specify one\nor more redemption periods during which the\nredemption prices relating to a redemption of\nwarrants during those periods will apply.\n\nIf your\nprospectus supplement specifies a redemption\ncommencement date, your warrants will be\nredeemable at our option at any time on or\nafter that date or at a specified time or\ntimes. If we redeem your warrants, we will do\nso at the specified redemption\nprice. If different prices are specified for\ndifferent redemption periods, the price we or\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. pay will be the\nprice that applies to the redemption period\nduring which your warrant is redeemed.\n\nIf we exercise an option to redeem any\nwarrant, we will give to the holder written\nnotice of the redemption price of the warrant\nto be redeemed, not\nless than 30 days nor more than 60 days before\nthe applicable redemption date or within any\nother period before the applicable redemption\ndate specified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. We will give the notice in the\nmanner described below\nin \u0093\u0097 Notices\u0094.\n\nWe, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. or our or\nits affiliates may purchase warrants from\ninvestors who are willing to\nsell from time to time, either in the open\nmarket at prevailing prices or in private\n\n80\n\ntransactions at negotiated prices. Warrants\nthat we or they purchase may, at our\ndiscretion, be held, resold or canceled.\nEligible Principal Amount of Some Securities\nIn some situations, we may follow special\nrules in calculating the principal amount of\nwarrants that are to be treated as outstanding\nfor the purposes described above. This may\nhappen, for example, if the principal amount\nis payable in a non-U.S.dollar currency,\nincreases over time or is not to be fixed\nuntil the payment date. For any warrant of the\nkind described below, we will decide how much\nprincipal amount to attribute to the warrant\nas follows:\n                                              \n      For a warrant whose principal amount    \n      is not known, we will use the premium   \n      amount for that warrant unless we       \n      indicate                                \n      otherwise in the applicable prospectus  \n      supplement. The principal amount of a   \n      warrant may not be known, for example,  \n      because it is based on an index that    \n      changes from time to time and the       \n      principal amount is not to be           \n      determined until a later date;          \n      or                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      For warrants with a principal amount    \n      denominated in one or more non-U.S.     \n      dollar                                  \n      currencies or currency units, we will   \n      use the U.S. dollar equivalent, which   \n      we will determine.                      \n                                              \nForm, Exchange and Transfer of Warrants Each\nwarrant will be issued in global \u0097 i.e., book-\nentry \u0097 form only, unless we say otherwise in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement. Warrants\nin book-entry form will be represented by a\nglobal security registered in the name of a\ndepositary, which will be the holder of all\nthe warrants represented by the global\nsecurity. Those who own beneficial interests\nin a global warrant will do so through\nparticipants in the depositary\u0092s clearing\nsystem, and the rights of these indirect\nowners will be governed solely by the\napplicable procedures of the depositary and\nits participants. We describe book-entry\nsecurities below under \u0093Legal Ownership and\nBook-Entry Issuance\u0094. If the warrants are\nissued as a registered global warrant, only\nthe depositary \u0097 e.g., DTC, Euroclear and\nClearstream \u0097 will be entitled to transfer and\nexchange the warrants as described in this\nsubsection, since the depositary will be the\nsole holder of the warrant. If any warrants\ncease to be issued in registered global form,\nthey will be issued:\n                                          \n      only in fully registered form; and  \n                                          \n                                              \n      only in the denominations specified in  \n      your prospectus supplement.             \n                                              \nHolders may exchange their warrants for\nwarrants of smaller denominations or combined\ninto fewer warrants of larger denominations,\nas long as the total number of warrants is not\nchanged. Holders may exchange or transfer\ntheir warrants at the office of the trustee.\nThey may also replace lost, stolen, destroyed\nor mutilated warrants at that office. We may\nappoint the trustee to act as our agent for\nregistering warrants in the names of holders\nand transferring and replacing warrants. We\nmay, without your approval, appoint another\nentity to perform these functions or perform\nthem ourselves. Holders will not be required\nto pay a service charge to transfer or\nexchange their warrants, but they may be\nrequired to pay for any tax or other\ngovernmental charge associated with the\ntransfer or exchange. The transfer or\nexchange, and any replacement, will be made\nonly if our transfer agent is satisfied with\nthe holder\u0092s proof of legal ownership. The\ntransfer agent may require an indemnity before\nreplacing any warrants. 81\n\nIf we have the right to redeem, accelerate or\nsettle any warrants before their expiration,\nand we exercise our right as to less than all\nthose warrants, we may block the transfer or\nexchange of those warrants during the period\nbeginning 15 days before the day we mail the\nnotice of exercise and ending on the day of\nthat mailing or during any other period\nspecified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, in order to freeze the list of\nholders to prepare the mailing. We may also\nrefuse to register transfers of or exchange\nany warrants selected for early settlement,\nexcept that we will continue to permit\ntransfers and exchanges of the unsettled\nportion of any warrants being partially\nsettled. If we have designated additional\ntransfer agents for your warrant, they will be\nnamed in your prospectus supplement. We may,\nwithout your approval, appoint additional\ntransfer agents or cancel the appointment of\nany particular transfer agent. We may also\napprove a change in the office through which\nany transfer agent acts. The rules for\nexchange described above apply to exchange of\nwarrants for other warrants of the same series\nand kind. Payment Mechanics for Warrants Who\nReceives Payment? If money is due on the\nwarrants at their payment or settlement date,\nwe or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. will pay\nthe amount to the holder of the warrant\nagainst surrender of the warrant at a proper\nplace of payment or, in the case of a global\nwarrant, in accordance with the applicable\npolicies of the depositary, DTC, Euroclear or\nClearstream, as applicable. How We or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. Will Make Payments\nDue in U.S. Dollars We or The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. will follow the practice described\nin this subsection when paying amounts due in\nU.S. dollars. Payments of amounts due in other\ncurrencies will be made as described in the\nnext subsection.\n                                              \n      Payments on Global Warrants. We or The  \n      Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. will make     \n      payments on a global warrant in         \n      accordance with the applicable          \n      policies of the depositary as in        \n      effect from time to time. Under those   \n      policies, we or The Goldman Sachs       \n      Group, Inc. will pay directly to the    \n      depositary, or its nominee, and not to  \n      any indirect owners who own             \n      beneficial interests in the global      \n      warrant. An indirect owner\u0092s right to    \n      receive those payments will be          \n      governed by the rules and practices of  \n      the depositary and its participants,    \n      as described below in the section       \n      entitled \u0093Legal Ownership                \n      and Book-Entry Issuance \u0097 What Is a      \n      Global Security?\u0094                        \n                                              \n                                              \n      Payments on Non-Global Warrants. We or  \n      The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.           \n      will make payments on the warrants in   \n      non-global, registered form as          \n      follows. We or The Goldman Sachs        \n      Group, Inc. will make all payments by   \n      check at the paying agent described     \n      below, against surrender of the         \n      warrants. All payments by check will    \n      be made in next-day funds \u0097 i.e., funds  \n      that become available on the day after  \n      the check is cashed.                    \n                                              \nAlternatively, if a non-globalwarrant has an\noriginal issue price of at least $1,000,000\nand the holder asks us to do so, we or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. will pay any amount\nthat becomes due on the warrants by wire\ntransfer of immediately available funds to an\naccount at a bank in New York City, on the\npayment or settlement date. To request wire\npayment, the holder must give the paying agent\nappropriate wire transfer instructions at\nleast five business days before the requested\nwire payment is due. Payment will be made only\nafter the warrant is surrendered to the paying\nagent. 82\n\nBook-entry and other indirect owners should\nconsult their banks or brokers for information\non how they will receive payments on their\nwarrants.\n\nHow We or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Will\nMake Payments Due in Other Currencies\n\nWe or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. will\nfollow the practice described in this\nsubsection when paying amounts that are due in\na specified currency other\nthan U.S. dollars.\n\nPayments on Global Warrants.We or The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. will make payments on a\nglobal warrant in the\napplicable specified currency in accordance\nwith the applicable policies as in effect from\ntime to time of the depositary, which may be\nDTC, Euroclear or Clearstream. Unless we\nspecify otherwise in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, The\nDepository Trust Company, New York, New York,\nknown as DTC, will be the depositary for all\nwarrants in global form.\n\nIndirect owners of a global warrant\ndenominated in a currency other than U.S.\ndollars should consult their banks or brokers\nfor information on how to request payment in\nthe specified currency in cases where holders\nhave a right to do so.\n\nPayments on Non-GlobalWarrants.Except as\ndescribed in the last paragraph under this\nheading, we or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nwill make payments on warrants in\nnon-global form in the applicable specified\ncurrency. We or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nwill make these payments by wire transfer of\nimmediately available funds to any account\nthat is maintained in the\napplicable specified currency at a bank\ndesignated by the holder and acceptable to us\nor The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and the\ntrustee. To designate an account for wire\npayment, the holder must give the paying agent\nappropriate wire instructions at\nleast five business days before the requested\nwire payment is due. The payment will be made\nonly after the warrants are surrendered to the\npaying agent.\n\nIf a holder fails to give instructions as\ndescribed above, we or The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. will notify the holder at the\naddress in the\ntrustee\u0092s records and will make the payment\nwithin five business days after the holder\nprovides appropriate instructions. Any late\npayment made in these circumstances will be\ntreated under the warrant indenture as if made\non the payment or\nsettlement date, and no interest will accrue\non the late payment from the payment or\nsettlement date to the date paid.\n\nAlthough a payment on\nwarrants in non-global form may be due in a\nspecified currency other than U.S. dollars, we\nor The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. will make the\npayment in U.S. dollars if your prospectus\nsupplement specifies that\nholders may ask us to do so and you make such\na request. To request U.S. dollar payment in\nthese circumstances, the holder must provide\nappropriate written notice to the trustee at\nleast five business days before the payment or\nsettlement date for\nwhich payment in U.S. dollars is requested.\n\nBook-entry and other indirect owners of a\nwarrant with a specified currency other than\nU.S. dollars should contact their banks or\nbrokers for information about how to receive\npayments in the specified currency or in U.S.\ndollars.\n\nConversion to U.S. Dollars.Unless otherwise\nindicated in your prospectus supplement,\nholders are not entitled to receive payments\nin U.S. dollars of an amount due in another\ncurrency, either on a global warrant or a\nnon-global warrant.\n\nIf your prospectus supplement specifies that\nholders may request that we make payments\nin U.S. dollars of an amount due in another\ncurrency, the exchange rate agent described\nbelow will calculate\n\n83\n\nthe U.S. dollar amount the holder receives in\nthe exchange rate agent\u0092s discretion. A holder\nthat requests payment in U.S. dollars will\nbear all associated currency exchange costs,\nwhich will be deducted from the payment. When\nthe Specified Currency Is Not Available.If we\nor The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is obligated\nto make any payment in a specified currency\nother than U.S. dollars, and the specified\ncurrency or any successor currency is not\navailable to us or The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. due to circumstances beyond our or its\ncontrol \u0097 such as the imposition of exchange\ncontrols or a disruption in the currency\nmarkets \u0097 we or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nwill be entitled to satisfy our obligation to\nmake the payment in that specified currency by\nmaking the payment in U.S. dollars, on the\nbasis of the exchange rate determined by the\nexchange rate agent described below, in its\ndiscretion. The foregoing will apply to any\nwarrant, whether in global or non-globalform,\nand to any payment, including a payment at the\npayment or settlement date. Any payment made\nunder the circumstances and in a manner\ndescribed above will not result in a default\nunder any warrant or the warrant indenture.\nExchange Rate Agent.If we issue a warrant in a\nspecified currency other than U.S. dollars, we\nwill appoint a financial institution to act as\nthe exchange rate agent and will name the\ninstitution initially appointed when the\nwarrant is originally issued in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. We may select GS&Co. or\nanother of our affiliates to perform this\nrole. We may change the exchange rate agent\nfrom time to time after the original issue\ndate of the warrant without your consent and\nwithout notifying you of the change. All\ndeterminations made by the exchange rate agent\nwill be in its sole discretion unless we state\nin the applicable prospectus supplement that\nany determination requires our approval. In\nthe absence of manifest error, those\ndeterminations will be conclusive for all\npurposes and binding on you and us, without\nany liability on the part of the exchange rate\nagent. Payment When Offices Are Closed Unless\notherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, if any payment is due\non a warrant on a day that is not a business\nday, we or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. will\nmake the payment on the next day that is a\nbusiness day. Payments postponed to the next\nbusiness day in this situation will be treated\nunder the warrant indenture as if they were\nmade on the original payment or settlement\ndate. Postponement of this kind will not\nresult in a default under any warrant or the\nwarrant indenture, and, unless otherwise\nspecified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, no interest will accrue on the\npostponed amount from the original payment or\nsettlement date to the next day that is a\nbusiness day. The term \u0093business day\u0094 means,\nfor any warrant, a day that meets all the\nfollowing applicable requirements:\n                                              \n      for all warrants, is a Monday,          \n      Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday  \n      that is not a day on which banking      \n      institutions in                         \n      New York City are authorized or         \n      obligated by law or executive order to  \n      close and that satisfies any other      \n      criteria specified in your prospectus   \n      supplement; and                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      if the warrant has a specified          \n      currency other than U.S. dollars or     \n      euros, is also a day on which banking   \n      institutions are                        \n      not authorized or obligated by law,     \n      regulation or executive order to close  \n      in the principal financial center of    \n      the country issuing the specified       \n      currency.                               \n                                              \n84\n\nPaying Agent\n\nWe may appoint one or more financial\ninstitutions to act as our or The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc.\u0092s paying agents, at whose\ndesignated offices\nwarrants in non-global entry form may be\nsurrendered for payment at their payment or\nsettlement date. We call each of those offices\na paying agent. We may add, replace or\nterminate paying agents from time to\ntime. We may also choose to act as our own\npaying agent. We must notify the trustee of\nchanges in the paying agents.\n\nUnclaimed Payments\n\nRegardless of who acts as paying agent, all\namounts in cash paid by us to a paying agent\nthat remain unclaimed at the end of two years\nafter the amount\nis due to a holder will be repaid or\nredelivered to us or The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. After that two-year period, the holder\nmay look only to us or The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. for payment of any amount in\ncash, and not to the trustee, any other paying\nagent or anyone else.\n\nNotices\n\nNotices to be given to holders of a global\nwarrant will be given only to the depositary,\nin accordance with its applicable policies as\nin effect from\ntime to time. Notices to be given to holders\nof warrants not in global form will be sent by\nmail to the respective addresses of the\nholders as they appear in the trustee\u0092s\nrecords, and will be deemed given when mailed.\nNeither the failure to\ngive any notice to a particular holder, nor\nany defect in a notice given to a particular\nholder, will affect the sufficiency of any\nnotice given to another holder.\n\nBook-entry and other indirect owners should\nconsult their banks or brokers for information\non how they will receive notices.\n\nGuarantee by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. will fully and\nunconditionally guarantee the payment on the\nwarrants, when due and payable, upon the\nexercise of your\nwarrants, call for redemption or otherwise, in\naccordance with the terms of the warrant, the\nwarrant indenture and the applicable\nprospectus supplement accompanying this\nprospectus. The guarantee will remain in\neffect until the entire payment, if\nany, on the warrant has been paid in full or\ndischarged in accordance with the provisions\nof the warrant indenture.\n\nBecause The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. is a holding company, its ability\nto perform its obligations on the guarantees\nendorsed on the warrants will depend in part\non its ability to participate in distributions\nof assets from its subsidiaries. We discuss\nthese matters above\nunder \u0093Prospectus Summary \u0097 The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. is a Holding Company\u0094.\n\nOur Relationship With the Trustee\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon has provided\ncommercial banking and other services for The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its affiliates\nin the past and may\ndo so in the future. Among other things, The\nBank of New York Mellon provides The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. with a line of credit, holds\ndebt securities issued by The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. and serves as trustee or agent\nwith regard to other\nwarrants and debt obligations of The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. or its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon is initially\nserving as the trustee\nfor the senior debt securities under the\nsenior debt indentures and the warrants under\nthe warrant indenture. We and The Goldman\nSachs\n\n85\n\nGroup, Inc. may enter into supplemental\nindentures to the 2008 GSFC indenture with The\nBank of New York Mellon, as trustee, under\nwhich our subordinated debt securities may be\nissued.\nConsequently, if The Bank of New York Mellon\nserves as trustee for all of those securities\nand if an actual or potential event of default\noccurs with respect to any of these\nsecurities, the trustee may be considered to\nhave a conflicting interest\nfor purposes of the Trust Indenture Act of\n1939. In that case, the trustee may be\nrequired to resign under one or more of the\nindentures, including the warrant indenture,\nand we would be required to appoint a\nsuccessor trustee. For this purpose, a\n\u0093potential\u0094 event of default means an event\nthat would be an event of default if the\nrequirements for giving us default notice or\nfor the default having to exist for a specific\nperiod of time were disregarded. Under the\nterms of the 2008\nGSFC indenture, the trustee is deemed not to\nhave a conflicting interest with respect to\nthe 2007 GSFC indenture if an actual or\npotential event of default occurs with respect\nto the senior debt securities or warrants\nissued under the 2008 GSFC\nindenture (provided that no subordinated debt\nsecurities are outstanding). Similarly, under\nthe terms of the 2007 GSFC indenture, the\ntrustee is deemed not to have a conflicting\ninterest with respect to the 2008 GSFC\nindenture if an actual or\npotential event of default occurs with respect\nto senior debt securities issued under the\n2007 GSFC indenture (provided that no\nsubordinated debt securities are outstanding).\n\nIn addition, affiliates of the trustee may\nunderwrite our warrants from time to time in\nthe future. The trustee may have to resign if\na default occurs\nwith respect to the warrants within one year\nafter any offering of our warrants\nunderwritten by an affiliate of the trustee,\nsuch as BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, since\nthe trustee would likely be considered to have\na conflicting interest for\npurposes of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.\nIn that event, except in very limited\ncircumstances, the trustee would be required\nto resign as trustee under one or more of the\nindentures and we would be required to appoint\na successor trustee, unless\nthe default is cured or waived within 90 days.\nIn addition, the trustee can resign for any\nreason with 60 days\u0092 notice, and we would be\nrequired to appoint a successor trustee. If\nthe trustee resigns following a default or for\nany other reason,\nit may be difficult to identify and appoint a\nqualified successor trustee. The trustee will\nremain the trustee under the indenture until a\nsuccessor is appointed. During the period of\ntime until a successor is appointed, the\ntrustee will have both\n(a) duties to noteholders under the indenture\nand (b) a conflicting interest under the\nindenture for purposes of the Trust Indenture\nAct.\n\nUnder the warrant indenture, we will be\nrequired to file with the trustee any\ninformation, documents and other reports, or\nsummaries thereof, as may be\nrequired under the Trust Indenture Act, at the\ntimes and in the manner provided under the\nTrust Indenture Act. However, in case of\ndocuments filed with the SEC pursuant to\nSection 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, any\nsuch filing with the\ntrustee will not need to be made until the\n15th day after such filing is actually made\nwith the SEC.\n\nCalculation Agent\n\nCalculations relating to warrants will be made\nby the calculation agent, an institution that\nwe appoint as our agent for this purpose. That\ninstitution\nmay include any affiliate of ours, such as\nGS&Co. The prospectus supplement for a\nparticular warrant will name the institution\nthat we have appointed to act as the\ncalculation agent for that warrant as of its\noriginal issue date. We may appoint\na different institution to serve as\ncalculation agent from time to time after the\noriginal issue date of the warrant without\nyour consent and without notifying you of the\nchange.\n\nThe calculation agent\u0092s determination of any\namount in cash payable with respect to the\nwarrants will be final and binding in the\nabsence of\nmanifest error.\n\n86\n\nAll percentages resulting from any calculation\nrelating to the warrants will be rounded\nupward or\ndownward, as appropriate, to the next higher\nor lower one hundred-thousandth of a\npercentage point, e.g., 9.876541% (or\n.09876541) being rounded down to 9.87654% (or\n.0987654) and 9.876545% (or .09876545) being\nrounded up to 9.87655% (or\n..0987655). All amounts used in or resulting\nfrom any calculation relating to the warrants\nwill be rounded upward or downward, as\nappropriate, to the nearest cent, in the case\nof U.S. dollars, or to the nearest\ncorresponding hundredth of a unit, in\nthe case of a currency other than U.S.\ndollars, with one-half cent or one-half of a\ncorresponding hundredth of a unit or more\nbeing rounded upward.\n\n87\n\nDESCRIPTION OF UNITS WE MAY OFFER Please note\nthat in this section entitled \u0093Description of\nUnits We May Offer\u0094, references to \u0093we\u0094, \u0093our\u0094\nand \u0093us\u0094 refer only to GS Finance Corp. and\nnot to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and\nreferences to \u0093The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0094\nrefer only to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nand not to its consolidated subsidiaries.\nAlso, in this section, references to \u0093holders\u0094\nmean those who own units registered in their\nown names, on the books that we or our agent\nmaintain for this purpose, and not those who\nown beneficial interests in units registered\nin street name or in units issued in book-\nentry form through one or more depositaries.\nOwners of beneficial interests in the units\nshould read the section below entitled \u0093Legal\nOwnership and Book-Entry Issuance\u0094. We may\nissue units comprised of one or more debt\nsecurities or warrants described in this\nprospectus or of the foregoing and debt or\nequity securities of The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. Each unit will be issued so that the\nholder of the unit is also the holder of each\nsecurity included in the unit. Thus, the\nholder of a unit will have the rights and\nobligations of a holder of each included\nsecurity. The unit agreement under which a\nunit is issued may provide that the securities\nincluded in the unit may not be held or\ntransferred separately, at any time or at any\ntime before a specified date. The applicable\nprospectus supplement may describe:\n                                              \n      the designation and terms of the units  \n      and of the securities comprising the    \n      units, including whether and under      \n      what                                    \n      circumstances those securities may be   \n      held or transferred separately;         \n                                              \n                                              \n      any provisions of the governing unit    \n      agreement that differ from those        \n      described below; and                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      any provisions for the issuance,        \n      payment, settlement, transfer or        \n      exchange of the units or of the         \n      securities comprising the               \n      units.                                  \n                                              \nThe provisions described in this section, as\nwell as those described under \u0093Description of\nDebt Securities We May Offer\u0094 and \u0093Description\nof Warrants We May Offer\u0094 will apply to the\nsecurities included in each unit, to the\nextent relevant. If a unit includes securities\nof The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., such\nsecurities of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nwill be described in a separate prospectus. An\ninvestment in units may involve special risks,\nincluding risks associated with indexed\nsecurities and currency-related risks if the\nsecurities comprising the units are linked to\nan index or are payable in or otherwise linked\nto a non-U.S.dollar currency. We describe some\nof these risks below under \u0093Considerations\nRelating to Indexed Securities\u0094 and\n\u0093Considerations Relating to Securities\nDenominated or Payable in or Linked to a\nNon-U.S.Dollar Currency\u0094. Our affiliates may\nresell units after their initial issuance in\nmarket-making transactions. We discuss these\ntransactions above under \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities We May Offer \u0097 Information in Your\nProspectus Supplement \u0097 Market-Making\nTransactions\u0094. We May Issue Many Series of\nUnits We may issue units in such amounts and\nin as many distinct series as we wish. We may\nalso \u0093reopen\u0094 a previously issued series of\nunits and issue additional units of that\nseries. This section summarizes terms of the\nunits that apply generally to all series. We\ndescribe other specific terms of your series\nin the applicable prospectus supplement\naccompanying this prospectus. Those terms may\nvary from the terms described here. 88\n\nAs you read this section, please remember that\nthe specific terms of your units as described\nin your prospectus supplement will supplement\nand, if applicable, may modify or replace the\ngeneral terms described in this section. If\nthere are differences between your prospectus\nsupplement and this prospectus, your\nprospectus supplement will control. Thus, the\nstatements we make in this section may not\napply to your units.\n\nWhen we refer to a series of units, we mean\nall units issued as part of\nthe same series under the applicable unit\nagreement. We will identify the series of\nwhich your units are a part in your prospectus\nsupplement. When we refer to your prospectus\nsupplement, we mean the prospectus supplement\ndescribing the specific\nterms of the units you purchase.\n\nUnit Agreements\n\nThe units will be issued under one or more\nunit agreements to be entered into among us,\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., as guarantor,\nand a bank or other\nfinancial institution, as unit agent. We may\nadd, replace or terminate unit agents from\ntime to time. We may also choose to act as our\nown unit agent, and we may select GS&Co. or\nanother of our affiliates to perform this\nrole. We will identify\nthe unit agreement under which your units will\nbe issued and the unit agent under that\nagreement in your prospectus supplement. In\nsome cases, we may issue units under one of\nour indentures. Securities included in a unit\nwill be governed by their\nrespective governing documents.\n\nWe will file the unit agreement, when\nexecuted, under which we issue your units with\nthe SEC as an exhibit to an\namendment to the registration statement of\nwhich this prospectus is a part. See\n\u0093Available Information\u0094 above for information\non how to obtain a copy of a unit agreement\nwhen it is filed.\n\nGeneral Provisions of a Unit Agreement\n\nThe\nfollowing provisions will generally apply to\nall unit agreements unless otherwise stated in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement.\n\nEnforcement of Rights\n\nThe unit agent under a unit agreement will act\nsolely as our agent in connection with the\nunits issued under that agreement. The unit\nagent\nwill not assume any obligation or relationship\nof agency or trust for or with any holders of\nthose units or of the securities comprising\nthose units. The unit agent will not be\nobligated to take any action on behalf of\nthose holders to enforce or\nprotect their rights under the units or the\nincluded securities.\n\nExcept as described in the next paragraph, a\nholder of a unit may, without the\nconsent of the unit agent or any other holder,\nenforce its rights as holder under any\nsecurity included in the unit, in accordance\nwith the terms of that security and the\nwarrant indenture or unit agreement under\nwhich that security is issued. Those\nterms are described elsewhere in this\nprospectus under the sections relating to debt\nsecurities and warrants or the prospectus\nrelating to the relevant debt or equity\nsecurities of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a unit\nagreement may limit or otherwise affect the\nability of a holder of units issued under that\nagreement to enforce\nits rights, including any right to bring a\nlegal action, with respect to those units or\nany securities, other than debt securities and\nwarrants issued under the warrant indenture,\nthat are included in those units. Limitations\nof this kind will be\ndescribed in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement.\n\n89\n\nModifications Without Consent of Holders We,\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and the\napplicable unit agent may amend any unit or\nunit agreement without the consent of any\nholder:\n                              \n      to cure any ambiguity;  \n                              \n                                              \n      to cure, correct or supplement any      \n      defective or inconsistent provision;    \n      or                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      to make any other change that we        \n      believe is necessary or desirable and   \n      will not adversely affect the           \n      interests of the                        \n      affected holders in any material        \n      respect.                                \n                                              \nNeither we nor The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nneeds any approval to make changes that affect\nonly units to be issued after the changes take\neffect. We may also make changes that do not\nadversely affect a particular unit in any\nmaterial respect, even if they adversely\naffect other units in a material respect. In\nthose cases, neither we nor The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. needs to obtain the approval of\nthe holder of the unaffected unit; we and The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. need only obtain any\nrequired approvals from the holders of the\naffected units. The foregoing applies also to\nany security issued under a unit agreement, as\nthe governing document. Modifications With\nConsent of Holders Neither we nor The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. may amend any particular\nunit or a unit agreement with respect to any\nparticular unit unless we and The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. obtain the consent of the\nholder of that unit, if the amendment would:\n                                              \n      impair any right of the holder to       \n      exercise or enforce any right under a   \n      security included in the unit if the    \n      terms of that                           \n      security require the consent of the     \n      holder to any changes that would        \n      impair the exercise or enforcement of   \n      that right; or                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      reduce the percentage of outstanding    \n      units of any series or the consent of   \n      whose holders is required to amend      \n      that series,                            \n      or the applicable unit agreement with   \n      respect to that series, as described    \n      below.                                  \n                                              \nAny other change to a particular unit\nagreement and the units issued under that\nagreement would require the following\napproval:\n                                              \n      If the change affects only the units    \n      of a particular series issued under     \n      that agreement, the change must be      \n      approved by the                         \n      holders of a majority of the            \n      outstanding units of that series.       \n                                              \n                                              \n      If the change affects the units of      \n      more than one series issued under that  \n      agreement, it must be approved by the   \n      holders of                              \n      a majority of all outstanding units of  \n      all series affected by the change,      \n      with the units of all the affected      \n      series voting together as one class     \n      for this purpose.                       \n                                              \nThese provisions regarding changes with\nmajority approval also apply to changes\naffecting any securities issued under a unit\nagreement, as the governing document. In each\ncase, the required approval must be given by\nwritten consent. Unit Agreements Will Not Be\nQualified Under Trust Indenture Act No unit\nagreement will be qualified as an indenture,\nand no unit agent will be required to qualify\nas a trustee, under the Trust Indenture Act.\nTherefore, holders of units issued under unit\nagreements will not have the protections of\nthe Trust Indenture Act with respect to their\nunits; in such a case, if any of 90\n\nthe component securities of the units are\nissued under a governing document qualified\nunder the Trust Indenture Act, the holders\nwill have the protections of the Trust\nIndenture Act with respect to such component\nsecurities as holders of such component\nsecurities. Mergers and Similar Transactions\nPermitted; No Restrictive Covenants or Events\nof Default The unit agreements will not\nrestrict our ability to merge or consolidate\nwith, or sell our or its assets to, another\ncorporation or other entity or to engage in\nany other transactions. If at any time we or\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. merges or\nconsolidates with, or sells our or its assets\nsubstantially as an entirety to, another\ncorporation or other entity, the successor\nentity will succeed to and assume our or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s obligations under\nthe unit agreements. We or The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. will then be relieved of any\nfurther obligation under these agreements. The\nunit agreements will not include any\nrestrictions on The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc.\u0092s ability to put liens on its assets,\nincluding its interests in its subsidiaries\nother than GS&Co., nor will they restrict our\nor The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s ability to\nsell our or its assets. The unit agreements\nalso will not provide for any events of\ndefault (or covenant breaches) or remedies\nupon the occurrence of any events of default\n(or covenant breaches). Governing Law The unit\nagreements and the units will be governed by\nNew York law. Form, Exchange and Transfer Each\nunit will be issued in global \u0097 i.e., book-\nentry \u0097 form only. Units in book-entry form\nwill be represented by a global security\nregistered in the name of a depositary, which\nwill be the holder of all the units\nrepresented by the global security. Those who\nown beneficial interests in a unit will do so\nthrough participants in the depositary\u0092s\nclearing system, and the rights of these\nindirect owners will be governed solely by the\napplicable procedures of the depositary and\nits participants. We describe book-entry\nsecurities below under \u0093Legal Ownership and\nBook-Entry Issuance\u0094. In addition, each unit\nwill be issued in registered form. Each unit\nand all securities comprising the unit will be\nissued in the same form. If we issue any units\nin registered, non-globalform, the following\nwill apply to them. The units will be issued\nin the denominations stated in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. Holders may exchange\ntheir units for units of smaller denominations\nor combined into fewer units of larger\ndenominations, as long as the total amount is\nnot changed.\n                                              \n      Holders may exchange or transfer their  \n      units at the office of the unit agent.  \n      Holders may also replace lost, stolen,  \n      destroyed or mutilated units at that    \n      office. We may appoint another entity   \n      to perform these functions or perform   \n      them ourselves.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      Holders will not be required to pay a   \n      service charge to transfer or exchange  \n      their units, but they may be required   \n      to pay                                  \n      for any tax or other governmental       \n      charge associated with the transfer or  \n      exchange. The transfer or exchange,     \n      and any replacement, will be made only  \n      if our transfer agent is satisfied      \n      with the holder\u0092s proof of legal         \n      ownership. The transfer                 \n      agent may also require an indemnity     \n      before replacing any units.             \n                                              \n                                              \n      If we have the right to redeem,         \n      accelerate or settle any units before   \n      their maturity, and we exercise our     \n      right as to less                        \n      than all those units or other           \n      securities, we may block the            \n                                              \n91\n                                              \n  exchange or transfer of those units during  \n  the period beginning 15 days before the     \n  day we mail the notice of exercise and      \n  ending on the day of that mailing, in       \n  order to freeze the list of holders         \n  to prepare the mailing. We may also refuse  \n  to register transfers of or exchange any    \n  unit selected for early settlement, except  \n  that we will continue to permit transfers   \n  and exchanges of the unsettled portion of   \n  any unit being partially settled. We        \n  may also block the transfer or exchange of  \n  any unit in this manner if the unit         \n  includes securities that are or may be      \n  selected for early settlement.              \n                                              \nOnly the depositary will be entitled to\ntransfer or exchange a unit in global form,\nsince it will be the sole holder of the unit.\nPayments and Notices In making payments and\ngiving notices with respect to our units, we\nwill follow the procedures we plan to use with\nrespect to our debt securities, where\napplicable. We describe those procedures above\nunder \u0093Description of Debt Securities We May\nOffer \u0097 Payment Mechanics for Debt Securities\u0094\nand \u0093Description of Debt Securities We May\nOffer \u0097 Notices\u0094. Guarantee by The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. will fully and unconditionally guarantee\nthe payment on our own securities included in\nthe units, when due and payable, upon\nmaturity, exercise, call for redemption or\notherwise, as the case may be, in accordance\nwith the terms of our securities included in\nthe units, the relevant indenture and the\napplicable prospectus supplement accompanying\nthis prospectus. The guarantee will remain in\neffect until the entire payment, if any, on\nour securities included in the unit has been\npaid in full or discharged in accordance with\nthe provisions of the relevant indenture.\nBecause The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a\nholding company, its ability to perform its\nobligations on the guarantees endorsed on our\nsecurities included in the units will depend\nin part on its ability to participate in\ndistributions of assets from its subsidiaries.\nWe discuss these matters above under\n\u0093Prospectus Summary \u0097 The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. is a Holding Company\u0094. 92\n\nGS FINANCE CORP.

Ownership\nof GS Finance Corp. Out of 100 shares of\nauthorized common stock of GS Finance Corp.,\none share is currently issued and outstanding.\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is the sole\nshareholder of all currently issued and\noutstanding stock of GS Finance Corp.\nGuarantee by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. The\ndebt securities, warrants and units issued by\nGS Finance Corp. will be fully and\nunconditionally guaranteed by The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. as described in this\nprospectus. We expect that the guarantee of\nsecurities of GS Finance Corp. other than\nsubordinated debt securities will rank equally\nin right of payment with all senior\nindebtedness of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.,\nwhereas the guarantee of subordinated debt\nsecurities of GS Finance Corp. will be\nsubordinate and junior in right of payment to\nall senior indebtedness of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. The terms of the guarantee may be\nprovided in more detail in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. Because The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. is a holding company, its\nability to perform its obligations on the\nguarantees of the debt securities, warrants or\nunits issued by GS Finance Corp. depends in\npart on its ability to participate in\ndistributions of assets from its subsidiaries.\nWe discuss these matters above under\n\u0093Prospectus Summary \u0097 The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. is a Holding Company\u0094. 94\n\nLEGAL OWNERSHIP AND BOOK-ENTRY ISSUANCE\n\nIn this section, we describe special\nconsiderations that will apply to registered\nsecurities issued in global \u0097i.e., book-entry\n\u0097\nform. First we describe the difference between\nlegal ownership and indirect ownership of\nregistered securities. Then we describe\nspecial provisions that apply to global\nsecurities.\n\nWho Is the Legal Owner of a Registered\nSecurity?\n\nEach debt security, warrant and unit in\nregistered form will be represented either by\na certificate issued in definitive form to a\nparticular investor or\nby one or more global securities representing\nthe entire issuance of securities. We refer to\nthose who have securities registered in their\nown names, on the books that we or the trustee\nor other agent maintain for this purpose, as\nthe\n\u0093holders\u0094 of those securities. These persons\nare the legal holders of the securities. We\nrefer to those who, indirectly through others,\nown beneficial interests in securities that\nare not registered in their own names as\nindirect owners of\nthose securities. As we discuss below,\nindirect owners are not legal holders, and\ninvestors in securities issued in book-entry\nform or in street name will be indirect\nowners.\n\nBook-Entry Owners\n\nEach security will be issued in\nbook-entry form only. This means securities\nwill be represented by one or more global\nsecurities registered in the name of a\nfinancial institution that holds them as\ndepositary on behalf of other financial\ninstitutions that participate in the\ndepositary\u0092s book- entry system. These\nparticipating institutions, in turn, hold\nbeneficial interests in the securities on\nbehalf of themselves or their customers.\n\nUnder each indenture, only the person in whose\nname a security is registered is recognized as\nthe holder of that security. Consequently, for\nsecurities\nissued in global form, we will recognize only\nthe depositary as the holder of the securities\nand we will make all payments on the\nsecurities to the depositary. The depositary\npasses along the payments it receives to its\nparticipants, which in turn\npass the payments along to their customers who\nare the beneficial owners. The depositary and\nits participants do so under agreements they\nhave made with one another or with their\ncustomers; they are not obligated to do so\nunder the terms of the\nsecurities.\n\nAs a result, investors will not own securities\ndirectly. Instead, they will own beneficial\ninterests in a global security, through a\nbank, broker or other financial institution\nthat participates in the depositary\u0092s book-\nentry system or holds an interest through a\nparticipant. As long as the securities are\nissued in global form, investors will be\nindirect owners, and not\nholders, of the securities.\n\nStreet Name Owners\n\nIn the future we may terminate a global\nsecurity or issue securities initially in non-\nglobal form. In these\ncases, investors may choose to hold their\nsecurities in their own names or in street\nname. Securities held by an investor in street\nname would be registered in the name of a\nbank, broker or other financial institution\nthat the investor chooses, and\nthe investor would hold only a beneficial\ninterest in those securities through an\naccount he or she maintains at that\ninstitution.\n\nFor securities\nheld in street name, we will recognize only\nthe intermediary banks, brokers and other\nfinancial institutions in whose names the\nsecurities are registered as the holders of\nthose securities and we will make all payments\non those securities, including\ndeliveries of any property other than cash, to\nthem. These institutions pass along the\npayments they receive to their customers who\nare the beneficial owners, but only because\nthey agree to do so in their customer\nagreements or because they are\nlegally required to do so. Investors who hold\nsecurities in street name will be indirect\nowners, not holders, of those securities.\n\n95\n\nLegal Holders Our obligations, the obligations\nof The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., as\nguarantor, as well as the obligations of the\ntrustee under any indenture and the\nobligations, if any, of unit agents and any\nother third parties employed by us, the\ntrustee or any of those agents, run only to\nthe holders of the securities. Neither we nor\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. has any\nobligations to investors who hold beneficial\ninterests in global securities, in street name\nor by any other indirect means. This will be\nthe case whether an investor chooses to be an\nindirect owner of a security or has no choice\nbecause we are issuing the securities only in\nglobal form. For example, once we or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. make a payment or\ngive a notice to the holder, neither we nor\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. has any further\nresponsibility for that payment or notice even\nif that holder is required, under agreements\nwith depositary participants or customers or\nby law, to pass it along to the indirect\nowners but does not do so. Similarly, if we or\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. wants to obtain\nthe approval of the holders for any purpose \u0097\ne.g., to amend the warrant indenture for a\nparticular series of warrants or to relieve us\nof the consequences of a default or of our\nobligation to comply with a particular\nprovision of an indenture \u0097 we or The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. would seek the approval only\nfrom the holders, and not the indirect owners,\nof the relevant securities. Whether and how\nthe holders contact the indirect owners is up\nto the holders. When we refer to \u0093you\u0094 in this\nprospectus, we mean those who invest in the\nsecurities being offered by this prospectus,\nwhether they are the holders or only indirect\nowners of those securities. When we refer to\n\u0093your securities\u0094 in this prospectus, we mean\nthe securities in which you will hold a direct\nor indirect interest. Special Considerations\nfor Indirect Owners If you hold securities\nthrough a bank, broker or other financial\ninstitution, either in book-entry form or in\nstreet name, you should check with your own\ninstitution to find out:\n                                              \n      how it handles securities payments and  \n      notices;                                \n                                              \n                                           \n      whether it imposes fees or charges;  \n                                           \n                                              \n      whether and how you can instruct it to  \n      exercise any rights under the           \n      securities;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      how it would handle a request for the   \n      holders\u0092 consent, if ever required;      \n                                              \n                                              \n      whether and how you can instruct it to  \n      send you securities registered in your  \n      own name so you can be a holder, if     \n      that is                                 \n      permitted in the future;                \n                                              \n                                              \n      how it would exercise rights under the  \n      securities if there were a default or   \n      other event triggering the need for     \n      holders to                              \n      act to protect their interests; and     \n                                              \n                                              \n      if the securities are in book-entry     \n      form, how the depositary\u0092s rules and     \n      procedures will affect these matters.   \n                                              \nWhat Is a Global Security? Each security will\nbe issued in book-entry form only. Each\nsecurity issued in book-entry form will be\nrepresented by a global security that we\ndeposit with and register in the name of one\nor more financial institutions or clearing\nsystems, or their nominees, which we select. A\nfinancial institution or clearing system that\nwe select for any security for this purpose is\ncalled the \u0093depositary\u0094 for that security. A\nsecurity will usually have only one depositary\nbut it may have more. 96\n\nEach security will have one or more of the\nfollowing as the depositaries:\n                                              \n      The Depository Trust Company, New       \n      York, New York, which is known as \u0093DTC\u0094;  \n                                              \n                                              \n      a financial institution holding the     \n      securities on behalf of Euroclear Bank  \n      SA/NV, which is known as \u0093Euroclear\u0094;     \n                                              \n                                              \n      a financial institution holding the     \n      securities on behalf of Clearstream     \n      Banking, soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme, which is      \n      known as \u0093Clearstream\u0094; and               \n                                              \n                                              \n      any other clearing system or financial  \n      institution named in the applicable     \n      prospectus supplement.                  \n                                              \nThe depositaries named above may also be\nparticipants in one another\u0092s clearing\nsystems. Thus, for example, if DTC is the\ndepositary for a global security, investors\nmay hold beneficial interests in that security\nthrough Euroclear or Clearstream, as DTC\nparticipants. The depositary or depositaries\nfor your securities will be named in your\nprospectus supplement; if none is named, the\ndepositary will be DTC. A global security may\nrepresent one or any other number of\nindividual securities. Generally, all\nsecurities represented by the same global\nsecurity will have the same terms. We may,\nhowever, issue a global security that\nrepresents multiple securities of the same\nkind, such as debt securities, that have\ndifferent terms and are issued at different\ntimes. We call this kind of global security a\nmaster global security. Your prospectus\nsupplement will not indicate whether your\nsecurities are represented by a master global\nsecurity. A global security may not be\ntransferred to or registered in the name of\nanyone other than the depositary or its\nnominee, unless special termination situations\narise. We describe those situations below\nunder \u0093\u0097 Holder\u0092s Option to Obtain a Non-\nGlobalSecurity; Special Situations When a\nGlobal Security Will Be Terminated\u0094. If\ntermination occurs, we may issue the\nsecurities through another book-entry clearing\nsystem or decide that the securities may no\nlonger be held through any book-entry clearing\nsystem. The depositary, or its nominee, will\nbe the sole registered owner and holder of all\nsecurities represented by a global security,\nand investors will be permitted to own only\nindirect interests in a global security.\nIndirect interests must be held by means of an\naccount with a broker, bank or other financial\ninstitution that in turn has an account with\nthe depositary or with another institution\nthat does. Thus, an investor whose security is\nrepresented by a global security will not be a\nholder of the security, but only an indirect\nowner of an interest in the global security.\nSpecial Considerations for Global Securities\nAs an indirect owner, an investor\u0092s rights\nrelating to a global security will be governed\nby the account rules of the depositary and\nthose of the investor\u0092s financial institution\nor other intermediary through which it holds\nits interest ( e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream,\nif DTC is the depositary), as well as general\nlaws relating to securities transfers. We do\nnot recognize this type of investor or any\nintermediary as a holder of securities and\ninstead deal only with the depositary that\nholds the global security. If securities are\nissued only in the form of a global security,\nan investor should be aware of the following:\n                                              \n      An investor cannot cause the            \n      securities to be registered in his or   \n      her own name, and cannot obtain         \n      non-global certificates for his or her  \n      interest in the securities, except in   \n      the special situations we describe      \n      below;                                  \n                                              \n97\n                                              \n      An investor will be an indirect holder  \n      and must look to his or her own bank    \n      or broker for payments on the           \n      securities and                          \n      protection of his or her legal rights   \n      relating to the securities, as we       \n      describe above under \u0093\u0097 Who Is the Legal  \n      Owner of a Registered Security?\u0094;        \n                                              \n                                              \n      An investor may not be able to sell     \n      interests in the securities to some     \n      insurance companies and other           \n      institutions that are                   \n      required by law to own their            \n      securities in non-book-entry form;      \n                                              \n                                              \n      An investor may not be able to pledge   \n      his or her interest in a global         \n      security in circumstances where         \n      certificates                            \n      representing the securities must be     \n      delivered to the lender or other        \n      beneficiary of the pledge in order for  \n      the pledge to be effective;             \n                                              \n                                              \n      The depositary\u0092s policies will govern    \n      payments, deliveries, transfers,        \n      exchanges, notices and other matters    \n      relating                                \n      to an investor\u0092s interest in a global    \n      security, and those policies may        \n      change from time to time. We, the       \n      trustee and unit agents will have no    \n      responsibility for any aspect of the    \n      depositary\u0092s policies, actions or        \n      records of ownership                    \n      interests in a global security. We,     \n      the trustee and unit agents also do     \n      not supervise the depositary in any     \n      way;                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      The depositary will require that those  \n      who purchase and sell interests in a    \n      global security within its book-entry   \n      system                                  \n      use immediately available funds and     \n      your broker or bank may require you to  \n      do so as well; and                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      Financial institutions that             \n      participate in the depositary\u0092s          \n      book-entry system and through which an  \n      investor holds its                      \n      interest in the global securities,      \n      directly or indirectly, may also have   \n      their own policies affecting payments,  \n      deliveries, transfers, exchanges,       \n      notices and other matters relating to   \n      the securities, and those policies may  \n      change from time to time.               \n      For example, if you hold an interest    \n      in a global security through Euroclear  \n      or Clearstream, when DTC is the         \n      depositary, Euroclear or Clearstream,   \n      as applicable, will require those who   \n      purchase and sell interests in that     \n      security through them to use            \n      immediately available funds and comply  \n      with other policies and procedures,     \n      including deadlines for giving          \n      instructions as to transactions that    \n      are to be effected on a particular      \n      day. There may be more than one         \n      financial intermediary in the chain of  \n      ownership for an investor. Neither we   \n      nor The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.       \n      monitors or is responsible for the      \n      policies or actions or records of       \n      ownership interests of any of those     \n      intermediaries.                         \n                                              \nHolder\u0092s Option to Obtain a Non-\nGlobalSecurity; Special Situations When a\nGlobal Security Will Be Terminated If we issue\nany particular securities or series of\nsecurities in book-entry form but we choose to\ngive the beneficial owners of those particular\nsecurities or series of securities the right\nto obtain non-globalsecurities, any beneficial\nowner entitled to obtain non-globalsecurities\nmay do so by following the applicable\nprocedures of the depositary, any transfer\nagent or registrar for those securities or\nthat series of securities and that owner\u0092s\nbank, broker or other financial institution\nthrough which that owner holds its beneficial\ninterest in the securities. For example, in\nthe case of a global security representing\ndebt securities, a beneficial owner will be\nentitled to obtain a non-globalsecurity\nrepresenting its interest by making a written\nrequest to the transfer agent or other agent\ndesignated by us. If you are entitled to\nrequest a non-globalcertificate and wish to do\nso, you will need to allow sufficient lead\ntime to enable us or our agent to prepare the\nrequested certificate. In addition, in a few\nspecial situations described below, a global\nsecurity will be terminated and interests in\nit will be exchanged for certificates in non-\nglobalform representing the securities it\nrepresented. After that exchange, the choice\nof whether to hold the securities directly or\nin street name will be up to the investor.\nInvestors must consult their own banks or\nbrokers to find out how to have their\ninterests in a global security transferred on\ntermination to their own names, so that they\nwill be holders. We have described the rights\nof holders and street name investors above\nunder \u0093\u0097 Who Is the Legal Owner of a\nRegistered Security?\u0094 98\n\nThe special situations for termination of a\nglobal security are as follows:\n                                              \n      if the depositary notifies us that it   \n      is unwilling, unable or no longer       \n      qualified to continue as depositary     \n      for that global                         \n      security and we do not appoint another  \n      institution to act as depositary        \n      within 60 days;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      if we notify the trustee or unit        \n      agent, as applicable, that we wish to   \n      terminate that global security; or      \n                                              \n                                              \n      in the case of a global security        \n      representing debt securities or         \n      warrants issued under an indenture, if  \n      an event of default                     \n      has occurred with regard to such        \n      securities and has not been cured or    \n      waived.                                 \n                                              \nDTC\u0092s current rules provide that it would\nnotify its participants of a request by us to\nterminate a global security, but will only\nwithdraw beneficial interests from the global\nsecurity at the request of each DTC\nparticipant. If a global security is\nterminated, only the depositary, and not we,\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., the trustee for\nany debt securities or warrants or the unit\nagent for any units, is responsible for\ndeciding the names of the institutions in\nwhose names the securities represented by the\nglobal security will be registered and,\ntherefore, who will be the holders of those\nsecurities. Considerations Relating to\nEuroclear and Clearstream Euroclear and\nClearstream are securities clearing systems in\nEurope. Both systems clear and settle\nsecurities transactions between their\nparticipants through electronic, book-entry\ndelivery of securities against payment.\nEuroclear and Clearstream may be depositaries\nfor a global security. In addition, if DTC is\nthe depositary for a global security,\nEuroclear and Clearstream may hold interests\nin the global security as participants in DTC.\nAs long as any global security is held by\nEuroclear or Clearstream, as depositary, you\nmay hold an interest in the global security\nonly through an organization that\nparticipates, directly or indirectly, in\nEuroclear or Clearstream. If Euroclear or\nClearstream is the depositary for a global\nsecurity and there is no depositary in the\nUnited States, you will not be able to hold\ninterests in that global security through any\nsecurities clearance system in the United\nStates. Payments, deliveries, transfers,\nexchanges, notices and other matters relating\nto the securities made through Euroclear or\nClearstream must comply with the rules and\nprocedures of those systems. Those clearing\nsystems could change their rules and\nprocedures at any time. Neither we nor The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. has any control over\nthose systems or their participants, and\nneither we nor The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\ntake any responsibility for their activities.\nTransactions between participants in Euroclear\nor Clearstream, on one hand, and participants\nin DTC, on the other hand, when DTC is the\ndepositary, would also be subject to DTC\u0092s\nrules and procedures. Special Timing\nConsiderations for Transactions in Euroclear\nand Clearstream Investors will be able to make\nand receive through Euroclear and Clearstream\npayments, deliveries, transfers, exchanges,\nnotices and other transactions involving any\nsecurities held through those clearing systems\nonly on days when those systems are open for\nbusiness. These clearing systems may not be\nopen for business on days when banks, brokers\nand other institutions are open for business\nin the United States. 99\n\nIn addition, because of time-zone differences,\nU.S. investors who hold their interests in the\nsecurities through these clearing systems and\nwish to transfer their interests, or to\nreceive or make a payment or delivery or\nexercise any other right with respect to their\ninterests, on a particular day may find that\nthe transaction will not be\neffected until the next business day in\nLuxembourg or Brussels, as applicable. Thus,\ninvestors who wish to exercise rights that\nexpire on a particular day may need to act\nbefore the expiration date. In addition,\ninvestors who hold their interests\nthrough both DTC and Euroclear or Clearstream\nmay need to make special arrangements to\nfinance any purchases or sales of their\ninterests between the U.S. and European\nclearing systems, and those transactions may\nsettle later than would be the case\nfor transactions within one clearing system.\n\n100\n\nCONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO FLOATING RATE\nSECURITIES\n\nLIBOR May Be Discontinued; Discontinuance\nDates May Differ for Different LIBOR\nCurrencies and Tenors\n\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the\nU.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\u0093FCA\u0094),\nwhich regulates the LIBOR administrator,\nannounced\nthat the FCA will no longer persuade or compel\nbanks to submit rates for the calculation of\nLIBOR after 2021. On November 30, 2020, the\nICE Benchmark Administration Limited (\u0093IBA\u0094),\nwhich is supervised by the UK Financial\nConduct\nAuthority, announced a proposal to extend the\npublication of the most commonly used LIBOR\ntenors (overnight and one, three, six and 12\nmonths) until June 30, 2023. The Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency have strongly\nencouraged banks to cease entering into new\ncontracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference\nrate as soon as practicable and in any event\nby December 31, 2021.\nThe IBA has also proposed to cease publishing\nLIBOR for other tenors and currencies on\nDecember 31, 2021. Although the foregoing may\nprovide some sense of timing, there is no\nassurance that LIBOR, of any particular\ncurrency and tenor, will\ncontinue to be published until any particular\ndate, and it appears highly likely that LIBOR\nwill be discontinued or modified after\nDecember 31, 2021 or June 30, 2023, depending\non the currency and tenor.\n\nIt is not possible to predict the effect that\nthese announcements or any such discontinuance\nwill have on LIBOR or on floating rate\nsecurities linked to\nLIBOR (\u0093LIBOR-linked securities\u0094). If the\ncalculation agent determines that a benchmark\ntransition event and its related benchmark\nreplacement date have occurred with respect to\nLIBOR for particular LIBOR-linked securities,\nthen a\nbenchmark replacement will be selected by the\ncalculation agent in accordance with the\nbenchmark transition provisions of the\nrelevant securities. The selection of a\nbenchmark replacement, and any decisions,\ndeterminations or elections made by the\ncalculation agent in connection with\nimplementing a benchmark replacement with\nrespect to LIBOR-linked securities in\naccordance with the relevant benchmark\ntransition provisions could result in adverse\nconsequences to the interest rate, which could\nadversely affect the return on, value of and\nmarket for LIBOR-linked securities. Further,\nthere is no assurance that the characteristics\nof any benchmark replacement will be similar\nto LIBOR, or that any benchmark replacement\nwill produce the\neconomic equivalent of LIBOR. See \u0093Description\nof Debt Securities We May Offer \u0097 Calculations\nof Interest on Debt Securities \u0097 Floating Rate\nDebt Securities \u0097 LIBOR\u0094. Regulation and\nReform of \u0093Benchmarks\u0094,\nIncluding LIBOR and Other Types of Benchmarks,\nMay Cause such \u0093Benchmarks\u0094 to Perform\nDifferently Than in the Past, or to Disappear\nEntirely, or Have Other Consequences Which\nCannot be Predicted\n\nLIBOR and other interest rate, equity, foreign\nexchange rate and other types of indices which\nare deemed to be \u0093benchmarks\u0094 are the subject\nof\nrecent international, national and other\nregulatory guidance and proposals for reform.\nSome of these reforms are already effective\nwhile others are still to be implemented.\nThese reforms may cause such \u0093benchmarks\u0094 to\nperform differently\nthan in the past, or to disappear entirely, or\nhave other consequences which cannot be\npredicted. Any such consequence could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on your floating rate\nsecurities.\n\nAny of the international, national or other\nproposals for reform or the general increased\nregulatory scrutiny of \u0093benchmarks\u0094 could\nincrease\nthe costs and risks of administering or\notherwise participating in the setting of a\n\u0093benchmark\u0094 and complying with any such\nregulations or requirements. Such factors may\nhave the effect of discouraging market\nparticipants from continuing\nto administer or contribute to certain\n\u0093benchmarks\u0094, trigger changes in the rules or\nmethodologies used in certain \u0093benchmarks\u0094 or\nlead to the disappearance of certain\n\u0093benchmarks\u0094. The disappearance of a\n\u0093benchmark\u0094 or changes in the manner of\nadministration of a \u0093benchmark\u0094 could result\nin discretionary valuation by the calculation\nagent or other consequence in relation to your\nfloating rate securities. Any such consequence\ncould have a material adverse effect on the\nvalue of and return on your floating rate\nsecurities.\n\n101\n\nCertain Risks Related to LIBOR\n\nUnder the benchmark transition provisions of\ncertain of our LIBOR-linked securities, if a\nbenchmark transition event and its related\nbenchmark\nreplacement date have occurred with respect to\nLIBOR, then the rate of interest on the LIBOR-\nlinked securities will be determined based on\nSOFR.\n\nThe composition and characteristics of SOFR\nare not the same as those of LIBOR and SOFR is\nfundamentally different from LIBOR for two key\nreasons.\nFirst, SOFR is a secured rate, while LIBOR is\nan unsecured rate. Second, SOFR is an\novernight rate, while LIBOR is a forward-\nlooking rate that represents interbank funding\nover different maturities (e.g., three\nmonths). As a result, there can be no\nassurance that SOFR (including term SOFR or\ncompounded SOFR) will perform in the same way\nas LIBOR would have at any time, including,\nwithout limitation, as a result of changes in\ninterest and yield rates in the market, market\nvolatility or global\nor regional economic, financial, political,\nregulatory, judicial or other events. See \u0093\u0097\nCertain Risks Related to SOFR\u0094 below.\n\nAdditionally, LIBOR-linked securities which\nhave benchmark transition provisions may not\nhave an established trading market if a\nbenchmark transition\nevent and its related benchmark replacement\ndate have occurred, and an established trading\nmarket in each case may never develop or may\nnot be very liquid.\n\nCertain Risks Related to SOFR\n\nOn June 22, 2017,\nthe Alternative Reference Rates Committee\n(\u0093ARRC\u0094) convened by the Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System and the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York identified SOFR, a\nbroad U.S. treasuries repurchase financing\nrate to be published\nby the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as\nthe rate that, in the consensus view of the\nARRC, represented best practice for use in\ncertain new U.S. dollar derivatives and other\nfinancial contracts. SOFR is a broad measure\nof the cost of borrowing\ncash overnight collateralized by U.S. treasury\nsecurities and has been published by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York since April\n2018. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has\nalso published historical indicative Secured\nOvernight Financing\nRates going back to 2014. Investors should not\nrely on any historical changes or trends in\nSOFR as an indicator of future changes in\nSOFR.\n\nBecause\nSOFR is published by the Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York based on data received from other\nsources, we have no control over its\ndetermination, calculation or publication. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York notes on its\npublication page for SOFR\nthat use of SOFR is subject to important\nlimitations and disclaimers, including that\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York may alter\nthe methods of calculation, publication\nschedule, rate revision practices or\navailability of SOFR at any time without\nnotice. There can be no guarantee,\nparticularly given its relatively recent\nintroduction, that SOFR will not be\ndiscontinued or fundamentally altered in a\nmanner that is materially adverse to the\ninterests of investors in SOFR-linked floating\nrate\nsecurities. If the manner in which SOFR is\ncalculated is changed, that change may result\nin a reduction of the amount of interest\npayable on SOFR-linked floating rate\nsecurities and the trading prices of such\nsecurities. In addition, the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York may withdraw, modify\nor amend published SOFR data in its sole\ndiscretion and without notice. The interest\nrate for any day will not be adjusted for any\nmodifications or amendments to SOFR data that\nthe Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York may publish after the interest\nrate for that day has been determined.\n\nAdditionally, daily changes in SOFR have, on\noccasion, been more\nvolatile than daily changes in other benchmark\nor market rates. Although occasional,\nincreased daily volatility in SOFR would not\nnecessarily lead to more volatile interest\npayments, the return on and value of SOFR-\nlinked floating rate securities\nmay fluctuate more than floating rate\nsecurities that are linked to less volatile\nrates. In addition, the volatility of SOFR has\nreflected the underlying volatility of the\novernight U.S. Treasury repo market. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York has\nat times conducted operations in the\n\n102\n\novernight U.S. Treasury repo market in order\nto help maintain the federal funds rate within\na target range. There can be no assurance that\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York will\ncontinue to\nconduct such operations in the future, and the\nduration and extent of any such operations is\ninherently uncertain. The effect of any such\noperations, or of the cessation of such\noperations to the extent they are commenced,\nis uncertain and could be\nmaterially adverse to investors in SOFR-linked\nfloating rate securities.\n\nSince SOFR is a relatively new reference rate,\nSOFR-linked floating rate\nsecurities may not have an established trading\nmarket when issued, and an established trading\nmarket in each case may never develop or may\nnot be very liquid. Market terms for floating-\nrate securities linked to SOFR, such as the\nspread over the base\nrate reflected in interest rate provisions or\nthe manner of compounding the base rate, may\nevolve over time, and trading prices of such\nsecurities may be lower than those of later-\nissued SOFR-linked floating rate securities as\na result. Similarly,\nif SOFR does not prove to be widely used in\nfloating rate securities, the trading price of\nSOFR-linked floating rate securities may be\nlower than those of securities linked to\nreference rates that are more widely used.\nInvestors in such securities\nmay not be able to sell such securities at all\nor may not be able to sell such securities at\nprices that will provide them with a yield\ncomparable to similar investments that have a\ndeveloped secondary market, and may\nconsequently suffer from\nincreased pricing volatility and market risk.\n\nThe Calculation Agent Will Have the Authority\nto Make Determinations That Could Affect the\nMarket Value of Your Floating Rate Securities\n\nIf GS&Co. is named as calculation agent for\nyour floating rate securities, GS&Co. will\nmake determinations\nwith respect to the floating rate securities\nas specified herein and in your prospectus\nsupplement and may have discretion in\ncalculating the amounts payable in respect of\nthe floating rate securities. If GS&Co.\ndetermines that a benchmark\nreplacement date with respect to LIBOR-linked\nfloating rate securities or SOFR-linked\nfloating rate securities has occurred, it will\ndetermine, among other things, the applicable\nbenchmark replacement, the applicable\nbenchmark replacement\nadjustment, and the applicable benchmark\nreplacement conforming changes, and such\ndeterminations will be conclusive and binding\nabsent manifest error. The exercise of this\ndiscretion by GS&Co. could adversely affect\nthe value of your floating\nrate securities and may present GS&Co. with a\nconflict of interest. We may change the\ncalculation agent at any time without notice,\nand the calculation agent may resign as\ncalculation agent at any time upon 60 days\u0092\nwritten notice to us.\n\n103\n\nCONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO INDEXED SECURITIES\n\nWe use the term \u0093indexed securities\u0094 to mean\nany of the securities described in this\nprospectus, or any units that include\nsecurities, whose\nvalue is linked to an underlying asset or\nindex or another property (including one or\nmore securities or indices of securities).\nIndexed securities may present a high level of\nrisk, and investors in certain indexed\nsecurities may lose their entire\ninvestment. In addition, the treatment of\nindexed securities for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes is often unclear due to the absence\nof any authority specifically addressing the\nissues presented by any particular indexed\nsecurity. Thus, if you\npropose to invest in indexed securities, you\nshould independently evaluate the federal\nincome tax consequences of purchasing an\nindexed security that apply in your particular\ncircumstances. You should also read \u0093United\nStates Taxation\u0094\nbelow for a discussion of U.S. tax matters.\n\nWe May Engage in Hedging Activities that Could\nAdversely Affect an Indexed Security\n\nIn order to hedge an exposure on a particular\nindexed security, we may, directly or through\nour affiliates, enter into transactions\ninvolving the\nsecurities, commodities or currencies or other\ninstruments or measures that underlie the\nindex for that security, or derivative\ninstruments, such as swaps, options or\nfutures, on the index or any of its component\nitems. By engaging in transactions\nof this kind, we could adversely affect the\nvalue of an indexed security. It is possible\nthat we could achieve substantial returns from\nour hedging transactions while the value of\nthe indexed security may decline.\n\nWe May Have Conflicts of Interest Regarding an\nIndexed Security\n\nGS&Co. and our other affiliates may have\nconflicts of interest with respect to some\nindexed securities. GS&Co. and our other\naffiliates may\nengage in trading, including trading for\nhedging purposes, for their own accounts or\nfor other accounts under their management, in\nindexed securities and in the securities,\ncommodities or currencies or other instruments\nor measures on which the\nindex is based or in other derivative\ninstruments related to the index or its\ncomponent items. These trading activities\ncould adversely affect the value of indexed\nsecurities. We and our affiliates may also\nissue or underwrite securities or\nderivative instruments that are linked to the\nsame index as one or more indexed securities.\nBy introducing competing products into the\nmarketplace in this manner, we could adversely\naffect the value of an indexed security.\n\nGS&Co. or another of our affiliates may serve\nas calculation agent for the indexed\nsecurities and may have considerable\ndiscretion in calculating\nthe amounts payable in respect of the\nsecurities. To the extent that GS&Co. or\nanother of our affiliates calculates or\ncompiles a particular index, it may also have\nconsiderable discretion in performing the\ncalculation or compilation of the\nindex. Exercising discretion in this manner\ncould adversely affect the value of an indexed\nsecurity based on the index or the rate of\nreturn on the security.\n\n104\n\nCONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO SECURITIES\nDENOMINATED OR PAYABLE IN OR LINKED TO A\nNON-U.S.DOLLAR CURRENCY If you intend to\ninvest in a non-U.S.dollar security \u0097 e.g., a\nsecurity whose principal and/or interest is\npayable in a currency other than U.S. dollars\nor that may be settled by delivery of or\nreference to a non-U.S.dollar currency or\nproperty denominated in or otherwise linked to\na non-U.S.dollar currency \u0097 you should consult\nyour own financial and legal advisors as to\nthe currency risks entailed by your\ninvestment. Securities of this kind may not be\nan appropriate investment for investors who\nare unsophisticated with respect to\nnon-U.S.dollar currency transactions. The\ninformation in this prospectus is directed\nprimarily to investors who are U.S. residents.\nInvestors who are not U.S. residents should\nconsult their own financial and legal advisors\nabout currency-related risks particular to\ntheir investment. An Investment in a\nNon-U.S.Dollar Security Involves Currency-\nRelated Risks An investment in a\nnon-U.S.dollar security entails significant\nrisks that are not associated with a similar\ninvestment in a security that is payable\nsolely in U.S. dollars and where settlement\nvalue is not otherwise based on a\nnon-U.S.dollar currency. These risks include\nthe possibility of significant changes in\nrates of exchange between the U.S. dollar and\nthe various non-U.S.dollar currencies or\ncomposite currencies and the possibility of\nthe imposition or modification of foreign\nexchange controls or other conditions by\neither the United States or\nnon-U.S.governments. These risks generally\ndepend on factors over which we have no\ncontrol, such as economic and political events\nand the supply of and demand for the relevant\ncurrencies in the global markets. Changes in\nCurrency Exchange Rates Can Be Volatile and\nUnpredictable Rates of exchange between the\nU.S. dollar and many other currencies have\nbeen highly volatile, and this volatility may\ncontinue and perhaps spread to other\ncurrencies in the future. Fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates could adversely affect\nan investment in a security denominated in, or\nwhose value is otherwise linked to, a\nspecified currency other than U.S. dollars.\nDepreciation of the specified currency against\nthe U.S. dollar could result in a decrease in\nthe U.S. dollar-equivalent value of payments\non the security, including the principal\npayable at maturity or settlement value\npayable upon exercise. That in turn could\ncause the market value of the security to\nfall. Depreciation of the specified currency\nagainst the U.S. dollar could result in a loss\nto the investor on a U.S. dollar basis.\nExchange rates are the result of the supply\nof, and the demand for, the relevant\ncurrencies. Changes in exchange rates result\nover time, and may vary considerably during\nthe life of an investment denominated in or\notherwise relating to a foreign currency, from\nthe interaction of many factors directly or\nindirectly affecting economic and political\nconditions in the country or area of the\napplicable currency, including economic and\npolitical developments in other countries. Of\nparticular importance to potential currency\nexchange risk are:\n                                              \n      existing and expected rates of          \n      inflation;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      existing and expected interest rate     \n      levels;                                 \n                                              \n                                \n      the balance of payments;  \n                                \n                                              \n      the extent of governmental surpluses    \n      or deficits in the relevant countries;  \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      other financial, economic, military     \n      and political factors.                  \n                                              \nAll of these factors are, in turn, sensitive\nto the monetary, fiscal and trade policies\npursued by the government of the applicable\ncountry and other countries important to\ninternational trade and finance. 105\n\nIt has been reported that the U.K. Financial\nConduct Authority and regulators from other\ncountries,\nincluding the United States, are in the\nprocess of investigating the potential\nmanipulation of published currency exchange\nrates. If such manipulation has occurred or is\ncontinuing, certain published exchange rates\nmay have been, or may be in the\nfuture, artificially lower (or higher) than\nthey would otherwise have been. Any such\nmanipulation could have an adverse impact on\nany payments on, and the value of, an\ninvestment in a security denominated in, or\nwhose value is otherwise linked to, a\nspecified currency other than U.S. dollars,\nincluding the value of any such investment in\nthe trading markets. In addition, we cannot\npredict whether any changes or reforms\naffecting the determination or publication of\nexchange rates or the\nsupervision of currency trading will be\nimplemented in connection with these\ninvestigations. Any such changes or reforms\ncould also adversely impact any such\ninvestment.\n\nGovernment Policy Can Adversely Affect Foreign\nCurrency Exchange Rates and an Investment in a\nNon-U.S.Dollar Security\n\nForeign currency exchange rates can either\nfloat or be fixed by sovereign governments.\nFrom time to time, governments use a variety\nof\ntechniques, such as intervention by a\ncountry\u0092s central bank or imposition of\nregulatory controls or taxes, to affect the\nexchange rate of their currencies. Governments\nmay also issue a new currency to replace an\nexisting currency or alter the\nexchange rate or exchange characteristics by\ndevaluation or revaluation of a currency.\nThus, a special risk in purchasing non-U.S.\ndollar securities is that their yields or\npayouts could be significantly and\nunpredictably affected by governmental\nactions. Even in the absence of governmental\naction directly affecting currency exchange\nrates, political or economic developments in\nthe country issuing the specified currency for\na non-U.S. dollar security or elsewhere could\nlead to significant and sudden changes in the\nexchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the\nspecified currency. These changes could affect\nthe value of the security as\nparticipants in the global currency markets\nmove to buy or sell the specified currency or\nU.S. dollars in reaction to these\ndevelopments.\n\nGovernments have imposed from time to time and\nmay in the future impose exchange controls or\nother conditions, including taxes, with\nrespect to the\nexchange or transfer of a specified currency\nthat could affect exchange rates as well as\nthe availability of a specified currency for a\nsecurity at its maturity or on any other\npayment date. In addition, the ability of a\nholder to move currency\nfreely out of the country in which payment in\nthe currency is received or to convert the\ncurrency at a freely determined market rate\ncould be limited by governmental actions.\n\nNon-U.S.Dollar Securities May Permit Us to\nMake Payments in U.S. Dollars or Delay Payment\nIf We Are Unable to Obtain the Specified\nCurrency\n\nSecurities payable in a currency other than\nU.S. dollars may provide that, if the other\ncurrency is subject to\nconvertibility, transferability, market\ndisruption or other conditions affecting its\navailability at or about the time when a\npayment on the securities comes due because of\ncircumstances beyond our control, we will be\nentitled to make the payment in\nU.S. dollars or delay making the payment.\nThese circumstances could include the\nimposition of exchange controls or our\ninability to obtain the other currency because\nof a disruption in the currency markets. If we\nmade payment in U.S. dollars, the\nexchange rate we would use would be determined\nin the manner described above under\n\u0093Description of Debt Securities We May Offer \u0097\nPayment Mechanics for Debt Securities \u0097 How We\nWill Make Payments Due in Other Currencies \u0097\nWhen\nthe Specified Currency Is Not Available\u0094. A\ndetermination of this kind may be based on\nlimited information and would involve\nsignificant discretion on the part of our\nexchange rate agent, which may be an affiliate\nof ours. As a result, the\nvalue of the payment in U.S. dollars an\ninvestor would receive on the payment date may\nbe less than the value of the payment the\ninvestor would have received in the other\ncurrency if it had been available, or may be\nzero. In addition, a government\nmay impose extraordinary taxes on transfers of\na currency. If that happens we will be\nentitled to deduct these taxes from any\npayment on securities payable in that\ncurrency.\n\n106\n\nWe Will Not Adjust Non-U.S.Dollar Securities\nto Compensate for Changes in Foreign Currency\nExchange Rates\n\nExcept as described above, we will not make\nany adjustment or change in the terms of a\nnon-U.S. dollar security in the event of any\nchange in foreign currency exchange rates for\nthe relevant currency, whether in the event of\nany devaluation, revaluation or imposition of\nexchange or other regulatory\ncontrols or taxes or in the event of other\ndevelopments affecting that currency, the U.S.\ndollar or any other currency. Consequently,\ninvestors in non-U.S. dollar securities will\nbear the risk that their\ninvestment may be adversely affected by these\ntypes of events.\n\nIn a Lawsuit for Payment on a Non-U.S.Dollar\nSecurity, an Investor May Bear Foreign\nCurrency Exchange Risk\n\nOur debt securities, warrants and units will\nbe governed by New York law.\nUnder Section 27 of the New York Judiciary\nLaw, a state court in the State of New York\nrendering a judgment on a security denominated\nin a currency other than U.S. dollars would be\nrequired to render the judgment in the\nspecified currency;\nhowever, the judgment would be converted into\nU.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing\non the date of entry of the judgment.\nConsequently, in a lawsuit for payment on a\nsecurity denominated in a currency other than\nU.S. dollars, investors would\nbear currency exchange risk until judgment is\nentered, which could be a long time.\n\nIn courts outside of New York, investors may\nnot be able to\nobtain judgment in a specified currency other\nthan U.S. dollars. For example, a judgment for\nmoney in an action based on a non-U.S. dollar\nsecurity in many other U.S. federal or state\ncourts ordinarily would\nbe enforced in the United States only in U.S.\ndollars. The date used to determine the rate\nof conversion of the currency in which any\nparticular security is denominated into U.S.\ndollars will depend upon various factors,\nincluding which court\nrenders the judgment.\n\nInformation About Foreign Currency Exchange\nRates May Not Be Indicative of Future\nPerformance\n\nIf we issue a non-U.S. dollar security, we may\ninclude in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement a currency\nsupplement that provides information about\nhistorical exchange rates for the relevant\nnon-U.S. dollar currency or currencies. Any\ninformation about exchange rates that we may\nprovide will be furnished as a\nmatter of information only, and you should not\nregard the information as indicative of the\nrange of, or trends in, fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates that may occur in the\nfuture. That rate will likely differ from the\nexchange rate used under\nthe terms that apply to a particular security.\n\nDeterminations Made by the Exchange Rate Agent\n\nAll determinations made by the exchange rate\nagent will be made in its sole discretion\n(except to the extent expressly provided in\nthis prospectus or in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement that any\ndetermination is subject to approval by The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc.). In the absence of\nmanifest error, its determinations will be\nconclusive for all purposes and will bind all\nholders and us. The\nexchange rate agent will not have any\nliability for its determinations.\n\n107\n\nUNITED STATES TAXATION This section describes\nthe material United States federal income tax\nconsequences of owning certain of the debt\nsecurities and warrants we are offering.

These laws are subject to change,\npossibly on a retroactive basis. If an entity\nor arrangement that is treated as a\npartnership for United States federal income\ntax purposes holds the debt securities, the\nUnited States federal income tax treatment of\na partner will generally depend on the status\nof the partner and the tax treatment of the\npartnership. A partner in a partnership\nholding the debt securities should consult its\ntax advisor with regard to the United States\nfederal income tax treatment of an investment\nin the debt securities. Please consult your\nown tax advisor concerning the consequences of\nowning these securities in your particular\ncircumstances under the Code and the laws of\nany other taxing jurisdiction. 108\n\nTaxation of Debt Securities This subsection\ndescribes the material United States federal\nincome tax consequences of owning, selling and\ndisposing of the debt securities we are\noffering, other than the debt securities\ndescribed below under \u0093\u0097 United States Holders\n\u0097 Indexed and Other Debt Securities\u0094 and other\nthan debt securities issued as part of a unit,\nwhich will be described in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. It deals only with debt\nsecurities that are due to mature 30 years or\nless from the date on which they are issued.\nThe United States federal income tax\nconsequences of owning debt securities that\nare due to mature more than 30 years from\ntheir date of issue will be discussed in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. The tax\nconsequences of any particular debt security\nwill depend on its terms, and any particular\noffering of debt securities may have features\nor terms that cause the United States federal\nincome tax treatment of the debt securities to\ndiffer materially from the discussion below.\nAn applicable prospectus supplement will\ndiscuss any material differences from the\ndiscussion below. United States Holders This\nsubsection describes the tax consequences to a\nUnited States holder. You are a United States\nholder if you are a beneficial owner of a debt\nsecurity and you are, for United States\nfederal income tax purposes:\n                                              \n      a citizen or resident of the United     \n      States;                                 \n                                              \n                               \n      a domestic corporation;  \n                               \n                                              \n      an estate whose income is subject to    \n      United States federal income tax        \n      regardless of its source; or            \n                                              \n                                              \n      a trust if a United States court can    \n      exercise primary supervision over the   \n      trust\u0092s administration and one or more   \n      United States persons are authorized    \n      to control all substantial decisions    \n      of the trust.                           \n                                              \nIf you are not a United States holder, this\nsubsection does not apply to you and you\nshould refer to \u0093\u0097 Non-UnitedStates Holders\u0094\nbelow. Payments of Interest General Except as\ndescribed below in the case of interest on an\noriginal issue discount debt security that is\nnot qualified stated interest, each as defined\nbelow under \u0093\u0097 United States Holders \u0097\nOriginal Issue Discount \u0097 General\u0094, you will\nbe taxed on any interest on your debt\nsecurity, whether payable in U.S. dollars or a\nnon-U.S.dollar currency, including a composite\ncurrency or basket of currencies other than\nU.S. dollars, as ordinary income at the time\nyou receive the interest or when it accrues,\ndepending on your method of accounting for tax\npurposes. Non-U.S.Dollar Currency Debt\nSecurity \u0097 Cash Basis Taxpayers If you are a\ntaxpayer that uses the cash receipts and\ndisbursements method of accounting for tax\npurposes and you receive an interest payment\nthat is denominated in, or determined by\nreference to, a non-U.S.dollar currency, you\nmust recognize income equal to the U.S. dollar\nvalue of the interest payment, based on the\nexchange rate in effect on the date of\nreceipt, regardless of whether you actually\nconvert the payment into U.S. dollars. 109\n\nNon-U.S.Dollar Currency Debt Security \u0097\nAccrual Basis Taxpayers\n\nIf you are a taxpayer that uses an accrual\nmethod of accounting for tax purposes, you may\ndetermine the amount of income that you\nrecognize\nwith respect to an interest payment\ndenominated in, or determined by reference to,\na non-U.S. dollar currency by using one of two\nmethods. Under the first method, you will\ndetermine the amount of income\naccrued based on the average exchange rate in\neffect during the interest accrual period or,\nwith respect to an accrual period that spans\ntwo taxable years, that part of the period\nwithin the taxable year.\n\nIf you elect the second method, you would\ndetermine the amount of income accrued on the\nbasis of the exchange rate in effect on the\nlast day of the\naccrual period, or, in the case of an accrual\nperiod that spans two taxable years, the\nexchange rate in effect on the last day of the\npart of the period within the taxable year.\nAdditionally, under this second method, if you\nreceive a payment of\ninterest within five business days of the last\nday of your accrual period or taxable year,\nyou may instead translate the interest accrued\ninto U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in\neffect on the day that you actually receive\nthe interest payment. If\nyou elect the second method, it will apply to\nall debt instruments that you hold at the\nbeginning of the first taxable year to which\nthe election applies and to all debt\ninstruments that you subsequently acquire. You\nmay not revoke this election\nwithout the consent of the United States\nInternal Revenue Service.\n\nWhen you actually receive an interest payment,\nincluding a payment attributable\nto accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale\nor retirement of your debt security,\ndenominated in, or determined by reference to,\na non-U.S. dollar currency for which you\naccrued an amount of income, you will\nrecognize ordinary income or loss measured by\nthe difference, if any, between the exchange\nrate that you used to accrue interest income\nand the exchange rate in effect on the date of\nreceipt, regardless of whether you actually\nconvert the payment\ninto U.S. dollars.\n\nOriginal Issue Discount\n\nGeneral\n\nIf you own a debt security, other than a\nshort-term debt security with a term of one\nyear or less, it will be treated as an\noriginal issue\ndiscount debt security if the amount by which\nthe debt security\u0092s stated redemption price at\nmaturity exceeds its issue price is more than\na de minimis amount. Generally, a debt\nsecurity\u0092s issue price will be the first price\nat which a\nsubstantial amount of debt securities included\nin the issue of which the debt security is a\npart is sold to persons other than bond\nhouses, brokers, or similar persons or\norganizations acting in the capacity of\nunderwriters, placement agents, or\nwholesalers. A debt security\u0092s stated\nredemption price at maturity is the total of\nall payments provided by the debt security\nthat are not payments of qualified stated\ninterest. Generally, an interest payment on a\ndebt security is qualified\nstated interest if it is one of a series of\nstated interest payments on a debt security\nthat are unconditionally payable at least\nannually at a single fixed rate, with certain\nexceptions for lower rates paid during some\nperiods, applied to the\noutstanding principal amount of the debt\nsecurity. There are special rules for variable\nrate debt securities that are discussed below\nunder \u0093\u0097 Variable Rate Debt Securities\u0094.\n\nIn general, your debt security is not an\noriginal issue discount debt security if the\namount by which its stated redemption price at\nmaturity exceeds\nits issue price is less than the de minimis\namount of 0.25 percent of its stated\nredemption price at maturity multiplied by the\nnumber of complete years to its maturity. Your\ndebt security will have de minimis original\nissue discount if the\namount of the excess is less than the de\nminimis amount. If your debt security has de\nminimis original issue discount, you must\ninclude the de minimis amount in income as\nstated principal payments are made on the debt\nsecurity, unless you make the\nelection described below under \u0093\u0097 Election to\nTreat All Interest as Original Issue\n\n110\n\nDiscount\u0094. You can determine the includible\namount with respect to each such payment by\nmultiplying the total amount of your debt\nsecurity\u0092s de minimis original issue discount\nby a fraction equal to:\n                                              \n      the amount of the principal payment     \n      made                                    \n                                              \ndivided by:\n                                              \n      the stated principal amount of the      \n      debt security.                          \n                                              \nGenerally, if your original issue discount\ndebt security matures more than one year from\nits date of issue, you must include original\nissue discount in income before you receive\ncash attributable to that income. The amount\nof original issue discount that you must\ninclude in income is calculated using a\nconstant-yield method, and generally you will\ninclude increasingly greater amounts of\noriginal issue discount in income over the\nlife of your debt security. More specifically,\nyou can calculate the amount of original issue\ndiscount that you must include in income by\nadding the daily portions of original issue\ndiscount with respect to your original issue\ndiscount debt security for each day during the\ntaxable year or portion of the taxable year\nthat you hold your original issue discount\ndebt security. You can determine the daily\nportion by allocating to each day in any\naccrual period a pro rata portion of the\noriginal issue discount allocable to that\naccrual period. You may select an accrual\nperiod of any length with respect to your\noriginal issue discount debt security and you\nmay vary the length of each accrual period\nover the term of your original issue discount\ndebt security. However, no accrual period may\nbe longer than one year and each scheduled\npayment of interest or principal on the\noriginal issue discount debt security must\noccur on either the first or final day of an\naccrual period. You can determine the amount\nof original issue discount allocable to an\naccrual period by:\n                                              \n      multiplying your original issue         \n      discount debt security\u0092s adjusted issue  \n      price at the beginning of the accrual   \n      period                                  \n      by your debt security\u0092s yield to         \n      maturity; and then                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      subtracting from this figure the sum    \n      of the payments of qualified stated     \n      interest on your debt security          \n      allocable to the                        \n      accrual period.                         \n                                              \nYou must determine the original issue discount\ndebt security\u0092s yield to maturity on the basis\nof compounding at the close of each accrual\nperiod and adjusting for the length of each\naccrual period. Further, you determine your\noriginal issue discount debt security\u0092s\nadjusted issue price at the beginning of any\naccrual period by:\n                                              \n      adding your original issue discount     \n      debt security\u0092s issue price and any      \n      accrued original issue discount for     \n      each prior                              \n      accrual period; and then                \n                                              \n                                              \n      subtracting any payments previously     \n      made on your original issue discount    \n      debt security that were not qualified   \n      stated                                  \n      interest payments.                      \n                                              \nIf an interval between payments of qualified\nstated interest on your original issue\ndiscount debt security contains more than one\naccrual period, then, when you determine the\namount of original issue discount allocable to\nan accrual period, you must allocate the\namount of qualified stated interest payable at\nthe end of the interval, including any\nqualified stated interest that is payable on\nthe first day of the accrual period\nimmediately following the interval, pro rata\nto each accrual period in the interval based\non their relative lengths. In addition, you\nmust increase the adjusted issue price at the\nbeginning of each accrual period in the\ninterval by the amount of any qualified stated\ninterest that has accrued prior to the first\nday of the accrual period but that is not\npayable until the end of the interval. You may\ncompute the amount of original issue discount\nallocable to an initial short accrual period\nby using any reasonable method if all other\naccrual periods, other than a final short\naccrual period, are of equal length. 111\n\nThe amount of original issue discount\nallocable to the final accrual period is equal\nto the difference between:\n                                              \n      the amount payable at the maturity of   \n      your debt security, other than any      \n      payment of qualified stated interest;   \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      your debt security\u0092s adjusted issue      \n      price as of the beginning of the final  \n      accrual period.                         \n                                              \nAcquisition Premium If you purchase your debt\nsecurity for an amount that is less than or\nequal to the sum of all amounts, other than\nqualified stated interest, payable on your\ndebt security after the purchase date but is\ngreater than the amount of your debt\nsecurity\u0092s adjusted issue price, as determined\nabove under \u0093\u0097 General\u0094, the excess is\nacquisition premium.

Debt Securities\nSubject to Contingencies Including Optional\nRedemption Your debt security is subject to a\ncontingency if it provides for an alternative\npayment schedule or schedules applicable upon\nthe occurrence of a contingency or\ncontingencies, other than a remote or\nincidental contingency, whether such\ncontingency relates to payments of interest or\nof principal. In such a case, you must\ndetermine the yield and maturity of your debt\nsecurity by assuming that the payments will be\nmade according to the payment schedule most\nlikely to occur if:\n                                              \n      the timing and amounts of the payments  \n      that comprise each payment schedule     \n      are known as of the issue date; and     \n                                              \n                                              \n      one of such schedules is significantly  \n      more likely than not to occur.          \n                                              \nIf there is no single payment schedule that is\nsignificantly more likely than not to occur,\nother than because of a mandatory sinking\nfund, you must include income on your debt\nsecurity in accordance with the general rules\nthat govern contingent payment debt\ninstruments. These rules will be discussed in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement. 112\n\nNotwithstanding the general rules for\ndetermining yield and maturity, if your debt\nsecurity is subject to contingencies, and\neither you or we have an unconditional option\nor options that, if exercised, would require\npayments to be made on the debt security under\nan alternative payment schedule or schedules,\nthen:\n                                              \n      in the case of an option or options     \n      that we may exercise, we will be        \n      deemed to exercise or not exercise an   \n      option or                               \n      combination of options in the manner    \n      that minimizes the yield on your debt   \n      security; and                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      in the case of an option or options     \n      that you may exercise, you will be      \n      deemed to exercise or not exercise an   \n      option or                               \n      combination of options in the manner    \n      that maximizes the yield on your debt   \n      security.                               \n                                              \nIf both you and we hold options described in\nthe preceding sentence, those rules will apply\nto each option in the order in which they may\nbe exercised. You would determine the yield on\nyour debt security for the purposes of those\ncalculations by using any date on which your\ndebt security may be redeemed or repurchased\nas the maturity date and the amount payable on\nsuch date in accordance with the terms of your\ndebt security as the principal amount payable\nat maturity. If a contingency, including the\nexercise of an option, actually occurs or does\nnot occur contrary to an assumption made\naccording to the above rules then, except to\nthe extent that a portion of your debt\nsecurity is repaid as a result of this change\nin circumstances and solely to determine the\namount and accrual of original issue discount,\nyou must redetermine the yield and maturity of\nyour debt security by treating your debt\nsecurity as having been retired and reissued\non the date of the change in circumstances for\nan amount equal to your debt security\u0092s\nadjusted issue price on that date. Election to\nTreat All Interest as Original Issue Discount\nYou may elect to include in gross income all\ninterest that accrues on your debt security\nusing the constant-yield method described\nabove under \u0093\u0097 General\u0094, with the\nmodifications described below.

If your variable rate\ndebt security does not provide for stated\ninterest at a single qualified floating rate\nor a single objective rate, and also does not\nprovide for interest payable at a fixed rate\nother than a single fixed rate for an initial\nperiod of one year or less meeting one of the\ntwo requirements described above, you\ngenerally must determine the interest and\noriginal issue discount accruals on your debt\nsecurity by:\n                                              \n      determining a fixed rate substitute     \n      for each variable rate provided under   \n      your variable rate debt security;       \n                                              \n                                              \n      constructing the equivalent fixed rate  \n      debt instrument, using the fixed rate   \n      substitute described above;             \n                                              \n                                              \n      determining the amount of qualified     \n      stated interest and original issue      \n      discount with respect to the            \n      equivalent fixed rate                   \n      debt instrument; and                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      adjusting for actual variable rates     \n      during the applicable accrual period.   \n                                              \nWhen you determine the fixed rate substitute\nfor each variable rate provided under the\nvariable rate debt security, you generally\nwill use the value of each variable rate as of\nthe issue date or, for an objective rate that\nis not a qualified inverse floating rate, a\nrate that reflects the reasonably expected\nyield on your debt security. If your variable\nrate debt security provides for stated\ninterest either at one or more qualified\nfloating rates or at a qualified inverse\nfloating rate, and also provides for stated\ninterest at a single fixed rate other than at\na single fixed rate for an initial period of\none year or less meeting one of the two\nrequirements described above, you generally\nmust determine interest and original issue\ndiscount accruals by using the method\ndescribed in the previous paragraph. However,\nyour variable rate debt security will be\ntreated, for purposes of the first three steps\nof the determination, as if your debt security\nhad provided for a qualified floating rate, or\na qualified inverse floating rate, rather than\nthe fixed rate. The qualified floating rate,\nor qualified inverse floating rate, that\nreplaces the fixed rate must be such that the\nfair market value of your variable rate debt\nsecurity as of the issue date approximates 115\n\nthe fair market value of an otherwise\nidentical debt instrument that provides for\nthe qualified floating rate, or qualified\ninverse floating rate, rather than the fixed\nrate.\n\nShort-Term Debt Securities\n\nIn general, if you are an\nindividual or other cash basis United States\nholder of a debt security with a fixed\nmaturity of one year or less, a short- term\ndebt security, you are not required to accrue\noriginal issue discount, as specially defined\nbelow for the purposes of\nthis paragraph, for United States federal\nincome tax purposes unless you elect to do so\n(although it is possible that you may be\nrequired to include any stated interest in\nincome as you receive it). If you are an\naccrual basis taxpayer, a taxpayer\nin a special class, including, but not limited\nto, a regulated investment company, common\ntrust fund, or a certain type of pass-through\nentity, or a cash basis taxpayer who so\nelects, you will be required to accrue\noriginal issue discount on\nshort-term debt securities on either a\nstraight-line basis or under the constant-\nyield method, based on daily compounding. If\nyou are not required and do not elect to\ninclude original issue discount in income\ncurrently, any gain you realize on the\nsale or retirement of your short- term debt\nsecurity will be ordinary income to the extent\nof the accrued original issue discount, which\nwill be determined on a straight-line basis\nunless you make an election to accrue the\noriginal issue discount\nunder the constant-yield method, through the\ndate of sale or retirement. However, if you\nare not required and do not elect to accrue\noriginal issue discount on your short-term\ndebt securities, you will be required to defer\ndeductions for interest on\nborrowings allocable to your short-term debt\nsecurities in an amount not exceeding the\ndeferred income until the deferred income is\nrealized.\n\nWhen\nyou determine the amount of original issue\ndiscount subject to these rules, you must\ninclude all interest payments on your short-\nterm debt security, including stated interest,\nin your short-term debt security\u0092s stated\nredemption price at\nmaturity.\n\nNon-U.S.Dollar Currency Original Issue\nDiscount Debt Securities\n\nIf your original issue discount debt security\nis denominated in, or determined by reference\nto, a non-U.S. dollar\ncurrency, you must determine original issue\ndiscount for any accrual period on your\noriginal issue discount debt security in the\nnon-U.S. dollar currency and then translate\nthe amount of original issue\ndiscount into U.S. dollars in the same manner\nas stated interest accrued by an accrual basis\nUnited States holder, as described above under\n\u0093\u0097 Taxation of Debt Securities \u0097 United States\nHolders \u0097 Payments of Interest\u0094. You\nmay recognize ordinary income or loss when you\nreceive an amount attributable to original\nissue discount in connection with a payment of\ninterest or the sale or retirement of your\ndebt security.\n\nMarket Discount\n\nYou will be treated as if you\npurchased your debt security, other than a\nshort-term debt security, at a market\ndiscount, and your debt security will be a\nmarket discount debt security if the\ndifference between the debt security\u0092s stated\nredemption price at maturity or, in\nthe case of an original issue discount debt\nsecurity, the debt security\u0092s revised issue\nprice, and the price you paid for your debt\nsecurity is equal to or greater than 0.25\npercent of your debt security\u0092s stated\nredemption price at\nmaturity multiplied by the number of complete\nyears to the debt security\u0092s maturity. To\ndetermine the revised issue price of your debt\nsecurity for these purposes, you generally add\nany original issue discount that has accrued\non your debt\nsecurity to its issue price.\n\nIf your debt security\u0092s stated redemption\nprice at maturity or, in the case of a\ndiscount debt security, its\nrevised issue price, exceeds the price you\npaid for the debt security by less than 0.25\npercent of the debt security\u0092s stated\nredemption price at maturity multiplied by the\nnumber of complete years to the debt\nsecurity\u0092s maturity, the\nexcess constitutes de minimis market discount,\nand the rules discussed below are not\napplicable to you.\n\n116\n\nYou must treat any gain you recognize on the\nmaturity or disposition of your market\ndiscount debt security as ordinary income to\nthe extent of the accrued market discount on\nyour debt security. Alternatively, you may\nelect to include market discount in income\ncurrently over the life of your debt security.\nIf you make this election, it will apply to\nall debt instruments with market discount that\nyou acquire on or after the first day of the\nfirst taxable year to which the election\napplies. You may not revoke this election\nwithout the consent of the United States\nInternal Revenue Service. If you own a market\ndiscount debt security and do not make this\nelection, you will generally be required to\ndefer deductions for interest on borrowings\nallocable to your debt security in an amount\nnot exceeding the accrued market discount on\nyour debt security until the maturity or\ndisposition of your debt security. If you own\na market discount debt security, the market\ndiscount would accrue on a straight-line basis\nunless an election is made to accrue market\ndiscount using a constant-yield method. If you\nmake this election, it will apply only to the\ndebt security with respect to which it is made\nand you may not revoke it. You will, however,\nnot include accrued market discount in income\nunless you elect to do so as described above.\nDebt Securities Purchased at a Premium If you\npurchase your debt security for an amount in\nexcess of its principal amount (or, in the\ncase of an original issue discount debt\nsecurity, in excess of the sum of all amounts\npayable on the debt security after the\nacquisition date (other than payments of\nqualified stated interest)), you may elect to\ntreat the excess as amortizable bond premium.\nIf you make this election, you will reduce the\namount required to be included in your income\neach accrual period with respect to interest\non your debt security by the amount of\namortizable bond premium allocable to that\naccrual period, based on your debt security\u0092s\nyield to maturity. If the amortizable bond\npremium allocable to an accrual period exceeds\nyour interest income from the debt securities\nfor such accrual period, such excess is first\nallowed as a deduction to the extent of\ninterest included in your income in respect of\nthe debt securities in previous accrual\nperiods and is then carried forward to your\nnext accrual period. If the amortizable bond\npremium allocable and carried forward to the\naccrual period in which the debt securities\nare sold, retired or otherwise disposed of\nexceeds your interest income for such accrual\nperiod, you would be allowed an ordinary\ndeduction equal to such excess. If your debt\nsecurity is denominated in, or determined by\nreference to, a non-U.S.dollar currency, you\nwill compute your amortizable bond premium in\nunits of the non-U.S.dollar currency and your\namortizable bond premium will reduce your\ninterest income in units of the non-U.S.dollar\ncurrency. Gain or loss recognized that is\nattributable to changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates between the time your amortized\nbond premium offsets interest income and the\ntime of the acquisition of your debt security\nis generally taxable as ordinary income or\nloss. If you make an election to amortize bond\npremium, it will apply to all debt\ninstruments, other than debt instruments the\ninterest on which is excludible from gross\nincome, that you hold at the beginning of the\nfirst taxable year to which the election\napplies or that you thereafter acquire, and\nyou may not revoke it without the consent of\nthe United States Internal Revenue Service.\nSee also \u0093\u0097 Taxation of Debt Securities \u0097\nUnited States Holders \u0097 Original Issue\nDiscount \u0097 Election to Treat All Interest as\nOriginal Issue Discount\u0094. Purchase, Sale and\nRetirement of the Debt Securities Your tax\nbasis in your debt security will generally be\nthe U.S. dollar cost, as defined below, of\nyour debt security, adjusted by:\n                                              \n      adding any original issue discount,     \n      market discount, de minimis original    \n      issue discount and de minimis market    \n      discount                                \n      previously included in income with      \n      respect to your debt security; and      \n      then                                    \n                                              \n117\n                                              \n      subtracting any payments on your debt   \n      security that are not qualified stated  \n      interest payments and any amortizable   \n      bond                                    \n      premium to the extent that such         \n      premium either reduced interest income  \n      on your debt security or gave rise to   \n      a deduction on your debt security.      \n                                              \nIf you purchase your debt security with\nnon-U.S.dollar currency, the U.S. dollar cost\nof your debt security will generally be the\nU.S. dollar value of the purchase price on the\ndate of purchase. However, if you are a cash\nbasis taxpayer, or an accrual basis taxpayer\nif you so elect, and your debt security is\ntraded on an established securities market, as\ndefined in the applicable U.S. Treasury\nregulations, the U.S. dollar cost of your debt\nsecurity will be the U.S. dollar value of the\npurchase price on the settlement date of your\npurchase. You will generally recognize gain or\nloss on the sale or retirement of your debt\nsecurity equal to the difference between the\namount you realize on the sale or retirement,\nexcluding any amounts attributable to accrued\nbut unpaid interest (which will be treated as\ninterest payments), and your tax basis in your\ndebt security. If your debt security is sold\nor retired for an amount in non-U.S.dollar\ncurrency, the amount you realize will be the\nU.S. dollar value of such amount on the date\nthe note is disposed of or retired, except\nthat in the case of a note that is traded on\nan established securities market, as defined\nin the applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, a\ncash basis taxpayer, or an accrual basis\ntaxpayer that so elects, will determine the\namount realized based on the U.S. dollar value\nof the specified currency on the settlement\ndate of the sale. You will recognize capital\ngain or loss when you sell or retire your debt\nsecurity, except to the extent:\n                                              \n      described above under \u0093\u0097 Taxation of      \n      Debt Securities \u0097 United States Holders  \n      \u0097 Short-Term Debt                        \n      Securities\u0094 or \u0093\u0097 Market Discount\u0094; or      \n                                              \n                                              \n      attributable to changes in exchange     \n      rates as described below.               \n                                              \nCapital gain of a non-corporateUnited States\nholder is generally taxed at preferential\nrates where the property is held for more than\none year. You must treat any portion of the\ngain or loss that you recognize on the sale or\nretirement of a debt security as ordinary\nincome or loss to the extent attributable to\nchanges in exchange rates. However, you take\nexchange gain or loss into account only to the\nextent of the total gain or loss you realize\non the transaction. Exchange of Amounts in\nOther Than U.S. Dollars If you receive\nnon-U.S.dollar currency as interest on your\ndebt security or on the sale or retirement of\nyour debt security, your tax basis in the\nnon-U.S.dollar currency will equal its U.S.\ndollar value when the interest is received or\nat the time of the sale or retirement. If you\npurchase non-U.S.dollar currency, you\ngenerally will have a tax basis equal to the\nU.S. dollar value of the non-U.S.dollar\ncurrency on the date of your purchase. If you\nsell or dispose of a non-U.S.dollar currency,\nincluding if you use it to purchase debt\nsecurities or exchange it for U.S. dollars,\nany gain or loss recognized generally will be\nordinary income or loss. Indexed and Other\nDebt Securities The applicable prospectus\nsupplement will discuss the material United\nStates federal income tax rules with respect\nto contingent non-U.S.dollar currency debt\nsecurities, indexed debt securities (as\ndescribed above under \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities We May Offer \u0097 Indexed Debt\nSecurities\u0094), debt securities that are subject\nto the rules governing contingent payment debt\ninstruments, renewable 118\n\nor extendible debt securities and any debt\nsecurities providing for the periodic payment\nof principal over the life of the debt\nsecurity. Non-UnitedStates Holders This\nsubsection describes the tax consequences to a\nNon-UnitedStates holder. You are a Non-\nUnitedStates holder if you are the beneficial\nowner of a debt security and are, for United\nStates federal income tax purposes:\n                                       \n      a nonresident alien individual;  \n                                       \n                                 \n      a foreign corporation; or  \n                                 \n                                              \n      an estate or trust that in either case  \n      is not subject to United States         \n      federal income tax on a net income      \n      basis on income                         \n      or gain from a debt security.           \n                                              \nIf you are a United States holder, this\nsubsection does not apply to you. This\ndiscussion assumes that the debt security is\nnot subject to the rules of Section\n871(h)(4)(A) of the Code, relating to interest\npayments that are determined by reference to\nthe income, profits, changes in the value of\nproperty or other attributes of the debtor or\na related party. If this assumption is\nincorrect with respect to a particular debt\nsecurity, the applicable prospectus supplement\nwill discuss the material United States\nfederal income tax consequences to a Non-\nUnitedStates holder that holds such a debt\nsecurity.

Under these\nregulations, if the debt securities are\ndenominated in a foreign currency, a United\nStates holder (or a Non-United States holder\nthat holds the debt securities\nin connection with a U.S. trade or business)\nthat recognizes a loss with respect to the\ndebt securities that is characterized as an\nordinary loss due to changes in currency\nexchange rates (under any of the rules\ndiscussed above) would be required to\nreport the loss on Internal Revenue Service\nForm 8886 (Reportable Transaction Statement)\nif the loss exceeds the thresholds set forth\nin the regulations. For individuals and\ntrusts, this loss threshold is $50,000 in any\nsingle taxable year. For\nother types of taxpayers and other types of\nlosses, the thresholds are higher. You should\nconsult with your tax advisor regarding any\ntax filing and reporting obligations that may\napply in connection with acquiring, owning and\ndisposing of debt\nsecurities.\n\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\n\nUnited States Holders\n\nIn general, if you are a\nnoncorporate United States holder, we and\nother payors are required to report to the\nUnited States Internal Revenue Service all\npayments of principal, any premium and\ninterest on your debt security, and the\naccrual of original issue discount on an\noriginal issue discount debt security. In\naddition, we and other payors are required to\nreport to the United States Internal Revenue\nService any payment of proceeds of the sale of\nyour debt security before maturity within the\nUnited States.\nAdditionally, backup withholding will apply to\nany payments, including payments of original\nissue discount, if you fail to provide an\naccurate taxpayer identification number, or\n(in the case of interest payments) you are\nnotified by the United\nStates Internal Revenue Service that you have\nfailed to report all interest and dividends\nrequired to be shown on your federal income\ntax returns.\n\nYou generally may obtain a refund of any\namounts withheld under the U.S. backup\nwithholding rules that exceed your income tax\nliability by filing a\nrefund claim with the United States Internal\nRevenue Service.\n\nNon-UnitedStates Holders\n\nIn general, if you are a Non-United States\nholder, payments of principal, premium or\ninterest, including original\nissue discount, made by us and other payors to\nyou will not be subject to backup withholding\nand information reporting, provided that the\ncertification requirements described above\nunder \u0093\u0097 Taxation of Debt Securities \u0097 Non-\nUnited States Holders\u0094 are satisfied or you\notherwise establish an exemption. However, we\nand other payors are required to report\npayments of interest on your debt securities,\nincluding original issue\ndiscount, on Internal Revenue Service Form\n1042-S even if the payments are not otherwise\nsubject to information reporting requirements.\nIn addition, payment of the proceeds from the\nsale of debt securities\neffected at a United States office of a broker\nwill not be subject to backup withholding and\ninformation reporting if you have furnished to\nthe payor or broker an appropriate IRS Form\nW-8, an acceptable\nsubstitute form or other documentation upon\nwhich it may rely to treat the payment as made\nto a non-United States person.\n\nIn general, payment of the proceeds from the\nsale of debt securities effected at a foreign\noffice of a broker will not be subject to\ninformation\nreporting or backup withholding. However, a\nsale effected at a foreign office of a broker\ncould be subject to information reporting in\nthe same manner as a sale within the United\nStates (and in certain cases may be subject to\nbackup withholding as\nwell) if (i) the broker has certain\nconnections to the United States, (ii) the\nproceeds or confirmation are sent to the\nUnited States or (iii) the sale has certain\nother specified connections with the United\nStates.\n\n121\n\nYou generally may obtain a refund of any\namounts withheld under the backup withholding\nrules that\nexceed your income tax liability by filing a\nrefund claim with the Internal Revenue\nService.\n\nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)\nWithholding\n\nA U.S. law enacted in 2010 (commonly known as\n\u0093FATCA\u0094) could impose a withholding tax of 30%\non interest income\n(including original issue discount) and other\nperiodic payments on debt securities paid to\nyou or any non-U.S. person or entity that\nreceives such income (a\n\u0093non-U.S. payee\u0094) on your behalf, unless you\nand each such non-U.S. payee in the payment\nchain comply with the applicable information\nreporting, account\nidentification, withholding, certification and\nother FATCA-related requirements. In the case\nof a payee that is a non-U.S. financial\ninstitution (for example, a clearing system,\ncustodian, nominee or broker),\nwithholding generally will not be imposed if\nthe financial institution complies with the\nrequirements imposed by FATCA to collect and\nreport (to the U.S. or another relevant taxing\nauthority) substantial information regarding\nsuch institution\u0092s\nU.S. account holders (which would include some\naccount holders that are non-U.S. entities but\nhave U.S. owners). Other payees, including\nindividuals, may be required to provide proof\nof tax residence or\nwaivers of confidentiality laws and/or, in the\ncase of non-U.S. entities, certification or\ninformation relating to their U.S. ownership.\n\nWithholding may be imposed at any point in a\nchain of payments if the payee is not\ncompliant. A chain may work as follows, for\nexample: The payment is\ntransferred through a paying agent to a\nclearing system, the clearing system makes a\npayment to each of the clearing system\u0092s\nparticipants, and finally the clearing system\nparticipant makes a payment to a\nnon-U.S. bank or broker through which you hold\nthe debt securities, who credits the payment\nto your account. Accordingly, if you receive\npayments through a chain that includes one or\nmore non-U.S. payees, such as a non-U.S. bank\nor broker, the payment could be subject to\nwithholding if, for example, your non-U.S.\nbank or\nbroker through which you hold the debt\nsecurities fails to comply with the FATCA\nrequirements and is subject to withholding.\nThis would be the case even if you would not\notherwise have been directly subject to\nwithholding.\n\nA number of countries have entered into, and\nother countries are expected to enter into,\nagreements with the U.S. to facilitate the\ntype of information\nreporting required under FATCA. While the\nexistence of such agreements will not\neliminate the risk that debt securities will\nbe subject to the withholding described above,\nthese agreements are expected to reduce the\nrisk of the withholding for\ninvestors in (or investors that indirectly\nhold debt securities through financial\ninstitutions in) those countries.\n\nThe withholding tax described\nabove could apply to all interest, including\noriginal issue discount, and other periodic\npayments on the debt securities. We will not\npay any additional amounts in respect of this\nwithholding tax, so if this withholding\napplies, you will receive\nless than the amount that you would have\notherwise received.\n\nDepending on your circumstances, you may be\nentitled to a refund or credit in respect\nof some or all of this withholding. However,\neven if you are entitled to have any such\nwithholding refunded, the required procedures\ncould be cumbersome and significantly delay\nyour receipt of any withheld amounts. You\nshould consult your own tax\nadvisors regarding FATCA. You should also\nconsult your bank or broker through which you\nwould hold the debt securities about the\nlikelihood that payments to it (for credit to\nyou) may become subject to withholding in the\npayment chain.\n\nIn addition, your debt securities may also be\nsubject to other U.S. withholding tax as\ndescribed herein.\n\n122\n\nTaxation of Warrants This subsection describes\nthe material United States federal income tax\nconsequences of owning, selling and disposing\nof the warrants. It deals only with U.S.\ndollar denominated warrants to acquire or sell\nequity securities of issuers that are\nclassified as corporations for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes (or indices consisting\nsolely of such equity securities) and which\nare settled in cash (\u0093cash-settled warrants\u0094).\nIn addition, the following discussion only\ndeals with cash-settled warrants that are not\nlisted on a securities exchange. The following\ndiscussion also assumes that the issuer of the\nunderlying equity securities to which the\ncash-settled warrants relate (including any\nissuers of equity securities included in an\nindex to which the cash-settled warrants\nrelate) is neither a passive foreign\ninvestment company (as defined in Section 1297\nof the Code) nor a United States real property\nholding corporation (as defined in Section 897\nof the Code). The United States federal income\ntax consequences of warrants other than cash-\nsettled warrants and warrants issued as part\nof a unit will be discussed in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. The tax consequences of\nany particular warrant will depend on its\nterms, and any particular offering of warrants\nmay have features or terms that cause the\nUnited States federal income tax treatment of\nthe warrants to differ materially from the\ndiscussion below. An applicable prospectus\nsupplement will discuss any material\ndifferences from the discussion below. United\nStates Holders This subsection describes the\ntax consequences to a United States holder.\nYou are a United States holder if you are a\nbeneficial owner of a warrant and you are, for\nUnited States federal income tax purposes:\n                                              \n      a citizen or resident of the United     \n      States;                                 \n                                              \n                               \n      a domestic corporation;  \n                               \n                                              \n      an estate whose income is subject to    \n      United States federal income tax        \n      regardless of its source; or            \n                                              \n                                              \n      a trust if a United States court can    \n      exercise primary supervision over the   \n      trust\u0092s administration and one or more   \n      United States persons are authorized    \n      to control all substantial decisions    \n      of the trust.                           \n                                              \nIf you are not a United States holder, this\nsubsection does not apply to you and you\nshould refer to \u0093\u0097 Non-UnitedStates Holders\u0094\nbelow. Tax Treatment Under current law, a\ncash-settled warrant should be treated as a\ncash-settled option for United States federal\nincome tax purposes. The following discussion\nassumes that a cash-settled warrant will be\ntreated as a cash-settled option for United\nStates federal income tax purposes. Assuming\nthat the treatment of a cash-settled warrant\nas a cash-settled option for United States\nfederal income tax purposes is respected, a\nUnited States holder should not be required to\nrecognize taxable income over the term of the\ncash-settled warrant prior to settlement of\nthe cash-settled warrant, other than pursuant\nto a sale or exchange of the cash-settled\nwarrant prior to settlement. A United States\nholder\u0092s tax basis in a cash-settled warrant\nshould equal the amount paid by the United\nStates holder to acquire the cash-settled\nwarrant. 123\n\nUpon a sale or exchange of a cash-settled\nwarrant, or upon a lapse or cash settlement of\na cash-settled warrant, a United States holder\nshould recognize capital gain or loss in an\namount equal to the difference between the\namount realized, if any, upon the sale,\nexchange, lapse or cash settlement of the\ncash-settled warrant and the United States\nholder\u0092s tax basis in the cash-settled warrant\nsold, exchanged, lapsed or cash settled. Any\ngain or loss recognized upon such sale,\nexchange, lapse or cash settlement should be\nshort-term capital gain or loss if the United\nStates holder has held the cash-settled\nwarrant for one year or less and should be\nlong-term capital gain or loss if the United\nStates holder has held the cash-settled\nwarrant for more than one year. Short-term\ncapital gains are generally subject to tax at\nthe marginal tax rates applicable to ordinary\nincome. Backup Withholding and Information\nReporting Backup withholding may apply in\nrespect of payments on the cash-settled\nwarrants and the payment of proceeds from a\nsale or other disposition of the cash-settled\nwarrants, unless a United States holder\nprovides proof of an applicable exemption or\ncorrect taxpayer identification number and\notherwise complies with the applicable\nrequirements of the backup withholding rules.\nThe amounts withheld under the backup\nwithholding rules are not an additional tax\nand may be refunded or credited against the\nUnited States holder\u0092s United States federal\nincome tax liability, provided that the\nrequired information is timely provided to the\nInternal Revenue Service. In addition,\ninformation reports may be filed with the\nInternal Revenue Service in connection with\npayments on the cash-settled warrants and the\npayment of gross proceeds from a sale or other\ndisposition of cash-settled warrants, unless\nthe United States holder provides proof of an\napplicable exemption from the information\nreporting rules. Non-UnitedStates Holders This\nsection only applies to a Non-UnitedStates\nholder. A holder is a Non-UnitedStates holder\nif such holder is a beneficial owner of a\ncash-settled warrant and is, for United States\nfederal income tax purposes:\n                                       \n      a nonresident alien individual;  \n                                       \n                                 \n      a foreign corporation; or  \n                                 \n                                              \n      an estate or trust that in either case  \n      is not subject to United States         \n      federal income tax on a net income      \n      basis on income                         \n      or gain from the cash-settled           \n      warrants.                               \n                                              \nThe term \u0093Non-United States holder\u0094 does not\ninclude any of the following holders:\n                                              \n      an individual present in the United     \n      States for 183 days or more in the      \n      taxable year payments are received and  \n      who is not                              \n      otherwise a resident of the United      \n      States for U.S. federal income tax      \n      purposes;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      certain former citizens or residents    \n      of the United States; or                \n                                              \n                                              \n      a holder for whom income or gain in     \n      respect of the cash-settled warrants    \n      is effectively connected with the       \n      conduct of a                            \n      trade or business in the United         \n      States.                                 \n                                              \nA Non-UnitedStates holder should not be\nsubject to United States federal income tax or\nwithholding tax in respect of amounts paid to\nthe Non-UnitedStates holder. A Non-\nUnitedStates holder may be subject to\ngenerally applicable information reporting and\nbackup withholding requirements as discussed\nabove under \u0093United States Taxation \u0097 Taxation\nof Debt Securities \u0097 Backup Withholding and\nInformation Reporting \u0097 Non-UnitedStates\nHolders\u0094 with respect to payments on the cash-\nsettled warrants at maturity as well as in\nconnection with the proceeds from a sale,\nexchange or other disposition of the cash-\nsettled warrants, unless the 124\n\nNon-United States holder complies with the\nrequirements necessary to avoid backup\nwithholding (in which case such\nNon-United States holder will not be subject\nto such backup withholding) as set forth under\n\u0093United States Taxation \u0097 Taxation of Debt\nSecurities \u0097\nNon-United States Holders\u0094 above.\n\nIn addition, the Treasury Department has\nissued regulations under\nwhich amounts paid or deemed paid on certain\nfinancial instruments (\u0093871(m) financial\ninstruments\u0094) that are treated as attributable\nto U.S.-source dividends could be treated, in\nwhole or in part depending on the\ncircumstances, as a\n\u0093dividend equivalent\u0094 payment that is subject\nto tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under\nan applicable treaty), which in the case of\nany amounts a Non-United States holder\nreceives upon the sale,\nexchange, lapse or cash settlement of the\ncash-settled warrants, could be collected via\nwithholding. If these regulations were to\napply to the cash-settled warrants, we may be\nrequired to withhold such taxes if any\nU.S.-source dividends are paid\nwith respect to the warrant property during\nthe term of the cash-settled warrants. We\ncould also require a Non-United States holder\nto make certifications (e.g., an applicable\nInternal Revenue Service Form W-8) in order to\navoid or minimize withholding obligations, and\nwe could withhold accordingly (subject to a\nNon-United States holder\u0092s potential right to\nclaim a refund\nfrom the Internal Revenue Service) if such\ncertifications were not received or were not\nsatisfactory. If withholding was required, we\nwould not be required to pay any additional\namounts with respect to amounts so withheld.\nThese regulations\ngenerally will apply to 871(m) financial\ninstruments (or a combination of financial\ninstruments treated as having been entered\ninto in connection with each other) issued (or\nsignificantly modified and treated as retired\nand reissued) on or after\nJanuary 1, 2023, but will also apply to\ncertain 871(m) financial instruments (or a\ncombination of financial instruments treated\nas having been entered into in connection with\neach other) that have a delta (as defined in\nthe applicable Treasury\nregulations) of one and are issued (or\nsignificantly modified and treated as retired\nand reissued) on or after January 1, 2017. In\naddition, these regulations will not apply to\nfinancial instruments that reference a\n\u0093qualified index\u0094\n(as defined in the regulations). Unless\notherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, the cash-settled\nwarrants will not be subject to withholding\nunder these rules. The remainder of this\ndiscussion assumes that the cash-settled\nwarrants will not be subject to withholding\nunder these rules. In certain limited\ncircumstances, however, a Non-United States\nholder should be aware that it is possible for\nNon-United States holders to be liable for tax\nunder these rules with respect to a\ncombination of transactions treated as having\nbeen entered into in connection with each\nother even when no withholding is\nrequired. A Non-United States holder should\nconsult their tax advisor concerning these\nregulations, subsequent official guidance and\nregarding any other possible alternative\ncharacterizations of the\ncash-settled warrants for United States\nfederal income tax purposes.\n\nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)\nWithholding\n\nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)\nwithholding (as described above under \u0093United\nStates Taxation \u0097 Taxation of Debt Securities\n\u0097\nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)\nWithholding\u0094) should not apply to the cash-\nsettled warrants.\n\n125\n\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION Initial Offering and Sale\nof Securities We may sell the securities from\ntime to time in their initial offering as\nfollows:\n                       \n      through agents;  \n                       \n                                              \n      to dealers or underwriters for resale;  \n                                              \n                                  \n      directly to purchasers; or  \n                                  \n                                              \n      through a combination of any of these   \n      methods of sale.                        \n                                              \nIn some cases, we or dealers acting with us or\non our behalf may also purchase securities and\nreoffer them to the public by one or more of\nthe methods described above. This prospectus\nmay be used in connection with any offering of\nour securities through any of these methods or\nother methods described in the applicable\nprospectus supplement.

We may also\ndesignate agents from\ntime to time to\nsolicit offers to\npurchase securities\nfrom the public on our\nbehalf. If required,\nthe prospectus\nsupplement relating to\nany particular\noffering of securities\nwill name any agents\ndesignated to solicit\noffers, and will\ninclude information\nabout any commissions\nwe may pay the agents,\nin that offering.\nAgents may be deemed\nto be \u0093underwriters\u0094\nas that term is\ndefined in the\nSecurities Act. From\ntime to time, we may\nsell securities to one\nor more dealers acting\nas principals. The\ndealers, who may be\ndeemed to be\n\u0093underwriters\u0094 as that\nterm is defined in the\nSecurities Act, may\nthen resell those\nsecurities to the\npublic. We may sell\nsecurities from time\nto time to one or more\nunderwriters, who\nwould purchase the\nsecurities as\nprincipal for resale\nto the public, either\non a firm-commitment\nor best-efforts basis.\nIf we sell securities\nto underwriters, we\nmay execute an\nunderwriting agreement\nwith them at the time\nof sale and will name\nthem in the applicable\nprospectus supplement.\nIn connection with\nthose sales,\nunderwriters may be\ndeemed to have\nreceived compensation\nfrom us in the form of\nunderwriting discounts\nor commissions and may\nalso receive\ncommissions from\npurchasers of the\nsecurities for whom\nthey may act as\nagents. Underwriters\nmay resell the\nsecurities to or\nthrough dealers, and\nthose dealers may\nreceive compensation\nin the form of\ndiscounts, concessions\nor commissions from\nthe underwriters\nand/or commissions\nfrom purchasers for\nwhom they may act as\nagents. The applicable\nprospectus supplement\nwill include any\nrequired information\nabout underwriting\ncompensation we pay to\nunderwriters, and any\ndiscounts, concessions\nor commissions\nunderwriters allow to\nparticipating dealers,\nin connection with an\noffering of\nsecurities. We may\nauthorize\nunderwriters, dealers\nand agents to solicit\nfrom third parties\noffers to purchase\nsecurities under\ncontracts providing\nfor payment and\ndelivery on future\ndates. The applicable\n126\n\nprospectus supplement\nwill describe the\nmaterial terms of\nthese contracts,\nincluding any\nconditions to the\npurchasers\u0092\nobligations, and will\ninclude any required\ninformation about\ncommissions we may pay\nfor soliciting these\ncontracts.\n\nUnderwriters, dealers,\nagents and other\npersons may be\nentitled, under\nagreements that they\nmay enter into with\nus, to indemnification\nby us or The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc., as\napplicable, against\ncertain liabilities,\nincluding liabilities\nunder the Securities\nAct.\n\nIn connection with an\noffering, the\nunderwriters may\npurchase and sell\nsecurities in the open\nmarket. These\ntransactions may\ninclude short sales,\nstabilizing\ntransactions and\npurchases to cover\npositions created by\nshort sales. Short\nsales involve the sale\nby the underwriters of\na greater number of\nsecurities than they\nare required to\npurchase in an\noffering. Stabilizing\ntransactions consist\nof certain bids or\npurchases made for the\npurpose of preventing\nor retarding a decline\nin the market price of\nthe securities while\nan offering is in\nprogress.\n\nThe underwriters also\nmay impose a penalty\nbid. This occurs when\na particular\nunderwriter repays to\nthe underwriters a\nportion of the\nunderwriting\ndiscount received by\nit because the\nunderwriters have\nrepurchased securities\nsold by or for the\naccount of that\nunderwriter in\nstabilizing or short-\ncovering transactions.\n\nThese activities by\nthe underwriters may\nstabilize, maintain or\notherwise affect the\nmarket price of the\nsecurities. As a\nresult, the price of\nthe\nsecurities may be\nhigher than the price\nthat otherwise might\nexist in the open\nmarket. If these\nactivities are\ncommenced, they may be\ndiscontinued by the\nunderwriters at any\ntime. These\ntransactions may be\neffected on an\nexchange or automated\nquotation system, if\nthe securities are\nlisted on that\nexchange or admitted\nfor trading on that\nautomated quotation\nsystem, or in the\nover-the-counter\nmarket or\notherwise.\n\nThe underwriters,\ndealers and agents, as\nwell as their\nassociates, may be\ncustomers of or\nlenders to, and may\nengage in transactions\nwith and perform\nservices for us, The\nGoldman Sachs Group,\nInc. and our or its\nsubsidiaries in the\nordinary course of\nbusiness.

Founded in 1869, the Firm is\nheadquartered in New York and maintains\noffices in all major financial centers around\nthe world. The Firm\u0092s principal executive\noffices are located at 200 West Street, New\nYork, New York 10282, telephone (212)\n902-1000. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a\nbank holding company and a\nfinancial holding company regulated by the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (the \u0093Federal Reserve Board\u0094). The\nFirm\u0092s U.S. depository institution subsidiary,\nGoldman Sachs Bank USA, is a New York State-\nchartered bank.\n\nWE ARE A HOLDING COMPANY\n\nBecause our assets consist principally of\ninterests in the subsidiaries through which we\nconduct our businesses, our right to\nparticipate as an equity\nholder in any distribution of assets of any of\nour subsidiaries upon the subsidiary\u0092s\nliquidation or otherwise, and thus the ability\nof our security holders to benefit from the\ndistribution, is junior to the rights of\ncreditors of the\nsubsidiary, except to the extent that any\nclaims we may have as a creditor of the\nsubsidiary are recognized. In addition,\ndividends, loans and advances to us from some\nof our subsidiaries, including Goldman Sachs &\nCo. LLC\n(\u0093GS&Co.\u0094), are restricted by net capital\nrequirements under the Exchange Act and under\nrules of securities exchanges and other\nregulatory bodies. Dividends, loans and\nadvances to us from our banking subsidiaries,\nincluding GS Bank,\nare subject to regulatory restrictions under\napplicable federal and state banking laws and\nregulations. Furthermore, because some of our\nsubsidiaries, including from time to time some\nof our principal operating subsidiaries, are\npartnerships in\nwhich we are a general\n\n3\n\npartner or the sole limited partner, we may be\nliable for their obligations. We also\nguarantee many of the obligations of our\nsubsidiaries. Any liability we may have for\nour subsidiaries\u0092\nobligations could reduce our assets that are\navailable to satisfy our direct creditors,\nincluding investors in our securities.\n\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\n\nWe will receive no proceeds or any other\ncompensation from any person in connection\nwith the issuance of our guarantee.\n\nWe were advised by GS Bank that it intends to\nuse the net proceeds from the sales of the\nspecified CDs in order to provide additional\nfunds for its\noperations and for other general corporate\npurposes.\n\nTHE SPECIFIED CDS\n\nEach specified CD will have such terms,\nincluding as to maturity, interest (if any)\nand other features, and will be offered and\nsold in such amount and\nupon such terms and conditions, as may be\ndetermined by GS Bank and described in a\nseparate disclosure document or confirmation\nof sale prepared by GS Bank at or before the\ntime of issue. In general, the specified CDs\nwill represent deposit\nliabilities of GS Bank and will be insured by\nthe FDIC to the extent provided by applicable\nlaw. However, the specific terms of the\nspecified CDs, and of any FDIC insurance, may\nvary and you should read the applicable\ndisclosure document or\nconfirmation of sale for a description of the\nactual terms of any specified CD and of its\noffering and sale. The brief references to the\nspecified CDs in this prospectus are qualified\nin their entirety by reference to the\napplicable disclosure\ndocument or confirmation of sale, and if there\nis any inconsistency between this prospectus\nand the applicable disclosure document or\nconfirmation of sale with regard to the\ndescription of any specified CD, the latter\nshall control.\n\nThe specified CDs will be offered and sold\nwithout registration under the Securities Act\nof 1933 (the \u0093Securities Act\u0094) and will not\nhave the\nprotection of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.\n\nOUR GUARANTEE AND THE GUARANTEE AGREEMENT\n\nUnder the guarantee agreement, we\nunconditionally and, subject to the provisions\nthereof, irrevocably guarantee to each person\n(a \u0093Party\u0094) to\nwhom GS Bank may owe any Obligations (as\ndescribed below) from time to time, the\ncomplete payment when due, whether by\nacceleration or otherwise, of all payment\nobligations, whether now in existence or\nhereafter arising (other than non-recourse\npayment obligations), of GS Bank, including\nall payment obligations (other than non-\nrecourse payment obligations) in connection\nwith any deposit, loan or other\ninstrument specified in the guarantee\nagreement (collectively, the \u0093Obligations\u0094),\nprovided, however,that, with respect to any\nParty, \u0093Obligations\u0094 does not include any\npayment obligations, whether now in existence\nor\nhereafter arising, of GS Bank arising under or\nin connection with any certificate of deposit\nof GS Bank unless the confirmation of sale of\nsuch certificate of deposit, the disclosure\nstatement or any other offering document\nrelating to such\ncertificate of deposit, the instrument\ngoverning such certificate of deposit\n(including any master certificate of deposit),\nor the books and records of GS Bank or its\naffiliates expressly states that the\nobligations of GS Bank under such certificate\nof deposit will be entitled to the benefit of\nthe guarantee.\n\n4\n\nConsequently, if the confirmation of sale of a\ncertificate of deposit, the disclosure\nstatement or any other offering document\nrelating to a certificate of deposit, the\ninstrument governing a certificate of deposit\n(including any master certificate of deposit),\nor the books and records of GS Bank or its\naffiliates does notexpressly state that such\ncertificate of deposit is entitled to the\nbenefit of the guarantee, your certificate of\ndeposit is not a specified CD and is not\ncovered by our guarantee or the guarantee\nagreement, or by this prospectus or the\nregistration statement of which it forms a\npart. The guarantee agreement provides that we\nmay amend or terminate the guarantee agreement\nas to one Party, all Parties or a group of\nspecified Parties, and as to one Obligation,\nall Obligations or specified Obligations\n(including in each case with respect to the\nspecified CDs), at any time if:\n                                              \n      we issue a press release reported by    \n      the Dow Jones News Service, the         \n      Associated Press or a comparable        \n      national news                           \n      service;                                \n                                              \n                                              \n      we file an amended guarantee agreement  \n      or notice of termination on a current   \n      or periodic report under the Exchange   \n      Act; or                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      we provide a written notice signed by   \n      us,                                     \n                                              \nin each case stating\nthat we are so\namending or\nterminating the\nguarantee agreement.\nAny such termination\nor amendment will be\neffective with respect\nto a Party on the\nopening of business on\nthe fifth New York\nbusiness day after the\nearliest of the\nissuance of such press\nrelease, the filing of\nsuch current or\nperiodic report or the\nreceipt of such\nwritten notice, as\napplicable. However,\nno such amendment or\ntermination may\nadversely affect the\nrights of any Party\nrelating to any\nObligations incurred\nprior to the\neffectiveness of such\namendment or\ntermination. Any such\namendment or\ntermination may become\neffective as to one\nParty whether or not\nit becomes effective\nas to another Party.\nOur guarantee of the\nspecified CDs is\nsubject to these\ntermination and\namendment provisions.\nThe guarantee\nagreement further\nprovides that we will\nnot be liable to any\nParty for any amount\nin excess of the\namount which GS Bank\nactually owes to such\nParty, and that we may\nassert any defense to\npayment available to\nGS Bank, other than\nthose arising in a\nbankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding.\nUpon payment of any\nObligations owing to\nany Party, we will be\nsubrogated to the\nrights of such Party\nagainst GS Bank to the\nextent of such\npayment, but we will\nnot exercise those\nrights with respect to\nany Party until all\ndue and unpaid\nObligations to that\nParty have been paid\nin full. Once we may\nexercise those rights,\nsuch Party will be\nobligated to take at\nour expense such steps\nas we may reasonably\nrequest to implement\nsuch subrogation. We\nmay not assign our\nrights or delegate our\nobligations under the\nguarantee agreement\nwith respect to any\nParty, in whole or in\npart, without the\nprior written consent\nof such Party.\nHowever, this\nprohibition on\nassignment or\ndelegation is subject\nto exceptions. We may\n(i) assign and\ndelegate all of our\nrights and obligations\nunder the guarantee\nagreement to any\npartnership,\ncorporation, trust or\nother organization in\nany form that succeeds\nto all or\nsubstantially all of\nour assets and\nbusiness and assumes\nsuch obligations by\ncontract, operation of\nlaw or otherwise; or\n(ii) transfer our\nguarantee or any of\nour interests or\nobligations in or\nunder our guarantee to\nanother entity as\ntransferee as part of\nour resolution,\nrestructuring or\nreorganization upon or\nfollowing our becoming\nsubject to a\nreceivership,\ninsolvency,\nliquidation,\nresolution or similar\nproceeding. Upon any\nsuch delegation and\nassumption, or\ntransfer, of\nobligations, we will\nbe relieved of and\nfully discharged from\nall obligations under\nthe guarantee\nagreement, whether\nsuch obligations arose\nbefore or after such\ndelegation and\nassumption, or\ntransfer. For the\npurposes of the\nguarantee agreement,\nreferences above to\n\u0093GS Bank\u0094 include any\nbanking subsidiary of\nours (whether now or\nhereafter formed) that\nsucceeds to the\nbusiness of GS Bank.\nUnder the guarantee\nagreement, therefore,\n\u0093Obligations\u0094 include\nthe Obligations of any\nsuch successor. 5\n\nThe guarantee\nagreement is governed\nby New York law.\n\nIn the event The\nGoldman Sachs Group,\nInc. becomes subject\nto a proceeding under\nthe Federal Deposit\nInsurance Act or Title\nII of the Dodd-Frank\nWall\nStreet Reform and\nConsumer Protection\nAct (together, the\n\u0093U.S. Special\nResolution Regimes\u0094),\nthe transfer of our\nguarantee, and any\ninterest and\nobligation in or under\nour guarantee, from\nThe Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. will be\neffective to\nthe extent provided\nunder such U.S.\nSpecial Resolution\nRegime. In the event\nGS Bank or The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc., or\nany of our affiliates,\nbecomes subject to a\nU.S. Special\nResolution Regime,\ndefault rights against\nGS Bank or The Goldman\nSachs\nGroup, Inc. with\nrespect to our\nguarantee are\npermitted to be\nexercised to no\ngreater extent than\npermitted under such\nU.S. Special\nResolution Regime.\n\nThe guarantee\nagreement has not been\nand will not be\nqualified as an\nindenture, and there\nis not and will not be\nany trustee, qualified\nunder the Trust\nIndenture Act with\nrespect to the\nguarantee agreement or\nour guarantee of the\nspecified CDs.\nTherefore, the\nbeneficiaries of our\nguarantee of the\nspecified CDs will not\nhave the protection of\nthe Trust Indenture\nAct with respect to\nour guarantee.\n\nOur guarantee of the\nspecified CDs is\ngoverned by and\nsubject to the\nguarantee agreement,\nand any payments we\nmay become obligated\nto make in\nrespect of our\nguarantee will be made\non the terms and as\nprovided in the\nguarantee agreement.\nPlease note that we or\nour agent may require\nany person claiming\npayment under our\nguarantee to provide\nevidence reasonably\nsatisfactory to us or\nour\nagent that such person\nis a Party entitled to\nsuch payment under the\nguarantee agreement.\nWe have filed the\nguarantee agreement\nwith the SEC as\nexhibit 4.1 to our\nCurrent Report on Form\n8-K, dated\nSeptember 28, 2018,\nand we encourage you\nto read it carefully.\n\nTo the extent any\nobligations thereunder\nremain outstanding,\nwithout prejudice\nto the rights of any\nParty with respect to\nobligations incurred\nprior to the\neffectiveness of the\nguarantee agreement,\nthe guarantee\nagreement amends,\nrestates and\nsupersedes our prior\ngeneral guarantee\nagreements relating to\nthe Obligations,\nexcept\nthat clause (ii) of\nthe sixth paragraph of\nthis section and the\nninth paragraph of\nthis section shall not\napply to Obligations\nguaranteed under any\nsuch prior general\nguarantee agreement.\n\nBecause we are a\nholding company, our\nability to perform our\nobligations under our\nguarantee will depend\nin part on our ability\nto participate in\ndistributions of\nassets from our\nsubsidiaries. We\ndiscuss these matters\nunder \u0093We Are a\nHolding Company\u0094\nabove.\n\nConsiderations\nRelating to the\nGuarantee of the\nSpecified CDs\n\nIn the event of a\nliquidation or other\nresolution of GS Bank\nand payment on the\nspecified CDs by the\nFDIC\nunder FDIC insurance,\nthe FDIC will be\nsubrogated to all\nrights of holders of\nthe specified CDs\nagainst GS Bank under\nthe specified CDs,\nincluding their rights\nagainst The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc.\nunder the guarantee\nagreement, to the\nextent of\nsuch payment.\n\nThe specified CDs will\nbe deposit liabilities\nof GS Bank,\nunconditionally and\nirrevocably guaranteed\nby The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc.\npursuant to our\nguarantee. Except to\nthe extent FDIC\ninsurance is available\nfrom the FDIC, no\nentity other than GS\nBank or The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. will\nhave any obligation,\ncontingent or\notherwise, to make any\npayments in respect of\nthe\nspecified CDs.\nAccordingly, GS Bank\nand The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. will be\ndependent on their\nrespective assets and\nearnings to generate\nthe funds necessary to\nmeet their respective\nobligations with\nrespect to the\nspecified CDs. If GS\nBank\u0092s\nand The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc.\u0092s assets\nand earnings are not\nadequate, GS Bank and\nThe Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. may be\nunable to make\npayments in respect of\nthe specified CDs and\nyou could lose that\npart of your deposit,\nif any, that is not\ncovered by FDIC\ninsurance.\n\n6\n\nSCOPE OF THIS\nPROSPECTUS\n\nAs indicated above,\nthe guarantee\nagreement applies to a\nwide range of payment\nobligations of GS\nBank. This prospectus,\nhowever, relates only\nto our\nguarantee of the\nspecified CDs and not\nto any other\nobligations of GS\nBank, including any\nother obligations of\nGS Bank covered by the\nguarantee, unless we\namend or supplement\nthis prospectus to\nprovide otherwise.\n\nAs noted above, a\ncertificate of deposit\nis a \u0093specified CD\u0094\nonly if the\nconfirmation of sale\nof such certificate of\ndeposit, the\ndisclosure\nstatement or any other\noffering document\nrelating to such\ncertificate of\ndeposit, the\ninstrument governing\nsuch certificate of\ndeposit (including any\nmaster certificate of\ndeposit), or the books\nand records of GS Bank\nor its affiliates\nexpressly\nstates that the\nobligations of GS Bank\nunder such certificate\nof deposit will be\nentitled to the\nbenefit of the\nguarantee.\n\nWe reserve the right\nto\namend or terminate the\nguarantee agreement\nwith respect to the\nspecified CDs, in\nwhole or in any part\n(and with respect to\nsome or all holders of\nthe specified CDs), at\nany time in the future\nas permitted in the\nguarantee agreement.\nIn the event\nthat we terminate the\nguarantee agreement\nwith respect to any\nspecified CDs (or\nholders), this\nprospectus will not\napply with respect to\nany offers or sales of\nthose obligations made\nafter the termination\nbecomes effective\n(other than offers and\nsales to any holders\nas to whom the\ntermination is not\neffective). However,\nabsent effective\ntermination of the\nguarantee agreement\nwith respect to any\nspecified CDs (or any\nparticular holders),\nall offers and sales\nof those specified\nCDs, with our\nguarantee, (or all\noffers and sales to\nthose holders, as the\ncase may be) would be\ncovered by this\nprospectus and the\nregistration statement\nof which it forms a\npart.\n\nOTHER CERTIFICATES OF\nDEPOSIT\n\nUnless otherwise\nstated in an amendment\nor supplement to this\nprospectus, our\nguarantee will apply\nto the specified CDs\nof any banking\nsubsidiary of\nours (whether now or\nhereafter formed) that\nsucceeds to the\nbusiness of GS Bank.\nTherefore, unless\notherwise so stated,\nin this prospectus\nreferences to GS Bank\ninclude any such\nsuccessor and\nreferences to the\nspecified CDs and our\nguarantee thereof\ninclude, respectively,\nthe specified CDs of\nany such successor\n(whether issued before\nor after the\nsuccession) and our\nguarantee thereof\nunder the guarantee\nagreement.\n\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION\n\nInitial Offering and\nSale of Specified CDs\nand Guarantee\n\nWe have been advised\nby GS Bank that the\nspecified CDs,\ntogether with our\nguarantee, are being\noffered from time to\ntime by GS&Co. and may\nalso be\noffered by any of our\nother affiliates\npursuant to brokerage\nagreements signed with\nGS Bank from time to\ntime. GS&Co. and our\nother affiliates\ninvolved in the\ndistribution of the\nspecified CDs, and our\nguarantee, may be\ndeemed to be\n\u0093underwriters\u0094 as that\nterm is defined in the\nSecurities Act with\nrespect to our\nguarantee. We refer to\nGS&Co. and any such\nother affiliates as\nthe \u0093distributors\u0094 in\nthis prospectus.\n\nThe distributors may\noffer the specified\nCDs, with our\nguarantee, for sale at\nvarying prices,\nincluding prevailing\nmarket prices at the\ntime of sale or\nrelated or negotiated\nprices, or at fixed\nprices determined at\nthe time of sale,\neither directly or\nthrough other\ninstitutions acting as\nselling agents. The\ndistributors may offer\nthe specified CDs as\nagents for GS Bank and\nwill be compensated by\nGS\nBank in the form of\nplacement fees,\ncommissions, purchase\nprice discounts or\nsimilar arrangements\nand may reallow or\notherwise pay some of\nthis compensation to\ntheir selling agents,\nif any. The specified\n\n7\n\nCDs will be offered\nfor sale primarily in\nthe United States but\nmay also be offered\noutside the United\nStates. The specified\nCDs are not required\nto be, and have not\nbeen, registered under\nthe\nSecurities Act. We\nhave been advised by\nGS Bank that GS Bank\nmay authorize the\ndistributors and their\nagents to solicit from\nthird parties offers\nto purchase the\nspecified CDs\nproviding for payment\nand issuance on future\ndates.\n\nWe have been advised\nby GS Bank that it may\nalso solicit offers to\npurchase the specified\nCDs directly from the\npublic from time to\ntime.\n\nWe do not expect to\npay any fees or other\ncompensation to any\ndistributor or selling\nagent in connection\nwith the offering of\nspecified CDs with our\nguarantee. In\naddition, we do not\nintend to charge any\nfees to or receive any\nother compensation\nfrom GS Bank or any\nother person in\nrespect of our\nguarantee.\n\nIn connection with an\noffering, the\ndistributors may\npurchase and sell\nspecified CDs,\ntogether with our\nguarantee, in the open\nmarket. These\ntransactions may\ninclude short sales,\nstabilizing\ntransactions and\npurchases to cover\npositions created by\nshort sales. Short\nsales involve the sale\nby the distributors of\na greater number of\nspecified CDs than\nthey are required to\npurchase in an\noffering. Stabilizing\ntransactions consist\nof certain bids or\npurchases made for the\npurpose of preventing\nor retarding a decline\nin the market price of\nthe specified CDs\nwhile an offering is\nin progress.\n\nThe distributors also\nmay impose a penalty\nbid. This occurs when\na particular\ndistributor repays to\nthe distributors a\nportion of the fees,\ncommissions\nor discounts received\nby it because the\ndistributors have\nrepurchased specified\nCDs, together with our\nguarantee, sold by or\nfor the account of\nthat distributor in\nstabilizing or short-\ncovering transactions.\n\nThese activities by\nthe distributors may\nstabilize, maintain or\notherwise affect the\nmarket price of the\nspecified CDs. As a\nresult, the price of\nthe\nspecified CDs may be\nhigher than the price\nthat otherwise might\nexist in the open\nmarket. If these\nactivities are\ncommenced, they may be\ndiscontinued by the\ndistributors at any\ntime.\n\nWe reserve the right\nto amend or supplement\nthis prospectus at any\ntime to reflect the\naddition of one or\nmore other financial\ninstitutions as\ndistributors. Any such\ndistributors and any\nselling agents, as\nwell as their\naffiliates, may be\ncustomers of or\nlenders to, and may\nengage in transactions\nwith and perform\nservices (including\ninvestment banking,\nfinancial advisory and\nbanking\nservices) for, The\nGoldman Sachs Group,\nInc. and its\nsubsidiaries in the\nordinary course of\nbusiness. In\nconnection with some\nof these transactions\nand services, these\nparties have in the\npast received, and may\nin the future receive,\ncustomary fees\nfrom us or our\naffiliates. As noted\nabove, GS Bank expects\nto offer the specified\nCDs, together with our\nguarantee, to or\nthrough our\naffiliates, as\ndistributors or\nselling agents. Among\nour affiliates, GS&Co.\nmay offer the\nspecified CDs, with\nour guarantee, for\nsale in the United\nStates and Goldman\nSachs International,\nGoldman Sachs (Asia)\nL.L.C. and Goldman\nSachs (Singapore) Pte.\nmay offer them for\nsale outside the\nUnited States. Our\naffiliates may also\noffer the specified\nCDs with our\nguarantee in other\nmarkets through one or\nmore selling agents,\nincluding one another.\n\nGS Bank has agreed (or\nwill agree) to\nindemnify the\ndistributors that have\nsigned (or will sign)\nbrokerage agreements\nagainst certain\nliabilities, which may\ninclude liabilities\narising under the\nSecurities Act.\n\n8\n\nMarket-Making Resales\nby Affiliates\n\nThis prospectus may be\nused by GS&Co. and any\nof our other\naffiliates in\nconnection with offers\nand sales of specified\nCDs, together with our\nguarantee, in market-\nmaking transactions.\nIn a market-making\ntransaction, GS&Co. or\nany such other\naffiliate may resell a\nspecified CD with our\nguarantee that it\nacquires from other\nholders, after the\noriginal offering and\nsale of the specified\nCD. Resales of this\nkind may occur in the\nopen market or may be\nprivately negotiated,\nat prevailing market\nprices at the time of\nresale or at related\nor negotiated prices.\nIn these transactions,\nGS&Co. or such other\naffiliate may act as\nprincipal or agent,\nincluding as agent for\nthe counterparty in a\ntransaction in which\nthe affiliate acts as\nprincipal, or as agent\nfor both\ncounterparties in a\ntransaction in which\nthe affiliate does not\nact as principal.\nGS&Co. or such other\naffiliate may receive\ncompensation in the\nform of fees,\ncommissions and\ndiscounts, including\nfrom both\ncounterparties in some\ncases. In addition to\nGS&Co., our other\naffiliates who engage\nin transactions of\nthis kind and may use\nthis prospectus\nfor this purpose\ninclude Goldman Sachs\nInternational, Goldman\nSachs (Asia) L.L.C.\nand Goldman Sachs\n(Singapore) Pte.\n\nIn the event that GS\nBank,\nGS&Co. or any other\naffiliate of GS Bank\npurchases specified\nCDs, with our\nguarantee, in the\nsecondary market,\nthese purchases may be\nsubject to certain\nregulatory conditions,\nincluding, if GS Bank,\nGS&Co. or any other\naffiliate of GS Bank\npurchases specified\nCDs from a holder\nwithin six days after\nthose specified CDs\nare initially issued,\ndownward adjustments\nto the purchase price\nto be paid to the\nholder to account for\nearly withdrawal\npenalties imposed by\nGS Bank pursuant to\nRegulation D of the\nFederal Reserve Board.\nThus, if you sell a\nspecified CD to GS\nBank or any of its\naffiliates shortly\nafter you purchase and\npay for it, you may\nreceive a reduced\nprice for your\nspecified CD.\n\nWe do not expect to\npay or receive any\nfees or other\ncompensation in\nrespect of our\nguarantee in market-\nmaking transactions.\nWe do not expect that\nGS&Co. or any of our\nother affiliates that\nengages in these\ntransactions will pay\nany proceeds from its\nmarket-making resales\nto us.\n\nIf you\npurchase any specified\nCDs with our guarantee\nfrom us or any of our\naffiliates, you may\nassume that you are\npurchasing them in a\nmarket-making\ntransaction, unless we\nor any of our\naffiliates (or any\nagent thereof) informs\nyou in your\nconfirmation of\nsale that the\nspecified CDs and\nguarantee are being\npurchased in their\noriginal offering and\nsale.\n\nMarket for the\nSpecified CDs\n\nThere is no\nestablished trading\nmarket for the\nspecified CDs,\ntogether with our\nguarantee, and there\nis no assurance that\nany will develop.\nNeither we\nnor GS Bank intends to\nlist the specified CDs\nor our guarantee on\nany securities\nexchange or trading\nfacility. We have been\nadvised by GS&Co. that\nit intends to make a\nmarket in the\nspecified CDs and it\nis possible that our\nother affiliates\ninvolved in the\ndistribution of the\nspecified CDs may also\ndo so. Neither GS&Co.\nnor any of our other\naffiliates, however,\nis obligated to do so\nand any one of them\nmay discontinue\nmarket-making at any\ntime without notice.\nNo assurance can be\ngiven as to the\nliquidity or the\ntrading market for the\nspecified CDs.\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nGS&Co. is an affiliate\nof The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. and, as\nsuch, will have a\n\u0093conflict of interest\u0094\nin any offering of the\nspecified\nCDs with our guarantee\nwithin the meaning of\nFINRA Rule 5121.\nConsequently, any\noffering of the\nspecified CDs with our\nguarantee will be\nconducted in\n\n9\n\ncompliance with the\nprovisions of Rule\n5121. GS&Co. will not\nbe permitted to sell\nspecified CDs with our\nguarantee in any\noffering to an account\nover which it\nexercises\ndiscretionary\nauthority without the\nprior specific written\napproval of the\naccount holder.\n\nEMPLOYEE RETIREMENT\nINCOME SECURITY ACT\n\nThis section is\nrelevant to you only\nif you are an\ninsurance company or\nthe fiduciary of a\npension plan or an\nemployee benefit plan\n(including a\ngovernmental plan, an\nIRA or a Keogh Plan)\nproposing to invest in\nthe specified CDs with\nour guarantee.\n\nThe U.S. Employee\nRetirement Income\nSecurity Act of 1974,\nas amended (\u0093ERISA\u0094),\nand the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986,\nas amended (the\n\u0093Code\u0094), prohibit\ncertain transactions\n(\u0093prohibited\ntransactions\u0094)\ninvolving the assets\nof an\nemployee benefit plan\nthat is subject to the\nfiduciary\nresponsibility\nprovisions of ERISA or\nSection 4975 of the\nCode (including\nindividual retirement\naccounts, Keogh plans\nand other plans\ndescribed in Section\n4975(e)(1) of the\nCode) (a\n\u0093Plan\u0094) and certain\npersons who are\n\u0093parties in interest\u0094\n(within the meaning of\nERISA) or\n\u0093disqualified persons\u0094\n(within the meaning of\nthe Code) with respect\nto the Plan;\ngovernmental plans may\nbe subject to similar\nprohibitions unless an\nexemption applies to\nthe transaction.

Founded in 1869,\nthe Firm is headquartered in New York and\nmaintains offices in all\nmajor financial centers around the world. The\nFirm\u0092s principal executive offices are located\nat 200 West Street, New York, New York 10282,\ntelephone (212) 902-1000. The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. is a bank\nholding company and a financial holding\ncompany regulated by the Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System (the \u0093Federal\nReserve Board\u0094). The Firm\u0092s U.S. depository\ninstitution subsidiary, Goldman Sachs Bank\nUSA, is a New York\nState-chartered bank.\n\nWE ARE A HOLDING COMPANY\n\nBecause our assets consist principally of\ninterests in the subsidiaries through which we\nconduct our businesses, our right to\nparticipate as an equity\nholder in any distribution of assets of any of\nour subsidiaries upon the subsidiary\u0092s\nliquidation or otherwise, and thus the ability\nof our security holders to benefit from the\ndistribution, is junior to the rights of\ncreditors of the\nsubsidiary, except to the extent that any\nclaims we may have as a creditor of the\nsubsidiary are recognized. In addition,\ndividends, loans and advances to us from some\nof our subsidiaries, including Goldman Sachs &\nCo. LLC\n(\u0093GS&Co.\u0094), are restricted by net capital\nrequirements under the Exchange Act and under\nrules of securities exchanges and other\nregulatory bodies. Dividends, loans and\nadvances to us from our banking subsidiaries,\nincluding GS Bank,\nare subject to regulatory restrictions under\napplicable federal\n\n3\n\nand state banking laws and regulations.\nFurthermore, because some of our subsidiaries,\nincluding from time to time some of our\nprincipal operating subsidiaries, are\npartnerships in which we are a\ngeneral partner or the sole limited partner,\nwe may be liable for their obligations. We\nalso guarantee many of the obligations of our\nsubsidiaries. Any liability we may have for\nour subsidiaries\u0092 obligations could reduce our\nassets that are\navailable to satisfy our direct creditors,\nincluding investors in our securities.\n\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\n\nWe will receive no proceeds or any other\ncompensation from any person in connection\nwith the issuance of our guarantee.\n\nWe were advised by GS Bank that it intends to\nuse the net proceeds from the sales of the\nnotes and deposit notes in order to provide\nadditional funds\nfor its operations and for other general\ncorporate purposes.\n\nTHE NOTES AND DEPOSIT NOTES\n\nThe notes and deposit notes will be issued by\nGS Bank under one or more fiscal agency\nagreements from time to time in the future.\nEach note or deposit\nnote will have such terms, including as to\nmaturity, interest (if any) and other\nfeatures, and will be offered and sold in such\namount and upon such terms and conditions, as\nmay be determined by GS Bank and described in\na separate offering circular\nprepared by GS Bank at or before the time of\nissue. In general, the deposit notes will\nrepresent deposit liabilities of GS Bank and\nwill be insured by the FDIC to the extent\nprovided by applicable law, and the notes will\nbe debt obligations of GS\nBank and will not be insured. However, the\nspecific terms of the notes and deposit notes,\nand of any FDIC insurance, may vary and you\nshould read the applicable offering circular\nfor a description of the actual terms of any\nnote or deposit note and\nof its offering and sale. The brief references\nto the notes and deposit notes in this\nprospectus are qualified in their entirety by\nreference to the applicable offering circular,\nand if there is any inconsistency between this\nprospectus and the\napplicable offering circular with regard to\nthe description of any note or deposit note,\nthe latter shall control.\n\nThe notes and deposit notes will\nbe offered and sold without registration under\nthe Securities Act of 1933 (the \u0093Securities\nAct\u0094), in reliance on the exemption in Section\n3(a)(2) of that Act, and will not have the\nprotection of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.\n\nOUR GUARANTEE AND THE GUARANTEE AGREEMENT\n\nUnder the guarantee agreement, we\nunconditionally and, subject to the provisions\nthereof, irrevocably guarantee to each person\n(a \u0093Party\u0094) to\nwhom GS Bank may owe any Obligations (as\ndescribed below) from time to time, the\ncomplete payment when due, whether by\nacceleration or otherwise, of all payment\nobligations, whether now in existence or\nhereafter arising (other than non-recourse\npayment obligations), of GS Bank, including\nall payment obligations (other than non-\nrecourse payment obligations) in connection\nwith any deposit, loan or other\ninstrument specified in the guarantee\nagreement (collectively, the \u0093Obligations\u0094),\nprovided, however,that, with respect to any\nParty, \u0093Obligations\u0094 does not include any\npayment obligations, whether now in existence\nor\nhereafter arising, of GS Bank arising under or\nin connection with any certificate of deposit\nof GS Bank unless the confirmation of sale of\nsuch certificate of deposit, the disclosure\nstatement or any other offering document\nrelating to such\ncertificate of deposit, the instrument\ngoverning such certificate of deposit\n(including any master certificate of deposit),\nor the books and records of GS Bank or its\naffiliates\n\n4\n\nexpressly states that the obligations of GS\nBank under such certificate of deposit will be\nentitled to the benefit of the guarantee. The\npayment obligations of GS Bank in connection\nwith the notes and the deposit notes are\nObligations under the guarantee agreement.\nThus, as and to the extent provided in the\nguarantee agreement, we guarantee to each\nParty the complete payment when due of all\npayment obligations of GS Bank in connection\nwith the notes and deposit notes. With respect\nto any note or deposit note, the Party\nentitled to the benefit of our guarantee of\nthat instrument will be the person entitled to\nreceive payment thereon, as provided in the\nterms of the instrument. Generally, the person\nentitled to receive payment will be the person\nin whose name the relevant note or deposit\nnote is registered on the books of GS Bank or\nits agent. In the case of any note or deposit\nnote issued in book-entry form, the registered\nowner will be the depository or its nominee.\nYou should read the applicable offering\ncircular for information about these matters.\nThe guarantee agreement provides that we may\namend or terminate the guarantee agreement as\nto one Party, all Parties or a group of\nspecified Parties, and as to one Obligation,\nall Obligations or specified Obligations\n(including in each case with respect to the\nnotes or deposit notes), at any time if:\n                                              \n      we issue a press release reported by    \n      the Dow Jones News Service, the         \n      Associated Press or a comparable        \n      national news                           \n      service;                                \n                                              \n                                              \n      we file an amended guarantee agreement  \n      or notice of termination on a current   \n      or periodic report under the Exchange   \n      Act; or                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      we provide a written notice signed by   \n      us,                                     \n                                              \nin each case stating that we are so amending\nor terminating the guarantee agreement. Any\nsuch termination or amendment will be\neffective with respect to a Party on the\nopening of business on the fifth New York\nbusiness day after the earliest of the\nissuance of such press release, the filing of\nsuch current or periodic report or the receipt\nof such written notice, as applicable.\nHowever, no such amendment or termination may\nadversely affect the rights of any Party\nrelating to any Obligations incurred prior to\nthe effectiveness of such amendment or\ntermination. Any such amendment or termination\nmay become effective as to one Party whether\nor not it becomes effective as to another\nParty. Our guarantee of the notes and deposit\nnotes is subject to these termination and\namendment provisions. The guarantee agreement\nfurther provides that we will not be liable to\nany Party for any amount in excess of the\namount which GS Bank actually owes to such\nParty, and that we may assert any defense to\npayment available to GS Bank, other than those\narising in a bankruptcy or insolvency\nproceeding. Upon payment of any Obligations\nowing to any Party, we will be subrogated to\nthe rights of such Party against GS Bank, to\nthe extent of such payment, but we will not\nexercise those rights with respect to any\nParty until all due and unpaid Obligations to\nthat Party have been paid in full. Once we may\nexercise those rights, such Party will be\nobligated to take at our expense such steps as\nwe may reasonably request to implement such\nsubrogation. We may not assign our rights or\ndelegate our obligations under the guarantee\nagreement with respect to any Party, in whole\nor in part, without the prior written consent\nof such Party. However, this prohibition on\nassignment or delegation is subject to\nexceptions. We may (i) assign and delegate all\nof our rights and obligations under the\nguarantee agreement to any partnership,\ncorporation, trust or other organization in\nany form that succeeds to all or substantially\nall of our assets and business and assumes\nsuch obligations by contract, operation of law\nor otherwise; or (ii) transfer our guarantee\nor any of our interests or obligations in or\nunder our guarantee to another entity as\ntransferee as part of 5\n\nour resolution, restructuring or\nreorganization upon or following our becoming\nsubject to a receivership, insolvency,\nliquidation, resolution or similar proceeding.\nUpon any such delegation and\nassumption, or transfer, of obligations, we\nwill be relieved of and fully discharged from\nall obligations under the guarantee agreement,\nwhether such obligations arose before or after\nsuch delegation and assumption, or transfer.\n\nFor the purposes of the guarantee agreement,\nreferences above to \u0093GS Bank\u0094 include any\nbanking subsidiary of ours (whether now or\nhereafter\nformed) that succeeds to the business of GS\nBank. Under the guarantee agreement,\ntherefore, \u0093Obligations\u0094 include the\nObligations of any such successor.\n\nThe guarantee agreement is governed by New\nYork law.\n\nIn the event The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nbecomes subject to a proceeding under the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act or Title II of\nthe Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act\n(together, the \u0093U.S. Special Resolution\nRegimes\u0094), the transfer of our guarantee, and\nany interest and obligation in or under our\nguarantee, from The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nwill be effective to\nthe extent provided under such U.S. Special\nResolution Regime. In the event GS Bank or The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., or any of our\naffiliates, becomes subject to a U.S. Special\nResolution Regime, default rights against GS\nBank or The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. with respect to our guarantee are\npermitted to be exercised to no greater extent\nthan permitted under such U.S. Special\nResolution Regime.\n\nThe guarantee agreement has not been and will\nnot be qualified as an indenture, and there is\nnot and will not be any trustee, qualified\nunder the Trust\nIndenture Act with respect to the guarantee\nagreement or our guarantee of the notes and\ndeposit notes. Therefore, the beneficiaries of\nour guarantee of the notes and deposit notes\nwill not have the protection of the Trust\nIndenture Act with respect\nto our guarantee.\n\nOur guarantee of the notes and deposit notes\nis governed by and subject to the guarantee\nagreement, and any payments we may\nbecome obligated to make in respect of our\nguarantee will be made on the terms and as\nprovided in the guarantee agreement. Please\nnote that we or our agent may require any\nperson claiming payment under our guarantee to\nprovide evidence reasonably\nsatisfactory to us or our agent that such\nperson is a Party entitled to such payment\nunder the guarantee agreement. We have filed\nthe guarantee agreement with the SEC as\nexhibit 4.1 to our Current Report on Form\n8-K, dated September 28, 2018, and we\nencourage you to read it carefully.\n\nTo the extent any\nobligations thereunder remain outstanding,\nwithout prejudice to the rights of any Party\nwith respect to obligations incurred prior to\nthe effectiveness of the guarantee agreement,\nthe guarantee agreement amends, restates and\nsupersedes our prior\ngeneral guarantee agreements relating to the\nObligations, except that clause (ii) of the\nsixth paragraph of this section and the ninth\nparagraph of this section shall not apply to\nObligations guaranteed under any such prior\ngeneral guarantee\nagreement.\n\nBecause we are a holding company, our ability\nto perform our obligations under our guarantee\nwill depend in part on our ability to\nparticipate in distributions of assets from\nour subsidiaries. We discuss these matters\nunder \u0093We Are a Holding Company\u0094 above.\n\nConsiderations Relating to the Guarantee of\nthe Deposit Notes\n\nIn the event of a liquidation or other\nresolution of GS Bank and payment on the\ndeposit notes\nby the FDIC under FDIC insurance, the FDIC\nwill be subrogated to all rights of holders of\nthe deposit\n\n6\n\nnotes against GS Bank under the deposit notes,\nincluding their rights against The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. under the guarantee\nagreement, to the extent of such payment.\n\nThe deposit notes will be deposit liabilities\nof GS Bank, unconditionally and irrevocably\nguaranteed by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\npursuant to our\nguarantee. Except to the extent FDIC insurance\nis available from the FDIC, no entity other\nthan GS Bank or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nwill have any obligation, contingent or\notherwise, to make any payments in respect of\nthe deposit notes.\nAccordingly, GS Bank and The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. will be dependent on their\nrespective assets and earnings to generate the\nfunds necessary to meet their respective\nobligations with respect to the deposit notes.\nIf GS Bank\u0092s and The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s assets and\nearnings are not adequate, GS Bank and The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. may be unable to\nmake payments in respect of the deposit notes\nand you could lose that part of your deposit,\nif any, that is not covered\nby FDIC insurance.\n\nConsiderations Relating to the Guarantee of\nthe Notes\n\nThe notes will be liabilities of GS Bank,\nunconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. pursuant to our\nguarantee. However,\nthe notes will be general unsecured\nobligations, notdeposit liabilities, of GS\nBank and will notbe insured by the FDIC. In\nthe event of a liquidation or other resolution\nof GS Bank, the notes, as general obligations\nof GS Bank, will\ngenerally be subordinated in right of payment\nto the claims of deposit holders. No entity\nother than GS Bank or The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. will have any obligation, contingent or\notherwise, to make any payments in respect of\nthe notes.\nAccordingly, GS Bank and The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. will be dependent on their\nrespective assets and earnings to generate the\nfunds necessary to meet their respective\nobligations with respect to the notes. If GS\nBank\u0092s and The Goldman Sachs\nGroup Inc.\u0092s assets and earnings are not\nadequate, GS Bank and The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. may be unable to make payments in respect\nof the notes and you could lose your entire\ninvestment in your note.\n\nSCOPE OF THIS PROSPECTUS\n\nAs indicated above, the guarantee agreement\napplies to a wide range of payment obligations\nof GS Bank. This prospectus, however, relates\nonly to our\nguarantee of the notes and deposit notes and\nnot to any other obligations of GS Bank,\nincluding any other obligations of GS Bank\ncovered by the guarantee, unless we amend or\nsupplement this prospectus to provide\notherwise.\n\nWe reserve the right to amend or terminate the\nguarantee agreement with respect to the notes\nor deposit notes, in whole or in any part (and\nwith respect\nto some or all holders of the notes or deposit\nnotes), at any time in the future as permitted\nin the guarantee agreement. In the event that\nwe terminate the guarantee agreement with\nrespect to any notes or deposit notes (or\nholders), this prospectus\nwill not apply with respect to any offers or\nsales of those obligations made after the\ntermination becomes effective (other than\noffers and sales to any holders as to whom the\ntermination is not effective).\n\n7\n\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION Initial Offering and Sale\nof Notes and Deposit Notes with Guarantee We\nhave been advised by GS Bank that the notes or\ndeposit notes, in each case together with our\nguarantee, may be initially offered from time\nto time as follows:\n                       \n      through agents;  \n                       \n                                              \n      to dealers or initial purchasers for    \n      resale;                                 \n                                              \n                                  \n      directly to purchasers; or  \n                                  \n                                              \n      through a combination of any of these   \n      methods of sale.                        \n                                              \nThe notes or deposit notes, in each case\ntogether with our guarantee, which GS Bank\ndistributes by any of these methods may be\nsold to the public, in one or more\ntransactions, either:\n                                              \n      at a fixed price or prices, which may   \n      be changed;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      at market prices prevailing at the      \n      time of sale;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      at prices related to prevailing market  \n      prices; or                              \n                                              \n                             \n      at negotiated prices.  \n                             \nThe notes or deposit\nnotes, in each case\ntogether with our\nguarantee, may be\noffered by GS&Co., any\nof our other\naffiliates or other\nfirms, pursuant to\ndistribution\nagreements signed with\nGS Bank and us from\ntime to time. We refer\nto these firms as\n\u0093agents\u0094. The notes\nand deposit notes will\nbe offered for sale\nprimarily in the\nUnited States but may\nalso be offered\noutside the United\nStates. The notes and\ndeposit notes are not\nrequired to be, and\nhave not been,\nregistered under the\nSecurities Act. The\nagents may offer the\nnotes or deposit\nnotes, in each case\ntogether with our\nguarantee, as agents\nfor GS Bank or may\npurchase them for\nresale as principal,\neither on a firm-\ncommitment or best-\nefforts basis, and\nwill be compensated by\nGS Bank in the form of\nplacement fees,\ncommissions, purchase\nprice discounts or\nsimilar arrangements.\nThe agents may offer\nthe notes or deposit\nnotes either directly\nor through other\ninstitutions acting as\nselling agents, and\nmay reallow or\notherwise pay all or\nsome of their\ncompensation to their\nselling agents, if\nany. We have been\nadvised by GS Bank\nthat it may also\nsolicit offers to\npurchase the notes or\ndeposit notes directly\nfrom the public from\ntime to time. We do\nnot expect to pay any\nfees or other\ncompensation to any\nagent in connection\nwith the offering of\nnotes or deposit notes\nwith our guarantee. In\naddition, we do not\nintend to charge any\nfees to or receive any\nother compensation\nfrom GS Bank or any\nother person in\nrespect of our\nguarantee. Neither the\nnotes nor the deposit\nnotes are required to\nbe or have been\nregistered under the\nSecurities Act.\nHowever, because our\nguarantee has been\nregistered under the\nSecurities Act, the\nagents may be deemed\nto be \u0093underwriters\u0094,\nand some of the\ncompensation they\nreceive in connection\nwith the distribution\nof notes and deposit\nnotes may be deemed to\nbe \u0093underwriters\u0092\ncompensation\u0094 (as\nthese terms are\ndefined in the\nSecurities Act), with\nrespect to our\nguarantee. In\nconnection with an\noffering, the agents\nmay purchase and sell\nnotes or deposit\nnotes, together with\nour guarantee, in the\nopen market. These\ntransactions may\ninclude short sales,\nstabilizing\ntransactions and\npurchases to cover\npositions created by\nshort sales. Short\nsales involve the sale\nby the agents of a\ngreater number of\nnotes or deposit notes\nthan they are required\nto purchase in an 8\n\noffering. Stabilizing\ntransactions consist\nof certain bids or\npurchases made for the\npurpose of preventing\nor retarding a decline\nin the market price of\nthe notes or deposit\nnotes while an\noffering is in\nprogress.\n\nThe agents also may\nimpose a penalty bid.\nThis occurs when a\nparticular agent\nrepays to the agents a\nportion of the fees,\ncommissions or\ndiscounts received by\nit because the agents\nhave repurchased notes\nor deposit notes,\ntogether with our\nguarantee, sold by or\nfor the account of\nthat agent in\nstabilizing or short-\ncovering transactions.\n\nThese activities by\nthe agents may\nstabilize, maintain or\notherwise affect the\nmarket price of the\nnotes or deposit\nnotes. As a result,\nthe price of the\nnotes or deposit notes\nmay be higher than the\nprice that otherwise\nmight exist in the\nopen market. If these\nactivities are\ncommenced, they may be\ndiscontinued by the\nagents at any time.\n\nWe have been advised\nby GS Bank that it may\nauthorize the agents\nand their selling\nagents to solicit from\nthird parties offers\nto purchase the notes\nor\ndeposit notes\nproviding for payment\nand issuance on future\ndates.\n\nThe agents, as well as\ntheir affiliates, may\nbe customers of or\nlenders to, and\nmay engage in\ntransactions with and\nperform services\n(including investment\nbanking, financial\nadvisory and banking\nservices) for, The\nGoldman Sachs Group,\nInc. and its\nsubsidiaries in the\nordinary course of\nbusiness. In\nconnection with some\nof these\ntransactions and\nservices, these\nparties have in the\npast received, and may\nin the future receive,\ncustomary fees from us\nor our affiliates. As\nnoted above, GS Bank\nexpects to offer the\nnotes and deposit\nnotes, together with\nour guarantee, to or\nthrough our\naffiliates, as agents\nor selling agents.\nAmong our affiliates,\nGS&Co. may offer the\nnotes and deposit\nnotes, with our\nguarantee, for sale in\nthe United States and\nGoldman Sachs\nInternational, Goldman\nSachs (Asia) L.L.C.\nand Goldman\nSachs (Singapore) Pte.\nmay offer them for\nsale outside the\nUnited States. Our\naffiliates may also\noffer the notes and\ndeposit notes in other\nmarkets through one or\nmore selling agents,\nincluding one another.\n\nWe and GS Bank have\nagreed (or will agree)\nto indemnify the\nagents that have\nsigned (or will sign)\ndistribution\nagreements against\ncertain liabilities,\nwhich may include\nliabilities arising\nunder the Securities\nAct.\n\nMarket-Making Resales\nby Affiliates\n\nThis prospectus may be\nused by GS&Co. and any\nof our other\naffiliates in\nconnection with offers\nand sales of notes and\ndeposit notes,\ntogether with\nour guarantee, in\nmarket-making\ntransactions. In a\nmarket-making\ntransaction, GS&Co. or\nany such other\naffiliate may resell a\nnote or deposit note\nthat it acquires from\nother holders, after\nthe original offering\nand sale of the note\nor deposit\nnote. Resales of this\nkind may occur in the\nopen market or may be\nprivately negotiated,\nat prevailing market\nprices at the time of\nresale or at related\nor negotiated prices.\nIn these transactions,\nGS&Co. or such other\naffiliate may act as\nprincipal or agent,\nincluding as agent for\nthe counterparty in a\ntransaction in which\nthe affiliate acts as\nprincipal, or as agent\nfor both\ncounterparties in a\ntransaction in which\nthe affiliate does not\nact as principal.\nGS&Co. or such other\naffiliate may receive\ncompensation in the\nform of fees,\ncommissions and\ndiscounts, including\nfrom both\ncounterparties in some\ncases. In addition to\nGS&Co., our other\naffiliates who engage\nin transactions of\nthis kind and may use\nthis prospectus\nfor this purpose\ninclude Goldman Sachs\nInternational, Goldman\nSachs (Asia) L.L.C.\nand Goldman Sachs\n(Singapore) Pte.\n\nIn the event that GS\nBank,\nGS&Co. or any other\naffiliate of GS Bank\npurchases deposit\nnotes with our\nguarantee in the\nsecondary market,\nthese purchases may be\nsubject to certain\nregulatory\n\n9\n\nconditions, including,\nif GS Bank, GS&Co. or\nany other affiliate of\nGS Bank purchases\ndeposit notes from a\nholder within six days\nafter those deposit\nnotes are initially\nissued, downward\nadjustments to the\npurchase price to be\npaid to the holder to\naccount for early\nwithdrawal penalties\nimposed by GS Bank\npursuant to Regulation\nD of the Federal\nReserve Board. Thus,\nif you sell a deposit\nnote to GS Bank or any\nof its affiliates\nshortly after you\npurchase and pay for\nit, you may receive a\nreduced price for your\ndeposit note.\n\nWe do not expect to\npay or receive any\nfees or\nother compensation in\nrespect of our\nguarantee in market-\nmaking transactions.\nWe do not expect that\nGS&Co. or any of our\nother affiliates that\nengages in these\ntransactions will pay\nany proceeds from its\nmarket-making resales\nto us.\n\nWhen you purchase any\nnotes or deposit notes\ntogether with our\nguarantee, you may\nassume that you are\npurchasing them in a\nmarket-making\ntransaction\nunless you are\ninformed in your\nconfirmation of sale\nthat you are\npurchasing them in\ntheir original\noffering and sale.\n\nMarket for the Notes\nand Deposit Notes\n\nThere is no\nestablished trading\nmarket for the notes\nor deposit notes, in\neach case together\nwith our guarantee,\nand there is no\nassurance that any\nwill\ndevelop. Neither we\nnor GS Bank intends to\nlist the notes,\ndeposit notes or our\nguarantee on any\nsecurities exchange or\ntrading facility. We\nhave been advised by\nGS&Co. that it may\nmake a market in the\nnotes or deposit notes\nand it is possible\nthat our other\naffiliates involved in\nthe distribution of\nthe notes or deposit\nnotes may also do so.\nNeither GS&Co. nor any\nof our other\naffiliates, however,\nis obligated to do so\nand any one of them\nmay discontinue\nmarket-making at any\ntime\nwithout notice. No\nassurance can be given\nas to the liquidity or\nthe trading market for\nthe notes or deposit\nnotes.\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nGS&Co. is an affiliate\nof The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. and, as\nsuch, will have a\n\u0093conflict of interest\u0094\nin any offering of the\nnotes or\ndeposit notes within\nthe meaning of FINRA\nRule 5121.\nConsequently, any\noffering of the notes\nor deposit notes will\nbe conducted in\ncompliance with the\nprovisions of Rule\n5121. GS&Co. will not\nbe permitted to sell\nnotes or deposit notes\nwith our\nguarantees in any\noffering to an account\nover which it\nexercises\ndiscretionary\nauthority without the\nprior specific written\napproval of the\naccount holder.\n\nEMPLOYEE RETIREMENT\nINCOME SECURITY ACT\n\nThis section is\nrelevant to you only\nif you are an\ninsurance company or\nthe fiduciary of a\npension plan or an\nemployee benefit plan\n(including a\ngovernmental plan, an\nIRA or a Keogh Plan)\nproposing to invest in\nthe notes or deposit\nnotes, in each case\nwith our guarantee.\n\nThe U.S. Employee\nRetirement Income\nSecurity Act of 1974,\nas amended (\u0093ERISA\u0094),\nand the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986,\nas amended (the\n\u0093Code\u0094), prohibit\ncertain transactions\n(\u0093prohibited\ntransactions\u0094)\ninvolving the assets\nof an employee benefit\nplan that is subject\nto the fiduciary\nresponsibility\nprovisions of ERISA or\nSection 4975 of the\nCode (including\nindividual retirement\naccounts, Keogh plans\nand other plans\ndescribed in Section\n4975(e)(1) of the\nCode) (a \u0093Plan\u0094) and\ncertain persons who\nare \u0093parties in\ninterest\u0094 (within the\nmeaning of ERISA) or\n\u0093disqualified\npersons\u0094 (within the\nmeaning of the Code)\nwith respect to the\nPlan; governmental\nplans may be subject\nto similar\nprohibitions unless an\nexemption applies to\nthe transaction.

Each Issuer Trust may offer to the\npublic, from time to time, preferred\nsecurities representing preferred beneficial\ninterests in the applicable Issuer Trust,\nwhich we call \u0093capital securities\u0094. In\naddition to capital securities offered to the\npublic, each Issuer Trust will sell common\nsecurities representing common beneficial\ninterests in such Issuer Trust to The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc., and we call these\nsecurities \u0093trust common securities\u0094. All of\nthe trust common securities of each Issuer\nTrust will be owned by us. The trust common\nsecurities and the capital securities are also\nreferred to together as the \u0093trust\nsecurities\u0094. Each Issuer Trust exists for the\nexclusive purposes of:\n                                              \n      issuing and selling its trust           \n      securities;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      using the proceeds from the sale of     \n      these trust securities to acquire       \n      corresponding subordinated debt         \n      securities from us;                     \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      engaging in only those other            \n      activities necessary or incidental to   \n      these purposes (for example,            \n      registering the transfer of             \n      the trust securities).                  \n                                              \nWhen any Issuer Trust sells trust securities,\nit will use the money it receives to buy a\nseries of our subordinated debt securities,\nwhich we call the \u0093corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities\u0094 for those trust securities.\nThe payment terms of the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities will be\nsubstantially the same as the terms of that\nIssuer Trust\u0092s capital securities, which we\ncall the \u0093related capital securities\u0094. Each\nIssuer Trust will own only the applicable\nseries of corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities. The only source of funds for each\nIssuer Trust will be the payments it receives\nfrom us on 7\n\nthe corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities. Each Issuer Trust will use these\nfunds to make any cash payments due to holders\nof its capital securities. Each Issuer Trust\nwill also be a party to an expense agreement\nwith The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Under the\nterms of the expense agreement, the Issuer\nTrust will have the right to be reimbursed by\nus for certain expenses. The trust common\nsecurities of an Issuer Trust will rank\nequally, and payments on them will be made pro\nrata, with the capital securities of that\nIssuer Trust, except that upon the occurrence\nand continuance of an event of default under a\ntrust agreement of such Issuer Trust resulting\nfrom an event of default under the\nsubordinated debt indenture, our rights, as\nholder of the trust common securities, to\npayment in respect of distributions and\npayments upon liquidation or redemption will\nbe subordinated to the rights of the holders\nof the capital securities of that Issuer\nTrust. See \u0093Description of Capital Securities\nand Related Instruments \u0097 Subordination of\nTrust Common Securities\u0094. We will acquire\ntrust common securities in an aggregate\nliquidation amount greater than or equal to 3%\nof the total capital of each Issuer Trust. The\nprospectus supplement relating to any capital\nsecurities will contain the details of the\ncash distributions to be made periodically.\nUnder certain circumstances, we may redeem the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities\nthat we sold to an Issuer Trust. If this\nhappens, the Issuer Trust will redeem a like\namount of the capital securities that it sold\nto the public and the trust common securities\nthat it sold to us. Under certain\ncircumstances, we may dissolve an Issuer Trust\nand cause the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities to be distributed to the holders of\nthe related capital securities. If this\nhappens, owners of the related capital\nsecurities will no longer have any interest in\nsuch Issuer Trust and will own only the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities we\nissued to the Issuer Trust.

Also, in this\nsection, references to \u0093holders\u0094 mean those\nwho own capital securities registered in their\nown names, on the books that the Issuer Trust\nor property trustee maintains for this\npurpose, and not those who own beneficial\ninterests in capital securities registered in\nstreet name or in capital securities issued in\nbook-entry form through one or more\ndepositaries. Owners of beneficial interest in\nthe capital securities should read the section\nbelow entitled \u0093Legal Ownership and Book-Entry\nIssuance\u0094.\n\nGeneral\n\nPursuant to the terms\nof the trust agreement for each Issuer Trust,\neach Issuer Trust will sell capital securities\nto the public and trust common securities to\nus. The capital securities represent preferred\nbeneficial interests in the Issuer Trust that\nsold them. Holders\nof the capital securities will be entitled to\nreceive distributions and amounts payable on\nredemption or liquidation ahead of holders of\nthe trust common securities. A more complete\ndiscussion appears below under the heading \u0093\u0097\nSubordination of Trust Common Securities\u0094.\nHolders of the capital securities will also be\nentitled to other benefits as described in the\ncorresponding trust agreement.\n\nEach of the Issuer Trusts is a legally\nseparate entity and the assets of one are not\navailable to satisfy the obligations of any of\nthe others.\n\nThe capital securities of an Issuer Trust will\nrank on a parity, and payments on them will be\nmade pro rata, with the trust common\nsecurities of that\nIssuer Trust except as described under \u0093\u0097\nSubordination of Trust Common Securities\u0094.\nLegal title to the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities will be held and administered\nby the property trustee in trust for the\nbenefit of the\nholders of the related capital securities and\ntrust common securities.\n\nThe trustees for each Issuer Trust will be The\nBank of New York Mellon, as\nproperty trustee, and BNY Mellon Trust of\nDelaware, as Delaware trustee, and two\nindividual administrative trustees who are\nemployees or officers of us or our affiliates.\n\nEach guarantee agreement executed by us for\nthe benefit of the holders of an Issuer\nTrust\u0092s capital securities will be a guarantee\non a\nsubordinated basis with respect to the related\ncapital securities but will not guarantee\npayment of distributions or amounts payable on\nredemption or liquidation of such capital\nsecurities when the related Issuer Trust does\nnot have funds on hand\navailable to make such payments. See\n\u0093Guarantees and Expense Agreements\u0094 below.\n\nEach Issuer Trust May Issue Series of Capital\nSecurities With Different Terms\n\nEach Issuer Trust may issue one distinct\nseries of capital securities. This section\nsummarizes terms of the\nsecurities that apply generally to all series\nof capital securities. The provisions of the\ntrust agreements allow the Issuer Trusts to\nissue series of capital securities with terms\ndifferent from one another. We describe most\nof the financial and\nother specific terms of your series in the\nprospectus supplement accompanying this\nprospectus. Those terms may vary from the\nterms described here.\n\nAs you read this section, please remember that\nthe specific terms of your capital security as\ndescribed in your prospectus supplement will\nsupplement and, if applicable, may modify or\nreplace the general terms described in this\nsection. If there are any differences between\nyour prospectus supplement and this\nprospectus, your prospectus supplement will\ncontrol. Thus, the statements we make in this\nsection may not apply to your capital\nsecurity.\n\n10\n\nWhen we refer to a series of capital\nsecurities, we mean a series issued under the\napplicable trust agreement. When we refer to\nyour prospectus supplement, we mean the\nprospectus supplement describing the specific\nterms of the capital security you purchase.\nThe terms used in your prospectus supplement\nwill have the meanings described in this\nprospectus, unless otherwise specified.\nAmounts That We May Issue The trust agreements\ndo not limit the aggregate amount of capital\nsecurities that may be issued or the aggregate\namount of any particular series. We and the\nIssuer Trusts may issue capital securities and\nother securities at any time without your\nconsent and without notifying you. The trust\nagreements and the capital securities do not\nlimit our ability to incur indebtedness or to\nissue other securities. Also, we are not\nsubject to financial or similar restrictions\nby the terms of the capital securities. In the\nfuture, we may form additional trusts or other\nentities similar to the Issuer Trusts, and\nthose other entities could issue securities\nsimilar to the trust securities described in\nthis section. In that event, we may issue\nsubordinated debt securities under the\nsubordinated debt indenture to those other\nissuer entities and guarantees under a\nguarantee agreement with respect to the\nsecurities they issue. We may also enter into\nexpense agreements with those other issuers.\nThe subordinated debt securities and\nguarantees we issue (and expense agreements we\nenter into) in those cases would be similar to\nthose described in this prospectus, with such\nmodifications as may be described in the\napplicable prospectus supplement.\nDistributions Distributions on the capital\nsecurities will be cumulative, will accumulate\nfrom the original issue date (unless otherwise\nspecified in your prospectus supplement) and\nwill be payable on the dates specified in your\nprospectus supplement. In the event that any\ndate on which distributions on the capital\nsecurities are payable is not a business day,\npayment of that distribution will be made on\nthe next business day (and without any\ninterest or other payment in connection with\nthis delay) except that, if the next business\nday falls in the next calendar year, payment\nof the distribution will be made on the\nimmediately preceding business day, in either\ncase with the same force and effect as if made\non the original distribution date. Each date\non which distributions are payable in\naccordance with the previous sentence is\nreferred to as a \u0093distribution date\u0094.

Each Issuer Trust\u0092s\ncapital securities represent preferred\nbeneficial interests in the applicable Issuer\nTrust, and the distributions on each capital\nsecurity will be payable at a rate specified\nin your prospectus supplement. Unless your\nprospectus supplement provides that the amount\nof distributions payable for any period will\nbe computed on a different basis, the amount\nof distributions payable for any period will\nbe computed on the basis of 30/360 (ISDA) as\nfollows: [360 x (Y2 - Y1)] + [30 x (M2 - M1)]\n+ (D2 - D1) 360 where:\n                                              \n      \u0093Yl\u0094 is the year, expressed as a number,  \n      in which the first day of the period    \n      falls;                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      \u0093Y2\u0094 is the year, expressed as a number,  \n      in which the day immediately following  \n      the last day included in the            \n      period falls;                           \n                                              \n11\n                                              \n      \u0093M1\u0094 is the calendar month, expressed as  \n      a number, in which the first day of     \n      the period falls;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      \u0093M2\u0094 is the calendar month, expressed as  \n      a number, in which the day immediately  \n      following the last day included         \n      in the period falls;                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      \u0093D1\u0094 is the first calendar day,           \n      expressed as a number, of the period,   \n      unless such number would be 31, in      \n      which                                   \n      case D1 will be 30; and                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      \u0093D2\u0094 is the calendar day, expressed as a  \n      number, immediately following the last  \n      day included in the period,             \n      unless such number would be 31 and D1   \n      is greater than 29, in which case D2    \n      will be 30.                             \n                                              \nDistributions to which holders of capital\nsecurities are entitled will accumulate\nadditional distributions at the rate per annum\nif and as specified in your prospectus\nsupplement. The term \u0093distributions\u0094 as used\nin this summary includes these additional\ndistributions unless otherwise stated. If an\nextension period occurs with respect to the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities,\ndistributions on the related capital\nsecurities will be correspondingly deferred\n(but would continue to accumulate additional\ndistributions at the rate per annum set forth\nin the prospectus supplement for the capital\nsecurities). See \u0093-Corresponding Subordinated\nDebt Securities \u0097 Option to Defer Interest\nPayments\u0094 below. The revenue of each Issuer\nTrust available for distribution to holders of\nits capital securities will be limited to\npayments under the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities which the Issuer Trust will\nacquire with the proceeds from the issuance\nand sale of its trust securities. See \u0093\u0097\nCorresponding Subordinated Debt Securities\u0094.\nIf we do not make interest payments on the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities,\nthe property trustee will not have funds\navailable to pay distributions on the related\ncapital securities. The payment of\ndistributions (if and to the extent the Issuer\nTrust has funds legally available for the\npayment of distributions and cash sufficient\nto make payments) is guaranteed by us as\ndescribed below under the heading \u0093\u0097\nGuarantees and Expense Agreements\u0094.\nDistributions on the capital securities will\nbe payable to the holders of capital\nsecurities as they appear on the register of\nthe Issuer Trust at the close of business on\nthe relevant record dates, which, as long as\nthe capital securities remain in book-entry\nform, will be one business day prior to the\nrelevant distribution date. Subject to any\napplicable laws and regulations and the\nprovisions of the applicable trust agreement,\neach such payment will be made as described\nunder the heading \u0093Legal Ownership and Book-\nEntry Issuance\u0094. In the event any capital\nsecurities are not in book-entry form, the\nrelevant record date for such capital\nsecurities will be the date 15 days prior to\nthe relevant distribution date (whether or not\na business day). Redemption or Exchange\nMandatory Redemption Upon the repayment or\nredemption, in whole or in part, of any\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities,\nwhether at their stated maturity or before\ntheir stated maturity as provided in the\nsubordinated debt indenture, the proceeds from\nthe repayment or redemption will be applied by\nthe property trustee to redeem a like amount\n(as defined below) of the capital securities,\nupon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days\u0092\nnotice before the applicable redemption date,\nat the redemption price specified in your\nprospectus supplement. If less than all of any\nseries of corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities are to be repaid or redeemed on a\nredemption date, then the proceeds from the\nrepayment or redemption will be allocated pro\nrata to the redemption of the related capital\nsecurities and the trust common securities\nbased upon the relative liquidation amounts of\nthese classes. The amount of premium, if any,\npaid by us upon the redemption of all or any\npart of any series of any 12\n\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities to\nbe repaid or redeemed on a redemption date\nwill be allocated to the redemption pro rata\nof the related capital securities and the\ntrust common securities. The redemption price\nwill be payable on each redemption date only\nto the extent that the Issuer Trust has funds\nthen on hand and available in the payment\naccount for the payment of the redemption\nprice. We will have the right to redeem any\nseries of corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities:\n                                              \n      on or after such date as may be         \n      specified in the applicable prospectus  \n      supplement, in whole at any time or in  \n      part from                               \n      time to time;

Tax\nEvent or Investment Company Event Redemption\nIf a tax event or investment company event (or\nany other event specified in your prospectus\nsupplement) in respect of a series of capital\nsecurities and trust common securities has\noccurred and is continuing, we have the right\nto redeem the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities in whole (but not in part) and\nthereby cause a mandatory redemption of the\ncapital securities and trust common securities\nin whole (but not in part) at the redemption\nprice within 90 days following the occurrence\nof the tax event or investment company event\n(or other specified event). If a tax event or\ninvestment company event (or other specified\nevent) has occurred and is continuing in\nrespect of a series of capital securities and\ntrust common securities and we do not elect to\nredeem the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities and thereby cause a mandatory\nredemption of the capital securities or to\ndissolve and liquidate the related Issuer\nTrust and cause the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities to be distributed to holders\nof the capital securities and trust common\nsecurities in liquidation of the Issuer Trust\nas described below, such capital securities\nwill remain outstanding and additional sums\n(as defined below) may be payable on the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities.\nThe term \u0093additional sums\u0094 means the\nadditional amounts as may be necessary in\norder that the amount of distributions then\ndue and payable by an Issuer Trust on the\noutstanding capital securities and trust\ncommon securities of the Issuer Trust will not\nbe reduced as a result of any additional\ntaxes, duties and other governmental charges\nto which the Issuer Trust has become subject\nas a result of a tax event.

In\nthe event that any related capital securities\nare not in book-entry form, the relevant\nrecord date will be a date 15 days prior to\nthe liquidation date (whether or not a\nbusiness day), as specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. 14\n\nThere can be no assurance as to the market\nprices for the related capital securities or\nthe\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities\nthat may be distributed in exchange for\nrelated capital securities if a dissolution\nand liquidation of an Issuer Trust were to\noccur. Accordingly, the related capital\nsecurities that an investor may\npurchase, or the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities that the investor may receive\non dissolution and liquidation of an Issuer\nTrust, may trade at a discount to the price\nthat the investor paid to purchase the related\ncapital securities being\noffered in connection with this prospectus.\n\nRedemption Procedures\n\nCapital securities redeemed on each redemption\ndate will be redeemed at the redemption price\nwith the applicable proceeds from the\ncontemporaneous\nredemption of the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities. Redemptions of the capital\nsecurities will be made and the redemption\nprice will be payable on each redemption date\nonly to the extent that the related Issuer\nTrust has funds on hand\navailable for the payment of the redemption\nprice. See also \u0093\u0097 Subordination of Trust\nCommon Securities\u0094 below.\n\nIf the property\ntrustee gives a notice of redemption in\nrespect of any capital securities, then, while\nsuch capital securities are in book-entry\nform, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on\nthe redemption date, to the extent funds are\navailable, the property trustee\nwill deposit irrevocably with the depositary\nfunds sufficient to pay the applicable\nredemption price and will give the depositary\nirrevocable instructions and authority to pay\nthe redemption price to the holders of the\ncapital securities. See\n\u0093Legal Ownership and Book-Entry Issuance\u0094\nbelow. If the capital securities are no longer\nin book-entry form, the property trustee, to\nthe extent funds are available, will\nirrevocably deposit with the paying agent for\nthe capital securities\nfunds sufficient to pay the applicable\nredemption price and will give the paying\nagent irrevocable instructions and authority\nto pay the redemption price to the holders\nupon surrender of their certificates\nevidencing the capital securities.\nNotwithstanding the above, distributions\npayable on or prior to the redemption date for\nany capital securities called for redemption\nwill be payable to the holders of the capital\nsecurities on the relevant record dates for\nthe related distribution\ndates. If notice of redemption has been given\nand funds deposited as required, then upon the\ndate of the deposit, all rights of the holders\nof the capital securities so called for\nredemption will cease, except the right of the\nholders of the capital\nsecurities to receive the redemption price and\nany distribution payable in respect of the\ncapital securities on or prior to the\nredemption date, but without interest on the\nredemption price, and the capital securities\nwill cease to be outstanding.\nIn the event that any date fixed for\nredemption of capital securities is not a\nbusiness day, then payment of the redemption\nprice will be made on the next business day\n(and without any interest or other payment in\nconnection with this delay) except\nthat, if the next business day falls in the\nnext calendar year, payment of the redemption\nprice will be made on the immediately\npreceding business day, in either case with\nthe same force and effect as if made on the\noriginal date. In the event that\npayment of the redemption price in respect of\ncapital securities called for redemption is\nimproperly withheld or refused and not paid\neither by an Issuer Trust or by us pursuant to\nthe related guarantee as described below under\n\u0093\u0097\nGuarantees and Expense Agreements\u0094,\ndistributions on the capital securities will\ncontinue to accumulate at the then applicable\nrate from the redemption date originally\nestablished by the Issuer Trust for the\ncapital securities to the date the\nredemption price is actually paid, in which\ncase the date the redemption price is actually\npaid will be the date fixed for redemption for\npurposes of calculating the redemption price.\n\nWe or our affiliates may at any time and from\ntime to time purchase outstanding capital\nsecurities by tender, in the open market or by\nprivate\nagreement.\n\nPayment of the redemption price on the capital\nsecurities and any distribution of\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities to\nholders\nof capital securities will be made to the\napplicable record\n\n15\n\nholders as they appear on the register for the\ncapital securities on the relevant record\ndate, which, as long as the capital securities\nremain in book-entry form, will be the\nbusiness day prior\nto the relevant redemption date or liquidation\ndate, as applicable; provided, however, that\nin the event that the capital securities are\nnot in book-entry form, the relevant record\ndate for the capital securities will be a date\nat least 15 calendar\ndays prior to the redemption date or\nliquidation date, as applicable, as specified\nin the applicable prospectus supplement.\n\nIf less than all of the\ncapital securities and trust common securities\nissued by an Issuer Trust are to be redeemed\non a redemption date, then the aggregate\nliquidation amount of the capital securities\nand trust common securities to be redeemed\nwill be allocated pro rata\nto the capital securities and the trust common\nsecurities based upon the relative liquidation\namounts of these classes. The particular\ncapital securities to be redeemed will be\nselected on a pro rata basis not more than 60\ndays prior to the\napplicable redemption date by the property\ntrustee from the outstanding capital\nsecurities not previously called for\nredemption, by a customary method that the\nproperty trustee deems fair and appropriate\nand which may provide for the selection for\nredemption of portions (equal to $1,000 or an\nintegral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof,\nunless a different amount is specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement) of the\nliquidation amount of capital securities of a\ndenomination larger\nthan $1,000 (or another denomination as\nspecified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement). The property trustee will\npromptly notify the securities registrar in\nwriting of the capital securities selected for\nredemption and, in the case of any\ncapital securities selected for partial\nredemption, the liquidation amount to be\nredeemed. For all purposes of each trust\nagreement, unless the context otherwise\nrequires, all provisions relating to the\nredemption of capital securities will relate,\nin the case of any capital securities redeemed\nor to be redeemed only in part, to the portion\nof the aggregate liquidation amount of capital\nsecurities which has been or is to be\nredeemed.\n\nIf we exercise an option to redeem any capital\nsecurities, the property trustee will give to\nthe holders written notice of the aggregate\nliquidation\namount of capital securities to be redeemed,\nnot less than 30 nor more than 60 days before\nthe applicable redemption date. The property\ntrustee will give the notice in the manner\ndescribed below in \u0093\u0097 Notices\u0094.\n\nUnless we default in payment of the redemption\nprice on the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities interest will cease to accrue on\nthe subordinated\ndebt securities or portions thereof (and\ndistributions will cease to accrue on the\nrelated capital securities or portions\nthereof) called for redemption on and after\nthe redemption date.\n\nDistribution of Corresponding Subordinated\nDebt Securities\n\nWe have the right at any time to dissolve any\nIssuer Trust and, after satisfaction of the\nliabilities of creditors of the Issuer Trust\nas provided by\napplicable law, cause to be distributed in\nrespect of each series of capital securities\nand trust common securities issued by the\nIssuer Trust, to the holders of such trust\nsecurities, a like amount of the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities\nin liquidation of the Issuer Trust.\n\nThe term \u0093like amount\u0094 means, with respect to\na distribution of corresponding subordinated\ndebt\nsecurities to holders of any series of trust\nsecurities in connection with a dissolution or\nliquidation of the related Issuer Trust,\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities\nhaving a principal amount equal to the\nliquidation amount of the trust\nsecurities in respect of which the\ndistribution is made.\n\nIf we or any of our affiliates acquire capital\nsecurities, we may exchange them for a like\namount of corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities at any time.\n\n16\n\nSubordination of Trust Common Securities\nPayment of distributions on, and the\nredemption price of, each Issuer Trust\u0092s\ncapital securities and trust common\nsecurities, as applicable, will be made pro\nrata based on the liquidation amount of the\ncapital securities and trust common\nsecurities; provided, however, that if on any\ndistribution date, redemption date or\nliquidation date an event of default under the\nsubordinated debt indenture has occurred and\nis continuing as a result of any failure by us\nto pay any amounts in respect of the\nsubordinated debt securities when due, no\npayment of any distribution on, or redemption\nprice of, or liquidation distribution in\nrespect of, any of the Issuer Trust\u0092s trust\ncommon securities, and no other payment on\naccount of the redemption, liquidation or\nother acquisition of the trust common\nsecurities, will be made unless payment in\nfull in cash of all accumulated and unpaid\ndistributions on all of the Issuer Trust\u0092s\noutstanding capital securities for all\ndistribution periods terminating on or prior\nto that date, or in the case of payment of the\nredemption price the full amount of the\nredemption price on all of the Issuer Trust\u0092s\noutstanding capital securities then called for\nredemption, or in the case of payment of the\nliquidation distribution the full amount of\nthe liquidation distribution on all of the\nIssuer Trust\u0092s outstanding capital securities,\nhas been made or provided for, and all funds\navailable to the property trustee must first\nbe applied to the payment in full in cash of\nall distributions on, or the redemption price\nof, the Issuer Trust\u0092s outstanding capital\nsecurities then due and payable. In the case\nof any event of default under the applicable\ntrust agreement resulting from an event of\ndefault under the subordinated debt indenture,\nwe as holder of the Issuer Trust\u0092s trust\ncommon securities will have no right to act\nwith respect to the event of default until the\neffect of all events of default with respect\nto such Issuer Trust\u0092s capital securities have\nbeen cured, waived or otherwise eliminated.\nUntil any events of default under the\napplicable trust agreement with respect to the\napplicable capital securities have been cured,\nwaived or otherwise eliminated, the property\ntrustee will act solely on behalf of the\nholders of these capital securities and not on\nbehalf of us as holder of the Issuer Trust\u0092s\ntrust common securities, and only these\nholders of the capital securities will have\nthe right to direct the property trustee to\nact on their behalf. Liquidation Distribution\nUpon Dissolution Pursuant to the relevant\ntrust agreement, each Issuer Trust will\ndissolve on the first to occur of:\n                                   \n      the expiration of its term;  \n                                   \n                                              \n      certain events of bankruptcy,           \n      dissolution or liquidation of the       \n      holder of its trust common securities;  \n                                              \n                                              \n      the distribution of a like amount of    \n      the corresponding subordinated debt     \n      securities to the holders of its trust  \n      securities,                             \n      if we have given written direction to   \n      the property trustee to terminate the   \n      Issuer Trust.

If the\nliquidation distribution can be paid only in\npart because the Issuer Trust has insufficient\nassets available to pay in full the aggregate\nliquidation distribution, then the amounts\npayable directly by the Issuer Trust on its\ncapital securities will be paid on a pro rata\nbasis. The holder of the Issuer Trust\u0092s trust\ncommon securities will be entitled to receive\ndistributions upon any liquidation pro rata\nwith the holders of its capital securities,\nexcept that if an event of default under the\nsubordinated debt indenture has occurred and\nis continuing as a result of any failure by us\nto pay any amounts in respect of the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities\nwhen due, the related capital securities will\nhave a priority over the related trust common\nsecurities.

We, as depositor, and the\nadministrative trustees are required to file\nannually with the property trustee a\ncertificate as to whether or not they are in\ncompliance with all the conditions and\ncovenants applicable to them under the\nrelevant trust agreement. If an event of\ndefault under the subordinated debt indenture\nhas occurred and is continuing with respect to\na series of corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities, the series of related capital\nsecurities will have a preference over the\nrelated trust common securities of the\nrelevant Issuer Trust as described above. See\n\u0093\u0097 Liquidation Distribution Upon Dissolution\u0094\nabove. The existence of an event of default\ndoes not entitle the holders of capital\nsecurities to accelerate the maturity of the\ncapital securities. Whenever we refer to an\nevent of default under the subordinated debt\nindenture in connection with any series of\ncapital securities, we mean such an event of\ndefault with respect to the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities. Removal of\nIssuer Trust Trustees Unless an event of\ndefault under the subordinated debt indenture\nhas occurred and is continuing, any Issuer\nTrust trustee may be removed at any time by\nthe holder of the Issuer Trust\u0092s trust common\nsecurities. If an event of default under the\nsubordinated debt indenture has occurred and\nis continuing with respect to a series of\ncapital securities, the property trustee and\nthe Delaware trustee may be removed under the\napplicable trust agreement by the holders of a\nmajority in liquidation amount of the\noutstanding capital securities of such series.\nIn no event will the holders of the capital\nsecurities have the right to vote to appoint,\nremove or replace the administrative trustees.\nSuch voting rights are vested exclusively in\nus as the holder of the trust common\nsecurities. No resignation or removal of an\nIssuer Trust trustee and no appointment of a\nsuccessor trustee will be effective until the\nacceptance of appointment by the successor\ntrustee in accordance with the provisions of\nthe applicable trust agreement. Co-Trusteesand\nSeparate Property Trustee Unless an event of\ndefault under the subordinated debt indenture\nhas occurred and is continuing, at any time or\nfrom time to time, for the purpose of meeting\nthe legal requirements of the Trust Indenture\nAct or of any jurisdiction in which any part\nof the trust property may at the time be\nlocated, we, as the holder of the trust common\nsecurities, and the administrative trustees\nwill have power to appoint one or more persons\neither to act as a co-trustee,jointly with the\nproperty trustee, of all or any part of the\ntrust property, or to act as separate trustee\nof any trust property, in either case with the\npowers specified in the instrument of\nappointment, and to vest in the person or\npersons in this capacity any property, title,\nright or power deemed necessary or desirable,\nsubject to the provisions of the applicable\ntrust agreement. In case an event of default\nunder the subordinated debt indenture has\noccurred and is continuing, the property\ntrustee alone will have power to make this\nappointment. Merger or Consolidation of Issuer\nTrust Trustees Any person into which the\nproperty trustee, the Delaware trustee or any\nadministrative trustee that is not a natural\nperson may be merged or converted or with\nwhich it may be consolidated, or any 19\n\nperson resulting from any merger, conversion\nor consolidation to which the trustee will be\na party, or any person succeeding to all or\nsubstantially all the corporate trust business\nof the trustee, will automatically become the\nsuccessor of the trustee under each trust\nagreement, provided the person is otherwise\nqualified and eligible.

The depositary arrangements\nthat will apply, including the\nmanner in which principal of and premium, if\nany, and interest on capital securities and\nother payments will be payable are discussed\nin more detail below under the heading \u0093Legal\nOwnership and Book-Entry Issuance\u0094.\n\nPayment and Paying Agency\n\nPayments in respect\nof capital securities will be made in\naccordance with the applicable policies of DTC\nas described under \u0093Legal Ownership and Book-\nEntry Issuance\u0094. If any capital securities are\nnot represented by global certificates,\npayments will be made\nby check mailed to the holder entitled to them\nat his or her address shown on the property\ntrustee\u0092s records as of the close of business\non the regular record date. Unless otherwise\nspecified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, the paying\nagent will initially be the property trustee\nand any co-paying agent chosen by the property\ntrustee and reasonably acceptable to the\nadministrative trustees and us. The paying\nagent will be permitted to resign\nas paying agent upon 30 days\u0092 written notice\nto the property trustee and us. In the event\nthat the property trustee is no longer the\npaying agent, the administrative trustees will\nappoint a successor (which will be a bank or\ntrust company\nacceptable to the administrative trustees and\nus) to act as paying agent.\n\nRegistrar and Transfer Agent\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, the property trustee\nwill act as registrar and transfer agent for\nthe capital\nsecurities.\n\nRegistration of transfers of capital\nsecurities will be effected without charge by\nor on behalf of each Issuer Trust, but upon\npayment\nof any tax or other governmental charges that\nmay be imposed in connection with any transfer\nor exchange. The Issuer Trusts will not be\nrequired to register or cause to be registered\nthe transfer of their capital securities after\nthe capital\nsecurities have been called for redemption.\n\nInformation Concerning the Property Trustee\n\nThe property trustee, other than during the\noccurrence and continuance of an event of\ndefault, undertakes to perform only those\nduties specifically set\nforth in each trust agreement and, after an\nevent of default, must exercise the same\ndegree of care and skill as a prudent person\nwould exercise\n\n23\n\nor use in the conduct of his or her own\naffairs. Subject to this provision, the\nproperty trustee is under no obligation to\nexercise any of the powers vested in it by the\napplicable trust\nagreement at the request of any holder of\ncapital securities unless it is offered\nreasonable indemnity against the costs,\nexpenses and liabilities that might be\nincurred as a result. If no event of default\nhas occurred and is continuing and the\nproperty trustee is required to decide between\nalternative causes of action, construe\nambiguous provisions in the applicable trust\nagreement or is unsure of the application of\nany provision of the applicable trust\nagreement, and the matter is not\none on which holders of capital securities are\nentitled under the trust agreement to vote,\nthen the property trustee will take such\naction as is directed by us and if not so\ndirected, will take such action as it deems\nadvisable and in the best\ninterests of the holders of the trust\nsecurities and will have no liability except\nfor its own bad faith, negligence or willful\nmisconduct.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThe administrative trustees are\nauthorized and directed to conduct the affairs\nof and to operate the Issuer Trusts in such a\nway that no Issuer Trust will be (1) deemed to\nbe an \u0093investment company\u0094 required to be\nregistered under the Investment Company Act or\n(2) classified as an association taxable as a\ncorporation or as other than a grantor trust\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes and so\nthat the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities will be treated as indebtedness of\nThe Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. In addition, we and the\nadministrative trustees are authorized to take\nany action not inconsistent with applicable\nlaw, the certificate of trust of each Issuer\nTrust or each trust agreement, that we\nand the administrative trustees determine in\ntheir discretion to be necessary or desirable\nfor such purposes as long as such action does\nnot materially adversely affect the interests\nof the holders of the related capital\nsecurities.\n\nHolders of the capital securities have no\npreemptive or similar rights.\n\nNo Issuer Trust may borrow money or issue debt\nor mortgage or pledge any of its assets.\n\nCorresponding Subordinated Debt Securities\n\nThe corresponding subordinated debt securities\nmay be issued in one or more series under the\nSubordinated Debt Indenture, dated as of\nFebruary 20,\n2004, as amended and supplemented (the\n\u0093subordinated debt indenture\u0094), between us and\nThe Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. Each\nseries will be a series of subordinated debt\nsecurities having the terms described in this\nsection, with\nsuch modifications as are described in the\napplicable prospectus supplement.\n\nConcurrently with the issuance of each Issuer\nTrust\u0092s capital\nsecurities, the Issuer Trust will invest the\nproceeds thereof and the consideration paid by\nus for the trust common securities of the\nIssuer Trust in the series of corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities issued by us to\nthe Issuer Trust. Each\nseries of corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities will be in the principal amount\nequal to the aggregate stated liquidation\namount of the related capital securities and\nthe trust common securities of the Issuer\nTrust and will rank on a parity\nwith all other series of corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities (but junior to\nmost of our other debt) unless otherwise\nprovided in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement.

Unless and until the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities are\ndistributed to the holders of the related\ncapital securities in exchange for the latter,\nthe relevant Issuer Trust (or property\ntrustee) will be the sole holder of those debt\nsecurities for all purposes of the\nsubordinated debt indenture, and the holders\nof the related capital securities will not\nhave any ownership right, direct or indirect,\nwith respect to those debt securities. Upon a\ndistribution of this kind, the sole holder of\nthose corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities will be the relevant depositary, if\nthe corresponding subordinated debt securities\nare distributed in book-entry form, or the\nformer holders of the related capital\nsecurities who receive them in the\ndistribution, if the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities are not\ndistributed in book-entry form. See also\n\u0093Legal Ownership and Book-Entry Issuance\u0094\nbelow. Option to Defer Interest Payments If\nprovided in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, so long as no event of default\nunder the subordinated debt indenture has\noccurred and is continuing, we will have the\nright at any time and from time to time during\nthe term of any series of subordinated debt\nsecurities to defer payment of interest for up\nto the number of consecutive interest payment\nperiods that is specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, referred to as an\n\u0093extension period\u0094, subject to the terms,\nconditions and covenants, if any, specified in\nthe prospectus supplement, provided that the\nextension period may not extend beyond the\nstated maturity of the applicable series of\nsubordinated debt securities. Prior to the\ntermination of any applicable extension\nperiod, we may further defer the payment of\ninterest (subject to 25\n\nthe terms, conditions and covenants, if any,\nspecified in the prospectus supplement), but\nnot beyond the specified number of interest\npayment periods or the stated maturity of the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities. As\na consequence of any such deferral,\ndistributions on the capital securities would\nbe deferred and would not result in any\ndefault (but would continue to accumulate\nadditional distributions at the rate per annum\ndescribed in the prospectus supplement for the\ncapital securities) by the Issuer Trust of the\ncapital securities during the extension\nperiod. During any applicable extension\nperiod, we may not, and may not permit any\nsubsidiary to:\n                                              \n      declare or pay any dividends or         \n      distributions on, or redeem, purchase,  \n      acquire or make a liquidation payment   \n      with respect                            \n      to, any of our capital stock; or        \n                                              \n                                              \n      make any payment of principal of or     \n      interest or premium, if any, on or      \n      repay, repurchase or redeem any of our  \n      debt                                    \n      securities that rank on a parity in     \n      all respects with or junior in          \n      interest in all respects to the         \n      corresponding subordinated debt         \n      securities;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      make any guarantee payments with        \n      respect to any guarantee by us of debt  \n      securities of any of our subsidiaries   \n      that rank on                            \n      a parity in all respects with or        \n      junior in interest in all respects to   \n      the corresponding subordinated debt     \n      securities;                             \n                                              \nin each case, other than:\n                                              \n      repurchases, redemptions or other       \n      acquisitions of shares of our capital   \n      stock in connection with any            \n      employment contract,                    \n      benefit plan or other similar           \n      arrangement with or for the benefit of  \n      one or more employees, officers,        \n      directors or consultants, in            \n      connection with a dividend              \n      reinvestment or stockholder stock       \n      purchase plan or in connection with     \n      the issuance of our                     \n      capital stock (or securities            \n      convertible into or exercisable for     \n      our capital stock) as consideration in  \n      an acquisition transaction entered      \n      into prior to the applicable extension  \n      period;                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      as a result of any exchange or          \n      conversion of any class or series of    \n      our capital stock (or any capital       \n      stock of a subsidiary                   \n      of ours) for any class or series of     \n      our capital stock or of any class or    \n      series of our indebtedness for any      \n      class or series of our capital stock;   \n                                              \n                                              \n      the purchase of fractional interests    \n      in shares of our capital stock in       \n      accordance with the conversion or       \n      exchange                                \n      provisions of such capital stock or     \n      the security being converted or         \n      exchanged;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      any declaration of a dividend in        \n      connection with any stockholders\u0092        \n      rights plan, or the issuance of         \n      rights, stock or                        \n      other property under any stockholders\u0092   \n      rights plan, or the redemption or       \n      repurchase of rights in accordance      \n      with any stockholders\u0092 rights plan;      \n                                              \n                                              \n      any dividend in the form of stock,      \n      warrants, options or other rights       \n      where the dividend stock or the stock   \n      issuable upon                           \n      exercise of the warrants, options or    \n      other rights is the same stock as that  \n      on which the dividend is being paid or  \n      ranks on a parity with or junior to     \n      such stock; or                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      any payments under any guarantees       \n      relating to any capital securities.     \n                                              \nMergers and Similar Transactions We are\ngenerally permitted to merge or consolidate\nwith another corporation or other entity. We\nare also permitted to sell our assets\nsubstantially as an entirety to another\ncorporation or other entity. With regard to\nany series of corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities, however, we may not take any of\nthese actions unless all the following\nconditions are met:\n                                              \n      If the successor entity in the          \n      transaction is not The Goldman Sachs    \n      Group, Inc., the successor entity must  \n      be organized as                         \n      a corporation, partnership or trust     \n      and must expressly assume               \n                                              \n26\n                                              \n  our obligations under the corresponding     \n  subordinated debt securities of that        \n  series and the underlying subordinated      \n  debt indenture with respect to that         \n  series. The successor entity may be         \n  organized under the laws of any             \n  jurisdiction, whether in the United States  \n  or elsewhere.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      Immediately after the transaction, no   \n      default under the corresponding         \n      subordinated debt securities of that    \n      series has                              \n      occurred and is continuing. For this    \n      purpose, \u0093default under the              \n      corresponding subordinated debt         \n      securities of that series\u0094 means an      \n      event of default with respect to that   \n      series or any event that would be an    \n      event of default with respect           \n      to that series if the requirements for  \n      giving us default notice and for our    \n      default having to continue for a        \n      specific period of time were            \n      disregarded. We describe these matters  \n      above under \u0093\u0097 Events of Default;         \n      Notice\u0094.                                 \n                                              \nIf the conditions described above are\nsatisfied with respect to the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities of any series, we\nwill not need to obtain the approval of the\nholders of those corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities in order to merge or\nconsolidate or to sell our assets. Also, these\nconditions will apply only if we wish to merge\nor consolidate with another entity or sell our\nassets substantially as an entirety to another\nentity. We will not need to satisfy these\nconditions if we enter into other types of\ntransactions, including any transaction in\nwhich we acquire the stock or assets of\nanother entity, any transaction that involves\na change of control of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. but in which we do not merge or\nconsolidate and any transaction in which we\nsell less than substantially all our assets.\nAlso, if we merge, consolidate or sell our\nassets substantially as an entirety and the\nsuccessor is a non-U.S.entity, neither we nor\nany successor would have any obligation to\ncompensate the holder of corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities for any resulting\nadverse tax consequences relating to\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities.\nSubordination The corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities will be subject to the\nprovisions in the subordinated debt indenture\nthat may prohibit us from making payments on\nthe subordinated debt securities. Subordinated\ndebt securities are subordinate and junior in\nright of payment, to the extent and in the\nmanner stated in the subordinated debt\nindenture, to all of our senior indebtedness,\nas defined in the subordinated debt indenture,\nincluding all debt securities we have issued\nand will issue under either of the senior debt\nindentures and all warrants we will issue\nunder the warrant indenture. The subordinated\ndebt indenture defines \u0093senior indebtedness\u0094\nas all indebtedness and obligations of, or\nguaranteed or assumed by, The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. for borrowed money or evidenced by\nbonds, debentures, notes or other similar\ninstruments, whether existing now or in the\nfuture, and all amendments, renewals,\nextensions, modifications and refundings of\nany indebtedness or obligations of that kind.\nSenior debt excludes the subordinated debt\nsecurities and any other indebtedness or\nobligations specifically designated as being\nsubordinate, or not superior, in right of\npayment to the subordinated debt securities.\nHowever, the definition of \u0093senior\nindebtedness\u0094 will be modified as provided in\nthe applicable prospectus supplement. As a\nresult of this modified definition of senior\nindebtedness, the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities may be subordinated and junior\nin right of payment to most of our\nindebtedness, including our senior debt, our\nsubordinated debt securities that are not\nissued to the Issuer Trusts and most of our\nother subordinated debt. The subordinated debt\nindenture does not limit our ability to incur\nadditional indebtedness of any kind, including\nadditional senior indebtedness. We expect from\ntime to time to incur additional indebtedness\nconstituting senior indebtedness. Modification\nof the Subordinated Debt Indenture As long as\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities are\nheld by or on behalf of an Issuer Trust, no\nmodification may be made that adversely\naffects the holders of such series of capital\nsecurities in 27\n\nany material respect, and no termination of\nthe subordinated debt indenture may occur, and\nno waiver of any event of default under the\nsubordinated debt indenture with respect to\nsuch series of capital securities may be\neffective, without the prior consent of the\nholders of at least a majority of the\naggregate liquidation amount of all\noutstanding capital securities of such series\naffected, unless and until the principal of\nthe corresponding subordinated debt securities\nand all accrued and unpaid interest have been\npaid in full and certain other conditions have\nbeen satisfied. If a consent under the\nsubordinated debt indenture would require the\nconsent of each holder of a series of\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities, no\nsuch consent will be given by the property\ntrustee without the prior consent of each\nholder of capital securities of the related\nseries affected.

The same majority\napproval would be required for us to obtain a\nwaiver of any of our covenants in the\nsubordinated debt indenture. We may not amend\nthe subordinated debt indenture to alter the\nsubordination of any outstanding corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities without the\nwritten consent of each holder of senior\nindebtedness then outstanding who would be\nadversely affected. In addition, we may not\nmodify the subordination provisions of the\nsubordinated debt indenture in a manner that\nwould adversely affect the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities of any one or\nmore series then outstanding in any material\nrespect, without the consent of the holders of\na majority in aggregate principal amount of\nthe corresponding subordinated debt securities\nof that series then outstanding. Enforcement\nof Certain Rights by Holders of Capital\nSecurities If an event of default with respect\nto a series of corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities has occurred and is continuing and\nthe event is attributable to our failure to\npay interest or principal on the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities on the date the\ninterest or principal is due and payable (and\nafter a 30-daygrace period for interest\ndefaults), a holder of the related capital\nsecurities may institute a legal proceeding\ndirectly against us for enforcement of payment\nto that holder of the principal of or interest\non corresponding subordinated debt securities\nhaving a principal amount equal to the\naggregate liquidation amount of the related\ncapital securities of that holder (a \u0093direct\naction\u0094). We may not amend the subordinated\ndebt indenture to remove this right to bring a\ndirect action without the prior written\nconsent of the holders of all of the related\ncapital securities outstanding and affected.\nWe will have the right under the subordinated\ndebt indenture to set-offany payment made to a\nholder of the related capital securities by us\nin connection with a direct action. The\nholders of at least 25% in aggregate\nliquidation amount of any series of\noutstanding capital securities may, by giving\nnotice in writing to us and the subordinated\ndebt trustee, accelerate the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities with respect to\nsuch series upon the occurrence and during the\ncontinuance of an event of default under the\nsubordinated debt indenture with respect to\nsuch subordinated debt securities (other than\nan event of default arising from our filing\nfor bankruptcy or the 29\n\noccurrence of other events of bankruptcy,\ninsolvency or reorganization relating to us),\nif the holders of the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities or the\nsubordinated debt trustee have not done so.\nSee \u0093\u0097 Events of Default; Notice\u0094 above for a\ndescription of the events of default under the\nsubordinated debt indenture. The holders of a\nmajority in liquidation amount of all\noutstanding capital securities of a series\nmay, on behalf of all holders of that series,\nwaive any past default under the subordinated\ndebt indenture with respect to the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities,\nexcept any default in the payment of\nprincipal, premium or interest with respect to\nthose debt securities or a non-paymentdefault\nwith respect to a provision of that\nsubordinated debt indenture that cannot be\nmodified without the consent of the holder of\neach of those debt securities affected. The\nholders of related capital securities will not\nbe able to exercise directly any remedies or\ntake any action available to the holders of\nthe corresponding subordinated debt securities\nother than those set forth in the three\npreceding paragraphs. Interest Payment Dates\nand Record Dates The provisions relating to\ninterest payment dates and record dates in\nrespect of the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities will be amended to be consistent\nwith corresponding provisions relating to the\ncapital securities, as set forth in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. Guarantees\nand Expense Agreements The following\ndescription summarizes the material provisions\nof the guarantees and the agreements as to\nexpenses and liabilities. This description is\nnot complete and is subject to, and is\nqualified in its entirety by reference to, all\nof the provisions of each guarantee and each\nexpense agreement, including the definitions\ntherein, and the Trust Indenture Act. The form\nof the guarantee and the expense agreement\nhave been filed as an exhibit to our\nregistration statement. Reference in this\nsummary to capital securities means the\ncapital securities issued by the related\nIssuer Trust to which a guarantee or expense\nagreement relates. Whenever particular defined\nterms of the guarantees or expense agreements\nare referred to in this prospectus or in a\nprospectus supplement, those defined terms are\nincorporated in this prospectus or the\nprospectus supplement by reference. The\nGuarantees A guarantee will be executed and\ndelivered by us at the same time each Issuer\nTrust issues its capital securities. Each\nguarantee is for the benefit of the holders\nfrom time to time of the capital securities.\nThe Bank of New York Mellon will act as\nindenture trustee (referred to below as the\n\u0093guarantee trustee\u0094) under each guarantee for\nthe purposes of compliance with the Trust\nIndenture Act and each guarantee will be\nqualified as an indenture under the Trust\nIndenture Act. The guarantee trustee will hold\neach guarantee for the benefit of the holders\nof the related Issuer Trust\u0092s capital\nsecurities. We will irrevocably and\nunconditionally agree to pay in full on a\nsubordinated basis, to the extent described\nbelow, the guarantee payments (as defined\nbelow) to the holders of the capital\nsecurities, as and when due, regardless of any\ndefense that the Issuer Trust may have or\nassert other than the defense of payment. The\nfollowing payments or distributions with\nrespect to the capital securities, to the\nextent not paid by or on behalf of the related\nIssuer Trust (referred to as the \u0093guarantee\npayments\u0094), will be subject to the related\nguarantee:\n                                              \n      any accumulated and unpaid              \n      distributions required to be paid on    \n      the capital securities, to the extent   \n      that the Issuer Trust                   \n      has funds legally and immediately       \n      available to pay them;                  \n                                              \n30\n                                              \n      any redemption price required to be     \n      paid on the capital securities, to the  \n      extent that the Issuer Trust has funds  \n      legally                                 \n      and immediately available to pay it;    \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      upon a voluntary or involuntary         \n      termination, winding up or liquidation  \n      of the Issuer Trust (unless the         \n      corresponding                           \n      subordinated debt securities are        \n      distributed to holders of such capital  \n      securities in exchange for their        \n      capital securities), the lesser of:     \n                                              \n                                              \n      the liquidation distribution for the    \n      capital securities; and                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      the amount of assets of the Issuer      \n      Trust remaining available for           \n      distribution to holders of capital      \n      securities after                        \n      satisfaction of liabilities to          \n      creditors of the Issuer Trust as        \n      required by applicable law.             \n                                              \nOur obligation to make a guarantee payment may\nbe satisfied by direct payment of the required\namounts by us to the holders of the applicable\ncapital securities or by causing the Issuer\nTrust to pay these amounts to the holders.\nEach guarantee will be an irrevocable and\nunconditional guarantee on a subordinated\nbasis of the related Issuer Trust\u0092s\nobligations under the capital securities, but\nwill apply only to the extent that the related\nIssuer Trust has funds sufficient to make such\npayments, and is not a guarantee of\ncollection. See \u0093\u0097 Status of the Guarantees\u0094\nbelow. If and to the extent we do not make\npayments on the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities held by the Issuer Trust, the\nIssuer Trust will not be able to make payments\non the capital securities and will not have\nfunds available to do so. Each guarantee\nconstitutes an unsecured obligation of ours\nand will rank subordinate and junior in right\nof payment to all of our senior indebtedness.\nSee \u0093\u0097 Status of the Guarantees\u0094 below.\nBecause we are a holding company, our right to\nparticipate in any distribution of assets of\nany subsidiary upon such subsidiary\u0092s\nliquidation or reorganization or otherwise is\nsubject to the prior claims of creditors of\nthat subsidiary, except to the extent we may\nourselves be recognized as a creditor of that\nsubsidiary. Accordingly, our obligations under\nthe guarantees will be effectively\nsubordinated to all existing and future\nliabilities of our subsidiaries, and claimants\nshould look only to our assets for payments.\nExcept as otherwise provided in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, the guarantees do not\nlimit the incurrence or issuance of other\nsecured or unsecured debt of ours, including\nsenior indebtedness, whether under the\nsubordinated debt indenture, any other\nexisting debt indenture or any other indenture\nthat we may enter into in the future or\notherwise. We have, through the applicable\nguarantee, the applicable trust agreement, the\napplicable series of corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities, the subordinated\ndebt indenture and the applicable expense\nagreement, taken together, fully, irrevocably\nand unconditionally guaranteed all of the\nIssuer Trust\u0092s obligations under the related\ncapital securities. No single document\nstanding alone or operating in conjunction\nwith fewer than all of the other documents\nconstitutes a guarantee. It is only the\ncombined operation of these documents that has\nthe effect of providing a full, irrevocable\nand unconditional guarantee of an Issuer\nTrust\u0092s obligations under its capital\nsecurities. See \u0093Relationship Among the\nCapital Securities and the Related\nInstruments\u0094 below. Status of the Guarantees\nEach guarantee will constitute an unsecured\nobligation of ours and will be subordinated in\nright of payment to all of our senior\nindebtedness in the same manner as the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities.\nSee \u0093Corresponding Subordinated Debt\nSecurities \u0097 Subordination\u0094 above. Each\nguarantee will constitute a guarantee of\npayment and not of collection ( i.e., the\nguaranteed party may institute a legal\nproceeding directly against us to enforce its\nrights under the guarantee without first\ninstituting a legal proceeding against any\nother person or entity). Each guarantee will\nbe 31\n\nheld for the benefit of the holders of the\nrelated capital securities. Each guarantee\nwill not be discharged except by payment of\nthe guarantee payments in full to the extent\nnot paid by the Issuer Trust or upon\ndistribution to the holders of the capital\nsecurities of the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities. None of the guarantees places\na limitation on the amount of additional\nsenior indebtedness that may be incurred by\nus. We expect from time to time to incur\nadditional indebtedness constituting senior\nindebtedness. Amendments and Assignment Except\nwith respect to any changes which do not\nmaterially adversely affect the material\nrights of holders of the related capital\nsecurities (in which case no vote of the\nholders will be required), no guarantee may be\namended without the prior approval of the\nholders of a majority of the related\noutstanding capital securities. The manner of\nobtaining any such approval will be as\ndescribed above under \u0093\u0097 Voting Rights;\nAmendment of Each Trust Agreement\u0094. All\nguarantees and agreements contained in each\nguarantee will bind our successors, assigns,\nreceivers, trustees and representatives and\nwill inure to the benefit of the holders of\nthe related capital securities then\noutstanding. We may not assign our obligations\nunder the guarantees except in connection with\na consolidation, merger or amalgamation, or\nsale of all or substantially all our assets,\ninvolving us that is permitted under the terms\nof the subordinated debt indenture. Events of\nDefault An event of default under each\nguarantee will occur upon our failure to\nperform any of our payment obligations under\nthe guarantee or to perform any non-\npaymentobligations if this non-paymentdefault\nremains unremedied for 30 days. The holders of\na majority of the related capital securities\nthen outstanding have the right to direct the\ntime, method and place of conducting any\nproceeding for any remedy available to the\nguarantee trustee in respect of the guarantee\nor to direct the exercise of any trust or\npower conferred upon the guarantee trustee\nunder the guarantee. We, as guarantor, are\nrequired to file annually with the guarantee\ntrustee a certificate as to whether or not we\nare in compliance with all the conditions and\ncovenants applicable to us under the\nguarantee. Information Concerning the\nGuarantee Trustee The guarantee trustee, other\nthan during the occurrence and continuance of\na default by us in performance of any\nguarantee, undertakes to perform only those\nduties specifically set forth in each\nguarantee and, after default with respect to\nany guarantee, must exercise the same degree\nof care and skill as a prudent person would\nexercise or use in the conduct of his or her\nown affairs. Subject to this provision, the\nguarantee trustee is under no obligation to\nexercise any of the powers vested in it by any\nguarantee at the request of any holder of any\ncapital securities unless it is offered\nreasonable indemnity against the costs,\nexpenses and liabilities that might be\nincurred as a result. Termination of the\nGuarantees Each guarantee will terminate and\nbe of no further force and effect upon:\n                                              \n      the guarantee payments having been      \n      paid in full by us, the trust or both;  \n      or                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      the distribution of corresponding       \n      subordinated debt securities to the     \n      holders of the related capital          \n      securities in exchange                  \n      for their capital securities.           \n                                              \nEach guarantee will continue to be effective\nor will be reinstated, as the case may be, if\nat any time any holder of the related capital\nsecurities must restore payment of any sums\npaid under the 32\n\ncapital securities or the guarantee in\nconnection with a bankruptcy, insolvency, or\nsimilar proceeding involving the Issuer Trust.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nEach guarantee will be governed by and\nconstrued in accordance with the laws of the\nState of New York.\n\nThe Expense Agreements\n\nPursuant to the expense agreement that will be\nentered into by us under each trust agreement,\nwe will irrevocably and unconditionally\nguarantee to each\nperson or entity to whom the Issuer Trust\nbecomes indebted or liable the full payment of\nany costs, expenses or liabilities of the\nIssuer Trust, other than obligations of the\nIssuer Trust to pay to the holders of any\ncapital securities or other\nsimilar interests in the Issuer Trust the\namounts owed to holders pursuant to the terms\nof the capital securities or other similar\ninterests, as the case may be. The expense\nagreement will be enforceable by third\nparties.\n\nOur obligations under each expense agreement\nwill be subordinated in right of payment to\nthe same extent as each guarantee. Our\nobligations under each\nexpense agreement will be subject to\nprovisions regarding amendment, termination,\nassignment, succession and governing law\nsimilar to those applicable to each guarantee.\n\nRelationship Among the Capital Securities and\nthe Related Instruments\n\nThe following description of the relationship\namong the capital securities, the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities,\nthe relevant expense\nagreement and the relevant guarantee is not\ncomplete and is subject to, and is qualified\nin its entirety by reference to, each trust\nagreement, the subordinated debt indenture and\nthe form of guarantee, each of which is\nincorporated as an exhibit to\nour SEC registration statement, and the Trust\nIndenture Act.\n\nFull and Unconditional Guarantee\n\nPayments of distributions and other amounts\ndue on the capital securities (to the extent\nthe related Issuer Trust has funds available\nfor the payment of\nsuch distributions) are irrevocably guaranteed\nby us as described above under \u0093\u0097 Guarantees\nand Expense Agreements \u0097 The Guarantees\u0094.\nTaken together, our obligations under each\nseries of corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities, the subordinated debt indenture,\nthe related trust agreement, the related\nexpense agreement, and the related guarantee\nprovide, in the aggregate, a full, irrevocable\nand unconditional guarantee of payments of\ndistributions and other\namounts due on the related capital securities.\nNo single document standing alone or operating\nin conjunction with fewer than all of the\nother documents constitutes a guarantee. It is\nonly the combined operation of these documents\nthat has the effect\nof providing a full, irrevocable and\nunconditional guarantee of the Issuer Trust\u0092s\nobligations under the related capital\nsecurities. If and to the extent that we do\nnot make payments on any series of\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities,\nthe Issuer Trust will not pay distributions or\nother amounts due on its related capital\nsecurities. The guarantees do not cover\npayment of any amounts when the related Issuer\nTrust does not have sufficient funds to pay\nsuch amounts. In such an\nevent, the remedy of a holder of any capital\nsecurities is to institute a legal proceeding\ndirectly against us pursuant to the terms of\nthe subordinated debt indenture for\nenforcement of our obligations under the\ncorresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities. Our obligations under each\nguarantee are subordinate and junior in right\nof payment to all of our senior indebtedness.\n\n33\n\nIf we make payment on the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities and the relevant\nIssuer Trust has funds available to make\npayments on its related capital securities but\nfails to do so, a holder of such capital\nsecurities may begin a legal proceeding\nagainst us to enforce our obligations under\nthe related guarantee to make these payments\nor to cause the Issuer Trust to make these\npayments. In the event an Issuer Trust\nreceives payments on the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities, but these funds\nare available for payment on the related\ncapital securities only after claims made by\ncreditors of the trust are paid, we would be\nobligated under the related expense agreement\nto pay those claims. Sufficiency of Payments\nAs long as payments of interest and other\npayments are made when due on each series of\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities,\nsuch payments will be sufficient to cover\ndistributions and other payments due on the\nrelated capital securities, primarily because:\n                                              \n      the aggregate principal amount of each  \n      series of corresponding subordinated    \n      debt securities will be equal to the    \n      sum of the                              \n      aggregate stated liquidation amount of  \n      the related capital securities and      \n      related trust common securities;        \n                                              \n                                              \n      the interest rate and interest and      \n      other payment dates on each series of   \n      corresponding subordinated debt         \n      securities will                         \n      match the distribution rate and         \n      distribution and other payment dates    \n      for the related capital securities;     \n                                              \n                                              \n      we will pay, under the related expense  \n      agreement, for all and any costs,       \n      expenses and liabilities of the Issuer  \n      Trust                                   \n      except the Issuer Trust\u0092s obligations    \n      to holders of its capital securities    \n      under the capital securities; and       \n                                              \n                                              \n      each trust agreement provides that the  \n      Issuer Trust will not engage in any     \n      activity that is inconsistent with the  \n      limited                                 \n      purposes of such Issuer Trust.          \n                                              \nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in\nthe subordinated debt indenture, we have the\nright to set-offany payment we are otherwise\nrequired to make under the subordinated debt\nindenture with a payment we make under the\nrelated guarantee. Enforcement Rights of\nHolders of Capital Securities A holder of any\nrelated capital security may, to the extent\npermissible under applicable law, institute a\nlegal proceeding directly against us to\nenforce its rights under the subordinated debt\nindenture or the related guarantee without\nfirst instituting a legal proceeding against\nthe guarantee trustee, the related Issuer\nTrust or any other person or entity. A default\nor event of default under any of our senior\nindebtedness would not constitute a default or\nevent of default with respect to any series of\ncapital securities or the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities. In the event of\npayment defaults under, or acceleration of, or\ndefaults that permit acceleration of, our\nsenior indebtedness, or acceleration of the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities,\nthe subordination provisions of the\nsubordinated debt indenture provide that no\npayments may be made in respect of the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities\nuntil the senior indebtedness has been paid in\nfull or any payment default has been cured or\nwaived. Limited Purpose of Issuer Trusts Each\nIssuer Trust\u0092s capital securities evidence a\npreferred and undivided beneficial interest in\nthe Issuer Trust, and each Issuer Trust exists\nfor the sole purpose of issuing its capital\nsecurities and trust common securities and\ninvesting the proceeds thereof in\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities 34\n\nand engaging in only those other activities\nnecessary or incidental thereto. A principal\ndifference between the rights of a holder of a\ncapital security and a holder of the\ncorresponding\nsubordinated debt security is that a holder of\na corresponding subordinated debt security is\nentitled to receive from us the principal\namount of and interest accrued on\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities\nheld, while a holder of capital\nsecurities is entitled to receive\ndistributions from the Issuer Trust (or from\nus under the applicable guarantee) if and to\nthe extent the Issuer Trust has funds\navailable for the payment of such\ndistributions.\n\nRights Upon Dissolution\n\nUpon any voluntary or\ninvoluntary dissolution of any Issuer Trust\n(except in connection with the redemption of\nall capital securities), the holders of the\nrelated capital securities will be entitled to\nreceive a like amount of corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities\nin exchange for their capital securities,\nsubject to prior satisfaction of liabilities\nto creditors of the trust. If the property\ntrustee determines that a distribution of\nsubordinated debt securities is not practical,\nthe holders of capital\nsecurities will be entitled to receive a\nliquidation distribution out of the assets\nheld by the trust after satisfaction of those\nliabilities. See \u0093\u0097 Liquidation Distribution\nUpon Dissolution\u0094 above. Upon any voluntary or\ninvoluntary\nliquidation or bankruptcy of ours, the\nproperty trustee, as holder of the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities,\nwould be a subordinated creditor of ours,\nsubordinated in right of payment to all senior\nindebtedness as set forth in the\nsubordinated debt indenture, but entitled to\nreceive payment in full of principal and\ninterest, before any stockholders of ours\nreceive payments or distributions. Since we\nare the guarantor under each guarantee and\nhave agreed, under the related\nexpense agreement, to pay for all costs,\nexpenses and liabilities of each Issuer Trust\n(other than the Issuer Trust\u0092s obligations to\nthe holders of its capital securities), the\npositions of a holder of such capital\nsecurities and a holder of\nsuch corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities relative to other creditors and to\nour stockholders in the event of our\nliquidation or bankruptcy are expected to be\nsubstantially the same.\n\nNotices\n\nNotices to be given to holders of a global\ncapital security will be given only to the\ndepositary, in accordance with its applicable\npolicies as in effect from time to time.\nNotices to be given to holders of any capital\nsecurities not in global form will be sent by\nmail to the respective\naddresses of the holders as they appear in the\ntrustee\u0092s records, and will be deemed given\nwhen mailed. Neither the failure to give any\nnotice to a particular holder, nor any defect\nin a notice given to a particular holder, will\naffect the\nsufficiency of any notice given to another\nholder.\n\nBook-entry and other indirect owners should\nconsult their banks or brokers for information\non how they will receive notices.\n\n35\n\nLEGAL OWNERSHIP AND BOOK-ENTRY ISSUANCE\n\nIn this section, we describe special\nconsiderations that will apply to registered\nsecurities issued in global \u0097i.e.,\nbook-entry \u0097 form. First we describe the\ndifference between legal ownership and\nindirect ownership of registered securities.\nThen we describe special provisions that apply\nto global securities.\n\nWho Is the Legal Owner of a Registered\nSecurity?\n\nEach capital security in registered form will\nbe represented either by a certificate issued\nin definitive form to a particular investor or\nby one or more\nglobal securities representing the entire\nissuance of securities. We refer to those who\nhave capital securities registered in their\nown names, on the books that we or the trustee\nmaintain for this purpose, as the \u0093holders\u0094 of\nthose capital\nsecurities. These persons are the legal\nholders of the capital securities. We refer to\nthose who, indirectly through others, own\nbeneficial interests in capital securities\nthat are not registered in their own names as\nindirect owners of those\ncapital securities. As we discuss below,\nindirect owners are not legal holders, and\ninvestors in capital securities issued in\nbook-entry form or in street name will be\nindirect owners.\n\nBook-Entry Owners\n\nThe Issuer Trusts will issue each\ncapital security in book-entry form only. This\nmeans capital securities will be represented\nby one or more global securities registered in\nthe name of a financial institution that holds\nthem as depositary on behalf of other\nfinancial institutions\nthat participate in the depositary\u0092s book-\nentry system. These participating\ninstitutions, in turn, hold beneficial\ninterests in the capital securities on behalf\nof themselves or their customers.\n\nFor capital securities issued in global form,\nthe relevant Issuer Trust will recognize only\nthe depositary as the holder of the capital\nsecurities and\nthe Issuer Trust will make all payments on the\ncapital securities to the depositary. The\ndepositary passes along the payments it\nreceives to its participants, which in turn\npass the payments along to their customers who\nare the beneficial owners.\nThe depositary and its participants do so\nunder agreements they have made with one\nanother or with their customers; they are not\nobligated to do so under the terms of the\ncapital securities.\n\nAs a result, investors will not own capital\nsecurities directly. Instead, they will own\nbeneficial interests in a global security,\nthrough a bank,\nbroker or other financial institution that\nparticipates in the depositary\u0092s book-entry\nsystem or holds an interest through a\nparticipant. As long as the capital securities\nare issued in global form, investors will be\nindirect owners, and not\nholders, of the securities.\n\nStreet Name Owners\n\nIn the future an Issuer Trust may terminate a\nglobal security and issue capital securities\nin non-global form. In\nthat case, investors may choose to hold their\ncapital securities in their own names or in\nstreet name. Capital securities held by an\ninvestor in street name would be registered in\nthe name of a bank, broker or other financial\ninstitution that the\ninvestor chooses, and the investor would hold\nonly a beneficial interest in those capital\nsecurities through an account he or she\nmaintains at that institution.\n\nFor capital securities held in street name,\nthe relevant Issuer Trust will recognize only\nthe intermediary banks, brokers and other\nfinancial\ninstitutions in whose names the capital\nsecurities are registered as the holders of\nthose capital securities and the Issuer Trust\nwill make all payments on those capital\nsecurities to them. These institutions pass\nalong the payments they receive to\ntheir customers who are the beneficial owners,\nbut only because they agree to do so in their\ncustomer agreements or because they are\nlegally required to do so. Investors who hold\ncapital securities in street name will be\nindirect owners, not\nholders, of those securities.\n\n36\n\nLegal Holders Our obligations, the obligations\nof the Issuer Trusts, as well as the\nobligations of the trustee under the indenture\nand any other third parties employed by us or\nthe trustee, run only to the holders of the\ncapital securities. Neither we nor the Issuer\nTrusts have obligations to investors who hold\nbeneficial interests in global securities, in\nstreet name or by any other indirect means.\nThis will be the case whether an investor\nchooses to be an indirect owner of a capital\nsecurity or has no choice because the relevant\nIssuer Trust is issuing the capital securities\nonly in global form. For example, once an\nIssuer Trust makes a payment or gives a notice\nto the holder, the Issuer Trust has no further\nresponsibility for that payment or notice even\nif that holder is required, under agreements\nwith depositary participants or customers or\nby law, to pass it along to the indirect\nowners but does not do so. Similarly, if the\nIssuer Trust wants to obtain the approval of\nthe holders for any purpose \u0097 e.g., to amend\nthe amended and restated trust declaration or\nto relieve us of the consequences of a default\nor of our obligation to comply with a\nparticular provision of the indenture \u0097 the\nIssuer Trust would seek the approval only from\nthe holders, and not the indirect owners, of\nthe capital securities. Whether and how the\nholders contact the indirect owners is up to\nthe holders. Special Considerations for\nIndirect Owners If you hold capital securities\nthrough a bank, broker or other financial\ninstitution, either in book-entry form or in\nstreet name, you should check with your own\ninstitution to find out:\n                                              \n      how it handles securities payments and  \n      notices;                                \n                                              \n                                           \n      whether it imposes fees or charges;  \n                                           \n                                              \n      how it would handle a request for the   \n      holders\u0092 consent, if ever required;      \n                                              \n                                              \n      whether and how you can instruct it to  \n      send you capital securities registered  \n      in your own name so you can be a        \n      holder, if                              \n      that is permitted in the future;        \n                                              \n                                              \n      how it would exercise rights under the  \n      capital securities if there were a      \n      default or other event triggering the   \n      need for                                \n      holders to act to protect their         \n      interests; and                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      if the capital securities are in        \n      book-entry form, how the depositary\u0092s    \n      rules and procedures will affect these  \n      matters.                                \n                                              \nWhat Is a Global Security? The Issuer Trusts\nwill issue each capital security in book-entry\nform only. Each capital security issued in\nbook-entry form will be represented by a\nglobal security that the relevant Issuer Trust\ndeposits with and registers in the name of one\nor more financial institutions or clearing\nsystems, or their nominees, which we select. A\nfinancial institution or clearing system that\nthe Issuer Trust selects for any capital\nsecurity for this purpose is called the\n\u0093depositary\u0094 for that capital security. The\ninitial depositary will be The Depository\nTrust Company, New York, New York, which is\nknown as \u0093DTC.\u0094 Investors may also hold\nbeneficial interests in a global security\nthrough Euroclear Bank SA/NV, which is known\nas \u0093Euroclear\u0094 or Clearstream Banking, soci\u00e9t\u00e9\nanonyme, which is known as \u0093Clearstream,\u0094 as\nDTC participants. A global security may not be\ntransferred to or registered in the name of\nanyone other than the depositary or its\nnominee, unless special termination situations\narise. We describe those situations below\nunder \u0093\u0097 Special Situations When a Global\nSecurity Will Be Terminated.\u0094 If termination\noccurs, the relevant Issuer Trust may issue\nthe capital securities through another book-\nentry clearing system or the capital\nsecurities may no longer be held through any\nbook-entry clearing system. 37\n\nThe depositary, or its nominee, will be the\nsole registered owner and holder of all\ncapital securities represented by a global\nsecurity, and investors will be permitted to\nown only indirect interests in a global\nsecurity. Indirect interests must be held by\nmeans of an account with a broker, bank or\nother financial institution that in turn has\nan account with the depositary or with another\ninstitution that does. Thus, an investor whose\ncapital security is represented by a global\nsecurity will not be a holder of the capital\nsecurity, but only an indirect owner of an\ninterest in the global security. Special\nConsiderations for Global Securities As an\nindirect owner, an investor\u0092s rights relating\nto a global security will be governed by the\naccount rules of the depositary and those of\nthe investor\u0092s financial institution or other\nintermediary through which it holds its\ninterest ( e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream, if\nDTC is the depositary), as well as general\nlaws relating to securities transfers. The\nIssuer Trusts do not recognize this type of\ninvestor or any intermediary as a holder of\ncapital securities and instead deal only with\nthe depositary that holds the global security.\nBecause the capital securities will be issued\nonly in the form of a global security, an\ninvestor should be aware of the following:\n                                              \n      An investor cannot cause the capital    \n      securities to be registered in his or   \n      her own name, and cannot obtain         \n      non-global certificates for his or her  \n      interest in the capital securities,     \n      except in the special situations we     \n      describe below;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      An investor will be an indirect holder  \n      and must look to his or her own bank    \n      or broker for payments on the capital   \n      securities and protection of his or     \n      her legal rights relating to the        \n      capital securities, as we describe      \n      above under \u0093\u0097 Who Is the Legal Owner of  \n      a Registered Security?\u0094;                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      An investor may not be able to sell     \n      interests in the capital securities to  \n      some insurance companies and other      \n      institutions                            \n      that are required by law to own         \n      securities in non-book-entry form;      \n                                              \n                                              \n      An investor may not be able to pledge   \n      his or her interest in a global         \n      security in circumstances where         \n      certificates                            \n      representing the capital securities     \n      must be delivered to the lender or      \n      other beneficiary of the pledge in      \n      order for the pledge to be effective;   \n                                              \n                                              \n      The depositary\u0092s policies will govern    \n      payments, deliveries, transfers,        \n      exchanges, notices and other matters    \n      relating                                \n      to an investor\u0092s interest in a global    \n      security, and those policies may        \n      change from time to time. We, the       \n      Issuer Trusts and the trustees will     \n      have no responsibility for any aspect   \n      of the depositary\u0092s policies, actions    \n      or records of                           \n      ownership interests in a global         \n      security. We, the Issuer Trusts and     \n      the trustees also do not supervise the  \n      depositary in any way;                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      The depositary will require that those  \n      who purchase and sell interests in a    \n      global security within its book-entry   \n      system                                  \n      use immediately available funds and     \n      your broker or bank may require you to  \n      do so as well; and                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      Financial institutions that             \n      participate in the depositary\u0092s          \n      book-entry system and through which an  \n      investor holds its                      \n      interest in the global securities,      \n      directly or indirectly, may also have   \n      their own policies affecting payments,  \n      deliveries, transfers, exchanges,       \n      notices and other matters relating to   \n      the global securities, and those        \n      policies may change from time to        \n      time. For example, if you hold an       \n      interest in a global security through   \n      Euroclear or Clearstream, when DTC is   \n      the depositary, Euroclear or            \n      Clearstream, as applicable, will        \n      require those who purchase and sell     \n      interests in that global security       \n      through                                 \n      them to use immediately available       \n      funds and comply with other policies    \n      and procedures, including deadlines     \n      for giving                              \n                                              \n38\n                                              \n  instructions as to transactions that are    \n  to be effected on a particular day. There   \n  may be more than one financial              \n  intermediary in the chain of ownership for  \n  an investor. The Issuer Trusts do not       \n  monitor and are not responsible for the     \n  policies or actions or records of           \n  ownership interests of any of those         \n  intermediaries.                             \n                                              \nSpecial Situations When a Global Security Will\nBe Terminated In a few special situations\ndescribed below, a global security will be\nterminated and interests in it will be\nexchanged for certificates in non-globalform\nrepresenting the capital securities it\nrepresented. After that exchange, the choice\nof whether to hold the capital securities\ndirectly or in street name will be up to the\ninvestor. Investors must consult their own\nbanks or brokers to find out how to have their\ninterests in a global security transferred on\ntermination to their own names, so that they\nwill be holders. We have described the rights\nof holders and street name investors above\nunder \u0093\u0097 Who Is the Legal Owner of a\nRegistered Security?\u0094. The special situations\nfor termination of a global security are as\nfollows:\n                                              \n      if the depositary notifies us and the   \n      Issuer Trust that it is unwilling,      \n      unable or no longer qualified to        \n      continue as                             \n      depositary for that global security     \n      and we do not appoint another           \n      institution to act as depositary        \n      within 60 days;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      if we notify the depositary that we     \n      wish to terminate that global security  \n      and we do not appoint another           \n      institution to act                      \n      as depositary within 60 days; or        \n                                              \n                                              \n      if an event of default has occurred     \n      with regard to the corresponding        \n      subordinated debt securities under the  \n      indenture and                           \n      has not been cured or waived.           \n                                              \nDTC\u0092s current rules provide that it would\nnotify its participants of a request by us or\nthe Issuer Trust to terminate a global\nsecurity, but will only withdraw beneficial\ninterests from the global security at the\nrequest of each DTC participant. If a global\nsecurity is terminated, only the depositary,\nand not we, the Issuer Trust or the trustees\nis responsible for deciding the names of the\ninstitutions in whose names the capital\nsecurities represented by the global security\nwill be registered and, therefore, who will be\nthe holders of those capital securities.\nConsiderations Relating to Euroclear and\nClearstream Euroclear and Clearstream are\nsecurities clearing systems in Europe. Both\nsystems clear and settle securities\ntransactions between their participants\nthrough electronic, book-entry delivery of\nsecurities against payment. Euroclear and\nClearstream may be depositaries for a global\nsecurity. In addition, Euroclear and\nClearstream may hold interests in a global\nsecurity as participants in DTC. As long as\nany global security is held by Euroclear or\nClearstream as depositary, you may hold an\ninterest in the global security only through\nan organization that participates, directly or\nindirectly, in Euroclear or Clearstream. If\nEuroclear or Clearstream is the depositary for\na global security and there is no depositary\nin the United States, you will not be able to\nhold interests in that global security through\nany securities clearance system in the United\nStates. Payments, deliveries, transfers,\nexchanges, notices and other matters relating\nto the capital securities made through\nEuroclear or Clearstream must comply with the\nrules and procedures of those 39\n\nsystems. Those clearing systems could change\ntheir rules and procedures at any time.\nNeither we nor the Issuer Trust have control\nover those systems or their participants, and\nneither we nor the\nIssuer Trust take responsibility for their\nactivities. Transactions between participants\nin Euroclear or Clearstream, on one hand, and\nparticipants in DTC, on the other hand, when\nDTC is the depositary, would also be subject\nto DTC\u0092s rules and\nprocedures.\n\nSpecial Timing Considerations for Transactions\nin Euroclear and Clearstream\n\nInvestors will be able to make and receive\nthrough Euroclear and Clearstream payments,\ndeliveries, transfers, exchanges, notices and\nother transactions\ninvolving any capital securities held through\nthose clearing systems only on days when those\nsystems are open for business. Those clearing\nsystems may not be open for business on days\nwhen banks, brokers and other institutions are\nopen for business\nin the United States.\n\nIn addition, because of time-zone differences,\nU.S. investors who hold their interests in the\ncapital securities through\nthese clearing systems and wish to transfer\ntheir interests, or to receive or make a\npayment or delivery or exercise any other\nright with respect to their interests, on a\nparticular day may find that the transaction\nwill not be effected until the\nnext business day in Luxembourg or Brussels,\nas applicable. Thus, investors who wish to\nexercise rights that expire on a particular\nday may need to act before the expiration\ndate. In addition, investors who hold their\ninterests through both DTC and\nEuroclear or Clearstream may need to make\nspecial arrangements to finance any purchases\nor sales of their interests between the U.S.\nand European clearing systems, and those\ntransactions may settle later than would be\nthe case for transactions\nwithin one clearing system.\n\n40\n\nCONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO CAPITAL SECURITIES\n\nAn investment in the capital securities\ninvolves a number of risks. You should\ncarefully review the following risk factors\nand the other information contained in this\nprospectus, in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement to this prospectus, and in the\ndocuments incorporated by reference in this\nprospectus, including the description of\ninvestment risks relating to an investment in\nthe securities of The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. described under \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 in Part I,\nItem 1A or our Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2020,\nbefore deciding whether this investment is\nsuitable for you.\n\nYou Are Making an Investment Decision With\nRegard to the Subordinated Debt Securities\n\nAs Well As the Capital Securities\n\nEach Issuer\nTrust will rely on the payments it receives on\nthe corresponding subordinated debt securities\nto fund all payments on its capital\nsecurities. In addition, each Issuer Trust may\ndistribute the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities in exchange\nfor its capital securities upon its\ndissolution and liquidation. Accordingly, you\nshould carefully review the information in\nthis prospectus regarding both of these\nsecurities.\n\nPayments on the Capital Securities Are\nDependent on Our Payments\n\non the Subordinated Debt Securities\n\nThe\nability of the Issuer Trusts timely to pay\ndistributions on the capital securities and to\npay the liquidation amount is dependent upon\nour making the related payments on the\nsubordinated debt securities when due.\n\nIf we default on our obligation to pay\nprincipal of or any premium or interest on the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities,\nthe Issuer Trusts will\nnot have sufficient funds to pay distributions\nor the liquidation amount on the related\ncapital securities. As a result, you will not\nbe able to rely upon the guarantee for payment\nof these amounts. You or the property trustee\nof the Issuer Trust\nmay, however, sue us to enforce the rights of\nsuch trust under the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities. For more\ninformation, please refer to \u0093Description of\nCapital Securities and Related Instruments \u0097\nCorresponding Subordinated\nDebt Securities \u0097Enforcement of Certain Rights\nby Holders of Capital Securities\u0094 and\n\u0093Description of Capital Securities and Related\nInstruments \u0097 Relationship Among the Capital\nSecurities and the Related Instruments \u0097\nEnforcement Rights of Holders of Capital\nSecurities\u0094 above.\n\nOur Obligations Will Be Deeply Subordinated,\nand We Will Pay\n\nOur Other Debt Obligations Before We Pay You\n\nOur obligations under the guarantee and under\nthe corresponding subordinated debt securities\nwill be unsecured and rank subordinate and\njunior in right\nof payment to all of our senior indebtedness,\nwhich includes nearly all of our existing and\nfuture indebtedness (including any\nsubordinated debt securities not issued to the\nIssuer Trusts and other subordinated debt).\nThis means that we cannot make\nany payments on the subordinated debt\nsecurities or under the guarantee if certain\nevents of default have occurred under our\nsenior indebtedness. In the event of our\nbankruptcy or liquidation, our assets must be\nused to pay off our senior debt in\nfull before any payments may be made on the\nsubordinated debt securities or under the\nguarantee.\n\nNeither the subordinated debt indenture\ngoverning\nthe corresponding subordinated debt securities\nnor the trust agreement and the guarantee\nrelating to the capital securities will place\nany limitation on the nature or amount of\nadditional indebtedness that we, or our\nsubsidiaries, may incur in the\nfuture.\n\n41\n\nThe Subordinated Debt Securities and the\nGuarantee Will Be Effectively Subordinated\n\nto the Obligations of Our Subsidiaries\n\nWe are\na holding company that conducts substantially\nall of our operations through subsidiaries. As\na result, our ability to make payments on the\nsubordinated debt securities and the\nguarantees will depend primarily upon the\nreceipt of dividends and other\ndistributions from our subsidiaries. Many of\nour subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer,\nbank and insurance subsidiaries, are subject\nto laws that restrict dividend payments or\nauthorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce\nthe flow of funds from\nthose subsidiaries to us. Restrictions or\nregulatory action of that kind could impede\naccess to funds that we need to make payments\non our obligations, including debt\nobligations. Furthermore, we have guaranteed\nthe payment obligations of\nGS&Co., Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Goldman\nSachs Bank (Europe) PLC, our regulated Irish\nBank, subject to certain exceptions, and have\npledged significant assets to Goldman Sachs\nBank USA to support our obligations to it.\nThese guarantees may\nrequire us to provide substantial funds or\nassets to our subsidiaries or their creditors\nand counterparties at a time when we are in\nneed of liquidity to fund our own obligations.\nIn addition, our right to participate in any\ndistribution of assets\nfrom any subsidiary, upon the subsidiary\u0092s\nliquidation or otherwise, is subject to the\nprior claims of creditors of that subsidiary,\nexcept to the extent that we are recognized as\na creditor of that subsidiary. As a result,\nthe subordinated\ndebt securities and the guarantees will be\neffectively subordinated to all existing and\nfuture liabilities of our subsidiaries. You\nshould look only to the assets of The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. as the source of payment for\nthe subordinated debt\nsecurities and the guarantees.\n\nOur Ability to Make Distributions on or Redeem\nthe Capital Securities Is Restricted\n\nFederal banking authorities will have the\nright to examine the trust and its activities\nbecause it is our subsidiary. Under certain\ncircumstances,\nincluding any determination that our\nrelationship to the Issuer Trusts would result\nin an unsafe and unsound banking practice,\nthese banking authorities have the authority\nto issue orders which could restrict the\ntrust\u0092s ability to make\ndistributions on or to redeem the capital\nsecurities.\n\nHolders Should Not Expect Us to Redeem the\nCorresponding\n\nSubordinated Debt Securities on Any Particular\nDate\n\nBy their terms, the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities may be redeemed by us at our\noption, either in whole or in part, at any\ntime or upon the\noccurrence of a tax event or investment\ncompany event as described under \u0093Description\nof Capital Securities and Related Instruments\n\u0097 Redemption or Exchange\u0094. Any decision we may\nmake at any time to propose a redemption of\nthe\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities\nwill depend, among other things, upon our\nevaluation of the overall level and quality of\nour capital components, considered in light of\nour risk exposures, earnings and growth\nstrategy, as well as general\nmarket conditions at such time. Our right to\nredeem the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities is subject to an important\nlimitation as described below. Accordingly,\ninvestors should not expect us to redeem the\ncorresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities on any particular date.\n\nWe may not redeem the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities without having\nreceived the prior approval of\nthe Federal Reserve Board under the current\ncapital guidelines applicable to us. We cannot\nassure you that the Federal Reserve Board will\napprove any redemption of the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities that we may\npropose. We understand\nthat the factors the Federal Reserve Board\nwill consider in evaluating a proposed\nredemption by a bank holding company include,\namong other things, the capital plans and\nstress tests submitted by the bank holding\ncompany, the bank holding\ncompany\u0092s ability to meet and exceed minimum\nregulatory capital ratios under stressed\nscenarios, its expected sources and uses of\ncapital over the planning horizon (generally a\nperiod of two\n\n42\n\nyears) under baseline and stressed scenarios,\nand any potential impact of changes to its\nbusiness plan and activities on its capital\nadequacy and liquidity, although the Federal\nReserve Board may\nchange these factors at any time.\n\nIf we are unable to redeem the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities, we will be\nunable to redeem the\ncapital securities. Accordingly, there could\nbe circumstances where we would wish to redeem\nor repurchase some or all of the capital\nsecurities or the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities and sufficient cash is\navailable for that purpose, but\nwe are restricted from doing so because we\nhave not been able to obtain approval from the\nFederal Reserve Board.\n\nThe Guarantees Only Guarantee Payments on the\nCapital Securities\n\nif the Issuer Trusts Have Cash Available\n\nIf we fail to make payments on the\nsubordinated debt securities, the Issuer\nTrusts will be unable to make the related\ndistribution, redemption or\nliquidation payments on the capital securities\nto you. In those circumstances, you cannot\nrely on the guarantees for payments of those\namounts. Instead, if we are in default under\nthe subordinated debt securities, you may rely\non the property\ntrustee of the applicable Issuer Trust to\nenforce the Issuer Trust\u0092s rights under the\nsubordinated debt securities or you may\ndirectly sue us or seek other remedies to\ncollect your pro rata share of the payments\nowed.\n\nYou Will Not Receive Timely Distributions If\nWe Elect to Defer Payments\n\nUnless otherwise provided in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, we may defer the\npayment of interest on the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities\nat any time up to a number of consecutive\ninterest periods that is specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, provided\nthat (1) no such extension period may extend\nbeyond the stated maturity date and (2) we are\nnot in default under\nthe subordinated debt indenture with respect\nto the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities (unless our default has not ripened\ninto a formal \u0093event of default\u0094). If there is\na deferral, the Issuer Trust also will defer\ndistributions on\nthe related capital securities. Before any\nextension period ends, we may elect to extend\nthe period further.\n\nAt the end of any extension period and\nupon the payment of all interest then accrued\nand unpaid, we may elect to begin a new\nextension period. There is no limitation on\nthe number of extension periods. Deferrals of\npayments during an extension period will not\nresult in a default or event\nof default. For further information on our\noption to defer payments, see \u0093Description of\nCapital Securities and Related Instruments \u0097\nCorresponding Subordinated Debt Securities \u0097\nOption to Defer Interest Payments\u0094 above.\n\nIf We Elect to Defer Interest Payments, You\nWill Have to Include Interest in Your Taxable\nIncome\n\nBefore You Receive the Money\n\nDuring an\nextension period, you would be required to\naccrue interest income for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes on your proportionate share of\nthe corresponding subordinated debt securities\nheld by an Issuer Trust, even if you are a\ncash basis taxpayer. As a\nresult, you would need to include this income\nin your gross income for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes in advance of the receipt of\ncash. You also would not receive the cash\nrelated to any accrued and unpaid interest\nincome from the trust if you\ndispose of the capital securities prior to the\nrecord date for the payment of distributions.\nFor further information, see \u0093United States\nTaxation \u0097 Interest Income and Original Issue\nDiscount\u0094 and \u0093United States Taxation \u0097\nSale or Redemption of Capital Securities\u0094\nbelow.\n\n43\n\nThe Market Price of the Capital Securities May\nNot Reflect Unpaid Interest, and You May\nSuffer a Loss If You Sell Them While Interest\nRemains Unpaid Because of our right to defer\ninterest payments on the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities, the market price\nof the related capital securities may be more\nvolatile than the market prices of similar\nsecurities that do not have this feature. We\ncurrently do not intend to exercise our right\nto defer payments of interest on the\nsubordinated debt securities. However, if we\nexercise our right to defer, the market price\nof the capital securities may decline.\nAccordingly, the capital securities that you\npurchase, whether in an offering made pursuant\nto a prospectus supplement or in the secondary\nmarket, or the subordinated debt securities\nthat you may receive on liquidation of the\ntrust, may trade at a discount to the price\nthat you paid. If you dispose of your capital\nsecurities before the record date for the\npayment of a distribution, then you will not\nreceive that distribution. However, you will\nbe required to include accrued but unpaid\ninterest on the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities through the date of the sale\nas ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes and to add the amount of the accrued\nbut unpaid interest to your tax basis in the\ncapital securities. Your increased tax basis\nin the capital securities will increase the\namount of any capital loss that you may have\notherwise realized on the sale. In general, an\nindividual taxpayer may offset only $3,000 of\ncapital losses against ordinary income during\nany year.

We May Redeem the Corresponding\nSubordinated Debt Securities Upon the\nOccurrence of Specified Tax or Regulatory\nEvents We may redeem the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities in whole at any\ntime within 90 days following the occurrence\nof specified tax or regulatory events,\nincluding:\n                                              \n      any change in tax laws or regulations   \n      (or any official interpretation) that   \n      poses a substantial risk that the       \n      related                                 \n      capital securities might lose their     \n      special tax treatment; and              \n                                              \n                                              \n      any change in laws or regulations (or   \n      any official interpretation) that       \n      poses a substantial risk that the       \n      relevant Issuer                         \n      Trust is or will be considered an       \n      \u0093investment company\u0094 that is required to  \n      be registered under the Investment      \n      Company Act.                            \n                                              \nIf we redeem the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities, the Issuer Trust will be\nrequired to redeem the related capital\nsecurities. Unless your prospectus supplement\nsays otherwise, you may not receive any\npremium upon redemption, and you may not be\nable to invest the redemption proceeds at a\nrate of return that equals or is higher than\nthe rate on your capital securities. For\nfurther information on redemption, see\n\u0093Description of Capital Securities and Related\nInstruments \u0097 Redemption or Exchange\u0094 above.\nEach Issuer Trust May Distribute the\nSubordinated Debt Securities In Exchange For\nthe Capital Securities, Which Could Affect the\nMarket Price and Could Be a Taxable Event We\nmay dissolve any Issuer Trust at any time.\nAfter satisfying its liabilities to its\ncreditors, the Issuer Trust may distribute the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities to\nthe holders of the related capital securities.\nFor further information, see \u0093Description of\nCapital Securities and Related Instruments \u0097\nLiquidation Distribution Upon Dissolution\u0094\nabove. We cannot predict the market prices for\ncapital securities or for subordinated debt\nsecurities that may be distributed in exchange\nfor capital securities. Accordingly, the\ncapital securities, or the subordinated debt\nsecurities that you may receive on liquidation\nof an Issuer Trust, may trade at a discount to\nthe price that you paid to purchase the\ncapital securities. 44\n\nUnder current U.S. federal income tax law and\nassuming, as we expect, that the amended and\nrestated\ntrust agreement for the relevant Issuer Trust\nwill contain substantially identical terms as\nthe form of amended and restated trust\nagreement attached as an exhibit to our\nregistration statement filed with the SEC, and\nthe relevant Issuer Trust will\nnot be classified as an association taxable as\na corporation, you will not be taxed if we\ndissolve the trust and the trust distributes\nsubordinated debt securities to you. However,\nif an Issuer Trust were to become taxed on the\nincome received or\naccrued on the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities due to a tax event, both you and\nthe Issuer Trust might be taxed on a\ndistribution of the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities by the trust. For further\ninformation, see \u0093United\nStates Taxation \u0097 Distribution of Subordinated\nDebt Securities to Holders of Capital\nSecurities Upon Liquidation of the Issuer\nTrusts\u0094 below.\n\nInvestors Will Not Control the Administration\nof the Issuer Trusts\n\nand Will Have Limited Voting Rights\n\nWe will\nhold all the common securities of each Issuer\nTrust. These securities give us the right to\ncontrol nearly all aspects of the\nadministration, operation or management of the\nIssuer Trust, including selection and removal\nof the administrative trustees.\nThe capital securities, on the other hand,\nwill generally have no voting rights. You will\nbe able to vote only on matters relating to\nthe modification of the terms of your capital\nsecurities or the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities, the\nacceleration of payments on those securities\nand waivers of related past defaults as\ndescribed in this prospectus. For further\ninformation, see \u0093Description of Capital\nSecurities and Related Instruments \u0097 Voting\nRights; Amendment of Each\nTrust Agreement\u0094 above.\n\nListing of the Capital Securities, If Any,\nDoes Not Guarantee Their Liquidity or Full\nValue\n\nWe may apply to list a series of capital\nsecurities on the NYSE or another exchange,\nbut are not required to do so. If listed,\ntrading in a series of\ncapital securities on the NYSE is expected to\ncommence within 30 days after the initial\ndelivery of the series. Although we expect the\nunderwriters to make a market in the capital\nsecurities prior to commencement of trading on\nthe NYSE, they are not\nobligated to do so. They may also discontinue\nthese market-making activities at any time\nwithout notice. We cannot assure the liquidity\nof the trading market for the capital\nsecurities.\n\nThe capital securities may trade at prices\nthat do not fully reflect the value of accrued\nand unpaid interest with respect to the\ncorresponding\nsubordinated debt securities. See \u0093United\nStates Taxation \u0097 Interest Income and Original\nIssue Discount\u0094 and \u0093\u0097 Sale or Redemption of\nCapital Securities\u0094 below for a discussion of\nthe United States federal income tax\nconsequences that may result from a taxable\ndisposition of the capital securities.\n\n45\n\nUNITED STATES TAXATION This section describes\nthe material United States federal income tax\nconsequences of the purchase, ownership and\ndisposition of certain capital securities that\nthe Issuer Trusts are offering. The material\nUnited States federal income tax consequences\nof owning capital securities that contain, or\nthat represent any corresponding subordinated\ndebt security that contains, any material term\nnot described in this prospectus will be\ndescribed in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement. This section is the opinion of\nSullivan & Cromwell LLP, United States tax\ncounsel to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. The\nfollowing discussion of the material U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences to the\npurchase, ownership and disposition of capital\nsecurities only addresses the tax consequences\nto a holder that acquires capital securities\non their original issue date at their original\noffering price and holds the capital\nsecurities as a capital asset for tax\npurposes.

These laws are subject to\nchange, possibly on a retroactive basis. If an\nentity or arrangement that is treated as a\npartnership for United States federal income\ntax purposes holds the capital securities, the\nUnited States federal income tax treatment of\na partner will generally depend on the status\nof the partner and the tax treatment of the\npartnership.

Please\nconsult your own tax advisor concerning the\nconsequences of owning the capital securities\nin your particular circumstances under the\nInternal Revenue Code and the laws of any\nother taxing jurisdiction. Classification of\nthe Issuer Trusts Under current law and\nassuming full compliance with the terms of an\namended trust agreement substantially in the\nform attached to this prospectus as an exhibit\nand the indenture, each Issuer Trust will not\nbe taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. As a result, you will be\nrequired to include in your gross income your\nproportional share of the interest income,\nincluding original issue discount, paid or\naccrued on the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities, whether or not the trust actually\ndistributes cash to you. United States Holders\nThis subsection describes the tax consequences\nto a United States holder. A holder of capital\nsecurities is a United States holder if such\nholder is a beneficial owner of a capital\nsecurity and is:\n                                              \n      a citizen or resident of the United     \n      States,                                 \n                                              \n47\n                               \n      a domestic corporation,  \n                               \n                                              \n      an estate whose income is subject to    \n      United States federal income tax        \n      regardless of its source, or            \n                                              \n                                              \n      a trust if a United States court can    \n      exercise primary supervision over the   \n      trust\u0092s administration and one or more   \n      United States persons are authorized    \n      to control all substantial decisions    \n      of the trust.                           \n                                              \nIf you are not a United States holder, this\nsubsection does not apply to you and you\nshould refer to \u0093\u0097 Non-United States Holders\u0094\nbelow. Interest Income and Original Issue\nDiscount Under Treasury regulations, an issuer\nand the Internal Revenue Service will ignore a\n\u0093remote\u0094 contingency that stated interest will\nnot be timely paid when determining whether a\ncorresponding subordinated debt security is\nissued with original issue discount. On the\ndate of this prospectus, we currently believe\nthat the likelihood of exercising our option\nto defer interest payments is remote because\nwe would be prohibited from making certain\ndistributions on our capital stock and\npayments on our indebtedness if we exercise\nthat option. Accordingly, we currently believe\nthat the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities will not be considered to be issued\nwith original issue discount at the time of\ntheir original issuance. However, if our\nbelief changes on the date any capital\nsecurity is issued, we will describe the\nrelevant U.S. federal income tax consequences\nin the applicable prospectus supplement. Under\nthese regulations, if we were to exercise our\noption to defer any payment of interest, the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities\nwould at that time be treated as issued with\noriginal issue discount, and all stated\ninterest on the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities would thereafter be treated as\noriginal issue discount as long as the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities\nremained outstanding. In that event, all of\nyour taxable interest income on the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities\nwould be accounted for as original issue\ndiscount on an economic accrual basis\nregardless of your method of tax accounting,\nand actual distributions of stated interest\nwould not be reported as taxable income.\nConsequently, you would be required to include\noriginal issue discount in gross income even\nthough we would not make any actual cash\npayments during an extension period. These\nregulations have not been addressed in any\nrulings or other interpretations by the\nInternal Revenue Service, and it is possible\nthat the Internal Revenue Service could take a\nposition contrary to the interpretation in\nthis prospectus. Because income on the capital\nsecurities will constitute interest or\noriginal issue discount, corporate U.S.\nholders of the capital securities will not be\nentitled to a dividends-received deduction for\nany income taken into account on the capital\nsecurities. Moreover, because income on the\ncapital securities will constitute interest or\noriginal issue discount, U.S. holders of the\ncapital securities will not be entitled to the\npreferential tax rate generally applicable to\npayments of dividends. In the rest of this\ndiscussion, we assume that unless and until we\nexercise our option to defer any payment of\ninterest, the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities will not be treated as issued with\noriginal issue discount, and whenever we use\nthe term interest, it also includes income in\nthe form of original issue discount. 48\n\nDistribution of Corresponding Subordinated\nDebt Securities to Holders of Capital\nSecurities Upon Liquidation of the Issuer\nTrusts\n\nIf the applicable Issuer Trust distributes the\nsubordinated debentures as described above\nunder the caption\n\u0093Description of Capital Securities and Related\nInstruments \u0097 Liquidation Distribution Upon\nDissolution\u0094, you will receive directly your\nproportional share of the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities previously held\nindirectly\nthrough the trust. Under current law, you will\nnot be taxed on the distribution and your\nholding period and aggregate tax basis in your\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities\nwill be equal to the holding period and\naggregate tax basis you had in\nyour capital securities before the\ndistribution. If, however, the trust were to\nbecome taxed on the income received or accrued\non the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities due to a tax event, the trust might\nbe taxed on a distribution of\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities to\nyou, and you might recognize gain or loss as\nif you had exchanged your capital securities\nfor the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities you received upon the liquidation\nof the trust. You will\ninclude interest in income in respect of\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities\nreceived from the trust in the manner\ndescribed above under \u0093\u0097 Taxation of Capital\nSecurities \u0097 Interest Income and Original\nIssue Discount\u0094.\n\nSale or Redemption of Capital Securities\n\nIf you\nsell your capital securities, including\nthrough a redemption for cash, you will\nrecognize gain or loss equal to the difference\nbetween your adjusted tax basis in your\ncapital securities and the amount you realize\non the sale of your capital\nsecurities (except to the extent any amount\nthat you realize is treated as a payment of\naccrued interest on your proportional share of\nthe corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities). Assuming that we do not exercise\nour option to defer payment of\ninterest on the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities, your adjusted tax basis in\nyour capital securities generally will be the\nprice you paid for your capital securities.\n\nIf the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities are deemed to be issued with\noriginal issue discount as a result of an\nactual deferral of interest\npayments, your adjusted tax basis in your\ncapital securities generally will be the price\nyou paid for your capital securities,\nincreased by original issue discount\npreviously includible in your gross income to\nthe date of disposition and decreased\nby distributions or other payments you\nreceived on your capital securities (other\nthan qualified stated interest on the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities)\nsince and including the date of the first\nextension period. This gain or loss\ngenerally will be capital gain or loss.\nCapital gain of a non-corporate United States\nholder is generally taxed at preferential\nrates where the property is held for more than\none year.\n\nIf we exercise our option to defer any payment\nof interest on the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities, our capital securities may\ntrade at a\nprice that does not accurately reflect the\nvalue of accrued but unpaid interest with\nrespect to the underlying corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities. If you sell your\ncapital securities before the record date for\nthe payment of distributions,\nyou will not receive payment of a distribution\nfor the period before the sale. However, you\nwill be required to include accrued but unpaid\ninterest on the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities through the date of the sale\nas ordinary income for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes and to add\nthe amount of accrued but unpaid interest to\nyour tax basis in the capital securities.

U.S. Federal Income Tax\nIf you are engaged in a trade or business in\nthe U.S. (and, if a tax treaty applies,\nmaintain a permanent establishment within the\nU.S.) and receive a distribution on a capital\nsecurity that is effectively connected with\nthe conduct of such trade or business (and, if\na tax treaty applies, attributable to such\npermanent establishment) you will be subject\nto U.S. federal income tax on such\ndistribution on a net income basis in\ngenerally the same manner as a United States\nholder. In addition, in certain circumstances,\nif you are a foreign corporation, you may be\nsubject to a 30% (or, if a tax treaty applies,\nsuch lower rate as provided) branch profits\ntax. 51\n\nYou will not be subject to U.S. federal income\ntax on any gain realized on the sale or\nexchange of the capital security, unless:\n                                              \n      such gain is effectively connected      \n      with the conduct of your trade or       \n      business in the United States (and,     \n      where an                                \n      applicable tax treaty so provides, is   \n      also attributable to a U.S. permanent   \n      establishment maintained by you); or    \n                                              \n                                              \n      you are an individual who is present    \n      in the United States for 183 days or    \n      more in the taxable year of the         \n      disposition and                         \n      certain other conditions are met.       \n                                              \nForeign Account Tax\nCompliance A U.S. law\nenacted in 2010\n(commonly known as\n\u0093FATCA\u0094) could impose\na withholding tax of\n30% on interest income\n(including original\nissue discount) and\nother periodic\npayments on capital\nsecurities paid to you\nor any non-U.S.person\nor entity that\nreceives such income\n(a \u0093non-U.S.payee\u0094) on\nyour behalf, unless\nyou and each such\nnon-U.S.payee in the\npayment chain comply\nwith the applicable\ninformation reporting,\naccount\nidentification,\nwithholding,\ncertification and\nother FATCA-related\nrequirements. In the\ncase of a payee that\nis a non-U.S.financial\ninstitution (for\nexample, a clearing\nsystem, custodian,\nnominee or broker),\nwithholding generally\nwill not be imposed if\nthe financial\ninstitution complies\nwith the requirements\nimposed by FATCA to\ncollect and report (to\nthe U.S. or another\nrelevant taxing\nauthority) substantial\ninformation regarding\nsuch institution\u0092s\nU.S. account holders\n(which would include\nsome account holders\nthat are\nnon-U.S.entities but\nhave U.S. owners).\nOther payees,\nincluding individuals,\nmay be required to\nprovide proof of tax\nresidence or waivers\nof confidentiality\nlaws and/or, in the\ncase of\nnon-U.S.entities,\ncertification or\ninformation relating\nto their U.S.\nownership. Withholding\nmay be imposed at any\npoint in a chain of\npayments if the payee\nis not compliant. A\nchain may work as\nfollows, for example:\nThe payment is\ntransferred through a\npaying agent to a\nclearing system, the\nclearing system makes\na payment to each of\nthe clearing system\u0092s\nparticipants, and\nfinally the clearing\nsystem participant\nmakes a payment to a\nnon-U.S.bank or broker\nthrough which you hold\nthe capital\nsecurities, who\ncredits the payment to\nyour account.\nAccordingly, if you\nreceive payments\nthrough a chain that\nincludes one or more\nnon-U.S.payees, such\nas a non-U.S.bank or\nbroker, the payment\ncould be subject to\nwithholding if, for\nexample, your\nnon-U.S.bank or broker\nthrough which you hold\nthe capital securities\nfails to comply with\nthe FATCA requirements\nand is subject to\nwithholding. This\nwould be the case even\nif you would not\notherwise have been\ndirectly subject to\nwithholding. Backup\nWithholding Tax and\nInformation Reporting\nUnited States Holders\nIn general, if you are\na noncorporate United\nStates holder, we and\nother payors are\nrequired to report to\nthe Internal Revenue\nService all\ndistributions on your\ncapital securities,\nand the accrual of\noriginal issue\ndiscount on an\noriginal issue\ndiscount capital\nsecurity. In addition,\nwe and other payors\nare required to report\nto the Internal\nRevenue Service any\npayment of proceeds of\nthe sale of your\ncapital securities\nbefore maturity within\nthe United States.\nAdditionally, backup\nwithholding will apply\nto any payments on\nyour capital\nsecurities, including\npayments of original\nissue discount, if you\nfail to provide an\naccurate taxpayer\nidentification number,\nor (in the case of\ndistributions\nattributable to\ninterest or original\nissue discount) you\nare notified by the\nInternal Revenue\nService that you have\nfailed to report all\ninterest and dividends\nrequired to be shown\non your federal income\ntax returns. You\ngenerally may obtain a\nrefund of any amounts\nwithheld under the\nUnited States backup\nwithholding rules that\nexceed your income tax\nliability by filing a\nrefund claim with the\nInternal Revenue\nService. 52\n\nNon-UnitedStates\nHolders\n\nIn general, if you are\na Non-United States\nholder, payments of\nprincipal or interest,\nincluding original\nissue\ndiscount, made by us\nand other payors to\nyou will not be\nsubject to information\nreporting and backup\nwithholding, provided\nthat the certification\nrequirements described\nabove under \u0093\u0097 Non-\nUnited\nStates Holders\u0094 are\nsatisfied or you\notherwise establish an\nexemption. However, we\nand other payors are\nrequired to report\npayments of interest\non your capital\nsecurities, including\noriginal issue\ndiscount, on Internal\nRevenue Service Form\n1042-S even if the\npayments are not\notherwise subject to\ninformation reporting\nrequirements. In\naddition, payment of\nthe proceeds from the\nsale of capital\nsecurities effected at\na United States office\nof a broker\nwill not be subject to\nbackup withholding and\ninformation reporting\nif you have furnished\nto the payor or broker\nan appropriate\nInternal Revenue\nService Form W-8, an\nacceptable substitute\nform or other\ndocumentation upon\nwhich it may rely to\ntreat the payment as\nmade to a non-United\nStates person.\n\nIn\ngeneral, payment of\nthe proceeds from the\ndisposition of capital\nsecurities effected at\na foreign office of a\nbroker will not be\nsubject to information\nreporting or backup\nwithholding. However,\na sale effected at a\nforeign office of a\nbroker could\nbe subject to\ninformation reporting\nin the same manner as\na sale within the\nUnited States (and in\ncertain cases may be\nsubject to backup\nwithholding as well)\nif (i) the broker has\ncertain connections to\nthe United States,\n(ii) the proceeds\nor confirmation are\nsent to the United\nStates or (iii) the\nsale has certain other\nspecified connections\nwith the United\nStates.\n\nYou generally\nmay obtain a refund of\nany amounts withheld\nunder the backup\nwithholding rules that\nexceed your U.S.\nfederal income tax\nliability, by filing a\nrefund claim with the\nInternal Revenue\nService.\n\n53\n\nVALIDITY OF THE\nSECURITIES\n\nThe validity of the\ncapital securities has\nbeen passed upon for\nThe Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. and the\nIssuer Trusts by\nRichards, Layton &\nFinger, P.A.,\nWilmington, Delaware.\nThe opinion of\nRichards, Layton &\nFinger, P.A. was based\non assumptions about\nfuture actions\nrequired to be taken\nby The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc., the\nIssuer Trusts and the\ntrustees in connection\nwith\nthe issuance and sale\nof the capital\nsecurities, about the\nspecific terms of the\ncapital securities and\nabout other matters\nthat may affect the\nvalidity of the\ncapital securities but\nwhich could not be\nascertained on the\ndate of that opinion.\n\nThe validity of the\nguarantees and the\ncorresponding\nsubordinated debt\nsecurities has been\npassed upon for The\nGoldman Sachs Group,\nInc. by\nSullivan & Cromwell\nLLP, New York, New\nYork.

Those organizations\ninclude Euroclear and Clearstream,\nLuxembourg.

You should\ncarefully review the following risk factors\nand the other information contained in this\nprospectus and in the documents incorporated\nby reference in this prospectus, including\nthe description of investment risks relating\nto an investment in the securities of The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. described under\n\u0093Risk Factors\u0094 in Part I, Item IA or our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-Kfor the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2020, before deciding\nwhether this investment is suitable for you.\n\nYou Are Making an Investment Decision With\nRegard to the Subordinated Debt Securities\n\nAs Well As the Capital Securities\n\nThe Issuer\nTrust relies on the payments it receives on\nthe corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities to fund all payments on its\ncapital securities. In addition, the Issuer\nTrust may distribute the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities in exchange for\nits capital securities upon its dissolution\nand liquidation. Accordingly, you should\ncarefully review the information in this\nprospectus regarding both of these\nsecurities.\n\nPayments on the Capital Securities Are\nDependent on Our Payments\n\non the Subordinated Debt Securities\n\nThe\nability of the Issuer Trust timely to pay\ndistributions on the capital securities and\nto pay the liquidation amount is dependent\nupon our making the related payments on the\nsubordinated debt securities when due.\n\nIf we default on our obligation to pay\nprincipal of or any premium or interest on\nthe corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities, the Issuer Trust will\nnot have sufficient funds to pay\ndistributions or the liquidation amount on\nthe related capital securities. As a result,\nyou will not be able to rely upon the\nguarantee for payment of these amounts. You\nor the property trustee of the Issuer Trust\nmay, however, sue us to enforce the rights of\nthe Issuer Trust under the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities.

This means that we cannot make any\npayments on the subordinated debt securities\nor under the guarantee if certain events of\ndefault have occurred under our senior\nindebtedness. In the event of our bankruptcy\nor liquidation, our assets must be used to\npay off our senior debt and any\nsecured debt in full before any payments may\nbe made on the subordinated debt securities\nor under the guarantee.\n\nNeither the subordinated debt\nindenture governing the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities nor the amended\nand restated trust agreement and the\nguarantee relating to the capital securities\nplaces any limitation on the nature or amount\nof additional indebtedness that we, or\nour subsidiaries, may incur in the future.\n\n9\n\nThe Subordinated Debt Securities and the\nGuarantee Will Be Effectively Subordinated\n\nto the Obligations of Our Subsidiaries\n\nWe are\na holding company that conducts substantially\nall of our operations through subsidiaries.\nAs a result, our ability to make payments on\nthe subordinated debt securities and the\nguarantees will depend primarily upon the\nreceipt of dividends and other\ndistributions from our subsidiaries. Many of\nour subsidiaries, including our broker-\ndealer, bank and insurance subsidiaries, are\nsubject to laws that restrict dividend\npayments or authorize regulatory bodies to\nblock or reduce the flow of funds from\nthose subsidiaries to us. Restrictions or\nregulatory action of that kind could impede\naccess to funds that we need to make payments\non our obligations, including debt\nobligations. Furthermore, we have guaranteed\nthe payment obligations of\nGS&Co., Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Goldman\nSachs Bank (Europe) PLC, our regulated Irish\nBank, subject to certain exceptions, and have\npledged significant assets to Goldman Sachs\nBank USA to support our obligations to it.\nThese guarantees may\nrequire us to provide substantial funds or\nassets to our subsidiaries or their creditors\nand counterparties at a time when we are in\nneed of liquidity to fund our own\nobligations. In addition, our right to\nparticipate in any distribution of assets\nfrom any subsidiary, upon the subsidiary\u0092s\nliquidation or otherwise, is subject to the\nprior claims of creditors of that subsidiary,\nexcept to the extent that we are recognized\nas a creditor of that subsidiary. As a\nresult, the subordinated\ndebt securities and the guarantees will be\neffectively subordinated to all existing and\nfuture liabilities of our subsidiaries. You\nshould look only to the assets of The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. as the source of payment\nfor the subordinated debt\nsecurities and the guarantees.\n\nHolders Should Not Expect Us to Redeem the\nCorresponding\n\nSubordinated Debt Securities on Any\nParticular Date\n\nBy their terms, the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities may be redeemed\nby us at our option, either in whole or in\npart, at any time or upon the\noccurrence of a tax event or investment\ncompany event as described below under\n\u0093Description of Capital Securities and\nRelated Instruments \u0097 Corresponding\nSubordinated Debt Securities \u0097 Redemption and\nExchange\u0094. Any decision we\nmay make at any time to propose a redemption\nof the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities will depend, among other things,\nupon our evaluation of the overall level and\nquality of our capital components, considered\nin light of our risk\nexposures, earnings and growth strategy, as\nwell as general market conditions at such\ntime. Our right to redeem the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities is subject to an\nimportant limitation as described below.\nAccordingly, investors should\nnot expect us to redeem the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities on any\nparticular date.\n\nWe may not redeem the corresponding\nsubordinated\ndebt securities without having received the\nprior approval of the Federal Reserve Board\nunder the current capital guidelines\napplicable to us. We cannot assure you that\nthe Federal Reserve Board will approve any\nredemption of the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities that we may\npropose. We understand that the factors the\nFederal Reserve Board will consider in\nevaluating a proposed redemption by a bank\nholding company include, among other things,\nthe capital plans and stress tests\nsubmitted by the bank holding company, the\nbank holding company\u0092s ability to meet and\nexceed minimum regulatory capital ratios\nunder stressed scenarios, its expected\nsources and uses of capital over the planning\nhorizon (generally a period of\ntwo years) under baseline and stressed\nscenarios, and any potential impact of\nchanges to its business plan and activities\non its capital adequacy and liquidity,\nalthough the Federal Reserve Board may change\nthese factors at any time.\n\nIf we are unable to redeem the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities, the Issuer\nTrust will be unable to redeem the capital\nsecurities.\nAccordingly, there could be circumstances\nwhere we would wish to redeem or repurchase\nsome or all of the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities or the Issuer Trust wishes us\nto do so in order for it to redeem the\ncapital securities, and\nsufficient cash is\n\n10\n\navailable for that purpose, but we are\nrestricted from doing so because we have not\nbeen able to obtain approval from the Federal\nReserve Board.\n\nThe Guarantee Only Guarantees Payments on the\nCapital Securities\n\nif the Issuer Trust Has Cash Available\n\nIf we\nfail to make payments on the subordinated\ndebt securities, the Issuer Trust will be\nunable to make the related distribution,\nredemption or liquidation payments on the\ncapital securities to you. In those\ncircumstances, you cannot rely on the\nguarantee for payments of those amounts.\nInstead, if we are in default under the\nsubordinated debt securities, you may rely on\nthe property trustee of the Issuer Trust to\nenforce the trust\u0092s rights under the\nsubordinated debt securities or you\nmay directly sue us or seek other remedies to\ncollect your pro rata share of the payments\nowed.\n\nYou Will Not Receive Timely Distributions If\nWe Elect to Defer Payments\n\nWe may defer the payment of interest on the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities at\nany time up to 10 consecutive\nsemi-annual periods, provided that (1) no\nsuch extension period may extend beyond the\nstated maturity date and (2) we are not in\ndefault under the subordinated debt indenture\nwith respect to the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities\n(unless our default has not ripened into a\nformal \u0093event of default\u0094). If there is a\ndeferral, the Issuer Trust also will defer\ndistributions on the related capital\nsecurities. Before any extension period ends,\nwe may elect to extend the\nperiod further.\n\nAt the end of any extension period and upon\nthe payment of all interest then accrued and\nunpaid, we may elect to begin a new\nextension period. There is no limitation on\nthe number of extension periods. Deferrals of\npayments during an extension period will not\nresult in a default or event of default. For\nfurther information on our option to defer\npayments, see\n\u0093Description of Capital Securities and\nRelated Instruments \u0097 Corresponding\nSubordinated Debt Securities \u0097 Option to\nDefer Interest Payments\u0094 above.\n\nIf We Elect to Defer Interest Payments, You\nWill Have to Include Interest in Your Taxable\nIncome Before You Receive the Money\n\nDuring an extension period, you would be\nrequired to accrue interest income for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes on your\nproportionate share of the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities\nheld by the Issuer Trust, even if you are a\ncash basis taxpayer. As a result, you would\nneed to include this income in your gross\nincome for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nin advance of the receipt of\ncash. You also would not receive the cash\nrelated to any accrued and unpaid interest\nincome from the trust if you dispose of the\ncapital securities prior to the record date\nfor the payment of distributions. For further\ninformation, see \u0093United\nStates Taxation \u0097 Interest Income and\nOriginal Issue Discount\u0094 and \u0093United States\nTaxation \u0097 Sale or Redemption of Capital\nSecurities\u0094 below.\n\nThe Market Price of the Capital Securities\nMay Not Reflect Unpaid Interest, and You May\nSuffer a Loss If You Sell Them While Interest\nRemains Unpaid\n\nBecause of our right to defer interest\npayments on the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities, the market price of the\nrelated capital\nsecurities may be more volatile than the\nmarket prices of similar securities that do\nnot have this feature. If we exercise our\nright to defer, the market price of the\ncapital securities may decline. Accordingly,\nthe capital securities that you\npurchase in the secondary market, or the\nsubordinated debt securities that you may\nreceive on liquidation of the trust, may\ntrade at a discount to the price that you\npaid.\n\nIf you dispose of your capital securities\nbefore the record date for the payment of a\ndistribution, then you will not receive that\ndistribution.\nHowever, you will be required to include\naccrued but unpaid\n\n11\n\ninterest on the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities through the date of the sale\nas ordinary income for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes and to add the amount of the\naccrued but unpaid interest to your tax basis\nin the capital securities. Your increased tax\nbasis in the capital securities will increase\nthe amount of any capital loss that you may\nhave otherwise realized on the sale. In\ngeneral, an individual taxpayer may offset\nonly $3,000 of capital losses against\nordinary income during any year. For further\ninformation on tax consequences, see \u0093United\nStates Taxation \u0097 Sale or Redemption of\nCapital Securities\u0094 below. We May Redeem the\nCorresponding Subordinated Debt Securities\nUpon the Occurrence of Specified Tax or\nRegulatory Events We may redeem the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities in\nwhole at any time within 90 days following\nthe occurrence of specified tax or regulatory\nevents, including:\n                                              \n      any change in tax laws or regulations   \n      (or any official interpretation) that   \n      poses a substantial risk that the       \n      related                                 \n      capital securities might lose their     \n      special tax treatment; and              \n                                              \n                                              \n      any change in laws or regulations (or   \n      any official interpretation) that       \n      poses a substantial risk that the       \n      Issuer Trust is                         \n      or will be considered an \u0093investment     \n      company\u0094 that is required to be          \n      registered under the Investment         \n      Company Act of 1940.                    \n                                              \nIf we redeem the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities, the Issuer Trust will be\nrequired to redeem the related capital\nsecurities. Also, the redemption price we will\npay upon a redemption on any particular date\nwill be lower if the redemption is due to a\ntax or regulatory event, as described above,\nthan if it is not. For further information on\nredemption, see \u0093Description of Capital\nSecurities and Related Instruments \u0097Redemption\nor Exchange\u0094 below. The Issuer Trust May\nDistribute the Subordinated Debt Securities In\nExchange For the Capital Securities, Which\nCould Affect the Market Price and Could Be a\nTaxable Event We may dissolve the Issuer Trust\nat any time. After satisfying its liabilities\nto its creditors, the Issuer Trust may\ndistribute the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities to the holders of the related\ncapital securities. For further information,\nsee \u0093Description of Capital Securities and\nRelated Instruments \u0097 Liquidation Distribution\nUpon Dissolution\u0094 above. We cannot predict the\nmarket prices for capital securities or for\nsubordinated debt securities that may be\ndistributed in exchange for capital\nsecurities. Accordingly, the capital\nsecurities, or the subordinated debt\nsecurities that you may receive on liquidation\nof the Issuer Trust, may trade at a discount\nto the price that you paid to purchase the\ncapital securities. Under current U.S. federal\nincome tax law and the amended and restated\ntrust agreement attached as an exhibit to our\nregistration statement filed with the SEC, the\nIssuer Trust is not classified as an\nassociation taxable as a corporation, you will\nnot be taxed if we dissolve the trust and the\ntrust distributes subordinated debt securities\nto you. However, if the Issuer Trust were to\nbecome taxed on the income received or accrued\non the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities due to a tax event, both you and\nthe Issuer Trust might be taxed on a\ndistribution of the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities by the trust. For further\ninformation, see \u0093United States Taxation \u0097\nDistribution of Subordinated Debt Securities\nto Holders of Capital Securities Upon\nLiquidation of the Issuer Trust\u0094 below. 12\n\nInvestors Do Not Control the Administration of\nthe Issuer Trust\n\nand Have Limited Voting Rights\n\nWe hold all the\ncommon securities of the Issuer Trust. These\nsecurities give us the right to control nearly\nall aspects of the administration, operation\nor management of the Issuer Trust, including\nselection and removal of the administrative\ntrustees. The capital\nsecurities, on the other hand, generally have\nno voting rights. You will be able to vote\nonly on matters relating to the modification\nof the terms of your capital securities or the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities,\nthe acceleration of\npayments on those securities and waivers of\nrelated past defaults as described in this\nprospectus. For further information, see\n\u0093Description of Capital Securities and Related\nInstruments \u0097 Voting Rights; Amendment of Each\nTrust\nAgreement\u0094 below.\n\n13\n\nTHE ISSUER TRUST Please note that in this\nsection entitled \u0093The Issuer Trust\u0094,\nreferences to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.,\n\u0093we\u0094, \u0093our\u0094 and \u0093us\u0094 refer only to The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. and not to its consolidated\nsubsidiaries.

In\naddition to capital securities issued to the\npublic, the Issuer Trust issued common\nsecurities representing common beneficial\ninterests in the Issuer Trust to The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc., and we call these\nsecurities \u0093trust common securities\u0094. All of\nthe trust common securities of the Issuer\nTrust are owned by us. The trust common\nsecurities and the capital securities are also\nreferred to together as the \u0093trust\nsecurities\u0094. The trust agreement provides that\nIssuer Trust exists for the exclusive purposes\nof:\n                                              \n      issuing and selling its trust           \n      securities;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      using the proceeds from the sale of     \n      these trust securities to acquire       \n      corresponding subordinated debt         \n      securities from us;                     \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      engaging in only those other            \n      activities necessary or incidental to   \n      these purposes (for example,            \n      registering the transfer of             \n      the trust securities).                  \n                                              \nWhen the Issuer Trust sold the trust\nsecurities in 2004, it used the proceeds it\nreceived to buy a series of our subordinated\ndebt securities, which are described further\nbelow. The payment terms of the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities were\nsubstantially the same as the terms of the\nIssuer Trust\u0092s capital securities. As\ndescribed above in the summary, approximately\nhalf of the capital securities and trust\ncommon securities as well as the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities were redeemed\nduring 2014 and the first quarter of 2015. The\nIssuer Trust owns only the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities. The only source\nof funds for the Issuer Trust is the payments\nit receives from us on the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities. The Issuer Trust\nuses these funds to make any cash payments due\nto holders of its capital securities. 14\n\nThe Issuer Trust is also a party to an expense\nagreement with The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nUnder the terms of the expense agreement, the\nIssuer Trust has the right to be reimbursed by\nus for certain expenses. The trust common\nsecurities of the Issuer Trust rank equally,\nand payments on them will be made pro rata,\nwith the capital securities of the Issuer\nTrust, except that upon the occurrence and\ncontinuance of an event of default under the\ntrust agreement resulting from an event of\ndefault under the subordinated debt indenture,\nour rights, as holder of the trust common\nsecurities, to payment in respect of\ndistributions and payments upon liquidation or\nredemption are subordinated to the rights of\nthe holders of the capital securities of the\nIssuer Trust. See \u0093Description of Capital\nSecurities and Related Instruments \u0097\nSubordination of Trust Common Securities\u0094. We\ncurrently hold trust common securities in an\naggregate liquidation amount of approximately\n$29 million. Under certain circumstances, we\nmay redeem the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities that we sold to the Issuer Trust.\nIf this happens, the Issuer Trust will redeem\na like amount of the capital securities that\nit sold to the public and the trust common\nsecurities that it sold to us.

Also, in this section,\nreferences to \u0093holders\u0094 mean those who own\ncapital securities registered in their own\nnames, on the books that the Issuer Trust or\nproperty trustee maintains for this purpose,\nand not those who own beneficial interests in\ncapital securities registered in street name\nor in capital securities issued in book-entry\nform through one or more depositaries. Owners\nof beneficial interest in the capital\nsecurities should read the section below\nentitled \u0093Legal Ownership and Book-Entry\nIssuance\u0094. General The trust agreement\nauthorizes the administrative trustees to\nissue the capital securities and the trust\ncommon securities. The trust agreement was\nqualified as an indenture under the Trust\nIndenture Act of 1939. The terms of the\ncapital securities include those in the trust\nagreement and those made part of the trust\nagreement by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.\nYou should read the following description\ntogether with the trust agreement to help you\nunderstand the terms of the capital\nsecurities. A form of the trust agreement has\nbeen filed as an exhibit to the registration\nstatement of which this prospectus forms a\npart. The Issuer Trust\u0092s only assets are the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities,\nwhich were issued under the subordinated debt\nindenture. The capital securities represent\nundivided preferred beneficial interests in\nthe Issuer Trust\u0092s assets. All of the trust\ncommon securities are owned, directly or\nindirectly, by us. The trust common securities\nrank equally, and payments will be made on the\ntrust common securities on a pro rata basis,\nwith the capital securities except as\ndescribed under \u0093\u0097 Subordination of Trust\nCommon Securities\u0094. The trust agreement does\nnot permit the Issuer Trust to issue the\ncapital securities and trust common securities\nor to incur any debt. The trustees for the\nIssuer Trust are The Bank of New York Mellon,\nas property trustee, and The Bank of New York\nMellon (Delaware), as Delaware trustee, and\nthree individual administrative trustees who\nare employees or officers of us or our\naffiliates. The guarantee agreement executed\nby us for the benefit of the holders of the\nIssuer Trust\u0092s capital securities is a\nguarantee on a subordinated basis with respect\nto the related capital securities but does not\nguarantee payment of distributions or amounts\npayable on redemption or liquidation of such\ncapital securities when the Issuer Trust does\nnot have funds on hand available to make such\npayments. See \u0093\u0097 Guarantee and Expense\nAgreement\u0094 below. Distributions Distributions\non the capital securities are cumulative and\naccrue from February 20, 2004 at the annual\nrate of 6.345% of the liquidation amount of\neach capital security. When we say that\ndistributions on the capital securities are\ncumulative, we mean that if distributions are\ndeferred or otherwise not paid, they will\naccumulate until paid out. Distributions will\nbe payable semi-annually in arrears on\nFebruary 15 and August 15 of each year to\nholders of the capital securities.\nDistributions not paid when due for more than\none semi-annual payment period will themselves\naccumulate interest (to the extent legally\npermitted) at the annual rate of 6.345%\ncompounded semi-annually. The Issuer Trust\ncomputes the amount of distributions payable\nfor any period on the basis of 30/360 (ISDA)\nas follows:\n                                           \n  [360 \u00d7 (Y2\u0096Y1)] + [30 \u00d7 (M2\u0096M1)] + (D2\u0096D1)  \n  360                                      \n                                           \n17\n\nwhere:\n                                              \n      \u0093Y1\u0094 is the year, expressed as a number,  \n      in which the first day of the period    \n      falls;                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      \u0093Y2\u0094 is the year, expressed as a number,  \n      in which the day immediately following  \n      the last day included in the            \n      period falls;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      \u0093M1\u0094 is the calendar month, expressed as  \n      a number, in which the first day of     \n      the period falls;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      \u0093M2\u0094 is the calendar month, expressed as  \n      a number, in which the day immediately  \n      following the last day included         \n      in the period falls;                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      \u0093D1\u0094 is the first calendar day,           \n      expressed as a number, of the period,   \n      unless such number would be 31, in      \n      which                                   \n      case D1 will be 30; and                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      \u0093D2\u0094 is the calendar day, expressed as a  \n      number, immediately following the last  \n      day included in the period,             \n      unless such number would be 31 and D1   \n      is greater than 29, in which case D2    \n      will be 30.                             \n                                              \nIn the event that any date on which\ndistributions on the capital securities are\npayable is not a business day, payment of that\ndistribution will be made on the next business\nday (and without any interest or other payment\nin connection with this delay) except that, if\nthe next business day falls in the next\ncalendar year, payment of the distribution\nwill be made on the immediately preceding\nbusiness day, in either case with the same\nforce and effect as if made on the original\ndistribution date. Each date on which\ndistributions are payable in accordance with\nthe previous sentence is referred to as a\n\u0093distribution date\u0094. The term \u0093business day\u0094\nmeans, for any capital security, any Monday,\nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday that is\nnot a day on which banking institutions in New\nYork City generally are authorized or\nobligated by law or executive order to close.\nThe term \u0093distributions\u0094 includes any semi-\nannual payments made on the capital securities\nand trust common securities, any deferred\ndistribution and any payments that accumulate\non distributions not paid on the applicable\ndistribution date, all as further described\nbelow. If an extension period occurs with\nrespect to the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities, distributions on the related\ncapital securities will be correspondingly\ndeferred (but would continue to accumulate\nadditional distributions at the annual rate of\n6.345%). See \u0093\u0097 Corresponding Subordinated\nDebt Securities \u0097Option to Defer Interest\nPayments\u0094 below. The revenue of the Issuer\nTrust available for distribution to holders of\nits capital securities is limited to payments\nunder the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities. See \u0093\u0097 Corresponding Subordinated\nDebt Securities\u0094. If we do not make interest\npayments on the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities, the property trustee will not\nhave funds available to pay distributions on\nthe capital securities. The payment of\ndistributions (if and to the extent the Issuer\nTrust has funds legally available for the\npayment of distributions and cash sufficient\nto make payments) is guaranteed by us as\ndescribed below under the heading \u0093\u0097 Guarantee\nand Expense Agreement\u0094. Distributions on the\ncapital securities will be payable to the\nholders of capital securities as they appear\non the register of the Issuer Trust at the\nclose of business on the relevant record\ndates, which, as long as the capital\nsecurities remain in book-entry form, will be\none business day prior to the relevant\ndistribution date. Subject to any applicable\nlaws and regulations and the provisions of the\ntrust agreement, each such payment will be\nmade as described under the heading \u0093Legal\nOwnership and Book-Entry Issuance\u0094. In the\nevent any capital securities are not in book-\nentry form, the relevant record date for such\ncapital securities will be the date 15 days\nprior to the relevant distribution date\n(whether or not a business day). 18\n\nRedemption or Exchange Mandatory Redemption\nThe capital securities have no stated maturity\nbut must be redeemed upon the maturity of the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities or\ntheir earlier redemption. The corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities will mature on\nFebruary 15, 2034. Any redemption of capital\nsecurities must occur as described in this\nsection. If we repay or redeem the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities at\nany time, the Issuer Trust will be obligated\nto redeem a like amount of capital securities\nand trust common securities. The redemption of\nthe capital securities will occur on the\nredemption date, which means the date on which\npayment of the principal of those subordinated\ndebt securities becomes due under the\nsubordinated debt indenture. The redemption\nprice for the capital securities will be the\ntotal liquidation amount of the capital\nsecurities being redeemed, plus\n                                              \n      accumulated but unpaid distributions    \n      up to and including the redemption      \n      date; and                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      the related amount of the make-whole    \n      amount, if any, in excess of the total  \n      liquidation amount of the capital       \n      securities                              \n      being redeemed, paid by us on the       \n      concurrent redemption of the            \n      corresponding subordinated debt         \n      securities.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      We may redeem the corresponding         \n      subordinated debt securities before     \n      their stated maturity as follows:       \n                                              \n                                              \n      in whole at any time or in part from    \n      time to time, provided that no partial  \n      redemption may occur during an          \n      extension                               \n      period; or                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      in whole at any time within 90 days     \n      after the occurrence of a tax event or  \n      investment company event.               \n                                              \nIf we elect to redeem the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities, we will do so at\nthe relevant redemption price. The redemption\nprice for the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities will equal the greater of:\n                                              \n      100% of the principal amount of the     \n      corresponding subordinated debt         \n      securities being redeemed, and          \n                                              \n                                              \n      the make-whole amount, if any, as       \n      determined by the quotation agent,      \n      equal to the sum of the present values  \n      of scheduled                            \n      payments of principal and interest      \n      from the redemption date to February\u00a0   \n      15, 2034 on the corresponding           \n      subordinated debt securities being      \n      redeemed, discounted to the redemption  \n      date on a semi-annual basis at a        \n      discount rate equal to the treasury     \n      rate (as described below) plus a        \n      spread of 0.50%, in the case of a       \n      redemption after the occurrence of a    \n      tax event or investment company event,  \n      or plus a spread of 0.20%, in the case  \n      of any other redemption,                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nplus, in either case, accrued and unpaid\ninterest on the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities being redeemed. Because the\nspread percentage will be higher for a\nredemption after a tax event or investment\ncompany event than for a redemption in other\ncircumstances, the make-whole amount (and thus\nthe redemption price) we will pay to redeem\nyour capital securities will be lower if the\nredemption is due to an event of this kind\nthan if it is not. The \u0093quotation agent\u0094 will\ninitially be GS&Co. However, if GS&Co. ceases\nto be a primary U.S. Government securities\ndealer in New York City, we will replace them\nwith another primary U.S. Government\nsecurities dealer. 19\n\nIf less than all of the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities are redeemed or\nrepaid, then the aggregate liquidation amount\nof the trust securities to be redeemed will be\nallocated approximately 3% to the trust common\nsecurities and 97% to the capital securities,\nexcept in the case of an event of default as a\nresult of any failure by us to make any\npayments on the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities when due after any applicable\ngrace period (in which case 100% will be\nallocated to the capital securities). See\n\u0093Description of Capital Securities and Related\nInstruments \u0097 Subordination of Trust Common\nSecurities\u0094 below. The Issuer Trust cannot\nredeem less than all of the capital securities\nunless all accrued and unpaid distributions on\nthe capital securities and trust common\nsecurities have been paid on or before the\nredemption date.

The treasury rate      \n      will be calculated on the third         \n      business day preceding the redemption   \n      date.                                   \n                                              \nThe \u0093comparable treasury issue\u0094, with respect\nto any redemption date, will be the U.S.\nTreasury security selected by the quotation\nagent as having a maturity comparable to the\ntime period from the redemption date to\nFebruary 15, 2034 that would be utilized, at\nthe time of selection and in accordance with\ncustomary financial practice, in pricing new\nissues of corporate debt securities of\ncomparable maturity to this time period. If no\nU.S. Treasury security has a maturity which is\nwithin a period from three months before to\nthree months after February 15, 2034, the two\nmost closely corresponding U.S. Treasury\nsecurities will be used as the comparable\ntreasury issue, and the treasury rate will be\ninterpolated or extrapolated on a straight-\nline basis, rounding to the nearest month\nusing such securities. The \u0093comparable\ntreasury price\u0094, with respect to any\nredemption date, will be (1) the average of\nfive reference treasury dealer quotations (as\ndescribed below) for such redemption date,\nafter excluding the highest and lowest of such\nreference treasury dealer quotations, or (2)\nif the subordinated debt trustee obtains fewer\nthan five such reference treasury dealer\nquotations, the average of all such\nquotations. The \u0093reference treasury dealer\nquotations\u0094 means, with respect to each\nreference treasury dealer (as described below)\nand any redemption date, the average, as\ndetermined by the subordinated debt trustee,\nof the bid and ask prices for the comparable\ntreasury issue, expressed in each case as a\npercentage of its principal amount, quoted in\nwriting to the subordinated debt trustee by\nsuch reference treasury dealer at 5:00 p.m.,\nNew York City time, on the third business day\npreceding such redemption date. The \u0093reference\ntreasury dealer\u0094 will be (1) the quotation\nagent or (2) any other primary U.S. Government\nsecurities dealer selected by the quotation\nagent after consultation with us. \u0093Like\namount\u0094 means, with respect to a redemption of\nany trust securities, trust securities having\na liquidation amount equal to the principal\namount of subordinated debt securities to be\ncontemporaneously redeemed in accordance with\nthe subordinated debt indenture, the proceeds\nof which will be used to pay the redemption\nprice of the trust securities. \u0093Liquidation\namount\u0094 means the stated amount per trust\nsecurity of $1,000. 21\n\nRedemption Procedures Holders will receive at\nleast 30 days\u0092, but not more than 60 days\u0092,\nwritten notice before any redemption of\ncapital securities. If there are accumulated\nand unpaid distributions on the capital\nsecurities that have not been paid on or\nbefore the redemption date, the Issuer Trust\ncannot redeem less than all of the capital\nsecurities. If (1) the Issuer Trust gives\nirrevocable notice of redemption of the\ncapital securities, and (2) we have paid to\nthe property trustee a sufficient amount of\ncash in connection with the related redemption\nor maturity of the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities, then on the redemption date,\nthe property trustee will irrevocably deposit\nwith DTC funds sufficient to pay the\nredemption price for the capital securities\nbeing redeemed. The Issuer Trust will also\ngive DTC irrevocable instructions and\nauthority to pay the redemption amount in\nimmediately available funds to the beneficial\nowners of the global securities representing\nthe capital securities. Distributions to be\npaid on or before the redemption date for any\ncapital securities called for redemption will\nbe payable to the holders on the record dates\nfor the related dates of distribution. Once\nnotice of redemption is given and funds are\nirrevocably deposited, distributions on the\ncapital securities will cease to accumulate\nimmediately prior to the close of business on\nthe redemption date and all rights of the\nholders of the capital securities called for\nredemption will cease, except for the right to\nreceive the redemption amount (but without\ninterest on such redemption amount). If any\nredemption date is not a business day, then\nthe redemption amount will be payable on the\nnext business day (and without any interest,\nadditional distributions or other payment in\nrespect of any such delay). However, if\npayment on the next business day causes\npayment of the redemption amount to be in the\nnext calendar year, then payment will be on\nthe preceding business day. If payment of the\nredemption amount for any capital securities\ncalled for redemption is improperly withheld\nor refused and not paid either by the Issuer\nTrust or by us under the guarantee,\ndistributions on the capital securities will\ncontinue to accumulate at the applicable rate\nfrom the original redemption date scheduled to\nthe actual date of payment. In this case, the\nactual payment date will be considered the\nredemption date for purposes of calculating\nthe amount to be redeemed and the redemption\nprice. If less than all of the capital\nsecurities are redeemed, the capital\nsecurities will be redeemed pro rata in\naccordance with DTC\u0092s applicable policies. We\nor our affiliates may at any time and from\ntime to time purchase outstanding capital\nsecurities by tender, in the open market or by\nprivate agreement. Distribution of\nCorresponding Subordinated Debt Securities We\nwill have the right at any time to cause the\ndissolution of the Issuer Trust and cause the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities to\nbe distributed pro rata to the holders of the\ncapital securities and trust common\nsecurities. If the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities are distributed to the holders\nof the capital securities, we will use our\nbest efforts to cause the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities to be listed on\nany exchange on which the capital securities\nare then listed.

Upon the occurrence of a\ndissolution event, the holders of capital\nsecurities will be entitled to receive out of\nthe Issuer Trust\u0092s assets, after satisfaction\nof liabilities to creditors, if any,\ndistributions in an amount equal to the\naggregate of the liquidation amount of $1,000\nper capital security plus accumulated and\nunpaid distributions thereon to the payment\ndate. However, such holders will not receive\nthis distribution if the Issuer Trust instead\ndistributes on a ratable basis to the holders\nof the capital securities subordinated debt\nsecurities in an aggregate principal amount\nequal to the aggregate liquidation amount of,\nwith an interest rate equal to the\ndistribution rate of, and bearing accrued and\nunpaid interest in an amount equal to accrued\nand unpaid distributions on, such capital\nsecurities. If this distribution can be paid\nonly in part because the Issuer Trust has\ninsufficient assets available to pay in full\nthe aggregate distribution, then the amounts\npayable directly by the Issuer Trust on the\ncapital securities will be paid on a ratable\nbasis. The holder of the trust common\nsecurities will be entitled to receive\ndistributions upon any such dissolution event\non a ratable basis with the holders of the\ncapital securities, except that if a trust\nevent of default resulting from a debenture\nevent of default has occurred and is\ncontinuing, the capital securities will have a\npreference over the trust common securities\nwith regard to such distributions.

Those events must arise     \n      under U.S. federal or state             \n                                              \n24\n                                              \n  law, unless we merge, consolidate or sell   \n  our assets as described above and the       \n  successor firm is a non-U.S. entity. If     \n  that happens, then those events             \n  must arise under U.S. federal or state law  \n  or the law of the jurisdiction in which     \n  the successor firm is legally organized.    \n                                              \nWithin five business days after the occurrence\nof any event of default with respect to the\ncapital securities actually known to the\nproperty trustee, the property trustee will\ntransmit notice of the event of default to the\nholders of such capital securities, the\nadministrative trustees and us, as depositor,\nunless the event of default has been cured or\nwaived. We, as depositor, and the\nadministrative trustees are required to file\nannually with the property trustee a\ncertificate as to whether or not they are in\ncompliance with all the conditions and\ncovenants applicable to them under the trust\nagreement. If an event of default under the\nsubordinated debt indenture has occurred and\nis continuing with respect to a series of\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities,\nthe series of related capital securities will\nhave a preference over the related trust\ncommon securities of the Issuer Trust as\ndescribed above. See \u0093\u0097 Liquidation\nDistribution Upon Dissolution\u0094 above. The\nexistence of an event of default does not\nentitle the holders of capital securities to\naccelerate the maturity of the capital\nsecurities. Whenever we refer to an event of\ndefault under the subordinated debt indenture\nin connection with the capital securities, we\nmean such an event of default with respect to\nthe corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities. Removal of Issuer Trust Trustees\nUnless an event of default under the\nsubordinated debt indenture has occurred and\nis continuing, the Issuer Trust trustee may be\nremoved at any time by the holder of the\nIssuer Trust\u0092s trust common securities. If an\nevent of default under the subordinated debt\nindenture has occurred and is continuing with\nrespect to a series of capital securities, the\nproperty trustee and the Delaware trustee may\nbe removed under the trust agreement by the\nholders of a majority in liquidation amount of\nthe outstanding capital securities of such\nseries. In no event will the holders of the\ncapital securities have the right to vote to\nappoint, remove or replace the administrative\ntrustees. Such voting rights are vested\nexclusively in us as the holder of the trust\ncommon securities. No resignation or removal\nof the Issuer Trust trustee and no appointment\nof a successor trustee will be effective until\nthe acceptance of appointment by the successor\ntrustee in accordance with the provisions of\nthe trust agreement. Co-Trusteesand Separate\nProperty Trustee Unless an event of default\nunder the subordinated debt indenture has\noccurred and is continuing, at any time or\nfrom time to time, for the purpose of meeting\nthe legal requirements of the Trust Indenture\nAct of 1939 or of any jurisdiction in which\nany part of the trust property may at the time\nbe located, we, as the holder of the trust\ncommon securities, and the administrative\ntrustees will have power to appoint one or\nmore persons either to act as a co-\ntrustee,jointly with the property trustee, of\nall or any part of the trust property, or to\nact as separate trustee of any trust property,\nin either case with the powers specified in\nthe instrument of appointment, and to vest in\nthe person or persons in this capacity any\nproperty, title, right or power deemed\nnecessary or desirable, subject to the\nprovisions of the trust agreement. In case an\nevent of default under the subordinated debt\nindenture has occurred and is continuing, the\nproperty trustee alone will have power to make\nthis appointment. Merger or Consolidation of\nIssuer Trust Trustees Any person into which\nthe property trustee, the Delaware trustee or\nany administrative trustee that is not a\nnatural person may be merged or converted or\nwith which it may be consolidated, or any 25\n\nperson resulting from any merger, conversion\nor consolidation to which the trustee will be\na party, or any person succeeding to all or\nsubstantially all the corporate trust business\nof the trustee, will automatically become the\nsuccessor of the trustee under each trust\nagreement, provided the person is otherwise\nqualified and eligible. Mergers,\nConsolidations, Amalgamations or Replacements\nof the Issuer Trust The Issuer Trust may not\nmerge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into\nor be replaced by or convey, transfer or lease\nits properties and assets substantially as an\nentirety to any corporation or other person,\nexcept as described below or as described\nabove under \u0093\u0097 Liquidation Distribution Upon\nDissolution\u0094.

The depositary\narrangements that will apply, including the\nmanner in which principal of and premium, if\nany, and interest on capital\nsecurities and other payments will be payable\nare discussed in more detail below under the\nheading \u0093Legal Ownership and Book-Entry\nIssuance\u0094.\n\nPayment and Paying Agency\n\nPayments in respect\nof capital securities will be made in\naccordance with the applicable policies of DTC\nas described under \u0093Legal Ownership and Book-\nEntry Issuance\u0094. If any capital securities are\nnot represented by global certificates,\npayments will be made\nby check mailed to the holder entitled to them\nat his or her address shown on the property\ntrustee\u0092s records as of the close of business\non the regular record date. The paying agent\nwill initially be the property trustee and any\nco-paying agent chosen by the property trustee\nand reasonably acceptable to the\nadministrative trustees and us. The paying\nagent will be permitted to resign as paying\nagent upon 30 days\u0092 written notice to the\nproperty trustee and us.

Subject to this provision,\nthe property trustee is under\nno obligation to exercise any of the powers\nvested in it by the trust agreement at the\nrequest of any holder of capital securities\nunless it is offered reasonable indemnity\nagainst the costs, expenses and liabilities\nthat might be incurred as a\nresult. If no event of default has occurred\nand is continuing and the property trustee is\nrequired to decide between alternative causes\nof action, construe ambiguous provisions in\nthe trust agreement or is unsure of the\napplication of any provision\nof the trust agreement, and the matter is not\none on which holders of capital securities are\nentitled under the trust agreement to vote,\n\n29\n\nthen the property trustee will take such\naction as is directed by us and if not so\ndirected, will take such action as it deems\nadvisable and in the best interests of the\nholders of the capital securities and will\nhave no liability except for its own bad\nfaith, negligence or willful misconduct.\nMiscellaneous The administrative trustees are\nauthorized and directed to conduct the affairs\nof and to operate the Issuer Trust in such a\nway that the Issuer Trust will not be (1)\ndeemed to be an \u0093investment company\u0094 required\nto be registered under the Investment Company\nAct of 1940 or (2) classified as an\nassociation taxable as a corporation or as\nother than a grantor trust for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes and so that the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities\nwill be treated as indebtedness of The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. In addition, we and the\nadministrative trustees are authorized to take\nany action not inconsistent with applicable\nlaw, the certificate of trust of the Issuer\nTrust or the trust agreement, that we and the\nadministrative trustees determine in their\ndiscretion to be necessary or desirable for\nsuch purposes as long as such action does not\nmaterially adversely affect the interests of\nthe holders of the capital securities.

The\njunior subordinated debentures are a separate\nseries of our subordinated debt securities and\nconstitute the \u0093corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities\u0094 with respect to the capital\nsecurities of the Issuer Trust.

Unless and until the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities are distributed\nto the holders of the related capital\nsecurities in exchange for the latter, the\nIssuer Trust (or property trustee) will be the\nsole holder of those debt securities for all\npurposes of the subordinated debt indenture,\nand the holders of the related capital\nsecurities will not have any ownership right,\ndirect or indirect, with respect to those debt\nsecurities. Upon a distribution of this kind,\nthe sole holder of those corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities will be the\nrelevant depositary, if the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities are distributed\nin book-entry form, or the former holders of\nthe capital securities who receive them in the\ndistribution, if the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities are not\ndistributed in book-entry form. See also\n\u0093Legal Ownership and Book-Entry Issuance\u0094\nbelow. Option to Defer Interest Payments If we\nare not in default under the subordinated debt\nindenture, we may, on one or more occasions,\ndefer the payment of interest on the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities for\nup to 10 consecutive semi-annual periods,\nwhich we refer to in each case as an\n\u0093extension period\u0094. Because interest payments\non the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities fund distributions on the capital\nsecurities, semi-annual distributions on the\ncapital securities will be deferred during any\nextension period. During an extension period,\nthe amount of distributions due to you on the\ncapital securities will accumulate and these\ndeferred distributions will accrue additional\ndistributions (to the extent legally\npermitted) at the annual rate of 6.345%\ncompounded semi-annually from the relevant\npayment date for the distributions. We may not\ndefer interest payments for any period of\ntime:\n                                              \n      that exceeds 10 consecutive             \n      semi-annual periods with respect to     \n      each extension period;

Deferral of interest payments\nduring an extension period is not an event of\ndefault under the subordinated debt indenture\nor the trust agreement.

Also, these conditions will apply only\nif we wish to merge or consolidate with\nanother entity or sell our assets\nsubstantially as an entirety to another\nentity. We will not need to satisfy these\nconditions if we enter into other types of\ntransactions, including any transaction in\nwhich we acquire the stock or assets of\nanother entity, any transaction that involves\na change of control of The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. but in which we do not merge or\nconsolidate and any transaction in which we\nsell less than substantially all our assets.\nAlso, if we merge, consolidate or sell our\nassets substantially as an entirety and the\nsuccessor is a non-U.S.entity, neither we nor\nany successor would have any obligation to\ncompensate the holder of the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities for any resulting\nadverse tax consequences relating to the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities.\nSubordination The corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities are subject to the provisions\nin the subordinated debt indenture that may\nprohibit us from making payments on the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities.\nSubordinated debt securities are subordinate\nand junior in right of payment, to the extent\nand in the manner stated in the subordinated\ndebt indenture, to all of our senior\nindebtedness, as defined in the subordinated\ndebt indenture, including all debt securities\nwe have issued and will issue under either of\nthe senior debt indentures and all warrants we\nwill issue under the warrant indenture. The\nsubordinated debt indenture defines \u0093senior\nindebtedness\u0094 as all indebtedness and\nobligations of, or guaranteed or assumed by,\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. for borrowed\nmoney or evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes\nor other similar instruments, whether existing\nnow or in the future, and all amendments,\nrenewals, extensions, modifications and\nrefundings of any indebtedness or obligations\nof that kind. Senior debt excludes the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities and\nany other indebtedness or obligations\nspecifically designated as being subordinate,\nor not superior, in right of payment to the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities. As\nused in this section, the term \u0093senior\nindebtedness\u0094 means (1) senior debt (as\ndescribed below), but excluding trade accounts\npayable and accrued liabilities arising in the\nordinary course of business, and (2) the\nallocable amounts of senior subordinated debt\n(as described below). For this purpose,\naccrued liabilities arising in the ordinary\ncourse of business do not include indebtedness\nfor money borrowed. \u0093Senior debt\u0094 means any\nobligation of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. to\nits creditors, whether now outstanding or\nsubsequently incurred, other than any\nobligation as to which, in the instrument\ncreating or evidencing the obligation or\npursuant to which the obligation is\noutstanding, it is provided that the\nobligation is not senior debt; provided that\nsenior debt does not include senior\nsubordinated debt or junior subordinated debt.\n\u0093Senior subordinated debt\u0094 means any\nobligation of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. to\nits creditors, whether now outstanding or\nsubsequently incurred, as to which, in the\ninstrument creating or evidencing the\nobligation or pursuant to which the obligation\nis outstanding, it is provided that the\nobligation is subordinate and junior in right\nof payment to senior debt pursuant to\nsubordination 33\n\nprovisions (including the definition of senior\ndebt) that are not substantially similar to\nthose applicable to the junior subordinated\ndebentures (provided that the obligation is\nnot subordinate\nand junior in right of payment to junior\nsubordinated debt).\n\n\u0093Junior subordinated debt\u0094 means any\nobligation of The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. to its creditors, whether now outstanding\nor subsequently incurred, as to which, in the\ninstrument creating or evidencing the\nobligation or pursuant to which the obligation\nis outstanding, it is provided that the\nobligation is subordinated and\njunior in right of payment to senior\nindebtedness pursuant to subordination\nprovisions (including the definition of senior\nindebtedness) substantially similar to those\napplicable to the junior subordinated\ndebentures. \u0093Junior subordinated\ndebt\u0094 includes the junior subordinated\ndebentures.\n\n\u0093Allocable amounts\u0094, when used with respect to\nany senior subordinated debt,\nmeans the amount necessary to pay all\nprincipal of and premium and interest, if any,\non such senior subordinated debt in full less,\nif applicable, any portion of such amount\nwhich would have been paid to, and retained\nby, the holders of such senior\nsubordinated debt (whether as a result of the\nreceipt of payments by the holders of such\nsenior subordinated debt from The Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc., the trustee in respect\nthereof or any other obligor thereon or from\nany holders of, or trustee in\nrespect of, other indebtedness that is\nsubordinate and junior in right of payment to\nsuch senior subordinated debt pursuant to any\nprovision of such indebtedness for the payment\nover of amounts received on account of such\nindebtedness to the holders\nof such senior subordinated debt) but for the\nfact that such senior subordinated debt is\nsubordinate or junior in right of payment to\ntrade accounts payable or accrued liabilities\narising in the ordinary course of business.\n\nThe definition of senior indebtedness that\napplies with respect to the junior\nsubordinated debentures may be different from\nthe definition that applies\nto other subordinated debt securities issued\nunder the subordinated debt indenture or with\nrespect to any other subordinated indebtedness\nthat we have incurred or may incur in the\nfuture.\n\nBecause of the definition of senior\nindebtedness, the junior subordinated\ndebentures will be subordinated in right of\npayment to virtually all our\nobligations to our creditors, including most\nof those that may be subordinated to other\nobligations, except for trade accounts payable\nand accrued liabilities arising in the\nordinary course of business, the junior\nsubordinated debentures and any\ncomparable series of debentures that we may\noffer in the future.\n\nOption to Extend Interest Payment Date\n\nIf no debenture event of default has occurred\nor is continuing with respect to the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities, we\nmay, on one or more\noccasions, defer interest payments on\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities for\nup to 10 consecutive semi-annual periods,\nreferred to as an \u0093extension period\u0094. An\nextension period may not extend beyond the\nmaturity of corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities on February 15,\n2034, and may not end on a date other than an\ninterest payment date. No interest will be due\nand payable on the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities until the end of the extension\nperiod unless\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities are\nredeemed prior to such time. This applies to\nany interest that may become due and payable,\nbut as to which the 30-day grace period has\nnot ended, before the\nextension period begins. Deferral of interest\nduring an extension period will not result in\nany default or event of default in respect of\nthe corresponding subordinated debt securities\nor the capital securities.\n\nIf the property trustee is the only registered\nholder of the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities, we will give the administrative\ntrustees, the\nproperty trustee and the subordinated debt\ntrustee notice if we decide to defer interest\npayments on the corresponding subordinated\ndebt\n\n34\n\nsecurities as specified in the terms of the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities.\nThe administrative trustees will then notify\nthe holders of the capital securities of our\ndecision to defer interest payments on the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities. If\nthe property trustee is not the only\nregistered holder of the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities, we will notify\nholders of corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities and the subordinated debt trustee\nof our election to defer interest payments on\nthe corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities. There is no limitation on the\nnumber of times that we may elect to begin an\nextension period, so long as we are not in\ndefault under the subordinated debt indenture.\nFor more information on our option to extend\nany interest payment period on the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities and\nthe relation of such extension to payment of\ndistributions on the capital securities, see\n\u0093Description of the Capital Securities and\nRelated Instruments \u0097 Distributions\u0094 above.\nRedemption We may redeem the junior\nsubordinated debentures before their maturity:\n                                              \n      in whole at any time, or in part from   \n      time to time, provided that no partial  \n      redemption may occur during an          \n      extension                               \n      period, or                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      in whole, but not in part, within 90    \n      days after the occurrence of a tax      \n      event or investment company event,      \n                                              \nin each case at a redemption price as\ndescribed above under \u0093Description of the\nCapital Securities \u0097Redemption or Exchange\u0094.\nIn the event of a tax event, we will pay any\nand all taxes, duties, assessments or\ngovernmental charges that may be owed by the\nIssuer Trust to the United States or any other\ntaxing authority. Additional Amounts If a tax\nevent has occurred while the property trustee\nholds any corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities and the Issuer Trust is required to\npay any taxes, duties, assessments or\ngovernmental charges of whatever nature, other\nthan withholding taxes, imposed by the United\nStates, or any other taxing authority, then we\nwill be required to pay additional amounts on\nthe corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities. The amount of any additional\namounts will be an amount sufficient so that\nthe net amounts received and retained by the\nIssuer Trust after paying any such taxes,\nduties, assessments or other governmental\ncharges will be not less than the amounts the\nIssuer Trust would have received had no such\ntaxes, duties, assessments or other\ngovernmental charges been imposed. This means\nthat the Issuer Trust will be in the same\nposition it would have been if it did not have\nto pay such taxes, duties, assessments or\nother charges. Modification of the\nSubordinated Debt Indenture As long as\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities are\nheld by or on behalf of the Issuer Trust, no\nmodification may be made that adversely\naffects the holders of such series of capital\nsecurities in any material respect, and no\ntermination of the subordinated debt indenture\nmay occur, and no waiver of any event of\ndefault under the subordinated debt indenture\nwith respect to such series of capital\nsecurities may be effective, without the prior\nconsent of the holders of at least a majority\nof the aggregate liquidation amount of all\noutstanding capital securities of such series\naffected, unless and until the principal of\nthe corresponding subordinated debt securities\nand all accrued and unpaid interest have been\npaid in full and certain other conditions have\nbeen satisfied. If a consent under the\nsubordinated debt indenture would require the\nconsent of each holder of a series of\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities, no\nsuch consent will be given by the property\ntrustee without the prior consent of each\nholder of the capital securities affected. 35\n\nThe following modifications and amendments to\nthe subordinated debt indenture require the\nconsent of each holder of outstanding\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities of\na series (and thus require the consent of each\nholder of capital securities of the Issuer\nTrust holding such corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities):\n                                              \n      a change in the stated maturity date    \n      of any payment of principal or          \n      interest, or a reduction in the         \n      principal amount                        \n      thereof or the rate of interest         \n      thereon;

The same majority\napproval would be required for us to obtain a\nwaiver of any of our covenants in the\nsubordinated debt indenture. We may not amend\nthe subordinated debt indenture to alter the\nsubordination of any outstanding corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities without the\nwritten consent of each holder of senior\nindebtedness then outstanding who would be\nadversely affected. In addition, we may not\nmodify the subordination provisions of the\nsubordinated debt indenture in a manner that\nwould adversely affect the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities of any one or\nmore series then outstanding in any material\nrespect, without the consent of the holders of\na majority in aggregate principal amount of\nthe corresponding subordinated debt securities\nof that series then outstanding. Enforcement\nof Certain Rights by Holders of Capital\nSecurities If an event of default with respect\nto a series of corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities has occurred and is continuing and\nthe event is attributable to our failure to\npay interest or principal on the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities on the date the\ninterest or principal is due and payable (and\nafter a 30-daygrace period for interest\ndefaults), a holder of the related capital\nsecurities may institute a legal proceeding\ndirectly against us for enforcement of payment\nto that holder of the principal of or interest\non corresponding subordinated debt securities\nhaving a principal amount equal to the\naggregate liquidation amount of the related\ncapital securities of that holder (a \u0093direct\naction\u0094). We may not amend the subordinated\ndebt indenture to remove this right to bring a\ndirect action without the prior written\nconsent of the holders of all of the related\ncapital securities outstanding and affected.\nWe will have the right under the subordinated\ndebt indenture to set-offany payment made to a\nholder of the related capital securities by us\nin connection with a direct action. The\nholders of at least 25% in aggregate\nliquidation amount of any series of\noutstanding capital securities may, by giving\nnotice in writing to us and the subordinated\ndebt trustee, accelerate the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities with respect to\nsuch series upon the occurrence and during the\ncontinuance of an event of default under the\nsubordinated debt indenture with respect to\nsuch subordinated debt securities (other than\nan event of default arising from our filing\nfor bankruptcy or the occurrence of other\nevents of bankruptcy, insolvency or\nreorganization relating to us), if the holders\nof the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities or the subordinated debt trustee\nhave not done so. See \u0093\u0097 Events of Default;\nNotice\u0094 above for a description of the events\nof default under the subordinated debt\nindenture. The holders of a majority in\nliquidation amount of all outstanding capital\nsecurities of a series may, on behalf of all\nholders of that series, waive any past default\nunder the subordinated debt indenture with\nrespect to the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities, except any default in the payment\nof principal, premium or interest with respect\nto those debt securities or a non-\npaymentdefault with respect to a provision of\nthat subordinated debt indenture that cannot\nbe modified without the consent of the holder\nof each of those debt securities affected. 37\n\nThe holders of related capital securities will\nnot be able to exercise directly any remedies\nor take any action available to the holders of\nthe corresponding subordinated debt securities\nother than those set forth in the three\npreceding paragraphs. Guarantee and Expense\nAgreement The following description summarizes\nthe material provisions of the guarantee and\nthe agreement as to expenses and liabilities.\nThis description is not complete and is\nsubject to, and is qualified in its entirety\nby reference to, all of the provisions of the\nguarantee and the expense agreement, including\nthe definitions therein, and the Trust\nIndenture Act of 1939. The form of the\nguarantee and the expense agreement have been\nfiled as an exhibit to our registration\nstatement. Reference in this summary to\ncapital securities means the capital\nsecurities issued by the Issuer Trust.\nWhenever particular defined terms of the\nguarantee or expense agreements are referred\nto in this prospectus, those defined terms are\nincorporated in this prospectus by reference.\nThe Guarantee The guarantee was executed and\ndelivered by us at the same time the Issuer\nTrust issued its capital securities. The\nguarantee is for the benefit of the holders\nfrom time to time of the capital securities.\nThe Bank of New York Mellon will act as\nindenture trustee (referred to below as the\n\u0093guarantee trustee\u0094) under the guarantee for\nthe purposes of compliance with the Trust\nIndenture Act of 1939 and the guarantee is\nqualified as an indenture under the Trust\nIndenture Act of 1939. The guarantee trustee\nholds the guarantee for the benefit of the\nholders of the Issuer Trust\u0092s capital\nsecurities. We irrevocably and unconditionally\nagree to pay in full on a subordinated basis,\nto the extent described below, the guarantee\npayments (as defined below) to the holders of\nthe capital securities, as and when due,\nregardless of any defense that the Issuer\nTrust may have or assert other than the\ndefense of payment. The following payments or\ndistributions with respect to the capital\nsecurities, to the extent not paid by or on\nbehalf of the Issuer Trust (referred to as the\n\u0093guarantee payments\u0094), will be subject to the\nguarantee:\n                                              \n      any accumulated and unpaid              \n      distributions required to be paid on    \n      the capital securities, to the extent   \n      that the Issuer Trust                   \n      has funds legally and immediately       \n      available to pay them;                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      any redemption price required to be     \n      paid on the capital securities, to the  \n      extent that the Issuer Trust has funds  \n      legally                                 \n      and immediately available to pay it;    \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      upon a voluntary or involuntary         \n      termination, winding up or liquidation  \n      of the Issuer Trust (unless the         \n      corresponding                           \n      subordinated debt securities are        \n      distributed to holders of the capital   \n      securities in exchange for their        \n      capital securities), the lesser of:     \n                                              \n                                              \n      the aggregate of the $1,000             \n      liquidation amount and all accumulated  \n      and unpaid distributions on the         \n      capital securities to                   \n      the date of payment, to the extent the  \n      Issuer Trust has funds available to     \n      make the payment; and                   \n                                              \n                                              \n      the amount of assets of the Issuer      \n      Trust remaining available for           \n      distribution to holders of capital      \n      securities after                        \n      satisfaction of liabilities to          \n      creditors of the Issuer Trust as        \n      required by applicable law.             \n                                              \nOur obligation to make a guarantee payment may\nbe satisfied by direct payment of the required\namounts by us to the holders of the applicable\ncapital securities or by causing the Issuer\nTrust to pay these amounts to the holders. The\nguarantee is an irrevocable and unconditional\nguarantee on a subordinated basis of the\nIssuer Trust\u0092s obligations under the capital\nsecurities, but will apply only to the extent\nthat the Issuer 38\n\nTrust has funds sufficient to make such\npayments, and is not a guarantee of\ncollection. If we do not pay any amounts on\nthe corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities, holders of the capital\nsecurities will have to rely on the\nenforcement by the property trustee of the\ntrustee\u0092s rights as registered holder of the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities, or\nproceed directly against us for payment of any\namounts due on the capital\nsecurities. See \u0093\u0097 Status of the Guarantee\u0094\nbelow.\n\nIf and to the extent we do not make payments\non the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities held by the Issuer Trust, the\nIssuer Trust will not be able to make payments\non the capital securities and will not have\nfunds available to do so. The guarantee\nconstitutes an unsecured obligation of ours\nand will rank subordinate\nand junior in right of payment to all of our\nsenior indebtedness. See \u0093\u0097 Status of the\nGuarantee\u0094 below. Because we are a holding\ncompany, our right to participate in any\ndistribution of assets of any subsidiary upon\nsuch\nsubsidiary\u0092s liquidation or reorganization or\notherwise is subject to the prior claims of\ncreditors of that subsidiary, except to the\nextent we may ourselves be recognized as a\ncreditor of that subsidiary. Accordingly, our\nobligations under the\nguarantee will be effectively subordinated to\nall existing and future liabilities of our\nsubsidiaries, and claimants should look only\nto our assets for payments. The guarantee does\nnot limit the incurrence or issuance of other\nsecured or unsecured\ndebt of ours, including senior indebtedness,\nwhether under the subordinated debt indenture,\nany other existing debt indenture or any other\nindenture that we may enter into in the future\nor otherwise.\n\nWe have, through the guarantee, the trust\nagreement, the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities, the subordinated debt indenture\nand the applicable\nexpense agreement, taken together, fully,\nirrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed all\nof the Issuer Trust\u0092s obligations under the\ncapital securities. No single document\nstanding alone or operating in conjunction\nwith fewer than all of the\nother documents constitutes a guarantee. It is\nonly the combined operation of these documents\nthat has the effect of providing a full,\nirrevocable and unconditional guarantee of the\nIssuer Trust\u0092s obligations under its capital\nsecurities. See\n\u0093Relationship Among the Capital Securities and\nthe Related Instruments\u0094 below.\n\nStatus of the Guarantee\n\nThe guarantee constitutes an unsecured\nobligation of ours and is subordinated in\nright of payment to all of our senior\nindebtedness in the same manner as\nthe corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities. See \u0093Corresponding Subordinated\nDebt Securities \u0097 Subordination\u0094 above.\n\nThe\nguarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment\nand not of collection (i.e., the guaranteed\nparty may institute a legal proceeding\ndirectly against us to enforce its rights\nunder the guarantee without first instituting\na legal proceeding against\nany other person or entity). The guarantee is\nheld for the benefit of the holders of the\ncapital securities. The guarantee will not be\ndischarged except by payment of the guarantee\npayments in full to the extent not paid by the\nIssuer Trust or upon\ndistribution to the holders of the capital\nsecurities of the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities. The guarantee does not place\na limitation on the amount of additional\nsenior indebtedness that may be incurred by\nus. We expect from time to\ntime to incur additional indebtedness\nconstituting senior indebtedness.\n\nAmendments and Assignment\n\nExcept with respect to any changes which do\nnot materially adversely affect the material\nrights of holders of the capital securities\n(in which case no\nvote of the holders will be required), no\nguarantee may be amended without the prior\napproval of the holders of a majority of the\nrelated outstanding capital securities. The\nmanner of obtaining any such approval will be\nas described above under\n\u0093\u0097 Voting Rights; Amendment of The Trust\nagreement\u0094. All guarantees and agreements\ncontained in the guarantee will bind our\nsuccessors, assigns, receivers, trustees and\nrepresentatives and will inure to\n\n39\n\nthe benefit of the holders of the capital\nsecurities then outstanding. We may not assign\nour obligations under the guarantees except in\nconnection with a consolidation, merger or\namalgamation, or sale of all or substantially\nall of our assets, involving us that is\npermitted under the terms of the subordinated\ndebt indenture. Events of Default An event of\ndefault under the guarantee will occur upon\nour failure to perform any of our payment\nobligations under the guarantee or to perform\nany non-paymentobligations if this non-\npaymentdefault remains unremedied for 30 days.\nThe holders of a majority of the capital\nsecurities then outstanding have the right to\ndirect the time, method and place of\nconducting any proceeding for any remedy\navailable to the guarantee trustee in respect\nof the guarantee or to direct the exercise of\nany trust or power conferred upon the\nguarantee trustee under the guarantee. We, as\nguarantor, are required to file annually with\nthe guarantee trustee a certificate as to\nwhether or not we are in compliance with all\nthe conditions and covenants applicable to us\nunder the guarantee. Information Concerning\nthe Guarantee Trustee The guarantee trustee,\nother than during the occurrence and\ncontinuance of a default by us in performance\nof any guarantee, undertakes to perform only\nthose duties specifically set forth in the\nguarantee and, after default with respect to\nany guarantee, must exercise the same degree\nof care and skill as a prudent person would\nexercise or use in the conduct of his or her\nown affairs. Subject to this provision, the\nguarantee trustee is under no obligation to\nexercise any of the powers vested in it by the\nguarantee at the request of any holder of the\ncapital securities unless it is offered\nreasonable indemnity against the costs,\nexpenses and liabilities that might be\nincurred as a result. Termination of the\nGuarantee The guarantee will terminate and be\nof no further force and effect upon:\n                                              \n      the guarantee payments having been      \n      paid in full by us, the trust or both;  \n      or                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      the distribution of corresponding       \n      subordinated debt securities to the     \n      holders of the related capital          \n      securities in exchange                  \n      for their capital securities.           \n                                              \nThe guarantee will continue to be effective or\nwill be reinstated, as the case may be, if at\nany time any holder of the capital securities\nmust restore payment of any sums paid under\nthe capital securities or the guarantee in\nconnection with a bankruptcy, insolvency, or\nsimilar proceeding involving the Issuer Trust.\nGoverning Law The guarantee will be governed\nby and construed in accordance with the laws\nof the State of New York. The Expense\nAgreement Pursuant to the expense agreement\nthat was entered into by us under the trust\nagreement, we irrevocably and unconditionally\nguarantee to each person or entity to whom the\nIssuer Trust becomes indebted or liable the\nfull payment of any costs, expenses or\nliabilities of the Issuer Trust, other than\nobligations of the Issuer Trust to pay to the\nholders of any capital securities or other\nsimilar interests in the Issuer Trust the\namounts owed to holders pursuant to the terms\nof the capital securities or other similar\ninterests, as the case may be. The expense\nagreement will be enforceable by third\nparties. 40\n\nOur obligations under the expense agreement\nare subordinated in right of payment to the\nsame extent as the guarantee. Our obligations\nunder the expense agreement are subject to\nprovisions regarding amendment, termination,\nassignment, succession and governing law\nsimilar to those applicable to the guarantee.\nRelationship Among the Capital Securities and\nthe Related Instruments The following\ndescription of the relationship among the\ncapital securities, the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities, the expense\nagreement and the guarantee is not complete\nand is subject to, and is qualified in its\nentirety by reference to, the trust agreement,\nthe subordinated debt indenture, which is\nincorporated as an exhibit to our SEC\nregistration statement, and the Trust\nIndenture Act of 1939. Full and Unconditional\nGuarantee Payments of distributions and other\namounts due on the capital securities (to the\nextent the Issuer Trust has funds available\nfor the payment of such distributions) are\nirrevocably guaranteed by us as described\nabove under \u0093\u0097 Guarantee and Expense Agreement\n\u0097 The Guarantee\u0094. Taken together, our\nobligations under the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities, the subordinated\ndebt indenture, the trust agreement, the\nexpense agreement, and the guarantee provide,\nin the aggregate, a full, irrevocable and\nunconditional guarantee of payments of\ndistributions and other amounts due on the\ncapital securities. No single document\nstanding alone or operating in conjunction\nwith fewer than all of the other documents\nconstitutes a guarantee. It is only the\ncombined operation of these documents that has\nthe effect of providing a full, irrevocable\nand unconditional guarantee of the Issuer\nTrust\u0092s obligations under the capital\nsecurities. If and to the extent that we do\nnot make payments on the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities, the Issuer Trust\nwill not pay distributions or other amounts\ndue on its capital securities. The guarantee\ndoes not cover payment of any amounts when the\nIssuer Trust does not have sufficient funds to\npay such amounts. In such an event, the remedy\nof a holder of any capital securities is to\ninstitute a legal proceeding directly against\nus pursuant to the terms of the subordinated\ndebt indenture for enforcement of our\nobligations under the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities. Our obligations\nunder the guarantee are subordinate and junior\nin right of payment to all of our senior\nindebtedness. If we make payment on the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities and\nthe Issuer Trust has funds available to make\npayments on its capital securities but fails\nto do so, a holder of such capital securities\nmay begin a legal proceeding against us to\nenforce our obligations under the guarantee to\nmake these payments or to cause the Issuer\nTrust to make these payments. In the event the\nIssuer Trust receives payments on the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities,\nbut these funds are available for payment on\nthe capital securities only after claims made\nby creditors of the trust are paid, we would\nbe obligated under the expense agreement to\npay those claims. Sufficiency of Payments As\nlong as payments of interest and other\npayments are made when due on the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities,\nsuch payments will be sufficient to cover\ndistributions and other payments due on the\ncapital securities, primarily because:\n                                              \n      the aggregate principal amount of the   \n      corresponding subordinated debt         \n      securities will be equal to the sum of  \n      the aggregate                           \n      stated liquidation amount of the        \n      capital securities and trust common     \n      securities;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      the interest rate and interest and      \n      other payment dates on the              \n      corresponding subordinated debt         \n      securities will match the               \n      distribution rate and distribution and  \n      other payment dates for the capital     \n      securities;                             \n                                              \n41\n                                              \n      we will pay, under the expense          \n      agreement, for all and any costs,       \n      expenses and liabilities of the Issuer  \n      Trust except the                        \n      Issuer Trust\u0092s obligations to holders    \n      of its capital securities under the     \n      capital securities; and                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      the trust agreement provides that the   \n      Issuer Trust will not engage in any     \n      activity that is inconsistent with the  \n      limited                                 \n      purposes of the Issuer Trust.           \n                                              \nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in\nthe subordinated debt indenture, we have the\nright to set-offany payment we are otherwise\nrequired to make under the subordinated debt\nindenture with a payment we make under the\nguarantee. Enforcement Rights of Holders of\nCapital Securities A holder of any capital\nsecurity may, to the extent permissible under\napplicable law, institute a legal proceeding\ndirectly against us to enforce its rights\nunder the subordinated debt indenture or the\nguarantee without first instituting a legal\nproceeding against the guarantee trustee, the\nIssuer Trust or any other person or entity. A\ndefault or event of default under any of our\nsenior indebtedness would not constitute a\ndefault or event of default with respect to\nany capital securities or the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities. In the event of\npayment defaults under, or acceleration of, or\ndefaults that permit acceleration of, our\nsenior indebtedness, or acceleration of the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities,\nthe subordination provisions of the\nsubordinated debt indenture provide that no\npayments may be made in respect of the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities\nuntil the senior indebtedness has been paid in\nfull or any payment default has been cured or\nwaived. Limited Purpose of the Issuer Trust\nThe Issuer Trust\u0092s capital securities evidence\na preferred and undivided beneficial interest\nin the Issuer Trust, and the Issuer Trust\nexists for the sole purpose of issuing its\ncapital securities and trust common securities\nand investing the proceeds thereof in\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities and\nengaging in only those other activities\nnecessary or incidental thereto. A principal\ndifference between the rights of a holder of a\ncapital security and a holder of the\ncorresponding subordinated debt security is\nthat a holder of a corresponding subordinated\ndebt security is entitled to receive from us\nthe principal amount of and interest accrued\non corresponding subordinated debt securities\nheld, while a holder of capital securities is\nentitled to receive distributions from the\nIssuer Trust (or from us under the guarantee)\nif and to the extent the Issuer Trust has\nfunds available for the payment of such\ndistributions. Rights Upon Dissolution Upon\nany voluntary or involuntary dissolution of\nthe Issuer Trust (except in connection with\nthe redemption of all capital securities), the\nholders of the capital securities will be\nentitled to receive a like amount of\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities in\nexchange for their capital securities, subject\nto prior satisfaction of liabilities to\ncreditors of the trust. If the property\ntrustee determines that a distribution of\nsubordinated debt securities is not practical,\nthe holders of capital securities will be\nentitled to receive a liquidation distribution\nout of the assets held by the trust after\nsatisfaction of those liabilities. See \u0093\u0097\nLiquidation Distribution Upon Dissolution\u0094\nabove. Upon any voluntary or involuntary\nliquidation or bankruptcy of ours, the\nproperty trustee, as holder of the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities,\nwould be a subordinated creditor of ours,\nsubordinated in right of payment to all senior\nindebtedness as set forth in the subordinated\ndebt indenture, but entitled to receive\npayment in full of principal and interest,\nbefore any stockholders of ours receive\npayments or distributions. Since we are 42\n\nthe guarantor under the guarantee and have\nagreed, under the expense agreement, to pay\nfor all costs, expenses and liabilities of the\nIssuer Trust (other than the Issuer Trust\u0092s\nobligations\nto the holders of its capital securities), the\npositions of a holder of the capital\nsecurities and a holder of the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities relative to other\ncreditors and to our stockholders in the event\nof our liquidation or\nbankruptcy are expected to be substantially\nthe same.\n\nNotices\n\nNotices to be given to holders of a global\ncapital security will be given only to the\ndepositary, in accordance with its applicable\npolicies as in effect\nfrom time to time. Notices to be given to\nholders of any capital securities not in\nglobal form will be sent by mail to the\nrespective addresses of the holders as they\nappear in the trustee\u0092s records, and will be\ndeemed given when mailed.\nNeither the failure to give any notice to a\nparticular holder, nor any defect in a notice\ngiven to a particular holder, will affect the\nsufficiency of any notice given to another\nholder.\n\nBook-entry and other indirect owners should\nconsult their banks or brokers for information\non how they will receive notices.\n\n43\n\nLEGAL OWNERSHIP AND BOOK-ENTRY ISSUANCE\n\nIn this section, we describe special\nconsiderations that will apply to registered\nsecurities issued in global \u0097i.e., book-entry\n\u0097 form.\nFirst we describe the difference between legal\nownership and indirect ownership of registered\nsecurities. Then we describe special\nprovisions that apply to global securities.\n\nWho Is the Legal Owner of a Registered\nSecurity?\n\nEach capital security in registered form will\nbe represented either by a certificate issued\nin definitive form to a particular investor or\nby one or more\nglobal securities representing the entire\nissuance of securities. We refer to those who\nhave capital securities registered in their\nown names, on the books that we or the trustee\nmaintain for this purpose, as the \u0093holders\u0094 of\nthose capital\nsecurities. These persons are the legal\nholders of the capital securities. We refer to\nthose who, indirectly through others, own\nbeneficial interests in capital securities\nthat are not registered in their own names as\nindirect owners of those\ncapital securities. As we discuss below,\nindirect owners are not legal holders, and\ninvestors in capital securities issued in\nbook-entry form or in street name will be\nindirect owners.\n\nBook-Entry Owners\n\nThe Issuer Trust will issue each\ncapital security in book-entry form only. This\nmeans capital securities will be represented\nby one or more global securities registered in\nthe name of a financial institution that holds\nthem as depositary on behalf of other\nfinancial institutions\nthat participate in the depositary\u0092s book-\nentry system. These participating\ninstitutions, in turn, hold beneficial\ninterests in the capital securities on behalf\nof themselves or their customers.\n\nFor capital securities issued in global form,\nthe Issuer Trust will recognize only the\ndepositary as the holder of the capital\nsecurities and the Issuer\nTrust will make all payments on the capital\nsecurities to the depositary. The depositary\npasses along the payments it receives to its\nparticipants, which in turn pass the payments\nalong to their customers who are the\nbeneficial owners. The\ndepositary and its participants do so under\nagreements they have made with one another or\nwith their customers; they are not obligated\nto do so under the terms of the capital\nsecurities.\n\nAs a result, investors will not own capital\nsecurities directly. Instead, they will own\nbeneficial interests in a global security,\nthrough a bank,\nbroker or other financial institution that\nparticipates in the depositary\u0092s book-entry\nsystem or holds an interest through a\nparticipant. As long as the capital securities\nare issued in global form, investors will be\nindirect owners, and not\nholders, of the securities.\n\nStreet Name Owners\n\nIn the future the Issuer Trust may terminate a\nglobal security and issue capital securities\nin non-global form.\nIn that case, investors may choose to hold\ntheir capital securities in their own names or\nin street name. Capital securities held by an\ninvestor in street name would be registered in\nthe name of a bank, broker or other financial\ninstitution that the\ninvestor chooses, and the investor would hold\nonly a beneficial interest in those capital\nsecurities through an account he or she\nmaintains at that institution.\n\nFor capital securities held in street name,\nthe Issuer Trust will recognize only the\nintermediary banks, brokers and other\nfinancial institutions in\nwhose names the capital securities are\nregistered as the holders of those capital\nsecurities and the Issuer Trust will make all\npayments on those capital securities to them.\nThese institutions pass along the payments\nthey receive to their customers\nwho are the beneficial owners, but only\nbecause they agree to do so in their customer\nagreements or because they are legally\nrequired to do so. Investors who hold capital\nsecurities in street name will be indirect\nowners, not holders, of those\nsecurities.\n\n44\n\nLegal Holders Our obligations, the obligations\nof the Issuer Trust, as well as the\nobligations of the trustee under the indenture\nand any other third parties employed by us or\nthe trustee, run only to the holders of the\ncapital securities. Neither we nor the Issuer\nTrust have obligations to investors who hold\nbeneficial interests in global securities, in\nstreet name or by any other indirect means.\nThis will be the case whether an investor\nchooses to be an indirect owner of a capital\nsecurity or has no choice because the Issuer\nTrust is issuing the capital securities only\nin global form. For example, once the Issuer\nTrust makes a payment or gives a notice to the\nholder, the Issuer Trust has no further\nresponsibility for that payment or notice even\nif that holder is required, under agreements\nwith depositary participants or customers or\nby law, to pass it along to the indirect\nowners but does not do so. Similarly, if the\nIssuer Trust wants to obtain the approval of\nthe holders for any purpose \u0097 e.g., to amend\nthe amended and restated trust declaration or\nto relieve us of the consequences of a default\nor of our obligation to comply with a\nparticular provision of the indenture \u0097 the\nIssuer Trust would seek the approval only from\nthe holders, and not the indirect owners, of\nthe capital securities. Whether and how the\nholders contact the indirect owners is up to\nthe holders. Special Considerations for\nIndirect Owners If you hold capital securities\nthrough a bank, broker or other financial\ninstitution, either in book-entry form or in\nstreet name, you should check with your own\ninstitution to find out:\n                                              \n      how it handles securities payments and  \n      notices;                                \n                                              \n                                           \n      whether it imposes fees or charges;  \n                                           \n                                              \n      how it would handle a request for the   \n      holders\u0092 consent, if ever required;      \n                                              \n                                              \n      whether and how you can instruct it to  \n      send you capital securities registered  \n      in your own name so you can be a        \n      holder, if                              \n      that is permitted in the future;        \n                                              \n                                              \n      how it would exercise rights under the  \n      capital securities if there were a      \n      default or other event triggering the   \n      need for                                \n      holders to act to protect their         \n      interests; and                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      if the capital securities are in        \n      book-entry form, how the depositary\u0092s    \n      rules and procedures will affect these  \n      matters.                                \n                                              \nWhat Is a Global Security? The Issuer Trust\nwill issue each capital security in book-entry\nform only. Each capital security issued in\nbook-entry form will be represented by a\nglobal security that the Issuer Trust deposits\nwith and registers in the name of one or more\nfinancial institutions or clearing systems, or\ntheir nominees, which we select. A financial\ninstitution or clearing system that the Issuer\nTrust selects for any capital security for\nthis purpose is called the \u0093depositary\u0094 for\nthat capital security. The initial depositary\nwill be The Depository Trust Company, New\nYork, New York, which is known as \u0093DTC.\u0094\nInvestors may also hold beneficial interests\nin a global security through Euroclear Bank\nSA/NV, which is known as \u0093Euroclear\u0094 or\nClearstream Banking, soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme, which is\nknown as \u0093Clearstream,\u0094 as DTC participants. A\nglobal security may not be transferred to or\nregistered in the name of anyone other than\nthe depositary or its nominee, unless special\ntermination situations arise. We describe\nthose situations below under \u0093\u0097 Special\nSituations When a Global Security Will Be\nTerminated.\u0094 If termination occurs, the Issuer\nTrust may issue the capital securities through\nanother book-entry clearing system or the\ncapital securities may no longer be held\nthrough any book-entry clearing system. 45\n\nThe depositary, or its nominee, will be the\nsole registered owner and holder of all\ncapital securities represented by a global\nsecurity, and investors will be permitted to\nown only indirect interests in a global\nsecurity. Indirect interests must be held by\nmeans of an account with a broker, bank or\nother financial institution that in turn has\nan account with the depositary or with another\ninstitution that does. Thus, an investor whose\ncapital security is represented by a global\nsecurity will not be a holder of the capital\nsecurity, but only an indirect owner of an\ninterest in the global security. Special\nConsiderations for Global Securities As an\nindirect owner, an investor\u0092s rights relating\nto a global security will be governed by the\naccount rules of the depositary and those of\nthe investor\u0092s financial institution or other\nintermediary through which it holds its\ninterest ( e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream, if\nDTC is the depositary), as well as general\nlaws relating to securities transfers. The\nIssuer Trust do not recognize this type of\ninvestor or any intermediary as a holder of\ncapital securities and instead deal only with\nthe depositary that holds the global security.\nBecause the capital securities will be issued\nonly in the form of a global security, an\ninvestor should be aware of the following:\n                                              \n      An investor cannot cause the capital    \n      securities to be registered in his or   \n      her own name, and cannot obtain         \n      non-global certificates for his or her  \n      interest in the capital securities,     \n      except in the special situations we     \n      describe below;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      An investor will be an indirect holder  \n      and must look to his or her own bank    \n      or broker for payments on the capital   \n      securities and protection of his or     \n      her legal rights relating to the        \n      capital securities, as we describe      \n      above under \u0093\u0097 Who Is the Legal Owner of  \n      a Registered Security?\u0094;                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      An investor may not be able to sell     \n      interests in the capital securities to  \n      some insurance companies and other      \n      institutions                            \n      that are required by law to own         \n      securities in non-book-entry form;      \n                                              \n                                              \n      An investor may not be able to pledge   \n      his or her interest in a global         \n      security in circumstances where         \n      certificates                            \n      representing the capital securities     \n      must be delivered to the lender or      \n      other beneficiary of the pledge in      \n      order for the pledge to be effective;   \n                                              \n                                              \n      The depositary\u0092s policies will govern    \n      payments, deliveries, transfers,        \n      exchanges, notices and other matters    \n      relating                                \n      to an investor\u0092s interest in a global    \n      security, and those policies may        \n      change from time to time. We, the       \n      Issuer Trust and the trustees will      \n      have no responsibility for any aspect   \n      of the depositary\u0092s policies, actions    \n      or records of ownership                 \n      interests in a global security. We,     \n      the Issuer Trust and the trustees also  \n      do not supervise the depositary in any  \n      way;                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      The depositary will require that those  \n      who purchase and sell interests in a    \n      global security within its book-entry   \n      system                                  \n      use immediately available funds and     \n      your broker or bank may require you to  \n      do so as well; and                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      Financial institutions that             \n      participate in the depositary\u0092s          \n      book-entry system and through which an  \n      investor holds its                      \n      interest in the global securities,      \n      directly or indirectly, may also have   \n      their own policies affecting payments,  \n      deliveries, transfers, exchanges,       \n      notices and other matters relating to   \n      the global securities, and those        \n      policies may change from time to        \n      time. For example, if you hold an       \n      interest in a global security through   \n      Euroclear or Clearstream, when DTC is   \n      the depositary, Euroclear or            \n      Clearstream, as applicable, will        \n      require those who purchase and sell     \n      interests in that global security       \n      through                                 \n      them to use immediately available       \n      funds and comply with other policies    \n      and procedures, including deadlines     \n      for giving                              \n                                              \n46\n                                              \n  instructions as to transactions that are    \n  to be effected on a particular day. There   \n  may be more than one financial              \n  intermediary in the chain of ownership for  \n  an investor. The Issuer Trust do not        \n  monitor and are not responsible for the     \n  policies or actions or records of           \n  ownership interests of any of those         \n  intermediaries.                             \n                                              \nSpecial Situations When a Global Security Will\nBe Terminated In a few special situations\ndescribed below, a global security will be\nterminated and interests in it will be\nexchanged for certificates in non-globalform\nrepresenting the capital securities it\nrepresented. After that exchange, the choice\nof whether to hold the capital securities\ndirectly or in street name will be up to the\ninvestor. Investors must consult their own\nbanks or brokers to find out how to have their\ninterests in a global security transferred on\ntermination to their own names, so that they\nwill be holders. We have described the rights\nof holders and street name investors above\nunder \u0093\u0097 Who Is the Legal Owner of a\nRegistered Security?\u0094. The special situations\nfor termination of a global security are as\nfollows:\n                                              \n      if the depositary notifies us and the   \n      Issuer Trust that it is unwilling,      \n      unable or no longer qualified to        \n      continue as                             \n      depositary for that global security     \n      and we do not appoint another           \n      institution to act as depositary        \n      within 60 days;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      if we notify the depositary that we     \n      wish to terminate that global security  \n      and we do not appoint another           \n      institution to act                      \n      as depositary within 60 days; or        \n                                              \n                                              \n      if an event of default has occurred     \n      with regard to the corresponding        \n      subordinated debt securities under the  \n      indenture and                           \n      has not been cured or waived.           \n                                              \nDTC\u0092s current rules provide that it would\nnotify its participants of a request by us or\nthe Issuer Trust to terminate a global\nsecurity, but will only withdraw beneficial\ninterests from the global security at the\nrequest of each DTC participant. If a global\nsecurity is terminated, only the depositary,\nand not we, the Issuer Trust or the trustees\nis responsible for deciding the names of the\ninstitutions in whose names the capital\nsecurities represented by the global security\nwill be registered and, therefore, who will be\nthe holders of those capital securities.\nConsiderations Relating to Euroclear and\nClearstream Euroclear and Clearstream are\nsecurities clearing systems in Europe. Both\nsystems clear and settle securities\ntransactions between their participants\nthrough electronic, book-entry delivery of\nsecurities against payment. Euroclear and\nClearstream may be depositaries for a global\nsecurity. In addition, Euroclear and\nClearstream may hold interests in a global\nsecurity as participants in DTC. As long as\nany global security is held by Euroclear or\nClearstream as depositary, you may hold an\ninterest in the global security only through\nan organization that participates, directly or\nindirectly, in Euroclear or Clearstream. If\nEuroclear or Clearstream is the depositary for\na global security and there is no depositary\nin the United States, you will not be able to\nhold interests in that global security through\nany securities clearance system in the United\nStates. Payments, deliveries, transfers,\nexchanges, notices and other matters relating\nto the capital securities made through\nEuroclear or Clearstream must comply with the\nrules and procedures of those 47\n\nsystems. Those clearing systems could change\ntheir rules and procedures at any time.\nNeither we nor the Issuer Trust have control\nover those systems or their participants, and\nneither we nor the\nIssuer Trust take responsibility for their\nactivities. Transactions between participants\nin Euroclear or Clearstream, on one hand, and\nparticipants in DTC, on the other hand, when\nDTC is the depositary, would also be subject\nto DTC\u0092s rules and\nprocedures.\n\nSpecial Timing Considerations for Transactions\nin Euroclear and Clearstream\n\nInvestors will be able to make and receive\nthrough Euroclear and Clearstream payments,\ndeliveries, transfers, exchanges, notices and\nother transactions\ninvolving any capital securities held through\nthose clearing systems only on days when those\nsystems are open for business. Those clearing\nsystems may not be open for business on days\nwhen banks, brokers and other institutions are\nopen for business\nin the United States.\n\nIn addition, because of time-zone differences,\nU.S. investors who hold their interests in the\ncapital securities through\nthese clearing systems and wish to transfer\ntheir interests, or to receive or make a\npayment or delivery or exercise any other\nright with respect to their interests, on a\nparticular day may find that the transaction\nwill not be effected until the\nnext business day in Luxembourg or Brussels,\nas applicable. Thus, investors who wish to\nexercise rights that expire on a particular\nday may need to act before the expiration\ndate. In addition, investors who hold their\ninterests through both DTC and\nEuroclear or Clearstream may need to make\nspecial arrangements to finance any purchases\nor sales of their interests between the U.S.\nand European clearing systems, and those\ntransactions may settle later than would be\nthe case for transactions\nwithin one clearing system.\n\n48\n\nUNITED STATES TAXATION This section describes\nthe material United States federal income tax\nconsequences to the purchase, ownership and\ndisposition of the capital securities. The\nfollowing discussion only addresses the tax\nconsequences to a holder that holds the\ncapital securities as a capital asset for tax\npurposes. This section addresses only United\nStates federal income taxation and does not\ndiscuss all of the tax consequences that may\nbe relevant to you in light of your individual\ncircumstances, including foreign, state or\nlocal tax consequences, and tax consequences\narising under the Medicare contribution tax on\nnet investment income or the alternative\nminimum tax. This section does not apply to\nyou if you are a member of a class of holders\nsubject to special rules, such as:\n                                             \n      a dealer in securities or currencies;  \n                                             \n                                              \n      a trader in securities that elects to   \n      use a                                   \n      mark-to-market method of accounting     \n      for your capital securities holdings;   \n                                              \n               \n      a bank;  \n               \n                                 \n      a life insurance company;  \n                                 \n                             \n      a thrift institution;  \n                             \n                                       \n      a regulated investment company;  \n                                       \n                                  \n      a tax-exempt organization;  \n                                  \n                                              \n      a person that owns offered capital      \n      securities that are a hedge or that     \n      are hedged against interest rate or     \n      currency risks;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      a person that purchases or sells the    \n      offered capital securities as part of   \n      a wash-sale for tax purposes;           \n                                              \n                                              \n      a person that owns offered capital      \n      securities as part of a straddle or     \n      conversion transaction for tax          \n      purposes; or                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      a United States holder (as defined      \n      below) whose functional currency for    \n      tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar.    \n                                              \nThis section is based on the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended, its\nlegislative history, existing and proposed\nregulations under the Internal Revenue Code,\npublished rulings and court decisions, all as\ncurrently in effect. These laws are subject to\nchange, possibly on a retroactive basis. If an\nentity or arrangement that is treated as a\npartnership for United States federal income\ntax purposes holds the capital securities, the\nUnited States federal income tax treatment of\na partner will generally depend on the status\nof the partner and the tax treatment of the\npartnership. A partner in a partnership\nholding the capital securities should consult\nits tax advisor with regard to the United\nStates federal income tax treatment of an\ninvestment in the capital securities. The\nauthorities on which this discussion is based\nare subject to various interpretations, and it\nis therefore possible that the federal income\ntax treatment of the purchase, ownership and\ndisposition of capital securities may differ\nfrom the treatment described below. Please\nconsult your own tax advisor concerning the\nconsequences of owning the capital securities\nin your particular circumstances under the\nInternal Revenue Code and the laws of any\nother taxing jurisdiction. 49\n\nClassification of the Issuer Trust Under\ncurrent law and the trust agreement, the\nIssuer Trust will not be taxable as a\ncorporation for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. As a result, you will be treated as\npurchasing and owning an undivided beneficial\nownership interest in the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities, and you will be\nrequired to take into account your pro rata\nshare of all the items of income, gain, loss,\nor deduction of the Issuer Trust corresponding\nto the capital securities you own. United\nStates Holders This subsection describes the\ntax consequences to a United States holder. A\nholder of capital securities is a United\nStates holder if such holder is a beneficial\nowner of a capital security and is:\n                                              \n      a citizen or resident of the United     \n      States,                                 \n                                              \n                               \n      a domestic corporation,  \n                               \n                                              \n      an estate whose income is subject to    \n      United States federal income tax        \n      regardless of its source, or            \n                                              \n                                              \n      a trust if a United States court can    \n      exercise primary supervision over the   \n      trust\u0092s administration and one or more   \n      United States persons are authorized    \n      to control all substantial decisions    \n      of the trust.                           \n                                              \nIf you are not a United States holder, this\nsubsection does not apply to you and you\nshould refer to \u0093\u0097 Non-UnitedStates Holders\u0094\nbelow. Interest Income Subject to the\ndiscussion below under \u0093\u0097 Capital Securities\nPurchased at a Premium,\u0094 and provided we will\nnot we exercise our option to defer any\npayment of interest, you will be taxed on\ninterest on your capital securities as\nordinary income at the time you receive the\ninterest or when it accrues, depending on your\nmethod of accounting for tax purposes. If the\ncapital securities are purchased between\ninterest payment dates, and as a result a\nportion of the purchase price is attributable\nto accrued but unpaid interest, the receipt of\ninterest corresponding to the accrued but\nunpaid interest at the time of purchase will\nnot be includible in income but will instead\nreduce your tax basis in your capital\nsecurities. Additionally, the capital\nsecurities could conceivably be treated as\n\u0093contingent payment debt instruments.\u0094 In such\na case, cash-basis holders would include\ninterest in income as it accrues. Market\nDiscount You will be treated as if you\npurchased your capital securities at a market\ndiscount, and your capital security will be a\nmarket discount capital security, if the\ndifference between the liquidation value of\nthe capital securities, and the price you paid\nfor your capital securities is equal to or\ngreater than 0.25 percent of the liquidation\nvalue of the capital securities, multiplied by\nthe number of complete years to the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities\u0092\nmaturity. If the liquidation value of your\ncapital securities exceeds the price you paid\nfor the capital securities by less than 0.25\npercent multiplied by the number of complete\nyears to the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities\u0092 maturity, the excess constitutes\nde minimis market discount, and the rules\ndiscussed below are not applicable to you. You\nmust treat any gain you recognize on the\nretirement or disposition of your capital\nsecurity as ordinary income to the extent of\nthe accrued market discount on your capital\nsecurity. Alternatively, you 50\n\nmay elect to include market discount in income\ncurrently over the life of capital security.\nIf you make this election, it will apply to\nall debt instruments with market discount that\nyou acquire\non or after the first day of the first taxable\nyear to which the election applies. You may\nnot revoke this election without the consent\nof the United States Internal Revenue Service.\nIf you own a market discount capital security\nand do not make this\nelection, you will generally be required to\ndefer deductions for interest on borrowings\nallocable to your capital security in an\namount not exceeding the accrued market\ndiscount on your capital security until the\nretirement or disposition of your\ncapital security.\n\nIf you own a market discount capital security,\nthe market discount would accrue on a\nstraight-line basis unless an election is\nmade to accrue market discount using a\nconstant-yield method. If you make this\nelection, it will apply only to the debt\nsecurity with respect to which it is made and\nyou may not revoke it. You will, however, not\ninclude accrued market discount in\nincome unless you elect to do so as described\nabove.\n\nCapital Securities Purchased at a Premium\n\nIf you purchased the capital securities at a\nprice which exceeds the liquidation amount of\nthe capital securities, you may elect to treat\nsuch excess as\n\u0093amortizable bond premium.\u0094 If you make this\nelection, you will reduce the amount required\nto be included in your income each accrual\nperiod with respect to interest on the capital\nsecurity by the amount of amortizable bond\npremium\nallocable to that accrual period, based on the\ncapital security\u0092s yield to maturity. If the\namortizable bond premium allocable to an\naccrual period exceeds your interest income\nfrom the capital securities for such accrual\nperiod, such excess is\nfirst allowed as a deduction to the extent of\ninterest included in your income in respect of\nthe capital securities in previous accrual\nperiods and is then carried forward to your\nnext accrual period. If the amortizable bond\npremium allocable and\ncarried forward to the accrual period in which\nthe capital securities are sold, retired or\notherwise disposed of exceeds your interest\nincome for such accrual period, you would be\nallowed an ordinary deduction equal to such\nexcess. If you make an\nelection to amortize bond premium, such\nelection will apply to all debt instruments,\nother than debt instruments the interest on\nwhich is excludible from gross income, that\nyou hold at the beginning of the first taxable\nyear to which the election\napplies or that you thereafter acquire, and\nyou may not revoke the election without the\nconsent of the Internal Revenue Service.\nGenerally, if you purchase the capital\nsecurities at a premium and do not make this\nelection, you will not be permitted\nto reduce the interest income on the capital\nsecurities by the amount of the amortizable\nbond premium and you may have a capital loss\nat maturity of the capital securities. The\nability to deduct capital losses is subject to\nsignificant limitations.\n\nDistribution of Subordinated Debt Securities\nto Holders of Capital Securities Upon\nLiquidation of the Issuer Trust\n\nIf the Issuer Trust distributes the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities as\ndescribed above under the caption \u0093Description\nof Capital\nSecurities and Related Instruments \u0097\nLiquidation Distribution Upon Dissolution\u0094,\nyou will receive directly your proportional\nshare of the corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities previously held indirectly through\nthe trust. Under\ncurrent law, you will not be taxed on the\ndistribution and your holding period and\naggregate tax basis in your corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities will be equal to\nthe holding period and aggregate tax basis you\nhad in your capital securities\nbefore the distribution. If, however, the\ntrust were to become taxed on the income\nreceived or accrued on the subordinated debt\nsecurities due to a tax event, the trust might\nbe taxed on a distribution of corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities\nto you, and you might recognize gain or loss\nas if you had exchanged your capital\nsecurities for the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities you received upon the\nliquidation of the trust. You will include\ninterest in income in respect of\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities\nreceived from the trust in the manner\ndescribed above under \u0093\u0097 Taxation of Capital\nSecurities \u0097 Interest Income\u0094.\n\n51\n\nSale or Redemption of Capital Securities If\nyou sell your capital securities, including\nthrough a redemption for cash, you will\nrecognize gain or loss equal to the difference\nbetween your adjusted tax basis in your\ncapital securities and the amount you realize\non the sale of your capital securities (except\nto the extent any amount that you realize is\ntreated as a payment of accrued interest on\nyour proportional share of the corresponding\nsubordinated debt securities). Assuming that\nwe do not exercise our option to defer payment\nof interest on the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities, your adjusted tax basis in\nyour capital securities generally will be the\nprice you paid for your capital securities,\nadjusted by: (a) adding any market discount\npreviously included in income with respect to\nyour capital securities, and then (b)\nsubtracting any payments on your capital\nsecurities (other than qualified stated\ninterest on the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities) or amortizable bond premium\nto the extent that such premium either reduced\ninterest income on your capital securities or\ngave rise to a deduction on your capital\nsecurities. If the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities are deemed to be issued with\noriginal issue discount as a result of an\nactual deferral of interest payments, your\nadjusted tax basis in your capital securities\ngenerally will be the price you paid for your\ncapital securities, adjusted by (a) adding any\noriginal issue discount or market discount\npreviously includible in income with respect\nto your capital securities, and then (b)\nsubtracting any payments on your capital\nsecurities (other than qualified stated\ninterest on the corresponding subordinated\ndebt securities) or amortizable bond premium\napplied to reduce interest on your capital\nsecurities. This gain or loss generally will\nbe capital gain or loss, except to the extent\nattributable to market discount, as discussed\nabove. Capital gain of a non-corporateUnited\nStates holder is generally taxed at\npreferential rates where the property is held\nfor more than one year. If we exercise our\noption to defer any payment of interest on the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities,\nour capital securities may trade at a price\nthat does not accurately reflect the value of\naccrued but unpaid interest with respect to\nthe underlying corresponding subordinated debt\nsecurities. If you sell your capital\nsecurities before the record date for the\npayment of distributions, you will not receive\npayment of a distribution for the period\nbefore the sale. However, you will be required\nto include accrued but unpaid interest on the\ncorresponding subordinated debt securities\nthrough the date of the sale as ordinary\nincome for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nand to add the amount of accrued but unpaid\ninterest to your tax basis in the capital\nsecurities, as discussed above. Your increased\ntax basis in the capital securities will\nincrease the amount of any capital loss that\nyou may have otherwise realized on the sale.\nIn general, an individual taxpayer may offset\nonly $3,000 of capital losses against regular\nincome during any year. Non-UnitedStates\nHolders This subsection describes the U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences to a Non-\nUnitedStates holder. You are a Non-\nUnitedStates holder if you are the beneficial\nowner of a capital security and are, for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes:\n                                       \n      a nonresident alien individual,  \n                                       \n                                 \n      a foreign corporation, or  \n                                 \n                                              \n      an estate or trust that in either case  \n      is not subject to U.S. federal income   \n      tax on a net income basis on income or  \n      gain                                    \n      from a capital security.                \n                                              \nIf you are a United States holder, this\nsubsection does not apply to you. 52\n\nU.S. Federal Withholding Tax Under U.S.\nfederal income tax law, and subject to the\ndiscussion of backup withholding below, if you\nare a Non-UnitedStates holder of a capital\nsecurity:\n                                              \n      we and other U.S. payors generally      \n      will not be required to deduct U.S.     \n      withholding tax from payments of        \n      principal, premium,                     \n      if any, and interest, including         \n      original issue discount, to you if, in  \n      the case of payments of interest or     \n      market discount:                        \n                                              \n                                              \n      you do not actually or constructively   \n      own 10% or more of the total combined   \n  1.  voting power of all classes of our      \n      stock                                   \n      entitled to vote,                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      you are not a controlled foreign        \n  2.  corporation that is related to us       \n      through stock ownership, and            \n                                              \n               \n  3.  either:  \n               \n                                              \n      you have furnished to the U.S. payor    \n      an Internal Revenue Service Form        \n      W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E or an acceptable     \n  i.  substitute form upon which you          \n      certify, under penalties of perjury,    \n      that you are not a United States        \n      person,                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       you have furnished to the U.S. payor   \n       an Internal Revenue Service Form       \n       W-8ECI or                              \n  ii.  an acceptable substitute form upon     \n       which you certify, under penalties of  \n       perjury, that such payments are        \n       effectively connected with your trade  \n       or business in the United States,      \n                                              \n                                              \n        in the case of payments made outside  \n        the United States to you at an        \n        offshore account (generally, an       \n        account maintained by                 \n        you at a bank or other financial      \n        institution at any location outside   \n  iii.  the United States), you have          \n        furnished to the U.S. payor           \n        documentation that establishes your   \n        identity and your status as the       \n        beneficial owner of the payment for   \n        U.S. federal income                   \n        tax purposes and as a person who is   \n        not a United States person,           \n                                              \n                                              \n       the U.S. payor has received a          \n       withholding certificate (furnished on  \n  iv.  an appropriate Internal Revenue        \n       Service Form W-8 or an acceptable      \n       substitute form) from a person         \n       claiming to be:                        \n                                              \n                                              \n      a withholding foreign partnership       \n      (generally a foreign partnership that   \n      has entered into an agreement with the  \n      Internal                                \n  a.

If a tax treaty applies, you may be\neligible for a reduction of or exemption from\nU.S. federal withholding tax. To claim any\nexemption from or reduction in the 30%\nwithholding tax, you must provide a properly\nexecuted Internal Revenue Service Form\nW-8BENor W-BEN-Eor an acceptable substitute\nform claiming a reduction of or an exemption\nfrom withholding tax under an applicable tax\ntreaty.

As of the date of this prospectus,\nCapital II\u0092s\nassets consist solely of shares of Series E\nand Capital III\u0092s assets consist solely of\nshares of Series F.\n\nEach holder of APEX\nhas a beneficial interest in the relevant\nTrust but does not own any specific shares of\nthe Preferred held by that Trust. However,\nthe Trust Agreement under which each Trust\noperates defines the financial entitlements\nof its APEX in a manner that\ncauses those financial entitlements to\ncorrespond to the financial entitlements of\nthat Trust in the Preferred it holds.\nAccordingly, each APEX of Capital II\ncorresponds to 1/100th of a share of Series E\nheld by Capital II and each\nAPEX of Capital III corresponds to 1/100th of\na share of Series F held by Capital III.\n\nThe CUSIPs are 381427AA1 for\nCapital II\u0092s APEX and 38144QAA7 for Capital\nIII\u0092s APEX.\n\nWhat are the basic terms of the Preferred?\n\nEach Trust makes distributions on its APEX\nout of the dividends, if any, declared by GS\nGroup\u0092s board of directors (or a duly\nauthorized committee\nof the board) on the Preferred it holds.\n\nDividend Rate. Any dividends on the Preferred\nare calculated at a rate per annum that\nresets\nquarterly (which is determined on the second\nLondon business day prior to the reset date)\nand equals the greater of (i) three-month\nLIBOR for the related Dividend Period plus\n0.765% (in the case of Series E) or 0.77% (in\nthe case of\nSeries F) and (ii) 4.000%. Dividends are\ncalculated on the basis of a 360-day year and\nthe actual number of days in the Dividend\nPeriod elapsed.\n\nDividend Payment Dates. The Dividend Payment\nDates for the Preferred, or \u0093Dividend Payment\nDates,\u0094 are March 1,\nJune 1, September 1 and December 1 of each\nyear (or if any such day is not a business\nday, the following business day).\n\nDeclaration of Dividends. Holders of the\nPreferred are entitled to receive non-\ncumulative cash\ndividends, only when, as and if declared by\nGS Group\u0092s board of directors (or a duly\nauthorized committee of the board), payable\nat the applicable dividend rate applied to\nthe liquidation preference per share.\n\nRedemption. Series E and Series F are\nredeemable on any date (but subject to the\nlimitations described below under\n\u0093Replacement Capital Covenants\u0094) at GS\nGroup\u0092s option, in whole or in part, at a\nredemption price equal to $100,000 per share\nplus any declared and unpaid dividends,\nwithout regard to any undeclared dividends.\nThe Preferred is not\nsubject to any sinking fund or other\nobligation of GS Group to redeem, repurchase\nor retire the Preferred.

Distributions are made\nonly to the extent of GS Group\u0092s assets that\nare available after satisfaction of all\nliabilities to creditors, if any (pro rata as\nto the Preferred and any other shares of our\nstock ranking equally as to such\ndistribution). Voting Rights. Holders of the\nPreferred have no voting rights, except as\ndescribed under \u0093Description of the Preferred\n\u0097 Voting Rights\u0094 on page 32. Holders of APEX\nmust act through the Property Trustee to\nexercise any voting rights. Maturity. The\nPreferred do not have any maturity date, and\nGS Group is not required to redeem the\nPreferred. Accordingly, the Preferred will\nremain outstanding indefinitely, unless and\nuntil GS Group decides to redeem it. There\nare regulatory and other restrictions on the\nright of GS Group to redeem the Preferred.\nSee \u0093Risk Factors \u0097 Holders Should Not Expect\nGS Group to Redeem the Preferred on Any\nParticular Date\u0094 below.\n\n4\n\nPreemptive Rights. Holders of the Preferred\nhave no preemptive rights.\n\nWhat distributions or payments are made to\nholders of the APEX?\n\nEach Trust makes distributions on its APEX\nonly when and to the extent it has funds on\nhand available to make such distributions\nfrom receipt of\ndividends on the Preferred it holds.\nSimilarly, if we exercise our right to pay\npartial dividends or skip dividends on the\ncorresponding Preferred, the applicable Trust\nwill pay partial or skip corresponding\ndistributions on its APEX.\n\nThe distribution dates for APEX, which we\ncall \u0093Distribution Dates,\u0094 are each March 1,\nJune 1, September 1 and December 1\n(or, if any such day is not a business day,\nthe next business day). A \u0093Distribution\nPeriod\u0094 is each period of time beginning on a\nDistribution Date and continuing to but not\nincluding the next succeeding Distribution\nDate for such series.\nDistributions are calculated on the basis of\na 360-day year and the number of days\nactually elapsed in the Distribution Period.\n\nDistributions on APEX are payable on a non-\ncumulative basis on each Distribution Date at\na rate per annum equal\nto the greater of (i) three-month LIBOR for\nsuch Distribution Period plus0.765% (in the\ncase of Capital II\u0092s APEX) or 0.77% (in the\ncase of Capital III\u0092s APEX) and (ii) 4.000%.\n\nWhen can a Trust not make distributions on\nits APEX?\n\nEach Trust makes distributions on its APEX\nonly to the extent it has received payments\non the Preferred it holds. Accordingly, each\nTrust will not make\ndistributions on its APEX whenever we do not\nmake dividend payments on the Preferred it\nholds.\n\nIn the event dividends are not declared by GS\nGroup\u0092s board of directors (or a duly\nauthorized committee of the board) on the\nPreferred for payment on any Dividend Payment\nDate, then such dividends shall not be\ncumulative and shall cease to accrue and be\npayable. If our board of directors\n(or a duly authorized committee of the board)\nhas not declared a dividend before the\nDividend Payment Date for any Dividend\nPeriod, we will have no obligation to pay\ndividends accrued on the Preferred for such\nDividend Period after the Dividend\nPayment Date for that Dividend Period,\nwhether or not dividends on the Preferred are\ndeclared for any future Dividend Period. So\nlong as any Preferred remains outstanding, no\ndividend shall be paid or declared on our\ncommon stock or any of our other\nstock ranking junior to the Preferred (other\nthan a dividend payable solely in common\nstock or in other stock ranking junior to the\nPreferred), and no common stock or other\nstock ranking junior to the Preferred shall\nbe purchased, redeemed or\notherwise acquired for consideration by us,\ndirectly or indirectly (other than as a\nresult of a reclassification of such junior\nstock for or into other junior stock, or the\nexchange or conversion of one share of junior\nstock for or into another\nshare of such junior stock), during a\nDividend Period, unless the full dividends\nfor the latest completed Dividend Period on\nall outstanding shares of the Preferred have\nbeen declared and paid, or declared and a sum\nsufficient for the payment\nthereof has been set aside. However, the\nforegoing provision shall not restrict the\nability of GS&Co., or any of our other\naffiliates, to engage in any market-making\ntransactions in our junior stock in the\nordinary course of business.\n\nWhen dividends are not paid in full upon the\nPreferred and any shares of other classes or\nseries of our securities that rank equally\nwith the Preferred\n(in the payment of dividends or in the\ndistribution of assets on any liquidation,\ndissolution or winding up of GS Group) for a\nDividend Period, all dividends declared with\nrespect to the Preferred and all such equally\nranking securities for such\nDividend Period shall be declared pro rata so\nthat the respective amounts of such dividends\nshall bear the same ratio to each other as\nall accrued but unpaid dividends per share on\nthe Preferred for such Dividend Period and\nall such equally ranking\nsecurities for such Dividend Period bear to\neach other.\n\n5\n\nSubject to the foregoing, such dividends\n(payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may\nbe determined by\nGS Group\u0092s board of directors (or a duly\nauthorized committee of the board) may be\ndeclared and paid on our common stock and any\nother stock ranking equally with or junior to\nthe Preferred from time to time out of any\nfunds legally available\nfor such payment, and the Preferred shall not\nbe entitled to participate in any such\ndividend.\n\nWhat is the maturity of the APEX, and may a\nTrust redeem its APEX?\n\nThe APEX have no stated maturity. A Trust\nmust redeem its APEX upon redemption of the\nPreferred it holds. The redemption price of\neach\nAPEX will equal the redemption price of the\ncorresponding assets. The redemption price of\nthe Preferred is described under \u0093What are\nthe basic terms of the Preferred? \u0097\nRedemption\u0094 above. The Property Trustee will\ngive not less than\n30 days\u0092 nor more than 60 days\u0092 notice of\nredemption by mail to holders of the APEX.\n\nAre there limitations on our or a Trust\u0092s\nright to redeem or repurchase the APEX?\n\nWe have entered into Replacement Capital\nCovenants, or \u0093Replacement Capital\nCovenants,\u0094 relating to the\nAPEX and the Preferred that each Trust\npurchased. The Replacement Capital Covenants\nonly benefit holders of Covered Debt, as\ndefined in \u0093Replacement Capital Covenants\u0094\nbelow, and are not enforceable by holders of\nAPEX or the Preferred.\nHowever, the Replacement Capital Covenants\ncould preclude us from repurchasing APEX or\nthe Preferred at a time we might otherwise\nwish to repurchase APEX or redeem or\nrepurchase shares of the Preferred. If notice\nof redemption of any Preferred has\nbeen given and if the funds necessary for the\nredemption have been set aside by us for the\nbenefit of the holders of any shares of the\nPreferred so called for redemption, then,\nfrom and after the redemption date, those\nshares shall no longer be\ndeemed outstanding and all rights of the\nholders of those shares (including the right\nto receive any dividends) will terminate,\nexcept the right to receive the redemption\nprice.\n\nIn the Replacement Capital Covenants, we\ncovenant not to redeem or purchase APEX or\nthe Preferred prior to June 1, 2022 (in the\ncase of\nCapital II) or September 4, 2022 (in the case\nof Capital III), except in either case to the\nextent that the applicable redemption or\npurchase price does not exceed: (i) 133.33%\nof the aggregate amount of (A) net cash\nproceeds we or our subsidiaries have received\nfrom the issuance and sale of common stock of\nGS Group and rights to acquire common stock\nof GS Group and (B) the market value of\ncommon stock of GS Group that we or our\nsubsidiaries have delivered\nor issued as consideration for property or\nassets in an arm\u0092s length transaction or in\nconnection with the conversion of any\nconvertible or exchangeable securities, other\nthan securities for which we have received\nequity credit from a\nnationally recognized rating agency, plus\n(ii) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds\nwe or our subsidiaries have received from the\nissuance of certain other specified\nsecurities that have equity-like\ncharacteristics that satisfy the\nrequirements of the Replacement Capital\nCovenant, in each case, since October 17,\n2012 (without counting any proceeds received\nmore than once for purposes of these\nlimitations).\n\nAdditionally, any redemption or repurchase of\nthe APEX is subject to prior approval of the\nFederal Reserve. See \u0093What are the basic\nterms of the\nPreferred? \u0097 Redemption\u0094 above concerning\nlimitations on our right to redeem or\nrepurchase shares of the Preferred.\n\nEach Trust is\nrequired to redeem its APEX upon redemption\nof the Preferred it holds out of the\nredemption proceeds.\n\n6\n\nWhen can a Trust be dissolved? A Trust may\nonly be dissolved upon a bankruptcy,\ndissolution or liquidation of GS Group, the\nredemption of all of its APEX in accordance\nwith the provisions of its Trust Agreement or\nthe entry of an order for the dissolution of\nthe Trust by a court of competent\njurisdiction. Upon the dissolution, after\nsatisfaction of liabilities of creditors of a\nTrust, holders of its APEX will generally\nreceive the either the Preferred the Trust\nheld or depositary receipts in respect of\ntheir beneficial interests in the Preferred,\nand its APEX will no longer be deemed to be\noutstanding. What is the extent of our\nGuarantees? Pursuant to a guarantee, or\n\u0093Guarantee,\u0094 that we have executed and\ndelivered for the benefit of holders of the\nAPEX of each Trust, we irrevocably guarantee,\non a junior subordinated basis, the payment\nin full of the following:\n                                              \n      any unpaid distributions required to    \n      be paid on such APEX, to the extent     \n      dividends have been declared on the     \n      Preferred held                          \n      by such Trust and such Trust has funds  \n      available to make the payment;          \n                                              \n                                              \n      the redemption price for any APEX       \n      called for redemption, to the extent    \n      such Trust has funds available to make  \n      the payment;                            \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      upon a voluntary or involuntary         \n      dissolution, winding up or liquidation  \n      of such Trust, other than in            \n      connection with a                       \n      distribution of the Preferred it holds  \n      to the holders of its APEX, the lesser  \n      of:                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      the aggregate of the liquidation        \n      amount and all unpaid distributions on  \n      the APEX to the date of payment, to     \n      the extent such                         \n      Trust has funds available to make the   \n      payment; and                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      the amount of assets of such Trust      \n      remaining available for distribution    \n      to holders of its APEX upon             \n      liquidation of such                     \n      Trust.                                  \n                                              \nOur obligations under each Guarantee are\nunsecured, are subordinated to and junior in\nright of payment to all of our secured and\nsenior and subordinated debt and rank on a\nparity with any other similar guarantees we\nmay issue in the future. The APEX and the\nGuarantees do not limit our ability or the\nability of our subsidiaries to incur\nadditional indebtedness, including\nindebtedness that ranks senior to or equally\nwith the Guarantees. The Guarantees, when\ntaken together with our obligations under the\nTrust Agreements, including the obligations\nto pay costs, expenses, debts and liabilities\nof the Trusts, other than liabilities with\nrespect to the Trusts\u0092 securities, have the\neffect of providing a full and unconditional\nguarantee by GS Group to pay amounts due on\nthe APEX. What are the U.S. federal income\ntax consequences related to the APEX? If you\npurchase APEX in a market-making transaction\nafter the date of this prospectus, we will\ntreat you for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes as having acquired an interest in\nthe Preferred held by the applicable Trust.\nAssuming full compliance with the terms of\nits Trust Agreement, a Trust will not be\nclassified as an association or publicly\ntraded partnership taxable as a corporation\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes, and\neach Trust intends to treat itself as one or\nmore grantor trusts or agency arrangements\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAccordingly, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, we will treat each holder of the\nAPEX of a Trust as purchasing and owning a\nbeneficial interest in the Preferred. held by\nsuch Trust.\n\n7\n\nWhat are our expected uses of proceeds from\ntransactions in the APEX? Neither we nor the\nTrusts will receive any proceeds from market-\nmaking transactions in the APEX or the\nPreferred. Where can I find additional\ninformation?

No separate financial statements of\nthe Trusts are included in this prospectus.\nGS Group and the Trusts do not consider that\nsuch financial statements would be material\nto holders of the APEX because each Trust is\na special purpose entity, has no independent\noperations and is not engaged in\n\n8\n\nand does not propose to engage in any\nactivity other than holding as trust assets\nthe corresponding Preferred and issuing its\nAPEX and Common Securities. Furthermore,\ntaken together, GS\nGroup\u0092s obligations under the related trust\nagreement, expense agreement and guarantee\nprovide, in the aggregate, a full,\nirrevocable and unconditional guarantee of\npayments of distributions and other amounts\ndue on the APEX.

In addition, the Trusts do not file\nreports under the Exchange Act with the\nSEC.\n\n9\n\nRISK FACTORS An investment in APEX is subject\nto the risks described below. You should\ncarefully review the following risk factors\nand other information contained in this\nprospectus before deciding whether this\ninvestment is suited to your particular\ncircumstances. In addition, because each APEX\nrepresents a beneficial interest in the\napplicable Trust, you are also making an\ninvestment decision with regard to the\nPreferred, as well as our Guarantee of the\nTrust\u0092s obligations. You should carefully\nreview all the information in this prospectus\nabout all of these securities. We Guarantee\nDistributions on the APEX Only If the Trust\nHas Cash Available If you hold any APEX, we\nwill guarantee you, on an unsecured and\njunior subordinated basis, the payment of the\nfollowing:\n                                              \n      any accumulated and unpaid              \n      distributions required to be paid on    \n      the APEX, to the extent the Trust has   \n      funds available to                      \n      make the payment;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      the redemption price for any APEX       \n      called for redemption, to the extent    \n      the Trust has funds available to make   \n      the payment;                            \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      upon a voluntary or involuntary         \n      dissolution, winding up or liquidation  \n      of the Trust, other than in connection  \n      with a                                  \n      distribution of corresponding assets    \n      to holders of APEX, the lesser of:      \n                                              \n                                              \n      the aggregate of the stated             \n      liquidation amount and all declared     \n      and unpaid distributions on the APEX    \n      to the date of                          \n      payment, to the extent the Trust has    \n      funds available to make the payment;    \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      the amount of assets of the Trust       \n      remaining available for distribution    \n      to holders of the APEX upon             \n      liquidation of the                      \n      Trust.                                  \n                                              \nIf we do not declare dividends on the\nPreferred held by a Trust, the Trust will not\nhave sufficient funds to make the related\ndistribution on its APEX. The Guarantee does\nnot cover payments on the APEX when the Trust\ndoes not have sufficient funds to make them.\nOur obligations under the Guarantee are\nunsecured and are subordinated to and junior\nin right of payment to all of our secured and\nsenior indebtedness, and rank on a parity with\nany similar guarantees issued by us in the\nfuture. The Secondary Market for the APEX May\nBe Illiquid Although the APEX are listed on\nthe New York Stock Exchange under the symbols\n\u0093GS/43PE\u0094 and \u0093GS/43PF\u0094, we can give you no\nassurance as to the liquidity of any market\nfor the APEX or that any such liquidity that\nmay exist will continue. As APEX may only be\nheld or transferred in amounts having an\naggregate liquidation amount of at least\n$1,000, the trading market for APEX may be\nless active than markets for securities that\nmay be held or transferred in smaller\ndenominations and may be less liquid. In\nPurchasing APEX, You Are Making an Investment\nDecision with Regard to the Preferred The APEX\nrepresent beneficial interests in the\napplicable Trust corresponding to 1/100th of a\nshare of the Preferred it holds for each\n$1,000 liquidation amount of APEX. Each Trust\nrelies solely on the payments it receives on\nthe Preferred it holds to fund all payments on\nits APEX. Accordingly, you should carefully\nreview the information in this prospectus\nregarding the Preferred. 10\n\nThe Preferred is Equity and is Subordinate to\nOur Existing and Future Indebtedness\n\nShares of the Preferred are equity interests\nin GS Group and do not constitute\nindebtedness. As such, shares of the Preferred\nrank junior to all\nindebtedness and other non-equity claims on GS\nGroup with respect to assets available to\nsatisfy claims on GS Group, including in a\nliquidation of GS Group. Additionally, unlike\nindebtedness, where principal\nand interest would customarily be payable on\nspecified due dates, in the case of preferred\nstock like the Preferred, (1) dividends are\npayable only if declared by our board of\ndirectors (or a duly authorized committee of\nthe board), (2) as\na corporation, we are subject to restrictions\non payments of dividends and redemption price\nout of lawfully available funds, and (3) as a\nbank holding company, our ability to declare\nand pay dividends is subject to the oversight\nof the Federal\nReserve Board. If we defer interest on any\noutstanding debt securities, we would not be\npermitted to pay dividends on any of our\ncapital stock, including the Preferred, during\nthe deferral period.\n\nHolders Should Not Expect GS Group to Redeem\nthe Preferred on Any Particular Date\n\nThe Preferred is a perpetual equity security.\nThe Preferred has no maturity or mandatory\nredemption date and is not redeemable at the\noption of\ninvestors. By its terms, the Preferred may be\nredeemed by us at our option, either in whole\nor in part, at any time. Any decision we may\nmake at any time to propose a redemption of\nthe Preferred will depend, among other things,\nupon our evaluation\nof the overall level and quality of our\ncapital components, considered in light of our\nrisk exposures, earnings and growth strategy,\nas well as general market conditions at such\ntime. Our right to redeem the Preferred is\nsubject to two important\nlimitations as described below. Accordingly,\ninvestors should not expect us to redeem the\nPreferred on any particular date.\n\nWe may not redeem\nshares of the Preferred without having\nreceived the prior approval of the Federal\nReserve Board under the current capital\nguidelines applicable to us. We cannot assure\nyou that the Federal Reserve Board will\napprove any redemption of the Preferred\nthat we may propose. We understand that the\nfactors the Federal Reserve Board will\nconsider in evaluating a proposed redemption\nby a bank holding company include, among other\nthings, the capital plans and stress tests\nsubmitted by the bank holding\ncompany, the bank holding company\u0092s ability to\nmeet and exceed minimum regulatory capital\nratios under stressed scenarios, its expected\nsources and uses of capital over the planning\nhorizon (generally a period of two years)\nunder baseline and\nstressed scenarios, and any potential impact\nof changes to its business plan and activities\non its capital adequacy and liquidity,\nalthough the Federal Reserve Board may change\nthese factors at any time.\n\nSecond, in connection with the initial\nissuance of the APEX, we entered into\nReplacement Capital Covenants that limit our\nright to repurchase the APEX\nand to redeem or repurchase the Preferred. In\nthe Replacement Capital Covenant, we covenant\nto redeem or repurchase the APEX prior to June\n1, 2022 (in the case of Capital II\u0092s APEX and\nthe Series E) or September 4, 2022 (in\nthe case of Capital III\u0092s APEX and the Series\nF) only if and to the extent that the total\nrepurchase price is equal to or less than\ndesignated percentages of the net cash\nproceeds that we or our subsidiaries have\nreceived since\nOctober 17, 2012 from the issuance of our\ncommon stock, certain qualifying perpetual\nnon-cumulative preferred stock satisfying the\nrequirements of the Replacement Capital\nCovenants or certain other\nsecurities that qualify under current\nregulatory conditions.\n\nOur ability to raise proceeds from qualifying\nsecurities will depend on, among other\nthings, market conditions as well as the\nacceptability to prospective investors of the\nterms of such qualifying securities.\nAccordingly, there could be circumstances\nwhere we would wish to redeem or repurchase\nsome or all of the APEX or the\nPreferred and sufficient cash is available for\nthat purpose, but we are restricted from doing\nso because we have not been able to obtain\nproceeds from qualifying securities sufficient\nfor that purpose.\n\n11\n\nThe Trusts May Not Receive Dividends on the\nPreferred\n\nDividends on the Preferred are discretionary\nand non-cumulative. Consequently, if our board\nof directors (or a\nduly authorized committee of the board) does\nnot authorize and declare a dividend for any\ndividend period, holders of the Preferred will\nnot be entitled to receive any such dividend,\nand such unpaid dividend will cease to accrue\nand be payable. We\nwill have no obligation to pay dividends\naccrued for a dividend period after the\ndividend payment date for such period if our\nboard of directors (or a duly authorized\ncommittee of the board) has not declared such\ndividend before the related dividend\npayment date, whether or not dividends are\ndeclared for any subsequent dividend period\nwith respect to the Authorized Preferred or\nany other preferred stock we may issue.\n\nIn addition, if we fail to comply, or if and\nto the extent such act would cause us to fail\nto comply, with applicable laws, rules and\nregulations\n(including applicable capital adequacy\nguidelines), we may not declare, pay or set\naside for payment dividends on the Preferred.\nAs a result, if payment of dividends on the\nPreferred for any Dividend Period would cause\nus to fail to comply with any\napplicable law, rule or regulation, we will\nnot declare or pay a dividend for such\ndividend period. In such a case, holders of\nthe APEX will not be entitled to receive any\ndistribution for that Distribution Period, and\nthe unpaid dividend will cease\nto accrue and be payable.\n\nIf we are not paying full dividends on any\noutstanding parity stock, we will not be able\nto pay full dividends on the\nPreferred. When dividends are not paid in full\non the Preferred and any shares of parity\nstock for a dividend period, all dividends\ndeclared with respect to shares of the\nPreferred and all parity stock for such\ndividend period shall be declared pro\nrata so that the respective amounts of such\ndividends bear the same ratio to each other as\nall accrued but unpaid dividends per share on\nthe shares of the Preferred for such dividend\nperiod and all parity stock for such dividend\nperiod bear to each\nother. Therefore, if we are not paying full\ndividends on any outstanding parity stock, we\nwill not be able to pay full dividends on the\nPreferred.\n\nInvestors Do Not Control the Administration of\nthe Trusts and Have Limited Voting Rights\n\nWe hold all the Common Securities of each\nTrust. These securities give us the right to\ncontrol nearly all aspects of the\nadministration, operation or\nmanagement of the Trusts, including selection\nand removal of the administrative trustees.\nThe APEX, on the other hand, generally have no\nvoting rights. You will be able to vote only\non matters relating to the modification of the\nterms of your APEX.\nFor further information, see \u0093Description of\nthe APEX \u0097 Voting Rights; Amendment of Each\nTrust Agreement\u0094 below.\n\nWe Are a Holding Company and Are Dependent on\nOur Subsidiaries to Meet Our\n\nObligations and Provide Funds for Payment of\nDividends to Our Stockholders\n\nWe are a holding company and, therefore,\ndepend on dividends, distributions and other\npayments from our subsidiaries to fund\ndividend payments and\npayments on our obligations. Many of our\nsubsidiaries, including our broker-dealer,\nbank and insurance subsidiaries, are subject\nto laws that restrict dividend payments or\nauthorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce\nthe flow of funds from those\nsubsidiaries to us. Restrictions or regulatory\naction of that kind could impede access to\nfunds that we need to fund dividend payments\nand payments on our obligations. Because some\nof our subsidiaries, including from time to\ntime some of our\nprincipal operating subsidiaries, are\npartnerships in which we are a general partner\nor the sole limited partner, we may be liable\nfor their obligations. We also guarantee many\nof the obligations of our subsidiaries. Any\nliability we may have for\nour subsidiaries\u0092 obligations could reduce our\nassets that are available to satisfy our\ndirect creditors or fund dividend payments.\nSee \u0093Business \u0097 Regulation\u0094 in Part I, Item 1\nof our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our most\nrecent fiscal year for a further discussion of\nregulatory restrictions.\n\n12\n\nU.K. Regulators Will No Longer Persuade or\nCompel Banks to Submit Rates for Calculation\nof LIBOR After 2021; Interest Rate Benchmark\nMay Be Discontinued On July 27, 2017, the\nChief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct\nAuthority (\u0093FCA\u0094), which regulates LIBOR,\nannounced that the FCA will no longer persuade\nor compel banks to submit rates for the\ncalculation of LIBOR after 2021. On November\n30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration\nLimited (\u0093IBA\u0094), which is supervised by the UK\nFinancial Conduct Authority, announced a\nproposal to extend the publication of the most\ncommonly used USD LIBOR settings until June\n30, 2023. The Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency have strongly\nencouraged banks to cease entering into new\ncontracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference\nrate as soon as practicable and in any event\nby December 31, 2021. It is not possible to\npredict the effect of this announcement or any\nsuch discontinuance, any changes in the\nmethods pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are\ndetermined and any other reforms to LIBOR that\nwill be enacted in the U.K. and elsewhere,\nwhich may adversely affect the trading market\nfor LIBOR-based securities and the value of\nyour APEX or the Preferred, as applicable.\nGeneral Market Conditions and Unpredictable\nFactors Could Adversely Affect Market Prices\nfor the APEX There can be no assurance about\nthe market prices for the APEX. Several\nfactors, many of which are beyond our control,\ninfluence the market value of the APEX.\nFactors that might influence the market value\nof the APEX include:\n                                              \n      whether dividends have been declared    \n      and are likely to be declared on the    \n      Preferred from time to time;            \n                                              \n                                              \n      our operating performance, financial    \n      condition and prospects, or the         \n      operating performance, financial        \n      condition and                           \n      prospects of our competitors;           \n                                              \n                             \n      our creditworthiness;  \n                             \n                                              \n      the ratings given to our securities by  \n      credit rating agencies, including any   \n      ratings given to the Preferred;         \n                                              \n                                  \n      changes in interest rates;  \n                                  \n                                              \n      the market for similar securities; and  \n                                              \n                                              \n      economic, financial, geopolitical,      \n      regulatory or judicial events that      \n      affect us or the financial markets      \n      generally.                              \n                                              \nAccordingly, any APEX that an investor\npurchases in the secondary market may trade at\na discount to the price that the investor\npaid. Holders of the Preferred Have Limited\nVoting Rights Holders of the Preferred have no\nvoting rights with respect to matters that\ngenerally require the approval of voting\nshareholders. However, holders of the\nPreferred have the right to vote as a class on\ncertain fundamental matters that may affect\nthe preference or special rights of the\nPreferred, as described under \u0093Description of\nthe Preferred \u0097 Voting Rights\u0094 below. In\naddition, if dividends on the Preferred have\nnot been declared or paid for dividend periods\nequal to at least 18 months, whether or not\nfor consecutive dividend periods, holders of\nthe outstanding shares of the Preferred,\ntogether with 13\n\nholders of any other series of our preferred\nstock ranking equal with the Preferred with\nsimilar voting rights, are entitled to vote\nfor the election of two additional directors,\nsubject to the\nterms and to the limited extent described\nunder \u0093Description of the Preferred \u0097 Voting\nRights\u0094 below. Holders of APEX must act\nthrough the trustee to exercise any voting\nrights in respect of the Preferred. The\nPreferred places no\nrestrictions on our business or operations or\non our ability to incur indebtedness or engage\nin any transactions, subject only to the\nlimited voting rights referred to above.\n\n14\n\nTHE TRUSTS Please note that in this section\nentitled \u0093The Trusts,\u0094 references to The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., \u0093we,\u0094 \u0093our\u0094 and\n\u0093us\u0094 refer only to The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. and not to its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThis summary, together with the summary of\nsome of the provisions of the related\ndocuments described below, contains a\ndescription of the material terms of the\nTrusts but is not necessarily complete. We\nrefer you to the documents referred to in the\nfollowing description, copies of which are\navailable upon request from us as described\nunder \u0093Summary \u0097 Where can I find additional\ninformation?\u0094 above. Each Trust is a statutory\ntrust organized under Delaware law pursuant to\na Trust Agreement, signed by us, as sponsor of\nthe Trust, the Delaware Trustee, the Property\nTrustee and the administrative trustees and\nthe filing of a certificate of trust with the\nDelaware Secretary of State. We refer to each\nTrust Agreement, as so amended and restated,\nas a \u0093Trust Agreement.\u0094 Each Trust Agreement\nis qualified as an indenture under the Trust\nIndenture Act of 1939, as amended, or \u0093Trust\nIndenture Act.\u0094 The Trusts are used solely for\nthe following purposes:\n                                              \n      issuing the APEX and the Common         \n      Securities;                             \n                                              \n                                            \n      holding shares of the Preferred; and  \n                                            \n                                              \n      engaging in other activities that are   \n      directly related to the activities      \n      described above.                        \n                                              \nWe own all of the Common Securities, either\ndirectly or indirectly. The Common Securities\nrank equally with the APEX and the Trusts make\npayment on their Trust securities pro rata,\nexcept that if we pay less than the full\ndividend on or redemption price of the\nPreferred on any Distribution Date or\nRedemption Date, the rights of the holders of\nthe Common Securities to payment in respect of\ndistributions and payments upon liquidation,\nredemption and otherwise are subordinated to\nthe rights of the holders of the APEX. We hold\nCommon Securities of each Trust in an\naggregate liquidation amount equal to $10,000.\nThe Trust\u0092s business and affairs are conducted\nby its trustees, each appointed by us as\nsponsor of the Trust. The trustees are The\nBank of New York Mellon, as the property\ntrustee, or \u0093Property Trustee,\u0094 and BNY Mellon\nTrust of Delaware, as the Delaware trustee, or\n\u0093Delaware Trustee,\u0094 and two or more individual\ntrustees, or \u0093administrative trustees,\u0094 who\nare employees or officers of or affiliated\nwith us. The Property Trustee act as sole\ntrustee under each Trust Agreement for\npurposes of compliance with the Trust\nIndenture Act and also acts as trustee under\nthe Guarantee. See \u0093Description of the\nGuarantee\u0094 below. The Property Trustee and/or\nthe Delaware Trustee may be removed or\nreplaced for cause by the holders of a\nmajority in liquidation amount of the APEX. In\naddition, the holders of a majority in\nliquidation amount of the APEX are entitled to\nappoint, remove or replace the Property\nTrustee and/or the Delaware Trustee if we have\nfailed to declare and pay dividends on the\nPreferred held by the Trust for six or more\nconsecutive quarters. The right to vote to\nappoint, remove or replace the administrative\ntrustees is vested exclusively in the holders\nof the Common Securities, and in no event will\nthe holders of the APEX have such right. 15\n\nEach Trust is a 100%-owned finance subsidiary\nof The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and\ntherefore, pursuant\nto Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X under the\nSecurities Act of 1933 and Rule 12h-5 under\nthe Exchange Act, no separate financial\nstatements of the Trusts are included in this\nprospectus, and the Trusts do not file reports\nwith the SEC under the Exchange Act.\n\nEach Trust is\nperpetual, but may be dissolved earlier as\nprovided in its Trust Agreement.\n\nWe pay all fees and expenses related to the\nTrusts.\n\n16\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE APEX\n\nThe following is a brief description of the\nterms of the APEX and of the Trust Agreements\nunder which they are issued. It does not\npurport to be complete in all respects. This\ndescription is subject to and qualified in its\nentirety by reference to the Trust Agreements,\ncopies of which are available upon request\nfrom us as described under \u0093Summary \u0097 Where\ncan I find additional information?\u0094 above.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe APEX are securities of each Trust and are\nissued pursuant to the applicable trust\nagreement among The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.,\nThe Bank of New York\nMellon, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, the\nadministrative trustees and the several\nholders of the relevant Trust securities\n(each, a \u0093Trust Agreement\u0094). The Property\nTrustee, The Bank of New York Mellon, acts as\nindenture trustee for the\nAPEX under the Trust Agreement for purposes of\ncompliance with the provisions of the Trust\nIndenture Act. Each APEX has a liquidation\namount of $1,000.\n\nThe terms of the APEX of each Trust include\nthose stated in the Trust Agreement for such\nTrust, including any amendments thereto and\nthose made part of\nthe Trust Agreement by the Trust Indenture Act\nand the Delaware Statutory Trust Act.\n\nIn addition to the APEX, each Trust Agreement\nauthorizes the\nadministrative trustees of the Trust to issue\nthe Common Securities on behalf of the Trust.\nWe own, directly or indirectly, all of the\nCommon Securities. The Common Securities rank\non a parity, and payments upon redemption,\nliquidation or otherwise\nare made on a proportionate basis, with the\nAPEX except as set forth below under \u0093\u0097\nRanking of Common Securities.\u0094 The Trust\nAgreements do not permit the Trust to issue\nany securities other than the Common\nSecurities and the APEX or\nto incur any indebtedness.\n\nUnder the Trust Agreement, the Property\nTrustee on behalf of the relevant Trust holds\nthe Preferred for the benefit of\nthe holders of its APEX and Common Securities.\n\nThe payment of distributions out of money held\nby a Trust, and payments upon redemption of\nthe APEX\nor liquidation of the Trust, are guaranteed by\nus to the extent described under \u0093Description\nof the Guarantee.\u0094 Each Guarantee, when taken\ntogether with our obligations under the\napplicable Trust Agreement, including our\nobligations to pay\ncosts, expenses, debts and liabilities of the\nTrust, other than with respect to its Common\nSecurities and APEX, has the effect of\nproviding a full and unconditional guarantee\nof amounts due on the APEX. The Bank of New\nYork Mellon, as the Guarantee\nTrustee, holds the Guarantee for the benefit\nof the holders of the APEX. The Guarantees do\nnot cover payment of distributions when the\nTrusts do not have sufficient available funds\nto pay those distributions.\n\nWhen we use the term \u0093holder\u0094 in this\nprospectus with respect to a registered APEX,\nwe mean the person in whose name such APEX is\nregistered\nin the security register. The APEX are held in\nbook-entry form only, as described under\n\u0093Book-Entry System\u0094 below except in the\ncircumstances described in that section, and\nare held in the name of DTC or its nominee.\n\nCapital II\u0092s APEX are listed on the New York\nStock Exchange under the symbol \u0093GS/43PE\u0094 and\nCapital III\u0092s APEX are listed\non the New York Stock Exchange under the\nsymbol \u0093GS/43PF\u0094.\n\nYour financial entitlements as a holder of\nAPEX generally correspond to the\napplicable Trust\u0092s financial entitlements as a\nholder of the Preferred. The corresponding\nasset for each APEX is a 1/100th, or $1,000,\ninterest in one share of Preferred held by the\nTrust. Each Trust will pass through to you\namounts that it\nreceives on the corresponding assets for the\nAPEX as distributions on, or the liquidation\npreference of, APEX.\n\n17\n\nHolders of a Trust\u0092s APEX are be entitled to\nreceive distributions corresponding to non-\ncumulativedividends on the Preferred held by\nthe Trust. These cash dividends are payable\nif, as and when declared by our board of\ndirectors, on the Dividend Payment Dates,\nwhich are: quarterly in arrears on each March\n1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 (or if\nsuch day is not a business day, the next\nbusiness day). Assuming that we do not elect\nto pay partial dividends or to skip dividends\non the Preferred, holders of APEX will receive\ndistributions on the $1,000 liquidation amount\nper APEX at a rate per annum equal to the\ngreater of (x) three-month LIBOR for the\nrelated distribution period plus 0.765% (in\nthe case of Capital II\u0092s APEX) or 0.77% (in\nthe case of Capital III\u0092s APEX) and (y)\n4.000%, payable quarterly on each March 1,\nJune 1, September 1 and December 1 (or if any\nsuch date is not a business day, on the next\nbusiness day). Dividends are calculated on the\nbasis of a 360-dayyear and the number of days\nactually elapsed in the dividend period.\nDistributions on the APEX and dividends on the\nPreferred are non-cumulative. The Bank of New\nYork Mellon acts as registrar and transfer\nagent, or \u0093Transfer Agent,\u0094 for the APEX. If\nThe Bank of New York Mellon should resign or\nbe removed, we or the Trust will designate a\nsuccessor and the term \u0093Transfer Agent\u0094 as\nused in this prospectus will refer to that\nsuccessor. A \u0093business day\u0094 as used in this\nsection means any day other than a Saturday,\nSunday or any other day on which banking\ninstitutions and trust companies in New York,\nNew York or Wilmington, Delaware are permitted\nor required by any applicable law to close.\nEach Trust must make distributions on its APEX\non each Distribution Date to the extent that\nit has funds available therefor. A Trust\u0092s\nfunds available for distribution to you as a\nholder of its APEX will be limited to payments\nreceived from us on the Preferred held by the\nTrust. We guarantee the payment of\ndistributions on the APEX out of moneys held\nby each Trust to the extent of available Trust\nfunds, as described under \u0093Description of the\nGuarantee\u0094 below. Distributions on the APEX\nare payable to holders as they appear in the\nsecurity register of the Trust on the relevant\nrecord dates. The record dates are the\nfifteenth calendar day immediately preceding\nthe next succeeding Distribution Date.\nDistributions are paid through the Property\nTrustee or paying agent, who hold amounts\nreceived in respect of the Preferred for the\nbenefit of the holders of the APEX. Subject to\nany applicable laws and regulations and the\nprovisions of the Trust Agreement, each\ndistribution will be made as described in the\nsection entitled \u0093Book-Entry System\u0094 below.\nFor more information about dividends on the\nPreferred, see \u0093Description of the Preferred \u0097\nDividends\u0094 below. Agreed Tax Treatment of the\nAPEX As a beneficial owner of APEX, by\nacceptance of the beneficial interest therein,\nyou will be deemed to have agreed, for all\nU.S. federal income tax purposes:\n                                              \n      to treat yourself as the owner of a     \n      1/100th interest in a share of the      \n      relevant Preferred; and                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      to treat the Trust as one or more       \n      grantor trusts or agency arrangements.  \n                                              \nMandatory Redemption of APEX upon Redemption\nof the Preferred The APEX have no stated\nmaturity but must be redeemed on the date we\nredeem the Preferred, and the Property Trustee\nor paying agent will apply the proceeds from\nsuch repayment or redemption to redeem a like\namount, as defined below, of the APEX. The\nPreferred is perpetual but we may 18\n\nredeem it on any Dividend Payment Date,\nsubject to certain limitations. See\n\u0093Description of the Preferred \u0097 Redemption\u0094\nand \u0093Replacement Capital Covenants\u0094 below. The\nredemption price per APEX will equal the\nredemption price of the Preferred. See\n\u0093Description of the Preferred \u0097 Redemption\u0094\nbelow. If notice of redemption of any\nPreferred has been given and if the funds\nnecessary for the redemption have been set\naside by us for the benefit of the holders of\nany shares of the Preferred so called for\nredemption, then, from and after the\nredemption date, those shares shall no longer\nbe deemed outstanding and all rights of the\nholders of those shares (including the right\nto receive any dividends) will terminate,\nexcept the right to receive the redemption\nprice. If less than all of the shares of the\nPreferred held by the Trust are to be redeemed\non a redemption date, then the proceeds from\nsuch redemption will be allocated pro rata to\nthe redemption of the APEX and the Common\nSecurities, except as set forth below under \u0093\u0097\nRanking of Common Securities.\u0094 The term \u0093 like\namount\u0094 as used above means APEX having a\nliquidation amount equal to that portion of\nthe liquidation amount of the Preferred to be\ncontemporaneously redeemed, the proceeds of\nwhich will be used to pay the redemption price\nof such APEX. Distributions to be paid on or\nbefore the redemption date for any APEX called\nfor redemption will be payable to the holders\nas of the record dates for the related dates\nof distribution. If the APEX called for\nredemption are no longer in book-entry form,\nthe Property Trustee, to the extent funds are\navailable, will irrevocably deposit with the\npaying agent for the APEX funds sufficient to\npay the applicable redemption price and will\ngive such paying agent irrevocable\ninstructions and authority to pay the\nredemption price to the holders thereof upon\nsurrender of their certificates evidencing the\nAPEX. If notice of redemption shall have been\ngiven and funds deposited as required, then\nupon the date of such deposit:\n                                              \n      all rights of the holders of such APEX  \n      called for redemption will cease,       \n      except the right of the holders of      \n      such APEX to                            \n      receive the redemption price and any    \n      distribution payable in respect of the  \n      APEX on or prior to the redemption      \n      date, but without interest on such      \n      redemption price; and                   \n                                              \n                                              \n      the APEX called for redemption will     \n      cease to be outstanding. If any         \n      redemption date is not a business day,  \n      then the                                \n      redemption amount will be payable on    \n      the next business day (and without any  \n      interest or other payment in respect    \n      of any such delay). However, if         \n      payment on the next business day        \n      causes payment of the redemption        \n      amount to be in the next calendar       \n      month, then payment will be on the      \n      preceding business day.                 \n                                              \nIf payment of the redemption amount for the\nPreferred held by a Trust called for\nredemption is improperly withheld or refused\nand accordingly the redemption amount of the\nTrust\u0092s APEX is not paid either by the Trust\nor by us under the applicable Guarantee, then\ndividends on the Preferred called for\nredemption will continue to accrue and\ndistributions on such series of APEX called\nfor redemption will continue to accumulate at\nthe applicable rate then borne by such APEX\nfrom the original redemption date scheduled to\nthe actual date of payment. In this case, the\nactual payment date will be considered the\nredemption date for purposes of calculating\nthe redemption amount. Redemptions of the APEX\nwill require prior approval of the Federal\nReserve Board. We will not exercise our option\nto redeem any shares of the Preferred without\nobtaining the approval of the Federal Reserve\nBoard (or any successor appropriate federal\nbanking agency) as required by applicable law.\nUnless the Federal Reserve Board (or any\nsuccessor appropriate federal 19\n\nbanking agency) authorizes us to do otherwise\nin writing, we will redeem the Preferred only\nif it is replaced with other tier 1 capital\nthat is not a restricted core capital element\n(e.g., common stock or another series of\nnoncumulative perpetual preferred stock). We\nalso must comply with the Replacement Capital\nCovenants described in this prospectus. If\nless than all of the outstanding shares of the\nPreferred held by a Trust are to be redeemed\non a redemption date, then the aggregate\nliquidation amount of APEX and Common\nSecurities of that Trust to be redeemed shall\nbe allocated pro rata to the APEX and Common\nSecurities based upon the relative liquidation\namounts of such series, except as set forth\nbelow under \u0093\u0097 Ranking of Common Securities.\u0094\nThe Property Trustee will select the\nparticular APEX to be redeemed on a pro rata\nbasis not more than 60 days before the\nredemption date from the outstanding APEX not\npreviously called for redemption by any method\nthe Property Trustee deems fair and\nappropriate, or if the APEX are in book-entry\nonly form, in accordance with the procedures\nof DTC. The Property Trustee shall promptly\nnotify the Transfer Agent in writing of the\nAPEX selected for redemption and, in the case\nof any APEX selected for redemption in part,\nthe liquidation amount to be redeemed. For all\npurposes of the Trust Agreement, unless the\ncontext otherwise requires, all provisions\nrelating to the redemption of APEX shall\nrelate, in the case of any APEX redeemed or to\nbe redeemed only in part, to the portion of\nthe aggregate liquidation amount of APEX that\nhas been or is to be redeemed. If less than\nall of the APEX, the APEX held through the\nfacilities of DTC will be redeemed pro rata in\naccordance with DTC\u0092s internal procedures. See\n\u0093Book-Entry System\u0094 below. Liquidation\nDistribution upon Dissolution Pursuant to each\nTrust Agreement, the applicable Trust shall\ndissolve on the first to occur of:\n                                              \n      certain events of bankruptcy,           \n      dissolution or liquidation of GS        \n      Group;                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      redemption of all of its APEX as        \n      described above; and                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      the entry of an order for the           \n      dissolution of the Trust by a court of  \n      competent jurisdiction.                 \n                                              \nExcept as set forth in the next paragraph, if\nan early dissolution occurs as a result of\ncertain events of bankruptcy, dissolution or\nliquidation of GS Group, the Property Trustee\nand the administrative trustees will liquidate\nthe Trust as expeditiously as they determine\npossible by distributing, after satisfaction\nof liabilities to creditors of the Trust as\nprovided by applicable law, to each holder of\nits APEX a like amount of the Preferred held\nby the Trust as of the date of such\ndistribution. Except as set forth in the next\nparagraph, if an early dissolution occurs as a\nresult of the entry of an order for the\ndissolution of the Trust by a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction, the Property Trustee\nwill liquidate the Trust as expeditiously as\nit determines to be possible by distributing,\nafter satisfaction of liabilities to creditors\nof the Trust as provided by applicable law, to\neach holder of its APEX a like amount of the\nPreferred held by the Trust as of the date of\nsuch distribution. The Property Trustee shall\ngive notice of liquidation to each holder of\nAPEX at least 30 days and not more than 60\ndays before the date of liquidation. If,\nwhether because of an order for dissolution\nentered by a court of competent jurisdiction\nor otherwise, the Property Trustee determines\nthat distribution of the Preferred in the\nmanner provided above is not possible, or if\nthe early dissolution occurs as a result of\nthe redemption of all the APEX, the Property\nTrustee shall liquidate the property of the\nTrust and wind up its affairs. In that case,\nupon the winding up of the Trust, except with\nrespect to an early dissolution that occurs as\na result of the redemption of all the APEX,\nthe holders will be entitled to receive out of\nthe assets of the Trust available for\ndistribution to holders and after satisfaction\nof liabilities to creditors of the Trust as\nprovided by applicable law, an amount equal to\nthe aggregate liquidation amount per Trust\nsecurity 20\n\nplus accrued and unpaid distributions to the\ndate of payment. If, upon any such winding up,\nthe Trust has insufficient assets available to\npay in full such aggregate liquidation\ndistribution, then the amounts payable\ndirectly by the Trust on its Trust securities\nshall be paid on a pro rata basis, except as\nset forth above under \u0093\u0097 Ranking of Common\nSecurities.\u0094 The term \u0093like amount\u0094 as used\nabove means Preferred having a liquidation\npreference equal to the liquidation amount of\nthe APEX of the holder to whom such Preferred\nwould be distributed. Distribution of Trust\nAssets Upon liquidation of a Trust other than\nas a result of an early dissolution upon the\nredemption of all the APEX and after\nsatisfaction of the liabilities of creditors\nof the Trust as provided by applicable law,\nthe assets of the Trust will be distributed to\nthe holders of such Trust securities in\nexchange therefor. After the liquidation date\nfixed for any distribution of assets of the\nTrust:\n                                              \n      the APEX will no longer be deemed to    \n      be outstanding;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      DTC or its nominee, as the record       \n      holder of the APEX, will receive a      \n      registered global certificate or        \n      certificates                            \n      representing the Preferred to be        \n      delivered upon such distribution;       \n                                              \n                                              \n      any certificates representing the APEX  \n      not held by DTC or its nominee will be  \n      deemed to represent shares of the       \n      Preferred                               \n      having a Liquidation Preference equal   \n      to the APEX until such certificates     \n      are so surrendered for transfer and     \n      reissuance; and                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      all rights of the holders of the APEX   \n      will cease, except the right to         \n      receive Preferred upon such surrender.  \n                                              \nSince each APEX corresponds to 1/100th of a\nshare of Preferred, holders of APEX may\nreceive fractional shares of the Preferred or\ndepositary shares representing the Preferred\nupon this distribution. Ranking of Common\nSecurities If on any Distribution Date a Trust\ndoes not have funds available from dividends\non the Preferred it holds to make full\ndistributions on its APEX and Common\nSecurities, then the available funds from\ndividends on the Preferred it holds shall be\napplied first to make distributions then due\non its APEX on a pro rata basis on such\nDistribution Date up to the amount of such\ndistributions corresponding to dividends on\nthe Preferred (or if less, the amount of the\ncorresponding distributions that would have\nbeen made on the APEX had we paid a full\ndividend on the Preferred) before any such\namount is applied to make a distribution on\nthe Trust\u0092s Common Securities on such\nDistribution Date. If on any date where APEX\nand Common Securities must be redeemed because\nwe are redeeming Preferred and a Trust does\nnot have funds available from our redemption\nof the Preferred it holds to pay the full\nredemption price then due on all of its\noutstanding APEX and Common Securities to be\nredeemed, then (i) the available funds shall\nbe applied first to pay the redemption price\non the APEX to be redeemed on such redemption\ndate and (ii) Common Securities shall be\nredeemed only to the extent funds are\navailable for such purpose after the payment\nof the full redemption price on the APEX to be\nredeemed. If an early dissolution event occurs\nin respect of a Trust, no liquidation\ndistributions shall be made on its Common\nSecurities until full liquidation\ndistributions have been made on its APEX. In\nthe case of any event of default under the\nTrust Agreement of a Trust resulting from our\nfailure to comply in any material respect with\nany of our obligations as issuer of the\nPreferred held by the 21\n\nTrust, including obligations set forth in our\nrestated certificate of incorporation, as\namended, or \u0093restated certificate of\nincorporation,\u0094 or arising under applicable\nlaw, we, as holder of its Common Securities,\nwill be deemed to have waived any right to act\nwith respect to any such event of default\nunder the Trust Agreement until the effect of\nall such events of default with respect to its\nAPEX have been cured, waived or otherwise\neliminated. Until all events of default under\nthe Trust Agreement have been so cured, waived\nor otherwise eliminated, the Property Trustee\nshall act solely on behalf of the holders of\nits APEX and not on our behalf, and only the\nholders of its APEX will have the right to\ndirect the Property Trustee to act on their\nbehalf. Events of Default; Notice Any one of\nthe following events constitutes an event of\ndefault under a Trust Agreement, or a \u0093Trust\nEvent of Default,\u0094 regardless of the reason\nfor such event of default and whether it shall\nbe voluntary or involuntary or be effected by\noperation of law or pursuant to any judgment,\ndecree or order of any court or any order,\nrule or regulation of any administrative or\ngovernmental body:\n                                              \n      the failure to comply in any material   \n      respect with our obligations as issuer  \n      of the Preferred, under our restated    \n      certificate of incorporation, or those  \n      of the Trust, or arising under          \n      applicable law;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      the default by the Trust in the         \n      payment of any distribution on any      \n      Trust security of the Trust when such   \n      becomes due and                         \n      payable, and continuation of such       \n      default for a period of 30 days;        \n                                              \n                                              \n      the default by the Trust in the         \n      payment of any redemption price of any  \n      Trust security of the Trust when such   \n      becomes due                             \n      and payable;                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      the failure to perform or the breach,   \n      in any material respect, of any other   \n      covenant or warranty of the trustees    \n      in the                                  \n      Trust Agreement for 90 days after the   \n      defaulting trustee or trustees have     \n      received written notice of the failure  \n      to perform or breach in the manner      \n      specified in such Trust Agreement; or   \n                                              \n                                              \n      the occurrence of certain events of     \n      bankruptcy or insolvency with respect   \n      to the Property Trustee and our         \n      failure to                              \n      appoint a successor Property Trustee    \n      within 90 days.                         \n                                              \nWithin 30 days after any Trust Event of\nDefault with respect to a Trust actually known\nto the Property Trustee occurs, the Property\nTrustee will transmit notice of such Trust\nEvent of Default to the holders of its APEX\nand to the administrative trustees, unless\nsuch Trust Event of Default shall have been\ncured or waived. We, as sponsor, and the\nadministrative trustees are required to file\nannually with the Property Trustee a\ncertificate as to whether or not we or they\nare in compliance with all the conditions and\ncovenants applicable to us and to them under\nthe Trust Agreement. Removal of Trustees The\nProperty Trustee and/or the Delaware Trustee\nof a Trust may be removed at any time by the\nholder of its Common Securities. In no event\nwill the holders of its APEX have the right to\nvote to appoint, remove or replace the\nadministrative trustees, which voting rights\nare vested exclusively in us, as the holder of\nits Common Securities. No resignation or\nremoval of a trustee and no appointment of a\nsuccessor trustee shall be effective until the\nacceptance of appointment by the successor\ntrustee in accordance with the provisions of\nthe Trust Agreement. Co-Trusteesand Separate\nProperty Trustee Unless an event of default\nunder the Indenture shall have occurred and be\ncontinuing, at any time or from time to time,\nfor the purpose of meeting the legal\nrequirements of any jurisdiction in which any\n22\n\npart of the Trust property may at the time be\nlocated, we, as the holder of the Common\nSecurities, and the administrative trustees\nshall have the power to appoint one or more\npersons either to act as a co-trustee,jointly\nwith the Property Trustee, of all or any part\nof such Trust property, or to act as separate\ntrustee of any such property, in either case\nwith such powers as may be provided in the\ninstrument of appointment, and to vest in such\nperson or persons in such capacity any\nproperty, title, right or power deemed\nnecessary or desirable, subject to the\nprovisions of such Trust Agreement. Merger or\nConsolidation of Trustees Any person into\nwhich the Property Trustee or the Delaware\nTrustee, if not a natural person, may be\nmerged or converted or with which it may be\nconsolidated, or any person resulting from any\nmerger, conversion or consolidation to which\nsuch trustee shall be a party, or any person\nsucceeding to all or substantially all the\ncorporate trust business of such trustee,\nshall be the successor of such trustee under\neach Trust Agreement, provided that such\nperson shall be otherwise qualified and\neligible. Mergers, Consolidations,\nAmalgamations or Replacements of a Trust A\nTrust may not merge with or into, consolidate,\namalgamate, or be replaced by, or convey,\ntransfer or lease its properties and assets\nsubstantially as an entirety to us or any\nother person, except as described below or as\notherwise described in its Trust Agreement.

General. Any required approval of\nholders of APEX may be given at a meeting of\nholders convened for such purpose or pursuant\nto written consent. The Property Trustee will\ncause a notice of any meeting at which holders\nare entitled to vote, or of any matter upon\nwhich action by written consent of such\nholders is to be taken, to be given to each\nrecord holder in the manner set forth in the\nTrust Agreement. No vote or consent of the\nholders of APEX will be required for a Trust\nto redeem and cancel the APEX in accordance\nwith a Trust Agreement.

If any APEX are not held\nby DTC, such payments shall be made by check\nmailed to the address of the holder as such\naddress shall appear on the register.

The paying agent\nshall be permitted to resign as paying agent\nupon 30 days\u0092 written notice to the\nadministrative trustees and to the Property\nTrustee. In the event that The Bank of New\nYork Mellon shall no longer be the paying\nagent, the Property Trustee will appoint a\nsuccessor to act as paying agent, which will\nbe a bank or trust company acceptable to the\nadministrative trustees and to us. 25\n\nRegistrar and Transfer Agent The Bank of New\nYork Mellon acts as registrar and transfer\nagent, or \u0093Transfer Agent,\u0094 for the APEX.\nRegistration of transfers of APEX are effected\nwithout charge by or on behalf of each Trust,\nbut upon payment of any tax or other\ngovernmental charges that may be imposed in\nconnection with any transfer or exchange.\nNeither a Trust nor the Transfer Agent shall\nbe required to register the transfer of or\nexchange any Trust security during a period\nbeginning at the opening of business 15 days\nbefore the day of selection for redemption of\nTrust securities and ending at the close of\nbusiness on the day of mailing of notice of\nredemption or to transfer or exchange any\nTrust security so selected for redemption in\nwhole or in part, except, in the case of any\nTrust security to be redeemed in part, any\nportion thereof not to be redeemed. Any APEX\ncan be exchanged for other APEX of the same\nTrust so long as such other APEX are\ndenominated in authorized denominations and\nhave the same aggregate liquidation amount and\nsame terms as the APEX that were surrendered\nfor exchange. The APEX may be presented for\nregistration of transfer, duly endorsed or\naccompanied by a satisfactory written\ninstrument of transfer, at the office or\nagency maintained by us for that purpose in a\nplace of payment. There is no service charge\nfor any registration of transfer or exchange\nof the APEX, but we may require holders to pay\nany tax or other governmental charge payable\nin connection with a transfer or exchange of\nthe APEX. We may at any time rescind the\ndesignation or approve a change in the\nlocation of any office or agency, in addition\nto the security registrar, designated by us\nwhere holders can surrender the APEX for\nregistration of transfer or exchange. However,\neach Trust is required to maintain an office\nor agency in each place of payment for the\nAPEX. Information Concerning the Property\nTrustee Other than during the occurrence and\ncontinuance of a Trust Event of Default, the\nProperty Trustee undertakes to perform only\nthe duties that are specifically set forth in\nthe Trust Agreement. After a Trust Event of\nDefault, the Property Trustee must exercise\nthe same degree of care and skill as a prudent\nindividual would exercise or use in the\nconduct of his or her own affairs. Subject to\nthis provision, the Property Trustee is under\nno obligation to exercise any of the powers\nvested in it by the Trust Agreement at the\nrequest of any holder of APEX unless it is\noffered indemnity satisfactory to it by such\nholder against the costs, expenses and\nliabilities that might be incurred. If no\nTrust Event of Default has occurred and is\ncontinuing and the Property Trustee is\nrequired to decide between alternative courses\nof action, construe ambiguous provisions in\nthe Trust Agreement or is unsure of the\napplication of any provision of the Trust\nAgreement, and the matter is not one upon\nwhich holders of APEX are entitled under the\nTrust Agreement to vote, then the Property\nTrustee will take any action that we direct.\nIf we do not provide direction, the Property\nTrustee may take any action that it deems\nadvisable and in the interests of the holders\nof the Trust securities and will have no\nliability except for its own bad faith,\nnegligence or willful misconduct. We and our\naffiliates may maintain certain accounts and\nother banking relationships with the Property\nTrustee and its affiliates in the ordinary\ncourse of business.

Pursuant to each\nGuarantee, we irrevocably and unconditionally\nagree to pay in full the guarantee payments,\nwithout duplication:\n                                              \n      any accumulated and unpaid              \n      distributions required to be paid on    \n      the APEX, to the extent the Trust has   \n      funds available to                      \n      make the payment;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      the redemption price for any APEX       \n      called for redemption, to the extent    \n      the Trust has funds available to make   \n      the payment;                            \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      upon a voluntary or involuntary         \n      dissolution, winding up or liquidation  \n      of the Trust, other than in connection  \n      with a                                  \n      distribution of a like amount of        \n      corresponding assets to the holders of  \n      the APEX, the lesser of:                \n                                              \n                                              \n      the aggregate of the liquidation        \n      amount and all accumulated and unpaid   \n      distributions on the APEX to the date   \n      of payment, to                          \n      the extent the Trust has funds          \n      available to make the payment; and      \n                                              \n                                              \n      the amount of assets of the Trust       \n      remaining available for distribution    \n      to holders of the APEX upon             \n      liquidation of the                      \n      Trust.                                  \n                                              \nOur obligation to make a guarantee payment may\nbe satisfied by direct payment of the required\namounts by us to the holders of the APEX or by\ncausing the Trust to pay the amounts to the\nholders. If we do not make a regular dividend\npayment on the Preferred held by a Trust, the\nTrust will not have sufficient funds to make\nthe related payments on the relevant series of\nAPEX. The Guarantee does not cover payments on\nthe APEX when the Trust does not have\nsufficient funds to make these payments.\nBecause we are a holding company, our rights\nto participate in the assets of any of our\nsubsidiaries upon the subsidiary\u0092s liquidation\nor reorganization will be subject to the prior\nclaims of the subsidiary\u0092s creditors except to\nthe extent that we may ourselves be a creditor\nwith recognized claims against the subsidiary.\nThe Guarantee does not limit the incurrence or\nissuance by us of other secured or unsecured\nindebtedness. Each Guarantee is qualified as\nan indenture under the Trust Indenture Act.\nThe Bank of New York Mellon acts as \u0093Guarantee\nTrustee\u0094 for each Guarantee for purposes of\ncompliance with the provisions of the Trust\nIndenture Act. The Guarantee Trustee holds\neach Guarantee for the benefit of the holders\nof APEX. Effect of the Guarantees Each\nGuarantee, when taken together with our\nobligations and the Trust\u0092s obligations under\nthe Trust Agreement, including the obligations\nto pay costs, expenses, debts and liabilities\nof the applicable Trust, other than with\nrespect to its Trust securities, has the\neffect of providing a full and unconditional\nguarantee, on a subordinated basis, of\npayments due on its APEX. 28\n\nWe have also agreed separately to irrevocably\nand unconditionally guarantee the obligations\nof each Trust with respect to its Common\nSecurities to the same extent as the\nGuarantee. Status of the Guarantees Each\nGuarantee is unsecured and ranks:\n                                              \n      subordinate and junior in right of      \n      payment to all our senior and           \n      subordinated debt; and                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      equally with any of our other present   \n      or future obligations that by their     \n      terms rank pari passu with such         \n      Guarantee.                              \n                                              \nEach Guarantee constitutes a guarantee of\npayment and not of collection, which means\nthat the guaranteed party may sue the\nguarantor to enforce its rights under the\nGuarantee without suing any other person or\nentity. Each Guarantee is held for the benefit\nof the holders of APEX. Each Guarantee will be\ndischarged only by payment of the guarantee\npayments in full to the extent not paid by the\napplicable Trust. To the fullest extent\npermitted by applicable law, each holder of\nAPEX has the right to institute a proceeding\ndirectly against us for enforcement of the\nrights of a holder of Preferred to the extent\nof an interest in the Preferred corresponding\nto the aggregate liquidation amount of such\nholder\u0092s APEX. Amendments and Assignment A\nGuarantee may be amended only with the prior\napproval of the holders of not less than a\nmajority in aggregate liquidation amount of\nthe applicable outstanding APEX. No vote is\nrequired, however, for any changes that do not\nadversely affect the rights of holders of APEX\nin any material respect. All guarantees and\nagreements contained in the Guarantee bind our\nsuccessors, assignees, receivers, trustees and\nrepresentatives and are for the benefit of the\nholders of the applicable APEX then\noutstanding. Termination of the Guarantees A\nGuarantee will terminate:\n                                              \n      upon full payment of the redemption     \n      price of all applicable APEX; or        \n                                              \n                                              \n      upon full payment of the amounts        \n      payable in accordance with the Trust    \n      Agreement upon liquidation of the       \n      Trust.                                  \n                                              \nA Guarantee will continue to be effective or\nwill be reinstated, as the case may be, if at\nany time any holder of APEX must restore\npayment of any sums paid under the APEX or the\nGuarantee. Events of Default An event of\ndefault under a Guarantee will occur if we\nfail to perform any payment obligation or if\nwe fail to perform any other obligation under\nthe Guarantee and such default remains\nunremedied for 30 days. The holders of a\nmajority in liquidation amount of the\napplicable APEX have the right to direct the\ntime, method and place of conducting any\nproceeding for any remedy available to the\nGuarantee Trustee in respect of a Guarantee or\nto direct the exercise of any trust or power\nconferred upon the Guarantee Trustee under the\nGuarantee. Any holder of APEX may institute a\nlegal proceeding directly against us to\nenforce the Guarantee Trustee\u0092s rights and our\nobligations under a Guarantee, without first\ninstituting a legal proceeding against the\nTrust, the Guarantee Trustee or any other\nperson or entity. 29\n\nAs guarantor, we are required to file annually\nwith the Guarantee Trustee a certificate as to\nwhether\nor not we are in compliance with all\napplicable conditions and covenants under the\nGuarantee.\n\nInformation Concerning the Guarantee Trustee\n\nPrior to the occurrence of an event of default\nrelating to a Guarantee, the Guarantee Trustee\nis required to perform only the duties that\nare\nspecifically set forth in the Guarantees.\nFollowing the occurrence of an event of\ndefault, the Guarantee Trustee will exercise\nthe same degree of care as a prudent\nindividual would exercise in the conduct of\nhis or her own affairs. Provided that the\nforegoing requirements have been met, the\nGuarantee Trustee is under no obligation to\nexercise any of the powers vested in it by the\nGuarantees at the request of any holder of\nAPEX, unless offered indemnity satisfactory to\nit against the costs,\nexpenses and liabilities which might be\nincurred thereby.\n\nWe and our affiliates may maintain certain\naccounts and other banking relationships with\nthe Guarantee Trustee and its affiliates in\nthe ordinary course of business.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe Guarantees are governed by, and construed\nin accordance with, the laws of the State of\nNew York.\n\nLimited Purpose of Trust\n\nThe Trust securities\nevidence beneficial interests in the Trust. A\nprincipal difference between the rights of a\nholder of a Trust security and a holder of\nPreferred is that a holder of Preferred would\nbe entitled to receive from the issuer the\ndividends, redemption\npayments and payment upon liquidation in\nrespect of Preferred while a holder of Trust\nsecurities is entitled to receive\ndistributions from a Trust, or from us under a\nGuarantee, if and to the extent the Trust has\nfunds available for the payment of\nsuch distributions.\n\nRights upon Dissolution\n\nUpon any voluntary or involuntary dissolution\nof the Trust, holders of each series of APEX\nwill receive the distributions described under\n\u0093Description of the APEX \u0097 Liquidation\nDistribution upon Dissolution\u0094 above. Upon any\nvoluntary or involuntary liquidation or\nbankruptcy of GS Group, the holders of the\nPreferred would be preferred shareholders of\nGS Group, entitled\nto the preferences upon liquidation described\nunder \u0093Description of the Preferred\u0094 below.\nSince we are the guarantor under the Guarantee\nand have agreed to pay for all costs, expenses\nand liabilities of the Trust, other than the\nTrust\u0092s obligations to the holders of the\nTrust securities, the positions of a holder of\nAPEX relative to other creditors and to our\nshareholders in the event of liquidation or\nbankruptcy are expected to be substantially\nthe same as if that\nholder held the corresponding assets of the\nTrust directly.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED\n\nThe following is a brief description of the\nterms of the Preferred held by the relevant\nTrust. This summary does not purport to be\ncomplete in all respects and is subject to and\nqualified in its entirety by reference to our\nrestated certificate of incorporation, as\namended, including the certificate of\ndesignations with respect to the Preferred,\ncopies of which are available upon request\nfrom us as described under \u0093Summary \u0097 Where\ncan I find additional information?\u0094 above.\n\nGeneral\n\nOur authorized capital stock includes\n150,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par\nvalue $0.01 per share (including the\nPreferred). We have 340,282 shares\nof perpetual non-cumulative preferred stock\n\n30\n\n(designated in thirteen separate series), with\na liquidation preference of $25,000 per share\n(except for two series that have a liquidation\npreference of $100,000), issued as of the date\nof this\nprospectus.\n\nShares of the Preferred rank senior to our\ncommon stock, equally with our Outstanding\nPreferred, and at least equally with each\nother\nseries of our preferred stock we may issue\n(except for any senior series that may be\nissued with the requisite consent of the\nholders of the Preferred), with respect to the\npayment of dividends and distributions upon\nliquidation, dissolution or winding-up. The\nPreferred is fully paid and nonassessable,\nwhich means that its holders have paid their\npurchase price in full and that we may not ask\nthem to surrender additional funds. Holders of\nthe Preferred do\nnot have preemptive or subscription rights to\nacquire more preferred stock of GS Group. The\nPreferred is not be convertible into, or\nexchangeable for, shares of any other class or\nseries of stock or other securities of GS\nGroup. The Preferred has no\nstated maturity and is not subject to any\nsinking fund or other obligation of GS Group\nto redeem or repurchase the Preferred.\n\nOur authorized\ncapital stock includes 150,000,000 shares of\npreferred stock, par value $0.01 per share,\n50,000 shares of which are designated as\nSeries A Preferred Stock, 25,000 shares of\nwhich are designated as Series C Preferred\nStock, 60,000 of which are\ndesignated as Series D Preferred Stock, 17,500\nof which are designated as Series E Preferred\nStock, 5,000 of which are designated as Series\nF Preferred Stock, 46,000 of which are\ndesignated as Series J Preferred Stock, 32,200\nof which are designated\nas Series K Preferred Stock, 31,050 of which\nare designated as Series N Preferred Stock,\n26,000 of which are designated as Series O\nPreferred Stock, 66,000 of which are\ndesignated as Series P Stock, 20,000 of which\nare designated as Series Q\nPreferred Stock, 24,000 of which are\ndesignated as Series R Preferred Stock and\n14,000 of which are designated as Series S\nPreferred Stock. We have 29,999 shares of\nSeries A Preferred Stock, 8,000 shares of\nSeries C Preferred Stock, 53,999 shares of\nSeries D Preferred Stock, 7,667 shares of\nSeries E Preferred Stock, 1,615 shares of\nSeries F Preferred Stock, 40,000 shares of\nSeries J Preferred Stock, 28,000 shares of\nSeries K Preferred Stock, 27,000 shares of\nSeries N Preferred Stock, 26,000\nshares of Series O Preferred Stock, 60,000\nshares of Series P Preferred Stock, 20,000\nshares of Series Q Preferred Stock, 24,000\nshares of Series R Preferred Stock and 14,000\nshares of Series S outstanding as of the date\nof this prospectus.\n\nThe Preferred has a fixed liquidation\npreference of $100,000 per share. If we\nliquidate, dissolve or wind up our affairs,\nholders of the Preferred will\nbe entitled to receive, out of our assets that\nare available for distribution to\nshareholders, an amount per share equal to the\nliquidation preference per share, plus any\ndeclared and unpaid dividends, without regard\nto any undeclared dividends.\n\nUnless the Trust is dissolved prior to the\nredemption of the Preferred, holders of APEX\nwill not receive shares of the Preferred, and\ntheir\ninterest in the Preferred will be represented\nby their APEX. If the Trust is dissolved, we\nmay elect to distribute depositary shares\nrepresenting the Preferred instead of\nfractional shares. Since the Preferred is held\nby the Property Trustee,\nholders of APEX are only able to exercise\nvoting or other rights with respect to the\nPreferred through the Property Trustee.\n\nDividends\n\nDividends on shares of the Preferred are not\nmandatory. Holders of the Preferred are\nentitled to receive, when, as and if declared\nby our board of\ndirectors (or a duly authorized committee of\nthe board), out of funds legally available for\nthe payment of dividends under Delaware law,\nnon-cumulative cash dividends from the date of\ntheir issuance. These\ndividends are payable on March 1, June 1,\nSeptember 1 and December 1 of each year (each,\na \u0093Dividend Payment Date\u0094), with respect to\nthe Dividend Period, or portion thereof,\nending on the day preceding the respective\nDividend Payment Date, at a rate per annum\nequal to the greater of (x) three-month LIBOR\nfor the related distribution period plus\n0.765% (in the case of the Series E) or 0.77%\n(in the case of the Series F) and (y) 4.000%.\n\n31\n\nDividends are payable to holders of record of\nthe Preferred as they appear on our books on\nthe applicable record date, which shall be the\n15th calendar day before that Dividend Payment\nDate or such other record date fixed by our\nboard of directors (or a duly authorized\ncommittee of the board) that is not more than\n60 nor less than 10 days prior to such\ndividend payment date (each, a \u0093Dividend\nRecord Date\u0094). These Dividend Record Dates\napply regardless of whether a particular\nDividend Record Date is a business day. A\n\u0093Dividend Period\u0094 is the period from and\nincluding a Dividend Payment Date to but\nexcluding the next Dividend Payment Date. If\nany that would otherwise be a Dividend Payment\nDate is not a business day, then the next\nbusiness day will be the applicable Dividend\nPayment Date. The amount of dividends payable\nper share of the Preferred on each Dividend\nPayment Date are calculated by multiplying the\nper annum Dividend Rate in effect for that\nDividend Period by a fraction, the numerator\nof which is the actual number of days in that\nDividend Period and the denominator of which\nis 360, and multiplying the rate obtained by\n$100,000. For any Dividend Period, LIBOR shall\nbe determined by GS&Co., as calculation agent\nfor the Preferred, on the second London\nbusiness day immediately preceding the first\nday of such Dividend Period, as the case may\nbe, in the following manner:\n                                              \n      LIBOR will be the offered rate per      \n      annum for three-month deposits in U.S.  \n      dollars, beginning on the first day of  \n      such                                    \n      period, as that rate appears on         \n      Reuters Screen LIBOR01 (or any          \n      successor or replacement page) as of    \n      11:00 A.M., London time, on the second  \n      London business day immediately         \n      preceding the first day of such         \n      Dividend Period or Interest Period, as  \n      the                                     \n      case may be.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      If the rate described above does not    \n      appear on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 (or    \n      any successor or replacement page),     \n      LIBOR will be                           \n      determined on the basis of the rates,   \n      at approximately 11:00 A.M., London     \n      time, on the second London business     \n      day immediately preceding the first     \n      day of such Dividend Period or          \n      Interest Period, as the case may be,    \n      at which deposits of the following      \n      kind are offered to prime banks in the  \n      London interbank market by four major   \n      banks in that market selected by the    \n      calculation agent: three-month          \n      deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning on  \n      the first day of such Dividend Period   \n      or Interest Period, as the              \n      case may be, and in a Representative    \n      Amount. The calculation agent will      \n      request the principal London office of  \n      each of these banks to provide a        \n      quotation of its rate. If at least two  \n      quotations are provided, LIBOR for the  \n      second London business day              \n      immediately preceding the first day of  \n      such Dividend Period or Interest        \n      Period, as the case may be, will be     \n      the arithmetic mean of the quotations.  \n                                              \n                                              \n      If fewer than two quotations are        \n      provided as described above, LIBOR for  \n      the second London business day          \n      immediately                             \n      preceding the first day of such         \n      Dividend Period or Interest Period, as  \n      the case may be, will be the            \n      arithmetic mean of the rates for loans  \n      of the following kind to leading        \n      European banks quoted, at               \n      approximately 11:00 A.M. New York City  \n      time on the                             \n      second London business day immediately  \n      preceding the first day of such         \n      Dividend Period or Interest Period, as  \n      the case may be, by three major banks   \n      in New York City selected by the        \n      calculation agent: three-month loans    \n      of U.S. dollars, beginning on           \n      the first day of such Dividend Period,  \n      and in a Representative Amount.         \n                                              \n                                              \n      If fewer than three banks selected by   \n      the calculation agent are quoting as    \n      described above, LIBOR for the new      \n      Dividend                                \n      Period will be LIBOR in effect for the  \n      prior Dividend Period or Interest       \n      Period, as the case may be.             \n                                              \nThe calculation agent\u0092s determination of any\ndividend rate, and its calculation of the\namount of dividends for any Dividend Period,\nwill be on file at our principal offices, will\nbe made available to any stockholder upon\nrequest and will be final and binding in the\nabsence of manifest error. 32\n\nIn this subsection, we use several terms that\nhave special meanings relevant to calculating\nLIBOR. We\ndefine these terms as follows:\n\nThe term \u0093Representative Amount\u0094 means an\namount that, in the calculation agent\u0092s\njudgment, is\nrepresentative of a single transaction in the\nrelevant market at the relevant time.\n\n\u0093Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page\u0094 means the\ndisplay\ndesignated on Thomson Reuters Eikon (or such\nother page as may replace that page on that\nservice or such other service as may be\nnominated by the British Bankers\u0092 Association\nfor the purpose of displaying London interbank\noffered rates for\nU.S. Dollar deposits).\n\nThe term \u0093business day\u0094 means a day that is a\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday\nand is not a day\non which banking institutions in New York City\ngenerally are authorized or obligated by law\nor executive order to close.\n\nThe term \u0093London\nbusiness day\u0094 means a day that is a Monday,\nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and is\na day on which dealings in U.S. dollars are\ntransacted in the London interbank market. If\nwe determine not to pay any dividend or a full\ndividend, we will\nprovide prior written notice to the Property\nTrustee, who will notify holders of APEX, and\nthe administrative trustees.\n\nDividends on the Preferred\nare not cumulative. Accordingly, if the board\nof directors of GS Group (or a duly authorized\ncommittee of the board) does not declare a\ndividend on the Preferred payable in respect\nof any Dividend Period before the related\nDividend Payment Date,\nsuch dividend will not accrue and we will have\nno obligation to pay a dividend for that\nDividend Period on the Dividend Payment Date\nor at any future time, whether or not\ndividends on the Preferred are declared for\nany future Dividend Period.\n\nSo long as any share of Preferred remains\noutstanding, no dividend shall be paid or\ndeclared on our common stock or any other\nshares of our Junior Stock\n(as defined below) (other than a dividend\npayable solely in Junior Stock), and no common\nstock or other Junior Stock shall be\npurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for\nconsideration by us, directly or indirectly\n(other than as a result of a\nreclassification of Junior Stock for or into\nother Junior Stock, or the exchange or\nconversion of one share of Junior Stock for or\ninto another share of Junior Stock and other\nthan through the use of the proceeds of a\nsubstantially contemporaneous\nsale of Junior Stock), during a Dividend\nPeriod, unless the full dividends for the\nlatest completed Dividend Period on all\noutstanding shares of Preferred have been\ndeclared and paid (or declared and a sum\nsufficient for the payment thereof has been\nset aside). However, the foregoing provision\nshall not restrict the ability of GS&Co., or\nany of our other affiliates, to engage in any\nmarket-making transactions in our Junior Stock\nin the ordinary course of business.\n\nAs used in this prospectus, \u0093Junior Stock\u0094\nmeans any class or series of stock of GS Group\nthat ranks junior to the Preferred either as\nto the\npayment of dividends or as to the distribution\nof assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding up of GS Group\u0092s Junior Stock includes\nGS Group\u0092s common stock.\n\nWhen dividends are not paid (or declared and a\nsum sufficient for payment thereof set aside)\non any Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case\nof Parity\nStock, as defined below, having Dividend\nPayment Dates different from the Dividend\nPayment Dates pertaining to the Preferred, on\na Dividend Payment Date falling within the\nrelated Dividend Period for the Preferred) in\nfull upon the Preferred and any\nshares of Parity Stock, all dividends declared\nupon the Preferred and all such equally\nranking securities payable on such Dividend\nPayment Date (or, in the case of parity stock\nhaving dividend payment dates different from\nthe dividend payment dates\npertaining to the Preferred, on a dividend\npayment date falling within the related\nDividend Period for the Preferred) shall be\ndeclared pro rata so\n\n33\n\nthat the respective amounts of such dividends\nshall bear the same ratio to each other as all\naccrued but unpaid dividends per share on the\nPreferred and all Parity Stock payable on such\nDividend Payment Date (or, in the case of\nparity stock having dividend payment dates\ndifferent from the dividend payment dates\npertaining to the Preferred, on a dividend\npayment date falling within the related\nDividend Period for the Preferred) bear to\neach other. As used in this prospectus,\n\u0093Parity Stock\u0094 means any other class or series\nof stock of GS Group that ranks equally with\nthe Preferred in the payment of dividends and\nin the distribution of assets on any\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up of GS\nGroup. Parity Stock includes the Authorized\nPreferred. Subject to the foregoing, such\ndividends (payable in cash, stock or\notherwise) as may be determined by our board\nof directors (or a duly authorized committee\nof the board) may be declared and paid on our\ncommon stock and any other stock ranking\nequally with or junior to the Preferred from\ntime to time out of any funds legally\navailable for such payment, and the shares of\nthe Preferred shall not be entitled to\nparticipate in any such dividend. Redemption\nThe Preferred may be redeemed (but subject to\nthe limitations described below under\n\u0093Replacement Capital Covenants\u0094 and applicable\nregulatory limits) in whole or in part, at our\noption. Any such redemption will be at a cash\nredemption price of $100,000 per share, plus\nany declared and unpaid dividends including,\nwithout regard to any undeclared dividends.\nHolders of Preferred have no right to require\nthe redemption or repurchase of the Preferred.\nIf notice of redemption of any Preferred has\nbeen given and if the funds necessary for the\nredemption have been set aside by us for the\nbenefit of the holders of any shares of the\nPreferred so called for redemption, then, from\nand after the redemption date, those shares\nshall no longer be deemed outstanding and all\nrights of the holders of those shares\n(including the right to receive any dividends)\nwill terminate, except the right to receive\nthe redemption price. If fewer than all of the\noutstanding shares of the Preferred are to be\nredeemed, the shares to be redeemed will be\nselected either pro rata from the holders of\nrecord of shares of the Preferred in\nproportion to the number of shares held by\nthose holders or by lot or in such other\nmanner as our board of directors or a\ncommittee thereof may determine to be fair and\nequitable. We will mail notice of every\nredemption of Preferred by first class mail,\npostage prepaid, addressed to the holders of\nrecord of the Preferred to be redeemed at\ntheir respective last addresses appearing on\nour books. This mailing will be at least 30\ndays and not more than 60 days before the date\nfixed for redemption (provided that if the\nPreferred is held in book-entry form through\nDTC, we may give this notice in any manner\npermitted by DTC). Any notice mailed or\notherwise given as provided in this paragraph\nwill be conclusively presumed to have been\nduly given, whether or not the holder receives\nthis notice, and failure duly to give this\nnotice by mail or otherwise, or any defect in\nthis notice or in the mailing or provision of\nthis notice, to any holder of Preferred\ndesignated for redemption will not affect the\nredemption of any other Preferred. If we\nredeem the Preferred, the Trust, as holder of\nthe Preferred, will redeem the corresponding\nAPEX as described under \u0093Description of the\nAPEX \u0097 Mandatory Redemption of APEX upon\nRedemption of Preferred.\u0094 Each notice shall\nstate:\n                            \n      the redemption date;  \n                            \n                                              \n      the number of shares of the Preferred   \n      to be redeemed and, if less than all    \n      shares of the Preferred held by the     \n      holder are                              \n      to be redeemed, the number of shares    \n      to be redeemed from the holder;         \n                                              \n34\n                                 \n      the redemption price; and  \n                                 \n                                              \n      the place or places where the           \n      Preferred is to be redeemed.            \n                                              \nOur right to redeem the Preferred once issued\nis subject to two important limitations.\nFirst, any redemption of the Preferred is\nsubject to prior approval of the Federal\nReserve Board (or any successor banking\nagency). Second, we have entered into\nReplacement Capital Covenants, described under\n\u0093Replacement Capital Covenants\u0094 below,\nrelating to the APEX and the Preferred. The\nReplacement Capital Covenant only benefits\nholders of Covered Debt, as defined below, and\nis not enforceable by holders of APEX or the\nPreferred. However, the Replacement Capital\nCovenants could preclude us from repurchasing\nAPEX or redeeming or repurchasing shares of\nthe Preferred at a time we might otherwise\nwish to do so. Liquidation Rights Upon any\nvoluntary or involuntary liquidation,\ndissolution or winding up of GS Group, holders\nof the Preferred are entitled to receive out\nof assets of GS Group available for\ndistribution to stockholders, after\nsatisfaction of liabilities to creditors, if\nany, before any distribution of assets is made\nto holders of common stock or of any of our\nother shares of stock ranking junior as to\nsuch a distribution to the shares of the\nPreferred, a liquidating distribution in the\namount of $100,000 per share, plus declared\nand unpaid dividends, without accumulation of\nany undeclared dividends. Holders of the\nPreferred are not entitled to any other\namounts from us after they have received their\nfull liquidation preference. In any such\ndistribution, if the assets of GS Group are\nnot sufficient to pay the liquidation\npreferences in full to all holders of the\nPreferred and all holders of any other shares\nof our stock ranking equally as to such\ndistribution with the Preferred, the amounts\npaid to the holders of the Preferred and to\nthe holders of all such other stock will be\npaid pro rata in accordance with the\nrespective aggregate liquidation preferences\nof those holders. In any such distribution,\nthe \u0093liquidation preference\u0094 of any holder of\npreferred stock means the amount payable to\nsuch holder in such distribution, including\nany declared but unpaid dividends (and any\nunpaid, accrued cumulative dividends in the\ncase of any holder of stock on which dividends\naccrue on a cumulative basis). If the\nliquidation preference has been paid in full\nto all holders of Authorized Preferred and any\nother shares of our stock ranking equally as\nto the liquidation distribution, the holders\nof our other stock shall be entitled to\nreceive all remaining assets of GS Group\naccording to their respective rights and\npreferences. For purposes of this section, the\nmerger or consolidation of GS Group with any\nother entity, including a merger or\nconsolidation in which the holders of\nPreferred receive cash, securities or property\nfor their shares, or the sale, lease or\nexchange of all or substantially all of the\nassets of GS Group for cash, securities or\nother property shall not constitute a\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up of GS\nGroup. Voting Rights Except as provided below,\nthe holders of the Preferred have no voting\nrights. Whenever dividends on any shares of\nthe Preferred shall have not been declared and\npaid for a period the equivalent of six or\nmore dividend payments, whether or not\nconsecutive, equivalent to at least 18 months\nDividend Periods (a \u0093Nonpayment\u0094), the holders\nof such shares, voting together as a class\nwith holders of any and all other series of\nvoting preferred stock (as defined below) then\noutstanding, will be entitled to vote for the\nelection of a total of two additional members\nof our board of directors (the \u0093Preferred\nStock Directors\u0094), provided that the election\nof any such director shall not 35\n\ncause us to violate the corporate governance\nrequirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or\nany other exchange on which our securities may\nbe listed) that listed companies must have a\nmajority of independent directors and provided\nfurther that our board of directors shall at\nno time include more than two Preferred Stock\nDirectors. In that event, the number of\ndirectors on our board of directors shall\nautomatically increase by two, and the new\ndirectors shall be elected at a special\nmeeting called at the request of the holders\nof record of at least 20% of the of record of\nat least 20% of the Preferred or of any other\nseries of voting preferred stock (unless such\nrequest is received less than 90 days before\nthe date fixed for the next annual or special\nmeeting of the stockholders, in which event\nsuch election shall be held at such next\nannual or special meeting of stockholders),\nand at each subsequent annual meeting. These\nvoting rights will continue until dividends on\nthe shares of the Preferred and any such\nseries of voting preferred stock for at least\none year four Dividend Periods, whether or not\nconsecutive, following the Nonpayment shall\nhave been fully paid (or declared and a sum\nsufficient for the payment of such dividends\nshall have been set aside for payment). As\nused in this prospectus, \u0093voting preferred\nstock\u0094 means any other class or series of\npreferred stock of GS Group ranking equally\nwith the Preferred either as to dividends or\nthe distribution of assets upon liquidation,\ndissolution or winding up and upon which like\nvoting rights have been conferred and are\nexercisable. Voting preferred stock includes\nthe Authorized Preferred to the extent their\nlike voting rights are exercisable at such\ntime. Whether a plurality, majority or other\nportion of the shares of the Preferred and any\nother voting preferred stock have been voted\nin favor of any matter shall be determined by\nreference to the liquidation amounts of the\nshares voted. If and when dividends for at\nleast four Dividend Periods, whether or not\nconsecutive, following a Nonpayment have been\npaid in full (or declared and a sum sufficient\nfor such payment shall have been set aside),\nthe holders of the Preferred shall be divested\nof the foregoing voting rights (subject to\nrevesting in the event of each subsequent\nNonpayment) and, if such voting rights for all\nother holders of voting preferred stock have\nterminated, the term of office of each\nPreferred Stock Director so elected shall\nterminate and the number of directors on the\nboard of directors shall automatically\ndecrease by two. In determining whether\ndividends have been paid for at least four\nDividend Periods, whether or not consecutive,\nwe may take account of any dividend we elect\nto pay for a Dividend Period after the regular\ndividend date for that period has passed. Any\nPreferred Stock Director may be removed at any\ntime without cause by the holders of record of\na majority of the outstanding shares of the\nPreferred when they have the voting rights\ndescribed above (voting together as a class\nwith all series of voting preferred stock then\noutstanding). So long as a Nonpayment shall\ncontinue, any vacancy in the office of a\nPreferred Stock Director (other than prior to\nthe initial election after a Nonpayment) may\nbe filled by the written consent of the\nPreferred Stock Director remaining in office,\nor if none remains in office, by a vote of the\nholders of record of a majority of the\noutstanding shares of the Preferred and all\nvoting preferred stock when they have the\nvoting rights described above (voting together\nas a class). The Preferred Stock Directors\nshall each be entitled to one vote per\ndirector on any matter. So long as any shares\nof the Preferred remain outstanding, we will\nnot, without the affirmative vote or consent\nof the holders of at least two-thirdsof the\noutstanding shares of the Preferred and all\nother series of voting preferred stock\nentitled to vote thereon, voting together as a\nsingle class, given in person or by proxy,\neither in writing or at a meeting:\n                                              \n      amend or alter the provisions of GS     \n      Group\u0092s restated certificate of          \n      incorporation or the certificate of     \n      designations                            \n      of the Preferred so as to authorize or  \n      create, or increase the authorized      \n      amount of, any class or series of       \n      stock ranking senior to the Preferred   \n      with respect to payment of dividends    \n      or the distribution of assets upon      \n      liquidation, dissolution or             \n      winding up of GS Group;                 \n                                              \n36\n                                              \n      amend, alter or repeal the provisions   \n      of GS Group\u0092s restated certificate of    \n      incorporation or the certificate of     \n      designation of the Preferred so as to   \n      materially and adversely affect the     \n      special rights, preferences,            \n      privileges and voting powers of the     \n      Preferred, taken as a whole; or         \n                                              \n                                              \n      consummate a binding share exchange or  \n      reclassification involving the          \n      Preferred or a merger or consolidation  \n      of GS Group                             \n      with another entity, unless in each     \n      case (i)\u00a0the shares of the Preferred    \n      remain outstanding or, in the case of   \n      any such merger or consolidation with   \n      of Preferred remain outstanding or, in  \n      the case of any such merger or          \n      consolidation with                      \n      respect to which we are not the         \n      surviving or resulting entity, are      \n      converted into or exchanged for         \n      preference securities of the surviving  \n      or resulting entity or its ultimate     \n      parent, and (ii)\u00a0such shares remaining  \n      outstanding or such preference          \n      securities, as the case may be, have    \n      such rights, preferences, privileges    \n      and voting powers, taken as a whole,    \n      as are not materially less favorable    \n      to the holders thereof than the         \n      rights, preferences, privileges and     \n      voting powers of the Preferred,         \n      taken as a whole;                       \n                                              \nprovided, however, that any increase in the\namount of the authorized or issued Authorized\nPreferred or Preferred or other authorized\npreferred stock or the creation and issuance,\nor an increase in the authorized or issued\namount, of other series of preferred stock\nranking equally with and/or junior to the\nPreferred with respect to the payment of\ndividends (whether such dividends are\ncumulative or non-cumulative)and/or the\ndistribution of assets upon liquidation,\ndissolution or winding up of GS Group will not\nbe deemed to adversely affect the rights,\npreferences, privileges or voting powers of\nthe Preferred. If an amendment, alteration,\nrepeal, share exchange, reclassification,\nmerger or consolidation described above would\nadversely affect one or more but not all\nseries of voting preferred stock (including\nthe Preferred for this purpose), then only the\nseries affected and entitled to vote shall\nvote as a class in lieu of all such series of\npreferred stock. Without the consent of the\nholders of the Preferred, so long as such\naction does not adversely affect the rights,\npreferences, privileges and voting powers of\nthe Preferred, we may amend, alter, supplement\nor repeal any terms of the Preferred:\n                                              \n      to cure any ambiguity, or to cure,      \n      correct or supplement any provision     \n      contained in the certificate of         \n      designations for the                    \n      Preferred that may be defective or      \n      inconsistent; or                        \n                                              \n                                              \n      to make any provision with respect to   \n      matters or questions arising with       \n      respect to the Preferred that is not    \n      inconsistent                            \n      with the provisions of the certificate  \n      of designations.                        \n                                              \nThe foregoing voting provisions do not apply\nif, at or prior to the time when the act with\nrespect to which such vote would otherwise be\nrequired shall be effected, all outstanding\nshares of the Preferred shall have been\nredeemed or called for redemption upon proper\nnotice and sufficient funds shall have been\nset aside by us for the benefit of the holders\nof the Preferred to effect such redemption.\nForm The Preferred are issued only in fully\nregistered form. Other than the fractional\nshares currently held by each Trust, no\nfractional shares will be issued unless a\nTrust is dissolved and we deliver the shares,\nrather than depositary receipts representing\nthe shares, to the registered holders of its\nAPEX. If a Trust is dissolved and depositary\nreceipts or shares of the Preferred held by\nthe Trust are distributed to holders of its\nAPEX, we would intend to distribute them in\nbook-entry form only and the procedures\ngoverning holding and transferring beneficial\ninterests in the Preferred, and the\ncircumstances in which holders of beneficial\ninterests will be entitled to receive\ncertificates evidencing their shares or\ndepositary receipts, will be as described\nunder \u0093Book-Entry System\u0094 below. If we 37\n\ndetermine to issue depositary shares\nrepresenting fractional interests in the\nPreferred, each depositary share will be\nrepresented by a depositary receipt. In such\nan event, the Preferred represented by the\ndepositary shares will be deposited under a\ndeposit agreement among GS Group, a depositary\nand the holders from time to time of the\ndepositary receipts representing depositary\nshares. Subject to the terms and conditions of\nany deposit agreement, each holder of a\ndepositary share will be entitled, through the\ndepositary, in proportion to the applicable\nfraction of a share of the Preferred\nrepresented by such depositary share, to all\nthe rights applicable fraction of a share of\nthe Preferred represented by such depositary\nshare, to all the rights and preferences of\nthe Preferred represented thereby (including\ndividends, voting, redemption and liquidation\nrights). Title We, the transfer agent and\nregistrar for the Preferred held by a Trust,\nand any of their or our agents may treat the\nregistered owner of the Preferred, which shall\nbe the Property Trustee unless and until the\nTrust is dissolved, as the absolute owner of\nthat stock, whether or not any payment for the\nPreferred shall be overdue and despite any\nnotice to the contrary, for any purpose.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar If a Trust is\ndissolved and shares of the Preferred held by\nthe Trust or depositary receipts representing\nthe Preferred are distributed to holders of\nAPEX, we may appoint a transfer agent,\nregistrar, calculation agent, redemption agent\nand dividend disbursement agent for the\nPreferred. The registrar for the Preferred\nwill send notices to shareholders of any\nmeetings at which holders of the Preferred\nhave the right to vote on any matter.\nREPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANTS The following is\na brief description of the terms of the\nreplacement capital covenants. It does not\npurport to be complete in all respects. This\ndescription is subject to and qualified in its\nentirety by reference to the replacement\ncapital covenant, copies of which are\navailable upon request from us as described\nunder \u0093Summary \u0097 Where can I find additional\ninformation?\u0094 We have entered into Replacement\nCapital Covenants (each, a \u0093Replacement\nCapital Covenant\u0094) relating to the APEX and\nthe Preferred. The Replacement Capital\nCovenants only benefit holders of Covered\nDebt, as defined below, and are not\nenforceable by holders of APEX or the\nPreferred. However, the Replacement Capital\nCovenants could preclude us from redeeming or\nrepurchasing the APEX or the Preferred at a\ntime we might otherwise wish to do so. In the\nReplacement Capital Covenants, we covenant not\nto redeem or purchase APEX or shares of the\nPreferred prior to June 1, 2022 (in the case\nof Capital II\u0092s APEX and the Series E) or\nSeptember 4, 2022 (in the case of Capital\nIII\u0092s APEX and the Series F), except in either\ncase to the extent that the applicable\nredemption or purchase price does not exceed:\n                                              \n      133.33% of the aggregate amount of (A)  \n      net cash proceeds that we or our        \n      subsidiaries have received from the     \n      issuance                                \n      and sale of common stock of GS Group    \n      and rights to acquire common stock of   \n      GS Group and (B)\u00a0the market value of    \n      common stock of GS Group that we or     \n      our subsidiaries have delivered or      \n      issued as consideration for property    \n      or assets in an arm\u0092s-length             \n      transaction or in connection with the   \n      conversion of any convertible or        \n      exchangeable securities, other than     \n      securities for which we have received   \n      equity credit from a nationally         \n      recognized rating                       \n      agency, plus                            \n                                              \n38\n                                              \n      100% of the aggregate net cash          \n      proceeds that we or our subsidiaries    \n      have received from the issuance of      \n      certain other                           \n      specified securities that have          \n      equity-like characteristics that        \n      satisfy the requirements of the         \n      Replacement Capital Covenants,          \n                                              \nin each case since October 17, 2012 (without\ncounting any proceeds received more than once\nfor purposes of these limitations). Our\nability to raise proceeds from qualifying\nsecurities will depend on, among other things,\nmarket conditions as well as the acceptability\nto prospective investors of the terms of such\nqualifying securities. Our covenants in the\nReplacement Capital Covenants run in favor of\npersons that buy, hold or sell our\nindebtedness during the period that such\nindebtedness is \u0093Covered Debt,\u0094 which is\ncurrently comprised of our 6.345% Junior\nSubordinated Debentures due February 15, 2034,\nwhich have CUSIP No. 38143VAA7.

The Replacement Capital Covenants\nare subject to various additional terms and\nconditions and this description is subject to\nand qualified in its entirety by reference to\nthe Replacement Capital Covenants, copies of\nwhich are available upon request from us. We\nmay amend or supplement the Replacement\nCapital Covenants with the consent of the\nholders of a majority by principal amount of\nthe debt that at the time of the amendment or\nsupplement is the Covered Debt, provided that\nno such consent shall be required if (i) such\namendment or supplement eliminates common\nstock and rights to acquire common stock as\nreplacement capital securities if, after the\ndate of the Replacement Capital Covenants, an\naccounting standard or interpretive guidance\nof an existing accounting standard issued by\nan organization or regulator that has\nresponsibility for establishing or\ninterpreting accounting standards in the\nUnited States becomes effective such that\nthere is more than an insubstantial risk that\nfailure to eliminate common stock and rights\nto acquire common stock as replacement capital\nsecurities would result in a reduction in our\nearnings per share as calculated in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles\nin the United States, (ii) such amendment or\nsupplement is not adverse to the holders of\nthe Covered Debt, and an officer of GS Group\nhas delivered to the holders of the then-\neffective series of Covered Debt a written\ncertificate stating that, in his or her\ndetermination, such amendment or supplement is\nnot adverse to the holders of the Covered\nDebt, or (iii) the effect of such amendment or\nsupplement is solely to impose additional\nrestrictions on, or eliminate certain of, the\ntypes of securities qualifying as replacement\ncapital securities (other than the securities\ncovered by clause (i) above), and an officer\nof GS Group has delivered to the holders of\nthe then effective series of Covered Debt a\nwritten certificate to that effect. The\nReplacement Capital Covenants may be\nterminated if the holders of at least a\nmajority by principal amount of the Covered\nDebt so agree, or if we no longer have\noutstanding any long-term indebtedness that\nqualifies as Covered Debt, without regard to\nwhether such indebtedness is rated by a\nnationally recognized statistical rating\norganization. In addition, any redemption of\nthe Preferred is subject to prior approval of\nthe Federal Reserve Board. 39\n\nSubject to the limitations described above and\nthe terms of any outstanding debt instruments,\nand, any\npreferred stock ranking senior to the\nPreferred, we or our affiliates may from time\nto time purchase any outstanding APEX by\ntender, in the open market or by private\nagreement.\n\n40\n\nUNITED STATES TAXATION The following\ndiscussion summarizes certain of the material\nU.S. federal income tax consequences of the\npurchase, beneficial ownership and disposition\nof APEX.

These laws are subject to\nchange, possibly on a retroactive basis. The\nauthorities on which this discussion is based\nare subject to various interpretations, and it\nis therefore possible that the federal income\ntax treatment of the purchase, ownership and\ndisposition of APEX may differ from the\ntreatment described below. Please consult your\nown tax advisor concerning the consequences of\nowning the APEX in your particular\ncircumstances under the Internal Revenue Code\nand the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.\n41\n\nClassification of the Trusts\n\nIn the opinion of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, the\nTrusts will not be classified as associations\nor publicly traded partnerships taxable as\ncorporations for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes assuming full compliance with the\nterms of their respective Trust Agreements.\nThe Trusts treat themselves as one or more\ngrantor trusts or agency arrangements. By\npurchasing an APEX, you will agree\nto treat the applicable Trust as one or more\ngrantor trusts or agency arrangements. Under\nthis treatment, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, you will be treated as purchasing\nand owning an undivided beneficial ownership\ninterest in the Preferred,\nand will be required to take into account your\npro rata share of all the items of income,\ngain, loss, or deduction of the applicable\nTrust corresponding to the APEX you own. The\ncharacter of the income included by you as a\nholder of APEX generally\nwill reflect the character of the applicable\nTrust\u0092s income. In addition, upon a sale,\nexchange or other taxable disposition of APEX,\nyou will be treated as having sold, exchanged\nor disposed of your pro rata interest in the\nPreferred, and must\nallocate the proceeds realized from the\ndisposition among such assets in proportion to\ntheir respective fair market values at the\ntime of the disposition.\n\nTaxation of an APEX\n\nEach APEX is treated for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes as an undivided\nbeneficial ownership interest in the\ncorresponding 1/100th interest in a share of\nPreferred. Your aggregate initial U.S. federal\nincome tax basis in your interest in the\nPreferred should equal the purchase\nprice you paid for the APEX.\n\nDistribution on the APEX. Any distribution on\nthe APEX (corresponding to any distribution on\nthe\nPreferred) that we pay out of our current or\naccumulated earnings and profits (as\ndetermined for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes) will constitute a dividend and will\nbe includible in income by you when received\nby the Trust. Any such dividend will\nbe eligible for the dividends-received\ndeduction if you are an otherwise qualifying\ncorporate U.S. holder that meets the holding\nperiod and other requirements for the\ndividends-received deduction. Dividends paid\nto\nnon-corporate U.S. holders are generally\nsubject to a preferential federal income tax\nrate if the holder holds its interest in the\nAPEX for more than 60 days during the\n121-day period beginning 60 days before the\nex-dividend date and meets certain other\nrequirements. Distributions in excess of our\ncurrent and accumulated earnings and\nprofits are treated first as a non-taxable\nreturn of capital to the extent of your basis\nin the APEX, and then as capital gain.\n\nRedemption of Preferred; Disposition of APEX.\nSubject to the discussion below regarding\ncertain redemptions, upon a redemption by us\nof\nthe Preferred or a disposition of APEX\ncorresponding to the Preferred, you generally\nwill recognize capital gain or loss equal to\nthe difference between the amount realized and\nyour adjusted tax basis in your interest in\nthe APEX. Your adjusted tax\nbasis in the APEX at the time of any such\nredemption or disposition should generally\nequal your initial tax basis in the APEX at\nthe time of purchase, reduced by the amount of\nany cash distributions that are not treated as\ndividends, and with\nrespect to corporate holders, by certain\ndistributions treated as \u0093extraordinary\ndividends\u0094. Such capital gain or loss\ngenerally will be long-term capital gain or\nloss if you held the APEX for more than one\nyear. The deductibility of\ncapital losses is subject to limitations.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, an amount paid to\nyou in connection with a redemption of the\nPreferred may\nbe treated as a distribution (taxed in the\nmanner described under \u0093\u0097 Dividends on the\nAPEX\u0094 above) as opposed to an amount realized\non the redemption of the Preferred if,\nimmediately following the redemption, you own\ndirectly or\nindirectly (taking into account applicable\nconstructive ownership rules) shares of any\nother class of our stock. If you own (or are\ndeemed to own) shares of any other class of\nour stock, you should consult your own tax\nadvisor regarding the\nconsequences of receiving a payment in\nconnection with a redemption of the Preferred.\n\n42\n\nDissolution of a Trust\n\nUnder certain circumstances, we may dissolve a\nTrust and distribute the Preferred to the\nholders of APEX. A distribution of Preferred\nto you as a holder\nof APEX upon the dissolution of a Trust will\nnot be a taxable event to you for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, and your tax basis in\nshares of the Preferred received generally\nwill be the same as your tax basis in your\ninterest in the related\nTrust. Your holding period in Preferred\ngenerally would include your holding period in\nthe related APEX.\n\nBackup Withholding Tax and Information\nReporting\n\nIn general, if you are a U.S. holder, we and\nother payors will be required to report the\npayment of dividends on your APEX to the\nInternal\nRevenue Service unless you are a corporation\nor other exempt U.S. holder. Backup\nwithholding will apply to payments of\ndividends to you unless you are an exempt U.S.\nholder or you furnish your taxpayer\nidentification number in the manner prescribed\nin applicable regulations, certify that such\nnumber is correct, certify as to no loss of\nexemption from backup withholding and meet\ncertain other conditions.\n\nIn general, payment of the proceeds from the\ndisposition of APEX to or through the U.S.\noffice of a broker is subject to information\nreporting and\nbackup withholding unless you establish an\nexemption from information reporting and\nbackup withholding. Payment of the proceeds\nfrom the disposition of APEX effected at a\nforeign office of a broker will not be subject\nto information reporting or\nback withholding. However, a sale effected at\na foreign office of a broker could be subject\nto information reporting in the same manner as\na sale within the United States (and in\ncertain cases may be subject to backup\nwithholding as well) if\n(i) the broker has certain connections to the\nUnited States, (ii) the proceeds or\nconfirmation are sent to the United States or\n(iii) the sale has certain other specified\nconnections with the United States.\n\nYou generally may obtain a refund of any\namounts withheld under the backup withholding\nrules that exceed your income tax liability by\nfiling a refund\nclaim with the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nForeign Account Tax Compliance\n\nA U.S. law enacted in 2010 (commonly known as\n\u0093FATCA\u0094) could impose a withholding tax of 30%\non dividend income and other periodic payments\non\nAPEX paid to you or any non-U.S. person or\nentity that receives such income (a \u0093non-U.S.\npayee\u0094) on your behalf, unless you and each\nsuch non-U.S. payee in the payment chain\ncomply with the applicable information\nreporting, account identification,\nwithholding, certification and other FATCA-\nrelated requirements. In the case of a payee\nthat is a non-U.S. financial institution (for\nexample, a clearing system, custodian, nominee\nor broker), withholding generally will not be\nimposed if the financial institution complies\nwith the requirements imposed by FATCA\nto collect and report (to the U.S. or another\nrelevant taxing authority) substantial\ninformation regarding such institution\u0092s U.S.\naccount holders (which would include some\naccount holders that are\nnon-U.S. entities but have U.S. owners). Other\npayees, including individuals, may be required\nto provide proof of tax residence or waivers\nof confidentiality laws and/or, in the case of\nnon-U.S. entities, certification or\ninformation relating to their U.S. ownership.\n\nWithholding may be imposed at\nany point in a chain of payments if the payee\nis not compliant. A chain may work as follows,\nfor example: The payment is transferred\nthrough a paying agent to a clearing system,\nthe clearing system makes a payment to each of\nthe clearing\nsystem\u0092s participants, and finally the\nclearing system participant makes a payment to\na non-U.S. bank or broker through which you\nhold the APEX, who credits the payment to your\naccount.\n\nAccordingly, if you receive payments through a\nchain that includes one or more non-U.S.\npayees, such as a non-U.S. bank or broker, the\npayment could be subject to withholding if,\nfor example, your\n\n43\n\nnon-U.S. bank or broker through which you hold\nthe APEX fails to comply with the FATCA\nrequirements and is subject to withholding.\nThis would be the case\neven if you would not otherwise have been\ndirectly subject to withholding.\n\nA number of countries have entered into, and\nother countries are\nexpected to enter into, agreements with the\nU.S. to facilitate the type of information\nreporting required under FATCA. While the\nexistence of such agreements will not\neliminate the risk that APEX will be subject\nto the withholding described above,\nthese agreements are expected to reduce the\nrisk of the withholding for investors in (or\ninvestors that indirectly hold APEX through\nfinancial institutions in) those countries.\n\nThe withholding tax described above could\napply to all dividends on the APEX. We will\nnot pay any additional amounts in respect of\nthis withholding tax,\nso if this withholding applies, you will\nreceive less than the amount that you would\nhave otherwise received.\n\nDepending on your circumstances, you\nmay be entitled to a refund or credit in\nrespect of some or all of this withholding.\nHowever, even if you are entitled to have any\nsuch withholding refunded, the required\nprocedures could be cumbersome and\nsignificantly delay your receipt of any\nwithheld amounts. You should consult your own\ntax advisors regarding FATCA. You should also\nconsult your bank or broker through which you\nwould hold the APEX about the likelihood that\npayments to it (for credit to you) may become\nsubject to\nwithholding in the payment chain.\n\nLEGAL OWNERSHIP AND BOOK-ENTRY ISSUANCE\n\nPlease note that in this prospectus,\nreferences to \u0093holders\u0094 mean those who own\nsecurities registered in their own names, on\nthe books that we\nor the depositary maintain for this purpose,\nand not indirect holders who own beneficial\ninterests in depositary shares registered in\nstreet name or issued in book-entry form\nthrough The Depositary Trust Company.\n\nThe Depository Trust Company, which we refer\nto along with its successors in this capacity\nas \u0093DTC,\u0094 acts as securities depositary for\nthe\nAPEX. The APEX are issued only as fully\nregistered securities registered in the name\nof Cede & Co. (DTC\u0092s partnership nominee) or\nsuch other name as may be requested by an\nauthorized representative of DTC.

None of us, a Trust,\nthe trustees of a Trust, any registrar and\ntransfer agent, any paying agent or any agent\nof any of us or them, has any responsibility\nor liability for any\naspect of DTC\u0092s or any participant\u0092s records\nrelating to, or for payments made on account\nof, beneficial interests in a global security,\nor for maintaining, supervising or reviewing\nany records relating to such beneficial\ninterests.\n\nBelow, we describe special considerations that\napply to registered securities issued in\nglobal \u0097 i.e., book-entry \u0097 form. First we\ndescribe the difference between legal\nownership and indirect ownership of registered\nsecurities. Then we describe special\nprovisions that apply to global securities.\n\nWho Is the Legal Owner of a Registered\nSecurity?\n\nEach APEX is represented either by a\ncertificate issued in definitive form to a\nparticular investor or by one or more global\nsecurities representing the\nentire issuance of APEX. We refer to those who\nhave APEX registered in their own names, on\nthe books that we or the trustee maintain for\nthis purpose, as the \u0093holders\u0094 of those APEX.\nThese persons are the legal holders of the\nAPEX. We\nrefer to those who, indirectly through others,\nown beneficial interests in APEX that are not\nregistered in their own names as indirect\nowners of those APEX. As we discuss below,\nindirect owners are not legal holders, and\ninvestors in APEX issued in\nbook-entry form or in street name are indirect\nowners.\n\nBook-Entry Owners\n\nThe APEX are issued in book-entry form only.\nThis means APEX are represented by one or more\nglobal securities registered in the name of a\nfinancial\ninstitution that holds them as depositary on\nbehalf of other financial institutions that\nparticipate in the depositary\u0092s book-entry\nsystem. These participating institutions, in\nturn, hold beneficial interests in the APEX on\nbehalf of themselves\nor their customers.\n\nFor APEX issued in global form, the relevant\nTrust recognizes only the depositary as the\nholder of the APEX and the Trust makes\nall payments on the APEX to the depositary.\nThe depositary passes along the payments it\nreceives to its participants, which in turn\npass the payments along to their customers who\nare the beneficial owners. The depositary and\nits participants do so\nunder agreements they have made with one\nanother or with their customers; they are not\nobligated to do so under the terms of the\nAPEX.\n\nAs a result,\ninvestors do not own APEX directly. Instead,\nthey own beneficial interests in a global\nsecurity, through a bank, broker or other\nfinancial institution that participates in the\ndepositary\u0092s book-entry system or holds an\ninterest through a\nparticipant. As long as the APEX are issued in\nglobal form, investors are indirect owners,\nand not holders, of the securities.\n\n45\n\nStreet Name Owners In the future a Trust may\nterminate a global security and issue APEX in\nnon-globalform. In that case, investors may\nchoose to hold their APEX in their own names\nor in street name. APEX held by an investor in\nstreet name would be registered in the name of\na bank, broker or other financial institution\nthat the investor chooses, and the investor\nwould hold only a beneficial interest in those\nAPEX through an account he or she maintains at\nthat institution. For APEX held in street\nname, the relevant Trust will recognize only\nthe intermediary banks, brokers and other\nfinancial institutions in whose names the APEX\nare registered as the holders of those APEX\nand the Trust will make all payments on those\nAPEX to them. These institutions pass along\nthe payments they receive to their customers\nwho are the beneficial owners, but only\nbecause they agree to do so in their customer\nagreements or because they are legally\nrequired to do so. Investors who hold APEX in\nstreet name will be indirect owners, not\nholders, of those APEX. Legal Holders Our\nobligations, the obligations of the Trusts, as\nwell as the obligations of the trustees under\nthe Trust Agreements and any other third\nparties employed by us or the trustees, run\nonly to the holders of the APEX. Neither we\nnor the Trusts have obligations to investors\nwho hold beneficial interests in global\nsecurities, in street name or by any other\nindirect means. This will be the case whether\nan investor chooses to be an indirect owner of\na APEX or has no choice because the relevant\nTrust is issuing the APEX only in global form.\nFor example, once a Trust makes a payment or\ngives a notice to the holder, the Trust has no\nfurther responsibility for that payment or\nnotice even if that holder is required, under\nagreements with depositary participants or\ncustomers or by law, to pass it along to the\nindirect owners but does not do so. Similarly,\nif the Trust wants to obtain the approval of\nthe holders for any purpose \u0097 e.g., to amend\nthe amended and restated trust declaration or\nto relieve us of the consequences of a default\nor of our obligation to comply with a\nparticular provision of the indenture \u0097 the\nTrust would seek the approval only from the\nholders, and not the indirect owners, of the\nAPEX. Whether and how the holders contact the\nindirect owners is up to the holders. Special\nConsiderations for Indirect Owners If you hold\nAPEX through a bank, broker or other financial\ninstitution, either in book-entry form or in\nstreet name, you should check with your own\ninstitution to find out:\n                                              \n      how it handles securities payments and  \n      notices;                                \n                                              \n                                           \n      whether it imposes fees or charges;  \n                                           \n                                              \n      how it would handle a request for the   \n      holders\u0092 consent, if ever required;      \n                                              \n                                              \n      whether and how you can instruct it to  \n      send you APEX registered in your own    \n      name so you can be a holder, if that    \n      is                                      \n      permitted in the future;                \n                                              \n                                              \n      how it would exercise rights under the  \n      APEX if there were a default or other   \n      event triggering the need for holders   \n      to act                                  \n      to protect their interests; and         \n                                              \n                                              \n      if the APEX are in book-entry form,     \n      how the depositary\u0092s rules and           \n      procedures will affect these matters.   \n                                              \nWhat Is a Global Security? The APEX are issued\nin book-entry form only. Each APEX issued in\nbook-entry form are represented by a global\nsecurity that the relevant Trust deposits with\nand registers in the name of one 46\n\nor more financial institutions or clearing\nsystems, or their nominees, which we select. A\nfinancial institution or clearing system that\nthe Trust selects for any APEX for this\npurpose is called the \u0093depositary\u0094 for that\nAPEX. The initial depositary is The Depository\nTrust Company, New York, New York, which is\nknown as \u0093DTC.\u0094 Investors may also hold\nbeneficial interests in a global security\nthrough Euroclear Bank SA/NV, which is known\nas \u0093Euroclear\u0094 or Clearstream Banking, soci\u00e9t\u00e9\nanonyme, which is known as \u0093Clearstream,\u0094 as\nDTC participants. A global security may not be\ntransferred to or registered in the name of\nanyone other than the depositary or its\nnominee, unless special termination situations\narise. We describe those situations below\nunder \u0093\u0097 Special Situations When a Global\nSecurity Will Be Terminated.\u0094 If termination\noccurs, the relevant Trust may issue the APEX\nthrough another book-entry clearing system or\nthe APEX may no longer be held through any\nbook-entry clearing system. The depositary, or\nits nominee, is the sole registered owner and\nholder of all APEX represented by a global\nsecurity, and investors are permitted to own\nonly indirect interests in a global security.\nIndirect interests must be held by means of an\naccount with a broker, bank or other financial\ninstitution that in turn has an account with\nthe depositary or with another institution\nthat does. Thus, an investor whose APEX is\nrepresented by a global security is not a\nholder of the APEX, but only an indirect owner\nof an interest in the global security. Special\nConsiderations for Global Securities As an\nindirect owner, an investor\u0092s rights relating\nto a global security are governed by the\naccount rules of the depositary and those of\nthe investor\u0092s financial institution or other\nintermediary through which it holds its\ninterest ( e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream, if\nDTC is the depositary), as well as general\nlaws relating to securities transfers. The\nTrusts do not recognize this type of investor\nor any intermediary as a holder of APEX and\ninstead deal only with the depositary that\nholds the global security. Because the APEX\nare issued only in the form of a global\nsecurity, an investor should be aware of the\nfollowing:\n                                              \n      An investor cannot cause the APEX to    \n      be registered in his or her own name,   \n      and cannot obtain                       \n      non-global certificates for his or her  \n      interest in the APEX, except in the     \n      special situations we describe below;   \n                                              \n                                              \n      An investor is an indirect holder and   \n      must look to his or her own bank or     \n      broker for payments on the APEX and     \n      protection of                           \n      his or her legal rights relating to     \n      the APEX, as we describe above under    \n      \u0093\u0097Who Is the Legal Owner of a Registered  \n      Security?\u0094;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      An investor may not be able to sell     \n      interests in the APEX to some           \n      insurance companies and other           \n      institutions that are                   \n      required by law to own securities in    \n      non-book-entry form;                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      An investor may not be able to pledge   \n      his or her interest in a global         \n      security in circumstances where         \n      certificates                            \n      representing the APEX must be           \n      delivered to the lender or other        \n      beneficiary of the pledge in order for  \n      the pledge to be effective;             \n                                              \n                                              \n      The depositary\u0092s policies govern         \n      payments, deliveries, transfers,        \n      exchanges, notices and other matters    \n      relating to an                          \n      investor\u0092s interest in a global          \n      security, and those policies may        \n      change from time to time. We, the       \n      Trusts and the trustees have no         \n      responsibility for any aspect of the    \n      depositary\u0092s policies, actions or        \n      records of ownership interests in a     \n      global security. We, the Trusts and     \n      the trustees also do not supervise the  \n      depositary in any way;                  \n                                              \n47\n                                              \n      The depositary requires that those who  \n      purchase and sell interests in a        \n      global security within its book-entry   \n      system use                              \n      immediately available funds and your    \n      broker or bank may require you to do    \n      so as well; and                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      Financial institutions that             \n      participate in the depositary\u0092s          \n      book-entry system and through which an  \n      investor holds its                      \n      interest in the global securities,      \n      directly or indirectly, may also have   \n      their own policies affecting payments,  \n      deliveries, transfers, exchanges,       \n      notices and other matters relating to   \n      the global securities, and those        \n      policies may change from time to        \n      time. For example, if you hold an       \n      interest in a global security through   \n      Euroclear or Clearstream, when DTC is   \n      the depositary, Euroclear or            \n      Clearstream, as applicable, requires    \n      those who purchase and sell interests   \n      in that global security through         \n      them to use immediately available       \n      funds and comply with other policies    \n      and procedures, including deadlines     \n      for giving instructions as to           \n      transactions that are to be effected    \n      on a particular day. There may be more  \n      than one financial intermediary in      \n      the chain of ownership for an           \n      investor. The Trusts do not monitor     \n      and are not responsible for the         \n      policies or actions or records of       \n      ownership interests of any of those     \n      intermediaries.                         \n                                              \nSpecial Situations When a Global Security Will\nBe Terminated In a few special situations\ndescribed below, a global security will be\nterminated and interests in it will be\nexchanged for certificates in non-globalform\nrepresenting the APEX it represented. After\nthat exchange, the choice of whether to hold\nthe APEX directly or in street name will be up\nto the investor. Investors must consult their\nown banks or brokers to find out how to have\ntheir interests in a global security\ntransferred on termination to their own names,\nso that they will be holders. We have\ndescribed the rights of holders and street\nname investors above under \u0093\u0097 Who Is the Legal\nOwner of a Registered Security?\u0094 The special\nsituations for termination of a global\nsecurity are as follows:\n                                              \n      if the depositary notifies us and the   \n      Trust that it is unwilling, unable or   \n      no longer qualified to continue as      \n      depositary                              \n      for that global security and we do not  \n      appoint another institution to act as   \n      depositary within 60 days;              \n                                              \n                                              \n      if we notify the depositary that we     \n      wish to terminate that global security  \n      and we do not appoint another           \n      institution to act                      \n      as depositary within 60 days; or        \n                                              \n                                              \n      if an event of default has occurred     \n      with regard to the corresponding        \n      subordinated debt securities under the  \n      indenture and                           \n      has not been cured or waived.           \n                                              \nDTC\u0092s current rules\nprovide that it would\nnotify its\nparticipants of a\nrequest by us or the\nTrust to terminate a\nglobal security, but\nwill only withdraw\nbeneficial interests\nfrom the global\nsecurity at the\nrequest of each DTC\nparticipant. If a\nglobal security is\nterminated, only the\ndepositary, and not\nwe, the Trust or the\ntrustees is\nresponsible for\ndeciding the names of\nthe institutions in\nwhose names the APEX\nrepresented by the\nglobal security will\nbe registered and,\ntherefore, who will be\nthe holders of those\nAPEX. Considerations\nRelating to Euroclear\nand Clearstream\nEuroclear and\nClearstream are\nsecurities clearing\nsystems in Europe.\nBoth systems clear and\nsettle securities\ntransactions between\ntheir participants\nthrough electronic,\nbook-entry delivery of\nsecurities against\npayment. Euroclear and\nClearstream may be\ndepositaries for a\nglobal security. In\naddition, Euroclear\nand Clearstream may\nhold interests in a\nglobal security as\nparticipants in DTC.\n48\n\nAs long as any global\nsecurity is held by\nEuroclear or\nClearstream as\ndepositary, you may\nhold an\ninterest in the global\nsecurity only through\nan organization that\nparticipates, directly\nor indirectly, in\nEuroclear or\nClearstream. If\nEuroclear or\nClearstream is the\ndepositary for a\nglobal security and\nthere is no depositary\nin the United States,\nyou will not be able\nto hold interests in\nthat global security\nthrough any securities\nclearance system in\nthe United States.\n\nPayments, deliveries,\ntransfers, exchanges,\nnotices and other\nmatters relating to\nthe APEX made through\nEuroclear or\nClearstream must\ncomply with the rules\nand procedures of\nthose systems. Those\nclearing systems could\nchange their rules and\nprocedures at any\ntime.\nNeither we nor the\nTrust have control\nover those systems or\ntheir participants,\nand neither we nor the\nTrust take\nresponsibility for\ntheir activities.\nTransactions between\nparticipants in\nEuroclear or\nClearstream, on one\nhand, and participants\nin\nDTC, on the other\nhand, when DTC is the\ndepositary, would also\nbe subject to DTC\u0092s\nrules and procedures.\n\nSpecial Timing\nConsiderations for\nTransactions in\nEuroclear and\nClearstream\n\nInvestors are able to\nmake and receive\nthrough Euroclear and\nClearstream payments,\ndeliveries, transfers,\nexchanges, notices and\nother transactions\ninvolving any APEX\nheld through those\nclearing systems only\non days when those\nsystems are open for\nbusiness. Those\nclearing systems may\nnot be open for\nbusiness on days when\nbanks, brokers and\nother\ninstitutions are open\nfor business in the\nUnited States.\n\nIn addition, because\nof time-zone\ndifferences, U.S.\ninvestors who hold\ntheir interests in\nthe APEX through these\nclearing systems and\nwish to transfer their\ninterests, or to\nreceive or make a\npayment or delivery or\nexercise any other\nright with respect to\ntheir interests, on a\nparticular day may\nfind that the\ntransaction will not\nbe\neffected until the\nnext business day in\nLuxembourg or\nBrussels, as\napplicable. Thus,\ninvestors who wish to\nexercise rights that\nexpire on a particular\nday may need to act\nbefore the expiration\ndate. In addition,\ninvestors who hold\ntheir interests\nthrough both DTC and\nEuroclear or\nClearstream may need\nto make special\narrangements to\nfinance any purchases\nor sales of their\ninterests between the\nU.S. and European\nclearing systems, and\nthose transactions may\nsettle later than\nwould be the case\nfor transactions\nwithin one clearing\nsystem.\n\n49\n\nINDEPENDENT REGISTERED\nPUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nThe financial\nstatements and\nmanagement\u0092s\nassessment of the\neffectiveness of\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting\n(which is included in\nManagement\u0092s Report on\nInternal Control over\nFinancial Reporting)\nof The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc.\nincorporated in this\nprospectus by\nreference to the\nAnnual Report on Form\n10-K of The Goldman\nSachs\nGroup, Inc. for the\nyear ended December\n31, 2020 have been so\nincorporated in\nreliance on the report\nof\nPricewaterhouseCoopers\nLLP, an independent\nregistered public\naccounting firm, given\non the authority of\nsaid firm as experts\nin auditing and\naccounting.\n\n50\n\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT\nPURSUANT TO THE\nPRIVATE\n\nSECURITIES LITIGATION\nREFORM ACT OF 1995\n\nWe\nhave included or\nincorporated by\nreference in this\nprospectus statements\nthat may constitute\n\u0093forward-looking\nstatements\u0094 within the\nmeaning of the safe\nharbor provisions of\nThe Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act\nof 1995.

The statute provides that it is not\nexclusive of other rights to which those\nseeking indemnification may be entitled under\nany by-law,agreement, vote of stockholders or\ndisinterested directors or otherwise. Section\n6.4 of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s by-\nlawsprovides for indemnification by The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. of any person who is\nor was a director or an officer appointed by\nresolution of the board of directors of The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., or is or was a\nmember of the Shareholders\u0092 Committee acting\npursuant to the Amended and Restated\nShareholders\u0092 Agreement (as described in\nExhibit 10.6 to the Annual Report on Form\n10-Kof The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2014). The by-\nlawsalso provide that The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. shall advance expenses to any such person\nand, if reimbursement of such expenses is\ndemanded in advance of the final disposition\nof the matter with respect to which such\ndemand is being made, upon receipt of an\nundertaking by or on behalf of such director\nor officer to repay such amount if it is\nultimately determined that the director or\nofficer is not entitled to be indemnified by\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. To the extent\nauthorized from time to time by the board of\ndirectors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\n(including a resolution authorizing officers\nof The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. to grant such\nrights), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. may\nprovide to any one or more persons, including\nwithout limitation any one or more employees\nor other agents of The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc., or one or more directors, officers,\nemployees and other agents of any subsidiary\nor any other enterprise, rights of\nindemnification and to receive payment or\nreimbursement of expenses, including\nattorneys\u0092 fees, with any such rights subject\nto the terms, conditions and limitations\nestablished pursuant to a resolution by the\nboard of directors of The Goldman Sachs Group,\nInc. The by-lawsdo not limit the power of The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. or its board of\ndirectors to provide other indemnification and\nexpense reimbursement rights to directors,\nofficers, employees, agents and other persons\notherwise than pursuant to the by-laws. II-1\n\nSection 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law permits a corporation to\nprovide in its certificate of incorporation\nthat a director of the corporation shall not\nbe personally liable to the corporation or its\nstockholders for monetary damages for breach\nof fiduciary duty as a director, except for\nliability for (i) any breach of the director\u0092s\nduty of loyalty to the corporation or its\nstockholders, (ii) acts or omissions not in\ngood faith or which involve intentional\nmisconduct or a knowing violation of law,\n(iii) payments of unlawful dividends or\nunlawful stock purchases or redemptions, or\n(iv) any transaction from which the director\nderived an improper personal benefit. Both The\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u0092s restated\ncertificate of incorporation and GS Finance\nCorp.\u0092s certificate of incorporation provide\nfor such limitation of liability. Policies of\ninsurance are maintained by The Goldman Sachs\nGroup, Inc. under which its directors and\nofficers and those of GS Finance Corp. are\ninsured, within the limits and subject to the\nlimitations of the policies, against certain\nexpenses in connection with the defense of,\nand certain liabilities which might be imposed\nas a result of, actions, suits or proceedings\nto which they are parties by reason of being\nor having been such directors or officers.

Insofar as indemnification for\nliabilities arising under the Securities Act\nof 1933 may be permitted to directors,\nofficers and controlling persons of a\nRegistrant pursuant to the foregoing\nprovisions, or otherwise, such Registrant has\nbeen advised that in the opinion of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission such\nindemnification is against public policy as\nexpressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and\nis, therefore, unenforceable. In the event\nthat a claim for indemnification against such\nliabilities (other than the payment by a\nRegistrant of expenses incurred or paid by a\ndirector, officer or controlling person of a\nRegistrant in the successful defense of any\naction, suit or proceeding) is asserted by\nsuch director, officer or controlling person\nin connection with the securities being\nregistered, such Registrant will, unless in\nthe opinion of its counsel the matter has been\nsettled by controlling precedent, submit to a\ncourt of appropriate jurisdiction the question\nwhether such indemnification by it is against\npublic policy as expressed in the Securities\nAct of 1933 and will be governed by the final\nadjudication of such issue.
