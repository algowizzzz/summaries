AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nConsolidation The firm consolidates entities\nin which the firm has a controlling financial\ninterest. The firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by\nfirst evaluating whether the entity is a\nvoting interest entity or a variable interest\nentity (VIE). Voting Interest Entities. Voting\ninterest entities are entities in which (i)\nthe total equity investment at risk is\nsufficient to enable the entity to finance its\nactivities independently and (ii) the equity\nholders have the power to direct the\nactivities of the entity that most\nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nthe obligation to absorb the losses of the\nentity and the right to receive the residual\nreturns of the entity. The usual condition for\na controlling financial interest in a voting\ninterest entity is ownership of a majority\nvoting interest. If the firm has a controlling\nmajority voting interest in a voting interest\nentity, the entity is consolidated. Variable\nInterest Entities. A VIE is an entity that\nlacks one or more of the characteristics of a\nvoting interest entity. The firm has a\ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE when\nthe firm has a variable interest or interests\nthat provide it with (i) the power to direct\nthe activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance and (ii) the obligation to absorb\nlosses of the VIE or the right to receive\nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially\nbe significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for\nfurther information about VIEs. Equity-Method\nInvestments. When the firm does not have a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity\nbut can exert significant influence over the\nentity\u2019s operating and financial policies, the\ninvestment is generally accounted for at fair\nvalue by electing the fair value option\navailable under U.S. GAAP. Significant\ninfluence generally exists when the firm owns\n20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock or in-\nsubstance common stock. In certain cases, the\nfirm applies the equity method of accounting\nto new investments that are strategic in\nnature or closely related to the firm\u2019s\nprincipal business activities, when the firm\nhas a significant degree of involvement in the\ncash flows or operations of the investee or\nwhen cost-benefit considerations are less\nsignificant. See Note 8 for further\ninformation about equity-method investments.\nInvestment Funds. The firm has formed\ninvestment funds with third-party investors.\nThese funds are typically organized as limited\npartnerships or limited liability companies\nfor which the firm acts as general partner or\nmanager. Generally, the firm does not hold a\nmajority of the economic interests in these\nfunds. These funds are usually voting interest\nentities and generally are not consolidated\nbecause third-party investors typically have\nrights to terminate the funds or to remove the\nfirm as general partner or manager.\nInvestments in these funds are generally\nmeasured at net asset value (NAV) and are\nincluded in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and\n22 for further information about investments\nin funds. Use of Estimates Preparation of\nthese consolidated financial statements\nrequires management to make certain estimates\nand assumptions, the most important of which\nrelate to fair value measurements, the\nallowance for credit losses on loans and\nlending commitments accounted for at amortized\ncost, discretionary compensation accruals,\naccounting for goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets, provisions for losses that\nmay arise from litigation and regulatory\nproceedings (including governmental\ninvestigations), and accounting for income\ntaxes. These estimates and assumptions are\nbased on the best available information, but\nactual results could be materially different.\nRevenue Recognition Financial Assets and\nLiabilities at Fair Value. Trading assets and\nliabilities and certain investments are\ncarried at fair value either under the fair\nvalue option or in accordance with other U.S.\nGAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to\naccount for certain of its loans and other\nfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value\nby electing the fair value option. The fair\nvalue of a financial instrument is the amount\nthat would be received to sell an asset or\npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Financial assets are marked\nto bid prices and financial liabilities are\nmarked to offer prices. Fair value\nmeasurements do not include transaction costs.\nFair value gains or losses are generally\nincluded in market making or other principal\ntransactions. See Note 4 for further\ninformation about fair value measurements.\n                                          \n  7    Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                          \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nRevenue from Contracts with Clients. The firm\nrecognizes revenue earned from contracts with\nclients for services, such as investment\nbanking, investment management, and execution\nand clearing (contracts with clients), when\nthe performance obligations related to the\nunderlying transaction are completed. Revenues\nfrom contracts with clients represent\napproximately 45% of total non-interest\nrevenues (including approximately 85% of\ninvestment banking revenues, approximately 95%\nof investment management revenues and all\ncommissions and fees) for each of the three\nand six months ended June 2023 and June 2022.\nSee Note 25 for information about net revenues\nby business segment. Investment Banking\nAdvisory. Fees from financial advisory\nassignments are recognized in revenues when\nthe services related to the underlying\ntransaction are completed under the terms of\nthe assignment. Non-refundable deposits and\nmilestone payments in connection with\nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized\nin revenues upon completion of the underlying\ntransaction or when the assignment is\notherwise concluded. Expenses associated with\nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized\nwhen incurred and are included in transaction\nbased expenses. Client reimbursements for such\nexpenses are included in investment banking\nrevenues. Underwriting. Fees from underwriting\nassignments are recognized in revenues upon\ncompletion of the underlying transaction based\non the terms of the assignment. Expenses\nassociated with underwriting assignments are\ngenerally deferred until the related revenue\nis recognized or the assignment is otherwise\nconcluded. Such expenses are included in\ntransaction based expenses for completed\nassignments. Investment Management The firm\nearns management fees and incentive fees for\ninvestment management services, which are\nincluded in investment management revenues.\nThe firm makes payments to brokers and\nadvisors related to the placement of the\nfirm\u2019s investment funds (distribution fees),\nwhich are included in transaction based\nexpenses. Management Fees. Management fees for\nmutual funds are calculated as a percentage of\ndaily net asset value and are received\nmonthly. Management fees for hedge funds and\nseparately managed accounts are calculated as\na percentage of month-end net asset value and\nare generally received quarterly. Management\nfees for private equity funds are calculated\nas a percentage of monthly invested capital or\ncommitted capital and are received quarterly,\nsemi-annually or annually, depending on the\nfund. Management fees are recognized over time\nin the period the services are provided.\nDistribution fees paid by the firm are\ncalculated based on either a percentage of the\nmanagement fee, the investment fund\u2019s net\nasset value or the committed capital. Such\nfees are included in transaction based\nexpenses. Incentive Fees. Incentive fees are\ncalculated as a percentage of a fund\u2019s or\nseparately managed account\u2019s return, or excess\nreturn above a specified benchmark or other\nperformance target. Incentive fees are\ngenerally based on investment performance over\na twelve-month period or over the life of a\nfund. Fees that are based on performance over\na twelve-month period are subject to\nadjustment prior to the end of the measurement\nperiod. For fees that are based on investment\nperformance over the life of the fund, future\ninvestment underperformance may require fees\npreviously distributed to the firm to be\nreturned to the fund. Incentive fees earned\nfrom a fund or separately managed account are\nrecognized when it is probable that a\nsignificant reversal of such fees will not\noccur, which is generally when such fees are\nno longer subject to fluctuations in the\nmarket value of investments held by the fund\nor separately managed account. Therefore,\nincentive fees recognized during the period\nmay relate to performance obligations\nsatisfied in previous periods.\n                                          \n  Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q    8  \n                                          \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nCommissions and Fees The firm earns\nsubstantially all commissions and fees from\nexecuting and clearing client transactions on\nstock, options and futures markets, as well as\nover-the-counter (OTC) transactions.\nCommissions and fees are recognized on the day\nthe trade is executed. The firm also provides\nthird-party research services to clients in\nconnection with certain soft-dollar\narrangements. Third-party research costs\nincurred by the firm in connection with such\narrangements are presented net within\ncommissions and fees. Remaining Performance\nObligations Remaining performance obligations\nare services that the firm has committed to\nperform in the future in connection with its\ncontracts with clients. The firm\u2019s remaining\nperformance obligations are generally related\nto its financial advisory assignments and\ncertain investment management activities.\nRevenues associated with remaining performance\nobligations relating to financial advisory\nassignments cannot be determined until the\noutcome of the transaction. For the firm\u2019s\ninvestment management activities, where fees\nare calculated based on the net asset value of\nthe fund or separately managed account, future\nrevenues associated with such remaining\nperformance obligations cannot be determined\nas such fees are subject to fluctuations in\nthe market value of investments held by the\nfund or separately managed account. The firm\nis able to determine the future revenues\nassociated with management fees calculated\nbased on committed capital. As of June 2023,\nsubstantially all future net revenues\nassociated with such remaining performance\nobligations will be recognized through 2031.\nAnnual revenues associated with such\nperformance obligations average less than $\n300million through 2031. Transfers of\nFinancial Assets Transfers of financial assets\nare accounted for as sales when the firm has\nrelinquished control over the assets\ntransferred. For transfers of financial assets\naccounted for as sales, any gains or losses\nare recognized in net revenues. Assets or\nliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s\ncontinuing involvement with transferred\nfinancial assets are initially recognized at\nfair value. For transfers of financial assets\nthat are not accounted for as sales, the\nassets are generally included in trading\nassets and the transfer is accounted for as a\ncollateralized financing, with the related\ninterest expense recognized over the life of\nthe transaction. See Note 11 for further\ninformation about transfers of financial\nassets accounted for as collateralized\nfinancings and Note 16 for further information\nabout transfers of financial assets accounted\nfor as sales. Cash and Cash Equivalents The\nfirm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid\novernight deposits held in the ordinary course\nof business. Cash and cash equivalents\nincluded cash and due from banks of $\n8.65billion as of June 2023 and $ 7.87billion\nas of December 2022. Cash and cash equivalents\nalso included interest-bearing deposits with\nbanks of $ 262.28billion as of June 2023 and $\n233.96billion as of December 2022. The firm\nsegregates cash for regulatory and other\npurposes related to client activity. Cash and\ncash equivalents segregated for regulatory and\nother purposes were $ 14.84billion as of June\n2023 and $ 16.94billion as of December 2022.\nIn addition, the firm segregates securities\nfor regulatory and other purposes related to\nclient activity. See Note 11 for further\ninformation about segregated securities.\nCustomer and Other Receivables Customer and\nother receivables included receivables from\ncustomers and counterparties of $ 78.30billion\nas of June 2023 and $ 67.88billion as of\nDecember 2022, and receivables from brokers,\ndealers and clearing organizations of $\n78.98billion as of June 2023 and $\n67.57billion as of December 2022. Such\nreceivables primarily consist of collateral\nposted in connection with certain derivative\ntransactions, customer margin loans and\nreceivables resulting from unsettled\ntransactions. Substantially all of these\nreceivables are accounted for at amortized\ncost net of any allowance for credit losses,\nwhich generally approximates fair value. As\nthese receivables are not accounted for at\nfair value, they are not included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5.\nHad these receivables been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, substantially all\nwould have been classified in level 2 as of\nboth June 2023 and December 2022. See Note 10\nfor further information about customer and\nother receivables accounted for at fair value\nunder the fair value option. Interest on\ncustomer and other receivables is recognized\nover the life of the transaction and included\nin interest income. Customer and other\nreceivables includes receivables from\ncontracts with clients and contract assets.\nContract assets represent the firm\u2019s right to\nreceive consideration for services provided in\nconnection with its contracts with clients for\nwhich collection is conditional and not merely\nsubject to the passage of time. The firm\u2019s\nreceivables from contracts with clients were $\n3.43billion as of June 2023 and $ 3.01billion\nas of December 2022. As of both June 2023 and\nDecember 2022, contract assets were not\nmaterial.\n                                          \n  9    Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                          \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Customer and other\npayables are accounted for at cost plus\naccrued interest, which generally approximates\nfair value. As these payables are not\naccounted for at fair value, they are not\nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in\nNotes 4 and 5. Had these payables been\nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy,\nsubstantially all would have been classified\nin level 2 as of both June 2023 and December\n2022. Interest on customer and other payables\nis recognized over the life of the transaction\nand included in interest expense. Offsetting\nAssets and Liabilities To reduce credit\nexposures on derivatives and securities\nfinancing transactions, the firm may enter\ninto master netting agreements or similar\narrangements (collectively, netting\nagreements) with counterparties that permit it\nto offset receivables and payables with such\ncounterparties. A netting agreement is a\ncontract with a counterparty that permits net\nsettlement of multiple transactions with that\ncounterparty, including upon the exercise of\ntermination rights by a non-defaulting party.\nUpon exercise of such termination rights, all\ntransactions governed by the netting agreement\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is\ncalculated. In addition, the firm receives and\nposts cash and securities collateral with\nrespect to its derivatives and securities\nfinancing transactions, subject to the terms\nof the related credit support agreements or\nsimilar arrangements (collectively, credit\nsupport agreements). An enforceable credit\nsupport agreement grants the non-defaulting\nparty exercising termination rights the right\nto liquidate the collateral and apply the\nproceeds to any amounts owed. In order to\nassess enforceability of the firm\u2019s right of\nsetoff under netting and credit support\nagreements, the firm evaluates various\nfactors, including applicable bankruptcy laws,\nlocal statutes and regulatory provisions in\nthe jurisdiction of the parties to the\nagreement. Derivatives are reported on a net-\nby-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable\nor receivable for derivative assets and\nliabilities for a given counterparty) in the\nconsolidated balance sheets when a legal right\nof setoff exists under an enforceable netting\nagreement. Resale agreements and securities\nsold under agreements to repurchase\n(repurchase agreements) and securities\nborrowed and loaned transactions with the same\nsettlement date are presented on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis in the consolidated balance\nsheets when such transactions meet certain\nsettlement criteria and are subject to netting\nagreements. In the consolidated balance\nsheets, derivatives are reported net of cash\ncollateral received and posted under\nenforceable credit support agreements, when\ntransacted under an enforceable netting\nagreement. In the consolidated balance sheets,\nresale and repurchase agreements, and\nsecurities borrowed and loaned, are not\nreported net of the related cash and\nsecurities received or posted as collateral.\nSee Note 11 for further information about\ncollateral received and pledged, including\nrights to deliver or repledge collateral. See\nNotes 7 and 11 for further information about\noffsetting assets and liabilities. Share-Based\nCompensation The cost of employee services\nreceived in exchange for a share-based award\nis generally measured based on the grant-date\nfair value of the award. Share-based awards\nthat do not require future service (i.e.,\nvested awards, including awards granted to\nretirement-eligible employees) are expensed\nimmediately. Share-based awards that require\nfuture service are amortized over the relevant\nservice period. Forfeitures are recorded when\nthey occur. Cash dividend equivalents paid on\nrestricted stock units (RSUs) are generally\ncharged to retained earnings. If RSUs that\nrequire future service are forfeited, the\nrelated dividend equivalents originally\ncharged to retained earnings are reclassified\nto compensation expense in the period in which\nforfeiture occurs. The firm generally issues\nnew shares of common stock upon delivery of\nshare-based awards. In limited cases, as\noutlined in the applicable award agreements,\nthe firm may cash settle share-based\ncompensation awards accounted for as equity\ninstruments. For these awards, additional\npaid-in capital is adjusted to the extent of\nthe difference between the value of the award\nat the time of cash settlement and the grant-\ndate value of the award. The tax effects\nrelated to the settlement of share-based\nawards and payments of dividend equivalents\nare recorded in income tax benefit or expense.\nForeign Currency Translation Assets and\nliabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies\nare translated at rates of exchange prevailing\non the date of the consolidated balance sheets\nand revenues and expenses are translated at\naverage rates of exchange for the period.\nForeign currency remeasurement gains or losses\non transactions in nonfunctional currencies\nare recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on\ntranslation of the financial statements of a\nnon-U.S. operation, when the functional\ncurrency is other than the U.S. dollar, are\nincluded, net of hedges and taxes, in the\nconsolidated statements of comprehensive\nincome.\n                                           \n  Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q    10  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Fair Value Measurements The fair value\nof a financial instrument is the amount that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Financial assets are marked to bid\nprices and financial liabilities are marked to\noffer prices. Fair value measurements do not\ninclude transaction costs. The firm measures\ncertain financial assets and liabilities as a\nportfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to\nmarket and/or credit risks). The best evidence\nof fair value is a quoted price in an active\nmarket. If quoted prices in active markets are\nnot available, fair value is determined by\nreference to prices for similar instruments,\nquoted prices or recent transactions in less\nactive markets, or internally developed models\nthat primarily use market-based or\nindependently sourced inputs, including, but\nnot limited to, interest rates, volatilities,\nequity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates,\ncommodity prices, credit spreads and funding\nspreads (i.e., the spread or difference\nbetween the interest rate at which a borrower\ncould finance a given financial instrument\nrelative to a benchmark interest rate). U.S.\nGAAP has a three-level hierarchy for\ndisclosure of fair value measurements. This\nhierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation\ntechniques used to measure fair value, giving\nthe highest priority to level 1 inputs and the\nlowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial\ninstrument\u2019s level in this hierarchy is based\non the lowest level of input that is\nsignificant to its fair value measurement. In\nevaluating the significance of a valuation\ninput, the firm considers, among other\nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to\nthat input. The fair value hierarchy is as\nfollows: Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets to which the firm had\naccess at the measurement date for identical,\nunrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2.\nInputs to valuation techniques are observable,\neither directly or indirectly. Level 3. One or\nmore inputs to valuation techniques are\nsignificant and unobservable. The fair values\nfor substantially all of the firm\u2019s financial\nassets and liabilities are based on observable\nprices and inputs and are classified in levels\n1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain\nlevel 2 and level 3 financial assets and\nliabilities may require valuation adjustments\nthat a market participant would require to\narrive at fair value for factors, such as\ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality,\nfunding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity\nand bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments\nare generally based on market evidence.\nThe table below\npresents financial\nassets and liabilities\ncarried at fair value.\n                                              \n  $

Level 1 instruments include\nU.S. government obligations, most non-U.S.\ngovernment obligations, certain agency\nobligations, certain corporate debt\ninstruments, certain money market instruments\nand actively traded listed equities. These\ninstruments are valued using quoted prices for\nidentical unrestricted instruments in active\nmarkets. The firm defines active markets for\nequity instruments based on the average daily\ntrading volume both in absolute terms and\nrelative to the market capitalization for the\ninstrument. The firm defines active markets\nfor debt instruments based on both the average\ndaily trading volume and the number of days\nwith trading activity. Level 2. Level 2\ninstruments include certain non-U.S.\ngovernment obligations, most agency\nobligations, most mortgage-backed loans and\nsecurities, most corporate debt instruments,\nmost state and municipal obligations, most\nmoney market instruments, most other debt\nobligations, restricted or less liquid listed\nequities, certain private equities,\ncommodities and certain lending commitments.\nValuations of level 2 instruments can be\nverified to quoted prices, recent trading\nactivity for identical or similar instruments,\nbroker or dealer quotations or alternative\npricing sources with reasonable levels of\nprice transparency. Consideration is given to\nthe nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative\nor executable) and the relationship of recent\nmarket activity to the prices provided from\nalternative pricing sources. Valuation\nadjustments are typically made to level 2\ninstruments (i) if the instrument is subject\nto transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other\npremiums and liquidity discounts that a market\nparticipant would require to arrive at fair\nvalue. Valuation adjustments are generally\nbased on market evidence. Level 3. Level 3\ninstruments have one or more significant\nvaluation inputs that are not observable.\nAbsent evidence to the contrary, level 3\ninstruments are initially valued at\ntransaction price, which is considered to be\nthe best initial estimate of fair value.\nSubsequently, the firm uses other\nmethodologies to determine fair value, which\nvary based on the type of instrument.\nValuation inputs and assumptions are changed\nwhen corroborated by substantive observable\nevidence, including values realized on sales.\nValuation techniques of level 3 instruments\nvary by instrument, but are generally based on\ndiscounted cash flow techniques. The valuation\ntechniques and the nature of significant\ninputs used to determine the fair values of\neach type of level 3 instrument are described\nbelow: Loans and Securities Backed by\nCommercial Real Estate Loans and securities\nbacked by commercial real estate are directly\nor indirectly collateralized by a single\nproperty or a portfolio of properties, and may\ninclude tranches of varying levels of\nsubordination. Significant inputs are\ngenerally determined based on relative value\nanalyses and include: \u2022 Market yields implied\nby transactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and changes in market\nindices, such as the CMBX (an index that\ntracks the performance of commercial mortgage\nbonds); \u2022 Transaction prices in both the\nunderlying collateral and instruments with the\nsame or similar underlying collateral; \u2022 A\nmeasure of expected future cash flows in a\ndefault scenario (recovery rates) implied by\nthe value of the underlying collateral, which\nis mainly driven by current performance of the\nunderlying collateral and capitalization\nrates. Recovery rates are expressed as a\npercentage of notional or face value of the\ninstrument and reflect the benefit of credit\nenhancements on certain instruments; and \u2022\nTiming of expected future cash flows\n(duration) which, in certain cases, may\nincorporate the impact of any loan\nforbearances and other unobservable inputs\n(e.g., prepayment speeds). Loans and\nSecurities Backed by Residential Real Estate\nLoans and securities backed by residential\nreal estate are directly or indirectly\ncollateralized by portfolios of residential\nreal estate and may include tranches of\nvarying levels of subordination. Significant\ninputs are generally determined based on\nrelative value analyses, which incorporate\ncomparisons to instruments with similar\ncollateral and risk profiles. Significant\ninputs include: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets; \u2022\nTransaction prices in both the underlying\ncollateral and instruments with the same or\nsimilar underlying collateral; \u2022 Cumulative\nloss expectations, driven by default rates,\nhome price projections, residential property\nliquidation timelines, related costs and\nsubsequent recoveries; and \u2022 Duration, driven\nby underlying loan prepayment speeds and\nresidential property liquidation timelines.\n                                           \n  13    Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Significant inputs\ninclude: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and trends of market\nindices, such as the CDX (an index that tracks\nthe performance of corporate credit); \u2022\nCurrent performance and recovery assumptions\nand, where the firm uses credit default swaps\nto value the related instrument, the cost of\nborrowing the underlying reference obligation;\n\u2022 Duration; and \u2022 Market and transaction\nmultiples for corporate debt instruments with\nconvertibility or participation options.\nEquity Securities Equity securities consists\nof private equities. Recent third-party\ncompleted or pending transactions (e.g.,\nmerger proposals, debt restructurings, tender\noffers) are considered the best evidence for\nany change in fair value. When these are not\navailable, the following valuation\nmethodologies are used, as appropriate: \u2022\nIndustry multiples (primarily EBITDA and\nrevenue multiples) and public comparables; \u2022\nTransactions in similar instruments; \u2022\nDiscounted cash flow techniques; and \u2022 Third-\nparty appraisals. The firm also considers\nchanges in the outlook for the relevant\nindustry and financial performance of the\nissuer as compared to projected performance.\nSignificant inputs include: \u2022 Market and\ntransaction multiples; \u2022 Discount rates and\ncapitalization rates; and \u2022 For equity\nsecurities with debt-like features, market\nyields implied by transactions of similar or\nrelated assets, current performance and\nrecovery assumptions, and duration. Other\nTrading Cash Instruments, Investments and\nLoans The significant inputs to the valuation\nof other instruments, such as non-U.S.\ngovernment and agency obligations, state and\nmunicipal obligations, and other loans and\ndebt obligations are generally determined\nbased on relative value analyses, which\nincorporate comparisons both to prices of\ncredit default swaps that reference the same\nor similar underlying instrument or entity and\nto other debt instruments for the same issuer\nfor which observable prices or broker\nquotations are available. Significant inputs\ninclude: \u2022 Market yields implied by\ntransactions of similar or related assets\nand/or current levels and trends of market\nindices; \u2022 Current performance and recovery\nassumptions and, where the firm uses credit\ndefault swaps to value the related instrument,\nthe cost of borrowing the underlying reference\nobligation; and \u2022 Duration. Valuation\nTechniques and Significant Inputs for\nDerivatives The firm\u2019s level 2 and level 3\nderivatives are valued using derivative\npricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow\nmodels, correlation models and models that\nincorporate option pricing methodologies, such\nas Monte Carlo simulations). Price\ntransparency of derivatives can generally be\ncharacterized by product type, as described\nbelow. \u2022 Interest Rate. In general, the key\ninputs used to value interest rate derivatives\nare transparent, even for most long-dated\ncontracts. Interest rate swaps and options\ndenominated in the currencies of leading\nindustrialized nations are characterized by\nhigh trading volumes and tight bid/offer\nspreads. Interest rate derivatives that\nreference indices, such as an inflation index,\nor the shape of the yield curve (e.g., 10-year\nswap rate vs. 2-year swap rate) are more\ncomplex, but the key inputs are generally\nobservable. \u2022 Credit. Price transparency for\ncredit default swaps, including both single\nnames and baskets of credits, varies by market\nand underlying reference entity or obligation.\nCredit default swaps that reference indices,\nlarge corporates and major sovereigns\ngenerally exhibit the most price transparency.\nFor credit default swaps with other\nunderliers, price transparency varies based on\ncredit rating, the cost of borrowing the\nunderlying reference obligations, and the\navailability of the underlying reference\nobligations for delivery upon the default of\nthe issuer. Credit default swaps that\nreference loans, asset-backed securities and\nemerging market debt instruments tend to have\nless price transparency than those that\nreference corporate bonds. In addition, more\ncomplex credit derivatives, such as those\nsensitive to the correlation between two or\nmore underlying reference obligations,\ngenerally have less price transparency.\n                                           \n  Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q    14  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\n\u2022 Currency. Prices for currency derivatives\nbased on the exchange rates of leading\nindustrialized nations, including those with\nlonger tenors, are generally transparent. The\nprimary difference between the price\ntransparency of developed and emerging market\ncurrency derivatives is that emerging markets\ntend to be only observable for contracts with\nshorter tenors. \u2022 Commodity. Commodity\nderivatives include transactions referenced to\nenergy (e.g., oil, natural gas and\nelectricity), metals (e.g., precious and base)\nand soft commodities (e.g., agricultural).\nPrice transparency varies based on the\nunderlying commodity, delivery location, tenor\nand product quality (e.g., diesel fuel\ncompared to unleaded gasoline). In general,\nprice transparency for commodity derivatives\nis greater for contracts with shorter tenors\nand contracts that are more closely aligned\nwith major and/or benchmark commodity indices.\n\u2022 Equity. Price transparency for equity\nderivatives varies by market and underlier.\nOptions on indices and the common stock of\ncorporates included in major equity indices\nexhibit the most price transparency. Equity\nderivatives generally have observable market\nprices, except for contracts with long tenors\nor reference prices that differ significantly\nfrom current market prices. More complex\nequity derivatives, such as those sensitive to\nthe correlation between two or more individual\nstocks, generally have less price\ntransparency. Liquidity is essential to the\nobservability of all product types. If\ntransaction volumes decline, previously\ntransparent prices and other inputs may become\nunobservable. Conversely, even highly\nstructured products may at times have trading\nvolumes large enough to provide observability\nof prices and other inputs. Level 1. Level 1\nderivatives include short-term contracts for\nfuture delivery of securities when the\nunderlying security is a level 1 instrument,\nand exchange-traded derivatives if they are\nactively traded and are valued at their quoted\nmarket price. Level 2. Level 2 derivatives\ninclude OTC derivatives for which all\nsignificant valuation inputs are corroborated\nby market evidence and exchange-traded\nderivatives that are not actively traded\nand/or that are valued using models that\ncalibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC\nderivatives. The selection of a particular\nmodel to value a derivative depends on the\ncontractual terms of and specific risks\ninherent in the instrument, as well as the\navailability of pricing information in the\nmarket. For derivatives that trade in liquid\nmarkets, model selection does not involve\nsignificant management judgment because\noutputs of models can be calibrated to market-\nclearing levels. Valuation models require a\nvariety of inputs, such as contractual terms,\nmarket prices, yield curves, discount rates\n(including those derived from interest rates\non collateral received and posted as specified\nin credit support agreements for\ncollateralized derivatives), credit curves,\nmeasures of volatility, prepayment rates, loss\nseverity rates and correlations of such\ninputs. Significant inputs to the valuations\nof level 2 derivatives can be verified to\nmarket transactions, broker or dealer\nquotations or other alternative pricing\nsources with reasonable levels of price\ntransparency. Consideration is given to the\nnature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or\nexecutable) and the relationship of recent\nmarket activity to the prices provided from\nalternative pricing sources. Level 3 . Level 3\nderivatives are valued using models which\nutilize observable level 1 and/or level 2\ninputs, as well as unobservable level 3\ninputs. The significant unobservable inputs\nused to value the firm\u2019s level 3 derivatives\nare described below. \u2022 For level 3 interest\nrate and currency derivatives, significant\nunobservable inputs include correlations of\ncertain currencies and interest rates (e.g.,\nthe correlation between Euro inflation and\nEuro interest rates) and specific interest\nrate and currency volatilities. \u2022 For level 3\ncredit derivatives, significant unobservable\ninputs include illiquid credit spreads and\nupfront credit points, which are unique to\nspecific reference obligations and reference\nentities, and recovery rates. \u2022 For level 3\ncommodity derivatives, significant\nunobservable inputs include volatilities for\noptions with strike prices that differ\nsignificantly from current market prices and\nprices or spreads for certain products for\nwhich the product quality or physical location\nof the commodity is not aligned with benchmark\nindices. \u2022 For level 3 equity derivatives,\nsignificant unobservable inputs generally\ninclude equity volatility inputs for options\nthat are long-dated and/or have strike prices\nthat differ significantly from current market\nprices. In addition, the valuation of certain\nstructured trades requires the use of level 3\ncorrelation inputs, such as the correlation of\nthe price performance of two or more\nindividual stocks or the correlation of the\nprice performance for a basket of stocks to\nanother asset class, such as commodities.\n                                           \n  15    Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Level 3 inputs are\nchanged when corroborated by evidence, such as\nsimilar market transactions, third-party\npricing services and/or broker or dealer\nquotations or other empirical market data. In\ncircumstances where the firm cannot verify the\nmodel value by reference to market\ntransactions, it is possible that a different\nvaluation model could produce a materially\ndifferent estimate of fair value. See Note 5\nfor further information about significant\nunobservable inputs used in the valuation of\nlevel 3 derivatives. Valuation Adjustments.\nValuation adjustments are integral to\ndetermining the fair value of derivative\nportfolios and are used to adjust the mid-\nmarket valuations produced by derivative\npricing models to the exit price valuation.\nThese adjustments incorporate bid/offer\nspreads, the cost of liquidity, and credit and\nfunding valuation adjustments, which account\nfor the credit and funding risk inherent in\nthe uncollateralized portion of derivative\nportfolios. The firm also makes funding\nvaluation adjustments to collateralized\nderivatives where the terms of the agreement\ndo not permit the firm to deliver or repledge\ncollateral received. Market-based inputs are\ngenerally used when calibrating valuation\nadjustments to market-clearing levels. In\naddition, for derivatives that include\nsignificant unobservable inputs, the firm\nmakes model or exit price adjustments to\naccount for the valuation uncertainty present\nin the transaction. Valuation Techniques and\nSignificant Inputs for Other Financial Assets\nand Liabilities at Fair Value In addition to\ntrading cash instruments, derivatives, and\ncertain investments and loans, the firm\naccounts for certain of its other financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value under the\nfair value option. Such instruments include\nrepurchase agreements and substantially all\nresale agreements; certain securities borrowed\nand loaned transactions; certain customer and\nother receivables, including certain margin\nloans; certain time deposits, including\nstructured certificates of deposit, which are\nhybrid financial instruments; substantially\nall other secured financings, including\ntransfers of assets accounted for as\nfinancings; certain unsecured short- and long-\nterm borrowings, substantially all of which\nare hybrid financial instruments; and certain\nother assets and liabilities. These\ninstruments are generally valued based on\ndiscounted cash flow techniques, which\nincorporate inputs with reasonable levels of\nprice transparency, and are generally\nclassified in level 2 because the inputs are\nobservable. Valuation adjustments may be made\nfor liquidity and for counterparty and the\nfirm\u2019s credit quality. The significant inputs\nused to value the firm\u2019s other financial\nassets and liabilities are described below.\nResale and Repurchase Agreements and\nSecurities Borrowed and Loaned. The\nsignificant inputs to the valuation of resale\nand repurchase agreements and securities\nborrowed and loaned are funding spreads, the\namount and timing of expected future cash\nflows and interest rates. Customer and Other\nReceivables. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of receivables are interest rates,\nthe amount and timing of expected future cash\nflows and funding spreads. Deposits. The\nsignificant inputs to the valuation of time\ndeposits are interest rates and the amount and\ntiming of future cash flows. The inputs used\nto value the embedded derivative component of\nhybrid financial instruments are consistent\nwith the inputs used to value the firm\u2019s other\nderivative instruments described above. See\nNote 7 for further information about\nderivatives and Note 13 for further\ninformation about deposits. Other Secured\nFinancings. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of other secured financings are the\namount and timing of expected future cash\nflows, interest rates, funding spreads and the\nfair value of the collateral delivered by the\nfirm (determined using the amount and timing\nof expected future cash flows, market prices,\nmarket yields and recovery assumptions). See\nNote 11 for further information about other\nsecured financings. Unsecured Short- and Long-\nTerm Borrowings. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of unsecured short- and long-term\nborrowings are the amount and timing of\nexpected future cash flows, interest rates,\nthe credit spreads of the firm and commodity\nprices for prepaid commodity transactions. The\ninputs used to value the embedded derivative\ncomponent of hybrid financial instruments are\nconsistent with the inputs used to value the\nfirm\u2019s other derivative instruments described\nabove. See Note 7 for further information\nabout derivatives and Note 14 for further\ninformation about borrowings. Other Assets and\nLiabilities. The significant inputs to the\nvaluation of other assets and liabilities are\nthe amount and timing of expected future cash\nflows, interest rates, market yields,\nvolatility and correlation inputs.

For example,\nthe highest multiple for private equity\nsecurities is appropriate for valuing a\nspecific private equity security but may not\nbe appropriate for valuing any other private\nequity security. Accordingly, the ranges of\ninputs do not represent uncertainty in, or\npossible ranges of, fair value measurements of\nlevel 3 investments.\n\n\u2022 Increases in yield, discount rate,\ncapitalization rate or duration used in the\nvaluation of level 3 investments would have\nresulted in a lower fair value measurement,\nwhile increases in recovery rate or multiples\nwould have resulted in a higher fair value\nmeasurement as of both June 2023 and December\n2022. Due to the distinctive nature of each\nlevel 3 investment, the interrelationship of\ninputs is not necessarily uniform within each\nproduct type.\n\n\u2022 Corporate debt securities, securities backed\nby real estate and other debt obligations are\nvalued using discounted cash flows, and equity\nsecurities are valued using market comparables\nand discounted cash flows.\n\u2022 The fair value of\nany one instrument may\nbe determined using\nmultiple valuation\ntechniques. For\nexample, market\ncomparables and\ndiscounted cash flows\nmay be used together\nto determine fair\nvalue.

See Note 23\nfor further\ninformation about\ninterest income and\ninterest expense.\n\u2022 Gains/(losses)\nincluded in market\nmaking are primarily\nrelated to the firm\u2019s\ntrading assets and\nliabilities, including\nboth derivative and\nnon-derivative\nfinancial instruments.\n\u2022 Gains/(losses) are\nnot representative of\nthe manner in which\nthe firm manages its\nbusiness activities\nbecause many of the\nfirm\u2019s market-making\nand client\nfacilitation\nstrategies utilize\nfinancial instruments\nacross various product\ntypes. Accordingly,\ngains or losses in one\nproduct type\nfrequently offset\ngains or losses in\nother product types.\nFor example, most of\nthe firm\u2019s longer-term\nderivatives across\nproduct types are\nsensitive to changes\nin interest rates and\nmay be economically\nhedged with interest\nrate swaps. Similarly,\na significant portion\nof the firm\u2019s trading\ncash instruments and\nderivatives across\nproduct types has\nexposure to foreign\ncurrencies and may be\neconomically hedged\nwith foreign currency\ncontracts.\nNote 7. Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nDerivative Activities Derivatives are\ninstruments that derive their value from\nunderlying asset prices, indices, reference\nrates and other inputs, or a combination of\nthese factors. Derivatives may be traded on an\nexchange (exchange-traded) or they may be\nprivately negotiated contracts, which are\nusually referred to as OTC derivatives.\nCertain of the firm\u2019s OTC derivatives are\ncleared and settled through central clearing\ncounterparties (OTC-cleared), while others are\nbilateral contracts between two counterparties\n(bilateral OTC). Market Making. As a market\nmaker, the firm enters into derivative\ntransactions to provide liquidity to clients\nand to facilitate the transfer and hedging of\ntheir risks. In this role, the firm typically\nacts as principal and is required to commit\ncapital to provide execution, and maintains\nmarket-making positions in response to, or in\nanticipation of, client demand.\n\nRisk Management. The firm also enters into\nderivatives to actively manage risk exposures\nthat arise from its market-making and\ninvesting and financing activities. The firm\u2019s\nholdings and exposures are hedged, in many\ncases, on either a portfolio or risk-specific\nbasis, as opposed to an instrument-by-\ninstrument basis. The offsetting impact of\nthis economic hedging is reflected in the same\nbusiness segment as the related revenues. In\naddition, the firm may enter into derivatives\ndesignated as hedges under U.S. GAAP. These\nderivatives are used to manage interest rate\nexposure of certain fixed-rate unsecured\nborrowings and deposits and certain U.S. and\nnon-U.S. government securities classified as\navailable-for-sale, foreign exchange risk of\ncertain available-for-sale securities and the\nnet investment in certain non-U.S. operations.\nThe firm enters into various types of\nderivatives, including: \u2022 Futures and\nForwards. Contracts that commit counterparties\nto purchase or sell financial instruments,\ncommodities or currencies in the future. \u2022\nSwaps. Contracts that require counterparties\nto exchange cash flows, such as currency or\ninterest payment streams. The amounts\nexchanged are based on the specific terms of\nthe contract with reference to specified\nrates, financial instruments, commodities,\ncurrencies or indices. \u2022 Options. Contracts in\nwhich the option purchaser has the right, but\nnot the obligation, to purchase from or sell\nto the option writer financial instruments,\ncommodities or currencies within a defined\ntime period for a specified price. Derivatives\nare reported on a net-by-counterparty basis\n(i.e., the net payable or receivable for\nderivative assets and liabilities for a given\ncounterparty) when a legal right of setoff\nexists under an enforceable netting agreement\n(counterparty netting). Derivatives are\naccounted for at fair value, net of cash\ncollateral received or posted under\nenforceable credit support agreements (cash\ncollateral netting). Derivative assets are\nincluded in trading assetsand derivative\nliabilities are included in trading\nliabilities. Realized and unrealized gains and\nlosseson derivatives not designated as hedges\nare included in market making (for derivatives\nincluded in Fixed Income, Currency and\nCommodities (FICC) and Equities within Global\nBanking & Markets), and other principal\ntransactions (for derivatives included in\nInvestment banking fees and Other within\nGlobal Banking & Markets, as well as\nderivatives in Asset & Wealth Management) in\nthe consolidated statements of earnings. For\neach of the three and six months ended June\n2023 and June 2022, substantially all of the\nfirm\u2019s derivatives were included in Global\nBanking & Markets.\n                                           \n  33    Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Credit\nDerivatives The firm\nenters into a broad\narray of credit\nderivatives to\nfacilitate client\ntransactions and to\nmanage the credit risk\nassociated with\nmarket-making and\ninvesting and\nfinancing activities.\nCredit derivatives are\nactively managed based\non the firm\u2019s net risk\nposition. Credit\nderivatives are\ngenerally individually\nnegotiated contracts\nand can have various\nsettlement and payment\nconventions. Credit\nevents include failure\nto pay, bankruptcy,\nacceleration of\nindebtedness,\nrestructuring,\nrepudiation and\ndissolution of the\nreference entity. The\nfirm enters into the\nfollowing types of\ncredit derivatives: \u2022\nCredit Default Swaps.\nSingle-name credit\ndefault swaps protect\nthe buyer against the\nloss of principal on\none or more bonds,\nloans or mortgages\n(reference\nobligations) in the\nevent the issuer of\nthe reference\nobligations suffers a\ncredit event. The\nbuyer of protection\npays an initial or\nperiodic premium to\nthe seller and\nreceives protection\nfor the period of the\ncontract. If there is\nno credit event, as\ndefined in the\ncontract, the seller\nof protection makes no\npayments to the buyer.\nIf a credit event\noccurs, the seller of\nprotection is required\nto make a payment to\nthe buyer, calculated\naccording to the terms\nof the contract. \u2022\nCredit Options. In a\ncredit option, the\noption writer assumes\nthe obligation to\npurchase or sell a\nreference obligation\nat a specified price\nor credit spread. The\noption purchaser buys\nthe right, but does\nnot assume the\nobligation, to sell\nthe reference\nobligation to, or\npurchase it from, the\noption writer. The\npayments on credit\noptions depend either\non a particular credit\nspread or the price of\nthe reference\nobligation.\n                                           \n  35    Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

If\na credit event occurs\nin one of the\nunderlying reference\nobligations, the\nprotection seller pays\nthe protection buyer.\nThe payment is\ntypically a pro-rata\nportion of the\ntransaction\u2019s total\nnotional amount based\non the underlying\ndefaulted reference\nobligation. In certain\ntransactions, the\ncredit risk of a\nbasket or index is\nseparated into various\nportions (tranches),\neach having different\nlevels of\nsubordination. The\nmost junior tranches\ncover initial defaults\nand once losses exceed\nthe notional amount of\nthese junior tranches,\nany excess loss is\ncovered by the next\nmost senior tranche. \u2022\nTotal Return Swaps. A\ntotal return swap\ntransfers the risks\nrelating to economic\nperformance of a\nreference obligation\nfrom the protection\nbuyer to the\nprotection seller.\nTypically, the\nprotection buyer\nreceives a floating\nrate of interest and\nprotection against any\nreduction in fair\nvalue of the reference\nobligation, and the\nprotection seller\nreceives the cash\nflows associated with\nthe reference\nobligation, plus any\nincrease in the fair\nvalue of the reference\nobligation. The firm\neconomically hedges\nits exposure to\nwritten credit\nderivatives primarily\nby entering into\noffsetting purchased\ncredit derivatives\nwith identical\nunderliers.\nSubstantially all of\nthe firm\u2019s purchased\ncredit derivative\ntransactions are with\nfinancial institutions\nand are subject to\nstringent collateral\nthresholds. In\naddition, upon the\noccurrence of a\nspecified trigger\nevent, the firm may\ntake possession of the\nreference obligations\nunderlying a\nparticular written\ncredit derivative, and\nconsequently may, upon\nliquidation of the\nreference obligations,\nrecover amounts on the\nunderlying reference\nobligations in the\nevent of default. As\nof June 2023, written\ncredit derivatives had\na total gross notional\namount of $\n582.09billion and\npurchased credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n650.52billion, for\ntotal net notional\npurchased protection\nof $ 68.43billion. As\nof December 2022,\nwritten credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n528.31billion and\npurchased credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n579.14billion, for\ntotal net notional\npurchased protection\nof $ 50.83billion.

Corporate\nloans are secured (typically by a senior lien\non the assets of the borrower) or unsecured,\ndepending on the loan purpose, the risk\nprofile of the borrower and other factors. \u2022\nCommercial Real Estate. Commercial real estate\nloans includes originated loans that are\ndirectly or indirectly secured by hotels,\nretail stores, multifamily housing complexes\nand commercial and industrial properties.\nCommercial real estate loans also includes\nloans extended to clients who warehouse assets\nthat are directly or indirectly backed by\ncommercial real estate. In addition,\ncommercial real estate includes loans\npurchased by the firm. \u2022 Residential Real\nEstate. Residential real estate loans\nprimarily includes loans extended to wealth\nmanagement clients and to clients who\nwarehouse assets that are directly or\nindirectly secured by residential real estate.\nIn addition, residential real estate includes\nloans purchased by the firm. \u2022 Securities-\nBased. Securities-based loans includes loans\nthat are secured by stocks, bonds, mutual\nfunds, and exchange-traded funds. These loans\nare primarily extended to the firm's wealth\nmanagement clients and used for purposes other\nthan purchasing, carrying or trading margin\nstocks. Securities-based loans require\nborrowers to post additional collateral based\non changes in the underlying collateral's fair\nvalue. \u2022 Other Collateralized. Other\ncollateralized loans includes loans that are\nbacked by specific collateral (other than\nsecurities and real estate). Such loans are\nextended to clients who warehouse assets that\nare directly or indirectly secured by\ncorporate loans, consumer loans and other\nassets. Other collateralized loans also\nincludes loans to investment funds (managed by\nthird parties) that are collateralized by\ncapital commitments of the funds' investors or\nassets held by the fund, as well as other\nsecured loans extended to the firm's wealth\nmanagement clients. \u2022 Installment. Installment\nloans are unsecured loans originated by the\nfirm. \u2022 Credit Cards. Credit card loans are\nloans made pursuant to revolving lines of\ncredit issued to consumers by the firm. \u2022\nOther. Other loans includes unsecured loans\nextended to wealth management clients and\nunsecured consumer and credit card loans\npurchased by the firm. See Note 4 for an\noverview of the firm\u2019s fair value measurement\npolicies, valuation techniques and significant\ninputs used to determine the fair value of\nloans, and Note 5 for information about loans\nwithin the fair value hierarchy. Credit\nQuality Risk Assessment. The firm\u2019s risk\nassessment process includes evaluating the\ncredit quality of its loans by the firm\u2019s\nindependent risk oversight and control\nfunction. For corporate loans and a majority\nof securities-based, real estate, other\ncollateralized and other loans, the firm\nperforms credit analyses which incorporate\ninitial and ongoing evaluations of the\ncapacity and willingness of a borrower to meet\nits financial obligations. These credit\nevaluations are performed on an annual basis\nor more frequently if deemed necessary as a\nresult of events or changes in circumstances.\nThe firm determines an internal credit rating\nfor the borrower by considering the results of\nthe credit evaluations and assumptions with\nrespect to the nature of and outlook for the\nborrower\u2019s industry and the economic\nenvironment. Beginning in the first quarter of\n2023, the firm also takes into consideration\ncollateral received or other credit support\narrangements when determining an internal\ncredit rating on collateralized loans, as\nmanagement believes that this methodology\nbetter reflects the credit quality of the\nunderlying loans. In the table below, prior\nperiod amounts have been conformed to reflect\nthe current methodology. The impact to\nDecember 2022 was an increase in loans\nclassified as investment-grade and a decrease\nin loans classified as non-investment-grade of\n$ 25.0billion in real estate (warehouse loans)\nand other collateralized loans. For consumer\nloans and for loans that are not assigned an\ninternal credit rating, the firm reviews\ncertain key metrics, including, but not\nlimited to, the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO)\ncredit scores, delinquency status, collateral\nvalue and other risk factors.\n                                           \n  43    Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These\nmodifications, to the\nextent significant,\nwere considered TDRs\nas of December 2022.\nIn January 2023, the\nfirm adopted ASU No.\n2022-02, which\neliminated the\nrecognition and\nmeasurement guidance\nfor TDRs and requires\nenhanced disclosures\nfor certain loan\nmodifications. As of\nDecember 2022, loans\nmodified in a TDR were\n$ 231million and\ncommitments related to\nsuch loans were not\nmaterial.\nSubstantially all of\nsuch loans modified in\na TDR were related to\ncorporate and\ncommercial real estate\nloans. During both the\nthree and six months\nended June 2023, the\nfirm provided loan\nmodifications (in the\nform of term\nextensions) to\nborrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty.\nAs of June 2023, the\ncarrying value of\nloans modified during\nthe three months ended\nJune 2023 was $\n424million and the\ncarrying value of\nloans modified during\nthe six months ended\nJune 2023 was $\n594million. Lending\ncommitments related to\nsuch loans were not\nmaterial and such loan\nmodifications were\nprimarily related to\ncorporate and\ncommercial real estate\nloans. The impact of\nthese modifications\nwas not material for\neither the three or\nsix months ended June\n2023. During the six\nmonths ended June\n2023, the firm\ncharged-off\napproximately $\n100million of loans\nthat had defaulted\nafter being modified.\nSubstantially all of\nthe remaining modified\nloans were performing\nin accordance with the\nmodified contractual\nterms as of June 2023.\n\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses The firm\u2019s\nallowance for credit\nlosses consists of the\nallowance for losses\non loans and lending\ncommitments accounted\nfor at amortized cost.\nLoans and lending\ncommitments accounted\nfor at fair value or\naccounted for at the\nlower of cost or fair\nvalue are not subject\nto an allowance for\ncredit losses. To\ndetermine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses, the firm\nclassifies its loans\nand lending\ncommitments accounted\nfor at amortized cost\ninto wholesale and\nconsumer portfolios.\nThese portfolios\nrepresent the level at\nwhich the firm has\ndeveloped and\ndocumented its\nmethodology to\ndetermine the\nallowance for credit\nlosses. The allowance\nfor credit losses is\nmeasured on a\ncollective basis for\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics using\na modeled approach and\non an asset-specific\nbasis for loans that\ndo not share similar\nrisk characteristics.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses takes\ninto account the\nweighted average of a\nrange of forecasts of\nfuture economic\nconditions over the\nexpected life of the\nloan and lending\ncommitments. The\nexpected life of each\nloan or lending\ncommitment is\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual term\nadjusted for extension\noptions or demand\nfeatures, or is\nmodeled in the case of\nrevolving credit card\nloans. The forecasts\ninclude baseline,\nfavorable and adverse\neconomic scenarios\nover a three-year\nperiod. For loans with\nexpected lives beyond\nthree years, the model\nreverts to historical\nloss information based\non a non-linear\nmodeled approach. The\nforecasted economic\nscenarios consider a\nnumber of risk factors\nrelevant to the\nwholesale and consumer\nportfolios described\nbelow. The firm\napplies judgment in\nweighing individual\nscenarios each quarter\nbased on a variety of\nfactors, including the\nfirm\u2019s internally\nderived economic\noutlook, market\nconsensus, recent\nmacroeconomic\nconditions and\nindustry trends. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses also includes\nqualitative components\nwhich allow management\nto reflect the\nuncertain nature of\neconomic forecasting,\ncapture uncertainty\nregarding model\ninputs, and account\nfor model imprecision\nand concentration\nrisk.\n                                           \n  47    Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\nallowance for credit losses on these loans was\n$ 630million as of June 2023 and $ 535million\nas of December 2022. These loans included $\n687million as of June 2023 and $ 384million as\nof December 2022 of loans which did not\nrequire a reserve as the loan was deemed to be\nrecoverable.\nSee Note 18 for\nfurther information\nabout lending\ncommitments.\n\nThe following is a\ndescription of the\nmethodology used to\ncalculate the\nallowance for credit\nlosses: Wholesale. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses for wholesale\nloans and lending\ncommitments that\nexhibit similar risk\ncharacteristics is\nmeasured using a\nmodeled approach.\nThese models determine\nthe probability of\ndefault and loss given\ndefault based on\nvarious risk factors,\nincluding internal\ncredit ratings,\nindustry default and\nloss data, expected\nlife, macroeconomic\nindicators, the\nborrower\u2019s capacity to\nmeet its financial\nobligations, the\nborrower\u2019s country of\nrisk and industry,\nloan seniority and\ncollateral type. For\nlending commitments,\nthe methodology also\nconsiders the\nprobability of\ndrawdowns or funding.\nIn addition, for loans\nbacked by real estate,\nrisk factors include\nthe loan-to-value\nratio, debt service\nratio and home price\nindex. The most\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model for\nwholesale loans and\nlending commitments\ninclude unemployment\nrates, GDP, credit\nspreads, commercial\nand industrial\ndelinquency rates,\nshort- and long-term\ninterest rates, and\noil prices. The\nallowance for loan\nlosses for wholesale\nloans that do not\nshare similar risk\ncharacteristics, such\nas nonaccrual loans,\nis calculated using\nthe present value of\nexpected future cash\nflows discounted at\nthe loan\u2019s effective\nrate, the observable\nmarket price of the\nloan or the fair value\nof the collateral.\nWholesale loans are\ncharged off against\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses when deemed to\nbe uncollectible.\nConsumer. The\nallowance for credit\nlosses for consumer\nloans that exhibit\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics is\ncalculated using a\nmodeled approach which\nclassifies consumer\nloans into pools based\non borrower-related\nand exposure-related\ncharacteristics that\ndifferentiate a pool\u2019s\nrisk characteristics\nfrom other pools. The\nfactors considered in\ndetermining a pool are\ngenerally consistent\nwith the risk\ncharacteristics used\nfor internal credit\nrisk measurement and\nmanagement and include\nkey metrics, such as\nFICO credit scores,\ndelinquency status,\nloan vintage and\nmacroeconomic\nindicators. The most\nsignificant inputs to\nthe forecast model for\nconsumer loans include\nunemployment rates and\ndelinquency rates. The\nexpected life of\nrevolving credit card\nloans is determined by\nmodeling expected\nfuture draws and the\ntiming and amount of\nrepayments allocated\nto the funded balance.\nThe firm also\nrecognizes an\nallowance for credit\nlosses on commitments\nto acquire loans and\ncommitments extended\nin connection with\npoint-of-sale\nfinancing. However, no\nallowance for credit\nlosses is recognized\non credit card lending\ncommitments as they\nare cancellable by the\nfirm. Installment\nloans are charged off\nwhen they are 120 days\npast due. Credit card\nloans are charged off\nwhen they are 180 days\npast due.\n                                           \n  Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q    48  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm generally\ncalculates the fair value of loans and lending\ncommitments for which the fair value option is\nelected by discounting future cash flows at a\nrate which incorporates the instrument-\nspecific credit spreads. For floating-rate\nloans and lending commitments, substantially\nall changes in fair value are attributable to\nchanges in instrument-specific credit spreads,\nwhereas for fixed-rate loans and lending\ncommitments, changes in fair value are also\nattributable to changes in interest rates.\n\nNote 11. Collateralized Agreements and\nFinancings Collateralized agreements are\nresale agreements and securities borrowed.\nCollateralized financings are repurchase\nagreements, securities loaned and other\nsecured financings. The firm enters into these\ntransactions in order to, among other things,\nfacilitate client activities, invest excess\ncash, acquire securities to cover short\npositions and finance certain firm activities.\nCollateralized agreements and financings with\nthe same settlement date are presented on a\nnet-by-counterparty basis when such\ntransactions meet certain settlement criteria\nand are subject to netting agreements.\nInterest on collateralized agreements, which\nis included in interest income, and\ncollateralized financings, which is included\nin interest expense, is recognized over the\nlife of the transaction. See Note 23 for\nfurther information about interest income and\ninterest expense. Resale and Repurchase\nAgreements A resale agreement is a transaction\nin which the firm purchases financial\ninstruments from a seller, typically in\nexchange for cash, and simultaneously enters\ninto an agreement to resell the same or\nsubstantially the same financial instruments\nto the seller at a stated price plus accrued\ninterest at a future date. A repurchase\nagreement is a transaction in which the firm\nsells financial instruments to a buyer,\ntypically in exchange for cash, and\nsimultaneously enters into an agreement to\nrepurchase the same or substantially the same\nfinancial instruments from the buyer at a\nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. Even though repurchase and resale\nagreements (including \u201crepos- and reverses-to-\nmaturity\u201d) involve the legal transfer of\nownership of financial instruments, they are\naccounted for as financing arrangements\nbecause they require the financial instruments\nto be repurchased or resold before or at the\nmaturity of the agreement. The financial\ninstruments purchased or sold in resale and\nrepurchase agreements typically include U.S.\ngovernment and agency obligations, and\ninvestment-grade sovereign obligations. The\nfirm receives financial instruments purchased\nunder resale agreements and makes delivery of\nfinancial instruments sold under repurchase\nagreements. To mitigate credit exposure, the\nfirm monitors the market value of these\nfinancial instruments on a daily basis, and\ndelivers or obtains additional collateral due\nto changes in the market value of the\nfinancial instruments, as appropriate. For\nresale agreements, the firm typically requires\ncollateral with a fair value approximately\nequal to the carrying value of the relevant\nassets in the consolidated balance sheets.\n                                           \n  Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q    52  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

See Note 5 for\nfurther information\nabout repurchase and\nresale agreements.\nSecurities Borrowed\nand Loaned\nTransactions In a\nsecurities borrowed\ntransaction, the firm\nborrows securities\nfrom a counterparty in\nexchange for cash or\nsecurities. When the\nfirm returns the\nsecurities, the\ncounterparty returns\nthe cash or\nsecurities. Interest\nis generally paid\nperiodically over the\nlife of the\ntransaction. In a\nsecurities loaned\ntransaction, the firm\nlends securities to a\ncounterparty in\nexchange for cash or\nsecurities. When the\ncounterparty returns\nthe securities, the\nfirm returns the cash\nor securities posted\nas collateral.\nInterest is generally\npaid periodically over\nthe life of the\ntransaction. The firm\nreceives securities\nborrowed and makes\ndelivery of securities\nloaned. To mitigate\ncredit exposure, the\nfirm monitors the\nmarket value of these\nsecurities on a daily\nbasis, and delivers or\nobtains additional\ncollateral due to\nchanges in the market\nvalue of the\nsecurities, as\nappropriate. For\nsecurities borrowed\ntransactions, the firm\ntypically requires\ncollateral with a fair\nvalue approximately\nequal to the carrying\nvalue of the\nsecurities borrowed\ntransaction.\nSecurities borrowed\nand loaned within FICC\nfinancing are recorded\nat fair value under\nthe fair value option.\nSee Note 5 for further\ninformation about\nsecurities borrowed\nand loaned accounted\nfor at fair value.\nSubstantially all of\nthe securities\nborrowed and loaned\nwithin Equities\nfinancing are recorded\nbased on the amount of\ncash collateral\nadvanced or received\nplus accrued interest.\nThe firm also reviews\nsuch securities\nborrowed to determine\nif an allowance for\ncredit losses should\nbe recorded by taking\ninto consideration the\nfair value of\ncollateral received.\nAs these agreements\ngenerally can be\nterminated on demand,\nthey exhibit little,\nif any, sensitivity to\nchanges in interest\nrates.

Other secured\nfinancings that are\nnot recorded at fair\nvalue are recorded\nbased on the amount of\ncash received plus\naccrued interest,\nwhich generally\napproximates fair\nvalue.

During the first quarter\nof 2023, goodwill for Consumer platforms\nincreased by $ 22million as a result of an\nupdated purchase price allocation related to\nthe GreenSky acquisition. In connection with\nthe exploration of a potential sale of\nGreenSky, the firm performed a quantitative\ngoodwill test and determined that the goodwill\nassociated with Consumer platforms was\nimpaired, and accordingly, recorded a $\n504million impairment in the second quarter of\n2023.\n\u2022 During 2022,\ngoodwill incr eased by\n$ 2.09billion,\nsubstantially all in\nconnection with the\nacquisitions of\nGreenSky and NN\nInvestment Partners\n(NNIP). Goodwill is\nassessed for\nimpairment annually in\nthe fourth quarter or\nmore frequently if\nevents occur or\ncircumstances change\nthat indicate an\nimpairment may exist.\nWhen assessing\ngoodwill for\nimpairment, first, a\nqualitative assessment\ncan be made to\ndetermine whether it\nis more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of a\nreporting unit is less\nthan its carrying\nvalue. If the results\nof the qualitative\nassessment are not\nconclusive, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest is performed.\nAlternatively, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest can be performed\nwithout performing a\nqualitative\nassessment. The\nquantitative goodwill\ntest compares the\nestimated fair value\nof each reporting unit\nwith its carrying\nvalue (including\ngoodwill and\nidentifiable\nintangible assets). If\nthe reporting unit\u2019s\nestimated fair value\nexceeds its carrying\nvalue, goodwill is not\nimpaired. An\nimpairment is\nrecognized if the\nestimated fair value\nof a reporting unit is\nless than its carrying\nvalue and any such\nimpairment is included\nin depreciation and\namortization.\n\nIn the fourth quarter\nof 2022, goodwill was\ntested for impairment\nusing a quantitative\ntest. The estimated\nfair value of each of\nthe reporting units\nexceeded its\nrespective carrying\nvalue, and therefore,\ngoodwill was not\nimpaired. The\nestimated fair value\nof each reporting unit\nwas based on valuation\ntechniques the firm\nbelieves market\nparticipants would use\nto value these\nreporting units.\nEstimated fair values\nare generally derived\nfrom utilizing a\nrelative value\ntechnique, which\napplies observable\nprice-to-earnings\nmultiples or price-to-\nbook multiples of\ncomparable competitors\nto the reporting\nunits\u2019 net earnings or\nnet book value, or a\ndiscounted cash flow\nvaluation approach,\nfor reporting units\nwith businesses in\nearly stages of\ndevelopment. The\ncarrying value of each\nreporting unit\nreflects an allocation\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity and represents\nthe estimated amount\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity required to\nsupport the activities\nof the reporting unit\nunder currently\napplicable regulatory\ncapital requirements.\nBased on the\nevaluation of relevant\nfactors during the\nsecond quarter of\n2023, other than the\nimpairment noted\nabove, the firm\ndetermined that it was\nmore likely than not\nthat the estimated\nfair value of each of\nthe reporting units\nexceeded its\nrespective carrying\nvalue as of June 2023.\nIdentifiable\nIntangible Assets\nThe table below presents identifiable\nintangible assets by type.\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  mill\u2026                                       \n  Cust\u2026                                       \n  lists                                       \n  and                                         \n  merc\u2026               June                    \n  rela\u2026        As of  2023     Decemb\u2026  2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Gross                                       \n  carr\u2026    $   3,235        $    3,225        \n  value                                       \n  Accu\u2026       -1,360            -1,275        \n  amor\u2026                                       \n  Net                                         \n  carr\u2026        1,875             1,950        \n  value                                       \n  Acqu\u2026                                       \n  leas\u2026                                       \n  and                                         \n  other                                       \n  Gross                                       \n  carr\u2026          485               486        \n  value                                       \n  Accu\u2026         -439              -427        \n  amor\u2026                                       \n  Net                                         \n  carr\u2026           46                59        \n  value                                       \n  Total                                       \n  gross        3,720             3,711        \n  carr\u2026                                       \n  value                                       \n  Total                                       \n  accu\u2026       -1,799            -1,702        \n  amor\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  net      $   1,921        $    2,009        \n  carr\u2026                                       \n  value                                       \n                                              \nDuring the six months\nended June 2023, the\namount of intangible\nassets acquired by the\nfirm was notmaterial.\nThe firm acquired\napproximately $\n1.79billion of\nidentifiable\nintangible assets\n(with a weighted\naverage amortization\nperiod of 13years)\nduring 2022,\nsubstantially all in\nconnection with the\nacquisitions of\nGreenSky and NNIP.\nSubstantially all of\nthese identifiable\nintangible assets\nconsisted of customer\nlists and merchant\nrelationships.\nSubstantially all of\nthe firm\u2019s\nidentifiable\nintangible assets have\nfinite useful lives\nand are amortized over\ntheir estimated useful\nlives generally using\nthe straight-line\nmethod.\n                                           \n  57    Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

For leases\nlonger than one year,\nthe firm recognizes a\nright-of-use asset\nrepresenting the right\nto use the underlying\nasset for the lease\nterm, and a lease\nliability representing\nthe liability to make\npayments. The lease\nterm is generally\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual\nmaturity of the lease.\nFor leases where the\nfirm has the option to\nterminate or extend\nthe lease, an\nassessment of the\nlikelihood of\nexercising the option\nis incorporated into\nthe determination of\nthe lease term. Such\nassessment is\ninitially performed at\nthe inception of the\nlease and is updated\nif events occur that\nimpact the original\nassessment.\nAn operating lease\nright-of-use asset is\ninitially determined\nbased on the operating\nlease liability,\nadjusted for initial\ndirect costs, lease\nincentives and amounts\npaid at or prior to\nlease commencement.\nThis amount is then\namortized over the\nlease term.Right-of-\nuse assets and\noperating lease\nliabilities recognized\n(in non-cash\ntransactions for\nleases entered into or\nassumed) by the firm\nwere $ 43million for\nthe three months ended\nJune 2023, $ 49million\nfor the three months\nended June 2022, $\n81million for the six\nmonths ended June 2023\nand $ 116million for\nthe six months ended\nJune 2022.

Note 16. Securitization\nActivities The firm securitizes residential\nand commercial mortgages, corporate bonds,\nloans and other types of financial assets by\nselling these assets to securitization\nvehicles (e.g., trusts, corporate entities and\nlimited liability companies) or through a\nresecuritization. The firm acts as underwriter\nof the beneficial interests that are sold to\ninvestors. The firm\u2019s residential mortgage\nsecuritizations are primarily in connection\nwith government agency securitizations. The\nfirm accounts for a securitization as a sale\nwhen it has relinquished control over the\ntransferred financial assets. Prior to\nsecuritization, the firm generally accounts\nfor assets pending transfer at fair value and\ntherefore does not typically recognize\nsignificant gains or losses upon the transfer\nof assets. Net revenues from underwriting\nactivities are recognized in connection with\nthe sales of the underlying beneficial\ninterests to investors. The firm generally\nreceives cash in exchange for the transferred\nassets but may also have continuing\ninvolvement with the transferred financial\nassets, including ownership of beneficial\ninterests in securitized financial assets,\nprimarily in the form of debt instruments. The\nfirm may also purchase senior or subordinated\nsecurities issued by securitization vehicles\n(which are typically VIEs) in connection with\nsecondary market-making activities.\n                                           \n  63    Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Expected credit\nloss assumptions are\nreflected in the\ndiscount rate for the\nremainder of retained\ninterests.\nThe firm has other retained interests not\nreflected in the table above with a fair value\nof $ 577million and a weighted average life of\n6.1years as of June 2023, and a fair value of\n$ 384million and a weighted average life of\n6.4years as of December 2022. Due to the\nnature and fair value of certain of these\nretained interests, the weighted average\nassumptions for constant prepayment and\ndiscount rates and the related sensitivity to\nadverse changes are not meaningful as of both\nJune 2023 and December 2022. The firm\u2019s\nmaximum exposure to adverse changes in the\nvalue of these interests is the carrying value\nof $ 592million as of June 2023 and $\n398million as of December 2022.\n\nNote 17. Variable Interest Entities A variable\ninterest in a VIE is an investment (e.g., debt\nor equity) or other interest (e.g.,\nderivatives or loans and lending commitments)\nthat will absorb portions of the VIE\u2019s\nexpected losses and/or receive portions of the\nVIE\u2019s expected residual returns. The firm\u2019s\nvariable interests in VIEs include senior and\nsubordinated debt; loans and lending\ncommitments; limited and general partnership\ninterests; preferred and common equity;\nderivatives that may include foreign currency,\nequity and/or credit risk; guarantees; and\ncertain of the fees the firm receives from\ninvestment funds. Certain interest rate,\nforeign currency and credit derivatives the\nfirm enters into with VIEs are not variable\ninterests because they create, rather than\nabsorb, risk. VIEs generally finance the\npurchase of assets by issuing debt and equity\nsecurities that are either collateralized by\nor indexed to the assets held by the VIE. The\ndebt and equity securities issued by a VIE may\ninclude tranches of varying levels of\nsubordination. The firm\u2019s involvement with\nVIEs includes securitization of financial\nassets, as described in Note 16, and\ninvestments in and loans to other types of\nVIEs, as described below. See Note 3 for the\nfirm\u2019s consolidation policies, including the\ndefinition of a VIE. VIE Consolidation\nAnalysis The enterprise with a controlling\nfinancial interest in a VIE is known as the\nprimary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE.\nThe firm determines whether it is the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis\nthat principally considers: \u2022 Which variable\ninterest holder has the power to direct the\nactivities of the VIE that most significantly\nimpact the VIE\u2019s economic performance; \u2022 Which\nvariable interest holder has the obligation to\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits\nfrom the VIE that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE; \u2022 The VIE\u2019s purpose\nand design, including the risks the VIE was\ndesigned to create and pass through to its\nvariable interest holders; \u2022 The VIE\u2019s capital\nstructure; \u2022 The terms between the VIE and its\nvariable interest holders and other parties\ninvolved with the VIE; and \u2022 Related-party\nrelationships. The firm reassesses its\nevaluation of whether an entity is a VIE when\ncertain reconsideration events occur. The firm\nreassesses its determination of whether it is\nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing\nbasis based on current facts and\ncircumstances.\n                                           \n  65    Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm\npurchases and sells\nbeneficial interests\nissued by mortgage-\nbacked VIEs in\nconnection with\nmarket-making\nactivities. In\naddition, the firm may\nenter into derivatives\nwith certain of these\nVIEs, primarily\ninterest rate swaps,\nwhich are typically\nnot variable\ninterests. The firm\ngenerally enters into\nderivatives with other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk.\nReal Estate, Credit-\nand Power-Related and\nOther Investing VIEs.\nThe firm purchases\nequity and debt\nsecurities issued by\nand makes loans to\nVIEs that hold real\nestate, performing and\nnonperforming debt,\ndistressed loans,\npower-related assets\nand equity securities.\nThe firm generally\ndoes not sell assets\nto, or enter into\nderivatives with,\nthese VIEs. Corporate\nDebt and Other Asset-\nBacked VIEs. The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue notes to\nclients, purchases and\nsells beneficial\ninterests issued by\ncorporate debt and\nother asset-backed\nVIEs in connection\nwith market-making\nactivities, and makes\nloans to VIEs that\nwarehouse corporate\ndebt. Certain of these\nVIEs synthetically\ncreate the exposure\nfor the beneficial\ninterests they issue\nby entering into\ncredit derivatives\nwith the firm, rather\nthan purchasing the\nunderlying assets. In\naddition, the firm may\nenter into\nderivatives, such as\ntotal return swaps,\nwith certain corporate\ndebt and other asset-\nbacked VIEs, under\nwhich the firm pays\nthe VIE a return due\nto the beneficial\ninterest holders and\nreceives the return on\nthe collateral owned\nby the VIE. The\ncollateral owned by\nthese VIEs is\nprimarily other asset-\nbacked loans and\nsecurities. The firm\nmay be removed as the\ntotal return swap\ncounterparty and may\nenter into derivatives\nwith other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk\nrelated to these\nswaps. The firm may\nsell assets to the\ncorporate debt and\nother asset-backed\nVIEs it structures.\nPrincipal-Protected\nNote VIEs. The firm\nstructures VIEs that\nissue principal-\nprotected notes to\nclients. These VIEs\nown portfolios of\nassets, principally\nwith exposure to hedge\nfunds. Substantially\nall of the principal\nprotection on the\nnotes issued by these\nVIEs is provided by\nthe asset portfolio\nrebalancing that is\nrequired under the\nterms of the notes.\nThe firm enters into\ntotal return swaps\nwith these VIEs under\nwhich the firm pays\nthe VIE the return due\nto the principal-\nprotected note holders\nand receives the\nreturn on the assets\nowned by the VIE. The\nfirm may enter into\nderivatives with other\ncounterparties to\nmitigate its risk. The\nfirm also obtains\nfunding through these\nVIEs.\n\nInvestments in Funds.\nThe firm makes equity\ninvestments in certain\ninvestment fund VIEs\nit manages and is\nentitled to receive\nfees from these VIEs.\nThe firm has generally\nnot sold assets to, or\nentered into\nderivatives with,\nthese VIEs.\nNonconsolidated VIEs\nThe table below presents a summary of the\nnonconsolidated VIEs in which the firm holds\nvariable interests.\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  mill\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  nonc\u2026               June            Decem\u2026  \n  VIEs         As of  2023            2022    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Asse\u2026                                       \n  in       $  199,1\u2026        $  181,\u2026          \n  VIEs                                        \n  Carr\u2026                                       \n  value                                       \n  of                                          \n  vari\u2026    $  14,608        $  12,3\u2026          \n  inte\u2026                                       \n  \u2014                                           \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Carr\u2026                                       \n  value                                       \n  of                                          \n  vari\u2026    $   1,046        $    659          \n  inte\u2026                                       \n  \u2014                                           \n  liab\u2026                                       \n  Maxi\u2026                                       \n  expo\u2026                                       \n  to                                          \n  loss:                                       \n  Reta\u2026    $   4,900        $  5,043          \n  inte\u2026                                       \n  Purc\u2026          917             861          \n  inte\u2026                                       \n  Comm\u2026                                       \n  and          3,155           3,087          \n  guar\u2026                                       \n  Deri\u2026        8,451           8,802          \n  Debt                                        \n  and          8,418           6,026          \n  equi\u2026                                       \n  Total    $  25,841        $  23,8\u2026          \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n\u2022 The nature of the firm\u2019s variable interests\nis described in the rows under maximum\nexposure to loss.\n\u2022 The firm\u2019s exposure to the obligations of\nVIEs is generally limited to its interests in\nthese entities.

See the tables in\n\u201cCommitments\u201d above for a summary of the\nfirm\u2019s commitments.\n\u2022 The carrying value\nfor derivatives\nincluded derivative\nassets of $ 347million\nas of June 2023 and $\n578million as of\nDecember 2022, and\nderivative liabilities\nof $ 6.98billion as of\nJune 2023 and $\n8.06billion as of\nDecember 2022.\nDerivative Guarantees.\nThe firm enters into\nvarious derivatives\nthat meet the\ndefinition of a\nguarantee under U.S.\nGAAP, including\nwritten equity and\ncommodity put options,\nwritten currency\ncontracts and interest\nrate caps, floors and\nswaptions. These\nderivatives are risk\nmanaged together with\nderivatives that do\nnot meet the\ndefinition of a\nguarantee, and\ntherefore the amounts\nin the table above do\nnot reflect the firm\u2019s\noverall risk related\nto derivative\nactivities.\nDisclosures about\nderivatives are not\nrequired if they may\nbe cash settled and\nthe firm has no basis\nto conclude it is\nprobable that the\ncounterparties held\nthe underlying\ninstruments at the\ninception of the\ncontract. The firm has\nconcluded that these\nconditions have been\nmet for certain large,\ninternationally active\ncommercial and\ninvestment bank\ncounterparties,\ncentral clearing\ncounterparties, hedge\nfunds and certain\nother counterparties.\nAccordingly, the firm\nhas not included such\ncontracts in the table\nabove. See Note 7 for\ninformation about\ncredit derivatives\nthat meet the\ndefinition of a\nguarantee, which are\nnot included in the\ntable above.\nDerivatives are\naccounted for at fair\nvalue and therefore\nthe carrying value is\nconsidered the best\nindication of\npayment/performance\nrisk for individual\ncontracts. However,\nthe carrying values in\nthe table above\nexclude the effect of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting.\nSecurities Lending and\nClearing Guarantees .\nSecurities lending and\nclearing guarantees\ninclude the\nindemnifications and\nguarantees that the\nfirm provides in its\ncapacity as an agency\nlender and in its\ncapacity as a\nsponsoring member of\nthe Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation.\nAs an agency lender,\nthe firm indemnifies\nmost of its securities\nlending customers\nagainst losses\nincurred in the event\nthat borrowers do not\nreturn securities and\nthe collateral held is\ninsufficient to cover\nthe market value of\nthe securities\nborrowed.The maximum\npayout of such\nindemnifications was $\n13.43billion as of\nJune 2023 and $\n12.23billion as of\nDecember 2022.\nCollateral held by the\nlenders in connection\nwith securities\nlending\nindemnifications was $\n13.92billion as of\nJune 2023 and $\n12.62billion as of\nDecember 2022. Because\nthe contractual nature\nof these arrangements\nrequires the firm to\nobtain collateral with\na market value that\nexceeds the value of\nthe securities lent to\nthe borrower, there is\nminimal performance\nrisk associated with\nthese\nindemnifications.\n                                           \n  Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q    70  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n(Unaudited)\n\nAs a sponsoring member of the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation, the firm guarantees the\nperformance of its sponsored member clients to\nthe Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in\nconnection with certain resale and repurchase\nagreements. To minimize potential losses on\nsuch guarantees, the firm obtains a security\ninterest in the collateral that the sponsored\nclient placed with the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. Therefore, the risk of loss on\nsuch guarantees is minimal. The maximum payout\non this guarantee was $ 12.80billion as of\nJune 2023 and $ 8.74billion as of December\n2022. The related collateral held was $\n12.80billion as of June 2023 and $ 8.70billion\nas of December 2022. Other Financial\nGuarantees . In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, the firm provides other financial\nguarantees of the obligations of third parties\n(e.g., standby letters of credit and other\nguarantees to enable clients to complete\ntransactions and fund-related guarantees).\nThese guarantees represent obligations to make\npayments to beneficiaries if the guaranteed\nparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a\ncontractual arrangement with that\nbeneficiary.Other financial guarantees also\ninclude a guarantee that the firm has provided\nto the Government of Malaysia that it will\nreceive, by August 2025, at least $ 1.4billion\nin assets and proceeds from assets seized by\ngovernmental authorities around the world\nrelated to 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a\nsovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB). In\nconnection with this guarantee, the firm is\nalso required to make a one-time interim\npayment of $ 250million towards the $\n1.4billion if the Government of Malaysia has\nnot received at least $ 500million in assets\nand proceeds by August 2022. The firm\nconsiders semi-annual reports and other\ncommunications from Malaysia in evaluating the\nprogress of Malaysia\u2019s recovery efforts. The\nfirm and the Government of Malaysia disagree\nabout and, following an extension of the\ncontractual dispute resolution period,\ncontinue to discuss whether the Government of\nMalaysia did, in fact, recover at least $\n500million as of August 2022 and whether any\ninterim payment was due. If the parties are\nunable to resolve this dispute, it would be\nsettled by arbitration. Any amounts paid by\nthe firm would, in any event, be subject to\nreimbursement in the event the assets and\nproceeds received by the Government of\nMalaysia through August 18, 2028 exceed $\n1.4billion. See Note 27 for further\ninformation about matters related to 1MDB.\nGuarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts. The\nfirm has established trusts, including Goldman\nSachs Capital I, Goldman Sachs Capital II and\nGoldman Sachs Capital III (the Trusts), and\nother entities, for the limited purpose of\nissuing securities to third parties, lending\nthe proceeds to the firm and entering into\ncontractual arrangements with the firm and\nthird parties related to this purpose. The\nfirm does not consolidate these entities. See\nNotes 14 and 19 for further information about\nthe transactions involving the Trusts. The\nfirm effectively provides for the full and\nunconditional guarantee of the securities\nissued by these entities. Timely payment by\nthe firm of amounts due to these entities\nunder the guarantee, borrowing, preferred\nstock and related contractual arrangements\nwill be sufficient to cover payments due on\nthe securities issued by these entities. No\nsubsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the\nsecurities of the Trusts. Management believes\nthat it is unlikely that any circumstances\nwill occur, such as nonperformance on the part\nof paying agents or other service providers,\nthat would make it necessary for the firm to\nmake payments related to these entities other\nthan those required under the terms of the\nguarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and\nrelated contractual arrangements and in\nconnection with certain expenses incurred by\nthese entities. Indemnities and Guarantees of\nService Providers. In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, the firm indemnifies and guarantees\ncertain service providers, such as clearing\nand custody agents, trustees and\nadministrators, against specified potential\nlosses in connection with their acting as an\nagent of, or providing services to, the firm\nor its affiliates. The firm may also be liable\nto some clients or other parties for losses\narising from its custodial role or caused by\nacts or omissions of third-party service\nproviders, including sub-custodians and third-\nparty brokers. In certain cases, the firm has\nthe right to seek indemnification from these\nthird-party service providers for certain\nrelevant losses incurred by the firm. In\naddition, the firm is a member of payment,\nclearing and settlement networks, as well as\nsecurities exchanges around the world that may\nrequire the firm to meet the obligations of\nsuch networks and exchanges in the event of\nmember defaults and other loss scenarios. In\nconnection with the firm\u2019s prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear\nand settle transactions entered into by\nclients with other brokerage firms. The firm\u2019s\nobligations in respect of such transactions\nare secured by the assets in the client\u2019s\naccount and proceeds received from the\ntransactions cleared and settled by the firm\non behalf of the client. In connection with\njoint venture investments, the firm may issue\nloan guarantees under which it may be liable\nin the event of fraud, misappropriation,\nenvironmental liabilities and other matters\ninvolving the borrower.\n                                           \n  71    Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Other\nRepresentations,\nWarranties and\nIndemnifications. The\nfirm provides\nrepresentations and\nwarranties to\ncounterparties in\nconnection with a\nvariety of commercial\ntransactions and\noccasionally\nindemnifies them\nagainst potential\nlosses caused by the\nbreach of those\nrepresentations and\nwarranties. The firm\nmay also provide\nindemnifications\nprotecting against\nchanges in or adverse\napplication of certain\nU.S. tax laws in\nconnection with\nordinary-course\ntransactions, such as\nsecurities issuances,\nborrowings or\nderivatives. In\naddition, the firm may\nprovide\nindemnifications to\nsome counterparties to\nprotect them in the\nevent additional taxes\nare owed or payments\nare withheld, due\neither to a change in\nor an adverse\napplication of certain\nnon-U.S. tax laws.\nThese indemnifications\ngenerally are standard\ncontractual terms and\nare entered into in\nthe ordinary course of\nbusiness. Generally,\nthere are no stated or\nnotional amounts\nincluded in these\nindemnifications, and\nthe contingencies\ntriggering the\nobligation to\nindemnify are not\nexpected to occur. The\nfirm is unable to\ndevelop an estimate of\nthe maximum payout\nunder these guarantees\nand indemnifications.\nHowever, management\nbelieves that it is\nunlikely the firm will\nhave to make any\nmaterial payments\nunder these\narrangements, and no\nmaterial liabilities\nrelated to these\narrangements have been\nrecognized in the\nconsolidated balance\nsheets as of both June\n2023 and December\n2022. Guarantees of\nSubsidiaries. Group\nInc. is the entity\nthat fully and\nunconditionally\nguarantees the\nsecurities issued by\nGS Finance Corp., a\nwholly-owned finance\nsubsidiary of the\nfirm. Group Inc. has\nguaranteed the payment\nobligations of Goldman\nSachs & Co. LLC\n(GS&Co.), GS Bank USA\nand Goldman Sachs\nParis Inc. et Cie,\nsubject to certain\nexceptions. In\naddition, Group Inc.\nhas provided\nguarantees to Goldman\nSachs International\n(GSI) and GSBE related\nto agreements that\neach entity has\nentered into with\ncertain of its\ncounterparties. Group\nInc. guarantees many\nof the obligations of\nits other consolidated\nsubsidiaries on a\ntransaction-by-\ntransaction basis, as\nnegotiated with\ncounterparties.

The firm is\nsubject to\nconsolidated\nregulatory capital\nrequirements which are\ncalculated in\naccordance with the\nregulations of the FRB\n(Capital Framework).\nThe capital\nrequirements are\nexpressed as risk-\nbased capital and\nleverage ratios that\ncompare measures of\nregulatory capital to\nrisk-weighted assets\n(RWAs), average assets\nand off-balance sheet\nexposures. Failure to\ncomply with these\ncapital requirements\nwould result in\nrestrictions being\nimposed by the firm\u2019s\nregulators and could\nlimit the firm\u2019s\nability to repurchase\nshares, pay dividends\nand make certain\ndiscretionary\ncompensation payments.\nThe firm\u2019s capital\nlevels are also\nsubject to qualitative\njudgments by the\nregulators about\ncomponents of capital,\nrisk weightings and\nother factors.\nFurthermore, certain\nof the firm\u2019s\nsubsidiaries are\nsubject to separate\nregulations and\ncapital requirements.\nCapital Framework The\nregulations under the\nCapital Framework are\nlargely based on the\nBasel Committee on\nBanking Supervision\u2019s\n(Basel Committee)\ncapital framework for\nstrengthening\ninternational capital\nstandards (Basel III)\nand also implement\ncertain provisions of\nthe Dodd-Frank Act.\nUnder the Capital\nFramework, the firm is\nan \u201cAdvanced\napproaches\u201d banking\norganization and has\nbeen designated as a\nglobal systemically\nimportant bank\n(G-SIB). The Capital\nFramework includes the\nminimum risk-based\ncapital and the\ncapital conservation\nbuffer requirements.\nThe buffer must\nconsist entirely of\ncapital that qualifies\nas Common Equity Tier\n1 (CET1) capital. The\nfirm calculates its\nCET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital and Total\ncapital ratios in\naccordance with both\nthe Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital\nRules. Each of the\nratios calculated\nunder the Standardized\nand Advanced Capital\nRules must meet its\nrespective capital\nrequirements. Under\nthe Capital Framework,\nthe firm is also\nsubject to leverage\nrequirements which\nconsist of a minimum\nTier 1 leverage ratio\nand a minimum\nsupplementary leverage\nratio (SLR), as well\nas the SLR buffer.\n\nConsolidated\nRegulatory Capital\nRequirements\nRisk-Based Capital\nRatios.

These\nrequirements also\ninclude the capital\nconservation buffer\nrequirements,\nconsisting of the\nG-SIB surcharge\n(Method 2) of 3.0% as\nof June 2023 and 2.5%\nas of December 2022\nand the\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer, which\nthe FRB has set to\nzero percent. In\naddition, the capital\nconservation buffer\nrequirements include\nthe stress capital\nbuffer (SCB) of 6.3%\nunder the Standardized\nCapital Rules and a\nbuffer of 2.5% under\nthe Advanced Capital\nRules.\n\n\u2022 The G-SIB surcharge\nis updated annually\nbased on financial\ndata from the prior\nyear and is generally\napplicable for the\nfollowing year. The\nG-SIB surcharge is\ncalculated using two\nmethodologies, the\nhigher of which is\nreflected in the\nfirm\u2019s risk-based\ncapital requirements.\nThe first calculation\n(Method 1) is based on\nthe Basel Committee\u2019s\nmethodology which,\namong other factors,\nrelies upon measures\nof the size, activity\nand complexity of each\nG-SIB. The second\ncalculation (Method 2)\nuses similar inputs\nbut includes a measure\nof reliance on short-\nterm wholesale\nfunding.\n\nBased on the firm's\n2023 Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and\nReview submission, the\nFRB reduced the firm's\nSCB from 6.3% to 5.5%\nfor the period from\nOctober 1, 2023\nthrough September 30,\n2024. As a result,\nbeginning on October\n1, 2023, the firm's\nStandardized\nrequirements will be\n13.0% for the CET1\ncapital ratio, 14.5%\nfor the Tier 1 capital\nratio and 16.5% for\nthe Total capital\nratio.\n                                           \n  75    Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

For\nrisk management\npurposes, a 95% one-\ndayVaR is used,\nwhereas for regulatory\ncapital requirements,\na 99% 10-dayVaR is\nused to determine\nMarket RWAs and a 99%\none-dayVaR is used to\ndetermine regulatory\nVaR exceptions. In\naddition, the daily\nnet revenues used to\ndetermine risk\nmanagement VaR\nexceptions (i.e.,\ncomparing the daily\nnet revenues to the\nVaR measure calculated\nas of the end of the\nprior business day)\ninclude intraday\nactivity, whereas the\nCapital Framework\nrequires that intraday\nactivity be excluded\nfrom daily net\nrevenues when\ncalculating regulatory\nVaR exceptions.\nIntraday activity\nincludes bid/offer net\nrevenues, which are\nmore likely than not\nto be positive by\ntheir nature. As a\nresult, there may be\ndifferences in the\nnumber of VaR\nexceptions and the\namount of daily net\nrevenues calculated\nfor regulatory VaR\ncompared to the\namounts calculated for\nrisk management VaR.\nThe firm\u2019s positional\nlosses observed on a\nsingle day exceeded\nits 99% one-\ndayregulatory VaR on\none occasion during\nboth the six months\nended June 2023 and\nthe year ended 2022.\nThere was no change in\nthe firm\u2019s VaR\nmultiplier used to\ncalculate Market RWAs;\n\u2022 Stressed VaR is the\npotential loss in\nvalue of trading\nassets and\nliabilities, as well\nas certain\ninvestments, loans,\nand other financial\nassets and liabilities\naccounted for at fair\nvalue, during a period\nof significant market\nstress; \u2022 Incremental\nrisk is the potential\nloss in value of non-\nsecuritized positions\ndue to the default or\ncredit migration of\nissuers of financial\ninstruments over a\none-year time horizon;\n\u2022 Comprehensive risk\nis the potential loss\nin value, due to price\nrisk and defaults,\nwithin the firm\u2019s\ncredit correlation\npositions; and \u2022\nSpecific risk is the\nrisk of loss on a\nposition that could\nresult from factors\nother than broad\nmarket movements,\nincluding event risk,\ndefault risk and\nidiosyncratic risk.\nThe standardized\nmeasurement method is\nused to determine\nspecific risk RWAs, by\napplying supervisory\ndefined risk-weighting\nfactors after\napplicable netting is\nperformed.\n\nOperational Risk\nOperational RWAs are\nonly required to be\nincluded under the\nAdvanced Capital\nRules.

GS\nBank USA is an\nAdvanced approaches\nbanking organization\nunder the Capital\nFramework. The\ndeposits of GS Bank\nUSA are insured by the\nFDIC to the extent\nprovided by law. The\nCapital Framework\nincludes the minimum\nrisk-based capital and\nthe capital\nconservation buffer\nrequirements\n(consisting of a 2.5%\nbuffer and the\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer). The\nbuffer must consist\nentirely of capital\nthat qualifies as CET1\ncapital. In addition,\nthe Capital Framework\nincludes the leverage\nratio requirement. GS\nBank USA is required\nto calculate the CET1\ncapital, Tier 1\ncapital and Total\ncapital ratios in\naccordance with both\nthe Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital\nRules. The lower of\neach risk-based\ncapital ratio under\nthe Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules\nis the ratio against\nwhich GS Bank USA\u2019s\ncompliance with its\nrisk-based capital\nrequirements is\nassessed.

Income Taxes Provision for Income\nTaxes Income taxes are provided for using the\nasset and liability method under which\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities are\nrecognized for temporary differences between\nthe financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities. The firm reports\ninterest expense related to income tax matters\nin provision for taxes and income tax\npenalties in other expenses. Deferred Income\nTaxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net\ntax effects of temporary differences between\nthe financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities. These temporary\ndifferences result in taxable or deductible\namounts in future years and are measured using\nthe tax rates and laws that will be in effect\nwhen such differences are expected to reverse.\nValuation allowances are established to reduce\ndeferred tax assets to the amount that more\nlikely than not will be realized and primarily\nrelate to the ability to utilize losses in\nvarious tax jurisdictions. Tax assets are\nincluded in other assets and tax liabilities\nare included in other liabilities.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits The firm recognizes\ntax positions in the consolidated financial\nstatements only when it is more likely than\nnot that the position will be sustained on\nexamination by the relevant taxing authority\nbased on the technical merits of the position.\nA position that meets this standard is\nmeasured at the largest amount of benefit that\nwill more likely than not be realized on\nsettlement. A liability is established for\ndifferences between positions taken in a tax\nreturn and amounts recognized in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Regulatory\nTax Examinations The firm is subject to\nexamination by the U.S. Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) and other taxing authorities in\njurisdictions where the firm has significant\nbusiness operations, such as the United\nKingdom, Japan, Hong Kong and various states,\nsuch as New York. The tax years under\nexamination vary by jurisdiction. The firm\ndoes not expect completion of these audits to\nhave a material impact on the firm\u2019s financial\ncondition, but it may be material to operating\nresults for a particular period, depending, in\npart, on the operating results for that\nperiod.\n                                           \n  Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q    84  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Business Segments The firm manages\nand reports its activities in threebusiness\nsegments: Global Banking & Markets, Asset &\nWealth Management and Platform Solutions. See\nNote 1 for information about the firm\u2019s\nbusiness segments. Compensation and benefits\nexpenses in the firm\u2019s segments reflect, among\nother factors, the overall performance of the\nfirm, as well as the performance of individual\nbusinesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in\none segment of the firm\u2019s business may be\nsignificantly affected by the performance of\nthe firm\u2019s other business segments. The firm\nallocates assets (including allocations of\nglobal core liquid assets and cash, secured\nclient financing and other assets), revenues\nand expenses among the threebusiness segments.\nDue to the integrated nature of these\nsegments, estimates and judgments are made in\nallocating certain assets, revenues and\nexpenses. The allocation process is based on\nthe manner in which management currently views\nthe performance of the segments. The\nallocation of common shareholders\u2019 equity and\npreferred stock dividends to each segment is\nbased on the estimated amount of equity\nrequired to support the activities of the\nsegment under relevant regulatory capital\nrequirements. Net earnings for each segment is\ncalculated by applying the firmwide tax rate\nto each segment\u2019s pre-tax earnings.

These\nactivities expose the\nfirm to many different\nindustries and\ncounterparties, and\nmay also subject the\nfirm to a\nconcentration of\ncredit risk to a\nparticular central\nbank, counterparty,\nborrower or issuer,\nincluding sovereign\nissuers, or to a\nparticular\nclearinghouse or\nexchange. The firm\nseeks to mitigate\ncredit risk by\nactively monitoring\nexposures and\nobtaining collateral\nfrom counterparties as\ndeemed appropriate.\nThe firm measures and\nmonitors its credit\nexposure based on\namounts owed to the\nfirm after taking into\naccount risk mitigants\nthat the firm\nconsiders when\ndetermining credit\nrisk. Such risk\nmitigants include\nnetting and collateral\narrangements and\neconomic hedges, such\nas credit derivatives,\nfutures and forward\ncontracts. Netting and\ncollateral agreements\npermit the firm to\noffset receivables and\npayables with such\ncounterparties and/or\nenable the firm to\nobtain collateral on\nan upfront or\ncontingent basis.\nThe table below\npresents the credit\nconcentrations\nincluded in trading\ncash instruments and\ninvestments.\n                                              \n  $ in                June            Decem\u2026  \n  mill\u2026        As of  2023            2022    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S.                                        \n  gove\u2026                                       \n  and      $  219,9\u2026        $  205,\u2026          \n  agen\u2026                                       \n  obli\u2026                                       \n  Perc\u2026                                       \n  of            14.0  %         14.3  %       \n  total                                       \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Non-\u2026                                       \n  gove\u2026                                       \n  and      $  81,645        $  40,3\u2026          \n  agen\u2026                                       \n  obli\u2026                                       \n  Perc\u2026                                       \n  of             5.2  %          2.8  %       \n  total                                       \n  asse\u2026                                       \n                                              \nIn addition, the firm\nhad $ 230.44billion as\nof June 2023 and $\n208.53billion as of\nDecember 2022 of cash\ndeposits held at\ncentral banks\n(included in cash and\ncash equivalents), of\nwhich $ 124.73billion\nas of June 2023 and $\n165.77billion as of\nDecember 2022 was held\nat the Federal\nReserve.\nAs of both June 2023\nand December 2022, the\nfirm did not have\ncredit exposure to any\nother counterparty\nthat exceeded 2% of\ntotal assets.\nCollateral obtained by\nthe firm related to\nderivative assets is\nprincipally cash and\nis held by the firm or\na third-party\ncustodian.

Note 27.\nLegal Proceedings The firm is involved in a\nnumber of judicial, regulatory and arbitration\nproceedings (including those described below)\nconcerning matters arising in connection with\nthe conduct of the firm\u2019s businesses. Many of\nthese proceedings are in early stages, and\nmany of these cases seek an indeterminate\namount of damages. Under ASC 450, an event is\n\u201creasonably possible\u201d if \u201cthe chance of the\nfuture event or events occurring is more than\nremote but less than likely\u201d and an event is\n\u201cremote\u201d if \u201cthe chance of the future event or\nevents occurring is slight.\u201d Thus, references\nto the upper end of the range of reasonably\npossible loss for cases in which the firm is\nable to estimate a range of reasonably\npossible loss mean the upper end of the range\nof loss for cases for which the firm believes\nthe risk of loss is more than slight.\n\nWith respect to matters described below for\nwhich management has been able to estimate a\nrange of reasonably possible loss where (i)\nactual or potential plaintiffs have claimed an\namount of money damages, (ii) the firm is\nbeing, or threatened to be, sued by purchasers\nin a securities offering and is not being\nindemnified by a party that the firm believes\nwill pay the full amount of any judgment, or\n(iii) the purchasers are demanding that the\nfirm repurchase securities, management has\nestimated the upper end of the range of\nreasonably possible loss based on (a) in the\ncase of (i), the amount of money damages\nclaimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the\ndifference between the initial sales price of\nthe securities that the firm sold in such\noffering and the estimated lowest subsequent\nprice of such securities prior to the action\nbeing commenced and (c) in the case of (iii),\nthe price that purchasers paid for the\nsecurities less the estimated value, if any,\nas of June 2023 of the relevant securities, in\neach of cases (i), (ii) and (iii), taking into\naccount any other factors believed to be\nrelevant to the particular matter or matters\nof that type. As o f the date hereof, the firm\nhas estimated the upper end of the range of\nreasonably possible aggregate loss for such\nmatters and for any other matters described\nbelow where management has been able to\nestimate a range of reasonably possible\naggregate loss to be approximately $\n2.2billion in excess of the aggregate reserves\nfor such matters. Management is generally\nunable to estimate a range of reasonably\npossible loss for matters other than those\nincluded in the estimate above, including\nwhere (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have\nnot claimed an amount of money damages, except\nin those instances where management can\notherwise determine an appropriate amount,\n(ii) matte rs are in early stages, (iii)\nmatters relate to regulatory investigations or\nreviews, except in those instances where\nmanagement can otherwise determine an\nappropriate amount, (iv) there is uncertainty\nas to the likelihood of a class being\ncertified or the ultimate size of the class,\n(v) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of\npending appeals or motions, (vi) there are\nsignificant factual issues to be resolved,\nand/or (vii) there are novel legal issues\npresented. For example, the firm\u2019s potential\nliabilities with respect to the investigations\nand reviews described below in \u201cRegulatory\nInvestigations and Reviews and Related\nLitigation\u201d generally are not included in\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of reasonably possible\nloss. However, management does not believe,\nbased on currently available information, that\nthe outcomes of such other matters will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the firm\u2019s\nfinancial condition, though the outcomes could\nbe material to the firm\u2019s operating results\nfor any particular period, depending, in part,\nupon the operating results for such period.\n                                           \n  Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q    88  \n                                           \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

On November 1, 2018,\nthe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed\na criminal information and guilty plea by Tim\nLeissner, a former participating managing\ndirector of the firm, and an indictment\nagainst Ng Chong Hwa, a former managing\ndirector of the firm. On August 28, 2018,\nLeissner was adjudicated guilty by the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork of conspiring to launder money and to\nviolate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct\u2019s (FCPA) anti-bribery and internal\naccounting controls provisions. Ng was charged\nwith conspiring to launder money and to\nviolate the FCPA\u2019s anti-bribery and internal\naccounting controls provisions, and on April\n8, 2022, Ng was found guilty on all counts\nfollowing a trial. On August 18, 2020, the\nfirm announced that it entered into a\nsettlement agreement with the Government of\nMalaysia to resolve the criminal and\nregulatory proceedings in Malaysia involving\nthe firm, which includes a guarantee that the\nGovernment of Malaysia receives at least $\n1.4billion in assets and proceeds from assets\nseized by governmental authorities around the\nworld related to 1MDB. See Note 18 for further\ninformation about this guarantee. On October\n22, 2020, the firm announced that it reached\nsettlements of governmental and regulatory\ninvestigations relating to 1MDB with the DOJ,\nthe SEC, the FRB, the NYDFS, the FCA, the PRA,\nthe Singapore Attorney General\u2019s Chambers, the\nSingapore Commercial Affairs Department, the\nMonetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong\nKong Securities and Futures Commission. Group\nInc. entered into a three-year deferred\nprosecution agreement with the DOJ, in which a\ncharge against the firm, one count of\nconspiracy to violate the FCPA, was filed and\nwill later be dismissed if the firm abides by\nthe terms of the agreement. In addition, GS\nMalaysia pleaded guilty to one count of\nconspiracy to violate the FCPA, and was\nsentenced on June 9, 2021. In May 2021, the\nU.S. Department of Labor granted the firm a\nfive-year exemption to maintain its status as\na qualified professional asset manager (QPAM).\nOn December 20, 2018, a putative securities\nclass action lawsuit was filed in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of\nNew York against Group Inc. and certain former\nofficers of the firm alleging violations of\nthe anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act\nwith respect to Group Inc.\u2019s disclosures and\npublic statements concerning 1MDB and seeking\nunspecified damages.

The use of\nfair value to measure\nfinancial instruments\nis fundamental to our\nrisk management\npractices and is our\nmost critical\naccounting policy.\n\nThe fair value of a\nfinancial instrument\nis the amount that\nwould be received to\nsell an asset or paid\nto transfer a\nliability in an\norderly transaction\nbetween market\nparticipants at the\nmeasurement date. We\nmeasure certain\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities as a\nportfolio (i.e., based\non its net exposure to\nmarket and/or credit\nrisks). In determining\nfair value, the\nhierarchy under U.S.\ngenerally accepted\naccounting principles\n(U.S. GAAP) gives (i)\nthe highest priority\nto unadjusted quoted\nprices in active\nmarkets for identical,\nunrestricted assets or\nliabilities (level 1\ninputs), (ii) the next\npriority to inputs\nother than level 1\ninputs that are\nobservable, either\ndirectly or indirectly\n(level 2 inputs), and\n(iii) the lowest\npriority to inputs\nthat cannot be\nobserved in market\nactivity (level 3\ninputs). In evaluating\nthe significance of a\nvaluation input, we\nconsider, among other\nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s\nnet risk exposure to\nthat input. Assets and\nliabilities are\nclassified in their\nentirety based on the\nlowest level of input\nthat is significant to\ntheir fair value\nmeasurement.\n\nThe fair values for\nsubstantially all of\nour financial assets\nand liabilities are\nbased on observable\nprices and inputs and\nare classified in\nlevels 1 and 2 of the\nfair value hierarchy.\nCertain level 2 and\nlevel 3 financial\nassets and liabilities\nmay require\nappropriate valuation\nadjustments that a\nmarket participant\nwould require to\narrive at fair value\nfor factors, such as\ncounterparty and our\ncredit quality,\nfunding risk, transfer\nrestrictions,\nliquidity and\nbid/offer spreads.\n\nInstruments classified\nin level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy are\nthose which require\none or more\nsignificant inputs\nthat are not\nobservable. Level 3\nfinancial assets\nrepresented 1.7% as of\nboth June 2023 and\nMarch 2023, and 1.8%\nas of December 2022 of\nour total assets. See\nNotes 4 and 5 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about\nlevel 3 financial\nassets, including\nchanges in level 3\nfinancial assets and\nrelated fair value\nmeasurements. Absent\nevidence to the\ncontrary, instruments\nclassified in level 3\nof the fair value\nhierarchy are\ninitially valued at\ntransaction price,\nwhich is considered to\nbe the best initial\nestimate of fair\nvalue. Subsequent to\nthe transaction date,\nwe use other\nmethodologies to\ndetermine fair value,\nwhich vary based on\nthe type of\ninstrument. Estimating\nthe fair value of\nlevel 3 financial\ninstruments requires\njudgments to be made.\nThese judgments\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 Determining the\nappropriate valuation\nmethodology and/or\nmodel for each type of\nlevel 3 financial\ninstrument;\n\n\u2022 Determining model\ninputs based on an\nevaluation of all\nrelevant empirical\nmarket data, including\nprices evidenced by\nmarket transactions,\ninterest rates, credit\nspreads, volatilities\nand correlations; and\n\n\u2022 Determining\nappropriate valuation\nadjustments, including\nthose related to\nilliquidity or\ncounterparty credit\nquality.\n\nRegardless of the\nmethodology, valuation\ninputs and assumptions\nare only changed when\ncorroborated by\nsubstantive evidence.\n\nControls Over\nValuation of Financial\nInstruments.

In the event\nthat there is a\ndifference of opinion\nin situations where\nestimating the fair\nvalue of financial\ninstruments requires\njudgment (e.g.,\ncalibration to market\ncomparables or trade\ncomparison, as\ndescribed below), the\nfinal valuation\ndecision is made by\nsenior managers in\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions.

The\nexpected life of each\nloan or lending\ncommitment is\ndetermined based on\nthe contractual term\nadjusted for extension\noptions or demand\nfeatures, or is\nmodeled in the case of\nrevolving credit card\nloans. The forecasts\ninclude baseline,\nfavorable and adverse\neconomic scenarios\nover a three-year\nperiod. For loans with\nexpected lives beyond\nthree years, the model\nreverts to historical\nloss information based\non a non-linear\nmodeled approach. We\napply judgment in\nweighting individual\nscenarios each quarter\nbased on a variety of\nfactors, including our\ninternally derived\neconomic outlook,\nmarket consensus,\nrecent macroeconomic\nconditions and\nindustry trends. The\nforecasted economic\nscenarios consider a\nnumber of risk factors\nrelevant to the\nwholesale and consumer\nportfolios. Risk\nfactors for wholesale\nloans include internal\ncredit ratings,\nindustry default and\nloss data, expected\nlife, macroeconomic\nindicators (e.g.,\nunemployment rates and\nGDP), the borrower\u2019s\ncapacity to meet its\nfinancial obligations,\nthe borrower\u2019s country\nof risk and industry,\nloan seniority and\ncollateral type. In\naddition, for loans\nbacked by real estate,\nrisk factors include\nloan-to-value ratio,\ndebt service ratio and\nhome price index. Risk\nfactors for\ninstallment and credit\ncard loans include\nFair Isaac Corporation\n(FICO) credit scores,\ndelinquency status,\nloan vintage and\nmacroeconomic\nindicators.\n\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses also\nincludes qualitative\ncomponents which allow\nmanagement to reflect\nthe uncertain nature\nof economic\nforecasting, capture\nuncertainty regarding\nmodel inputs, and\naccount for model\nimprecision and\nconcentration risk.\n\nOur estimate of credit\nlosses entails\njudgment about\ncollectability at the\nreporting dates, and\nthere are\nuncertainties inherent\nin those judgments.\nThe allowance for\ncredit losses is\nsubject to a\ngovernance process\nthat involves review\nand approval by senior\nmanagement within our\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions. Personnel\nwithin our independent\nrisk oversight and\ncontrol functions are\nresponsible for\nforecasting the\neconomic variables\nthat underlie the\neconomic scenarios\nthat are used in the\nmodeling of expected\ncredit losses. While\nwe use the best\ninformation available\nto determine this\nestimate, future\nadjustments to the\nallowance may be\nnecessary based on,\namong other things,\nchanges in the\neconomic environment\nor variances between\nactual results and the\noriginal assumptions\nused. Loans are\ncharged off against\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses when deemed to\nbe uncollectible.\n\nWe also record an\nallowance for credit\nlosses on lending\ncommitments which are\nheld for investment\nthat are accounted for\nat amortized cost.\nSuch allowance is\ndetermined using the\nsame methodology as\nthe allowance for loan\nlosses, while also\ntaking into\nconsideration the\nprobability of\ndrawdowns or funding,\nand whether such\ncommitments are\ncancellable by us.\n\nTo estimate the\npotential impact of an\nadverse macroeconomic\nenvironment on our\nallowance for credit\nlosses, we, among\nother things, compared\nthe expected credit\nlosses under the\nweighted average\nforecast used in the\ncalculation of\nallowance for credit\nlosses as of June 2023\n(which was weighted\ntowards the baseline\nand adverse economic\nscenarios) to the\nexpected credit losses\nunder a 100% weighted\nadverse economic\nscenario. The adverse\neconomic scenario of\nthe forecast model\nreflects a global\nrecession in the\nsecond half of 2023\nthrough the first half\nof 2024 and a more\naggressive tightening\nof monetary policy by\ncentral banks,\nresulting in an\neconomic contraction\nand rising\nunemployment rates. A\n100% weighting to the\nadverse economic\nscenario would have\nresulted in an\napproximate $0.8\nbillion increase in\nour allowance for\ncredit losses as of\nJune 2023. This\nhypothetical increase\ndoes not take into\nconsideration any\npotential adjustments\nto qualitative\nreserves. The\nforecasts of\nmacroeconomic\nconditions are\ninherently uncertain\nand do not take into\naccount any other\noffsetting or\ncorrelated effects.\nThe actual credit loss\nin an adverse\nmacroeconomic\nenvironment may differ\nsignificantly from\nthis estimate.

In\naddition to the\nestimates we make in\nconnection with fair\nvalue measurements and\nthe allowance for\ncredit losses on loans\nand lending\ncommitments held for\ninvestment and\naccounted for at\namortized cost, the\nuse of estimates and\nassumptions is also\nimportant in\ndetermining\ndiscretionary\ncompensation accruals,\nthe accounting for\ngoodwill and\nidentifiable\nintangible assets,\nprovisions for losses\nthat may arise from\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\n(including\ngovernmental\ninvestigations), and\naccounting for income\ntaxes.\n\nA substantial portion\nof our compensation\nand benefits\nrepresents\ndiscretionary\ncompensation, which is\nfinalized at year-end.\nWe believe the most\nappropriate way to\nallocate estimated\nyear-end discretionary\ncompensation among\ninterim periods is in\nproportion to the net\nrevenues net of\nprovision for credit\nlosses earned in such\nperiods. In addition\nto the level of net\nrevenues net of\nprovision for credit\nlosses, our overall\ncompensation expense\nin any given year is\nalso influenced by,\namong other factors,\noverall financial\nperformance,\nprevailing labor\nmarkets, business mix,\nthe structure of our\nshare-based\ncompensation programs\nand the external\nenvironment.\n                                            \n  109    Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

When assessing\ngoodwill for\nimpairment, first, a\nqualitative assessment\ncan be made to\ndetermine whether it\nis more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of a\nreporting unit is less\nthan its carrying\nvalue. If the results\nof the qualitative\nassessment are not\nconclusive, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest is performed.\nAlternatively, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest can be performed\nwithout performing a\nqualitative\nassessment. Estimating\nthe fair value of our\nreporting units\nrequires judgment.\nCritical inputs to the\nfair value estimates\ninclude projected\nearnings and allocated\nequity. There is\ninherent uncertainty\nin the projected\nearnings. The carrying\nvalue of each\nreporting u nit\nreflects an allocation\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity and represents\nthe estimated amount\nof total shareholders\u2019\nequity required to\nsupport the activities\nof the reporting unit\nunder currently\napplicable regulatory\ncapital requirements.\nIn connection with the\nexploration of a\npotential sale of\nGreenSky, we performed\na quantitative\ngoodwill test and\ndetermined that the\ngoodwill associated\nwith Consumer\nplatforms was\nimpaired, and\naccordingly, recorded\na $504 million\nimpairment in the\nsecond quarter of\n2023. See Note 12 to\nthe consolidated\nfinancial statements\nfor further\ninformation about\ngoodwill. If we\nexperience a prolonged\nor severe period of\nweakness in the\nbusiness environment,\nfinancial markets, the\nperformance of one or\nmore of our reporting\nunits or our common\nstock price, or\nadditional increases\nin capital\nrequirements, our\ngoodwill could be\nimpaired in the\nfuture.\n\nIdentifiable\nintangible assets are\ntested for impairment\nwhen events or changes\nin circumstances\nsuggest that an\nasset\u2019s or asset\ngroup\u2019s carrying value\nmay not be fully\nrecoverable. Judgment\nis required to\nevaluate whether\nindications of\npotential impairment\nhave occurred, and to\ntest identifiable\nintangible assets for\nimpairment, if\nrequired. An\nimpairment is\nrecognized if the\nestimated undiscounted\ncash flows relating to\nthe asset or asset\ngroup is less than the\ncorresponding carrying\nvalue. In connection\nwith the exploration\nof a potential sale of\nGreenSky, we\nquantitatively tested\nGreenSky\u2019s\nidentifiable\nintangible assets for\nimpairment and\ndetermined that these\nassets were not\nimpaired. We will\ncontinue to evaluate\nthese assets to\ndetermine whether an\nimpairment is required\nin the future. The\nidentifiable\nintangible assets\nrelated to GreenSky\nwere approximately\n$625 million as of\nJune 2023 and\napproximately $660\nmillion as of December\n2022. See Note 12 to\nthe consolidated\nfinancial statements\nfor further\ninformation about\nidentifiable\nintangible assets.\n\nWe also estimate and\nprovide for potential\nlosses that may arise\nout of litigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nto the extent that\nsuch losses are\nprobable and can be\nreasonably estimated.\nIn addition, we\nestimate the upper end\nof the range of\nreasonably possible\naggregate loss in\nexcess of the related\nreserves for\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nwhere we believe the\nrisk of loss is more\nthan slight. See Notes\n18 and 27 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for\ninformation about\ncertain judicial,\nlitigation and\nregulatory\nproceedings.\nSignificant judgment\nis required in making\nthese estimates and\nour final liabilities\nmay ultimately be\nmaterially different.\nOur total estimated\nliability in respect\nof litigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nis determined on a\ncase-by-case basis and\nrepresents an estimate\nof probable losses\nafter considering,\namong other factors,\nthe progress of each\ncase, proceeding or\ninvestigation, our\nexperience and the\nexperience of others\nin similar cases,\nproceedings or\ninvestigations, and\nthe opinions and views\nof legal counsel.\n\nIn accounting for\nincome taxes, we\nrecognize tax\npositions in the\nfinancial statements\nonly when it is more\nlikely than not that\nthe pos ition will be\nsustained on\nexamination by the\nrelevant taxing\nauthority based on the\ntechnical merits of\nthe position. We use\nestimates to recognize\ncurrent and deferred\nincome taxes in the\nU.S. federal, state\nand local and non-U.S.\njurisdictions in which\nwe operate. The income\ntax laws in these\njurisdictions are\ncomplex and can be\nsubject to different\ninterpretations\nbetween taxpayers and\ntaxing authorities.\nDisputes may arise\nover these\ninterpretations and\ncan be settled by\naudit, administrative\nappeals or judicial\nproceedings. Our\ninterpretations are\nreevaluated quarterly\nbased on guidance\ncurrently available,\ntax examination\nexperience and the\nopinions of legal\ncounsel, among other\nfactors.

In\nthe U.S., the rate of\nunemployment remained\nlow and the pace of\ngrowth in consumer\nspending declined\ncompared with the\nfirst quarter of 2023.\n\nIf concerns about the\neconomic outlook grow,\nincluding those about\ngeopolitical concerns,\ninflation, the\ncommercial real estate\nsector, and potential\nincreases in\nregulatory\nrequirements, it may\nlead to a decline in\nasset prices, a\nfurther decline in\nmarket-making activity\nlevels, or a continued\ndecline in investment\nbanking activity\nlevels, and net\nrevenues and provision\nfor credit losses\nwould likely be\nnegatively impacted .\nSee \u201cSegment Assets\nand Operating Results\n\u2014 Segment Operating\nResults\u201d for\ninformation about the\noperating environment\nand material trends\nand uncertainties that\nmay impact our results\nof operations.\n\nThree Months Ended\nJune 2023 versus June\n2022.

Our exchange-\nbased market-making\nactivities include\nmaking markets in\nstocks and ETFs,\nfutures and options on\nmajor exchanges\nworldwide.

We provide\nfinancing to our\nclients for their\nsecurities trading\nactivities through\nmargin loans that are\ncollateralized by\nsecurities, cash or\nother acceptable\ncollateral. In\naddition, we execute\nswap transactions to\nprovide our clients\nwith exposure to\nsecurities and\nindices.

In\naddition, we maintain\n(i) market-making\npositions, typically\nfor a short period of\ntime, in response to,\nor in anticipation of,\nclient demand, and\n(ii) positions to\nactively manage our\nrisk exposures that\narise from these\nmarket-making\nactivities\n(collectively,\ninventory). Our\ninventory is recorded\nin trading assets\n(long positions) or\ntrading liabilities\n(short positions) in\nour consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n\nOur results are\ninfluenced by a\ncombination of\ninterconnected\ndrivers, including (i)\nclient activity levels\nand transactional\nbid/offer spreads\n(collectively, client\nactivity), and (ii)\nchanges in the fair\nvalue of our inventory\nand interest income\nand interest expense\nrelated to the\nholding, hedging and\nfunding of our\ninventory\n(collectively, market-\nmaking inventory\nchanges). Due to the\nintegrated nature of\nour market-making\nactivities,\ndisaggregation of net\nrevenues into client\nactivity and market-\nmaking inventory\nchanges is judgmental\nand has inherent\ncomplexities and\nlimitations.\n\nThe amount and\ncomposition of our net\nrevenues vary over\ntime as these drivers\nare impacted by\nmultiple interrelated\nfactors affecting\neconomic and market\nconditions, including\nvolatility and\nliquidity in the\nmarket, changes in\ninterest rates,\ncurrency exchange\nrates, credit spreads,\nequity prices and\ncommodity prices,\ninvestor confidence,\nand other\nmacroeconomic concerns\nand uncertainties.\n\nIn general, assuming\nall other market-\nmaking conditions\nremain constant,\nincreases in client\nactivity levels or\nbid/offer spreads tend\nto result in increases\nin net revenues, and\ndecreases tend to have\nthe opposite effect.\nHowever, changes in\nmarket-making\nconditions can\nmaterially impact\nclient activity levels\nand bid/offer spreads,\nas well as the fair\nvalue of our\ninventory. For\nexample, a decrease in\nliquidity in the\nmarket could have the\nimpact of (i)\nincreasing our\nbid/offer spread, (ii)\ndecreasing investor\nconfidence and thereby\ndecreasing client\nactivity levels, and\n(iii) widening of\ncredit spreads on our\ninventory positions.\n\nOther.

During the\nsecond quarter of 2023, Global Banking &\nMarkets operated in an environment generally\ncharacterized by continued broad macroeconomic\nconcerns, including inflationary concerns,\ngeopolitical tensions and the outlook for\neconomic growth. These factors negatively\naffected industry-wide investment banking\nactivity levels and contributed to a decline\nin market-making activity levels. In\ninvestment banking, industry-wide completed\nmergers and acquisitions transactions\ncontinued to decline from elevated levels in\nthe prior year, while industry-wide equity and\ndebt underwriting volumes remained below\nhistorical averages. In interest rates, the\nyield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes increased\napproximately 35 basis points and the yield on\n10-year U.K. gilts increased approximately 90\nbasis points. In equities, the S&P 500 Index\nincreased by 8% and MSCI World Index increased\nby 6%, compared with the end of the first\nquarter of 2023.\n\nIn the future, if market and economic\nconditions deteriorate further, and activity\nlevels or volatility decline further, or\ncredit spreads related to hedges on our\nrelationship lending portfolio tighten, net\nrevenues in Global Banking & Market would\nlikely be negatively impacted. In addition, if\neconomic conditions deteriorate further or if\nthe creditworthiness of borrowers\ndeteriorates, provision for credit losses\nwould likely be negatively impacted. Three\nMonths Ended June 2023 versus June 2022. Net\nrevenues in Global Banking & Markets were\n$7.19 billion for the second quarter of 2023,\n14% lower than the second quarter of 2022.\nInvestment banking fees were $1.43 billion,\n20% lower than the second quarter of 2022 ,\nprimarily due to significantly lower net\nrevenues in Advisory, reflecting a significant\ndecline in industry-wide completed mergers and\nacquisitions transactions, partially offset by\nsignificantly higher net revenues in Equity\nunderwriting, primarily reflecting a\nsignificant increase in industry-wide volumes.\nAs of June 2023, our Investment banking fees\nbacklog increased compared with March 2023,\nprimarily due to higher estimated net revenues\nfrom potential advisory transactions,\npartially offset by lower estimated net\nrevenues from potential equity underwriting\ntransactions (primarily from initial public\nofferings). Our backlog represents an estimate\nof our net revenues from future transactions\nwhere we believe that future revenue\nrealization is more likely than not. We\nbelieve changes in our backlog may be a useful\nindicator of client activity levels which,\nover the long term, impact our net revenues.\nHowever, the time frame for completion and\ncorresponding revenue recognition of\ntransactions in our backlog varies based on\nthe nature of the assignment, as certain\ntransactions may remain in our backlog for\nlonger periods of time. In addition, our\nbacklog is subject to certain limitations,\nsuch as assumptions about the likelihood that\nindividual client transactions will occur in\nthe future. Transactions may be cancelled or\nmodified, and transactions not included in the\nestimate may also occur. Net revenues in FICC\nwere $2.71 billion, 26% lower than a strong\nsecond quarter of 2022 , primarily reflecting\nsignificantly lower net revenues in FICC\nintermediation, driven by significantly lower\nnet revenues in commodities, interest rate\nproducts and currencies, partially offset by\nsignificantly higher net revenues in mortgages\nand higher net revenues in credit products.\nNet revenues in FICC financing were lower,\nprimarily in commodities financing.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q    118  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

During the\nsecond quarter of\n2023, Asset & Wealth\nManagement operated in\nan environment\ngenerally\ncharacterized by\ncontinued broad\nmacroeconomic\nconcerns, including\nincreased pressure in\nthe commercial real\nestate market.\nHowever, improvements\nin the outlook for\neconomic conditions\ncontributed to an\nincrease in equity\nprices compared with\nthe end of the first\nquarter of 2023,\npositively affecting\nassets under\nsupervision.\n\nIn the future, if\nmarket and economic\nconditions deteriorate\nfurther, it may lead\nto a decline in asset\nprices, or investors\ntransitioning to asset\nclasses that typically\ngenerate lower fees or\nwithdrawing their\nassets, and net\nrevenues in Asset &\nWealth Management\nwould likely continue\nto be negatively\nimpacted.\n\nThree Months Ended\nJune 2023 ver sus June\n2022. Net revenues in\nAsset & Wealth\nManagement were $3.05\nbillion for the second\nquarter of 2023, 4%\nlower than the second\nquarter of 2022,\nreflecting\nsignificantly higher\nnet losses in Equity\ninvestments,\nsignificantly lower\nIncentive fees and\nsignificantly lower\nnet revenues in Debt\ninvestments, partially\noffset by\nsignificantly higher\nnet revenues in\nPrivate banking and\nlending and slightly\nhigher Management and\nother fees.\n\nThe increase in net\nlosses in Equity\ninvestments primarily\nreflected net losses\nfrom real estate\ninvestments compared\nwith net gains in the\nprior year period,\npartially offset by\nsignificantly lower\nnet losses from\ninvestments in public\nequities. The decrease\nin Incentive fees was\ndriven by significant\nharvesting in the\nprior year period. The\ndecrease in Debt\ninvestments net\nrevenues reflected net\nmark-downs in real\nestate investments.\nThe increase in\nPrivate banking and\nlending net revenues\nprimarily reflected\nthe impact of higher\ndeposit spreads and\nbalances, as well as a\ngain of approximately\n$100 million related\nto the sale of\nsubstantially all of\nthe remaining Marcus\nloans portfolio. The\nincrease in Management\nand other fees\nprimarily reflected\nthe impact of higher\naverage assets under\nsupervision.\n\nProvision for credit\nlosses was $15 million\nfor the second quarter\nof 2023, compared with\n$149 million for the\nsecond quarter of\n2022. Provisions for\nthe second quarter of\n2023 reflected\nindividual impairments\non wholesale loans,\noffset by a reserve\nreduction related to\nsales and paydowns.\nProvisions for the\nsecond quarter of 2022\nreflected growth in\nthe Marcus loans\nportfolio and the\nimpact of broad\nmacroeconomic\nconcerns.\n\nOperating expenses\nwere $3.28 billion for\nthe second quarter of\n2023, 16% higher than\nthe second quarter of\n2022, largely due to\nimpairments of\napproximately $485\nmillion related to\ncommercial real estate\nincluded within\nconsolidated\ninvestment entities .\nPre-tax loss was $243\nmillion for the second\nquarter of 2023,\ncompared with pre-tax\nearnings of $207\nmillion for the second\nquarter of 2022.\n\nSix Months Ended June\n2023 ver sus June\n2022. Net revenues in\nAsset & Wealth\nManagement were $6.26\nbillion for the first\nhalf of 2023, 8%\nhigher than the first\nhalf of 2022,\nprimarily reflecting\nhigher Management and\nother fees and higher\nnet revenues in\nPrivate banking and\nlending, partially\noffset by\nsignificantly lower\nIncentive fees. Net\nrevenues in Private\nbanking and lending\nincluded net revenues\nof approximately\n$(370) million related\nto the sale of\nsubstantially all of\nthe Marcus loans\nportfolio (offset by a\nrelated reserve\nreduction of\napproximately $440\nmillion in provision\nfor credit losses).\n\nThe increase in\nManagement and other\nfees primarily\nreflected the\ninclusion of NNIP and\na reduction in fee\nwaivers on money\nmarket funds. The\nincrease in Private\nbanking and lending\nnet revenues primarily\nreflected the impact\nof higher deposit\nspreads and balances,\npartially offset by\nthe impact of the sale\nof substantially all\nof the Marcus loans\nportfolio. The\ndecrease in net losses\nin Equity investments\nreflected\nsignificantly lower\nnet losses from\ninvestments in public\nequities, partially\noffset by net losses\nfrom real estate\ninvestments compared\nwith net gains in the\nprior year period. The\ndecrease in Incentive\nfees was driven by\nsignificant harvesting\nin the prior year\nperiod.\n\nProvision for credit\nlosses was a net\nbenefit of $550\nmillion for the first\nhalf of 2023, compared\nwith a provision of\n$352 million for the\nfirst half of 2022.\nThe net benefit for\nthe first half of 2023\nreflected reserve\nreductions related to\nthe sale of\nsubstantially all of\nthe Marcus loans\nportfolio, as well as\nother sales and\npaydowns. Provisions\nfor the first half of\n2022 reflected growth\nin the Marcus loans\nportfolio and the\nimpact of\nmacroeconomic and\ngeopolitical concerns.\n\nOperating expenses\nwere $6.44 billion for\nthe first half of\n2023, 23% higher than\nthe first half of\n2022, primarily due to\nimpairments of\napproximately $840\nmillion related to\ncommercial real estate\nincluded within\nconsolidated\ninvestment entities ,\nhigher compensation\nand benefits expenses\nand the inclusion of\nNNIP.

We believe that our\nrelationships with our creditors are critical\nto our liquidity. Our creditors include banks,\ngovernments, securities lenders, corporations,\npension funds, insurance companies, mutual\nfunds and individuals. We have imposed various\ninternal guidelines to monitor creditor\nconcentration across our funding programs.\nDeposits. Our deposits provide us with a\ndiversified source of funding and reduce our\nreliance on wholesale funding. We raise\ndeposits, including savings, demand and time\ndeposits, from private bank clients,\nconsumers, transaction banking clients, other\ninstitutional clients, and through internal\nand third-party broker-dealers. Substantially\nall of our deposits are raised through Goldman\nSachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA), Goldman Sachs\nInternational Bank (GSIB) and Goldman Sachs\nBank Europe SE (GSBE). See Note 13 to the\nconsolidated financial statements for further\ninformation about our deposits, including a\nmaturity profile of our time deposits.\n\nSecured Funding. We fund a significant amount\nof inventory and a portion of investments on a\nsecured basis. Secured funding includes\ncollateralized financings in the consolidated\nbalance sheets. See Note 11 to the\nconsolidated financial statements for further\ninformation about our collateralized\nfinancings, including its maturity profile. We\nmay also pledge our inventory and investments\nas collateral for securities borrowed under a\nsecurities lending agreement. We also use our\nown inventory and investments to cover\ntransactions in which we or our clients have\nsold securities that have not yet been\npurchased. Secured funding is less sensitive\nto changes in our credit quality than\nunsecured funding, due to our posting of\ncollateral to our lenders. Nonetheless, we\nanalyze the refinancing risk of our secured\nfunding activities, taking into account trade\ntenors, maturity profiles, counterparty\nconcentrations, collateral eligibility and\ncounterparty rollover probabilities. We seek\nto mitigate our refinancing risk by executing\nterm trades with staggered maturities,\ndiversifying counterparties, raising excess\nsecured funding and pre-funding residual risk\nthrough our GCLA. We seek to raise secured\nfunding with a term appropriate for the\nliquidity of the assets that are being\nfinanced, and we seek longer maturities for\nsecured funding collateralized by asset\nclasses that may be harder to fund on a\nsecured basis, especially during times of\nmarket stress. Our secured funding, excluding\nfunding collateralized by liquid government\nand agency obligations, is primarily executed\nfor tenors of one month or greater and is\nprimarily executed through term repurchase\nagreements and securities loaned contracts.\nAssets that may be harder to fund on a secured\nbasis during times of market stress include\ncertain financial instruments in the following\ncategories: mortgage- and other asset-backed\nloans and securities, non-investment-grade\ncorporate debt securities, equity securities\nand emerging market securities. We also raise\nfinancing through other types of\ncollateralized financings, such as secured\nloans and notes. GS Bank USA has access to\nfunding from the Federal Home Loan Bank. We\nhad no outstanding borrowings from the Federal\nHome Loan Bank as of both June 2023 and\nDecember 2022. Additionally, we have access to\nfunding through the Federal Reserve discount\nwindow. However, we do not rely on this\nfunding in our liquidity planning and stress\ntesting.\n                                            \n  131    Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We have in place a comprehensive capital\nmanagement policy that provides a framework,\ndefines objectives and establishes guidelines\nto assist us in maintaining the appropriate\nlevel and composition of capital in both\nbusiness-as-usual and stressed conditions.\nCapital Management We determine the\nappropriate amount and composition of our\ncapital by considering multiple factors,\nincluding our current and future regulatory\ncapital requirements, the results of our\ncapital planning and stress testing process,\nthe results of resolution capital models and\nother factors, such as rating agency\nguidelines, subsidiary capital requirements,\nthe business environment and conditions in the\nfinancial markets. We manage our capital\nrequirements and the levels of our capital\nusage principally by setting limits on the\nbalance sheet and/or limits on risk, in each\ncase at both the firmwide and business levels.\nWe principally manage the level and\ncomposition of our capital through issuances\nand repurchases of our common stock. We may\nissue, redeem or repurchase our preferred\nstock and subordinated debt or other forms of\ncapital as business conditions warrant. Prior\nto such redemptions or repurchases, we must\nreceive approval from the FRB. See Notes 14\nand 19 to the consolidated financial\nstatements for further information about our\npreferred stock and subordinated debt. Capital\nPlanning and Stress Testing Process. As part\nof capital planning, we project sources and\nuses of capital given a range of business\nenvironments, including stressed conditions.\nOur stress testing process is designed to\nidentify and measure material risks associated\nwith our business activities, including market\nrisk, credit risk, operational risk and\nliquidity risk, as well as our ability to\ngenerate revenues. Our capital planning\nprocess incorporates an internal capital\nadequacy assessment with the objective of\nensuring that we are appropriately capitalized\nrelative to the risks in our businesses. We\nincorporate stress scenarios into our capital\nplanning process with a goal of holding\nsufficient capital to ensure we remain\nadequately capitalized after experiencing a\nsevere stress event. Our assessment of capital\nadequacy is viewed in tandem with our\nassessment of liquidity adequacy and is\nintegrated into our overall risk management\nstructure, governance and policy framework.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q    132  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We provide\nfurther information\nabout our stress test\nprocesses and a\nsummary of the results\non our website as\ndescribed in\n\u201cAvailable\nInformation.\u201d\n\nAs required by the\nFRB\u2019s CCAR rules, we\nsubmit an annual\ncapital plan for\nreview by the FRB. The\npurpose of the FRB\u2019s\nreview is to ensure\nthat we have a robust,\nforward-looking\ncapital planning\nprocess that accounts\nfor our unique risks\nand that permits\ncontinued operation\nduring times of\neconomic and financial\nstress.\n\nThe FRB evaluates us\nbased, in part, on\nwhether we have the\ncapital necessary to\ncontinue operating\nunder the baseline and\nseverely adverse\nscenarios provided by\nthe FRB and those\ndeveloped internally.\nThis evaluation also\ntakes into account our\nprocess for\nidentifying risk, our\ncontrols and\ngovernance for capital\nplanning, and our\nguidelines for making\ncapital planning\ndecisions. In\naddition, the FRB\nevaluates our plan to\nmake capital\ndistributions (i.e.,\ndividend payments and\nrepurchases or\nredemptions of stock,\nsubordinated debt or\nother capital\nsecurities) and issue\ncapital, across the\nrange of macroeconomic\nscenarios and firm-\nspecific assumptions.\nThe FRB determines the\nstress capital buffer\n(SCB) applicable to us\nbased on its own\nannual stress test.\nThe SCB under the\nStandardized approach\nis calculated as (i)\nthe difference between\nour starting and\nminimum projected CET1\ncapital ratios under\nthe supe rvisory\nseverely adverse\nscenario and (ii) our\nplanned common stock\ndividends for each of\nthe fourth through\nseventh quarters of\nthe planning horizon,\nexpressed as a\npercentage of risk-\nweighted assets\n(RWAs).\n\nBased on our 2023 CCAR\nsubmission, the FRB\nreduced our SCB from\n6.3% to 5.5% for the\nperiod from October 1,\n2023 through September\n30, 2024. As a result,\nbeginning on October\n1, 2023, our\nStandardized CET1\ncapital ratio\nrequirement will be\n13.0%.

As part of our\ncomprehensive capital\nmanagement policy, we\nmaintain a contingency\ncapital plan. Our\ncontingency capital\nplan provides a\nframework for\nanalyzing and\nresponding to a\nperceived or actual\ncapital deficiency,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to,\nidentification of\ndrivers of a capital\ndeficiency, as well as\nmitigants and\npotential actions. It\noutlines the\nappropriate\ncommunication\nprocedures to follow\nduring a crisis\nperiod, including\ninternal dissemination\nof information, as\nwell as timely\ncommunication with\nexternal stakeholders.\n\nCapital Attribution.\nWe assess the capital\nusage of each of our\nbusinesses based on\nour attributed equity\nframework. This\nframework considers\nmany factors,\nincluding our internal\nassessment of risks as\nwell as the regulatory\ncapital requirements\nrelated to our\nbusiness activities.\nThese regulatory\ncapital requirements\ntake into\nconsideration our most\nbinding capital\nconstraints. Our most\nbinding capital\nconstraint is our CET1\ncapital ratio\nrequirement under the\nStandardized Capital\nRules. This\nrequirement includes\nthe SCB which is\ndetermined by the FRB\nbased on its own\nannual stress test.\n\nShare Repurchase\nProgram. We use our\nshare repurchase\nprogram to help\nmaintain the\nappropriate level of\ncommon equity. The\nrepurchase program is\neffected primarily\nthrough regular open-\nmarket purchases\n(which may include\nrepurchase plans\ndesigned to comply\nwith Rule 10b5-1 and\naccelerated share\nrepurchases), the\namounts and timing of\nwhich are determined\nprimarily by our\ncurrent and projected\ncapital position and\nour capital plan\nsubmitted to the FRB\nas part of CCAR. The\namounts and timing of\nthe repurchases may\nalso be influenced by\ngeneral market\nconditions and the\nprevailing price and\ntrading volumes of our\ncommon stock.\n\nDuring the second\nquarter of 2023, we\nreturned a total of\n$1.61 billion to\nshareholders,\nincluding common stock\nrepurchases of $750\nmillion and common\nstock dividends of\n$864 million. The\nBoard of Directors of\nGroup Inc. (Board)\napproved an increase\nin our common stock\ndividend from $2.50 to\n$2.75 per share\nbeginning in the third\nquarter of 2023. Based\non the increase in our\ncommon stock dividend\nand consistent with\nour capital management\nphilosophy, we will\ncontinue prioritizing\ndeployment of capital\nfor our clients where\nreturns are attractive\nand return any excess\ncapital to\nshareholders through\ndividends and share\nrepurchases. We intend\nto increase our stock\nrepurchase levels in\nthe third quarter of\n2023 relative to the\nsecond quarter of\n2023.\n                                            \n  133    Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The Inflation\nReduction Act of 2022\nenacted a one percent\nnon-deductible excise\ntax (buyback tax) on\nthe fair market value\nof certain corporate\nshare repurchases\nafter December 31,\n2022. The fair market\nvalue of share\nrepurchases subject to\nthe tax is reduced by\nthe fair market value\nof any stock issued\nduring the calendar\nyear, including stock\nissued to employees.\nThe buyback tax did\nnot have a material\nimpact on our\nfinancial condition,\nresults of operations\nor cash flows for\neither the three or\nsix months ended June\n2023. Resolution\nCapital Models. In\nconnection with our\nresolution planning\nefforts, we have\nestablished a\nResolution Capital\nAdequacy and\nPositioning framework,\nwhich is designed to\nensure that our major\nsubsidiaries (GS Bank\nUSA, Goldman Sachs &\nCo. LLC (GS&Co.), GSI,\nGSIB, GSBE, Goldman\nSachs Japan Co., Ltd.\n(GSJCL), Goldman Sachs\nAsset Management, L.P.\nand Goldman Sachs\nAsset Management\nInternational) have\naccess to sufficient\nloss-absorbing\ncapacity (in the form\nof equity,\nsubordinated debt and\nunsecured senior debt)\nso that they are able\nto wind down following\na Group Inc.\nbankruptcy filing in\naccordance with our\npreferred resolution\nstrategy. In addition,\nwe have established a\ntriggers and alerts\nframework, which is\ndesigned to provide\nthe Board with\ninformation needed to\nmake an informed\ndecision on whether\nand when to commence\nbankruptcy proceedings\nfor Group Inc. We\nsubmitted our 2023\nresolution plan in\nJune 2023. See\n\"Available\nInformation\" for\ninformation about the\npublic portion of our\nresolution plan\nsubmission. Rating\nAgency Guidelines The\ncredit rating agencies\nassign credit ratings\nto the obligations of\nGroup Inc., which\ndirectly issues or\nguarantees\nsubstantially all of\nour senior unsecured\ndebt obligations.\nGS&Co. and GSI have\nbeen assigned long-\nand short-term issuer\nratings by certain\ncredit rating\nagencies. GS Bank USA,\nGSIB and GSBE have\nalso been assigned\nlong- and short-term\nissuer ratings, as\nwell as ratings on\ntheir long- and short-\nterm bank deposits. In\naddition, credit\nrating agencies have\nassigned ratings to\ndebt obligations of\ncertain other\nsubsidiaries of Group\nInc.\n\nThe level and\ncomposition of our\ncapital are among the\nmany factors\nconsidered in\ndetermining our credit\nratings.

Our\nG-SIB surcharge is\n3.0% for 2023 and\n2024. The G-SIB\nsurcharge and\ncountercyclical\ncapital buffer in the\nfuture may differ due\nto additional guidance\nfrom our regulators\nand/or positional\nchanges, and our SCB\nis likely to change\nfrom year to year\nbased on the results\nof the annual\nsupervisory stress\ntests. Our target is\nto maintain capital\nratios equal to the\nregulatory\nrequirements plus a\nbuffer of 50 to 100\nbasis points.

GS&Co. has\nelected to calculate its minimum capital\nrequirements in accordance with the\n\u201cAlternative Net Capital Requirement\u201d as\npermitted by Rule 15c3-1 of the SEC. GS&Co.\nhad regulatory net capital, as defined by Rule\n15c3-1, of $23.15 billion as of June 2023 and\n$22.21 billion as of December 2022, which\nexceeded the amount required by $18.17 billion\nas of June 2023 and $17.46 billion as of\nDecember 2022. In addition to its alternative\nminimum net capital requirements, GS&Co. is\nalso required to hold tentative net capital in\nexcess of $5 billion and net capital in excess\nof $1 billion in accordance with Rule 15c3-1.\nGS&Co. is also required to notify the SEC in\nthe event that its tentative net capital is\nless than $6 billion. As of both June 2023 and\nDecember 2022, GS&Co. had tentative net\ncapital and net capital in excess of both the\nminimum and the notification requirements.\n                                            \n  135    Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Regulations have been adopted or\nare being considered by regulators and policy\nmakers worldwide. Given that many of the new\nand proposed rules are highly complex, the\nfull impact of regulatory reform will not be\nknown until the rules are implemented and\nmarket practices develop under the final\nregulations. See \u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation\u201d in\nPart I, Item 1 of the 2022 Form 10 -K for\nfurther information about the laws, rules and\nregulations and proposed laws, rules and\nregulations that apply to us and our\noperations. Basel III Reforms. In July 2023,\nthe U.S. federal bank regulatory authorities\nproposed a rule implementing the Basel\nCommittee\u2019s finalization of the post-crisis\nregulatory capital reforms. The proposal\nprovides for a July 1, 2025 effective date,\nsubject to a three-year transition period. The\nproposal includes the Fundamental Review of\nthe Trading Book, which replaces the market\nrisk rule, and introduces new standardized\napproaches for credit risk, operational risk\nand credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk,\nwhich would replace the current models-based\napproaches. The Federal Reserve also proposed\na rule to revise the G-SIB surcharge. The\nproposals are currently open for comment. We\nare currently evaluating the impact of the\nproposed rules, but expect that these rules,\nif adopted as proposed, could materially\nincrease our regulatory capital requirements.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q    136  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

As of\nJuly 1, 2023, the\npublication of all\nLIBOR settings as\nrepresentative rates\nhas ceased. The FCA\nhas allowed the\npublication and use of\nsynthetic rates for\ncertain GBP LIBOR\nsettings in legacy GBP\nLIBOR-based contracts\nthrough March 2024 and\nfor certain USD LIBOR\nsettings in legacy USD\nLIBOR-based contracts\nthrough September\n2024.\n\nThe International\nSwaps and Derivatives\nAssociation (ISDA)\n2020 IBOR Fallbacks\nProtocol (IBOR\nProtocol) has provided\nderivatives market\nparticipants with\namended fallbacks for\nlegacy and new\nderivative contracts\nto mitigate legal or\neconomic uncertainty.\nBoth counterparties\nhad to adhere to the\nIBOR Protocol or\nengage in bilateral\namendments for the\nterms to be effective\nfor derivative\ncontracts. The FCA's\nformal announcement to\ncease all LIBOR\nsettings fixed the\nspread adjustment for\nall LIBOR rates and,\nas of July 1, 2023,\nthe fallbacks have\nbeen applied for all\nLIBOR settings. Rules\nadopted by the FRB\nunder the Adjustable\nInterest Rate (LIBOR)\nAct provide different\nSecured Overnight\nFinancing Rate\n(SOFR)-based rates for\ncontracts governed by\nU.S. law that have no\nfallbacks or fallbacks\nthat would require the\nuse of a poll or\nLIBOR-based rate.\n\nWe had facilitated an\norderly transition\nfrom non-USD LIBORs to\nalternative risk-free\nreference rates and\nsynthetic rates for us\nand our clients in\nconnection with the\ncessation of non-USD\nLIBOR.\n\nIn connection with the\ncessation of USD\nLIBOR, all of our USD\nLIBOR-based derivative\ncontracts have been\ntransitioned to\nalternative risk-free\nreference rates. We\nhave replaced our USD\nLIBOR-based unsecured\nbenchmark debt and\npreferred stock with\nterm SOFR plus the\nprescribed tenor\nspread in accordance\nwith the FRB\u2019s final\nrule under the LIBOR\nAct. In addition, our\nlegacy USD LIBOR-based\nloans have been\ntransitioned to\nalternative risk-free\nreference rates in\naccordance with\nfallback provisions.\n\nStress in the Banking\nSector. During the\nsecond quarter of\n2023, the level of\nstress in the banking\nsector eased compared\nto the circumstances\nthat arose in March\n2023, which had led to\nthe failure of certain\nregional banks in the\nU.S. and the\ncombination of\nSwitzerland\u2019s two\nlargest banks. As a\nmember of a consortium\nof banks that provided\nliquidity support to\nFirst Republic, we\nmade a deposit of $2.5\nbillion with First\nRepublic in March\n2023. Following the\nFDIC\u2019s seizure and\nsale of First Republic\nin May 2023, this\ndeposit was fully\nrepaid to us.\n\nIn May 2023, the FDIC\nreleased a proposed\nrule that would impose\nspecial assessments to\nrecover the losses to\nthe deposit insurance\nfund resulting from\nthe receiverships of\nSilicon Valley Bank\nand Signature Bank.\nThe FDIC stated that\nit currently estimates\nthose assessed losses\nto total $15.8 billion\nand that the amount of\nthe special\nassessments would be\nadjusted as the loss\nestimate changes.\nUnder the proposed\nrule, the assessment\nbase would be an\ninsured depository\ninstitution\u2019s\nestimated uninsured\ndeposits as of\nDecember 2022,\nexcluding the first $5\nbillion of uninsured\ndeposits. The special\nassessments would be\ncollected at an annual\nrate of approximately\n12.5 basis points per\nyear over eight\nquarters beginning in\n2024 and through 2025.\nIf the rule is adopted\nas currently proposed,\nthe estimated cost of\nthis special\nassessment for us\nwould be approximately\n$400 million (pre-tax)\nand such expense would\nbe recognized entirely\nin the quarter in\nwhich the rule is\nadopted.\n\nThe events in the\nfirst quarter of 2023\nplaced heightened\nfocus on the impact\nthat rising interest\nrates have had on the\nmarket values of\navailable-for-sale and\nheld-to-maturity\nsecurities portfolios\nof banks. As of June\n2023, the carrying\nvalue of our\navailable-for-sale\nsecurities portfolio\nwas $50.11 billion,\nsubstantially all of\nwhich consisted of\nU.S. government\nobligations. As of\nJune 2023, the pre-tax\nnet unrealized losses\nincluded in\naccumulated other\ncomprehensive\nincome/(loss) and our\nregulatory capital\nratios relating to\nthese securities were\n$3.00 billion. As of\nJune 2023, the\ncarrying value of our\nheld-to-maturity\nsecurities portfolio\nwas $59.08 billion,\nsubstantially all of\nwhich was comprised of\nU.S. government\nobligations. The pre-\ntax net unrealized\nlosses on these\nsecurities were $1.70\nbillion. If the\nunrealized losses on\nheld-to-maturity\nsecurities had been\nrecognized as a\nreduction to our\nregulatory capital,\nthe after-tax impact\nwould have been a\nreduction of\napproximately 0.2\npercentage point to\nour regulatory capital\nratios as of June\n2023. See Note 8 for\nfurther information\nabout available-for-\nsale and held-to-\nmaturity securities.\n\nOur liquidity position\nduring the second\nquarter of 2023\nremained strong, as\nour GCLA averaged\n$409.65 billion for\nthe quarter. Our\ndeposits were $398.85\nbillion, compared with\n$375.53 billion as of\nMarch 2023. As of June\n2023, approximately\n$211.21 billion of\ndeposits were insured\nby the FDIC and $25.89\nbillion were insured\nby non-U.S. insurance\nprograms.

Overview and Structure of\nRisk Management Overview We believe that\neffective risk management is critical to our\nsuccess. Accordingly, we have established an\nenterprise risk management framework that\nemploys a comprehensive, integrated approach\nto risk management, and is designed to enable\ncomprehensive risk management processes\nthrough which we identify, assess, monitor and\nmanage the risks we assume in conducting our\nactivities. Our risk management structure is\nbuilt around three core components:\ngovernance, processes and people. Governance.\nRisk management governance starts with the\nBoard, which both directly and through its\ncommittees, including its Risk Committee,\noversees our risk management policies and\npractices implemented through the enterprise\nrisk management framework. The Board is also\nresponsible for the annual review and approval\nof our risk appetite statement. The risk\nappetite statement describes the levels and\ntypes of risk we are willing to accept or to\navoid, in order to achieve our objectives\nincluded in our strategic business plan, while\nremaining in compliance with regulatory\nrequirements. The Board reviews our strategic\nbusiness plan and is ultimately responsible\nfor overseeing and providing direction about\nour strategy and risk appetite. The Board\nreceives regular briefings on firmwide risks,\nincluding liquidity risk, market risk, credit\nrisk, operational risk, model risk and climate\nrisk, from our independent risk oversight and\ncontrol functions, including the chief risk\nofficer, and on compliance risk and conduct\nrisk from the chief compliance officer, on\nlegal and regulatory enforcement matters from\nthe chief legal officer, and on other matters\nimpacting our reputation from the chair and\nvice-chairs of our Firmwide Reputational Risk\nCommittee. The chief risk officer reports to\nour chief executive officer and to the Risk\nCommittee of the Board. As part of the review\nof the firmwide risk portfolio, the chief risk\nofficer regularly advises the Risk Committee\nof the Board of relevant risk metrics and\nmaterial exposures, including risk limits and\nthresholds established in our risk appetite\nstatement.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q    138  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \nThe implementation of\nour risk governance\nstructure and core\nrisk management\nprocesses is overseen\nby Enterprise Risk,\nwhich reports to our\nchief risk officer,\nand is responsible for\nensuring that our\nenterprise risk\nmanagement framework\nprovides the Board,\nour risk committees\nand senior management\nwith a consistent and\nintegrated approach to\nmanaging our various\nrisks in a manner\nconsistent with our\nrisk appetite.\n\nOur revenue-producing\nunits, as well as\nTreasury, Engineering,\nHuman Capital\nManagement,\nOperations, and\nCorporate and\nWorkplace Solutions,\nare considered our\nfirst line of defense.\nThey are accountable\nfor the outcomes of\nour risk-generating\nactivities, as well as\nfor assessing and\nmanaging those risks\nwithin our risk\nappetite.\n\nOur independent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions are\nconsidered our second\nline of defense and\nprovide independent\nassessment, oversight\nand challenge of the\nrisks taken by our\nfirst line of defense,\nas well as lead and\nparticipate in risk\ncommittees.\nIndependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions include\nCompliance, Conflicts\nResolution,\nControllers, Legal,\nRisk and Tax.\n\nInternal Audit is\nconsidered our third\nline of defense, and\nour director of\nInternal Audit reports\nto the Audit Committee\nof the Board and\nadministratively to\nour chief executive\nofficer. Internal\nAudit includes\nprofessionals with a\nbroad range of audit\nand industry\nexperience, including\nrisk management\nexpertise. Internal\nAudit is responsible\nfor independently\nassessing and\nvalidating the\neffectiveness of key\ncontrols, including\nthose within the risk\nmanagement framework,\nand providing timely\nreporting to the Audit\nCommittee of the\nBoard, senior\nmanagement and\nregulators.\n\nThe three lines of\ndefense structure\npromotes the\naccountability of\nfirst line risk\ntakers, provides a\nframework for\neffective challenge by\nthe second line and\nempowers independent\nreview from the third\nline.\n\nProcesses. We maintain\nvarious processes that\nare critical\ncomponents of our risk\nmanagement framework,\nincluding (i) risk\nidentification and\ncontrol assessment,\n(ii) risk appetite,\nlimit and threshold\nsetting, (iii) risk\nmetrics, reporting and\nmonitoring, and (iv)\nrisk decision-making.\n\n\u2022 Risk Identification\nand Control\nAssessment. We believe\nthe identification of\nour risks and related\ncontrol assessment is\na critical step in\nproviding our Board\nand senior management\ntransparency and\ninsight into the range\nand materiality of our\nrisks. We have a\ncomprehensive data\ncollection process,\nincluding firmwide\npolicies and\nprocedures that\nrequire all employees\nto report and escalate\nrisk events. Our\napproach for risk\nidentification and\ncontrol assessment is\ncomprehensive across\nall risk types, is\ndynamic and forward-\nlooking to reflect and\nadapt to our changing\nrisk profile and\nbusiness environment,\nleverages subject\nmatter expertise, and\nallows for\nprioritization of our\nmost critical risks.\nThis approach also\nencompasses our\ncontrol assessment,\nled by our second line\nof defense, to review\nand challenge the\ncontrol environment to\nensure it supports our\nstrategic business\nplan.\n\nTo effectively assess\nour risks, we maintain\na daily discipline of\nmarking substantially\nall of our inventory\nto current market\nlevels. We carry our\ninventory at fair\nvalue, with changes in\nvaluation reflected\nimmediately in our\nrisk management\nsystems and in net\nrevenues. We do so\nbecause we believe\nthis discipline is one\nof the most effective\ntools for assessing\nand managing risk and\nthat it provides\ntransparent and\nrealistic insight into\nour inventory\nexposures.\n\nAn important part of\nour risk management\nprocess is firmwide\nstress testing. It\nallows us to quantify\nour exposure to tail\nrisks, highlight\npotential loss\nconcentrations,\nundertake risk/reward\nanalysis, and assess\nand mitigate our risk\npositions. Firmwide\nstress tests are\nperformed on a regular\nbasis and are designed\nto ensure a\ncomprehensive analysis\nof our vulnerabilities\nand idiosyncratic\nrisks combining\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial risks,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, credit,\nmarket, liquidity and\nfunding, operational\nand compliance,\nstrategic, systemic\nand emerging risks\ninto a single combined\nscenario. We also\nperform ad hoc stress\ntests in anticipation\nof market events or\nconditions. Stress\ntests are also used to\nassess capital\nadequacy as part of\nour capital planning\nand stress testing\nprocess. See \u201cCapital\nManagement and\nRegulatory Capital \u2014\nCapital Management\u201d\nfor further\ninformation.\n\n\u2022 Risk Appetite, Limit\nand Threshold Setting.\nWe apply a rigorous\nframework of limits\nand thresholds to\ncontrol and monitor\nrisk across\ntransactions,\nproducts, businesses\nand markets. The\nBoard, directly or\nindirectly through its\nRisk Committee,\napproves limits and\nthresholds included in\nour risk appetite\nstatement at firmwide,\nbusiness and product\nlevels. In addition,\nthe Firmwide Risk\nAppetite Committee,\nthrough delegated\nauthority from the\nFirmwide Enterprise\nRisk Committee, is\nresponsible for\napproving our risk\nlimits and thresholds\npolicy, subject to the\noverall limits\napproved by the Risk\nCommittee of the\nBoard, and monitoring\nthese limits.\n\nThe Firmwide Risk\nAppetite Committee is\nresponsible for\napproving limits at\nfirmwide, business and\nproduct levels.\nCertain limits may be\nset at levels that\nwill require periodic\nadjustment, rather\nthan at levels that\nreflect our maximum\nrisk appetite. This\nfosters an ongoing\ndialogue about risk\namong our first and\nsecond lines of\ndefense, committees\nand senior management,\nas well as rapid\nescalation of risk-\nrelated matters.\nAdditionally, through\ndelegated authority\nfrom the Firmwide Risk\nAppetite Committee,\nMarket Risk sets\nlimits at certain\nproduct and desk\nlevels, and Credit\nRisk sets limits for\nindividual\ncounterparties and\ntheir subsidiaries,\nindustries and\ncountries. Limits are\nreviewed regularly and\namended on a permanent\nor temporary basis to\nreflect changes to our\nstrategic business\nplan, as well as\nchanging market\nconditions, business\nconditions or risk\ntolerance.\n                                            \n  139    Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \n\u2022 Risk Metrics,\nReporting and\nMonitoring. Effective\nrisk reporting and\nrisk decision-making\ndepends on our ability\nto get the right\ninformation to the\nright people at the\nright time. As such,\nwe focus on the rigor\nand effectiveness of\nour risk systems, with\nthe objective of\nensuring that our risk\nmanagement technology\nsystems provide us\nwith complete,\naccurate and timely\ninformation. Our risk\nmetrics, reporting and\nmonitoring processes\nare designed to take\ninto account\ninformation about both\nexisting and emerging\nrisks, thereby\nenabling our risk\ncommittees and senior\nmanagement to perform\ntheir responsibilities\nwith the appropriate\nlevel of insight into\nrisk exposures.\nFurthermore, our limit\nand threshold breach\nprocesses provide\nmeans for timely\nescalation. We\nevaluate changes in\nour risk profile and\nour businesses,\nincluding changes in\nbusiness mix or\njurisdictions in which\nwe operate, by\nmonitoring risk\nfactors at a firmwide\nlevel.\n\n\u2022 Risk Decision-\nMaking. Our governance\nstructure provides the\nprotocol and\nresponsibility for\ndecision-making on\nrisk management issues\nand ensures\nimplementation of\nthose decisions. We\nmake extensive use of\nrisk committees that\nmeet regularly and\nserve as an important\nmeans to facilitate\nand foster ongoing\ndiscussions to manage\nand mitigate risks.\n\nWe maintain strong and\nproactive\ncommunication about\nrisk and we have a\nculture of\ncollaboration in\ndecision-making among\nour first and second\nlines of defense,\ncommittees and senior\nmanagement. While our\nfirst line of defense\nis responsible for\nmanagement of their\nrisk, we dedicate\nextensive resources to\nour second line of\ndefense in order to\nensure a strong\noversight structure\nand an appropriate\nsegregation of duties.\nWe regularly reinforce\nour strong culture of\nescalation and\naccountability across\nall functions.\n\nPeople. Even the best\ntechnology serves only\nas a tool for helping\nto make informed\ndecisions in real time\nabout the risks we are\ntaking. Ultimately,\neffective risk\nmanagement requires\nour people to\ninterpret our risk\ndata on an ongoing and\ntimely basis and\nadjust risk positions\naccordingly. The\nexperience of our\nprofessionals, and\ntheir understanding of\nthe nuances and\nlimitations of each\nrisk measure, guides\nus in assessing\nexposures and\nmaintaining them\nwithin prudent levels.\n\nWe reinforce a culture\nof effective risk\nmanagement, consistent\nwith our risk\nappetite, in our\ntraining and\ndevelopment programs,\nas well as in the way\nwe evaluate\nperformance, and\nrecognize and reward\nour people. Our\ntraining and\ndevelopment programs,\nincluding certain\nsessions led by our\nmost senior leaders,\nare focused on the\nimportance of risk\nmanagement, client\nrelationships and\nreputational\nexcellence. As part of\nour performance review\nprocess, we assess\nreputational\nexcellence, including\nhow an employee\nexercises good risk\nmanagement and\nreputational judgment,\nand adheres to our\ncode of conduct and\ncompliance policies.\nOur review and reward\nprocesses are designed\nto communicate and\nreinforce to our\nprofessionals the link\nbetween behavior and\nhow people are\nrecognized, the need\nto focus on our\nclients and our\nreputation, and the\nneed to always act in\naccordance with our\nhighest standards.\n                                              \n  Structure                                   \n                                              \nUltimate oversight of\nrisk is the\nresponsibility of our\nBoard. The Board\noversees risk both\ndirectly and through\nits committees,\nincluding its Risk\nCommittee. We also\nhave a series of\ncommittees with\nspecific risk\nmanagement mandates\nthat have oversight or\ndecision-making\nresponsibilities for\nrisk management\nactivities. Committee\nmembership generally\nconsists of senior\nmanagers from both our\nfirst and second lines\nof defense. We have\nestablished procedures\nfor these committees\nto ensure that\nappropriate\ninformation barriers\nare in place. Our\nprimary risk\ncommittees, most of\nwhich also have\nadditional sub-\ncommittees, councils\nor working groups, are\ndescribed below. In\naddition to these\ncommittees, we have\nother risk committees\nthat provide oversight\nfor different\nbusinesses,\nactivities, products,\nregions and entities.\nAll of our committees\nhave responsibility\nfor considering the\nimpact on our\nreputation of the\ntransactions and\nactivities that they\noversee.\n\nMembership of our risk\ncommittees is reviewed\nregularly and updated\nto reflect changes in\nthe responsibilities\nof the committee\nmembers. Accordingly,\nthe length of time\nthat members serve on\nthe respective\ncommittees varies as\ndetermined by the\ncommittee chairs and\nbased on the\nresponsibilities of\nthe members.\n\nThe chart below\npresents an overview\nof our risk management\ngovernance structure.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q    140  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

GCLA is\nliquidity that we\nmaintain to meet a\nbroad range of\npotential cash\noutflows and\ncollateral needs in a\nstressed environment.\nA primary liquidity\nprinciple is to pre-\nfund our estimated\npotential cash and\ncollateral needs\nduring a liquidity\ncrisis and hold this\nliquidity in the form\nof unencumbered,\nhighly liquid\nsecurities and cash.\nWe believe that the\nsecurities held in our\nGCLA would be readily\nconvertible to cash in\na matter of days,\nthrough liquidation,\nby entering into\nrepurchase agreements\nor from maturities of\nresale agreements, and\nthat this cash would\nallow us to meet\nimmediate obligations\nwithout needing to\nsell other assets or\ndepend on additional\nfunding from credit-\nsensitive markets.\n\nOur GCLA reflects the\nfollowing principles:\n\n\u2022 The first days or\nweeks of a liquidity\ncrisis are the most\ncritical to a\ncompany\u2019s survival;\n\n\u2022 Focus must be\nmaintained on all\npotential cash and\ncollateral outflows,\nnot just disruptions\nto financing flows.\nOur businesses are\ndiverse, and our\nliquidity needs are\ndetermined by many\nfactors, including\nmarket movements,\ncollateral\nrequirements and\nclient commitments,\nall of which can\nchange dramatically in\na difficult funding\nenvironment;\n\n\u2022 During a liquidity\ncrisis, credit-\nsensitive funding,\nincluding unsecured\ndebt, certain deposits\nand some types of\nsecured financing\nagreements, may be\nunavailable, and the\nterms (e.g., interest\nrates, collateral\nprovisions and tenor)\nor availability of\nother types of secured\nfinancing may change\nand certain deposits\nmay be withdrawn; and\n\n\u2022 As a result of our\npolicy to pre-fund\nliquidity that we\nestimate may be needed\nin a crisis, we hold\nmore unencumbered\nsecurities and have\nlarger funding\nbalances than our\nbusinesses would\notherwise require. We\nbelieve that our\nliquidity is stronger\nwith greater balances\nof highly liquid\nunencumbered\nsecurities, even\nthough it increases\nour total assets and\nour funding costs.\n\nWe maintain our GCLA\nacross Group Inc.,\nGoldman Sachs Funding\nLLC (Funding IHC) and\nGroup Inc.\u2019s major\nbroker-dealer and bank\nsubsidiaries, asset\ntypes and clearing\nagents to provide us\nwith sufficient\noperating liquidity to\nensure timely\nsettlement in all\nmajor markets, even in\na difficult funding\nenvironment. In\naddition to the GCLA,\nwe maintain cash\nbalances and\nsecurities in several\nof our other entities,\nprimarily for use in\nspecific currencies,\nentities or\njurisdictions where we\ndo not have immediate\naccess to parent\ncompany liquidity.\n\nAsset-Liability\nManagement. Our\nliquidity risk\nmanagement policies\nare designed to ensure\nwe have a sufficient\namount of financing,\neven when funding\nmarkets experience\npersistent stress. We\nmanage the maturities\nand diversity of our\nfunding across\nmarkets, products and\ncounterparties, and\nseek to maintain a\ndiversified funding\nprofile with an\nappropriate tenor,\ntaking into\nconsideration the\ncharacteristics and\nliquidity profile of\nour assets.\n\nOur approach to asset-\nliability management\nincludes:\n\n\u2022 Conservatively\nmanaging the overall\ncharacteristics of our\nfunding book, with a\nfocus on maintaining\nlong-term, diversified\nsources of funding in\nexcess of our current\nrequirements. See\n\u201cBalance Sheet and\nFunding Sources \u2014\nFunding Sources\u201d for\nfurther information;\n\n\u2022 Actively managing\nand monitoring our\nasset base, with\nparticular focus on\nthe liquidity, holding\nperiod and ability to\nfund assets on a\nsecured basis. We\nassess our funding\nrequirements and our\nability to liquidate\nassets in a stressed\nenvironment while\nappropriately managing\nrisk. This enables us\nto determine the most\nappropriate funding\nproducts and tenors.\nSee \u201cBalance Sheet and\nFunding Sources \u2014\nBalance Sheet\nManagement\u201d for\nfurther information\nabout our balance\nsheet management\nprocess and \u201c\u2014 Funding\nSources \u2014 Secured\nFunding\u201d for further\ninformation about\nasset classes that may\nbe harder to fund on a\nsecured basis; and\n\n\u2022 Raising secured and\nunsecured financing\nthat has a long tenor\nrelative to the\nliquidity profile of\nour assets. This\nreduces the risk that\nour liabilities will\ncome due in advance of\nour ability to\ngenerate liquidity\nfrom the sale of our\nassets. Because we\nmaintain a highly\nliquid balance sheet,\nthe holding period of\ncertain of our assets\nmay be materially\nshorter than their\ncontractual maturity\ndates.\n\nOur goal is to ensure\nthat we maintain\nsufficient liquidity\nto fund our assets and\nmeet our contractual\nand contingent\nobligations in normal\ntimes, as well as\nduring periods of\nmarket stress. Through\nour dynamic balance\nsheet management\nprocess, we use actual\nand projected asset\nbalances to determine\nsecured and unsecured\nfunding requirements.\nFunding plans are\nreviewed and approved\nby the Firmwide Asset\nLiability Committee.\nIn addition, our\nindependent risk\noversight and control\nfunctions analyze, and\nthe Firmwide Asset\nLiability Committee\nreviews, our\nconsolidated total\ncapital position\n(unsecured long-term\nborrowings plus total\nshareholders\u2019 equity)\nso that we maintain a\nlevel of long-term\nfunding that is\nsufficient to meet our\nlong-term financing\nrequirements. In a\nliquidity crisis, we\nwould first use our\nGCLA in order to avoid\nreliance on asset\nsales (other than our\nGCLA). However, we\nrecognize that orderly\nasset sales may be\nprudent or necessary\nin a severe or\npersistent liquidity\ncrisis.\n                                            \n  143    Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \nSubsidiary Funding\nPolicies\nThe majority of our\nunsecured borrowings\nis raised by Group\nInc., which provides\nthe necessary funds to\nFunding IHC and other\nsubsidiaries, some of\nwhich are regulated,\nto meet their asset\nfinancing, liquidity\nand capital\nrequirements. In\naddition, Group Inc.\nprovides its regulated\nsubsidiaries with the\nnecessary capital to\nmeet their regulatory\nrequirements. The\nbenefits of this\napproach to subsidiary\nfunding are enhanced\ncontrol and greater\nflexibility to meet\nthe funding\nrequirements of our\nsubsidiaries. Funding\nis also raised at the\nsubsidiary level\nthrough a variety of\nproducts, including\ndeposits, secured\nfunding and unsecured\nborrowings.\n\nOur intercompany\nfunding policies\nassume that a\nsubsidiary\u2019s funds or\nsecurities are not\nfreely available to\nits parent, Funding\nIHC or other\nsubsidiaries unless\n(i) legally provided\nfor and (ii) there are\nno additional\nregulatory, tax or\nother restrictions. In\nparticular, many of\nour subsidiaries are\nsubject to laws that\nauthorize regulatory\nbodies to block or\nreduce the flow of\nfunds from those\nsubsidiaries to Group\nInc. or Funding IHC.\nRegulatory action of\nthat kind could impede\naccess to funds that\nGroup Inc. needs to\nmake payments on its\nobligations.\nAccordingly, we assume\nthat the capital\nprovided to our\nregulated subsidiaries\nis not available to\nGroup Inc. or other\nsubsidiaries and any\nother financing\nprovided to our\nregulated subsidiaries\nis not available to\nGroup Inc. or Funding\nIHC until the maturity\nof such financing.\n\nGroup Inc. has\nprovided substantial\namounts of equity and\nsubordinated\nindebtedness, directly\nor indirectly, to its\nregulated\nsubsidiaries. For\nexample, as of June\n2023, Group Inc. had\n$38.22 billion of\nequity and\nsubordinated\nindebtedness invested\nin GS&Co., its\nprincipal U.S.\nregistered broker-\ndealer; $48.01 billion\ninvested in GSI, a\nregulated U.K. broker-\ndealer; $2.24 billion\ninvested in GSJCL, a\nregulated Japanese\nbroker-dealer; $53.85\nbillion invested in GS\nBank USA, a regulated\nNew York State-\nchartered bank; and\n$4.55 billion invested\nin GSIB, a regulated\nU.K. bank. Group Inc.\nalso provides\nfinancing, directly or\nindirectly, in the\nform of: $127.89\nbillion of\nunsubordinated loans\n(including secured\nloans of $43.45\nbillion) and $32.99\nbillion of collateral\nand cash deposits to\nthese entities as of\nJune 2023. In\naddition, as of June\n2023, Group Inc. had\nsignificant amounts of\ncapital invested in\nand loans to its other\nregulated\nsubsidiaries.\n\nContingency Funding\nPlan. We maintain a\ncontingency funding\nplan to provide a\nframework for\nanalyzing and\nresponding to a\nliquidity crisis\nsituation or periods\nof market stress. Our\ncontingency funding\nplan outlines a list\nof potential risk\nfactors, key reports\nand metrics that are\nreviewed on an ongoing\nbasis to assist in\nassessing the severity\nof, and managing\nthrough, a liquidity\ncrisis and/or market\ndislocation. The\ncontingency funding\nplan also describes in\ndetail our potential\nresponses if our\nassessments indicate\nthat we have entered a\nliquidity crisis,\nwhich include pre-\nfunding for what we\nestimate will be our\npotential cash and\ncollateral needs, as\nwell as utilizing\nsecondary sources of\nliquidity. Mitigants\nand action items to\naddress specific risks\nwhich may arise are\nalso described and\nassigned to\nindividuals\nresponsible for\nexecution.\n\nThe contingency\nfunding plan\nidentifies key groups\nof individuals and\ntheir\nresponsibilities,\nwhich include\nfostering effective\ncoordination, control\nand distribution of\ninformation,\nimplementing liquidity\nmaintenance activities\nand managing internal\nand external\ncommunication, all of\nwhich are critical in\nthe management of a\ncrisis or period of\nmarket stress.\nStress Tests\nIn order to determine\nthe appropriate size\nof our GCLA, we model\nliquidity outflows\nover a range of\nscenarios and time\nhorizons. One of our\nprimary internal\nliquidity risk models,\nreferred to as the\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow, quantifies\nour liquidity risks\nover a 30-day stress\nscenario. We also\nconsider other\nfactors, including,\nbut not limited to, an\nassessment of our\npotential intraday\nliquidity needs\nthrough an additional\ninternal liquidity\nrisk model, referred\nto as the Intraday\nLiquidity Model, the\nresults of our long-\nterm stress testing\nmodels, our resolution\nliquidity models and\nother applicable\nregulatory\nrequirements and a\nqualitative assessment\nof our condition, as\nwell as the financial\nmarkets. The results\nof the Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow, the\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel, the long-term\nstress testing models\nand the resolution\nliquidity models are\nreported to senior\nmanagement on a\nregular basis. We also\nperform firmwide\nstress tests.

Our Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow is\nbased on conducting\nmultiple scenarios\nthat include\ncombinations of\nmarket-wide and firm-\nspecific stress. These\nscenarios are\ncharacterized by the\nfollowing qualitative\nelements:\n\n\u2022 Severely challenged\nmarket environments,\nwhich include low\nconsumer and corporate\nconfidence, financial\nand political\ninstability, and\nadverse changes in\nmarket values,\nincluding potential\ndeclines in equity\nmarkets and widening\nof credit spreads; and\n\n\u2022 A firm-specific\ncrisis potentially\ntriggered by material\nlosses, reputational\ndamage, litigation\nand/or a ratings\ndowngrade.\n\nThe following are key\nmodeling elements of\nour Modeled Liquidity\nOutflow:\n\n\u2022 Liquidity needs over\na 30-day scenario;\n\n\u2022 A two-notch\ndowngrade of our long-\nterm senior unsecured\ncredit ratings;\n\n\u2022 Changing conditions\nin funding markets,\nwhich limit our access\nto unsecured and\nsecured funding;\n\n\u2022 No support from\nadditional government\nfunding facilities.\nAlthough we have\naccess to various\ncentral bank funding\nprograms, we do not\nassume reliance on\nadditional sources of\nfunding in a liquidity\ncrisis; and\n\n\u2022 A combination of\ncontractual outflows\nand contingent\noutflows arising from\nboth our on- and off-\nbalance sheet\narrangements.\nContractual outflows\ninclude, among other\nthings, upcoming\nmaturities of\nunsecured debt, term\ndeposits and secured\nfunding. Contingent\noutflows include,\namong other things,\nthe withdrawal of\ncustomer credit\nbalances in our prime\nbrokerage business,\nincrease in variation\nmargin requirements\ndue to adverse changes\nin the value of our\nexchange-traded and\nOTC-cleared\nderivatives, draws on\nunfunded commitments\nand withdrawals of\ndeposits that have no\ncontractual maturity.\nSee notes to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements for further\ninformation about\ncontractual outflows,\nincluding Note 11 for\ncollateralized\nfinancings, Note 13\nfor deposits, Note 14\nfor unsecured long-\nterm borrowings and\nNote 15 for operating\nlease payments, and\n\u201cOff-Balance Sheet\nArrangements\u201d for\nfurther information\nabout our various\ntypes of off-balance\nsheet arrangements.\n\nIntraday Liquidity\nModel. Our Intraday\nLiquidity Model\nmeasures our intraday\nliquidity needs in a\nscenario where access\nto sources of intraday\nliquidity may become\nconstrained. The\nintraday liquidity\nmodel considers a\nvariety of factors,\nincluding historical\nsettlement activity.\n\nLong-Term Stress\nTesting. We utilize\nlonger-term stress\ntests to take a\nforward view on our\nliquidity position\nthrough prolonged\nstress periods in\nwhich we experience a\nsevere liquidity\nstress and recover in\nan environment that\ncontinues to be\nchallenging. We are\nfocused on ensuring\nconservative asset-\nliability management\nto prepare for a\nprolonged period of\npotential stress,\nseeking to maintain a\ndiversified funding\nprofile with an\nappropriate tenor,\ntaking into\nconsideration the\ncharacteristics and\nliquidity profile of\nour assets.\n\nResolution Liquidity\nModels. In connection\nwith our resolution\nplanning efforts, we\nhave established our\nResolution Liquidity\nAdequacy and\nPositioning framework,\nwhich estimates\nliquidity needs of our\nmajor subsidiaries in\na stressed\nenvironment. The\nliquidity needs are\nmeasured using our\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow assumptions\nand include certain\nadditional inter-\naffiliate exposures.\nWe have also\nestablished our\nResolution Liquidity\nExecution Need\nframework, which\nmeasures the liquidity\nneeds of our major\nsubsidiaries to\nstabilize and wind\ndown following a Group\nInc. bankruptcy filing\nin accordance with our\npreferred resolution\nstrategy.\n\nIn addition, we have\nestablished a triggers\nand alerts framework,\nwhich is designed to\nprovide the Board with\ninformation needed to\nmake an informed\ndecision on whether\nand when to commence\nbankruptcy proceedings\nfor Group Inc.\n                                              \n  Limits                                      \n                                              \nWe use liquidity risk\nlimits at various\nlevels and across\nliquidity risk types\nto manage the size of\nour liquidity\nexposures. Limits are\nmeasured relative to\nacceptable levels of\nrisk given our\nliquidity risk\ntolerance. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about the\nlimit approval\nprocess.\n\nLimits are monitored\nby Treasury and\nLiquidity Risk.\nLiquidity Risk is\nresponsible for\nidentifying and\nescalating to senior\nmanagement and/or the\nappropriate risk\ncommittee, on a timely\nbasis, instances where\nlimits have been\nexceeded.\n                                              \n  GCLA and Unencumbered Metrics               \n                                              \nGCLA.

We\nmaintain our GCLA to\nenable us to meet\ncurrent and potential\nliquidity requirements\nof our parent company,\nGroup Inc., and its\nsubsidiaries. Our\nModeled Liquidity\nOutflow and Intraday\nLiquidity Model\nincorporate a\nrequirement for Group\nInc., as well as a\nstandalone requirement\nfor each of our major\nbroker-dealer and bank\nsubsidiaries. Funding\nIHC is required to\nprovide the necessary\nliquidity to Group\nInc. during the\nordinary course of\nbusiness, and is also\nobligated to provide\ncapital and liquidity\nsupport to major\nsubsidiaries in the\nevent of our material\nfinancial distress or\nfailure.

Liquidity\nRegulatory Framework\nAs a BHC, we are\nsubject to a minimum\nLiquidity Coverage\nRatio (LCR) under the\nLCR rule approved by\nthe U.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies.\nThe LCR rule requires\norganizations to\nmaintain an adequate\nratio of eligible\nhigh-quality liquid\nassets (HQLA) to\nexpected net cash\noutflows under an\nacute, short-term\nliquidity stress\nscenario. Eligible\nHQLA excludes HQLA\nheld by subsidiaries\nthat is in excess of\ntheir minimum\nrequirement and is\nsubject to transfer\nrestrictions. We are\nrequired to maintain a\nminimum LCR of 100%.\nWe expect that\nfluctuations in client\nactivity, business mix\nand the market\nenvironment will\nimpact our LCR.

Certain of our derivatives have\nbeen transacted under bilateral agreements\nwith counterparties who may require us to post\ncollateral or terminate the transactions based\non changes in our credit ratings. We manage\nour GCLA to ensure we would, among other\npotential requirements, be able to make the\nadditional collateral or termination payments\nthat may be required in the event of a two-\nnotch reduction in our long-term credit\nratings, as well as collateral that has not\nbeen called by counterparties, but is\navailable to them. See Note 7 to the\nconsolidated financial statements for further\ninformation about derivatives with credit-\nrelated contingent features and the additional\ncollateral or termination payments related to\nour net derivative liabilities under bilateral\nagreements that could have been called by\ncounterparties in the event of a one- or two-\nnotch downgrade in our credit ratings.\n\nCash Flows As a global financial institution,\nour cash flows are complex and bear little\nrelation to our net earnings and net assets.\nConsequently, we believe that traditional cash\nflow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating\nour liquidity position than the liquidity and\nasset-liability management policies described\nabove. Cash flow analysis may, however, be\nhelpful in highlighting certain macro trends\nand strategic initiatives in our businesses.\nSix Months Ended June 2023. Our cash and cash\nequivalents increased by $29.11 billion to\n$270.93 billion at the end of the second\nquarter of 2023, primarily due to net cash\nprovided by operating activities, partially\noffset by net cash used for financing\nactivities and investing activities. The net\ncash provided by operating activities\nprimarily reflected cash inflows from\ncollateralized transactions (reflecting both\nan increase in collateralized financings and a\ndecrease in collateralized agreements),\npartially offset by cash outflows from trading\nassets and customer and other receivables and\npayables, net (reflecting both an increase in\ncustomer and other receivables and a decrease\nin customer and other payables). The net cash\nused for financing activities primarily\nreflected cash outflows from net repayments of\nunsecured long-term borrowings, partially\noffset by cash inflows from deposits (due to\nincreases in consumer deposits and brokered\ncertificates of deposit, partially offset by a\ndecrease in private bank deposits). The net\ncash used for investing activities primarily\nreflected net purchases of investments\n(primarily U.S. government obligations\naccounted for as held-to-maturity and\navailable-for-sale securities). Six Months\nEnded June 2022 . Our cash and cash\nequivalents increased by $27.57 billion to\n$288.61 billion at the end of the second\nquarter of 2022, due to net cash provided by\nfinancing and operating activities, partially\noffset by net cash used for investing\nactivities and the effect of exchange rate\nchanges on cash and cash equivalents. The net\ncash provided by financing activities\nprimarily reflected cash inflows from deposits\n(reflecting increases in transaction banking,\nbrokered certificates of deposit and deposit\nsweep program balances, and a decrease in\nprivate bank deposits) and net issuance of\nunsecured long-term borrowings. The net cash\nprovided by operating activities primarily\nreflected cash inflows from trading\nliabilities and customer and other receivables\nand payables, net (reflecting both an increase\nin customer and other payables and in customer\nand other receivables), partially offset by\ncash outflows from collateralized transactions\n(reflecting an increase in collateralized\nagreements and a decrease in collateralized\nfinancings) and trading assets. The net cash\nused for investing activities primarily\nreflected purchases of investments (primarily\ndue to an increase in U.S. government\nobligations accounted for as held-to-maturity)\nand an increase in net lending activities\n(reflecting increases across the portfolio).\nThe decrease in net cash and cash equivalents\nas a result of changes in foreign exchange\nrates was due to the U.S. dollar strengthening\nduring the first half of 2022.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q    148  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis        \n                                              \nWe are aware of the\ninherent limitations\nto VaR and therefore\nuse a variety of risk\nmeasures in our market\nrisk management\nprocess. Inherent\nlimitations to VaR\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 VaR does not\nestimate potential\nlosses over longer\ntime horizons where\nmoves may be extreme;\n\n\u2022 VaR does not take\naccount of the\nrelative liquidity of\ndifferent risk\npositions; and\n\n\u2022 Previous moves in\nmarket risk factors\nmay not produce\naccurate predictions\nof all future market\nmoves.\n\nTo comprehensively\ncapture our exposures\nand relevant risks in\nour VaR calculation,\nwe use historical\nsimulations with full\nvaluation of market\nfactors at the\nposition level by\nsimultaneously\nshocking the relevant\nmarket factors for\nthat position. These\nmarket factors include\nspot prices, credit\nspreads, funding\nspreads, yield curves,\nvolatility and\ncorrelation, and are\nupdated periodically\nbased on changes in\nthe composition of\npositions, as well as\nvariations in market\nconditions. We sample\nfrom five years of\nhistorical data to\ngenerate the scenarios\nfor our VaR\ncalculation. The\nhistorical data is\nweighted so that the\nrelative importance of\nthe data reduces over\ntime. This gives\ngreater importance to\nmore recent\nobservations and\nreflects current asset\nvolatilities, which\nimproves the accuracy\nof our estimates of\npotential loss. As a\nresult, even if our\npositions included in\nVaR were unchanged,\nour VaR would increase\nwith increasing market\nvolatility and vice\nversa.\n\nGiven its reliance on\nhistorical data, VaR\nis most effective in\nestimating risk\nexposures in markets\nin which there are no\nsudden fundamental\nchanges or shifts in\nmarket conditions.\n\nOur VaR measure does\nnot include:\n\n\u2022 Positions that are\nnot accounted for at\nfair value, such as\nheld-to-maturity\nsecurities and loans,\ndeposits and unsecured\nborrowings that are\naccounted for at\namortized cost;\n\n\u2022 Available-for-sale\nsecurities for which\nthe related unrealized\nfair value gains and\nlosses are included in\naccumulated other\ncomprehensive\nincome/(loss);\n\n\u2022 Positions that are\nbest measured and\nmonitored using\nsensitivity measures;\nand\n\n\u2022 The impact of\nchanges in\ncounterparty and our\nown credit spreads on\nderivatives, as well\nas changes in our own\ncredit spreads on\nfinancial liabilities\nfor which the fair\nvalue option was\nelected.\n\nWe perform daily\nbacktesting of our VaR\nmodel (i.e., comparing\ndaily net revenues for\npositions included in\nVaR to the VaR measure\ncalculated as of the\nprior business day) at\nthe firmwide level and\nfor each of our\nbusinesses and major\nregulated\nsubsidiaries.\n\nEarnings-at-Risk. We\nmanage our interest\nrate risk using the\nEaR metric. EaR\nmeasures the estimated\nimpact of changes in\ninterest rates to our\nnet revenues and\npreferred stock\ndividends over a\ndefined time horizon.\nEaR complements the\nVaR metric, which\nmeasures the impact of\ninterest rate changes\nthat have an immediate\nimpact on the fair\nvalues of our assets\nand liabilities (i.e.,\nmark-to-market\nchanges). Our exposure\nto interest rate risk\noccurs due to a\nvariety of factors,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to:\n\n\u2022 Differences in\nmaturity or repricing\ndates of assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock and certain off-\nbalance sheet\ninstruments.\n\n\u2022 Differences in the\namounts of assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock and certain off-\nbalance sheet\ninstruments with the\nsame maturity or\nrepricing dates.\n\n\u2022 Certain interest\nrate sensitive fees.\n\nTreasury manages the\naggregated interest\nrate risk from all\nbusinesses through our\ninvestment securities\nportfolio and interest\nrate derivatives. We\nmeasure EaR over a\none-year time horizon\nfollowing a 100-basis\npoint instantaneous\nparallel shock in both\nshort- and long-term\ninterest rates. This\nsensitivity is\ncalculated relative to\na baseline market\nscenario, which takes\ninto consideration,\namong other things,\nthe market\u2019s\nexpectation of forward\nrates, as well as our\nexpectation of future\nbusiness activity.\nThis scenario includes\ncontractual elements\nof assets,\nliabilities, preferred\nstock, and certain\noff-balance sheet\ninstruments, such as\nrates of interest,\nprincipal repayment\nschedules, maturity\nand reset dates, and\nany interest rate\nceilings or floors, as\nwell as assumptions\nwith respect to our\nbalance sheet size and\ncomposition, deposit\nrepricing and\nprepayment behavior.\nWe manage EaR with a\ngoal to reduce\npotential volatility\nresulting from changes\nin interest rates so\nit remains within our\nEaR risk appetite. Our\nEaR scenario is\nregularly evaluated\nand updated, if\nnecessary, to reflect\nchanges in our\nbusiness plans, market\nconditions and other\nmacroeconomic factors.\nWhile management uses\nthe best information\navailable to estimate\nEaR, actual results\nmay differ materially\nas a result of, among\nother things, changes\nin the economic\nenvironment or\nassumptions used in\nthe process.\n\nRisk, which is\nindependent of our\nrevenue-producing\nunits, and Treasury,\nhave primary\nresponsibility for\nassessing and\nmonitoring EaR through\nfirmwide oversight,\nincluding oversight of\nEaR stress testing and\nassumptions, and the\nestablishment of our\nEaR risk appetite.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q    150  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Stress\ntesting is a method of\ndetermining the effect\nof various\nhypothetical stress\nscenarios. In addition\nto EaR, we use other\nstress tests to\nexamine risks of\nspecific portfolios,\nas well as the\npotential impact of\nour significant risk\nexposures. We use a\nvariety of stress\ntesting techniques to\ncalculate the\npotential loss from a\nwide range of market\nmoves on our\nportfolios, including\nfirmwide stress tests,\nsensitivity analysis\nand scenario analysis.\nThe results of our\nvarious stress tests\nare analyzed together\nfor risk management\npurposes. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about\nfirmwide stress tests.\nSensitivity analysis\nis used to quantify\nthe impact of a market\nmove in a single risk\nfactor across all\npositions (e.g.,\nequity prices or\ncredit spreads) using\na variety of defined\nmarket shocks, ranging\nfrom those that could\nbe expected over a\none-day time horizon\nup to those that could\ntake many months to\noccur. We also use\nsensitivity analysis\nto quantify the impact\nof the default of any\nsingle entity, which\ncaptures the risk of\nlarge or concentrated\nexposures. Scenario\nanalysis is used to\nquantify the impact of\na specified event,\nincluding how the\nevent impacts multiple\nrisk factors\nsimultaneously. For\nexample, for sovereign\nstress testing we\ncalculate potential\ndirect exposure\nassociated with our\nsovereign positions,\nas well as the\ncorresponding debt,\nequity and currency\nexposures associated\nwith our non-sovereign\npositions that may be\nimpacted by the\nsovereign distress.\nWhen conducting\nscenario analysis, we\noften consider a\nnumber of possible\noutcomes for each\nscenario, ranging from\nmoderate to severely\nadverse market\nimpacts. In addition,\nthese stress tests are\nconstructed using both\nhistorical events and\nforward-looking\nhypothetical\nscenarios. Unlike VaR\nmeasures, which have\nan implied probability\nbecause they are\ncalculated at a\nspecified confidence\nlevel, there may not\nbe an implied\nprobability that our\nstress testing\nscenarios will occur.\nInstead, stress\ntesting is used to\nmodel both moderate\nand more extreme moves\nin underlying market\nfactors. When\nestimating potential\nloss, we generally\nassume that our\npositions cannot be\nreduced or hedged\n(although experience\ndemonstrates that we\nare generally able to\ndo so). Limits We use\nmarket risk limits at\nvarious levels to\nmanage the size of our\nmarket exposures.\nThese limits are set\nbased on VaR, EaR and\non a range of stress\ntests relevant to our\nexposures. See\n\u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for\ninformation about the\nlimit approval\nprocess.\n\nLimits are monitored\nby Treasury and Risk.\nRisk is responsible\nfor identifying and\nescalating to senior\nmanagement and/or the\nappropriate risk\ncommittee, on a timely\nbasis, instances where\nlimits have been\nexceeded (e.g., due to\npositional changes or\nchanges in market\nconditions, such as\nincreased volatilities\nor changes in\ncorrelations). Such\ninstances are\nremediated by a\nreduction in the\npositions we hold\nand/or a temporary or\npermanent increase to\nthe limit, if\nwarranted. Metrics We\nanalyze VaR at the\nfirmwide level and a\nvariety of more\ndetailed levels,\nincluding by risk\ncategory, business and\nregion.\nDiversification effect\nin the tables below\nrepresents the\ndifference between\ntotal VaR and the sum\nof the VaRs for the\nfour risk categories.\nThis effect arises\nbecause the four\nmarket risk categories\nare not perfectly\ncorrelated. During the\nfirst quarter of 2023,\nwe added the currency\nexposure on certain\ndebt and equity\npositions to VaR and\nremoved certain debt\nand equity positions\n(and related hedges)\nfrom VaR as our\nmanagement believes\nthat the risk of these\npositions is more\nappropriately measured\nand monitored using\n10% sensitivity\nmeasures.

Credit Risk Management Overview Credit\nrisk represents the potential for loss due to\nthe default or deterioration in credit quality\nof a counterparty (e.g., an OTC derivatives\ncounterparty or a borrower) or an issuer of\nsecurities or other instruments we hold. Our\nexposure to credit risk comes mostly from\nclient transactions in OTC derivatives and\nloans and lending commitments. Credit risk\nalso comes from cash placed with banks,\nsecurities financing transactions (i.e.,\nresale and repurchase agreements and\nsecurities borrowing and lending activities)\nand customer and other receivables.\n\nCredit Risk, which is independent of our\nrevenue-producing units and reports to our\nchief risk officer, has primary responsibility\nfor assessing, monitoring and managing our\ncredit risk through firmwide oversight across\nour global businesses. In addition, we hold\nother positions that give rise to credit risk\n(e.g., bonds and secondary bank loans). These\ncredit risks are captured as a component of\nmarket risk measures, which are monitored and\nmanaged by Market Risk. We also enter into\nderivatives to manage market risk exposures.\nSuch derivatives also give rise to credit\nrisk, which is monitored and managed by Credit\nRisk. Credit Risk Management Process Our\nprocess for managing credit risk includes the\ncritical components of our risk management\nframework described in the \u201cOverview and\nStructure of Risk Management,\u201d as well as the\nfollowing: \u2022 Monitoring compliance with\nestablished credit risk limits and reporting\nour credit exposures and credit\nconcentrations; \u2022 Establishing or approving\nunderwriting standards; \u2022 Assessing the\nlikelihood that a counterparty will default on\nits payment obligations; \u2022 Measuring our\ncurrent and potential credit exposure and\nlosses resulting from a counterparty default;\n\u2022 Using credit risk mitigants, including\ncollateral and hedging; and \u2022 Maximizing\nrecovery through active workout and\nrestructuring of claims. We also perform\ncredit analyses, which incorporate initial and\nongoing evaluations of the capacity and\nwillingness of a counterparty to meet its\nfinancial obligations. For substantially all\nof our credit exposures, the core of our\nprocess is an annual counterparty credit\nevaluation or more frequently if deemed\nnecessary as a result of events or changes in\ncircumstances. We determine an internal credit\nrating for the counterparty by considering the\nresults of the credit evaluations and\nassumptions with respect to the nature of and\noutlook for the counterparty\u2019s industry and\nthe economic environment. Beginning in the\nfirst quarter of 2023, we also take into\nconsideration collateral received or other\ncredit support arrangements when determining\nan internal credit rating for collateralized\nloans, as management believes that this\nmethodology better reflects the credit quality\nof the underlying loans and lending\ncommitments. Prior period amounts have been\nconformed to reflect the current methodology.\nSenior personnel, with expertise in specific\nindustries, inspect and approve credit reviews\nand internal credit ratings. Our risk\nassessment process may also include, where\napplicable, reviewing certain key metrics,\nincluding, but not limited to, delinquency\nstatus, collateral value, FICO credit scores\nand other risk factors.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q    154  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These shocks\ncover a wide range of\nmoderate and more\nextreme market\nmovements, including\nshocks to multiple\nrisk factors,\nconsistent with the\noccurrence of a severe\nmarket or economic\nevent. In the case of\nsovereign default, we\nestimate the direct\nimpact of the default\non our sovereign\ncredit exposures,\nchanges to our credit\nexposures arising from\npotential market moves\nin response to the\ndefault, and the\nimpact of credit\nmarket deterioration\non corporate borrowers\nand counterparties\nthat may result from\nthe sovereign default.\nUnlike potential\nexposure, which is\ncalculated within a\nspecified confidence\nlevel, stress testing\ndoes not generally\nassume a probability\nof these events\noccurring.

OTC Derivatives.\nOur credit exposure on\nOTC derivatives arises\nprimarily from our\nmarket-making\nactivities. As a\nmarket maker, we enter\ninto derivative\ntransactions to\nprovide liquidity to\nclients and to\nfacilitate the\ntransfer and hedging\nof their risks. We\nalso enter into\nderivatives to manage\nmarket risk exposures.\nWe manage our credit\nexposure on OTC\nderivatives using the\ncredit risk process,\nmeasures, limits and\nrisk mitigants\ndescribed above.\n\nWe generally enter\ninto OTC derivatives\ntransactions under\nbilateral collateral\narrangements that\nrequire the daily\nexchange of\ncollateral. As credit\nrisk is an essential\ncomponent of fair\nvalue, we include a\nCVA in the fair value\nof derivatives to\nreflect counterparty\ncredit risk, as\ndescribed in Note 7 to\nthe consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nCVA is a function of\nthe present value of\nexpected exposure, the\nprobability of\ncounterparty default\nand the assumed\nrecovery upon default.\nThe table below\npresents our net\ncredit exposure from\nOTC derivatives and\nthe concentration by\nindustry and region.\n                                              \n               As of                          \n                      June    December        \n  $ in                2023              2022  \n  millio\u2026                                     \n  OTC                                         \n  deriva\u2026    $45,358           $53,399        \n  assets                                      \n  Collat\u2026                                     \n  (not                                        \n  netted     -15,053           -15,823        \n  under                                       \n  U.S.                                        \n  GAAP)                                       \n  Net                                         \n  credit     $30,305           $37,576        \n  exposu\u2026                                     \n  Indust\u2026                                     \n  Consum\u2026                                     \n  &                4     %           3     %  \n  Retail                                      \n  Divers\u2026         12     %           8     %  \n  Indust\u2026                                     \n  Financ\u2026         20     %          20     %  \n  Instit\u2026                                     \n  Funds           22     %          19     %  \n  Health\u2026          1     %           1     %  \n  Munici\u2026                                     \n  &                4     %           2     %  \n  Nonpro\u2026                                     \n  Natural                                     \n  Resour\u2026         20     %          34     %  \n  &                                           \n  Utilit\u2026                                     \n  Sovere\u2026         12     %           7     %  \n  Techno\u2026                                     \n  Media &          5     %           4     %  \n  Teleco\u2026                                     \n  Other                                       \n  (inclu\u2026                                     \n  Special                \u2013           2     %  \n  Purpose                                     \n  Vehicl\u2026                                     \n  Total          100     %         100     %  \n  Region                                      \n  Americ\u2026         43     %          49     %  \n  EMEA            47     %          43     %  \n  Asia            10     %           8     %  \n  Total          100     %         100     %  \n                                              \nOur credit exposure\n(before any potential\nrecoveries) to OTC\nderivative\ncounterparties that\ndefaulted during the\nsix months ended June\n2023 remained low,\nrepresenting less than\n2% of our total credit\nexposure from OTC\nderivatives.

Prior period\namounts have been\nconformed to reflect\nthe current\nmethodology.

In\naddition, we also have\ncredit exposure to\nother loans held for\nsecuritization of\n$1.46 billion as of\nJune 2023 and $1.76\nbillion as of December\n2022. Such loans are\nincluded in trading\nassets in our\nconsolidated balance\nsheets. Credit Hedges.\nTo mitigate the credit\nrisk associated with\nour lending\nactivities, we obtain\ncredit protection on\ncertain loans and\nlending commitments\nthrough credit default\nswaps, both single-\nname and index-based\ncontracts, and through\nthe issuance of\ncredit-linked notes.\n\nSecurities Financing\nTransactions. We enter\ninto securities\nfinancing transactions\nin order to, among\nother things,\nfacilitate client\nactivities, invest\nexcess cash, acquire\nsecurities to cover\nshort positions and\nfinance certain\nactivities. We bear\ncredit risk related to\nresale agreements and\nsecurities borrowed\nonly to the extent\nthat cash advanced or\nthe value of\nsecurities pledged or\ndelivered to the\ncounterparty exceeds\nthe value of the\ncollateral received.\nWe also have credit\nexposure on repurchase\nagreements and\nsecurities loaned to\nthe extent that the\nvalue of securities\npledged or delivered\nto the counterparty\nfor these transactions\nexceeds the amount of\ncash or collateral\nreceived. Securities\ncollateral for these\ntransactions primarily\nincludes U.S. and\nnon-U.S. government\nand agency\nobligations.

We are\nexposed to credit risk\nfrom our receivables\nfrom brokers, dealers\nand clearing\norganizations and\ncustomers and\ncounterparties.\nReceivables from\nbrokers, dealers and\nclearing organizations\nprimarily consist of\ninitial margin placed\nwith clearing\norganizations and\nreceivables related to\nsales of securities\nwhich have traded, but\nnot yet settled. These\nreceivables generally\nhave minimal credit\nrisk due to the low\nprobability of\nclearing organization\ndefault and the short-\nterm nature of\nreceivables related to\nsecurities\nsettlements.\nReceivables from\ncustomers and\ncounterparties\ngenerally consist of\ncollateralized\nreceivables related to\ncustomer securities\ntransactions and\ngenerally have minimal\ncredit risk due to\nboth the value of the\ncollateral received\nand the short-term\nnature of these\nreceivables.

Credit exposure represents\nthe potential for loss due to the default or\ndeterioration in credit quality of a\ncounterparty or borrower. Market exposure\nrepresents the potential for loss in value of\nour long and short positions due to changes in\nmarket prices.\n\nCountry Exposures. The Russian invasion of\nUkraine has negatively affected the global\neconomy and resulted in significant\ndisruptions in financial markets and increased\nmacroeconomic uncertainty. The extent and\nduration of the war, sanctions and resulting\nmarket disruptions, as well as the potential\nadverse consequences for our business,\nliquidity and results of operations, are\ndifficult to predict. Our senior management\nreceives regular briefings from our\nindependent risk oversight and control\nfunctions on Russian and Ukrainian exposures,\nas well as other relevant risk metrics. We\nhave significantly reduced our exposure to\nRussia and Ukraine and have curtailed our\noperations in Russia to those necessary to\nmeet our legal and regulatory obligations. The\noverall direct financial impact to our net\nrevenues for the first half of 2023 from\nRussian and Ukrainian counterparties,\nborrowers, issuers and related instruments was\nnot material. We have established a firmwide\nworking group to identify and assess the\noperational risk associated with complying\nwith economic sanctions and restrictions as a\nresult of this invasion. In addition, to\nmitigate the risk of increased cyber attacks,\nwe liaise with government agencies in order to\nupdate our monitoring processes with the\nlatest information. Our total credit exposure\nto Russian or Ukrainian counterparties or\nborrowers and our total market exposure\nrelating to Russian or Ukrainian issuers was\nnot material as of June 2023. See \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form\n10-K for further information about our risks\nrelated to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nEconomic challenges persist for the Argentine\ngovernment given uncertainty relating to its\nfiscal and economic policies due to upcoming\nelections. As of June 2023, our total credit\nexposure to Argentina was not material. Our\ntotal market exposure to Argentina as of June\n2023 was $161 million, primarily to sovereign\nissuers. Such exposure consisted of $94\nmillion related to debt, $(4) million related\nto credit derivatives and $71 million related\nto equities. In addition, economic and/or\npolitical unc ertainties in Ethiopia, Ghana,\nLebanon, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Venezuela\nhave led to concerns about their financial\nstability. Our credit exposure to\ncounterparties or borrowers and our market\nexposure to issuers relating to each of these\ncountries was not material as of June 2023.\n                                            \n  Goldman Sachs June 2023 Form 10-Q    162  \n                                            \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.
