The firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by\nfirst evaluating whether the entity is a      \nvoting interest entity or a variable interest \nentity (VIE). Voting Interest Entities. Voting\ninterest entities are entities in which (i)   \nthe total equity investment at risk is        \nsufficient to enable the entity to finance its\nactivities independently and (ii) the equity  \nholders have the power to direct the          \nactivities of the entity that most            \nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nthe obligation to absorb the losses of the    \nentity and the right to receive the residual  \nreturns of the entity. The usual condition for\na controlling financial interest in a voting  \ninterest entity is ownership of a majority    \nvoting interest. If the firm has a controlling\nmajority voting interest in a voting interest \nentity, the entity is consolidated. Variable  \nInterest Entities. A VIE is an entity that    \nlacks one or more of the characteristics of a \nvoting interest entity. The firm has a        \ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE when  \nthe firm has a variable interest or interests \nthat provide it with (i) the power to direct  \nthe activities of the VIE that most           \nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic       \nperformance and (ii) the obligation to absorb \nlosses of the VIE or the right to receive     \nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially  \nbe significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for    \nfurther information about VIEs. Equity-Method \nInvestments. When the firm does not have a    \ncontrolling financial interest in an entity   \nbut can exert significant influence over the  \nentity\u2019s operating and financial policies, the\ninvestment is generally accounted for at fair \nvalue by electing the fair value option       \navailable under U.S. GAAP. Significant        \ninfluence generally exists when the firm owns \n20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock or in-\nsubstancecommon stock. In certain cases, the  \nfirm applies the equity method of accounting  \nto new investments that are strategic in      \nnature or closely related to the firm\u2019s       \nprincipal business activities, when the firm  \nhas a significant degree of involvement in the\ncash flows or operations of the investee or   \nwhen cost-benefit considerations are less     \nsignificant. See Note 8 for further           \ninformation about equity-method investments.  \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    6  \n                                           \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Investment Funds. The firm has    \nformed investment funds with third-party      \ninvestors. These funds are typically organized\nas limited partnerships or limited liability  \ncompanies for which the firm acts as general  \npartner or manager. Generally, the firm does  \nnot hold a majority of the economic interests \nin these funds. These funds are usually voting\ninterest entities and generally are not       \nconsolidated because third-party investors    \ntypically have rights to terminate the funds  \nor to remove the firm as general partner or   \nmanager. Investments in these funds are       \ngenerally measured at net asset value (NAV)   \nand are included in investments. See Notes 8, \n18 and 22 for further information about       \ninvestments in funds. Use of Estimates        \nPreparation of these consolidated financial   \nstatements requires management to make certain\nestimates and assumptions, the most important \nof which relate to fair value measurements,   \nthe allowance for credit losses on loans and  \nlending commitments accounted for at amortized\ncost, discretionary compensation accruals,    \naccounting for goodwill and identifiable      \nintangible assets, provisions for losses that \nmay arise from litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings (including governmental           \ninvestigations), and provisions for losses    \nthat may arise from tax audits. These         \nestimates and assumptions are based on the    \nbest available information but actual results \ncould be materially different. Revenue        \nRecognition Financial Assets and Liabilities  \nat Fair Value. Trading assets and liabilities \nand certain investments are recorded at fair  \nvalue either under the fair value option or in\naccordance with other U.S. GAAP. In addition, \nthe firm has elected to account for certain of\nits loans and other financial assets and      \nliabilities at fair value by electing the fair\nvalue option. The fair value of a financial   \ninstrument is the amount that would be        \nreceived to sell an asset or paid to transfer \na liability in an orderly transaction between \nmarket participants at the measurement date.  \nFinancial assets are marked to bid prices and \nfinancial liabilities are marked to offer     \nprices. Fair value measurements do not include\ntransaction costs. Fair value gains or losses \nare generally included in market making or    \nother principal transactions. See Note 4 for  \nfurther information about fair value          \nmeasurements. Revenue from Contracts with     \nClients. The firm recognizes revenue earned   \nfrom contracts with clients for services, such\nas investment banking, investment management, \nand execution and clearing (contracts with    \nclients), when the performance obligations    \nrelated to the underlying transaction are     \ncompleted. Revenues from contracts with       \nclients represent approximately 35% of total  \nnon-interestrevenues (including approximately \n90% of investment banking revenues,           \napproximately 95% of investment management    \nrevenues and all commissions and fees) for the\nthree months ended March 2021, and            \napproximately 55% of total non-               \ninterestrevenues (including approximately 85% \nof investment banking revenues, approximately \n95% of investment management revenues and all \ncommissions and fees) for the three months    \nended March 2020. See Note 25 for information \nabout net revenues by business segment.       \nInvestment Banking Advisory. Fees from        \nfinancial advisory assignments are recognized \nin revenues when the services related to the  \nunderlying transaction are completed under the\nterms of the assignment. Non-                 \nrefundabledeposits and milestone payments in  \nconnection with financial advisory assignments\nare recognized in revenues upon completion of \nthe underlying transaction or when the        \nassignment is otherwise concluded. Expenses   \nassociated with financial advisory assignments\nare recognized when incurred and are included \nin transaction based expenses. Client         \nreimbursements for such expenses are included \nin investment banking revenues. Underwriting. \nFees from underwriting assignments are        \nrecognized in revenues upon completion of the \nunderlying transaction based on the terms of  \nthe assignment. Expenses associated with      \nunderwriting assignments are generally        \ndeferred until the related revenue is         \nrecognized or the assignment is otherwise     \nconcluded. Such expenses are included in      \ntransaction based expenses for completed      \nassignments.                                  \n                                           \n  7    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Investment Management The firm    \nearns management fees and incentive fees for  \ninvestment management services, which are     \nincluded in investment management revenues.   \nThe firm makes payments to brokers and        \nadvisors related to the placement of the      \nfirm\u2019s investment funds (distribution fees),  \nwhich are included in transaction based       \nexpenses. Management Fees. Management fees for\nmutual funds are calculated as a percentage of\ndaily net asset value and are received        \nmonthly. Management fees for hedge funds and  \nseparately managed accounts are calculated as \na percentage of month-endnet asset value and  \nare generally received quarterly. Management  \nfees for private equity funds are calculated  \nas a percentage of monthly invested capital or\ncommitted capital and are received quarterly, \nsemi-annually or annually, depending on the   \nfund. Management fees are recognized over time\nin the period the services are provided.      \nDistribution fees paid by the firm are        \ncalculated based on either a percentage of the\nmanagement fee, the investment fund\u2019s net     \nasset value or the committed capital. Such    \nfees are included in transaction based        \nexpenses. Incentive Fees. Incentive fees are  \ncalculated as a percentage of a fund\u2019s or     \nseparately managed account\u2019s return, or excess\nreturn above a specified benchmark or other   \nperformance target. Incentive fees are        \ngenerally based on investment performance over\na twelve-month period or over the life of a   \nfund. Fees that are based on performance over \na twelve-month period are subject to          \nadjustment prior to the end of the measurement\nperiod. For fees that are based on investment \nperformance over the life of the fund, future \ninvestment underperformance may require fees  \npreviously distributed to the firm to be      \nreturned to the fund. Incentive fees earned   \nfrom a fund or separately managed account are \nrecognized when it is probable that a         \nsignificant reversal of such fees will not    \noccur, which is generally when such fees are  \nno longer subject to fluctuations in the      \nmarket value of investments held by the fund  \nor separately managed account. Therefore,     \nincentive fees recognized during the period   \nmay relate to performance obligations         \nsatisfied in previous periods. Commissions and\nFees The firm earns commissions and fees from \nexecuting and clearing client transactions on \nstock, options and futures markets, as well as\nover-the-counter(OTC) transactions.           \nCommissions and fees are recognized on the day\nthe trade is executed. The firm also provides \nthird-party research services to clients in   \nconnection with certain soft-dollar           \narrangements. Third-party research costs      \nincurred by the firm in connection with such  \narrangements are presented net within         \ncommissions and fees. Remaining Performance   \nObligations Remaining performance obligations \nare services that the firm has committed to   \nperform in the future in connection with its  \ncontracts with clients. The firm\u2019s remaining  \nperformance obligations are generally related \nto its financial advisory assignments and     \ncertain investment management activities.     \nRevenues associated with remaining performance\nobligations relating to financial advisory    \nassignments cannot be determined until the    \noutcome of the transaction. For the firm\u2019s    \ninvestment management activities, where fees  \nare calculated based on the net asset value of\nthe fund or separately managed account, future\nrevenues associated with such remaining       \nperformance obligations cannot be determined  \nas such fees are subject to fluctuations in   \nthe market value of investments held by the   \nfund or separately managed account. The firm  \nis able to determine the future revenues      \nassociated with management fees calculated    \nbased on committed capital. As of March 2021, \nsubstantially all future net revenues         \nassociated with such remaining performance    \nobligations will be recognized through 2028.  \nAnnual revenues associated with such          \nperformance obligations average less than $   \n250million through 2028. Transfers of         \nFinancial Assets Transfers of financial assets\nare accounted for as sales when the firm has  \nrelinquished control over the assets          \ntransferred. For transfers of financial assets\naccounted for as sales, any gains or losses   \nare recognized in net revenues. Assets or     \nliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s        \ncontinuing involvement with transferred       \nfinancial assets are initially recognized at  \nfair value. For transfers of financial assets \nthat are not accounted for as sales, the      \nassets are generally included in trading      \nassets and the transfer is accounted for as a \ncollateralized financing, with the related    \ninterest expense recognized over the life of  \nthe transaction. See Note 11 for further      \ninformation about transfers of financial      \nassets accounted for as collateralized        \nfinancings and Note 16 for further information\nabout transfers of financial assets accounted \nfor as sales.                                 \n                                           \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    8  \n                                           \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Cash and Cash Equivalents The firm\ndefines cash equivalents as highly liquid     \novernight deposits held in the ordinary course\nof business. Cash and cash equivalents        \nincluded cash and due from banks of $         \n11.27billion as of March 2021 and $           \n11.95billion as of December 2020. Cash and    \ncash equivalents also included interest-      \nbearing deposits with banks of $ 179.89billion\nas of March 2021 and $ 143.89billion as of    \nDecember 2020. The firm segregates cash for   \nregulatory and other purposes related to      \nclient activity. Cash and cash equivalents    \nsegregated for regulatory and other purposes  \nwere $ 25.56billion as of March 2021 and $    \n24.52billion as of December 2020. In addition,\nthe firm segregates securities for regulatory \nand other purposes related to client activity.\nSee Note 11 for further information about     \nsegregated securities. Customer and Other     \nReceivables Customer and other receivables    \nincluded receivables from customers and       \ncounterparties of $ 102.46billion as of March \n2021 and $ 82.39billion as of December 2020,  \nand receivables from brokers, dealers and     \nclearing organizations of $ 62.20billion as of\nMarch 2021 and $ 38.94billion as of December  \n2020. Such receivables primarily consist of   \ncustomer margin loans, receivables resulting  \nfrom unsettled transactions and collateral    \nposted in connection with certain derivative  \ntransactions. Substantially all of these      \nreceivables are accounted for at amortized    \ncost net of any allowance for credit losses,  \nwhich generally approximates fair value. As   \nthese receivables are not accounted for at    \nfair value, they are not included in the      \nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through\n10. Had these receivables been included in the\nfirm\u2019s fair value hierarchy, substantially all\nwould have been classified in level 2 as of   \nboth March 2021 and December 2020. See Note 10\nfor further information about customer and    \nother receivables accounted for at fair value \nunder the fair value option. Interest on      \ncustomer and other receivables is recognized  \nover the life of the transaction and included \nin interest income. Customer and other        \nreceivables includes receivables from         \ncontracts with clients and contract assets.   \nContract assets represent the firm\u2019s right to \nreceive consideration for services provided in\nconnection with its contracts with clients for\nwhich collection is conditional and not merely\nsubject to the passage of time. The firm\u2019s    \nreceivables from contracts with clients were $\n2.87billion as of March 2021 and $ 2.60billion\nas of December 2020. As of both March 2021 and\nDecember 2020 contract assets were not        \nmaterial. Customer and Other Payables Customer\nand other payables included payables to       \ncustomers and counterparties of $             \n201.05billion as of March 2021 and $          \n183.57billion as of December 2020, and        \npayables to brokers, dealers and clearing     \norganizations of $ 23.22billion as of March   \n2021 and $ 7.09billion as of December 2020.   \nSuch payables primarily consist of customer   \ncredit balances related to the firm\u2019s prime   \nbrokerage activities. Customer and other      \npayables are accounted for at cost plus       \naccrued interest, which generally approximates\nfair value. As these payables are not         \naccounted for at fair value, they are not     \nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in\nNotes 4 through 10. Had these payables been   \nincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy,  \nsubstantially all would have been classified  \nin level 2 as of both March 2021 and December \n2020. Interest on customer and other payables \nis recognized over the life of the transaction\nand included in interest expense. Offsetting  \nAssets and Liabilities To reduce credit       \nexposures on derivatives and securities       \nfinancing transactions, the firm may enter    \ninto master netting agreements or similar     \narrangements (collectively, netting           \nagreements) with counterparties that permit it\nto offset receivables and payables with such  \ncounterparties. A netting agreement is a      \ncontract with a counterparty that permits net \nsettlement of multiple transactions with that \ncounterparty, including upon the exercise of  \ntermination rights by a non-defaultingparty.  \nUpon exercise of such termination rights, all \ntransactions governed by the netting agreement\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is \ncalculated. In addition, the firm receives and\nposts cash and securities collateral with     \nrespect to its derivatives and securities     \nfinancing transactions, subject to the terms  \nof the related credit support agreements or   \nsimilar arrangements (collectively, credit    \nsupport agreements). An enforceable credit    \nsupport agreement grants the non-             \ndefaultingparty exercising termination rights \nthe right to liquidate the collateral and     \napply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In    \norder to assess enforceability of the firm\u2019s  \nright of setoff under netting and credit      \nsupport agreements, the firm evaluates various\nfactors, including applicable bankruptcy laws,\nlocal statutes and regulatory provisions in   \nthe jurisdiction of the parties to the        \nagreement.                                    \n                                           \n  9    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                           \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Derivatives are reported on a net-\nby-counterpartybasis (i.e., the net payable or\nreceivable for derivative assets and          \nliabilities for a given counterparty) in the  \nconsolidated balance sheets when a legal right\nof setoff exists under an enforceable netting \nagreement. Resale agreements and securities   \nsold under agreements to repurchase           \n(repurchase agreements) and securities        \nborrowed and loaned transactions with the same\nterm and currency are presented on a net-by-  \ncounterpartybasis in the consolidated balance \nsheets when such transactions meet certain    \nsettlement criteria and are subject to netting\nagreements. In the consolidated balance       \nsheets, derivatives are reported net of cash  \ncollateral received and posted under          \nenforceable credit support agreements, when   \ntransacted under an enforceable netting       \nagreement. In the consolidated balance sheets,\nresale and repurchase agreements, and         \nsecurities borrowed and loaned, are not       \nreported net of the related cash and          \nsecurities received or posted as collateral.  \nSee Note 11 for further information about     \ncollateral received and pledged, including    \nrights to deliver or repledge collateral. See \nNotes 7 and 11 for further information about  \noffsetting assets and liabilities. Share-Based\nCompensation The cost of employee services    \nreceived in exchange for a share-based award  \nis generally measured based on the grant-date \nfair value of the award. Share-based awards   \nthat do not require future service (i.e.,     \nvested awards, including awards granted to    \nretirement-eligible employees) are expensed   \nimmediately. Share-based awards that require  \nfuture service are amortized over the relevant\nservice period. Forfeitures are recorded when \nthey occur. Cash dividend equivalents paid on \nrestricted stock units (RSUs) are generally   \ncharged to retained earnings. If RSUs that    \nrequire future service are forfeited, the     \nrelated dividend equivalents originally       \ncharged to retained earnings are reclassified \nto compensation expense in the period in which\nforfeiture occurs. The firm generally issues  \nnew shares of common stock upon delivery of   \nshare-based awards. In certain cases,         \nprimarily related to conflicted employment (as\noutlined in the applicable award agreements), \nthe firm may cash settle share-based          \ncompensation awards accounted for as equity   \ninstruments. For these awards, whose terms    \nallow for cash settlement, additional paid-   \nincapital is adjusted to the extent of the    \ndifference between the value of the award at  \nthe time of cash settlement and the grant-date\nvalue of the award. The tax effect related to \nthe settlement of share-based awards is       \nrecorded in income tax benefit or expense.    \nForeign Currency Translation Assets and       \nliabilities denominated in non-U.S.currencies \nare translated at rates of exchange prevailing\non the date of the consolidated balance sheets\nand revenues and expenses are translated at   \naverage rates of exchange for the period.     \nForeign currency remeasurement gains or losses\non transactions in nonfunctional currencies   \nare recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on\ntranslation of the financial statements of a  \nnon-U.S.operation, when the functional        \ncurrency is other than the U.S. dollar, are   \nincluded, net of hedges and taxes, in the     \nconsolidated statements of comprehensive      \nincome. Recent Accounting Developments        \nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial     \nInstruments (ASC 326). In June 2016, the FASB \nissued ASU No. 2016-13,\u201cFinancial Instruments \n\u2014 Credit Losses (Topic 326) \u2014 Measurement of  \nCredit Losses on Financial Instruments.\u201d This \nASU amends several aspects of the measurement \nof credit losses on certain financial         \ninstruments, including replacing the existing \nincurred credit loss model and other models   \nwith the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL)\nmodel and amending certain aspects of         \naccounting for purchased financial assets with\ndeterioration in credit quality since         \norigination. The firm adopted this ASU in     \nJanuary 2020 under a modified retrospective   \napproach. As a result of adopting this ASU,   \nthe firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses on     \nfinancial assets and commitments that are     \nmeasured at amortized cost reflects           \nmanagement\u2019s estimate of credit losses over   \nthe remaining expected life of such assets.   \nExpected credit losses for newly recognized   \nfinancial assets and commitments, as well as  \nchanges to expected credit losses during the  \nperiod, are recognized in earnings. These     \nexpected credit losses are measured based on  \nhistorical experience, current conditions and \nforecasts that affect the collectability of   \nthe reported amount. The cumulative effect of \nmeasuring the allowance under CECL as a result\nof adopting this ASU as of January 1, 2020 was\nan increase in the allowance for credit losses\nof $ 848million. The increase in the allowance\nis driven by the fact that the allowance under\nCECL covers expected credit losses over the   \nfull expected life of the loan portfolios and \nalso takes into account forecasts of expected \nfuture economic conditions. In addition, in   \naccordance with the ASU, the firm elected the \nfair value option for loans that were         \npreviously accounted for as Purchased Credit  \nImpaired (PCI), which resulted in a decrease  \nto the allowance for PCI loans of $           \n169million. The cumulative effect of adopting \nthis ASU was a decrease to retained earnings  \nof $ 638million (net of tax).                 \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    10  \n                                            \n              Table of Contents               \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU \nNo. 2020-04,\u201cReference Rate Reform \u2014          \nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate \nReform on Financial Reporting.\u201d This ASU      \nprovides optional relief from applying        \ngenerally accepted accounting principles to   \ncontracts, hedging relationships and other    \ntransactions affected by reference rate       \nreform. In addition, in January 2021 the FASB \nissued ASU No. 2021-01\u201cReference Rate Reform \u2014\nScope,\u201d which clarified the scope of ASC 848  \nrelating to contract modifications. The firm  \nadopted these ASUs upon issuance and elected  \nto apply the relief available to certain      \nmodified derivatives. The adoption of these   \nASUs did not have a material impact on the    \nfirm\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Note\n4. Fair Value Measurements The fair value of a\nfinancial instrument is the amount that would \nbe received to sell an asset or paid to       \ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Financial assets are marked to bid      \nprices and financial liabilities are marked to\noffer prices. Fair value measurements do not  \ninclude transaction costs. The firm measures  \ncertain financial assets and liabilities as a \nportfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to \nmarket and/or credit risks). The best evidence\nof fair value is a quoted price in an active  \nmarket. If quoted prices in active markets are\nnot available, fair value is determined by    \nreference to prices for similar instruments,  \nquoted prices or recent transactions in less  \nactive markets, or internally developed models\nthat primarily use market-based or            \nindependently sourced inputs, including, but  \nnot limited to, interest rates, volatilities, \nequity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates,\ncommodity prices, credit spreads and funding  \nspreads (i.e., the spread or difference       \nbetween the interest rate at which a borrower \ncould finance a given financial instrument    \nrelative to a benchmark interest rate). U.S.  \nGAAP has a three-level hierarchy for          \ndisclosure of fair value measurements. This   \nhierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation \ntechniques used to measure fair value, giving \nthe highest priority to level 1 inputs and the\nlowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial\ninstrument\u2019s level in this hierarchy is based \non the lowest level of input that is          \nsignificant to its fair value measurement. In \nevaluating the significance of a valuation    \ninput, the firm considers, among other        \nfactors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to   \nthat input. The fair value hierarchy is as    \nfollows: Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted\nprices in active markets to which the firm had\naccess at the measurement date for identical, \nunrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2.  \nInputs to valuation techniques are observable,\neither directly or indirectly. Level 3. One or\nmore inputs to valuation techniques are       \nsignificant and unobservable. The fair values \nfor substantially all of the firm\u2019s financial \nassets and liabilities are based on observable\nprices and inputs and are classified in levels\n1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain  \nlevel 2 and level 3 financial assets and      \nliabilities may require valuation adjustments \nthat a market participant would require to    \narrive at fair value for factors, such as     \ncounterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality,   \nfunding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity\nand bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments  \nare generally based on market evidence.       \n                                            \n  11    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

See Notes 5  \nthrough 10 for further information about      \nsignificant unobservable inputs used to value \nlevel 3 financial instruments. Valuation      \nTechniques and Significant Inputs for Trading \nCash Instruments, Investments and Loans Level \n1. Level 1 instruments include U.S. government\nobligations, most non-U.S.government          \nobligations, certain agency obligations,      \ncertain corporate debt instruments, certain   \nmoney market instruments and actively traded  \nlisted equities. These instruments are valued \nusing quoted prices for identical unrestricted\ninstruments in active markets. The firm       \ndefines active markets for equity instruments \nbased on the average daily trading volume both\nin absolute terms and relative to the market  \ncapitalization for the instrument. The firm   \ndefines active markets for debt instruments   \nbased on both the average daily trading volume\nand the number of days with trading activity. \nLevel 2. Level 2 instruments include certain  \nnon-U.S.government obligations, most agency   \nobligations, most mortgage-backed loans and   \nsecurities, most corporate debt instruments,  \nmost state and municipal obligations, most    \nmoney market instruments, most other debt     \nobligations, restricted or less liquid listed \nequities, certain private equities,           \ncommodities and certain lending commitments.  \nValuations of level 2 instruments can be      \nverified to quoted prices, recent trading     \nactivity for identical or similar instruments,\nbroker or dealer quotations or alternative    \npricing sources with reasonable levels of     \nprice transparency. Consideration is given to \nthe nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative\nor firm) and the relationship of recent market\nactivity to the prices provided from          \nalternative pricing sources. Valuation        \nadjustments are typically made to level 2     \ninstruments (i) if the instrument is subject  \nto transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other\npremiums and liquidity discounts that a market\nparticipant would require to arrive at fair   \nvalue. Valuation adjustments are generally    \nbased on market evidence. Level 3. Level 3    \ninstruments have one or more significant      \nvaluation inputs that are not observable.     \nAbsent evidence to the contrary, level 3      \ninstruments are initially valued at           \ntransaction price, which is considered to be  \nthe best initial estimate of fair value.      \nSubsequently, the firm uses other             \nmethodologies to determine fair value, which  \nvary based on the type of instrument.         \nValuation inputs and assumptions are changed  \nwhen corroborated by substantive observable   \nevidence, including values realized on sales. \nValuation techniques of\nlevel 3 instruments\nvary by instrument, but\nare generally based on\ndiscounted cash flow\ntechniques.

Interest    \n       rate swaps and options denominated in  \n       the currencies of leading              \n       industrialized nations are             \n  \u2022    characterized by high trading volumes  \n       and tight bid/offer spreads.

Credit default   \n       swaps that reference indices, large    \n       corporates and major sovereigns        \n       generally exhibit the most price       \n       transparency. For credit default       \n       swaps with other underliers, price     \n       transparency varies based on credit    \n       rating, the cost of borrowing the      \n       underlying reference obligations, and  \n  \u2022    the availability of the underlying     \n       reference obligations for delivery     \n       upon the default of the issuer.        \n       Credit default swaps that reference    \n       loans, asset-backed securities and     \n       emerging market debt instruments tend  \n       to have less price transparency than   \n       those that reference corporate bonds.  \n       In addition, more complex credit       \n       derivatives, such as those sensitive   \n       to the correlation between two or      \n       more underlying reference              \n       obligations, generally have less       \n       price transparency.                    \n                                              \n                                            \n  13    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Price transparency      \n       varies based on the underlying         \n  \u2022    commodity, delivery location, tenor    \n       and product quality (e.g., diesel      \n       fuel compared to unleaded gasoline).   \n       In general, price transparency for     \n       commodity derivatives is greater for   \n       contracts with shorter tenors and      \n       contracts that are more closely        \n       aligned with major and/or benchmark    \n       commodity indices.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Equity.Price transparency for equity   \n       derivatives varies by market and       \n       underlier. Options on indices and the  \n       common stock of corporates included    \n       in major equity indices exhibit the    \n       most price transparency.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Subsequent to the initial         \nvaluation of a level 3 derivative, the firm   \nupdates the level 1 and level 2 inputs to     \nreflect observable market changes and any     \nresulting gains and losses are classified in  \nlevel 3. Level 3 inputs are changed when      \ncorroborated by evidence, such as similar     \nmarket transactions, third-party pricing      \nservices and/or broker or dealer quotations or\nother empirical market data. In circumstances \nwhere the firm cannot verify the model value  \nby reference to market transactions, it is    \npossible that a different valuation model     \ncould produce a materially different estimate \nof fair value. See Note 7 for further         \ninformation about significant unobservable    \ninputs used in the valuation of level 3       \nderivatives. Valuation Adjustments. Valuation \nadjustments are integral to determining the   \nfair value of derivative portfolios and are   \nused to adjust the mid-marketvaluations       \nproduced by derivative pricing models to the  \nexit price valuation. These adjustments       \nincorporate bid/offer spreads, the cost of    \nliquidity, credit valuation adjustments and   \nfunding valuation adjustments, which account  \nfor the credit and funding risk inherent in   \nthe uncollateralized portion of derivative    \nportfolios. The firm also makes funding       \nvaluation adjustments to collateralized       \nderivatives where the terms of the agreement  \ndo not permit the firm to deliver or repledge \ncollateral received. Market-based inputs are  \ngenerally used when calibrating valuation     \nadjustments to market-clearing levels. In     \naddition, for derivatives that include        \nsignificant unobservable inputs, the firm     \nmakes model or exit price adjustments to      \naccount for the valuation uncertainty present \nin the transaction. Valuation Techniques and  \nSignificant Inputs for Other Financial        \nInstruments at Fair Value In addition to      \ntrading cash instruments, derivatives, and    \ncertain investments and loans, the firm       \naccounts for certain of its other financial   \nassets and liabilities at fair value under the\nfair value option. Such instruments include   \nrepurchase agreements and substantially all   \nresale agreements; securities borrowed and    \nloaned in Fixed Income, Currency and          \nCommodities (FICC) financing; certain customer\nand other receivables, including certain      \nmargin loans; certain time deposits, including\nstructured certificates of deposit, which are \nhybrid financial instruments; substantially   \nall other secured financings, including       \ntransfers of assets accounted for as          \nfinancings; certain unsecured short- and long-\nterm borrowings, substantially all of which   \nare hybrid financial instruments; and other   \nliabilities. These instruments are generally  \nvalued based on discounted cash flow          \ntechniques, which incorporate inputs with     \nreasonable levels of price transparency, and  \nare generally classified in level 2 because   \nthe inputs are observable.

Accordingly, gains or losses    \n       in one product type frequently offset  \n       gains or losses in other product       \n  \u2022    types. For example, most of the        \n       firm\u2019s longer-term derivatives across  \n       product types are sensitive to         \n       changes in interest rates and may be   \n       economically hedged with interest      \n       rate swaps. Similarly, a significant   \n       portion of the firm\u2019s trading cash     \n       instruments and derivatives across     \n       product types has exposure to foreign  \n       currencies and may be economically     \n       hedged with foreign currency           \n       contracts.                             \n                                              \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    16  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

For example,  \n       the highest recovery rate for          \n       corporate debt instruments is          \n  \u2022    appropriate for valuing a specific     \n       corporate debt instrument, but may     \n       not be appropriate for valuing any     \n       other corporate debt instrument.       \n       Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do   \n       not represent uncertainty in, or       \n       possible ranges of, fair value         \n       measurements of level\u00a03 trading cash   \n       instruments.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Increases in yield, duration or        \n       cumulative loss rate used in the       \n       valuation of level\u00a03 trading cash      \n       instruments would have resulted in a   \n       lower fair value measurement, while    \n       increases in recovery rate would have  \n  \u2022    resulted in a higher fair value        \n       measurement as of both March\u00a02021 and  \n       December\u00a02020. Due to the distinctive  \n       nature of each level\u00a03 trading cash    \n       instrument, the interrelationship of   \n       inputs is not necessarily uniform      \n       within each product type.              \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Trading cash instruments are valued    \n       using discounted cash flows.           \n                                              \nLevel 3 Rollforward                           \nThe table below\npresents a summary of\nthe changes in fair\nvalue for level 3\ntrading cash\ninstruments.\n                                              \n                      Three                   \n                     Months                   \n                Ended March                   \n  $ in\u00a0                2021          2020     \n  millions                                    \n  Total                                       \n  trading                                     \n  cash                                        \n  instrument                                  \n  assets                                      \n  Beginning          $1,237        $1,242     \n  balance                                     \n  Net                                         \n  realized               33            34     \n  gains/(lo\u2026                                  \n  Net                                         \n  unrealized             33          (159  )  \n  gains/(lo\u2026                                  \n  Purchases             521           353     \n  Sales                (307  )       (268  )  \n  Settlemen\u2026           (153  )       (153  )  \n  Transfers                                   \n  into level            224           342     \n  3                                           \n  Transfers                                   \n  out of               (215  )       (157  )  \n  level\u00a03                                     \n  Ending             $1,373        $1,234     \n  balance                                     \n  Total                                       \n  trading                                     \n  cash                                        \n  instrument                                  \n  liabiliti\u2026                                  \n  Beginning            $(80  )    $\u00a0\u00a0(273  )  \n  balance                                     \n  Net                                         \n  realized                1             \u2013     \n  gains/(lo\u2026                                  \n  Net                                         \n  unrealized             (2  )         91     \n  gains/(lo\u2026                                  \n  Purchases              21            26     \n  Sales                 (40  )        (32  )  \n  Settlemen\u2026              7            (2  )  \n  Transfers                                   \n  into level            (19  )        (13  )  \n  3                                           \n  Transfers                                   \n  out of                  6             9     \n  level\u00a03                                     \n  Ending              $(106  )    $\u00a0\u00a0(194  )  \n  balance                                     \n                                              \nIn the table above:\n                                              \n       Changes in fair value are presented    \n  \u2022    for all trading cash instruments that  \n       are classified in level\u00a03 as of the    \n       end of the period.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates  \n  \u2022    to trading cash instruments that were  \n       still held atperiod-end.               \n                                              \n                                              \n       Transfers between levels of the fair   \n       value hierarchy are reported at the    \n       beginning of the reporting period in   \n  \u2022    which they occur.

The net\nrealized and\nunrealized gains on\nlevel 3 trading cash\ninstrument assets of $\n66million (reflecting\n$ 33million of net\nrealized gains and $\n33million of net\nunrealized gains) for\nthe three months ended\nMarch 2021 included\ngains of $ 28million\nreported in market\nmaking and $ 38million\nreported in interest\nincome.\n\nThe drivers of the net\nunrealized gains on\nlevel 3 trading cash\ninstrument assets for\nthe three months ended\nMarch 2021 were not\nmaterial.\nTransfers into level 3 trading cash instrument\nassets during the three months ended March    \n2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain \nloans and securities backed by residential    \nreal estate and corporate debt instruments    \nfrom level 2 (in each case, principally due to\nreduced price transparency as a result of a   \nlack of market evidence, including fewer      \nmarket transactions in these instruments).    \nTransfers out of level 3 trading cash         \ninstrument assets during the three months     \nended March 2021 primarily reflected transfers\nof certain corporate debt instruments and     \nloans and securities backed by commercial real\nestate to level 2 (in each case, principally  \ndue to increased price transparency as a      \nresult of market evidence, including market   \ntransactions in these instruments). Three     \nMonths Ended March 2020. The net realized and \nunrealized losses on level 3 trading cash     \ninstrument assets of $ 125million (reflecting \n$ 34million of net realized gains and $       \n159million of net unrealized losses) for the  \nthree months ended March 2020 included        \ngains/(losses) of $( 4) million reported in   \ninvestment banking, $( 158) million reported  \nin market making and $ 37million reported in  \ninterest income. The net unrealized losses on \nlevel 3 trading cash instrument assets for the\nthree months ended March 2020 primarily       \nreflected losses on certain corporate debt    \ninstruments, principally driven by weak       \ncorporate performance. Transfers into level 3 \ntrading cash instrument assets during the     \nthree months ended March 2020 primarily       \nreflected transfers of certain corporate debt \ninstruments from level 2 (principally due to  \nreduced price transparency as a result of a   \nlack of market evidence, including fewer      \nmarket transactions in these instruments). The\ndrivers of transfers out of level 3 trading   \ncash instrument assets during the three months\nended March 2020 were not material. Note 7.   \nDerivatives and Hedging Activities Derivative \nActivities Derivatives are instruments that   \nderive their value from underlying asset      \nprices, indices, reference rates and other    \ninputs, or a combination of these factors.    \nDerivatives may be traded on an exchange      \n(exchange-traded) or they may be privately    \nnegotiated contracts, which are usually       \nreferred to as OTC derivatives. Certain of the\nfirm\u2019s OTC derivatives are cleared and settled\nthrough central clearing counterparties (OTC- \ncleared),while others are bilateral contracts \nbetween two counterparties (bilateral OTC).   \n                                            \n  19    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

As a\nmarket maker, the firm\nenters into derivative\ntransactions to\nprovide liquidity to\nclients and to\nfacilitate the\ntransfer and hedging\nof their risks. In\nthis role, the firm\ntypically acts as\nprincipal and is\nrequired to commit\ncapital to provide\nexecution, and\nmaintains market-\nmaking positions in\nresponse to, or in\nanticipation of,\nclient demand.\n\nRisk Management. The\nfirm also enters into\nderivatives to\nactively manage risk\nexposures that arise\nfrom its market-making\nand investing and\nfinancing activities.\nThe firm\u2019s holdings\nand exposures are\nhedged, in many cases,\non either a portfolio\nor risk-specific\nbasis, as opposed to\nan instrument-by-\ninstrumentbasis. The\noffsetting impact of\nthis economic hedging\nis reflected in the\nsame business segment\nas the related\nrevenues. In addition,\nthe firm may enter\ninto derivatives\ndesignated as hedges\nunder U.S. GAAP. These\nderivatives are used\nto manage interest\nrate exposure of\ncertain fixed-rate\nunsecured borrowings\nand deposits, as well\nas to manage foreign\nexchange risk of\ncertain available-for-\nsalesecurities and the\nnet investment in\ncertain\nnon-U.S.operations.\n\nThe firm enters into\nvarious types of\nderivatives,\nincluding:\n                                              \n       Futures and Forwards.Contracts that    \n       commit counterparties to purchase or   \n  \u2022    sell financial instruments,            \n       commodities or currencies in the       \n       future.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Swaps.Contracts that require           \n       counterparties to exchange cash        \n       flows, such as currency or interest    \n       payment streams. The amounts           \n  \u2022    exchanged are based on the specific    \n       terms of the contract with reference   \n       to specified rates, financial          \n       instruments, commodities, currencies   \n       or indices.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Options.Contracts in which the option  \n       purchaser has the right, but not the   \n       obligation, to purchase from or sell   \n  \u2022    to the option writer financial         \n       instruments, commodities or            \n       currencies within a defined time       \n       period for a specified price.          \n                                              \nDerivatives are\nreported on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis\n(i.e., the net payable\nor receivable for\nderivative assets and\nliabilities for a\ngiven counterparty)\nwhen a legal right of\nsetoff exists under an\nenforceable netting\nagreement\n(counterparty\nnetting).

An average      \n       greater than the median indicates      \n  \u2022    that the majority of inputs are below  \n       the average. For example, the          \n       difference between the average and     \n       the median for credit spreads          \n       indicates that the majority of the     \n       inputs fall in the lower end of the    \n       range.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       The ranges, averages and medians of    \n       these inputs are not representative    \n       of the appropriate inputs to use when  \n       calculating the fair value of any one  \n       derivative. For example, the highest   \n       correlation for interest rate          \n       derivatives is appropriate for         \n  \u2022    valuing a specific interest rate       \n       derivative but may not be appropriate  \n       for valuing any other interest rate    \n       derivative. Accordingly, the ranges    \n       of inputs do not represent             \n       uncertainty in, or possible ranges     \n       of, fair value measurements of level\u00a0  \n       3 derivatives.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Interest rates, currencies and         \n       equities derivatives are valued using  \n       option pricing models, credit          \n       derivatives are valued using option    \n  \u2022    pricing, correlation and discounted    \n       cash flow models, and commodities      \n       derivatives are valued using option    \n       pricing and discounted cash flow       \n       models.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       The fair value of any one instrument   \n       may be determined using multiple       \n       valuation techniques. For example,     \n  \u2022    option pricing models and discounted   \n       cash flows models are typically used   \n       together to determine fair value.      \n       Therefore, the level\u00a03 balance         \n       encompasses both of these techniques.  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Correlation within currencies and      \n  \u2022    equities includes cross-product type   \n       correlation.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Natural gas spread represents the      \n  \u2022    spread per\u00a0million British thermal     \n       units of natural gas.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Oil spread represents the spread per   \n       barrel of oil and refined products.    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Electricitypricerepresents             \n  \u2022    thepriceper megawatt hour of           \n       electricity.                           \n                                              \nRange of Significant                          \nUnobservable Inputs                           \nThe following provides\ninformation about the\nranges of significant\nunobservable inputs\nused to value the\nfirm\u2019s level 3\nderivative instruments:\n                                              \n       Correlation.Ranges for correlation     \n       cover a variety of underliers both     \n       within one product type (e.g., equity  \n       index and equity single stock names)   \n       and across product types (e.g.,        \n       correlation of an interest rate and a  \n  \u2022    currency), as well as across regions.  \n       Generally, cross-product type          \n       correlation inputs are used to value   \n       more complex instruments and are       \n       lower than correlation inputs on       \n       assets within the same derivative      \n       product type.                          \n                                              \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    22  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The net unrealized gains on     \nlevel 3 derivatives for the three months ended\nMarch 2020 were primarily attributable to     \ngains on certain equity derivatives (primarily\nreflecting the impact of a decrease in equity \nprices), gains on certain credit derivatives  \n(primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease\nin interest rates and widening of certain     \ncredit spreads), gains on certain commodity   \nderivatives (primarily reflecting the impact  \nof a decrease in commodity prices), gains on  \ncertain currency derivatives (primarily       \nreflecting the impact of changes in foreign   \nexchange rates) and gains on certain interest \nrate derivatives (primarily reflecting a      \ndecrease in interest rates).

Credit\nderivatives are\nactively managed based\non the firm\u2019s net risk\nposition. Credit\nderivatives are\ngenerally individually\nnegotiated contracts\nand can have various\nsettlement and payment\nconventions. Credit\nevents include failure\nto pay, bankruptcy,\nacceleration of\nindebtedness,\nrestructuring,\nrepudiation and\ndissolution of the\nreference entity.\n\nThe firm enters into\nthe following types of\ncredit derivatives:\n                                              \n       Credit Default Swaps.Single-name       \n       credit default swaps protect the       \n       buyer against the loss of principal    \n       on one or more bonds, loans or         \n       mortgages (reference obligations) in   \n       the event the issuer of the reference  \n       obligations suffers a credit event.    \n       The buyer of protection pays an        \n       initial or periodic premium to the     \n  \u2022    seller and receives protection for     \n       the period of the contract. If there   \n       is no credit event, as defined in the  \n       contract, the seller of protection     \n       makes no payments to the buyer. If a   \n       credit event occurs, the seller of     \n       protection is required to make a       \n       payment to the buyer, calculated       \n       according to the terms of the          \n       contract.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Credit Options.In a credit option,     \n       the option writer assumes the          \n       obligation to purchase or sell a       \n       reference obligation at a specified    \n       price or credit spread. The option     \n       purchaser buys the right, but does     \n  \u2022    not assume the obligation, to sell     \n       the reference obligation to, or        \n       purchase it from, the option writer.   \n       The payments on credit options depend  \n       either on a particular credit spread   \n       or the price of the reference          \n       obligation.                            \n                                              \n                                            \n  25    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited)                                   \n                                              \n       Credit Indices, Baskets and            \n       Tranches.Credit derivatives may        \n       reference a basket of single-name      \n       credit default swaps or a broad-based  \n       index. If a credit event occurs in     \n       one of the underlying reference        \n       obligations, the protection seller     \n       pays the protection buyer. The         \n       payment is typically apro-rataportion  \n       of the transaction\u2019s total notional    \n  \u2022    amount based on the underlying         \n       defaulted reference obligation. In     \n       certain transactions, the credit risk  \n       of a basket or index is separated      \n       into various portions (tranches),      \n       each having different levels of        \n       subordination. The most junior         \n       tranches cover initial defaults and    \n       once losses exceed the notional        \n       amount of these junior tranches, any   \n       excess loss is covered by the next     \n       most senior tranche.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Total Return Swaps.A total return      \n       swap transfers the risks relating to   \n       economic performance of a reference    \n       obligation from the protection buyer   \n       to the protection seller. Typically,   \n       the protection buyer receives a        \n  \u2022    floating rate of interest and          \n       protection against any reduction in    \n       fair value of the reference            \n       obligation, and the protection seller  \n       receives the cash flows associated     \n       with the reference obligation, plus    \n       any increase in the fair value of the  \n       reference obligation.                  \n                                              \nThe firm economically\nhedges its exposure to\nwritten credit\nderivatives primarily\nby entering into\noffsetting purchased\ncredit derivatives\nwith identical\nunderliers.\nSubstantially all of\nthe firm\u2019s purchased\ncredit derivative\ntransactions are with\nfinancial institutions\nand are subject to\nstringent collateral\nthresholds. In\naddition, upon the\noccurrence of a\nspecified trigger\nevent, the firm may\ntake possession of the\nreference obligations\nunderlying a\nparticular written\ncredit derivative, and\nconsequently may, upon\nliquidation of the\nreference obligations,\nrecover amounts on the\nunderlying reference\nobligations in the\nevent of default.\n\nAs of March 2021,\nwritten credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n598.82billion and\npurchased credit\nderivatives had a\ntotal gross notional\namount of $\n638.50billion, for\ntotal net notional\npurchased protection\nof $ 39.68billion.

These interest\nrate swaps hedge\nchanges in fair value\nattributable to the\ndesignated benchmark\ninterest rate (e.g.,\nLondon Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR),\nSecured Overnight\nFinancing Rate or\nOvernight Index Swap\nRate), effectively\nconverting a\nsubstantial portion of\nfixed-rate obligations\ninto floating-rate\nobligations.\nThe firm applies a\nstatistical method that\nutilizes regression\nanalysis when assessing\nthe effectiveness of\nthese hedging\nrelationships in\nachieving offsetting\nchanges in the fair\nvalues of the hedging\ninstrument and the risk\nbeing hedged (i.e.,\ninterest rate risk). An\ninterest rate swap is\nconsidered highly\neffective in offsetting\nchanges in fair value\nattributable to changes\nin the hedged risk when\nthe regression analysis\nresults in a\ncoefficient of\ndetermination of 80% or\ngreater and a slope\nbetween 80% and 125%.\n                                            \n  27    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Investments in Funds at Net Asset \nValue Per Share. Equity securities and debt   \ninstruments, at fair value include investments\nin funds that are measured at NAV of the      \ninvestment fund. The firm uses NAV to measure \nthe fair value of fund investments when (i)   \nthe fund investment does not have a readily   \ndeterminable fair value and (ii) the NAV of   \nthe investment fund is calculated in a manner \nconsistent with the measurement principles of \ninvestment company accounting, including      \nmeasurement of the investments at fair value. \nSubstantially all of the firm\u2019s investments in\nfunds at NAV consist of investments in firm-  \nsponsored private equity, credit, real estate \nand hedge funds where the firm co-investswith \nthird-party investors. Private equity funds   \nprimarily invest in a broad range of          \nindustries worldwide, including leveraged     \nbuyouts, recapitalizations, growth investments\nand distressed investments. Credit funds      \ngenerally invest in loans and other fixed     \nincome instruments and are focused on         \nproviding private high-yield capital for      \nleveraged and management buyout transactions, \nrecapitalizations, financings, refinancings,  \nacquisitions and restructurings for private   \nequity firms, private family companies and    \ncorporate issuers. Real estate funds invest   \nglobally, primarily in real estate companies, \nloan portfolios, debt recapitalizations and   \nproperty. Private equity, credit and real     \nestate funds are closed-endfunds in which the \nfirm\u2019s investments are generally not eligible \nfor redemption. Distributions will be received\nfrom these funds as the underlying assets are \nliquidated or distributed, the timing of which\nis uncertain. The firm also invests in hedge  \nfunds, primarily multi-disciplinary hedge     \nfunds that employ a fundamental bottom-       \nupinvestment approach across various asset    \nclasses and strategies. The firm\u2019s investments\nin hedge funds primarily include interests    \nwhere the underlying assets are illiquid in   \nnature, and proceeds from redemptions will not\nbe received until the underlying assets are   \nliquidated or distributed, the timing of which\nis uncertain. Private equity, hedge and real  \nestate funds described above are primarily    \n\u201ccovered funds\u201d as defined in the Volcker Rule\nof the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).

A loan is\nconsidered past due\nwhen a principal or\ninterest payment has\nnot been made according\nto its contractual\nterms. Credit card\nloans are not placed on\nnonaccrual status and\naccrue interest until\nthe loan is paid in\nfull or is charged-off.\n\nIn certain\ncircumstances, the firm\nmay modify the original\nterms of a loan\nagreement by granting a\nconcession to a\nborrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty,\ntypically in the form\nof a modification of\nloan covenants, but may\nalso include\nforbearance of interest\nor principal, payment\nextensions or interest\nrate reductions.

To determine the \nallowance for credit losses, the firm         \nclassifies its loans and lending commitments  \naccounted for at amortized cost into wholesale\nand consumer portfolios. These portfolios     \nrepresent the level at which the firm has     \ndeveloped and documented its methodology to   \ndetermine the allowance for credit losses. The\nallowance for credit losses is measured on a  \ncollective basis for loans that exhibit       \nsimilar risk characteristics using a modeled  \napproach and asset-specific basis for loans   \nthat do not share similar risk                \ncharacteristics. The allowance for credit     \nlosses takes into account the weighted average\nof a range of forecasts of future economic    \nconditions over the expected life of the loan \nand lending commitments. The expected life of \neach loan or lending commitment is determined \nbased on the contractual term adjusted for    \nextension options or demand features. The     \nforecasts include baseline, favorable and     \nadverse economic scenarios over a three-year  \nperiod. For loans with expected lives beyond  \nthree years, the model reverts to historical  \nloss information based on a non-linearmodeled \napproach. The forecasted economic scenarios   \nconsider a number of risk factors relevant to \nthe wholesale and consumer portfolios         \ndescribed below. The firm applies judgment in \nweighing individual scenarios each quarter    \nbased on a variety of factors, including the  \nfirm\u2019s internally derived economic outlook,   \nmarket consensus, recent macroeconomic        \nconditions and industry trends.

The allowance   \nfor credit losses for wholesale loans and     \nlending commitments that exhibit similar risk \ncharacteristics is measured using a modeled   \napproach. These models determine the          \nprobability of default and loss given default \nbased on various risk factors, including      \ninternal credit ratings, industry default and \nloss data, expected life, macroeconomic       \nindicators, the borrower\u2019s capacity to meet   \nits financial obligations, the borrower\u2019s     \ncountry of risk and industry, loan seniority  \nand collateral type. For lending commitments, \nthe methodology also considers probability of \ndrawdowns or funding. In addition, for loans  \nbacked by real estate, risk factors include   \nthe loan-to-valueratio, debt service ratio and\nhome price index. The most significant inputs \nto the forecast model for wholesale loans and \nlending commitments include unemployment      \nrates, GDP, credit spreads, commercial and    \nindustrial delinquency rates, short- and long-\nterm interest rates, and oil prices. The      \nallowance for loan losses for wholesale loans \nthat do not share similar risk                \ncharacteristics, such as nonaccrual loans or  \nloans in a troubled debt restructuring, is    \ncalculated using the present value of expected\nfuture cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s    \noriginal effective rate, the observable market\nprice of the loan or the fair value of the    \ncollateral. Wholesale loans are charged-      \noffagainst the allowance for loan losses when \ndeemed to be uncollectible. Consumer. The     \nallowance for credit losses for consumer loans\nthat exhibit similar risk characteristics is  \ncalculated using a modeled approach which     \nclassifies consumer loans into pools based on \nborrower-related and exposure-related         \ncharacteristics that differentiate a pool\u2019s   \nrisk characteristics from other pools. The    \nfactors considered in determining a pool are  \ngenerally consistent with the risk            \ncharacteristics used for internal credit risk \nmeasurement and management and include key    \nmetrics, such as FICO credit scores,          \ndelinquency status, loan vintage and          \nmacroeconomic indicators. The most significant\ninputs to the forecast model for consumer     \nloans include unemployment rates and          \ndelinquency rates. The expected life of       \nrevolving credit card loans is determined by  \nmodeling expected future draws and the timing \nand amount of repayments allocated to the     \nfunded balance. The firm also recognizes an   \nallowance for credit losses on commitments to \nacquire loans; however, no allowance for      \ncredit losses is recognized on credit card    \nlending commitments as they are cancellable by\nthe firm.                                     \n                                            \n  39    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm\ngenerally calculates\nthe fair value of\nloans and lending\ncommitments for which\nthe fair value option\nis elected by\ndiscounting future\ncash flows at a rate\nwhich incorporates the\ninstrument-specific\ncredit spreads. For\nfloating-rate loans\nand lending\ncommitments,\nsubstantially all\nchanges in fair value\nare attributable to\nchanges in instrument-\nspecific credit\nspreads, whereas for\nfixed-rate loans and\nlending commitments,\nchanges in fair value\nare also attributable\nto changes in interest\nrates.\nNote 11. Collateralized Agreements and        \nFinancings Collateralized agreements are      \nresale agreements and securities borrowed.    \nCollateralized financings are repurchase      \nagreements, securities loaned and other       \nsecured financings. The firm enters into these\ntransactions in order to, among other things, \nfacilitate client activities, invest excess   \ncash, acquire securities to cover short       \npositions and finance certain firm activities.\nCollateralized agreements and financings are  \npresented on a net-by-counterpartybasis when a\nlegal right of setoff exists. Interest on     \ncollateralized agreements, which is included  \nin interest income, and collateralized        \nfinancings, which is included in interest     \nexpense, is recognized over the life of the   \ntransaction.See Note 23 for further           \ninformation about interest income and interest\nexpense. Resale and Repurchase Agreements A   \nresale agreement is a transaction in which the\nfirm purchases financial instruments from a   \nseller, typically in exchange for cash, and   \nsimultaneously enters into an agreement to    \nresell the same or substantially the same     \nfinancial instruments to the seller at a      \nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. A repurchase agreement is a transaction \nin which the firm sells financial instruments \nto a buyer, typically in exchange for cash,   \nand simultaneously enters into an agreement to\nrepurchase the same or substantially the same \nfinancial instruments from the buyer at a     \nstated price plus accrued interest at a future\ndate. Even though repurchase and resale       \nagreements (including \u201crepos- and reverses-to-\nmaturity\u201d)involve the legal transfer of       \nownership of financial instruments, they are  \naccounted for as financing arrangements       \nbecause they require the financial instruments\nto be repurchased or resold before or at the  \nmaturity of the agreement. The financial      \ninstruments purchased or sold in resale and   \nrepurchase agreements typically include U.S.  \ngovernment and agency, and investment-grade   \nsovereign obligations. The firm receives      \nfinancial instruments purchased under resale  \nagreements and makes delivery of financial    \ninstruments sold under repurchase agreements. \nTo mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors\nthe market value of these financial           \ninstruments on a daily basis, and delivers or \nobtains additional collateral due to changes  \nin the market value of the financial          \ninstruments, as appropriate. For resale       \nagreements, the firm typically requires       \ncollateral with a fair value approximately    \nequal to the carrying value of the relevant   \nassets in the consolidated balance sheets.    \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    48  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

When assessing\ngoodwill for\nimpairment, first, a\nqualitative assessment\ncan be made to\ndetermine whether it\nis more likely than\nnot that the estimated\nfair value of a\nreporting unit is less\nthan its estimated\ncarrying value. If the\nresults of the\nqualitative assessment\nare not conclusive, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest is performed.\nAlternatively, a\nquantitative goodwill\ntest can be performed\nwithout performing a\nqualitative\nassessment.\n\nThe quantitative\ngoodwill test compares\nthe estimated fair\nvalue of each\nreporting unit with\nits estimated net book\nvalue (including\ngoodwill and\nidentifiable\nintangible assets). If\nthe reporting unit\u2019s\nestimated fair value\nexceeds its estimated\nnet book value,\ngoodwill is not\nimpaired. An\nimpairment is\nrecognized if the\nestimated fair value\nof a reporting unit is\nless than its\nestimated net book\nvalue.\nTo estimate the fair value of each reporting  \nunit, other than Consumer banking, a relative \nvalue technique is used because the firm      \nbelieves market participants would use this   \ntechnique to value these reporting units. The \nrelative value technique applies observable   \nprice-to-earningsmultiples or price-to-       \nbookmultiples of comparable competitors to    \nreporting units\u2019 net earnings or net book     \nvalue. To estimate the fair value of Consumer \nbanking, a discounted cash flow valuation     \napproach is used because the firm believes    \nmarket participants would use this technique  \nto value that reporting unit given its early  \nstage of development. The estimated net       \ncarrying value of each reporting unit reflects\nan allocation of total shareholders\u2019 equity   \nand represents the estimated amount of total  \nshareholders\u2019 equity required to support the  \nactivities of the reporting unit under        \ncurrently applicable regulatory capital       \nrequirements. In the fourth quarter of 2020,  \nthe firm performed its annual assessment of   \ngoodwill for impairment, for each of its      \nreporting units, by performing a qualitative  \nassessment. Multiple factors, including       \nperformance indicators, macroeconomic         \nindicators, firm and industry events, and fair\nvalue indicators, were assessed with respect  \nto each of the firm\u2019s reporting units to      \ndetermine whether it was more likely than not \nthat the estimated fair value of any of these \nreporting units was less than its estimated   \ncarrying value. The qualitative assessment    \nalso considered changes since the quantitative\ntest performed in the fourth quarter of 2019. \nAs a result of the qualitative assessment, the\nfirm determined that it was more likely than  \nnot that the estimated fair value of each of  \nthe reporting units exceeded its respective   \nestimated carrying value. Therefore, the firm \ndetermined that goodwill for each reporting   \nunit was not impaired and that a quantitative \ngoodwill test was not required. There were no \nevents or changes in circumstances during the \nthree months ended March 2021 that would      \nindicate that it was more likely than not that\nthe estimated fair value of each of the       \nreporting units did not exceed its respective \nestimated carrying value as of March 2021.    \n                                            \n  53    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

To the extent the carrying value \nof an asset or asset group exceeds the        \nprojected undiscounted cash flows expected to \nresult from the use and eventual disposal of  \nthe asset or asset group, the firm determines \nthe asset or asset group is impaired and      \nrecords an impairment equal to the difference \nbetween the estimated fair value and the      \ncarrying value of the asset or asset group. In\naddition, the firm will recognize an          \nimpairment prior to the sale of an asset or   \nasset group if the carrying value of the asset\nor asset group exceeds its estimated fair     \nvalue. There were no material impairments     \nduring either the three months ended March    \n2021 or March 2020. Operating Lease Right-of- \nUseAssets The firm enters into operating      \nleases for real estate, office equipment and  \nother assets, substantially all of which are  \nused in connection with its operations. For   \nleases longer than one year, the firm         \nrecognizes a right-of-useasset representing   \nthe right to use the underlying asset for the \nlease term, and a lease liability representing\nthe liability to make payments. The lease term\nis generally determined based on the          \ncontractual maturity of the lease. For leases \nwhere the firm has the option to terminate or \nextend the lease, an assessment of the        \nlikelihood of exercising the option is        \nincorporated into the determination of the    \nlease term. Such assessment is initially      \nperformed at the inception of the lease and is\nupdated if events occur that impact the       \noriginal assessment. An operating lease right-\nof-useasset is initially determined based on  \nthe operating lease liability, adjusted for   \ninitial direct costs, lease incentives and    \namounts paid at or prior to lease             \ncommencement. This amount is then amortized   \nover the lease term. The firm recognized $    \n108million for the three months ended March   \n2021 and $ 51million for the three months     \nended March 2020 of right-of-useassets and    \noperating lease liabilities in non-           \ncashtransactions for leases entered into or   \nassumed. See Note 15 for information about    \noperating lease liabilities. For leases where \nthe firm will derive no economic benefit from \nleased space that it has vacated or where the \nfirm has shortened the term of a lease when   \nspace is no longer needed, the firm will      \nrecord an impairment or accelerated           \namortization of right-of-useassets.

The Trust\nissued $ 2.75billion of guaranteed preferred  \nbeneficial interests (Trust Preferred         \nsecurities) to third parties and $ 85million  \nof common beneficial interests to Group Inc.  \nAs of both March 2021 and December 2020, the  \noutstanding par amount of junior subordinated \ndebt held by the Trust was $ 968million and   \nthe outstanding par amount of Trust Preferred \nsecurities and common beneficial interests    \nissued by the Trust was $ 939million and $    \n29million, respectively. The Trust is a       \nwholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm   \nfor regulatory and legal purposes but is not  \nconsolidated for accounting purposes. The firm\npays interest semi-annually on the junior     \nsubordinated debt at an annual rate of 6.345% \nand the debt matures on February 15, 2034. The\ncoupon rate and the payment dates applicable  \nto the beneficial interests are the same as   \nthe interest rate and payment dates for the   \njunior subordinated debt. The firm has the    \nright, from time to time, to defer payment of \ninterest on the junior subordinated debt, and \ntherefore cause payment on the Trust\u2019s        \npreferred beneficial interests to be deferred,\nin each case up to ten consecutive semi-annual\nperiods. During any such deferral period, the \nfirm will not be permitted to, among other    \nthings, pay dividends on or make certain      \nrepurchases of its common stock.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) In the table above, the weighted  \naverage discount rate represents the firm\u2019s   \nincremental borrowing rate as of January 2019 \nfor operating leases existing on the date of  \nadoption of ASU No. 2016-02,\u201cLeases (Topic    \n842),\u201d and at the lease inception date for    \nleases entered into subsequent to the adoption\nof this ASU. Operating lease costs were $     \n120million for the three months ended March   \n2021 and $ 113million for the three months    \nended March 2020. Variable lease costs, which \nare included in operating lease costs, were   \nnot material for both the three months ended  \nMarch 2021 and March 2020. Total occupancy    \nexpenses for space held in excess of the      \nfirm\u2019s current requirements were not material \nfor both the three months ended March 2021 and\nMarch 2020. Lease payments relating to        \noperating lease arrangements that were signed,\nbut had not yet commenced were $ 428million as\nof March 2021. Note 16. Securitization        \nActivities The firm securitizes residential   \nand commercial mortgages, corporate bonds,    \nloans and other types of financial assets by  \nselling these assets to securitization        \nvehicles (e.g., trusts, corporate entities and\nlimited liability companies) or through a     \nresecuritization. The firm acts as underwriter\nof the beneficial interests that are sold to  \ninvestors. The firm\u2019s residential mortgage    \nsecuritizations are primarily in connection   \nwith government agency securitizations. The   \nfirm accounts for a securitization as a sale  \nwhen it has relinquished control over the     \ntransferred financial assets. Prior to        \nsecuritization, the firm generally accounts   \nfor assets pending transfer at fair value and \ntherefore does not typically recognize        \nsignificant gains or losses upon the transfer \nof assets. Net revenues from underwriting     \nactivities are recognized in connection with  \nthe sales of the underlying beneficial        \ninterests to investors.

The firm        \nreassesses its determination of whether it is \nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing\nbasis based on current facts and              \ncircumstances. VIE Activities The firm is     \nprincipally involved with VIEs through the    \nfollowing business activities: Mortgage-Backed\nVIEs. The firm sells residential and          \ncommercial mortgage loans and securities to   \nmortgage-backed VIEs and may retain beneficial\ninterests in the assets sold to these VIEs.   \nThe firm purchases and sells beneficial       \ninterests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in   \nconnection with market-making activities. In  \naddition, the firm may enter into derivatives \nwith certain of these VIEs, primarily interest\nrate swaps, which are typically not variable  \ninterests. The firm generally enters into     \nderivatives with other counterparties to      \nmitigate its risk. Real Estate, Credit- and   \nPower-Related and Other Investing VIEs. The   \nfirm purchases equity and debt securities     \nissued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold   \nreal estate, performing and nonperforming     \ndebt, distressed loans, power-related assets  \nand equity securities. The firm generally does\nnot sell assets to, or enter into derivatives \nwith, these VIEs. Corporate Debt and Other    \nAsset-Backed VIEs. The firm structures VIEs   \nthat issue notes to clients, purchases and    \nsells beneficial interests issued by corporate\ndebt and other asset-backed VIEs in connection\nwith market-making activities, and makes loans\nto VIEs that warehouse corporate debt. Certain\nof these VIEs synthetically create the        \nexposure for the beneficial interests they    \nissue by entering into credit derivatives with\nthe firm, rather than purchasing the          \nunderlying assets. In addition, the firm may  \nenter into derivatives, such as total return  \nswaps, with certain corporate debt and other  \nasset-backed VIEs, under which the firm pays  \nthe VIE a return due to the beneficial        \ninterest holders and receives the return on   \nthe collateral owned by the VIE. The          \ncollateral owned by these VIEs is primarily   \nother asset-backed loans and securities. The  \nfirm may be removed as the total return swap  \ncounterparty and may enter into derivatives   \nwith other counterparties to mitigate its risk\nrelated to these swaps. The firm may sell     \nassets to the corporate debt and other asset- \nbacked VIEs it structures.                    \n                                            \n  61    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Commercial Lending. The firm\u2019s    \ncommercial lending commitments were primarily \nextended to investment-grade corporate        \nborrowers. Such commitments primarily included\n$ 113.86billion as of March 2021 and $        \n110.31billion as of December 2020, related to \nrelationship lending activities (principally  \nused for operating and general corporate      \npurposes) and $ 29.32billion as of March 2021 \nand $ 15.81billion as of December 2020,       \nrelated to other investment banking activities\n(generally extended for contingent acquisition\nfinancing and are often intended to be short- \nterm in nature, as borrowers often seek to    \nreplace them with other funding sources). The \nfirm also extends lending commitments in      \nconnection with other types of corporate      \nlending, as well as commercial real estate    \nfinancing. See Note 9 for further information \nabout funded loans. To mitigate the credit    \nrisk associated with the firm\u2019s commercial    \nlending activities, the firm obtains credit   \nprotection on certain loans and lending       \ncommitments through credit default swaps, both\nsingle-name and index-based contracts, and    \nthrough the issuance of credit-linked notes.  \nIn addition, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, \nInc. provides the firm with credit loss       \nprotection on certain approved loan           \ncommitments. Warehouse Financing. The firm    \nprovides financing to clients who warehouse   \nfinancial assets. These arrangements are      \nsecured by the warehoused assets, primarily   \nconsisting of residential real estate,        \nconsumer and corporate loans. Credit Cards.   \nThe firm\u2019s credit card lending commitments    \nincluded $ 24.54billion as of March 2021 and $\n21.64billion as of December 2020 related to   \ncredit card lines issued by the firm to       \nconsumers. These credit card lines are        \ncancellable by the firm. Credit card          \ncommitments also includes approximately $     \n2.0billion relating to the firm\u2019s commitment  \nto acquire a credit card portfolio in         \nconnection with its agreement, in January     \n2021, to form a co-brandedcredit card         \nrelationship with General Motors. This amount \nrepresents the portfolio\u2019s outstanding credit \ncard loan balance as of March 2021; however,  \nthe final amount will depend on the           \noutstanding balance of credit card loans at   \nthe time that the acquisition closes, which is\nexpected to be in the third quarter of 2021.  \nRisk Participations The firm also risk        \nparticipates certain of its commercial lending\ncommitments to other financial institutions.  \nIn the event of a risk participant\u2019s default, \nthe firm will be responsible to fund the      \nborrower. Collateralized Agreement            \nCommitments/ Collateralized Financing         \nCommitments Collateralized agreement          \ncommitments includes forward starting resale  \nand securities borrowing agreements, and      \ncollateralized financing commitments includes \nforward starting repurchase and secured       \nlending agreements that settle at a future    \ndate, generally within three business days.   \nCollateralized agreement commitments also     \nincludes transactions where the firm has      \nentered into commitments to provide contingent\nfinancing to its clients and counterparties   \nthrough resale agreements. The firm\u2019s funding \nof these commitments depends on the           \nsatisfaction of all contractual conditions to \nthe resale agreement and these commitments can\nexpire unused. Letters of Credit The firm has \ncommitments under letters of credit issued by \nvarious banks which the firm provides to      \ncounterparties in lieu of securities or cash  \nto satisfy various collateral and margin      \ndeposit requirements.

The firm enters into   \nvarious derivatives that meet the definition  \nof a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including     \nwritten equity and commodity put options,     \nwritten currency contracts and interest rate  \ncaps, floors and swaptions. These derivatives \nare risk managed together with derivatives    \nthat do not meet the definition of a          \nguarantee, and therefore the amounts in the   \ntable above do not reflect the firm\u2019s overall \nrisk related to derivative activities.        \nDisclosures about derivatives are not required\nif they may be cash settled and the firm has  \nno basis to conclude it is probable that the  \ncounterparties held the underlying instruments\nat inception of the contract. The firm has    \nconcluded that these conditions have been met \nfor certain large, internationally active     \ncommercial and investment bank counterparties,\ncentral clearing counterparties, hedge funds  \nand certain other counterparties.Accordingly, \nthe firm has not included such contracts in   \nthe table above. See Note 7 for information   \nabout credit derivatives that meet the        \ndefinition of a guarantee, which are not      \nincluded in the table above. Derivatives are  \naccounted for at fair value and therefore the \ncarrying value is considered the best         \nindication of payment/performance risk for    \nindividual contracts. However, the carrying   \nvalues in the table above exclude the effect  \nof counterparty and cash collateral netting.  \nSecurities Lending and Clearing Guarantees.   \nSecurities lending and clearing guarantees    \ninclude the indemnifications and guarantees   \nthat the firm provides in its capacity as an  \nagency lender and in its capacity as a        \nsponsoring member of the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. As an agency lender, the firm    \nindemnifies most of its securities lending    \ncustomers against losses incurred in the event\nthat borrowers do not return securities and   \nthe collateral held is insufficient to cover  \nthe market value of the securities borrowed.  \nThe maximum payout of such indemnifications   \nwas $ 18.93billion as of March 2021 and $     \n19.86billion as of December 2020. Collateral  \nheld by the lenders in connection with        \nsecurities lending indemnifications was $     \n19.52billion as of March 2021 and $           \n20.39billion as of December 2020. Because the \ncontractual nature of these arrangements      \nrequires the firm to obtain collateral with a \nmarket value that exceeds the value of the    \nsecurities lent to the borrower, there is     \nminimal performance risk associated with these\nindemnifications.                             \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    66  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) As a sponsoring member of the     \nGovernment Securities Division of the Fixed   \nIncome Clearing Corporation, the firm         \nguarantees the performance of its sponsored   \nmember clients to the Fixed Income Clearing   \nCorporation in connection with certain resale \nand repurchase agreements. To minimize        \npotential losses on such guarantees, the firm \nobtains a security interest in the collateral \nthat the sponsored client placed with the     \nFixed Income Clearing Corporation. Therefore, \nthe risk of loss on such guarantees is        \nminimal. There were no amounts outstanding    \nunder the guarantee as of March 2021. As of   \nDecember 2020, the maximum payout on this     \nguarantee was $ 1.49billion and the related   \ncollateral held was $ 1.50billion. Other      \nFinancial Guarantees. In the ordinary course  \nof business, the firm provides other financial\nguarantees of the obligations of third parties\n(e.g., standby letters of credit and other    \nguarantees to enable clients to complete      \ntransactions and fund-related guarantees).    \nThese guarantees represent obligations to make\npayments to beneficiaries if the guaranteed   \nparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a \ncontractual arrangement with that beneficiary.\nOther financial guarantees also include a     \nguarantee that the firm has provided to the   \nGovernment of Malaysia that it will receive at\nleast $ 1.4billion in assets and proceeds from\nassets seized by governmental authorities     \naround the world related to 1Malaysia         \nDevelopment Berhad, a sovereign wealth fund in\nMalaysia (1MDB). The firm evaluates progress  \ntoward satisfying this obligation based on    \ninformation that it receives on a semi-annual \nbasis, expected in February and August. As of \nMarch 2021, approximately $ 220million in     \nassets or proceeds from assets has been       \nreturned to the Government of Malaysia in     \nconnection with this guarantee, which must be \nsatisfied by August 18, 2025. Any amounts paid\nby the firm under this guarantee would be     \nsubject to reimbursement in the event the     \nassets or proceeds received by the Government \nof Malaysia through August 18, 2028 exceeds $ \n1.4billion. See Note 27 for further           \ninformation about matters related to 1MDB.    \nGuarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts. The\nfirm has established trusts, including Goldman\nSachs Capital I, the APEX Trusts and other    \nentities, for the limited purpose of issuing  \nsecurities to third parties, lending the      \nproceeds to the firm and entering into        \ncontractual arrangements with the firm and    \nthird parties related to this purpose. The    \nfirm does not consolidate these entities. See \nNote 14 for further information about the     \ntransactions involving Goldman Sachs Capital I\nand the APEX Trusts. The firm effectively     \nprovides for the full and unconditional       \nguarantee of the securities issued by these   \nentities. Timely payment by the firm of       \namounts due to these entities under the       \nguarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and     \nrelated contractual arrangements will be      \nsufficient to cover payments due on the       \nsecurities issued by these entities. No       \nsubsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the       \nsecurities of Goldman Sachs Capital I or the  \nAPEX Trusts. Management believes that it is   \nunlikely that any circumstances will occur,   \nsuch as nonperformance on the part of paying  \nagents or other service providers, that would \nmake it necessary for the firm to make        \npayments related to these entities other than \nthose required under the terms of the         \nguarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and     \nrelated contractual arrangements and in       \nconnection with certain expenses incurred by  \nthese entities. Indemnities and Guarantees of \nService Providers. In the ordinary course of  \nbusiness, the firm indemnifies and guarantees \ncertain service providers, such as clearing   \nand custody agents, trustees and              \nadministrators, against specified potential   \nlosses in connection with their acting as an  \nagent of, or providing services to, the firm  \nor its affiliates. The firm may also be liable\nto some clients or other parties for losses   \narising from its custodial role or caused by  \nacts or omissions of third-party service      \nproviders, including sub-custodiansand third- \nparty brokers. In certain cases, the firm has \nthe right to seek indemnification from these  \nthird-party service providers for certain     \nrelevant losses incurred by the firm. In      \naddition, the firm is a member of payment,    \nclearing and settlement networks, as well as  \nsecurities exchanges around the world that may\nrequire the firm to meet the obligations of   \nsuch networks and exchanges in the event of   \nmember defaults and other loss scenarios. In  \nconnection with the firm\u2019s prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear \nand settle on behalf of its clients the       \ntransactions entered into by them with other  \nbrokerage firms. The firm\u2019s obligations in    \nrespect of such transactions are secured by   \nthe assets in the client\u2019s account, as well as\nany proceeds received from the transactions   \ncleared and settled by the firm on behalf of  \nthe client. In connection with joint venture  \ninvestments, the firm may issue loan          \nguarantees under which it may be liable in the\nevent of fraud, misappropriation,             \nenvironmental liabilities and certain other   \nmatters involving the borrower. The firm is   \nunable to develop an estimate of the maximum  \npayout under these guarantees and             \nindemnifications. However, management believes\nthat it is unlikely the firm will have to make\nany material payments under these             \narrangements, and no material liabilities     \nrelated to these guarantees and               \nindemnifications have been recognized in the  \nconsolidated balance sheets as of both March  \n2021 and December 2020.                       \n                                            \n  67    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Other Representations, Warranties \nand Indemnifications. The firm provides       \nrepresentations and warranties to             \ncounterparties in connection with a variety of\ncommercial transactions and occasionally      \nindemnifies them against potential losses     \ncaused by the breach of those representations \nand warranties. The firm may also provide     \nindemnifications protecting against changes in\nor adverse application of certain U.S. tax    \nlaws in connection with ordinary-course       \ntransactions, such as securities issuances,   \nborrowings or derivatives. In addition, the   \nfirm may provide indemnifications to some     \ncounterparties to protect them in the event   \nadditional taxes are owed or payments are     \nwithheld, due either to a change in or an     \nadverse application of certain non-U.S.tax    \nlaws. These indemnifications generally are    \nstandard contractual terms and are entered    \ninto in the ordinary course of business.      \nGenerally, there are no stated or notional    \namounts included in these indemnifications,   \nand the contingencies triggering the          \nobligation to indemnify are not expected to   \noccur. The firm is unable to develop an       \nestimate of the maximum payout under these    \nguarantees and indemnifications. However,     \nmanagement believes that it is unlikely the   \nfirm will have to make any material payments  \nunder these arrangements, and no material     \nliabilities related to these arrangements have\nbeen recognized in the consolidated balance   \nsheets as of both March 2021 and December     \n2020. Guarantees of Subsidiaries. Group Inc.  \nis the entity that fully and unconditionally  \nguarantees the securities issued by GS Finance\nCorp., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of   \nthe firm. Group Inc. has guaranteed the       \npayment obligations of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n(GS&Co.), GS Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Paris \nInc. et Cie, subject to certain exceptions. In\naddition, Group Inc. has provided guarantees  \nto Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and      \nGoldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE) related to\nagreements that each entity has entered into  \nwith certain of its counterparties.           \nFurthermore, Group Inc. provided a guarantee  \nto GS Bank USA in 2020 related to securities  \nthat GS Bank USA acquired from certain        \naffiliated funds of Group Inc. and loans and  \nlending commitments that GS Bank USA acquired \nfrom certain subsidiaries ofGroup Inc. As of  \nMarch 2021, none of the securities acquired   \nfrom the affiliated funds were outstanding.   \nGroup Inc. guarantees many of the obligations \nof its other consolidated subsidiaries on a   \ntransaction-by-transactionbasis, as negotiated\nwith counterparties. Group Inc. is unable to  \ndevelop an estimate of the maximum payout     \nunder its subsidiary guarantees. However,     \nbecause these obligations are also obligations\nof consolidated subsidiaries, Group Inc.\u2019s    \nliabilities as guarantor are not separately   \ndisclosed.                                    \nNote 19.                                      \nShareholders\u2019 Equity                          \nCommon Equity                                 \nAs of both March 2021\nand December 2020, the\nfirm had 4.00billion\nauthorized shares of\ncommon stock and\n200million authorized\nshares of nonvoting\ncommon stock, each with\na par value of $\n0.01per share.\nThe firm\u2019s share\nrepurchase program is\nintended to help\nmaintain the\nappropriate level of\ncommon equity. The\nshare repurchase\nprogram is effected\nprimarily through\nregular open-market\npurchases (which may\ninclude repurchase\nplans designed to\ncomply with Rule 10b5-1\nand accelerated share\nrepurchases), the\namounts and timing of\nwhich are determined\nprimarily by the firm\u2019s\ncurrent and projected\ncapital position, and\ncapital deployment\nopportunities, but\nwhich may also be\ninfluenced by general\nmarket conditions and\nthe prevailing price\nand trading volumes of\nthe firm\u2019s common\nstock. The firm\nsuspended stock\nrepurchases during the\nfirst quarter of 2020\nand, consistent with\nthe FRB\u2019s requirement\nfor all large bank\nholding companies\n(BHCs), extended the\nsuspension of stock\nrepurchases through the\nfourth quarter of 2020.\nThe firm resumed stock\nrepurchases in the\nfirst quarter of 2021.\nThe table below\npresents information\nabout common stock\nrepurchases.\n                                              \n                    Three Months              \n                     Ended March              \n  in\u00a0millions,                                \n  except per                2021        2020  \n  share amounts                               \n  Common share               8.7         8.2  \n  repurchases                                 \n  Average cost           $310.04     $236.35  \n  per share                                   \n  Total cost of                               \n  common share            $2,700    $\u00a0\u00a01,928  \n  repurchases                                 \n                                              \nPursuant to the terms\nof certain share-based\ncompensation plans,\nemployees may remit\nshares to the firm or\nthe firm may cancel\nshare-based awards to\nsatisfy statutory\nemployee tax\nwithholding\nrequirements.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements    \n(Unaudited) Note 20. Regulation and Capital   \nAdequacy The FRB is the primary regulator of  \nGroup Inc., a BHC under the U.S. Bank Holding \nCompany Act of 1956 and a financial holding   \ncompany under amendments to this Act. The firm\nis subject to consolidated regulatory capital \nrequirements which are calculated in          \naccordance with the regulations of the FRB    \n(Capital Framework). The capital requirements \nare expressed as risk-based capital and       \nleverage ratios that compare measures of      \nregulatory capital to risk-weighted assets    \n(RWAs), average assets and off-balancesheet   \nexposures. Failure to comply with these       \ncapital requirements could result in          \nrestrictions being imposed by the firm\u2019s      \nregulators and could limit the firm\u2019s ability \nto repurchase shares, pay dividends and make  \ncertain discretionary compensation payments.  \nThe firm\u2019s capital levels are also subject to \nqualitative judgments by the regulators about \ncomponents of capital, risk weightings and    \nother factors. Furthermore, certain of the    \nfirm\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to separate   \nregulations and capital requirements. Capital \nFramework The regulations under the Capital   \nFramework are largely based on the Basel      \nCommittee on Banking Supervision\u2019s (Basel     \nCommittee) capital framework for strengthening\ninternational capital standards (Basel III)   \nand also implement certain provisions of the  \nDodd-Frank Act. Under the Capital Framework,  \nthe firm is an \u201cAdvanced approach\u201d banking    \norganization and has been designated as a     \nglobal systemically important bank (G-SIB).   \nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum    \nrisk-based capital and the capital            \nconservation buffer requirements. The buffer  \nmust consist entirely of capital that         \nqualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)      \ncapital.                                      \nThe firm calculates its\nCET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital and Total\ncapital ratios in\naccordance with both\nthe Standardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules.\nEach of the ratios\ncalculated under the\nStandardized and\nAdvanced Capital Rules\nmust meet itsrespective\ncapital requirements.\n\nUnder the Capital\nFramework, the firm is\nalso subject to\nleverage requirements\nwhich consist of a\nminimum Tier 1 leverage\nratio and a minimum\nsupplementary leverage\nratio (SLR), as well as\nthe SLR buffer.\nConsolidated Regulatory                       \nCapital Requirements                          \nRisk-Based Capital\nRatios.

These requirements also        \n       include the capital conservation       \n  \u2022    buffer requirements, consisting of     \n       theG-SIBsurcharge of2.5% (Method\u00a02)    \n       and the countercyclical capital        \n       buffer, which the FRB has set          \n       tozeropercent. In addition, the        \n       capital conservation buffer            \n       requirements include thestress         \n       capital buffer (SCB)of6.6% under the   \n       Standardized Capital Rules and a       \n       buffer of2.5% under the Advanced       \n       Capital Rules.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       TheG-SIBsurcharge is updated annually  \n       based on financial data from the       \n       prior year and is generally            \n       applicable for the following year.     \n       TheG-SIBsurcharge is calculated using  \n       two methodologies, the higher of       \n       which is reflected in the firm\u2019s       \n       risk-based capital requirements.

For\nrisk management\npurposes, a 95 % one-\nday VaR is used,\nwhereas for regulatory\ncapital requirements,\na 99 % 10-day VaR is\nused to determine\nMarket RWAs and a 99 %\none-day VaR is used to\ndetermine regulatory\nVaR exceptions.

As of both\nMarch\u00a02021 and\nDecember\u00a02020, GSIB\nand GSBE were in\ncompliance with their\nregulatory capital\nrequirements.\nOther. The deposits of GS Bank USA are insured\nby the FDIC to the extent provided by law. The\nFRB requires that GS Bank USA maintain cash   \nreserves with the Federal Reserve. As of both \nMarch 2021 and December 2020, the reserve     \nrequirement ratio was zero percent. The amount\ndeposited by GS Bank USA at the Federal       \nReserve was $ 95.92billion as of March 2021   \nand $ 52.71billion as of December 2020.       \nRestrictions on Payments Group Inc. may be    \nlimited in its ability to access capital held \nat certain subsidiaries as a result of        \nregulatory, tax or other constraints. These   \nlimitations include provisions of applicable  \nlaw and regulations and other regulatory      \nrestrictions that limit the ability of those  \nsubsidiaries to declare and pay dividends     \nwithout prior regulatory approval. Also, as a \nresult of GS Bank USA\u2019s election to exclude   \nholdings of U.S. Treasury securities and      \ndeposits at the Federal Reserve from its total\nleverage exposure, any dividend by GS Bank USA\nduring the period from July 1, 2020 through   \nMarch 31, 2021 was subject to the prior       \napproval of the FRB. Furthermore, the amount  \nof dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA  \narelimited to the lesser of the amounts       \ncalculated under a recent earnings test and an\nundivided profits test. The FRB, the FDIC and \nthe NYDFS have authority to prohibit or to    \nlimit the payment of dividends by the banking \norganizations they supervise (including GS    \nBank USA) if, in the regulator\u2019s opinion,     \npayment of a dividend would constitute an     \nunsafe or unsound practice in light of the    \nfinancial condition of the banking            \norganization. In addition, subsidiaries not   \nsubject to separate regulatory capital        \nrequirements may hold capital to satisfy local\ntax and legal guidelines, rating agency       \nrequirements (for entities with assigned      \ncredit ratings) or internal policies,         \nincluding policies concerning the minimum     \namount of capital a subsidiary should hold    \nbased on its underlying level of risk. Group  \nInc.\u2019s equity investment in subsidiaries was $\n106.06billion as of March 2021 and $          \n103.80billion as of December 2020, of which   \nGroup Inc. was required to maintain $         \n68.96billion as of March 2021 and $           \n63.68billion as of December 2020, of minimum  \nequity capital in its regulated subsidiaries  \nin order to satisfy the regulatory            \nrequirements of such subsidiaries.

Income Taxes Provision for Income    \nTaxes Income taxes are provided for using the \nasset and liability method under which        \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities are       \nrecognized for temporary differences between  \nthe financial reporting and tax bases of      \nassets and liabilities. The firm reports      \ninterest expense related to income tax matters\nin provision for taxes and income tax         \npenalties in other expenses. Deferred Income  \nTaxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net   \ntax effects of temporary differences between  \nthe financial reporting and tax bases of      \nassets and liabilities. These temporary       \ndifferences result in taxable or deductible   \namounts in future years and are measured using\nthe tax rates and laws that will be in effect \nwhen such differences are expected to reverse.\nValuation allowances are established to reduce\ndeferred tax assets to the amount that more   \nlikely than not will be realized and primarily\nrelate to the ability to utilize losses in    \nvarious tax jurisdictions. Tax assets are     \nincluded in other assets and tax liabilities  \nare included in other liabilities.            \nUnrecognized Tax Benefits The firm recognizes \ntax positions in the consolidated financial   \nstatements only when it is more likely than   \nnot that the position will be sustained on    \nexamination by the relevant taxing authority  \nbased on the technical merits of the position.\nA position that meets this standard is        \nmeasured at the largest amount of benefit that\nwill more likely than not be realized on      \nsettlement. A liability is established for    \ndifferences between positions taken in a tax  \nreturn and amounts recognized in the          \nconsolidated financial statements. Regulatory \nTax Examinations The firm is subject to       \nexamination by the U.S. Internal Revenue      \nService (IRS) and other taxing authorities in \njurisdictions where the firm has significant  \nbusiness operations, such as the United       \nKingdom, Japan, Hong Kong and various states, \nsuch as New York. The tax years under         \nexamination vary by jurisdiction. The firm    \ndoes not expect completion of these audits to \nhave a material impact on the firm\u2019s financial\ncondition, but it may be material to operating\nresults for a particular period, depending, in\npart, on the operating results for that       \nperiod.                                       \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    80  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

This\nprogram allows the\nfirm to work with the\nIRS to identify and\nresolve potential U.S.\nFederal tax issues\nbefore the filing of\ntax returns. The\nfieldwork for tax\nyears 2011 through\n2017 has been\ncompleted and the\nfinal resolution is\nnot expected to have a\nmaterial impact on the\neffective tax rate.\nThe 2018 and 2019 tax\nyears remain subject\nto post-filing review.\nNew York State and\nCity examinations of\n2015 through 2018\ncommenced during the\nfirst quarter of 2021.\n\nAll years, including\nand subsequent to the\nyears in the table\nabove, remain open to\nexamination by the\ntaxing authorities.\nThe firm believes that\nthe liability for\nunrecognized tax\nbenefits it has\nestablished is\nadequate in relation\nto the potential for\nadditional\nassessments.\nNote 25. Business Segments The firm reports   \nits activities in four business segments:     \nInvestment Banking, Global Markets, Asset     \nManagement and Consumer & Wealth Management.  \nSee Note 1 for information about the firm\u2019s   \nbusiness segments. Compensation and benefits  \nexpenses in the firm\u2019s segments reflect, among\nother factors, the overall performance of the \nfirm, as well as the performance of individual\nbusinesses. Consequently, pre-taxmargins in   \none segment of the firm\u2019s business may be     \nsignificantly affected by the performance of  \nthe firm\u2019s other business segments. The firm  \nallocates assets (including allocations of    \nglobal core liquid assets and cash, secured   \nclient financing and other assets), revenues  \nand expenses among the four business segments.\nDue to the integrated nature of these         \nsegments, estimates and judgments are made in \nallocating certain assets, revenues and       \nexpenses. The allocation process is based on  \nthe manner in which management currently views\nthe performance of the segments. The          \nallocation of common shareholders\u2019 equity and \npreferred stock dividends to each segment is  \nbased on the estimated amount of equity       \nrequired to support the activities of the     \nsegment under relevant regulatory capital     \nrequirements. Net earnings for each segment is\ncalculated by applying the firmwide tax rate  \nto each segment\u2019s pre-taxearnings. Management \nbelieves that this allocation provides a      \nreasonable representation of each segment\u2019s   \ncontribution to consolidated net earnings to  \ncommon, return on average common equity and   \ntotal assets. Transactions between segments   \nare based on specific criteria or approximate \nthird-party rates.                            \n                                            \n  81    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\nfirm seeks to mitigate\ncredit risk by\nactively monitoring\nexposures and\nobtaining collateral\nfrom counterparties as\ndeemed appropriate.\nThe firm measures and\nmonitors its credit\nexposure based on\namounts owed to the\nfirm after taking into\naccount risk mitigants\nthat the firm\nconsiders when\ndetermining credit\nrisk. Such risk\nmitigants include\nnetting and collateral\narrangements and\neconomic hedges, such\nas credit derivatives,\nfutures and forward\ncontracts.

As of the date\nhereof, the firm has estimated the upper end  \nof the range of reasonably possible aggregate \nloss for such matters and for any other       \nmatters described below where management has  \nbeen able to estimate a range of reasonably   \npossible aggregate loss to be approximately $ \n1.0billion in excess of the aggregate reserves\nfor such matters. Management is generally     \nunable to estimate a range of reasonably      \npossible loss for matters other than those    \nincluded in the estimate above, including     \nwhere (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have \nnot claimed an amount of money damages, except\nin those instances where management can       \notherwise determine an appropriate amount,    \n(ii) matters are in early stages, (iii)       \nmatters relate to regulatory investigations or\nreviews, except in those instances where      \nmanagement can otherwise determine an         \nappropriate amount, (iv) there is uncertainty \nas to the likelihood of a class being         \ncertified or the ultimate size of the class,  \n(v) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of \npending appeals or motions, (vi) there are    \nsignificant factual issues to be resolved,    \nand/or (vii) there are novel legal issues     \npresented. For example, the firm\u2019s potential  \nliabilities with respect to the investigations\nand reviews described below in \u201cRegulatory    \nInvestigations and Reviews and Related        \nLitigation\u201d generally are not included in     \nmanagement\u2019s estimate of reasonably possible  \nloss. However, management does not believe,   \nbased on currently available information, that\nthe outcomes of such other matters will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the firm\u2019s         \nfinancial condition, though the outcomes could\nbe material to the firm\u2019s operating results   \nfor any particular period, depending, in part,\nupon the operating results for such period.   \nSee Note 18 for further information about     \nmortgage-related contingencies. 1MDB-Related  \nMatters Between 2012 and 2013, subsidiaries of\nthe firm acted as arrangers or purchasers of  \napproximately $ 6.5billion of debt securities \nof 1MDB. On November 1, 2018, the U.S.        \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) unsealed a        \ncriminal information and guilty plea by Tim   \nLeissner, a former participating managing     \ndirector of the firm, and an indictment       \nagainst Ng Chong Hwa, a former managing       \ndirector of the firm, and Low Taek Jho.       \nLeissner pleaded guilty to a two-countcriminal\ninformation charging him with conspiring to   \nlaunder money and conspiring to violate the   \nU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\u2019s (FCPA)   \nanti-bribery and internal accounting controls \nprovisions. Low and Ng were charged in a      \nthree-count indictment with conspiring to     \nlaunder money and conspiring to violate the   \nFCPA\u2019s anti-bribery provisions. On August 28, \n2018, Leissner\u2019s guilty plea was accepted by  \nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern       \nDistrict of New York and Leissner was         \nadjudicated guilty on both counts. Ng was also\ncharged in this indictment with conspiring to \nviolate the FCPA\u2019s internal accounting        \ncontrols provisions. On May 6, 2019, Ng       \npleaded not guilty to the DOJ\u2019s criminal      \ncharges. On August 18, 2020, the firm         \nannounced that it entered into a settlement   \nagreement with the Government of Malaysia to  \nresolve the criminal and regulatory           \nproceedings in Malaysia involving the firm,   \nwhich includes a guarantee that the Government\nof Malaysia receives at least $ 1.4billion in \nassets and proceeds from assets seized by     \ngovernmental authorities around the world     \nrelated to 1MDB. On October 22, 2020, the firm\nannounced that it reached settlements of      \ngovernmental and regulatory investigations    \nrelating to 1MDB with the DOJ, the SEC, the   \nFRB, the NYDFS, the FCA, the PRA, the         \nSingapore Attorney General\u2019s Chambers, the    \nSingapore Commercial Affairs Department, the  \nMonetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong  \nKong Securities and Futures Commission. Group \nInc. entered into a three-year deferred       \nprosecution agreement with the DOJ, in which a\ncharge against the firm, one count of         \nconspiracy to violate the FCPA, was filed and \nwill later be dismissed if the firm abides by \nthe terms of the agreement. In addition, GS   \nMalaysia pleaded guilty to one count of       \nconspiracy to violate the FCPA. The firm has  \nbeen working to secure necessary exemptions   \nand authorizations from regulators so that    \nthese settlements do not impact the firm\u2019s    \nactivities or the services that it provides to\nclients. In October 2020, the firm submitted  \nits application to the U.S. Department of     \nLabor (DOL) to maintain its status as a       \nqualified professional asset manager (QPAM)   \nand in January 2021 the DOL published for     \npublic comment a notice of proposed exemption.\nThe firm expects to obtain the exemption      \nbefore the sentencing of GS Malaysia.         \n                                            \n  85    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q  \n                                            \nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The     \nparties have agreed to stay proceedings       \npending resolution of the books and records   \ndemand. On February 19, 2019, a purported     \nshareholder derivative action relating to 1MDB\nwas filed in the U.S. District Court for the  \nSouthern District of New York against Group   \nInc. and the directors at the time and a      \nformer chairman and chief executive officer of\nthe firm. The second amended complaint filed  \non November 13, 2020, alleges breaches of     \nfiduciary duties, including in connection with\nalleged insider trading by certain current and\nformer directors, unjust enrichment and       \nviolations of the anti-fraud provisions of the\nExchange Act, including in connection with    \nGroup Inc.\u2019s common stock repurchases and     \nsolicitation of proxies, and seeks unspecified\ndamages, disgorgement and injunctive relief.  \nDefendants moved to dismiss this action on    \nJanuary 15, 2021.

In June   \n2019, the Board appointed a Special Committee \nto consider the demands and, in January 2021, \nthe Board voted to reject them. Since that    \ntime, the firm has received two additional    \ndemands from alleged shareholders to          \ninvestigate and pursue claims related to 1MDB \n(and, for one of the demands, other matters)  \nagainst other parties, including certain      \ncurrent and former directors and executive    \nofficers of the firm. On December 20, 2018, a \nputative securities class action lawsuit was  \nfiled in the U.S. District Court for the      \nSouthern District of New York against Group   \nInc. and certain former officers of the firm  \nalleging violations of the anti-fraud         \nprovisions of the Exchange Act with respect to\nGroup Inc.\u2019s disclosures and public statements\nconcerning 1MDB and seeking unspecified       \ndamages. The plaintiffs filed the second      \namended complaint on October 28, 2019, which  \nthe defendants moved to dismiss on January 9, \n2020. Mortgage-Related Matters Beginning in   \nApril 2010, a number of purported securities  \nlaw class actions were filed in the U.S.      \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of   \nNew York challenging the adequacy of Group    \nInc.\u2019s public disclosure of, among other      \nthings, the firm\u2019s activities in the          \ncollateralized debt obligation market, and the\nfirm\u2019s conflict of interest management. The   \nconsolidated amended complaint filed on July  \n25, 2011, which named as defendants Group Inc.\nand certain current and former officers and   \nemployees of Group Inc. and its affiliates,   \ngenerally alleges violations of Sections 10(b)\nand 20(a) of the Exchange Act and seeks       \nmonetary damages. The defendants have moved   \nfor summary judgment. On April 7, 2020, the   \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the  \ndistrict court\u2019s August 14, 2018 grant of     \nclass certification. On March 29, 2021, the   \nUnited States Supreme Court heard oral        \nargument on defendants\u2019 petition seeking      \nreview of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019\nApril 7, 2020 decision.

The third amended complaint in \nthe U.S. district court action, filed on      \nAugust 3, 2020, generally alleges that the    \ndefendants violated federal antitrust law and \nstate common law in connection with an alleged\nconspiracy to manipulate the foreign currency \nexchange markets and seeks declaratory and    \ninjunctive relief, as well as unspecified     \namounts of compensatory, punitive, treble and \nother damages. The summary claim form filed in\nthe U.K. action indicates the action is for   \nbreach of U.K. and E.U. competition rules from\n2003 to 2013 and alleges manipulation of      \nforeign exchange rates and bid/offer spreads, \nthe exchange of commercially sensitive        \ninformation among defendants and collusive    \ntrading. Banco Espirito Santo S.A. and Oak    \nFinance Beginning in February 2015, GSI       \ncommenced actions against Novo Banco S.A.     \n(Novo Banco) in the English Commercial Court  \nand the Bank of Portugal (BoP) in Portuguese  \nAdministrative Court in response to BoP\u2019s     \ndecision in December 2014 not to transfer to  \nNovo Banco an $ 835million facility agreement \n(the Facility), structured by GSI, between Oak\nFinance Luxembourg S.A.

In    \nJuly 2018, the English Supreme Court found    \nthat the English courts did not have          \njurisdiction over GSI\u2019s action. In July 2018, \nthe Liquidation Committee for BES issued a    \ndecision seeking to claw back $ 54million paid\nto GSI and $ 50million paid to Oak Finance in \nconnection with the Facility, alleging that   \nGSI acted in bad faith in extending the       \nFacility, including because GSI allegedly knew\nthat BES was at risk of imminent failure.

Based on our reviews, \nwe are not aware of any material modifications\nthat should be made to the accompanying       \ninterim financial statements for them to be in\nconformity with accounting principles         \ngenerally accepted in the United States of    \nAmerica. We have previously audited, in       \naccordance with the standards of the Public   \nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United    \nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance     \nsheet of the Company as of December 31, 2020, \nand the related consolidated statements of    \nearnings, comprehensive income, changes in    \nshareholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for the   \nyear then ended (not presented herein), and in\nour report dated February 19, 2021, we        \nexpressed an unqualified opinion on those     \nconsolidated financial statements. In our     \nopinion, the information set forth in the     \naccompanying consolidated balance sheet as of \nDecember 31, 2020 is fairly stated in all     \nmaterial respects in relation to the          \nconsolidated balance sheet from which it has  \nbeen derived. Basis for Review Results These  \ninterim financial statements are the          \nresponsibility of the Company\u2019s management. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with  \nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent  \nwith respect to the Company in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the      \napplicable rules and regulations of the       \nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the    \nPCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance  \nwith the standards of the PCAOB. A review of  \ninterim financial information consists        \nprincipally of applying analytical procedures \nand making inquiries of persons responsible   \nfor financial and accounting matters. It is   \nsubstantially less in scope than an audit     \nconducted in accordance with the standards of \nthe PCAOB, the objective of which is the      \nexpression of an opinion regarding the        \nfinancial statements taken as a whole.        \nAccordingly, we do not express such an        \nopinion. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP New   \nYork, New York May 3, 2021                    \n                                            \n  93    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Executive Overview We generated \nnet earnings of $6.84 billion for the first   \nquarter of 2021, compared with $1.21 billion  \nfor the first quarter of 2020. Diluted        \nearnings per common share (EPS) was $18.60 for\nthe first quarter of 2021, compared with $3.11\nfor the first quarter of 2020. Annualized     \nreturn on average common shareholders\u2019 equity \n(ROE) was 31.0% for the first quarter of 2021,\ncompared with 5.7% for the first quarter of   \n2020. Book value per common share was $250.81 \nas of March 2021, 6.2% higher compared with   \nDecember 2020. Net revenues were $17.70       \nbillion for the first quarter of 2021, more   \nthan double the amount in the first quarter of\n2020, reflecting higher net revenues across   \nall segments. Net revenues in Asset Management\nwere significantly higher, reflecting strong  \nnet revenues in both Equity investments and   \nLending and debt investments, compared with   \nnet losses in the prior year period due to a  \nchallenging operating environment. Net        \nrevenues were significantly higher in Global  \nMarkets, reflecting strong contributions from \nboth Equities and Fixed Income, Currency and  \nCommodities (FICC), and in Investment Banking,\nreflecting significantly higher net revenues  \nin Underwriting and Financial advisory. Net   \nrevenues in Consumer & Wealth Management were \nhigher, reflecting growth in Wealth management\nand Consumer banking net revenues. Provision  \nfor credit losses was a net benefit of $70    \nmillion for the first quarter of 2021,        \ncompared with net provisions of $937 million  \nfor the first quarter of 2020. The first      \nquarter of 2021 included reserve reductions on\nwholesale and consumer loans reflecting       \ncontinued improvement in the broader economic \nenvironment following challenging conditions  \nthat began in the first quarter of 2020 as a  \nresult of the coronavirus (COVID-19)pandemic, \npartially offset by portfolio growth,         \nincluding provisions related to the pending   \nacquisition of the General Motors co-         \nbrandedcredit card portfolio. Operating       \nexpenses were $9.44 billion for the first     \nquarter of 2021, 46% higher than the first    \nquarter of 2020, primarily due to             \nsignificantly higher compensation and benefits\nexpenses (reflecting strong performance). Our \nefficiency ratio (total operating expenses    \ndivided by total net revenues) for the first  \nquarter of 2021 was 53.3%, compared with 73.9%\nfor the first quarter of 2020.                \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    96  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Review of Net Revenues.   \nIndependent risk oversight and control        \nfunctions ensure adherence to our pricing     \npolicy through a combination of daily         \nprocedures, including the explanation and     \nattribution of net revenues based on the      \nunderlying factors. Through this process, we  \nindependently validate net revenues, identify \nand resolve potential fair value or trade     \nbooking issues on a timely basis and seek to  \nensure that risks are being properly          \ncategorized and quantified. Review of         \nValuation Models. Our independent model risk  \nmanagement group (Model Risk), consisting of  \nquantitative professionals who are separate   \nfrom model developers, performs an independent\nmodel review and validation process of our    \nvaluation models. New or changed models are   \nreviewed and approved prior to implementation.\nModels are reviewed annually to assess the    \nimpact of any changes in the product or market\nand any market developments in pricing        \ntheories. See \u201cRisk Management \u2014 Model Risk   \nManagement\u201d for further information about the \nreview and validation of our valuation models.\nAllowance for Credit Losses We estimate and   \nrecord an allowance for credit losses related \nto our loans held for investment that are     \naccounted for at amortized cost. To determine \nthe allowance for credit losses, we classify  \nour loans accounted for at amortized cost into\nwholesale and consumer portfolios. These      \nportfolios represent the level at which we    \nhave developed and documented our methodology \nto determine the allowance for credit losses. \nThe allowance for credit losses is measured on\na collective basis for loans that exhibit     \nsimilar risk characteristics using a modeled  \napproach and asset-specific basis for loans   \nthat do not share similar risk                \ncharacteristics. The allowance for credit     \nlosses also includes qualitative components   \nwhich allow management to reflect the         \nuncertain nature of economic forecasting,     \ncapture uncertainty regarding model inputs,   \nand account for model imprecision and         \nconcentration risk. The determination of      \nallowance for credit losses entails           \nsignificant judgment on various risk factors. \nRisk factors for wholesale loans include      \ninternal credit ratings, industry default and \nloss data, expected life, macroeconomic       \nindicators (e.g., unemployment rates and GDP),\nthe borrower\u2019s capacity to meet its financial \nobligations, the borrower\u2019s country of risk   \nand industry, loan seniority and collateral   \ntype. In addition, for loans backed by real   \nestate, risk factors include loan-to-         \nvalueratio, debt service ratio and home price \nindex. Risk factors for installment and credit\ncard loans include Fair Isaac Corporation     \n(FICO) credit scores, delinquency status, loan\nvintage and macroeconomic indicators.         \n                                            \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    98  \n                                            \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Our      \nestimate of credit losses entails judgment    \nabout collectability at the reporting dates,  \nand there are uncertainties inherent in those \njudgments. The allowance for credit losses is \nsubject to a governance process that involves \nreview and approval by senior management      \nwithin our independent risk oversight and     \ncontrol functions. Personnel within our       \nindependent risk oversight and control        \nfunctions are responsible for forecasting the \neconomic variables that underlie the economic \nscenarios that are used in the modeling of    \nexpected credit losses. While we use the best \ninformation available to determine this       \nestimate, future adjustments to the allowance \nmay be necessary based on, among other things,\nchanges in the economic environment or        \nvariances between actual results and the      \noriginal assumptions used. Loans are charged  \noff against the allowance for loan losses when\ndeemed to be uncollectible. We also record an \nallowance for credit losses on lending        \ncommitments which are held for investment that\nare accounted for at amortized cost. Such     \nallowance is determined using the same        \nmethodology as the allowance for loan losses, \nwhile also taking into consideration the      \nprobability of drawdowns or funding, and      \nwhether such commitments are cancellable by   \nus. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial  \nstatements for further information about the  \nallowance for credit losses. Use of Estimates \nU.S. GAAP requires us to make certain         \nestimates and assumptions. In addition to the \nestimates we make in connection with fair     \nvalue measurements and the allowance for      \ncredit losses on loans and lending commitments\nheld for investment and accounted for at      \namortized cost, the use of estimates and      \nassumptions is also important in determining  \ndiscretionary compensation accruals, the      \naccounting for goodwill and identifiable      \nintangible assets, provisions for losses that \nmay arise from litigation and regulatory      \nproceedings (including governmental           \ninvestigations), and provisions for losses    \nthat may arise from tax audits. A substantial \nportion of our compensation and benefits      \nrepresents discretionary compensation, which  \nis finalized at year-end.We believe the most  \nappropriate way to allocate estimated year-   \nenddiscretionary compensation among interim   \nperiods is in proportion to the net revenues  \nearned in such periods. In addition to the    \nlevel of net revenues, our overall            \ncompensation expense in any given year is also\ninfluenced by, among other factors, overall   \nfinancial performance, prevailing labor       \nmarkets, business mix, the structure of our   \nshare-based compensation programs and the     \nexternal environment. Goodwill is assessed for\nimpairment annually in the fourth quarter or  \nmore frequently if events occur or            \ncircumstances change that indicate an         \nimpairment may exist. When assessing goodwill \nfor impairment, first, a qualitative          \nassessment can be made to determine whether it\nis more likely than not that the estimated    \nfair value of a reporting unit is less than   \nits estimated carrying value. If the results  \nof the qualitative assessment are not         \nconclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is   \nperformed. Alternatively, a quantitative      \ngoodwill test can be performed without        \nperforming a qualitative assessment.          \nEstimating the fair value of our reporting    \nunits requires judgment. Critical inputs to   \nthe fair value estimates include projected    \nearnings and allocated equity. There is       \ninherent uncertainty in the projected         \nearnings. The estimated carrying value of each\nreporting unit reflects an allocation of total\nshareholders\u2019 equity and represents the       \nestimated amount of total shareholders\u2019 equity\nrequired to support the activities of the     \nreporting unit under currently applicable     \nregulatory capital requirements. See Note 12  \nto the consolidated financial statements for  \nfurther information about goodwill. If we     \nexperience a prolonged or severe period of    \nweakness in the business environment,         \nfinancial markets, our performance or our     \ncommon stock price, or additional increases in\ncapital requirements, our goodwill could be   \nimpaired in the future. Identifiable          \nintangible assets are tested for impairment   \nwhen events or changes in circumstances       \nsuggest that an asset\u2019s or asset group\u2019s      \ncarrying value may not be fully recoverable.  \nJudgment is required to evaluate whether      \nindications of potential impairment have      \noccurred, and to test intangible assets for   \nimpairment, if required. An impairment is     \nrecognized if the estimated undiscounted cash \nflows relating to the asset or asset group is \nless than the corresponding carrying value.   \nSee Note 12 to the consolidated financial     \nstatements for further information about      \nidentifiable intangible assets. We also       \nestimate and provide for potential losses that\nmay arise out of litigation and regulatory    \nproceedings to the extent that such losses are\nprobable and can be reasonably estimated. In  \naddition, we estimate the upper end of the    \nrange of reasonably possible aggregate loss in\nexcess of the related reserves for litigation \nand regulatory proceedings where we believe   \nthe risk of loss is more than slight. See     \nNotes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial \nstatements for information about certain      \njudicial, litigation and regulatory           \nproceedings. Significant judgment is required \nin making these estimates and our final       \nliabilities may ultimately be materially      \ndifferent.

During the first       \nquarter of 2021, improved market and economic \nconditions contributed to a more favorable    \nbackdrop for consumer banking and wealth      \nmanagement activities. Global equity prices   \ngenerally increased and, in the U.S.,         \nunemployment decreased and consumer spending  \nincreased compared with the fourth quarter of \n2020, aided by optimism about the economic    \nrecovery and continued support from central   \nbanks and governments globally. If optimism   \nabout the economic outlook declines or the    \nongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of the \nCOVID-19pandemic are ineffective, it may lead \nto a decline in asset prices, investors       \nfavoring asset classes that typically generate\nlower fees, investors withdrawing their assets\nand consumers withdrawing their deposits or   \ndeterioration in consumer credit, and net     \nrevenues and the provision for credit losses  \nin Consumer & Wealth Management would likely  \nbe negatively impacted. Three Months Ended    \nMarch 2021 versus March 2020. Net revenues in \nConsumer & Wealth Management were $1.74       \nbillion for the first quarter of 2021, 16%    \nhigher than the first quarter of 2020. Net    \nrevenues in Wealth management were $1.37      \nbillion, 13% higher than the first quarter of \n2020, primarily due to higher Management and  \nother fees, reflecting the impact of higher   \naverage AUS. Net revenues in Private banking  \nand lending were higher, primarily reflecting \nhigher net interest income from lending, while\nIncentive fees were lower. Net revenues in    \nConsumer banking were $371 million, 32% higher\nthan the first quarter of 2020, reflecting    \nhigher credit card loan and deposit balances. \nProvision for credit losses was $60 million   \nfor the first quarter of 2021, 64% lower than \nthe first quarter of 2020. The first quarter  \nof 2021 included $180 million of provisions   \nrelated to the pending acquisition of the     \nGeneral Motors co-brandedcredit card          \nportfolio, partially offset by a benefit from \nreserve reductions reflecting continued       \nimprovement in the broader economic           \nenvironment.

We provide further \ninformation about our stress test processes   \nand a summary of the results on our website as\ndescribed in \u201cAvailable Information.\u201d As      \nrequired by the FRB\u2019s CCAR rules, we submit an\nannual capital plan for review by the FRB. The\npurpose of the FRB\u2019s review is to ensure that \nwe have a robust, forward-looking capital     \nplanning process that accounts for our unique \nrisks and that permits continued operation    \nduring times of economic and financial stress.\nWe submitted our 2021 CCAR capital plan in    \nApril 2021 and expect to publish a summary of \nour annual DFAST results in June 2021. See    \n\u201cAvailable Information.\u201d The FRB evaluates us \nbased, in part, on whether we have the capital\nnecessary to continue operating under the     \nbaseline and severely adverse scenarios       \nprovided by the FRB and those developed       \ninternally. This evaluation also takes into   \naccount our process for identifying risk, our \ncontrols and governance for capital planning, \nand our guidelines for making capital planning\ndecisions. In addition, the FRB evaluates our \nplan to make capital distributions (i.e.,     \ndividend payments and repurchases or          \nredemptions of stock, subordinated debt or    \nother capital securities) and issue capital,  \nacross the range of macroeconomic scenarios   \nand firm-specific assumptions. The FRB        \ndetermines the SCB applicable to us based on  \nits own annual stress test. The SCB under the \nStandardized approach is calculated as (i) the\ndifference between our starting and minimum   \nprojected CET1 capital ratios under the       \nsupervisory severely adverse scenario and (ii)\nour planned common stock dividends for each of\nthe fourth through seventh quarters of the    \nplanning horizon, expressed as a percentage of\nrisk-weighted assets (RWAs). Based on our     \nApril 2020 CCAR submission, the FRB has set   \nour SCB at 6.6% for the period from October 1,\n2020 through September 30, 2021. As required  \nby the FRB, we resubmitted our 2020 capital   \nplan in November 2020. The FRB has not changed\nour SCB as a result of this resubmission but  \nhas extended the time period during which it  \ncan recalculate our SCB to June 30, 2021. In  \nlight of the impact of the COVID-19pandemic on\nthe economy, the FRB required all large bank  \nholding companies (BHCs) to suspend stock     \nrepurchases through the fourth quarter of 2020\nand to not increase common stock dividends or \npay common stock dividends in excess of their \naverage net income over the prior four        \nquarters. Beginning in 2021, the FRB modified \nthese restrictions by permitting stock        \nrepurchases and common stock dividends subject\nto the conditions that, in aggregate, such    \namounts do not exceed the average net income  \nover the prior four quarters and that common  \nstock dividends not be increased in the first \nhalf of 2021. We resumed common stock         \nrepurchases in the first quarter of 2021 and  \ncontinued to pay both common and preferred    \ndividends. We also expect to continue         \nrepurchasing our common stock in the second   \nquarter of 2021, at close to the levels of the\nfirst quarter of 2021 (excluding repurchases  \nthat offset equity-based compensation), while \ncomplying with these capital restrictions. In \naddition, we will continue deploying capital  \nto our businesses where returns are accretive.\nGS Bank USA has its own capital planning      \nprocess, but is not required to submit its    \nannual stress test results to the FRB in 2021.\nBased on growth in GS Bank USA\u2019s average      \nbalance sheet, it will be required to submit  \nits annual stress test results in 2022. GSI,  \nGSIB and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE)  \nalso have their own capital planning and      \nstress testing process, which incorporates    \ninternally designed stress tests developed in \naccordance with the guidelines of their       \nrespective regulators. Contingency Capital    \nPlan. As part of our comprehensive capital    \nmanagement policy, we maintain a contingency  \ncapital plan. Our contingency capital plan    \nprovides a framework for analyzing and        \nresponding to a perceived or actual capital   \ndeficiency, including, but not limited to,    \nidentification of drivers of a capital        \ndeficiency, as well as mitigants and potential\nactions. It outlines the appropriate          \ncommunication procedures to follow during a   \ncrisis period, including internal             \ndissemination of information, as well as      \ntimely communication with external            \nstakeholders.                                 \n                                             \n  119    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                             \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Capital  \nAttribution. We assess each of our businesses\u2019\ncapital usage based on our internal assessment\nof risks, which incorporates an attribution of\nour relevant regulatory capital requirements. \nThese regulatory capital requirements are     \nallocated using our attributed equity         \nframework, which takes into consideration our \nmost binding capital constraints. Our most    \nbinding capital constraint is based on the    \nresults of the FRB\u2019s annual stress test, which\nincludes the Standardized risk-based capital  \nand leverage ratios. Effective on January 1,  \n2021, we adjusted the attributed equity       \nframework in line with the impact of the SCB  \nrule and our SCB of 6.6%, which became        \neffective on October 1, 2020 under the        \nStandardized approach. The adjusted attributed\nequity framework places greater emphasis on   \nactivities that generate significant stress   \nlosses and higher Standardized risk weights.  \nAs a result of this adjustment, relative to   \nthe allocation as of December 2020, the       \nallocation of attributed equity among our     \nsegments at the start of this year changed as \nfollows: attributed equity increased by       \napproximately $3.7 billion for Asset          \nManagement and approximately $0.7 billion for \nConsumer & Wealth Management, while attributed\nequity decreased by approximately $2.3 billion\nfor Global Markets and approximately $2.1     \nbillion for Investment Banking. See \u201cSegment  \nAssets and Operating Results \u2014 Segment        \nOperating Results\u201d for information about our  \naverage quarterly attributed equity by        \nsegment. Share Repurchase Program. We use our \nshare repurchase program to help maintain the \nappropriate level of common equity. The       \nrepurchase program is effected primarily      \nthrough regular open-market purchases (which  \nmay include repurchase plans designed to      \ncomply with Rule 10b5-1and accelerated share  \nrepurchases), the amounts and timing of which \nare determined primarily by our current and   \nprojected capital position and our capital    \nplan submitted to the FRB as part of CCAR. The\namounts and timing of the repurchases may also\nbe influenced by general market conditions and\nthe prevailing price and trading volumes of   \nour common stock. As of March 2021, the       \nremaining share authorization under our       \nexisting repurchase program was 41.0 million  \nshares. See \u201cUnregistered Sales of Equity     \nSecurities and Use of Proceeds\u201d in Part II,   \nItem 2 of this Form 10-Qand Note 19 to the    \nconsolidated financial statements for further \ninformation about our share repurchase        \nprogram, and see above for information about  \nour capital planning and stress testing       \nprocess. Resolution Capital Models. In        \nconnection with our resolution planning       \nefforts, we have established a Resolution     \nCapital Adequacy and Positioning framework,   \nwhich is designed to ensure that our major    \nsubsidiaries (GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs & Co.\nLLC (GS&Co.), GSI, GSIB, Goldman Sachs Japan  \nCo., Ltd. (GSJCL), Goldman Sachs Asset        \nManagement, L.P., Goldman Sachs Asset         \nManagement International and GSBE) have access\nto sufficient loss-absorbing capacity (in the \nform of equity, subordinated debt and         \nunsecured senior debt) so that they are able  \nto wind-down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy\nfiling in accordance with our preferred       \nresolution strategy. In addition, we have     \nestablished a triggers and alerts framework,  \nwhich is designed to provide the Board of     \nDirectors of Group Inc. (Board) with          \ninformation needed to make an informed        \ndecision on whether and when to commence      \nbankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc. Rating  \nAgency Guidelines The credit rating agencies  \nassign credit ratings to the obligations of   \nGroup Inc., which directly issues or          \nguarantees substantially all of our senior    \nunsecured debt obligations. GS&Co. and GSI    \nhave been assigned long- and short-term issuer\nratings by certain credit rating agencies. GS \nBank USA, GSIB and GSBE have also been        \nassigned long- and short-term issuer ratings, \nas well as ratings on their long- and short-  \nterm bank deposits. In addition, credit rating\nagencies have assigned ratings to debt        \nobligations of certain other subsidiaries of  \nGroup Inc. The level and composition of our   \nequity capital are among the many factors     \nconsidered in determining our credit ratings. \nEach agency has its own definition of eligible\ncapital and methodology for evaluating capital\nadequacy, and assessments are generally based \non a combination of factors rather than a     \nsingle calculation.

The impact of this temporary    \n       amendment was an increase to (i)\u00a0the   \n       TLAC to leverage exposure ratio of     \n       2.2\u00a0percentage points for the three    \n       months ended March\u00a02021 and 2.4\u00a0       \n       percentage points for the three        \n       months ended December\u00a02020, and (ii)\u00a0  \n       the external long-term debt to         \n       leverage exposure ratio of 1.2\u00a0        \n       percentage points for the three        \n       months ended March\u00a02021 and 1.3\u00a0       \n       percentage points for the three        \n  \u2022    months ended December\u00a02020.            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nSee \u201cBusiness \u2014                               \nRegulation\u201d in Part I,                        \nItem 1 of the 2020 Form                       \n10-Kfor further                               \ninformation about TLAC.                       \nSubsidiary Capital                            \nRequirements Many of                          \nour subsidiaries,                             \nincluding our bank and                        \nbroker-dealer                                 \nsubsidiaries, are                             \nsubject to separate                           \nregulation and capital                        \nrequirements of the                           \njurisdictions in which                        \nthey operate.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis The IBOR \nFallbacks Protocol, which became effective in \nJanuary 2021, provides derivatives market     \nparticipants with new fallbacks for legacy and\nnew derivatives contracts. Both counterparties\nwill have to adhere to the Fallbacks Protocol \nor engage in bilateral amendments for the     \nterms to be effective for derivative          \ncontracts. We have adhered to the Fallbacks   \nProtocol for our eligible derivative          \ncontracts. The International Swaps and        \nDerivatives Association (ISDA) confirmed that \nthe FCA\u2019s formal announcement in March 2021   \nfixed the spread adjustment for all LIBOR     \nrates and that fallbacks will automatically   \noccur for outstanding derivatives contracts   \nthat incorporate the relevant terms. We have a\nprogram in place that focuses on achieving an \norderly transition from IBORs to alternative  \nrisk-free reference rates for us and our      \nclients, and continue to make progress on our \ntransition program. As part of this           \ntransition, we continue to actively engage    \nwith our regulators and clients, as well as   \nparticipate in central bank and sector working\ngroups. We have issued debt and deposits      \nlinked to SOFR and Sterling Overnight Index   \nAverage (SONIA) and executed SOFR- and SONIA- \nbased derivative contracts to make markets and\nfacilitate client activities. Where possible, \nwe continue to execute transactions in the    \nmarket to reduce our LIBOR exposures arising  \nfrom hedges to our fixed-rate debt issuances  \nand replace with alternative reference rate   \nexposures. See \u201cRegulatory and Other Matters \u2013\nOther Matters\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the 2020 \nForm 10-Kfor further information about our    \ntransition program. Impact of                 \nCOVID-19Pandemic. While the availability of   \nvaccines has raised hopes about an end to the \nCOVID-19pandemic, the pandemic\u2019s trajectory   \nwill depend on the speed and scale of vaccine \ndistribution globally and the extent to which \nefforts to curtail infections are hampered by \nnew surges caused by variants of the virus.   \nEntering the second quarter of 2021, the      \nsituation has remained in flux globally, as   \nsome countries have encountered a significant \nincrease in the number of new cases. We have  \ncontinued to successfully execute on our      \nBusiness Continuity Planning (BCP) strategy   \nsince initially activating it in the first    \nquarter of 2020 in response to the emergence  \nof the COVID-19pandemic. Our priority has been\nto safeguard our employees and to seek to     \nensure continuity of business operations on   \nbehalf of our clients. Our business continuity\nresponse to the COVID-19pandemic is managed by\na central team, which is led by our chief     \nadministrative officer and chief medical      \nofficer, and includes senior management within\nRisk and the chief operating officers across  \nall regions and businesses. The vast majority \nof our employees continue to work remotely;   \nhowever, a growing number of people are       \nreturning to our offices in many of our       \nlocations and we expect this trend to         \naccelerate as vaccination programs around the \nworld increase. To minimize health risks to   \nemployees working in our offices, we have     \nimplemented on-sitetesting and other          \nprotocols, such as controls around building   \naccess, strict physical distancing measures   \nand enhanced cleaning regimes, and we are     \nvigilant in monitoring the local safety       \nguidelines in each city in which we operate.  \nOur systems and infrastructure have been      \nrobust throughout the COVID-19pandemic,       \nenabling us to conduct our activities without \ndisruption. We continue to maintain regular   \nand active communication among our senior     \nmanagement, the rest of our employees and the \nBoard, and our decision-making processes have \nremained disciplined and rigorous throughout  \nthe pandemic. Since the beginning of the      \nCOVID-19pandemic, our Management Committee and\nother senior leaders have met regularly and   \nour executive officers have provided regular  \nand enhanced communications to promote        \nconnectivity with our clients and employees   \nworldwide. In addition, as part of our vendor \nmanagement processes, we have ongoing         \ndialogues with third-party service providers, \nwhich are intended to ensure that they        \ncontinue to meet our criteria for business    \ncontinuity.                                   \n                                             \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    124  \n                                             \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis We       \nmaintained a strong level of liquidity during \nthe first quarter of 2021, as our GCLA        \naveraged $299 billion. We have continued to   \naccess our traditional funding sources in the \nnormal course and service our debt and other  \nobligations on a timely basis. Our unsecured  \nlong-term borrowings increased by $6 billion  \nduring the first quarter of 2021, driven by   \nthe issuance of $20 billion of our benchmark  \ndebt to support the growth in our total       \nassets. We expect that during 2021 our        \nbenchmark debt issuances will be higher than  \nmaturities and redemptions. Our CET1 capital  \nratio under the Standardized approach was     \n14.3% as of March 2021, a decrease of 40 basis\npoints compared with December 2020, as we     \nremained committed to meeting the needs of our\nclients, while also being prudent in managing \nour capital. During the first quarter of 2021,\nwe resumed repurchases of our common stock, as\nthe FRB modified the restrictions on          \nrepurchase activity that it had placed on     \nlarge BHC\u2019s for most of 2020. See \u201cBalance    \nSheet and Funding Sources,\u201d \u201cEquity Capital   \nManagement and Regulatory Capital\u201d and        \n\u201cLiquidity Risk Management\u201d for further       \ninformation. As a result of the               \nCOVID-19pandemic, we have had to apply a      \ngreater degree of judgment in making certain  \naccounting estimates and assumptions. The     \nprocess of estimating the allowance for credit\nlosses is inherently judgmental in nature,    \ngiven that it involves forecasts of future    \neconomic conditions. The course of the        \npandemic is still unpredictable, which creates\nuncertainty regarding the pace at which the   \neconomic recovery will progress and how robust\nit will be. The uncertainty regarding the     \npattern of economic recovery has made the     \nprocess for estimating the allowance for      \ncredit losses more challenging, as it has     \nresulted in greater subjectivity in our       \nforecasts of future economic conditions. This \nuncertainty also impacts the estimation of the\nfair value for less liquid financial          \ninstruments that lack price transparency,     \nwhere valuation involves judgment regarding   \nestimated future cash flows or other          \nsignificant unobservable inputs. See Note 9 to\nthe consolidated financial statements for     \nfurther information about our allowance for   \ncredit losses and Note 4 to the consolidated  \nfinancial statements for further information  \nabout fair value measurements. In the first   \nquarter of 2021, financial markets were       \ngenerally characterized by higher confidence  \nin the prospect of rapid and sustained        \neconomic growth, a sentiment that was largely \ndriven by the anticipated impact of mass      \ndistribution of vaccines, additional          \ngovernment support and continued business     \nreopenings. Client activity in the quarter was\nstrong, and we remained committed to serving  \nthe needs of clients by facilitating risk     \nmanagement, providing financing and deploying \nour balance sheet. Our average daily Value-at-\nRisk(VaR) for the first quarter of 2021 was   \n$89 million, $5 million higher than the fourth\nquarter of 2020. We have maintained our       \nproactive approach to managing market risk    \nlevels, which entails ongoing review and      \nmonitoring of exposures and focusing on ways  \nto mitigate risk. With respect to credit risk,\nthe improving macroeconomic environment, along\nwith various government support programs, have\nled to a stabilization of most industries that\nencountered extreme disruptions from the      \nCOVID-19pandemic. However, these industries,  \nwhich include gaming and lodging and airlines,\nremain at risk and we continue to closely     \nmonitor our exposures to them. Throughout this\ncrisis, we have remained highly focused on    \nmonitoring credit exposures in general and on \nthe management of margin calls and disputes.  \nOur risk positions remained balanced,         \ncontrolled and adequately provisioned for,    \nboth in terms of counterparty risk and sector \nexposure. See \u201cMarket Risk Management\u201d and    \n\u201cCredit Risk Management\u201d for further          \ninformation. To support clients in need of    \nrelief from the financial strain caused by the\nCOVID-19pandemic, we granted forbearance to   \ncertain corporate and other borrowers, and    \nprovided consumers with the ability to defer  \npayments on installment and credit card loans \nwithout incurring interest charges and to     \naccess certificates of deposit early without  \nincurring a penalty. As of March 2021, the    \ntotal amount of loans for which such          \nforbearance or payment deferrals were still in\neffect was less than 1%.                      \n                                             \n  125    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                             \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Overview and        \nStructure of Risk Management Overview We      \nbelieve that effective risk management is     \ncritical to our success. Accordingly, we have \nestablished an enterprise risk management     \nframework that employs a comprehensive,       \nintegrated approach to risk management, and is\ndesigned to enable comprehensive risk         \nmanagement processes through which we         \nidentify, assess, monitor and manage the risks\nwe assume in conducting our activities. Our   \nrisk management structure is built around     \nthree core components: governance, processes  \nand people. Governance. Risk management       \ngovernance starts with the Board, which both  \ndirectly and through its committees, including\nits Risk Committee, oversees our risk         \nmanagement policies and practices implemented \nthrough the enterprise risk management        \nframework. The Board is also responsible for  \nthe annual review and approval of our risk    \nappetite statement. The risk appetite         \nstatement describes the levels and types of   \nrisk we are willing to accept or to avoid, in \norder to achieve our objectives included in   \nour strategic business plan, while remaining  \nin compliance with regulatory requirements.   \nThe Board reviews our strategic business plan \nand is ultimately responsible for overseeing  \nand providing direction about our strategy and\nrisk appetite.                                \n                                             \n  127    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                             \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

Although we have   \n  \u2022    access to various central bank         \n       funding programs, we do not assume     \n       reliance on additional sources of      \n       funding in a liquidity crisis; and     \n                                              \n                                              \n       A combination of contractual           \n       outflows, such as upcoming maturities  \n       of unsecured debt, and contingent      \n       outflows, including, but not limited   \n       to, the withdrawal of customer credit  \n       balances in our prime brokerage        \n  \u2022    business, increase in variation        \n       margin requirements due to adverse     \n       changes in the value of our            \n       exchange-traded                        \n       andOTC-clearedderivatives, and         \n       withdrawals of deposits that have no   \n       contractual maturity.                  \n                                              \nIntraday Liquidity Model. Our Intraday        \nLiquidity Model measures our intraday         \nliquidity needs using a scenario analysis     \ncharacterized by the same qualitative elements\nas our Modeled Liquidity Outflow. The model   \nassesses the risk of increased intraday       \nliquidity requirements during a scenario where\naccess to sources of intraday liquidity may   \nbecome constrained. Long-Term Stress Testing. \nWe utilize longer-term stress tests to take a \nforward view on our liquidity position through\nprolonged stress periods in which we          \nexperience a severe liquidity stress and      \nrecover in an environment that continues to be\nchallenging. We are focused on ensuring       \nconservative asset-liability management to    \nprepare for a prolonged period of potential   \nstress, seeking to maintain a diversified     \nfunding profile with an appropriate tenor,    \ntaking into consideration the characteristics \nand liquidity profile of our assets.          \nResolution Liquidity Models. In connection    \nwith our resolution planning efforts, we have \nestablished our Resolution Liquidity Adequacy \nand Positioning framework, which estimates    \nliquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a\nstressed environment. The liquidity needs are \nmeasured using our Modeled Liquidity Outflow  \nassumptions and include certain additional    \ninter-affiliate exposures. We have also       \nestablished our Resolution Liquidity Execution\nNeed framework, which measures the liquidity  \nneeds of our major subsidiaries to stabilize  \nand wind-down following a Group Inc.          \nbankruptcy filing in accordance with our      \npreferred resolution strategy. In addition, we\nhave established a triggers and alerts        \nframework, which is designed to provide the   \nBoard with information needed to make an      \ninformed decision on whether and when to      \ncommence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.\nLimits We use liquidity risk limits at various\nlevels and across liquidity risk types to     \nmanage the size of our liquidity exposures.   \nLimits are measured relative to acceptable    \nlevels of risk given our liquidity risk       \ntolerance. See \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk\nManagement\u201d for information about the limit   \napproval process. Limits are monitored by     \nTreasury and Liquidity Risk. Liquidity Risk is\nresponsible for identifying and escalating to \nsenior management and/or the appropriate risk \ncommittee, on a timely basis, instances where \nlimits have been exceeded.                    \n                                             \n  135    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                             \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

VaR    \nexcludes the impact of changes in counterparty\ncredit spreads, our own credit spreads and    \nunsecured funding spreads on derivatives, as  \nwell as changes in our own credit spreads     \n(debt valuation adjustment) on financial      \nliabilities for which the fair value option   \nwas elected. The estimated sensitivity to a   \none basis point increase in credit spreads    \n(counterparty and our own) and unsecured      \nfunding spreads on derivatives (including     \nhedges) was a loss of $2 million as of March  \n2021 and $3 million as of December 2020. In   \naddition, the estimated sensitivity to a one  \nbasis point increase in our own credit spreads\non financial liabilities for which the fair   \nvalue option was elected was a gain of $28    \nmillion as of March 2021 and $22 million as of\nDecember 2020. However, the actual net impact \nof a change in our own credit spreads is also \naffected by the liquidity, duration and       \nconvexity (as the sensitivity is not linear to\nchanges in yields) of those financial         \nliabilities for which the fair value option   \nwas elected, as well as the relative          \nperformance of any hedges undertaken. Interest\nRate Sensitivity. Loans accounted for at      \namortized cost were $104.60 billion as of     \nMarch 2021 and $99.69 billion as of December  \n2020, substantially all of which had floating \ninterest rates. The estimated sensitivity to a\n100 basis point increase in interest rates on \nsuch loans was $808 million as of March 2021  \nand $737 million as of December 2020 of       \nadditional interest income over a twelve-month\nperiod, which does not take into account the  \npotential impact of an increase in costs to   \nfund such loans.

Risk Measures We measure our credit   \nrisk based on the potential loss in the event \nof non-paymentby a counterparty using current \nand potential exposure. For derivatives and   \nsecurities financing transactions, current    \nexposure represents the amount presently owed \nto us after taking into account applicable    \nnetting and collateral arrangements, while    \npotential exposure represents our estimate of \nthe future exposure that could arise over the \nlife of a transaction based on market         \nmovements within a specified confidence level.\nPotential exposure also takes into account    \nnetting and collateral arrangements. For loans\nand lending commitments, the primary measure  \nis a function of the notional amount of the   \nposition. Stress Tests We conduct regular     \nstress tests to calculate the credit          \nexposures, including potential concentrations \nthat would result from applying shocks to     \ncounterparty credit ratings or credit risk    \nfactors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates,\nequity prices). These shocks cover a wide     \nrange of moderate and more extreme market     \nmovements, including shocks to multiple risk  \nfactors, consistent with the occurrence of a  \nsevere market or economic event. In the case  \nof sovereign default, we estimate the direct  \nimpact of the default on our sovereign credit \nexposures, changes to our credit exposures    \narising from potential market moves in        \nresponse to the default, and the impact of    \ncredit market deterioration on corporate      \nborrowers and counterparties that may result  \nfrom the sovereign default. Unlike potential  \nexposure, which is calculated within a        \nspecified confidence level, stress testing    \ndoes not generally assume a probability of    \nthese events occurring. We also perform       \nfirmwide stress tests. See \u201cOverview and      \nStructure of Risk Management\u201d for information \nabout firmwide stress tests. To supplement    \nthese regular stress tests, as described      \nabove, we also conduct tailored stress tests  \non an ad hoc basis in response to specific    \nmarket events that we deem significant. We    \nalso utilize these stress tests to estimate   \nthe indirect impact of certain hypothetical   \nevents on our country exposures, such as the  \nimpact of credit market deterioration on      \ncorporate borrowers and counterparties along  \nwith the shocks to the risk factors described \nabove. The parameters of these shocks vary    \nbased on the scenario reflected in each stress\ntest. We review estimated losses produced by  \nthe stress tests in order to understand their \nmagnitude, highlight potential loss           \nconcentrations, and assess and mitigate our   \nexposures where necessary. Limits We use      \ncredit risk limits at various levels, as well \nas underwriting standards to manage the size  \nand nature of our credit exposures. Limits for\nindustries and countries are based on our risk\nappetite and are designed to allow for regular\nmonitoring, review, escalation and management \nof credit risk concentrations. See \u201cOverview  \nand Structure of Risk Management\u201d for         \ninformation about the limit approval process. \nCredit Risk is responsible for monitoring     \nthese limits, and identifying and escalating  \nto senior management and/or the appropriate   \nrisk committee, on a timely basis, instances  \nwhere limits have been exceeded. Risk         \nMitigants To reduce our credit exposures on   \nderivatives and securities financing          \ntransactions, we may enter into netting       \nagreements with counterparties that permit us \nto offset receivables and payables with such  \ncounterparties. We may also reduce credit risk\nwith counterparties by entering into          \nagreements that enable us to obtain collateral\nfrom them on an upfront or contingent basis   \nand/or to terminate transactions if the       \ncounterparty\u2019s credit rating falls below a    \nspecified level. We monitor the fair value of \nthe collateral to ensure that our credit      \nexposures are appropriately collateralized. We\nseek to minimize exposures where there is a   \nsignificant positive correlation between the  \ncreditworthiness of our counterparties and the\nmarket value of collateral we receive. For    \nloans and lending commitments, depending on   \nthe credit quality of the borrower and other  \ncharacteristics of the transaction, we employ \na variety of potential risk mitigants. Risk   \nmitigants include collateral provisions,      \nguarantees, covenants, structural seniority of\nthe bank loan claims and, for certain lending \ncommitments, provisions in the legal          \ndocumentation that allow us to adjust loan    \namounts, pricing, structure and other terms as\nmarket conditions change. The type and        \nstructure of risk mitigants employed can      \nsignificantly influence the degree of credit  \nrisk involved in a loan or lending commitment.\nWhen we do not have sufficient visibility into\na counterparty\u2019s financial strength or when we\nbelieve a counterparty requires support from  \nits parent, we may obtain third-party         \nguarantees of the counterparty\u2019s obligations. \nWe may also mitigate our credit risk using    \ncredit derivatives or participation           \nagreements.                                   \n                                             \n  Goldman\u00a0Sachs March\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-Q    144  \n                                             \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

High external funding needs and    \nfiscal policy changes have led to significant \ndepreciation of the Turkish Lira prompting    \nconcerns about foreign exchange reserves and  \neconomic instability. As of March 2021, our   \ntotal credit exposure to Turkey was $2.42     \nbillion, which was with non-                  \nsovereigncounterparties or borrowers. Such    \nexposure consisted of $1.46 billion related to\nOTC derivatives, $290 million related to loans\nand lending commitments and $668 million      \nrelated to secured receivables. After taking  \ninto consideration the benefit of hedges and  \nTurkish corporate and sovereign collateral,   \nand other risk mitigants provided by Turkish  \ncounterparties, our net credit exposure was   \n$551 million. In addition, our total market   \nexposure to Turkey as of March 2021 was $228  \nmillion, primarily with non-sovereignissuers  \nor underliers. Such exposure consisted of $319\nmillion related to debt, $(89) million related\nto credit derivatives and $(2) million related\nto equities. Liquidity pressures prompted the \nArgentine government to default and           \nrestructure local and foreign obligations in  \n2020. Economic challenges persist and the     \ncountry still needs to secure new financial   \nterms with the IMF. As of March 2021, our     \ntotal credit exposure to Argentina was $147   \nmillion, which was with non-                  \nsovereigncounterparties or borrowers, and was \nprimarily related to loans and lending        \ncommitments. Our total market exposure to     \nArgentina as of March 2021 was not material.  \nThe restructuring of Lebanon\u2019s sovereign debt \nand sharp currency depreciation have led to   \nconcerns about its financial and political    \nstability. As of March 2021, our total credit \nand market exposure for Lebanon was not       \nmaterial. Zambia\u2019s sovereign debt default and \nongoing liquidity pressures aggravated by the \nCOVID-19pandemic have led to concerns about   \nZambia\u2019s financial stability. As of March     \n2021, our total credit and market exposure for\nZambia was not material. Venezuela has delayed\npayments on its sovereign debt and its        \npolitical situation remains unclear. As of    \nMarch 2021, our total credit and market       \nexposure for Venezuela was not material. We   \nhave a comprehensive framework to monitor,    \nmeasure and assess our country exposures and  \nto determine our risk appetite. We determine  \nthe country of risk by the location of the    \ncounterparty, issuer or underlier\u2019s assets,   \nwhere they generate revenue, the country in   \nwhich they are headquartered, the jurisdiction\nwhere a claim against them could be enforced, \nand/or the government whose policies affect   \ntheir ability to repay their obligations. We  \nmonitor our credit exposure to a specific     \ncountry both at the individual counterparty   \nlevel, as well as at the aggregate country    \nlevel.

As of March 2021,\nour credit exposure to gaming and lodging     \ncompanies (including hotel owners and         \noperators) related to loans and lending       \ncommitments was $2.27 billion ($669 million of\nloans and $1.60 billion of lending            \ncommitments). Such exposure included $2.23    \nbillion of exposure to non-investment-        \ngradecounterparties ($669 million related to  \nloans and $1.56 billion related to lending    \ncommitments), of which 66% was secured. In    \naddition, we extend loans that are secured by \nhotel properties. As of March 2021, our       \nexposure related to such loans and lending    \ncommitments was $1.35 billion and was to non- \ninvestment-gradecounterparties. In addition,  \nwe have exposure to our clients in the gaming \nand lodging industry arising from derivatives.\nAs of March 2021, our credit exposure related \nto derivatives and receivables with gaming and\nlodging companies was $188 million, which was \nwith non-investment-gradecounterparties. After\ntaking into consideration the benefit of $80  \nmillion of hedges, our net credit exposure was\n$2.38 billion. As of March 2021, our market   \nexposure related to gaming and lodging        \ncompanies was $(29) million, which was        \nprimarily to non-investment-gradeissuers or   \nunderliers. Such exposure consisted of $(147) \nmillion related to debt, $(123) million       \nrelated to credit derivatives and $241 million\nrelated to equities. Concerns surrounding the \nCOVID-19pandemic have resulted in a sharp     \ndecline in travel which has significantly     \nimpacted the airline industry. As of March    \n2021, our credit exposure to airline companies\nrelated to loans and lending commitments was  \n$1.55 billion ($724 million of loans and $830 \nmillion of lending commitments) to non-       \ninvestment-gradecounterparties, of which 91%  \nwas secured. In addition, we have exposure to \nour clients in the airline industry arising   \nfrom derivatives. As of March 2021, our credit\nexposure related to derivatives and           \nreceivables with airline companies was $88    \nmillion ($40 million with investment-grade    \ncounterparties and $48 million with non-      \ninvestment-gradecounterparties). After taking \ninto consideration the benefit of $211 million\nof hedges, our net credit exposure was $1.43  \nbillion. As of March 2021, our market exposure\nrelated to airline companies was $(13)        \nmillion, which was substantially all to non-  \ninvestment-gradeissuers or underliers. Such   \nexposure consisted of $238 million related to \ndebt, $(213) million related to credit        \nderivatives and $(38) million related to      \nequities.                                     \n                                             \n  151    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                             \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Types of \nOperational Risks Increased reliance on       \ntechnology and third-party relationships has  \nresulted in increased operational risks, such \nas information and cyber security risk, third-\nparty risk and business resilience risk. We   \nmanage those risks as follows: Information and\nCyber Security Risk. Information and cyber    \nsecurity risk is the risk of compromising the \nconfidentiality, integrity or availability of \nour data and systems, leading to an adverse   \nimpact to us, our reputation, our clients     \nand/or the broader financial system. We seek  \nto minimize the occurrence and impact of      \nunauthorized access, disruption or use of     \ninformation and/or information systems. We    \ndeploy and operate preventive and detective   \ncontrols and processes to mitigate emerging   \nand evolving information security and cyber   \nsecurity threats, including monitoring our    \nnetwork for known vulnerabilities and signs of\nunauthorized attempts to access our data and  \nsystems. There is increased information risk  \nthrough diversification of our data across    \nexternal service providers, including use of a\nvariety of cloud-provided or -hosted services \nand applications. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part  \nI, Item 1A of the 2020 Form 10-Kfor further   \ninformation about information and cyber       \nsecurity risk. Third-Party Risk. Third-party  \nrisk, including vendor risk, is the risk of an\nadverse impact due to reliance on third       \nparties performing services or activities on  \nour behalf. These risks may include legal,    \nregulatory, information security,             \nreputational, operational or any other risks  \ninherent in engaging a third party. We        \nidentify, manage and report key third-party   \nrisks and conduct due diligence across        \nmultiple risk domains, including information  \nsecurity and cyber security, resilience and   \nadditional third-party dependencies. The      \nThird-Party Risk Program monitors, reviews and\nreassesses third-party risks on an ongoing    \nbasis. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A  \nof the 2020 Form 10-Kfor further information  \nabout third-party risk. Business Resilience   \nRisk. Business resilience risk is the risk of \ndisruption to our critical processes. We      \nmonitor threats and assess risks and seek to  \nensure our state of readiness in the event of \na significant operational disruption to the   \nnormal operations of our critical functions or\ntheir dependencies, such as critical          \nfacilities, systems, third parties, data      \nand/or personnel. We approach BCP through the \nlens of business and operational resilience.  \nThe resilience framework defines the          \nfundamental principles for BCP and crisis     \nmanagement to ensure that critical functions  \ncan continue to operate in the event of a     \ndisruption. The business continuity program is\ncomprehensive, consistent firmwide and up-to- \ndate,incorporating new information, techniques\nand technologies as and when they become      \navailable, and our resilience recovery plans  \nincorporate and test specific and measurable  \nrecovery time objectives in accordance with   \nlocal market best practices and regulatory    \nrequirements, and under specific scenarios.   \nSee \u201cRegulatory and Other Matters \u2014 Other     \nMatters\u201d for information about the impact of  \nthe COVID-19pandemic. See \u201cBusiness \u2014 Business\nContinuity and Information Security\u201d in Part  \nI, Item 1 of the 2020 Form 10-Kfor further    \ninformation about business continuity. Model  \nRisk Management Overview Model risk is the    \npotential for adverse consequences from       \ndecisions made based on model outputs that may\nbe incorrect or used inappropriately. We rely \non quantitative models across our business    \nactivities primarily to value certain         \nfinancial assets and liabilities, to monitor  \nand manage our risk, and to measure and       \nmonitor our regulatory capital. Model Risk,   \nwhich is independent of our revenue-producing \nunits, model developers, model owners and     \nmodel users, and reports to our chief risk    \nofficer, has primary responsibility for       \nassessing, monitoring and managing our model  \nrisk through firmwide oversight across our    \nglobal businesses, and provides periodic      \nupdates to senior management, risk committees \nand the Risk Committee of the Board. Our model\nrisk management framework is managed through a\ngovernance structure and risk management      \ncontrols, which encompass standards designed  \nto ensure we maintain a comprehensive model   \ninventory, including risk assessment and      \nclassification, sound model development       \npractices, independent review and model-      \nspecific usage controls. The Firmwide Model   \nRisk Control Committee oversees our model risk\nmanagement framework.                         \n                                             \n  153    Goldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0Form\u00a010-Q  \n                                             \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS                             \nGROUP, INC.
