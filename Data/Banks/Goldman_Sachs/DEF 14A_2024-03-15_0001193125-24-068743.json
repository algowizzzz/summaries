These           \n  statements are not historical facts, but    \n  instead represent only our beliefs          \n  regarding future events, many of which, by  \n  their nature, are inherently uncertain and  \n  outside of our control. Forward-looking     \n  statements include, without limitation,     \n  statements about our businesses, such as    \n  trends in or growth opportunities for such  \n  businesses, expense savings initiatives,    \n  interest expense savings, funding           \n  strategies and durability of earnings as    \n  well as the effectiveness of our            \n  management of our human capital, including  \n  our aspirational diversity goals, and may   \n  relate to, among other things, our future   \n  plans and results, including the narrowing  \n  of our consumer business and our target     \n  ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio and CET1        \n  ratio, and how they can be achieved, and    \n  goals relating to our sustainability        \n  initiatives, among other things. It is      \n  possible that the firm\u2019s actual results     \n  and financial condition may differ,         \n  possibly materially, from the anticipated   \n  results, financial condition and            \n  incremental revenues and savings, funding   \n  strategies or increased durability in       \n  earnings, among other things, indicated in  \n  these forward-looking statements.           \n  Statements about Goldman Sachs\u2019             \n  businesses, savings and other initiatives   \n  are subject to the risk that our            \n  businesses may be unable to generate        \n  additional incremental revenues or reduce   \n  expenses consistent with current            \n  expectations.

Despite a challenging            \nenvironment, 2023 was a year of execution for \nGoldman Sachs. In addition to narrowing our   \nstrategic focus, we strengthened our core     \nbusinesses. As you can read about in more     \ndetail in the 2023 letter to shareholders in  \nour Annual Report, because of the decisions we\nmade, I believe the firm is well positioned   \nfor 2024.

Over the course\nof a decade, Bayo has exemplified excellence  \nin his role as our Lead Director. His         \ncommitment, integrity, intelligence and       \ndedication to his fellow Board members has    \nleft an indelible mark on all of us, and above\nall, Bayo has shown unwavering commitment to  \nstewarding the interests of our shareholders. \nBayo\u2019s insightful advice has guided our       \ndecision-making processes and fostered an     \nenvironment of growth and progress. He has    \nalso challenged us, pushing us to strive for a\nbetter level of achievement collectively and  \nto not lose sight of lessons learned. I also  \nwant to take a moment to thank Jessica Uhl,   \nwho will be retiring from the Board at the    \nAnnual Meeting. Jessica has had a great impact\nduring her tenure, with an unwavering focus on\nfinancial and nonfinancial risk management and\ncontrols. She has also provided valued        \nguidance and informed counsel across a wide   \nbreadth of topics. I want to congratulate her \nin particular on her new role as President of \nGE Vernova. On behalf of the entire Board and \nour shareholders, we extend our gratitude to  \nboth Bayo and Jessica for the exceptional     \ncontributions they have each made to our Board\nand our firm. We wish them both every         \nhappiness, fulfillment and success in the     \nfuture. Lastly, I want to congratulate David  \nViniar on his appointment by our independent  \ndirectors as our new Lead Director and I look \nforward to our continued work together. We    \nlook forward to engaging with our shareholders\nat our Annual Meeting. I would like to        \npersonally thank you for your continued       \nsupport of Goldman Sachs as we continue to    \ninvest together in the future of this firm.   \nDavid Solomon Chairman and Chief Executive    \nOfficer                                       \n                                              \n  Our Purpose We                              \n  aspire to be the                            \n  world\u2019s                                     \n  most exceptional       Our Core Values \u00a0    \n  financial              Our purpose comes    \n  institution,           to life through our  \n  united by our          four Core Values:    \n  shared values of                            \n  partnership, client                         \n  service, integrity                          \n  and excellence.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Partne\u2026    Client      Integr\u2026    Excelle\u2026  \n             Service                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual         \n  Meeting of                              ii  \n  Shareholders | Goldman Sachs                \n                                              \n                                              \n  LETTER FROM OUR LEAD DIRECTORLetter from    \n  our Lead DirectorMarch\u00a015, 2024Our          \n  Shareholders,With our 2024 Annual Meeting   \n  approaching, I write to you what will be    \n  my last letter as your Lead Director,       \n  reflecting upon last year and sharing with  \n  you some of the highlights of the work of   \n  our Board and Committees.Our BoardAs        \n  announced in January 2024, I will be        \n  retiring from the Board at the 2024 Annual  \n  Meeting. First and foremost, I want to say  \n  that it has been my distinct honor and      \n  privilege to have served alongside the      \n  distinguished group of directors on our     \n  Board since 2012 and to have served this    \n  venerable firm and its shareholders as      \n  your Lead Director for the past decade. I   \n  am particularly grateful for the many       \n  opportunities I have had to engage with     \n  you, our shareholders. My retirement is a   \n  bittersweet event for me personally. I      \n  have full confidence in our Board and in    \n  the firm\u2019s forward strategy and am excited  \n  about the future of the firm. Please know   \n  that I will be cheering enthusiastically    \n  from the sidelines and expect to be a       \n  client of the firm.I am pleased to pass     \n  the torch to David Viniar, who will assume  \n  the roles of Lead Director and Chair of     \n  the Governance Committee on April 24.       \n  David, who joined the Board in January      \n  2013, has exhibited steadfast dedication    \n  to the Board and its oversight obligations  \n  \u2014 including, where necessary, the duty to   \n  challenge management \u2014 and has              \n  unparalleled knowledge about our business   \n  and industry that I know will serve him,    \n  our Board and our firm well as he takes on  \n  these new roles.As you will see detailed    \n  in the Proxy Statement, there have been     \n  some other changes to the Board over the    \n  past year, including the July 2023          \n  appointment of Thomas Montag to our Board.  \n  Tom brings to the Board extensive           \n  financial services experience and deep      \n  risk acumen, and we have already benefited  \n  from his wise counsel across a wide range   \n  of topics. As previously announced, Tom     \n  will assume the role of Chair of our Risk   \n  Committee, succeeding David Viniar, and     \n  the Board looks forward to his informed     \n  perspective as he takes on this new         \n  leadership role. In addition, as            \n  previously reported to you, in April 2023,  \n  Kimberley Harris became the Chair of our    \n  Compensation Committee. Kim has done an     \n  incredible job over the past year in this   \n  role, drawing upon her cross-disciplinary   \n  perspective and public policy and           \n  regulatory expertise garnered from her      \n  range of experiences acting as a trusted    \n  advisor to senior leaders in both the       \n  public and private sectors.I also want to   \n  recognize Jessica Uhl, who will not be      \n  standing for re-election at the upcoming    \n  Annual Meeting. Jessica has been a          \n  dedicated director over the last several    \n  years, with an astute focus on risk         \n  management and controls and informed        \n  financial acumen. On behalf of our entire   \n  Board, I want to thank Jessica for her      \n  dedicated service and counsel, and wish     \n  her every continued success, including in   \n  her new role as President of GE             \n  Vernova.These changes are reflective of     \n  our Board\u2019s broad and diverse mix of        \n  skills and experiences and a result of our  \n  ongoing reviews of Board composition,       \n  which include regular reviews of director   \n  skill sets, individual director             \n  evaluations,                                \n  robustre-nominationassessments and board    \n  leadership succession planning              \n  considerations.

As was discussed during the          \n  strategic update provided in January 2024,  \n  management\u2019s decisive actions, led by       \n  David Solomon, John Waldron and Denis       \n  Coleman, have provided the firm with a      \n  stronger platform for 2024 and beyond.Our   \n  Board engaged actively with senior          \n  management on these strategic changes and   \n  we support the firm\u2019s clear and simplified  \n  forward strategy. Our obligation to advise  \n  and guide the senior management team on     \n  the development, ongoing refinement and     \n  execution of the firm\u2019s strategy and        \n  growth initiatives will never be off our    \n  agenda, and we will continue to hold        \n  management accountable for providing you    \n  with ongoing transparency about our         \n  strategic path.Proxy\u00a0Statement\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0     \n  2024\u00a0Annual\u00a0Meeting\u00a0of\u00a0Shareholders\u2002|\u2002      \n  Goldman Sachsiii                            \n                                              \nLETTER FROM OUR LEAD DIRECTOR To this end,    \nduring 2023, over the course of 78 Board and  \nCommittee meetings, and significant engagement\nbeyond the boardroom (including over 200      \nengagements by the 2023 Committee Chairs and  \nmyself), directors met with David, John and   \nDenis \u2014 as well as with the broader management\nand control teams and employees across the    \nfirm \u2014 on the key drivers and risks relating  \nto the execution of the narrowed strategic    \nfocus and other important priorities on       \nfirmwide, regional and business levels.

To assess independence, our\nGovernance Committee and our Board review     \ndetailed information regarding our independent\ndirectors or nominees, including employment   \nand public company and not-for-profit         \ndirectorships, as well as information         \nregarding immediate family members and        \naffiliated entities. Through the course of    \nthis review, our Governance Committee and our \nBoard consider relationships between the      \nindependent directors or nominees (and their  \nimmediate family members and affiliated       \nentities) on the one hand, and Goldman Sachs  \nand its affiliates on the other, in accordance\nwith our Director Independence Policy. This   \nincludes a review of revenues to the firm     \nfrom, and payments or donations made by the   \nfirm to, relevant entities affiliated with our\ndirectors or nominees (or their immediate     \nfamily members) as a result of ordinary course\ntransactions or contributions to not-for-     \nprofit organizations.

This Special     \nCommittee met twice in 2023 and reported to   \nthe Board on its activities. Following the    \ncompletion of our obligations pursuant to the \nsettlements, our Board determined, as part of \nits annual Board and Committee evaluation, to \ndissolve the 1MDB Remediation Special         \nCommittee, with oversight to continue as part \nof the Board\u2019s and each Committee\u2019s respective\nmandate. The Board may from time to time      \nutilize additional special purpose committees;\nany such committees will report periodically  \nto the Board on its activities.               \n                                              \n  Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual         \n  Meeting of                              19  \n  Shareholders | Goldman Sachs                \n                                              \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\u2014STRUCTURE OF OUR BOARD   \nAND GOVERNANCE PRACTICES BOARD AND COMMITTEE  \nEVALUATIONS                                   \n                                   \n  Board and Committee Evaluations  \n                                   \nBoard and Committee evaluations play a        \ncritical role in helping to ensure the        \neffective functioning of our Board. It is     \nimportant to take stock of Board, Committee   \nand director performance and to solicit and   \nact upon feedback received from each member of\nour Board. To this end, under the leadership  \nof our Lead Director, our Governance Committee\nevaluates the performance of our Board        \nannually, and each of our Board\u2019s Committees  \nalso conducts an annual self-evaluation. 2023 \nEvaluations: A Multi-Step Process REVIEW OF   \nEVALUATION PROCESS Our Lead Director and      \nGovernance Committee periodically review the  \nevaluation process so that actionable feedback\nis solicited on the operation of our Board and\nits Committees, as well as on director        \nperformance QUESTIONNAIRE Provides director   \nfeedback on an unattributed basis; feedback   \nfrom questionnaire informs one-on-one and     \nclosed session discussions ONE-ON-ONE         \nDISCUSSIONS On a biennial basis (including for\n2023), the Secretary to the Board interviews  \neach director to obtain feedback on director  \nperformance, the results of which are provided\nto our Lead Director.

Conducting regular assessments,     \nrather than having a fixed policy, allows our \nBoard to deliberate the merits of our Board\u2019s \nleadership structure to ensure that the most  \nefficient and appropriate leadership structure\nis in place for our firm\u2019s needs, which may   \nevolve over time. We are committed to         \nindependent leadership on our Board. If at any\ntime the Chair is not an independent director,\nour independent directors will appoint an     \nindependent Lead Director.                    \n                            \n  Key Components of Review  \n                            \n                                              \n          Polic\u2026    Shar\u2026                     \n          &\u00a0        Feed\u2026              Tren\u2026  \n  Cha\u2026    Pract\u2026    &                  &      \n  &       to        Voti\u2026    Firm      Deve\u2026  \n  Lead    Ensure    Resu\u2026    Perfo\u2026    Rega\u2026  \n  Dir\u2026    Strong    Rega\u2026              Lead\u2026  \n  Res\u2026    Indep\u2026    Board              Stru\u2026  \n          Board     Lead\u2026                     \n          Overs\u2026                              \n                                              \nIn December 2023, our Governance Committee    \nconducted its annual review of our Board\u2019s    \nleadership structure. The review considered a \nvariety of factors, including our governance  \npractices and shareholder feedback on our     \nBoard and its leadership structure. In        \naddition, our Governance Committee considered \nfeedback on our Chairman of the Board received\nin connection with the Board evaluation. As a \nresult of this review, our Governance         \nCommittee determined that continuing to have  \nMr. Solomon serve as both Chairman and        \nCEO\u2014working together with a strong independent\nLead Director\u2014is the most effective leadership\nstructure for our Board and our firm at this  \ntime. Ultimately, we believe that our current \nleadership structure, together with strong    \ngovernance practices, creates a productive    \nrelationship between our Board and management,\nincluding strong independent oversight that   \nbenefits our shareholders. We will continue to\nconduct Board leadership assessments annually.\nIf at any time our Governance Committee       \ndetermines it would be appropriate to appoint \nan independent Chair, it will not hesitate to \ndo so.

Discussions  \non corporate governance matters are often part\nof a broader dialogue covering corporate      \nstrategy, business performance, risk oversight\nand other key themes.                         \n                                              \n  ~150                   ~15                  \n  Total Equity and                            \n  Fixed Income           Investor             \n  Investors              Conferences          \n  Engaged Across both    Participated in by   \n  group and 1:1          senior management    \n  engagements with       during 2023          \n  senior management                           \n                                              \n                                              \n          Common Stock Outstanding Engaged    \n  >25%    Lead Director engagement with       \n          shareholders during 2023            \n                                              \n                                              \n  Top 100+       >35%            >65          \n                 Common Stock                 \n                 Outstanding                  \n  Shareholder    Engaged IR      1:1          \n  Outreach       engagement      Investor     \n  Ahead of       with            Meetings     \n  Annual         shareholders    With         \n  Meeting        on ESG          C-Suite      \n                 matters                      \n                 during 2023                  \n                                              \nDuring 2023, engagement with corporate        \ngovernance stakeholders covered a variety of  \ntopics, including board governance, executive \ncompensation and succession planning,         \nstrategic priorities and goals as well as     \nbusiness performance, firm culture and people \nstrategy, financial resource management,      \nregulatory environment and outlook,           \nsustainable finance and climate risk, and risk\nmanagement.                                   \n                                              \n  Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual         \n  Meeting of                              31  \n  Shareholders | Goldman Sachs                \n                                              \nSPOTLIGHT ON SUSTAINABILITY Spotlight on      \nSustainability Our Approach to Sustainability \nSustainability helps guide our work with our  \nclients, including our emphasis on supporting \nour people and our broader strategic          \ndirection.

Our           \ncapabilities and solutions span our core      \nfranchises; for example, within Global Banking\n& Markets, we established the Sustainable     \nBanking Group, a group focused on supporting  \nour corporate clients in reducing their direct\nand indirect carbon emissions. Within Asset & \nWealth Management, teams including Public     \nMarkets Investing, Private Markets Investing, \nExternal Investing, and Private Wealth        \nManagement all have sustainable investing     \ncapabilities, and the Sustainability & Impact \nSolutions team in Asset & Wealth Management   \nalso helps mobilize the full range of         \ninsights, advisory services and investment    \nsolutions across our asset management client  \nsegments. We also seek to identify climate-   \nrelated gaps in the marketplace and address   \nthem by leveraging our existing capabilities  \nand working with clients and strategic        \npartners to develop innovative solutions.

In doing so, we\nset three 2030 sectoral targets: Energy, Power\nand Auto Manufacturing. These sectors reflect \nwhere we see the greatest opportunity to      \nproactively engage with our clients, deploy   \ncapital required for the transition, and      \ninvest in new commercial solutions to support \ntransition to the low-carbon economy. In our  \nDecember 2023 TCFD Report, we provided an     \nupdate on our progress on these targets, and  \nin 2024 we plan to provide another update on  \nthese targets. We will continue to support our\nclients in critical sectors as they deliver on\ntheir climate transition strategies, including\nby providing financing and investing in       \nclimate transition-enabling technology and    \ninfrastructure. As relevant regulations are   \nfinalized, we anticipate providing additional \ndisclosures in 2025 to comply with climate-   \nand other sustainability-related reporting    \nrequirements, including those of the EU       \nCorporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. \n                    \n  Inclusive Growth  \n                    \nTo advance economic opportunity and growth, we\ncombine the needs of our clients, partners and\ncommunities with our expertise to drive       \nsustainable, inclusive solutions.             \n                                              \n       Core to our inclusive growth strategy  \n       is our work in Community Development   \n       Finance through Goldman Sachs\u2019 Urban   \n       Investment Group, which provides       \n       innovative and responsive capital      \n       solutions to help meet the needs of    \n  \u220e    low-to moderate-income communities     \n       across the U.S. To date, the Urban     \n       Investment Group has deployed more     \n       than $19 billion in real estate        \n       projects, social enterprises and       \n       lending facilities for small           \n       businesses.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n       In 2009 we launched 10,000 Small       \n       Businesses, which provides business    \n       education, access to capital and       \n       support services to small businesses   \n       in the U.S., U.K. and France.

Our executive        \n       compensation program is intended to    \n       incentivize our people to stay at      \n       Goldman Sachs and to aspire to these   \n       senior roles.                          \n                                              \nTo this end, the Committee regularly evaluates\nour NEO compensation program using            \nbenchmarking to help ensure that our senior   \nroles are properly valued, taking into account\ncompensation program design and structure, as \nwell as multi-year financial performance and  \nquantum of NEO pay at our Peers. The Committee\nmay also receive additional benchmarking      \ninformation with respect to other companies   \nwith which the firm competes for talent (e.g.,\nalternative and other asset managers, S&P 100 \ncompanies).                                   \n                                              \n       The Committee performs this            \n       evaluation with information and        \n  \u220e    assistance from HCM and the            \n       Committee\u2019s independent compensation   \n       consultant, Frederic W.

While these strategic actions   \n       negatively impacted short-term         \n       performance, the Compensation          \n       Committee believes that the actions    \n       of senior management were critical to  \n       reorienting the firm with a much       \n       stronger platform for 2024 and         \n       beyond.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       In addition, the Committee also        \n       considered how 2023 results were       \n       achieved, including how each NEO and   \n       each business contributed to the       \n  \u220e    various client, risk management and    \n       control, and people-related            \n       strategies and goals set forth in the  \n       Assessment Framework, including as     \n       described in \u20142023 Individual          \n       Performance.                           \n                                              \nThe execution of our narrowed strategic focus \nand progress on our broader strategic         \npriorities was central to our Compensation    \nCommittee decisions for 2023 compensation.    \nThese actions reinforced the firm\u2019s commitment\nto serve our clients with excellence and      \nfurther strengthen our client franchise, which\nis reflected in the firm\u2019s achievements over  \nthe past year.                                \n                                              \n       Our NEOs, and in particular our        \n       Executive Leadership Team, recognized  \n  \u220e    the need to clarify and simplify our   \n       forward strategy and swiftly executed  \n       on actions to narrow our strategic     \n       focus, including:                      \n                                              \n                                              \n       The exit of our Marcus lending         \n  \u00bb    business and sale of substantially     \n       all of our Marcus loan portfolio;      \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u00bb    The sale of our Personal Financial     \n       Management business;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       The announcement of the sale of        \n  \u00bb    GreenSky, and the sale of the          \n       majority of our GreenSky loan          \n       portfolio;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual         \n  Meeting of                              43  \n  Shareholders | Goldman Sachs                \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION MATTERS\u2014COMPENSATION DISCUSSION  \nAND ANALYSIS 2023 ANNUAL COMPENSATION         \n                                              \n       An agreement with General Motors       \n  \u00bb    regarding a process to transition      \n       their credit card program to another   \n       issuer; and                            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Continued progress on strategic        \n  \u00bb    priorities in Global Banking\u00a0&         \n       Markets and Asset\u00a0& Wealth             \n       Management.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Each of our NEOs also focused on the   \n       continued commitment to an operating   \n       approach that delivers One Goldman     \n  \u220e    Sachs to our clients, is underscored   \n       by a multi-year financial-planning     \n       process, invests in new and existing   \n       capabilities and enhances              \n       accountability and transparency.       \n                                              \nThe Committee continues to focus on ensuring  \nthat the structure and amount of NEO          \ncompensation appropriately incentivizes our   \nNEOs to continue to build long-term,          \nsustainable growth and to achieve our         \nfinancial targets, without undue emphasis on  \nshorter-term results.                         \n                                              \n      As\u2026                                     \n      of                                      \n      20\u2026                                     \n      Fi\u2026                                     \n      Pe\u2026                                     \n           ROE                                \n           7.\u2026                           EPS  \n           (+\u2026                           $2\u2026  \n           pe\u2026                     R\u2026    (+\u2026  \n           po\u2026              Net    N\u2026    Ex.  \n  F\u2026       Ex.

Qualified Retirement     \nBenefits During 2023, each NEO other than Mr. \nBerlinski participated in The Goldman Sachs   \n401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan), which is our U.S.  \nbroad-based tax-qualified retirement plan. In \n2023, these individuals were eligible to make \npre-tax and/ or \u201cRoth\u201d after-tax contributions\nto our 401(k) Plan and receive a dollar-for-  \ndollar matching contribution from us on the   \namount they contributed, up to a maximum of   \n$12,500. For 2023, these individuals each     \nreceived a matching contribution of $12,500.  \nMr. Berlinski has not participated in the U.K.\ndefined contribution arrangement, known as    \nLifeSight (the U.K. Defined Contribution      \nArrangement), since July 2019, when he        \nrelocated on assignment to the U.S. The firm  \nprovides overseas employees who can no longer \nparticipate in the U.K. Defined Contribution  \nArrangement with an annual payment in lieu of \ntheir participation. The amount of this       \npayment for 2023 for Mr. Berlinski was        \n$20,535, which is approximately equal to the  \nfirm\u2019s annual cost in respect of participation\nin the U.K. Defined Contribution Arrangement. \nPerquisites and Other Benefits Our NEOs       \nreceived in 2023 certain benefits that are    \nconsidered \u201cperquisites\u201d for purposes of the  \nSEC rules regarding compensation disclosure.  \nWhile our Compensation Committee was provided \nwith the estimated value of these items, it   \ndetermined, as in prior years, not to give    \nthese amounts significant consideration in    \ndetermining our NEOs\u2019 2023 variable           \ncompensation.                                 \n                                              \n        Goldman Sachs\u2002|\u2002Proxy\u00a0Statement\u00a0for\u00a0  \n  54    the\u00a02024\u00a0Annual\u00a0Meeting\u00a0of\u00a0           \n        Shareholders                          \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION MATTERS\u2014COMPENSATION DISCUSSION  \nAND ANALYSIS GS GIVES During 2023, we made    \navailable to each of our Executive Leadership \nTeam a car and driver and, in some cases,     \nother services, including for security. We    \nalso offered our NEOs benefits and tax        \ncounseling services, generally provided or    \narranged by our subsidiary, The Ayco Company, \nL.P. (Ayco), to assist them with tax and      \nregulatory compliance and to provide them with\nmore time to focus on the needs of our        \nbusiness. Our NEOs participate in our         \nexecutive medical and dental program and      \nreceive executive life insurance while they   \nremain PMDs. Our NEOs also receive long-term  \ndisability insurance coverage. Our NEOs (and  \ntheir covered dependents) are also eligible   \nfor a retiree healthcare program and receive  \ncertain other perquisites, some of which have \nno incremental cost to us. At our request, Mr.\nColeman relocated from London to our New York \noffice in 2021, and Mr. Berlinski did so in   \n2019. To this end, during 2023, consistent    \nwith our standard Global Mobility Services    \nprograms, Messrs. Coleman and Berlinski       \nreceived international assignment relocation  \nbenefits and tax protection and/or            \nequalization payments, as applicable, in      \nconnection with their respective arrangements.\nSee \u201cAll Other Compensation\u201d and footnote (e) \nin \u2014Executive Compensation\u20142023 Summary       \nCompensation Table.

GS Givesunderscores our         \ncommitment to philanthropy through diversified\nand impactful giving, harnessing the          \ncollaborative spirit of the firm\u2019s partnership\nwhile also inspiring our firm\u2019s next          \ngeneration of philanthropists. We ask our PMDs\nto make recommendations of not-for-profit     \norganizations to receive grants from the      \nfirm\u2019s contributions to GS Gives. GS Giveshas \nmade approximately $2.5 billion in grants and \npartnered with over 9,400 not-for-profit      \norganizations supporting 140+ countries around\nthe world since its inception. Grant          \nrecommendations from our PMDs help to ensure  \nthat GS Givesinvests in a diverse group of    \ncharities that improves the lives of people in\ncommunities around the world. We encourage our\nPMDs to make recommendations of grants to     \norganizations consistent with GS Gives\u2019mission\nof fostering innovative ideas, solving        \neconomic and social issues and enabling       \nprogress in underserved communities globally. \nGS Givesundertakes diligence procedures for   \ndonations and has no obligation to follow     \nrecommendations made to us by our PMDs. In    \n2023, GS Givesaccepted the recommendations of \nover 500 current and retired PMDs and granted \nover $190 million to over 2,700 not-for-profit\norganizations around the world. GS Givesmade  \ngrants across a wide range of areas, including\naccess to high quality education, support for \nveterans, and innovative medical research, in \naddition to our continued support for the     \nAnalyst Impact Fund, which allows analysts to \ncompete for a grant from GS Givesfor the      \nnonprofit of their choice.

For a discussion\nof 2023 annual NEO compensation, please read  \n\u2014Compensation Discussion and Analysisabove.   \nPursuant to SEC rules, the 2023 Summary       \nCompensation Table is required to include for \na particular year only those equity-based     \nawards granted during that year, rather than  \nawards granted after year-end, even if awarded\nfor services in that year.

The present values       \n       shown in this column were determined   \n       using the following assumptions:       \n       payment of a single life annuity       \n       following retirement at either the     \n       normal retirement age (age 65) or      \n       immediately (if an NEO is over 65); a  \n       5.08% discount rate; and mortality     \n       estimates based on the Pri-2012 white  \n       collar fully generational mortality    \n       table, with adjustments to reflect     \n       continued improvements in mortality    \n       based on Scale MP-2021. Our GS         \n       Pension Plan provides for early        \n       retirement benefits, and all of our    \n       participating NEOs became or will      \n       become eligible to elect early         \n       retirement benefits upon reaching age  \n       55. Prior to being frozen, our GS      \n  (b)  U.K. Retirement Plan provided for an   \n       annual benefit equal to 1.25% of the   \n       first \u00a381,000 of the participant\u2019s     \n       compensation for each year of          \n       credited service. The normal form of   \n       payment is a single life annuity plus  \n       a contingent spouse\u2019s annuity equal    \n       to two-thirds of the member\u2019s          \n       pension. Mr.\u00a0Berlinski has two         \n       records in the plan: the normal        \n       retirement age for the first period    \n       of service is age 50, and the normal   \n       retirement age for the second period   \n       of service is age 65. The present      \n       value shown in this column reflects    \n       Mr.\u00a0Berlinski\u2019s accrued benefits with  \n       an annual cost of living adjustment    \n       that is applied pursuant to the terms  \n       of the GS U.K. Retirement Plan and     \n       was determined using the following     \n       assumptions: payment of a joint life   \n       annuity following retirement at        \n       normal retirement age; a 4.70%         \n       discount rate; mortality estimates     \n       based on the \u201cS3 series all pensioner  \n       very light\u201d mortality table, with      \n       adjustments to reflect continued       \n       improvements in mortality; and the GS  \n       U.K. Retirement Plan\u2019s provision of    \n       early retirement benefits in respect   \n       of his second period of service and    \n       Mr.\u00a0Berlinski\u2019s eligibility to elect   \n       early retirement benefits upon         \n       reaching age 55.                       \n                                              \nFor a description of our 401(k) Plan and our  \nU.K. Defined Contribution Arrangement, which  \nare our tax-qualified defined contribution    \nplans in the U.S. and U.K., respectively, see \n\u2014Compensation Discussion and Analysis\u2014Other   \nCompensation Policies and Practices.          \n                                            \n  2023 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation  \n                                            \nThe following table sets forth information for\neach NEO, as applicable, with respect to      \nvested RSUs granted for service in prior years\nfor which the underlying shares of Common     \nStock had not yet been delivered during 2023  \n(Vested and Undelivered RSUs).

PMDs  \nwho were promoted or hired as a PMD before    \nJanuary 1, 2021, and retired with at least    \neight years of PMD service, are provided a    \nsubsidy equal to 100% of the individual       \npremium; any elected coverage for             \nspouses/partners or dependents is not         \nsubsidized by the firm. PMDs who were promoted\nor hired on or after January 1, 2021, or      \nretire with less than eight years of PMD      \nservice, do not receive a subsidy toward      \nretiree healthcare and are required to pay    \n100% of the retiree medical premium for       \nthemselves, their spouses/partners and        \ndependents. In the case of a termination for  \nCause, the present value of premiums for our  \nretiree healthcare program would be $0 for    \neach of our NEOs. In the case of a termination\nof employment for any other reason, Ms.       \nRuemmler is eligible to receive access to the \nretiree healthcare program at full cost to her\nwith no subsidy; the present value of her     \nfirm-subsidized premium is thus $0. Each of   \nour other NEOs is eligible for subsidized     \ncoverage of his individual premium, the       \npresent value of which is: Mr. Solomon \u2013      \n$309,462, Mr. Waldron \u2013 $426,334, Mr. Coleman \n\u2013 $489,153 and Mr. Berlinski \u2013 $522,289. The  \nvalues provided above reflect the present     \nvalue of the cost to us of the 100% individual\nsubsidy starting in 2024 and were determined  \nusing a December 31, 2023 retirement date and \nthe following assumptions: a 5.08% discount   \nrate; mortality estimates based on the        \nPRI-2012 white collar fully generational      \nmortality table, with adjustments to reflect  \ncontinued improvements in mortality based on  \nScale MP-2021; estimates of future increases  \nin healthcare subsidy costs of 7.50% pre-65,  \n8.75% post-65 and then grading down gradually \neach year until ultimate rate of 4.50% for    \nmedical and pharmacy in 2032 and 4.00% each   \nyear for dental; and assumptions for          \nsubsequent eligibility for alternative        \ncoverage, which would eliminate subsidies     \nunder our program (60% firm subsidized and 40%\nnot firm subsidized). If an NEO becomes       \nassociated with certain entities, including   \ncertain Covered Enterprises, the NEO will     \nforfeit some or all of their benefits and/or  \ncoverage under our retiree healthcare program.\nOther Terms As PMDs and members of the        \nManagement Committee, our NEOs are generally  \nsubject to a policy of six months\u2019 notice of  \ntermination of employment. We may require that\nan NEO be inactive (i.e., on \u201cgarden leave\u201d)  \nduring the notice period (or we may waive the \nrequirement). For purposes of describing our  \nPSUs, RSUs and SVC Awards, the above-         \nreferenced terms generally have the following \nmeanings: \u201c Cause\u201d means the NEO (a) is       \nconvicted in a criminal proceeding on certain \nmisdemeanor charges, on a felony charge or an \nequivalent charge; (b) engages in employment  \ndisqualification conduct under applicable law;\n(c) willfully fails to perform their duties to\nGoldman Sachs; (d) violates any securities or \ncommodities laws, rules or regulations or the \nrules and regulations of any relevant exchange\nor association of which we are a member;

As detailed in our\u00a0\u2014  \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis above,   \nthe Compensation Committee places substantial \nimportance on the assessment of firmwide      \nperformance when determining NEO compensation.\nTo this end, the Committee utilizes the       \nAssessment Framework to assess a variety of   \nfinancial and nonfinancial measures in        \napplying its informed judgment to evaluate and\nset annual pay amounts. See\u00a0\u2014 Compensation    \nDiscussion and Analysis\u20142023 Annual           \nCompensation .                                \nWe believe that the structure of our equity-  \nbased awards provides an intrinsic link to the\nfirm\u2019s longer-term performance. Through the   \nuse of PSUs, the amounts ultimately realized  \nby our NEOs with respect to annual            \ncompensation are subject to ongoing           \nperformance metrics (absolute and relative    \nROE) and are further tied to the firm\u2019s       \nlonger-term performance through stock price   \n(settlement of PSUs and Shares at Risk        \ndelivered in respect thereof). Given the use  \nof ROE in our annual PSUs, ROE has been       \nincluded as our \u201ccompany-selected measure\u201d in \nthe table below.                              \nWhile the Committee takes into account each of\nthe measures in our Assessment Framework in a \nholistic manner to evaluate executive         \ncompensation in consideration of firm         \nperformance (without ascribing any specific   \nweight to any single factor or metric), the   \nbelow measures from the Assessment Framework  \nhave been selected as they represent those    \nfirmwide performance measures for which the   \nfirm currently has set forward financial      \ntargets.                                      \n                     \n  \u220eROE               \n  \u220eROTE              \n  \u220eEfficiency Ratio  \n                     \nIn addition, our one-time SVC Awards provide  \nadditional, longer-term incentives for our    \nNEOs that are directly tied to the firm\u2019s     \nlonger-term performance (as measured by       \nabsolute and relative TSR).                   \nThe amounts set forth below in the required   \ntable are calculated pursuant to SEC rules but\ndo not represent amounts that have been       \nactually earned or realized by our NEOs,      \nincluding in respect of PSUs and SVC Awards.  \nPerformance conditions for many of these      \nawards have either not yet been satisfied or  \napplicable performance information is not yet \navailable.

FW Cook assessed the    \nstructure of our Director Compensation Program\nand its value compared to competitive market  \npractices, taking into account the emphasis on\nequity compensation, the hold-through         \nretirement requirement and other restrictions \non the RSUs, as well as the August 2020       \nresolution of the director compensation       \nlitigation and the fixed amount of annual     \ndirector compensation specified in the SIP,   \nwhich was approved by our shareholders at the \n2021 Annual Meeting.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS Selection of\nthe Chairman of the Board:The Board requires  \nthe separation of the offices of the Chairman \nof the Board and the Chief Executive Officer. \nWhenever possible, the Chairman of the Board  \nshall be an Independent Director. The Board   \nmay select a Temporary Chairman of the Board  \nwho is not an Independent Director to serve   \nwhile the Board seeks an Independent Chairman \nof the Board. The Chairman should not be a    \nformer CEO of the company. Selection of the   \nChairman of the Board shall be consistent with\napplicable law and existing contracts.        \nSUPPORTING STATEMENT: The Chief Executive     \nOfficer of Goldman Sachs is also Board        \nChairman. These roles \u2013 each with separate,   \ndifferent responsibilities that are critical  \nto the health of a successful corporation \u2013   \nare greatly diminished when held by a singular\ncompany official, weakening its governance    \nstructure. Expert perspectives substantiate   \nour position:                                 \n                                              \n       According to the CFA Institute         \n       Research and Policy Center,            \n       \u201cCombining [Chairman and CEO]          \n       positions may give undue influence to  \n       executive board members and impair     \n       the ability and willingness of board   \n  \u220e    members to exercise their independent  \n       judgment . Many jurisdictions          \n       consider the separation of the chair   \n       and CEO positions a best practice      \n       because it ensures that the board      \n       agenda is set by an independent voice  \n       uninfluenced by the CEO.\u201d1             \n                                              \n                                              \n       A pair of business law professors      \n       wrote for Harvard Business Review      \n       that \u201cletting the CEO chair the board  \n       can compromise board discussion        \n       quality, weakening the corporation\u2019s   \n       risk management ability . Splitting    \n  \u220e    the CEO and board chair jobs between   \n       two people can help strengthen the     \n       quality of questions the corporation   \n       asks itself. When those questions      \n       remain weak, the organization is less  \n       likely to develop strategies that      \n       mitigate risk.\u201d2                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Proxy adviser Glass Lewis wrote in     \n       2021, \u201cthe presence of an independent  \n       chair fosters the creation of a        \n       thoughtful and dynamic board not       \n  \u220e    dominated by the views of senior       \n       management ... the separation of       \n       these two key roles eliminates the     \n       conflict of interest that inevitably   \n       occurs when a CEO is responsible for   \n       self-oversight.\u201d3                      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Of former CEOs serving as Chairs, CFA  \n       Institute says, \u201cthis arrangement      \n       could impair the board\u2019s ability to    \n  \u220e    act independently of undue management  \n       influence... Such a situation also     \n       increases the risk that the chair may  \n       hamper efforts to undo the mistakes    \n       made as chief executive.\u201d              \n                                              \nAccording to the 2022 Spencer Stuart Board    \nIndex survey, 51 percent of S&P 500 companies \nhad separate CEOs and Board Chairs in 2017    \nversus 57 percent in 2022. 4The growing       \nseparation of the CEO and Chair positions     \nsignifies the changing sentiment towards Chair\nindependence.                                 \n                                              \n  1  https://rpc.cfainstitute.org/-/media/d\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  2  https://hbr.org/2020/03/why-the-ceo-sh\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  3  https://www.glasslewis.com/wp-content/\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  4  https://www.spencerstuart.com/-/media/\u2026  \n                                              \n                             \n  Directors\u2019 Recommendation  \n                             \nOUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE       \nAGAINST THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS Supporting  \nStatement Full disclosure of Goldman\u2019s        \nlobbying activities and expenditures is needed\nto assess whether Goldman\u2019s lobbying is       \nconsistent with its expressed goals and       \nshareholders\u2019 interests. Goldman spent $44    \nmillion from 2010 \u2013 2022 on federal lobbying. \nThis does not include state lobbying, where   \nGoldman also lobbies. Goldman also lobbies    \nabroad, spending between \u20ac800,000 \u2013 899,999 on\nlobbying in Europe for 2022 and drawing       \nscrutiny for hiring JPMorgan\u2019s chief lobbyist \nin Europe. 1 Companies can give unlimited     \namounts to third party groups that spend      \nmillions on lobbying and undisclosed          \ngrassroots activity. 2Goldman fails to        \ndisclose its memberships in or payments to    \ntrade associations and social welfare groups, \nor the amounts used for lobbying, to          \nshareholders. Goldman belongs to the American \nBankers Association (ABA), Bank Policy        \nInstitute (BPI), Business Roundtable,         \nFinancial Service Forum (FSF), Managed Funds  \nAssociation and Securities Industry and       \nFinancial Markets Association, which together \nspent $46 million on federal lobbying for     \n2022. Goldman\u2019s lack of disclosure presents   \nreputational risks when its lobbying          \ncontradicts company public positions. For     \nexample, Goldman publicly supports addressing \nclimate change, yet the Business Roundtable   \nopposed the Inflation Reduction Act and its   \nhistoric investments in climate action, 3and  \nBPI and FSF both lobbied the Securities and   \nExchange Commission to weaken proposed climate\ndisclosure rules. 4A recent analysis looking  \nat inconsistencies between banks\u2019 public      \nclimate commitments and their direct and      \nindirect climate lobbying practices noted     \nGoldman failed to publicly support the        \nInflation Reduction Act. 5And while Goldman   \ndoes not belong to or support the American    \nLegislative Exchange Council, which is        \nattacking \u201cwoke\u201d investing, 6one of its trade \nassociations does, as ABA supported its 2022  \nannual meeting. 7 Reputational damage stemming\nfrom these misalignments could harm           \nshareholder value. Thus it is a best practice \nfor Goldman to expand its lobbying disclosure.\n1https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2022/1\n2/goldman-government-relations.               \n2https://theintercept.com/2019/08/06/business-\ngroup-spending-on-lobbying-in-washington-is-  \nat-least-double-whats-pubIiclyreported/. 3http\ns://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/1\n9/top-us-business-lobby-group-climate-action- \nbusiness-roundtable.                          \n4https://www.eenews.net/articles/banks-to-sec-\nclimate-rule-poses-real-world-problems/.      \n5https://www.ceres.org/news-center/press-     \nreleases/new-benchmark-analysis-us-banks-     \nreveals-inconsistencies-between-climate. 6http\ns://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2023/03/22/esg-   \ninvesting-fossil-fuels.                       \n7https://documented.net/investigations/heres- \nwho-bankrolling-alec-2022-annual-meeting.     \n                             \n  Directors\u2019 Recommendation  \n                             \nOUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE       \nAGAINST THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL. Our         \nStatement on Policy Engagement and Political  \nParticipation (our Policy Statement, available\non our website through www.gs.com/corpgov )   \nand our existing public disclosures already   \naddress the most material requests in the     \nproposal.

Supporting        \nStatement In 2021, after receiving majority   \nsupport for a shareholder resolution          \nrequesting they do so, Goldman released a     \nreport reviewing its mandatory arbitration    \nrequirement for employee harassment or        \ndiscrimination claims. In light of that       \nreview, the Board decided that \u201cemployees who \nassert a claim of sexual harassment in an     \narbitration will have the option to waive     \nconfidentiality as to the arbitration         \ndecision. \u201d1The firm did not release other    \nprotected classes from this confidentiality   \nobligation. Investor concerns related to      \nGoldman\u2019s treatment of its employees by race, \nethnicity, and other protected class remained \nunaddressed. Black individuals comprise 13.6  \npercent of the United States\u2019 population 2but \nonly 3.4 percent of Goldman\u2019s executive and   \nmanagement teams. 3This representation        \npercentage has remained static over time, only\nincreasing by 0.31 percent since 2020 4, the  \nfirst year for which this data was available. \n                                              \n        Goldman Sachs\u2002|\u2002Proxy\u00a0Statement\u00a0for\u00a0  \n  82    the\u00a02024\u00a0Annual\u00a0Meeting\u00a0of\u00a0           \n        Shareholders                          \n                                              \nITEMS 4-12. SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS Given the   \ncompany\u2019s ongoing use of non-disclosure       \nagreements and mandatory arbitration, which   \nconceal from external audiences internal      \nculture challenges, the extent to which race- \nbased harassment and discrimination exists    \nwithin Goldman is unknown. There have been    \nseveral high-profile derivative suits settled,\nincluding at Twentieth Century Fox, Wynn      \nResorts, and Alphabet, alleging boards        \nbreached their duties by failing to protect   \nemployees from discrimination and harassment, \ninjuring the companies and their shareholders.\nCivil rights violations within the workplace  \ncan result in substantial costs to companies, \nincluding fines and penalties, legal costs,   \ncosts related to absenteeism, reduced         \nproductivity, challenges recruiting, and      \ndistraction of leadership. A company\u2019s failure\nto properly manage its workforce can have     \nsignificant ramifications, jeopardizing       \nrelationships with customers and other        \npartners. A public report such as the one     \nrequested would assist shareholders in        \nassessing whether the Company is improving its\nworkforce management.                         \n                                              \n  1  https://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-\u2026  \n     program.pdf                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  2  https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  3  https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-commi\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  4  https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-commi\u2026  \n                                              \n                             \n  Directors\u2019 Recommendation  \n                             \nOUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE       \nAGAINST THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL. There is no \nplace at Goldman Sachs for discrimination or  \nharassment against any individual or group in \nany form.Providing employees a safe and       \ninclusive workplace that is free of           \ndiscrimination and harassment is among the    \nfirm\u2019s highest priorities as part of our      \n\u201cpeople first\u201d commitment. The use of         \narbitration or confidentiality agreements to  \nassist in managing our broad and diverse      \nglobal workforce does not result in \u2013 nor does\nit imply the existence of \u2013 harassment or     \ndiscrimination at Goldman Sachs. While the    \nproponent\u2019s supporting statement references   \nsettlements at other public companies, those  \nmatters do not involve Goldman Sachs.

The \nUnited Nations has recognized that all people \nhave a right to a clean, healthy and          \nsustainable environment. 1Fossil fuel         \ndevelopment poses substantial risks to this   \nand other human rights, and has been linked to\nsignificantly elevated rates of cancers, and  \nair, soil, and water contamination for nearby \nresidents. 2These outcomes disproportionately \naffect children, workers, and people who are  \nBlack, Indigenous, have low income, or live in\nthe Global South. 3Meanwhile, a               \ndisproportionate portion of the 17 million    \nAmericans exposed to the negative consequences\nof fossil fuel production are Black. 4Since   \n2016, Goldman Sachs has provided over $143    \nbillion in financing to fossil fuel companies.\n5 Goldman Sachs has also developed a framework\nto \u201cput climate transition and inclusive      \ngrowth at the forefront of\u201d its work with     \nclients. 6However, this transition carries    \nseveral workforce 7and environmental justice  \nrisks. Research has found that economic and   \nworkforce benefits of the energy transition   \naccrue unequally along lines of race and      \nethnicity, regardless of income or education. \n8Most minerals required for electric vehicle, \nwind turbine, and battery production are      \nconcentrated in the Global South, where local \npeople bear environmental harms associated    \nwith minerals extraction, and where climate   \nchange threatens production collapse.         \n9Resultant civic unrest, loss of social       \n                                              \n        Goldman Sachs\u2002|\u2002Proxy\u00a0Statement\u00a0for\u00a0  \n  84    the\u00a02024\u00a0Annual\u00a0Meeting\u00a0of\u00a0           \n        Shareholders                          \n                                              \nITEMS 4-12.

These environmental justice\nrisks are not effectively addressed or managed\nin Goldman Sachs\u2019 policies and reporting.     \nRigorous assessment and disclosure of these   \nrisks would enhance the bank\u2019s risk management\nframework, improve its reputation, and advance\nits stated goals. In recent years, Goldman    \nSachs has faced regulatory action and public  \nscrutiny regarding its sustainability         \npractices and disclosures. In 2022, the bank\u2019s\nasset management subsidiary incurred a $4     \nmillion penalty to settle SEC charges for     \nsustainability-related policies and procedures\nfailures. 10The bank has committed to help    \nreduce racial disparities, 11to \u201cprotect,     \npreserve and promote human rights around the  \nworld,\u201d 12and shared its view that \u201ccompanies\u2019\nmanagement of environmental and related social\nrisks and opportunities may affect long-term  \ncorporate performance.\u201d By implementing this  \nproposal, the bank can advance its commitments\nand deliver value to shareholders.            \nResolved:Shareholders request that the Goldman\nSachs Board of Directors conduct a rigorous   \nassessment of material risks and opportunities\nrelated to the environmental justice impacts  \nof its energy and power sector financing and  \nunderwriting and disclose the results, at     \nreasonable expense and omitting proprietary   \nand privileged information.

(\u201cGoldman\u201d) disclose annually its Clean  \nEnergy Supply Financing Ratio (\u201cRatio\u201d),      \ndefined as its total financing through equity \nand debt underwriting, and project finance, in\nlow-carbon energy supply relative to that in  \nfossil-fuel energy supply. The disclosure,    \nprepared at reasonable expense and excluding  \nconfidential information, shall describe      \nGoldman\u2019s methodology, including what it      \nclassifies as \u201clow carbon\u201d or \u201cfossil fuel.\u201d  \nSupporting Statement The Intergovernmental    \nPanel on Climate Change (\u201cIPCC\u201d) has advised  \nthat greenhouse gas emissions must be halved  \nby 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. According \nto the International Energy Agency (\u201cIEA\u201d),   \nthis requires rapid transition away from      \nfossil fuels and a tripling in global annual  \nclean energy investment by 2030. 1 Banks      \naligning their activities with their own      \nclimate goals are better prepared to manage   \nthe risks, including legal, reputational and  \nfinancial risks, associated with the global   \nenergy transition. Furthermore, they can      \ncapitalize on profitable opportunities in     \nclean energy and position themselves as       \nleaders in a rapidly changing market. Since   \n2022, banks have reportedly earned more in    \nlending and underwriting fees from clean      \nenergy projects than from oil, gas, and coal  \ncompanies. 2 Goldman has committed to aligning\nits financing activities with a net zero 2050 \npathway and deploying $750 billion across its \nfinancing, investment and advisory activities \nby 2030 to help clients accelerate the climate\ntransition and advance inclusive growth.\u201d 3   \nWhile these commitments may appear            \nsignificant, investors need more information  \nto assess Goldman\u2019s relative financing of     \nfossil fuels, which totaled approximately $143\nbillion since 2016, ranking it one of fossil  \nfuels\u2019 largest financers. 4 According to      \nBloombergNEF\u2019s recent report, Financing the   \nTransition: Energy Supply Investment and Bank \nFinancing Activity (\u201cBloombergNEF Report\u201d),   \n5the pace at which low-carbon energy supply is\nscaled up will dictate the rate               \n                                              \n  Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual         \n  Meeting of                              87  \n  Shareholders | Goldman Sachs                \n                                              \nITEMS 4-12.

Synthesizing the\nseven most frequently referenced 1.5C \u2013       \naligned pathways (IEA; Network for Greening   \nthe Financial System; IPCC), it concluded     \nthat, to achieve net zero emissions by 2050,  \nthe Ratio must reach a minimum of 4:1 by 2030,\nrise to 6:1 in the 2030s and 10:1 thereafter. \nClean-energy-to-fossil-fuel financing ratios  \nhave emerged as a key metric for assessing    \nprogress in financing the clean energy        \ntransition.

We believe  \nthe greatest contribution that we as a        \nfinancial institution can make on climate     \nissues is to help our clients achieve their   \nsustainability goals. To this end, over the   \npast two decades we have made a number of     \ncommitments commensurate with our role in the \nglobal economy to help address the impacts of \nclimate change and accelerate the transition  \nto a low-carbon economy. Clean energy         \nfinancing is incorporated into our strategic  \n$750 billion sustainable financing, investing \nand advisory activity target. In addition, we \nexpect that the regulatory standards related  \nto climate risk and the climate transition    \nwill continue to evolve across jurisdictions, \nparticularly in the coming years, which will  \nnecessitate further consideration of these    \nissues and a variety of new disclosures.

Item\n9. Shareholder Proposal Regarding a GSAM Proxy\nVoting Review The Presbyterian Church         \n(U.S.A.), through the Board of Pensions of the\nPresbyterian Church U.S.A., 100 Witherspoon   \nStreet, Louisville, Kentucky 40202, together  \nwith a co-filer, Portico Benefit Services,    \neach beneficial owner of at least $2,000 in   \nmarket value of the company\u2019s Common Stock for\nat least three years, are the proponents of   \nthe following shareholder proposal. The       \nproponents have advised us that a             \nrepresentative will present the proposal and  \nrelated supporting statement at our Annual    \nMeeting.                                      \n                         \n  Proponents\u2019 Statement  \n                         \nGoldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) is a    \nrespected global financial services leader    \nproviding multiple investment options for     \nclients addressing environmental, social and  \ngovernance (ESG) topics. GSAM understands the \nmateriality of climate risk and its negative  \nimpact on companies and the economy, however  \nour voting record on climate-related proposals\nhas dropped dramatically putting us far behind\nmany other investment firms. According to     \nShare Action\u2019s 2022 ranking of the top 68     \nmanagers 1voting record on 252 shareholder    \nproposals, GSAM ranked 59th of 68 asset       \nmanagers assessed, supporting only 35% of     \noverall proposals, and only 56% of            \nenvironmental resolutions. And in 2023 GSAM   \nvotes declined further on climate and racial  \njustice resolutions, for example voting for   \nonly 4 climate resolutions out of 65          \n(according to NPX filings of S&P 500 companies\nprovided by Diligent). This proxy voting      \nrecord seems inconsistent with GSAM\u2019s         \nmembership in several investing initiatives:  \n                                              \n       The Principles for Responsible         \n       Investment, a global investor network  \n  \u220e    representing more than $120 trillion   \n       in assets urges investors to vote on   \n       ESG issues and \u201cprioritize addressing  \n       systemic sustainability issues\u201d2.      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Climate Action 100+, an investor       \n       initiative urging the world\u2019s largest  \n       greenhouse gas emitters to reduce      \n  \u220e    emissions consistent with the Paris    \n       Agreement, flags votes for its         \n       members; Goldman lagged peers, voting  \n       for only 3 of 20 flagged proposals3.   \n                                              \nWhen voting GSAM looks primarily at near-term \nrisk created for a specific company. Such an  \napproach is shortsighted and fails to         \nacknowledge a multitude of physical and       \ntransition-related risks. In addition, proxy  \nvoting that appears to ignore the full scope  \nof climate risks creates reputational and     \nbusiness risk for the company, especially with\nglobal clients committed to ESG and concerned \nabout the broader economic impact of climate  \nchange. Similarly, we believe diversity issues\nare of material importance to companies and   \ninvestors. For years Goldman Sachs has        \naffirmed its commitment to diversity. But the \nproxy voting record on diversity and inclusion\nissues did not reflect GSAM\u2019s stated positions\non diversity, another concerning misalignment.\nWe further believe it is GSAM\u2019s fiduciary     \nresponsibility to consider the impacts of     \nclimate and diversity risks on both portfolio \ncompanies and portfolios as a whole and vote  \naccordingly. Thus, we request this special    \nreview.                                       \n                                              \n  Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual         \n  Meeting of                              89  \n  Shareholders | Goldman Sachs                \n                                              \nITEMS 4-12.

Goldman     \nSachs is committed to sustainability,         \nincluding climate transition and inclusive    \ngrowth, as well as advancing diversity, equity\nand inclusion, and we have a myriad of        \npolicies, practices and disclosures on an     \nenterprise-wide basis in support of these     \ncommitments. However, it is important to note \nthat this proposal attempts to link the       \nresponsibilities of our Board to the separate \nvoting practices that Goldman Sachs Asset     \nManagement (GSAM) exercises on behalf of its  \nclients. As further discussed below, GSAM owes\nfiduciary duties to its clients that are      \nseparate and distinct from the fiduciary      \nduties our Board owes to our shareholders. We \nbelieve that this proposal conflates the      \nBoard\u2019s oversight responsibilities with GSAM\u2019s\nfiduciary obligations to its clients. GSAM is \na registered investment adviser that owes     \nfiduciary duties to its clients, which        \nrequires that GSAM act in the best interests  \nof its clients. As a fiduciary, GSAM, within  \nits public markets investment business, is    \ncommitted to promoting and exercising         \neffective stewardship among the companies     \nrepresented in the portfolios GSAM manages on \nbehalf of its clients. GSAM exercises its     \nshareholder rights via proxy voting, engages  \nwith company management and participates in   \nvarious conferences and industry forums with a\nfocus on promoting long-term shareholder value\nfor its clients.

The proponent \nhas advised us that a representative will     \npresent the proposal and related supporting   \nstatement at our Annual Meeting.              \n                         \n  Proponent\u2019s Statement  \n                         \nFINANCIAL STATEMENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CLIMATE   \nCHANGE WHEREAS:Many policymakers, investors   \nand companies have converged on goals         \nincluding the need to limit global temperature\nincrease to 1.5\u00b0 C and to reach net zero      \nglobal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050.\nThe International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) Net   \nZero 2050 Roadmap (NZE) offers a normative,   \nnot scientific, energy sector path for net    \nzero GHG emissions. The IEA urges no          \ninvestment in new fossil supply projects to   \nachieve net zero: \u201cAs a share of total energy \nsupply, [fossil fuels] fall from 80% in 2020  \nto just over 20% in 2050.\u201d 1 In line with such\nassumptions, the Company has a goal to achieve\nnet zero carbon emissions in its operations   \nand supply chain by 2030, 2and has announced  \nthat it would \u201ctarget $750 billion in         \nfinancing, investing, and advisory activity to\nnine areas focused on these two priorities\u2026.\u201d \n3As of March 2021, the Company had already    \nreached \u201c$156 billion of [its] total,         \nincluding $93 billion dedicated to climate    \ntransition.\u201d 4The Company has also made clear \nits commitment to the Paris Agreement and has \n\u201calign[ed] [its] financing activities with a  \nnet zero by 2050 pathway.\u201d                    \n                                              \n  Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual         \n  Meeting of                              91  \n  Shareholders | Goldman Sachs                \n                                              \nITEMS 4-12. SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS These       \ninvestment decisions presume the normative IEA\nNZE is possible and is based on true          \nassumptions, but it is unclear what, if any,  \nanalysis Goldman Sachs has done to protect    \ncompany assets should NZE prove unsound. A    \n2023 study by the Energy Policy Research      \nFoundation (EPRF) found that net zero         \nadvocates have misconstrued the IEA\u2019s position\non new oil and gas investment, and that the   \nIEA has made questionable assumptions and     \nmilestones for NZE about government policies, \nenergy and carbon prices, behavioral changes, \neconomic growth, and technology maturity. 5   \nThe EPRF study found, \u201cOil and gas play       \nirreplaceable roles in modern civilization    \nthat are not reproducible with low- carbon    \nalternatives. The attempt to substitute them  \nwith inferior, less efficient, energy sources \nwill have enormous micro- and macroeconomic   \nconsequences and profound geopolitical        \nimplications.\u201d 6 NZE advocates speak in terms \nof fossil fuels as stranded assets, but no    \nconsideration has been given to whether the   \ntrue stranded assets might be the assets spent\non expensive renewable energy options based on\nfaulty assumptions. Should the EPRF\u2019s study   \nprove true, our Company stands to lose its    \nrenewable energy investments, plus the costs  \nof reverting back to reliable energy sources. \nAdditionally, it appears that most countries  \nare not really going to outlaw reliable and   \naffordable energy, further making current net-\nzero stranded-asset theory non-sensical. 7    \nRESOLVED:Shareholders request that the        \nCompany\u2019s Board seek an audited report        \nassessing how applying the findings of the    \nEnergy Policy Research Foundation and similar \nstudies would affect the assumptions, costs,  \nestimates, and valuations underlying its      \nfinancial statements, including those related \nto long-term commodity and carbon prices,     \nremaining asset lives, future asset retirement\nobligations, capital expenditures and         \nimpairments.

Item\n11. Shareholder Proposal Regarding Pay Equity \nReporting Mercy Rome, care of Newground Social\nInvestment, 111 Queen Anne Ave. N, #500,      \nSeattle, Washington 98109, together with co-  \nfilers Eric and Emily Johnson and the Robert  \nH. and Elizabeth Fergus Foundation, each a    \nbeneficial owner of at least $2,000 in market \nvalue of the company\u2019s Common Stock for at    \nleast three years, are the proponents of the  \nfollowing shareholder proposal. The proponents\nhave advised us that a representative will    \npresent the proposal and related supporting   \nstatement at our Annual Meeting.              \n                         \n  Proponent\u2019s Statement  \n                         \nRESOLVED:Shareholders request that the Goldman\nSachs Group, Inc. (\u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cGoldman Sachs\u201d,\nor \u201cGoldman\u201d) report annually on unadjusted   \nmedian and adjusted pay gaps across race and  \ngender globally, and include associated       \npolicy, reputational, competitive, and        \noperational risks \u2013 including risks associated\nwith recruiting and retaining diverse key     \ntalent. The report should be prepared at      \nreasonable cost, and omit proprietary         \ninformation, litigation strategy, and legal   \ncompliance information. Ideally, annual       \nreporting would integrate base, bonus, and    \nequity compensation broken out by country,    \nwhere appropriate, and further differentiate  \nbetween gender and racial/minority/ethnicity  \ngroupings. Racial/gender pay gaps are the     \ndifference between non-minority and           \nminority/male and female median earnings      \nexpressed as a percentage of non-minority/male\nearnings. S UPPORTINGS TATEMENT Goldman Sachs \nhas faced substantial scrutiny in recent years\nfor gender pay discrimination, which          \nculminated in a $215 million class-action     \nsettlement in May 2023. 1Ongoing pay          \ninequities \u2013 which persist across both race   \nand gender at Goldman \u2013 pose substantial risks\nto the Company. For instance, Black workers\u2019  \nmedian annual earnings represent just 77% of  \nwhite wages, while the median income for women\nworking full-time is only 84% that of men.    \nConsidering race, Black women earn 76% and    \nLatina women just 63%. 2                      \n                                              \n  Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual         \n  Meeting of                              93  \n  Shareholders | Goldman Sachs                \n                                              \nITEMS 4-12. SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS At the      \ncurrent trajectory, White women will not reach\npay equity until 2059 \u2013 three decades from    \nnow; Black women not until 2130 \u2013 a century   \nfrom now; and Latina women not until 2224 \u2013   \ntwo full centuries from now. 3                \nCitigroupestimates that had minority and      \ngender wage gaps been closed 20 years ago, it \nwould have contributed $12 trillion additional\ndollars to national income. Studies link      \ndiversity in leadership and managing pay      \nequity to superior stock performance as well  \nas higher return on equity. 4 Women and       \nminorities clearly face structural bias       \nregarding job opportunity and pay. At Goldman,\nunderrepresented minorities represent 47.0% of\nthe workforce but only 26.7% of executives.   \nWomen represent 42.9% of the workforce but    \nonly 25.1% of executives. Best practice pay   \nequity reporting consists of two parts:       \n                                              \n      Statistically adjusted gaps \u2013 which     \n  1.  assess whether minorities and           \n      non-minorities (both men and women)     \n      are paid equally for similar roles.     \n                                              \n                                              \n      Unadjusted median pay gaps \u2013 which      \n  2.  assess equal opportunity for high       \n      paying roles.                           \n                                              \nCurrently, Goldman reports neither adjustednor\nunadjustedquantitative pay gaps. In contrast, \nroughly 50% of the nation\u2019s top 100 companies \nreport adjustedgaps, and an increasing number \nalso disclose unadjustedgaps. 5 Racial and    \ngender unadjustedmedian pay gaps are accepted \nas thevalid way to measure pay inequity by the\nUnited States Census Bureau, Department of    \nLabor, OECD, and the International Labor      \nOrganization. The United Kingdom and Ireland  \nlegally mandate disclosure of median gender   \npay gaps. 6 T HEREFORE:Because gender and     \nequity pay gaps are inherently unfair, because\nthey have been shown to harm company          \nperformance, and because disparity continues  \nto be a serious issue that plagues Goldman    \nSachs, please vote FORthis commonsense        \nreporting proposal. ~ ~ ~                     \n                                              \n  1  https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/09/bus\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  2  https://www.census.gov/data/tables/tim\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  3  https://static1.squarespace.com/static\u2026  \n     rd+2022+-+Arjuna+Capital.pdf             \n                                              \n            \n  4  Ibid.  \n            \n                                              \n  5  https://diversiq.com/which-sp-500-comp\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  6  https://static1.squarespace.com/static\u2026  \n     rd+2022+-+Arjuna+Capital.pdf             \n                                              \n                             \n  Directors\u2019 Recommendation  \n                             \nOUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE       \nAGAINST THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL. We share the\nproponents\u2019 focus on pay equity. We recognize \nthere is a desire among certain stakeholders  \nfor publication of more data regarding pay \u2014  \nand we have already committed to providing    \nadditional information. We believe the        \nfundamental underlying issue for our firm and \nmany corporations is the representation of    \nwomen and diverse professionals both in       \nmagnitude and levels of seniority. We remain  \ncommitted to compensating our employees fairly\nand equitably and to fostering gender and     \nracial/ethnic diversity and inclusion in our  \nleadership ranks and broader workforce. To    \nthis end, we have policies and procedures in  \nplace with respect to our hiring, promotion   \nand compensation practices to support these   \ncommitments. This includes ensuring           \ncompensation decisions are subject to multiple\nlevels of review. We are also highly focused  \non providing transparency and accountability  \nto our investors and other stakeholders. For  \nexample, we continue to regularly report on   \nthe firm\u2019s progress towards our aspirational  \ndiversity goals, as well as our annual EEO-1  \ndemographic data. Furthermore, in connection  \nwith our 2023 annual meeting commitment, we   \nhave published information regarding our      \ngender and race pay gaps on our website at    \nwww.gs.com/corpgov. After taking into account \nour existing policies and procedures, as well \nas the publication of a pay equity statement, \nwe believe that the adoption of this proposal \nis unnecessary and not in the best interests  \nof our firm or our shareholders.              \n                                              \n        Goldman Sachs\u2002|\u2002Proxy\u00a0Statement\u00a0for\u00a0  \n  94    the\u00a02024\u00a0Annual\u00a0Meeting\u00a0of\u00a0           \n        Shareholders                          \n                                              \nITEMS 4-12.

Item 12.           \nShareholder Proposal Regarding Director       \nElection Resignation Bylaw The New York City  \nCarpenters Pension Fund, 395 Hudson Street,   \n9th Floor, New York, New York 10014,          \nbeneficial owner of at least $25,000 in market\nvalue of the company\u2019s Common Stock for at    \nleast one year, is the proponent of the       \nfollowing shareholder proposal. The proponent \nhas advised us that a representative will     \npresent the proposal and related supporting   \nstatement at our Annual Meeting.              \n                         \n  Proponent\u2019s Statement  \n                         \nDirector Election Resignation Bylaw Proposal: \nResolved:That the shareholders of Goldman     \nSachs Group Inc. (\u201cCompany\u201d) hereby request   \nthat the board of directors take the necessary\naction to adopt a director election           \nresignation bylaw that requires each director \nnominee to submit an irrevocable conditional  \nresignation to the Company to be effective    \nupon the director\u2019s failure to receive the    \nrequired shareholder majority vote support in \nan uncontested election. The proposed         \nresignation bylaw shall require the Board to  \naccept a tendered resignation absent the      \nfinding of a compelling reason or reasons to  \nnot accept the resignation. Further, if the   \nBoard does not accept a tendered resignation  \nand the director remains as a \u201choldover\u201d      \ndirector, the resignation bylaw shall         \nstipulate that should a \u201choldover\u201d director   \nfail to be re-elected at the next annual      \nelection of directors, that director\u2019s new    \ntendered resignation will be automatically    \neffective 30 days after the certification of  \nthe election vote. The Board shall report the \nreasons for its actions to accept or reject a \ntendered resignation in a Form 8-Kfiling with \nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  \nSupporting Statement:The Proposal requests    \nthat the Board establish a director           \nresignation bylaw to enhance director         \naccountability. The Company has established in\nits bylaws a majority vote standard for use in\nan uncontested director election, an election \nin which the number of nominees equal the     \nnumber of open board seats. Under applicable  \nstate corporate law, a director\u2019s term extends\nuntil his or her successor is elected and     \nqualified, or until he or she resigns or is   \nremoved from office. Therefore, an incumbent  \ndirector who fails to receive the required    \nvote for election under a majority vote       \nstandard continues to serve as a \u201choldover\u201d   \ndirector until the next meeting of            \nshareholders. A Company governance policy     \ncurrently addresses the continued status of an\nincumbent director who fails to be re-elected \nby requiring such director to tender his or   \nher resignation for Board consideration.      \n                                              \n  Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual         \n  Meeting of                              95  \n  Shareholders | Goldman Sachs                \n                                              \nITEMS 4-12. SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS The new     \ndirector resignation bylaw will set a more    \ndemanding standard of review for addressing   \ndirector resignations then that contained in  \nthe Company\u2019s resignation governance policy.  \nThe resignation bylaw will require the        \nreviewing directors to articulate a compelling\nreason or reasons for not accepting a tendered\nresignation and allowing an un-elected        \ndirector to continue to serve as a \u201choldover\u201d \ndirector. Importantly, if a director\u2019s        \nresignation is not accepted and he or she     \ncontinues as a \u201choldover\u201d director but again  \nfails to be elected at the next annual meeting\nof shareholders, that director\u2019s new tendered \nresignation will be automatically effective 30\ndays following the election vote              \ncertification. While providing the Board      \nlatitude to accept or not accept the initial  \nresignation of an incumbent director that     \nfails to receive majority vote support, the   \namended bylaw will establish the shareholder  \nvote as the final word when a continuing      \n\u201choldover\u201d director is not re-elected. The    \nProposal\u2019s enhancement of the director        \nresignation process will establish shareholder\nvoting in director elections as a more        \nconsequential governance right.               \n                             \n  Directors\u2019 Recommendation  \n                             \nOUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE       \nAGAINST THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL. Our         \ndirectors take very seriously their fiduciary \nobligation to act in the best interests of our\nfirm and our shareholders. Director           \naccountability is a critical element of this. \nImportantly, we already have in our By-Laws a \nmajority voting standard for uncontested      \nelections that includes a director resignation\npolicy. As a result, taking into account our  \ncurrent By-Laws, our robust director          \nnomination process and corporate governance   \nbest practices, as well as the fact that our  \nshareholders have not expressed any           \nsignificant concerns regarding our director   \nresignation policy to date, we believe the    \nadoption of this proposal is unnecessary and  \nnot in the best interests of our firm or our  \nshareholders.                                 \n                                              \n       Pursuant to our existing By-Laws, a    \n       director that does not receive         \n       majority support must immediately      \n       tender his or her resignation to the   \n       Board. The Board, excluding the        \n       impacted director, will promptly       \n       determine, through a process managed   \n       by our Governance Committee, which is  \n       comprised of independent directors,    \n  \u220e    whether to accept the resignation.     \n       Our By-Laws provide that the Board     \n       must accept the resignation unless a   \n       significant reason exists for the      \n       director to remain on the Board.       \n       Furthermore, in the event the Board    \n       determines to reject a director\u2019s      \n       tendered resignation, this             \n       determination and the Board\u2019s          \n       rationale must be disclosed in a Form  \n       8-K filed with the SEC.                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Our governance structure establishes   \n       strong protections of shareholder      \n       rights and promotes director           \n       accountability. For example, in        \n       addition to our majority voting        \n       bylaw, we have annual election of all  \n       directors, no poison pill, a           \n  \u220e    shareholder right to call special      \n       meetings, a shareholder right of       \n       proxy access, no supermajority vote    \n       requirements in our governing          \n       documents, a commitment to             \n       independent board leadership,          \n       individual director evaluations and a  \n       robust re-nomination process.          \n                                              \n                                              \n       As such, we do not believe amending    \n       our By-Laws in the unnecessarily       \n  \u220e    prescriptive manner set forth in the   \n       proposal will provide any additional   \n       value to our shareholders.             \n                                              \nFor more information about our Board,         \nincluding our director nomination processes,  \nsee Corporate Governance.                     \n                                              \n        Goldman Sachs\u2002|\u2002Proxy\u00a0Statement\u00a0for\u00a0  \n  96    the\u00a02024\u00a0Annual\u00a0Meeting\u00a0of\u00a0           \n        Shareholders                          \n                                              \nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS\nCertain Relationships and Related Transactions\nOn the recommendation of our independent      \ndirectors, our Board has in place various     \npolicies that provide guidelines for the      \nreview of certain relationships and           \ntransactions involving our directors and      \nexecutive officers. Related Person            \nTransactions Policy Our Board has a written   \nRelated Person Transactions Policy regarding  \nthe review and approval of transactions       \nbetween us and \u201crelated persons\u201d (directors,  \nexecutive officers, immediate family members  \nof a director or executive officer, or known  \n5% shareholders). Under this policy,          \ntransactions that exceed $120,000 in which a  \nrelated person has, may have or may be deemed \nto have a direct or indirect material interest\nare submitted to the Designated Reviewers (the\nChairs of the Governance, Audit and Risk      \nCommittees) or our full Governance Committee  \nfor review and approval, as applicable.       \nCertain transactions, including employment    \nrelationships, ordinary course banking,       \nbrokerage, investment, lending and other      \nservices, payment of certain regulatory filing\nfees and certain other ordinary course non-   \npreferential transactions, have been          \ndetermined by the Governance Committee to be  \npreapproved transactions, and thus do not     \nrequire specific review and approval under the\npolicy (although these transactions must be   \nreported to our Governance Committee and may  \nstill be submitted for review and approval if \ndeemed appropriate). In reviewing and         \ndetermining whether to approve a related      \nperson transaction, the following factors,    \namong others, are considered:                 \n                                              \n  \u220e    Whether the transaction is in the      \n       interests of us and our shareholders;  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction would impair   \n  \u220e    the independence of an independent     \n       director;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction presents a     \n       conflict of interest, taking into      \n       account the size of the transaction,   \n       the financial position of the          \n  \u220e    director or executive officer, the     \n       nature of the director\u2019s or executive  \n       officer\u2019s interest in the              \n       transaction, the ongoing nature of     \n       the transaction and any other          \n       relevant factors;                      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction is fair and    \n  \u220e    reasonable to us and on substantially  \n       the same terms as would apply to       \n       comparable third parties;              \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    The business reasons for the           \n       transaction;                           \n                                              \n                                     \n  \u220e    Any reputational issues; and  \n                                     \n                                              \n       Whether the transaction is material,   \n  \u220e    taking into account the significance   \n       of the transaction to our investors.   \n                                              \nAll of the transactions and relationships     \nreported under \u2014 Certain Relationships and    \nTransactionswere determined, under the        \nmechanisms of the Related Person Transactions \nPolicy, to be in the best interests of our    \nfirm and our shareholders. In addition to our \npolicies on director independence and related \nperson transactions, we also maintain a policy\nwith respect to outside director involvement  \nwith financial firms, such as private equity  \nfirms or hedge funds. Under this policy, in   \ndetermining whether to approve any current or \nproposed affiliation of a non-employee        \ndirector with a financial firm, our Board will\nconsider, among other things, the legal,      \nreputational, operational and business issues \npresented, and the nature, feasibility and    \nscope of any restrictions, procedures or other\nsteps that would be necessary or appropriate  \nto ameliorate any perceived or potential      \nfuture conflicts or other issues.             \n                                              \n  Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual         \n  Meeting of                              97  \n  Shareholders | Goldman Sachs                \n                                              \nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS\nCertain Relationships and Transactions        \n                                  \n  Brokerage and Banking Services  \n                                  \nSome of our directors and executive officers  \n(and persons or entities affiliated with them)\nhave brokerage and/or discretionary accounts  \nat our broker-dealer affiliates and may       \nutilize other ordinary course banking or      \nlending products (such as credit cards)       \noffered by GS Bank. Certain family office     \nentities affiliated with directors may from   \ntime to time invest in certificates or other  \nderivative or structured products issued by   \nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates on           \nsubstantially the same terms and conditions as\nother similarly-situated clients. Extensions  \nof credit by GS Bank that do not involve more \nthan the normal risk of collectability and do \nnot present other unfavorable features have   \nbeen and may be made to certain of our        \ndirectors and executive officers (and persons \nor entities affiliated with them) in the      \nordinary course of business on substantially  \nthe same terms, including interest rates and  \ncollateral, as those prevailing at the time   \nfor comparable transactions with persons      \nunrelated to our firm, and in each case in    \ncompliance with relevant laws and regulations.\n                                            \n  Firm-Managed Funds and Other Investments  \n                                            \nWe have established private investment funds  \n(Employee Funds) to permit our employees (and \nin certain cases, retired employees) to       \nparticipate in our private equity, hedge fund \nand other similar activities by investing in  \nor alongside funds and investments that we    \nmanage or sponsor for independent investors   \nand/or for our firm. We believe the           \nopportunity to make such investments helps to \npromote teamwork and collaboration across the \nfirm and provides alignment with the firm\u2019s   \nstrategy to grow the alternatives business.   \nInvestment decisions for the Employee Funds   \nare made by the investment teams or committees\nthat are fiduciaries for such funds, and no   \nexecutive officers are members of such        \ninvestment teams or committees. The Employee  \nFunds generally maintain diversified          \ninvestment portfolios, and these investment   \nopportunities do not affect the incentives of \nour executive officers under our compensation \nprogram. Many of our employees, their spouses,\nrelated charitable foundations or entities    \nthey own or control have invested in these    \nEmployee Funds. In some cases, we have limited\nparticipation to our PMDs, including our      \nexecutive officers, or limited the amount of  \nparticipation, and in some cases participation\nmay be limited to individuals eligible to     \ninvest pursuant to applicable law. Certain of \nthe Employee Funds provide applicable         \ninvestors with an interest in the overrides we\nreceive for managing the funds for independent\ninvestors (Overrides); the level of Override  \nfor which applicable investors may be eligible\nmay vary based on certain criteria. Employee  \nFunds generally do not require our current or \nretired PMDs and other current or retired     \nemployees to pay management fees and do not   \ndeduct Overrides from fund distributions.     \nSimilarly, certain other investments may be   \nmade available to our PMDs, retired PMDs      \nand/or other current employees on a fee-free  \nor reduced fee basis. Distributions and       \nredemptions exceeding $120,000 from Employee  \nFunds made to our 2023 executive officers (or \npersons or entities affiliated with them)     \nduring 2023, consisting of profits and other  \nincome and return of amounts initially        \ninvested (excluding Overrides, which are      \ndiscussed below), were approximately, in the  \naggregate, as follows: Mr. Solomon \u2013 $6.5     \nmillion; Mr. Waldron \u2013 $1.7 million; Mr.      \nColeman \u2013 $1.9 million; Ms. Ruemmler \u2013        \n$300,000; Mr. Berlinski \u2013 $351,000; John F.W. \nRogers (Executive Vice President) \u2013 $2.3      \nmillion; and Brian Lee (Chief Risk Officer) - \n$600,000. Overrides distributed to our 2023   \nexecutive officers (or persons or entities    \naffiliated with them) during 2023 were        \napproximately, in the aggregate, as follows:  \nMr. Solomon \u2013 $332,000; Mr. Waldron \u2013         \n$209,000; Mr. Coleman \u2013 $42,000; Ms. Ruemmler \n\u2013 $60,000; Mr. Berlinski \u2013 $30,000; Mr. Rogers\n\u2013 $175,000; Ericka Leslie (Chief              \nAdministrative Officer during 2023) \u2013 $50,000;\nMr. Lee \u2013 $86,000; and Sheara Fredman (Chief  \nAccounting Officer) \u2013 $31,000. Subject to     \napplicable laws, in addition, certain of our  \ndirectors and executive officers may from time\nto time invest their personal funds in other  \nfunds or investments that we have established \nand that we manage or sponsor. Except as      \ndescribed above, these other investments are  \nmade on substantially the same terms and      \nconditions as other similarly-situated        \ninvestors in these funds or investments who   \nare neither directors nor employees.

Mr. Mittal is the Executive Chairman and\nformer CEO of ArcelorMittal S.A. and          \nbeneficially owns (directly and indirectly)   \napproximately 40% of the outstanding common   \nshares of ArcelorMittal. Goldman Sachs        \nprovides ordinary course financial advisory,  \nlending, investment banking, trading (such as \nacting as a derivative counterparty from time \nto time) and other financial services to      \nArcelorMittal and its affiliates, including as\ndescribed below. Goldman Sachs participates in\na $5.5 billion five-year revolving credit     \nfacility for ArcelorMittal. Under this $5.5   \nbillion facility, Goldman Sachs has agreed to \nlend to ArcelorMittal up to $170 million at an\ninterest rate of SOFR + 720 basis points      \n(which rate may vary depending on             \nArcelorMittal\u2019s credit ratings). Goldman Sachs\ncurrently has no loan outstanding under this  \nfacility. Goldman Sachs also participates in a\n$212.5 million credit facility for an entity  \nin which ArcelorMittal is an approximately 25%\nshareholder. Under the facility, Goldman Sachs\nhas agreed to lend up to approximately $22.5  \nmillion at an interest rate of SOFR + 450     \nbasis points (which rate may vary based on a  \ncredit spread adjustment). This credit        \nfacility is currently partially drawn,        \nresulting in an approximately $19.4 million   \nloan from Goldman Sachs outstanding under this\nfacility. In addition, from March 2023 to     \nFebruary 2024, Goldman Sachs acted as riskless\nprincipal in connection with approximately    \n$290 million of on-exchange divestments by    \nArcelorMittal of its shareholding in an entity\nin which it was a minority shareholder. Each  \nof these transactions was conducted, and all  \nof these services were provided, on an        \narm\u2019s-length basis. Mr. Ogunlesi is the       \nChairman and Chief Executive Officer of Global\nInfrastructure Partners LLC (together with its\naffiliates, GIP). In connection with his role \nat GIP, Mr. Ogunlesi is entitled to less than \n5% of the total profit of the funds that      \nparticipated in the following transactions,   \nand he also has a direct or indirect interest \nin such funds amounting to less than 0.02% of \neach such fund. In May 2023, Goldman Sachs    \nacted as an underwriter in an approximately   \n$300 million public common stock offering for \na company in which a fund managed by GIP was a\nselling shareholder. Such fund received       \napproximately $145 million of the proceeds of \nthe offering. In addition, in August 2023,    \nGoldman Sachs purchased for resale in an SEC- \nregistered trade approximately $288 million of\nstock in such company from the fund managed by\nGIP as selling shareholder. Goldman Sachs\u2019    \nrelationship with this company pre-dates GIP\u2019s\ninvestment therein. In March 2024, Goldman    \nSachs also acted as an underwriter in an      \napproximately $3 billion public debt offering \nfor BlackRock Inc., the proceeds of which are \nintended to fund a portion of BlackRock\u2019s     \nacquisition of GIP.

We believe      \n       that the fees paid to The Vanguard     \n       Group through the Vanguard mutual      \n       funds are the same as the fees that    \n       are paid by the other holders of the   \n  (c)  same share classes of those funds.     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n         Goldman Sachs\u2002|\u2002Proxy\u00a0Statement\u00a0for  \n  102    the\u00a02024\u00a0Annual\u00a0Meeting\u00a0of\u00a0          \n         Shareholders                         \n                                              \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION Additional Information \nHow to Contact Us Across our shareholder base \nthere is a wide variety of viewpoints about   \nmatters affecting our firm.

ROTE is calculated by   \ndividing net earnings applicable to common    \nshareholders by average monthly tangible      \ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity (tangible common  \nshareholders\u2019 equity is calculated as total   \nshareholders\u2019 equity less preferred stock,    \ngoodwill and identifiable intangible assets). \nManagement believes that ROTE is meaningful   \nbecause it measures the performance of        \nbusinesses consistently, whether they were    \nacquired or developed internally, and that    \ntangible common shareholders\u2019 equity is       \nmeaningful because it is a measure that the   \nfirm and investors use to assess capital      \nadequacy. ROTE and tangible common            \nshareholders\u2019 equity are non-GAAP measures and\nmay not be comparable to similar non-GAAP     \nmeasures used by other companies.
