Solomon, our Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer, John E. Waldron, our President and\nChief Operating Officer, and Stephen M.\nScherr, our Chief Financial Officer.\n\nMr. Solomon\u2019s total annual compensation for\n2020 is $17,500,000, which compares to total\nannual compensation for 2019 of $27,500,000.\nMr. Solomon\u2019s 2020 compensation consists of an\nannual base salary of $2,000,000, which\nremains unchanged from last year, and annual\nvariable compensation of $15,500,000. 70% of\nthis annual variable compensation (i.e.,\n$10,850,000) was granted in the form of\nperformance-based restricted stock units\n(\u201cPSUs\u201d), with the remainder to be paid in the\nform of cash.\n\nMr. Waldron\u2019s total annual compensation for\n2020 is $18,500,000, which compares to total\nannual compensation for 2019 of $24,500,000.\nMr. Waldron\u2019s 2020 compensation consists of an\nannual base salary of $1,850,000, which\nremains unchanged from last year, and annual\nvariable compensation of $16,650,000. 60% of\nthis annual variable compensation (i.e.,\n$9,990,000) was granted in the form of PSUs,\nwith the remainder to be paid in the form of\ncash.\n\nMr. Scherr\u2019s total annual compensation for\n2020 is $15,500,000, which compares to total\nannual compensation for 2019 of $22,500,000.\nMr. Scherr\u2019s 2020 compensation consists of an\nannual base salary of $1,850,000, which\nremains unchanged from last year, and annual\nvariable compensation of $13,650,000. 60% of\nthis annual variable compensation (i.e.,\n$8,190,000) was granted in the form of PSUs,\nwith the remainder to be paid in the form of\ncash.\n\nThe PSUs tie 100% of each of Messrs.\nSolomon\u2019s, Waldron\u2019s and Scherr\u2019s annual\nequity-based compensation to ongoing\nperformance metrics.\n\nThese compensation amounts reflect the\npreviously announced decision by the Board of\nDirectors to reduce 2020 compensation that\nwould otherwise have been paid to Messrs.\nSolomon, Waldron and Scherr by $10 million, $7\nmillion and $7 million, respectively, as part\nof the Board\u2019s broader determination regarding\nthe compensation of certain past and current\nmembers of senior management in light of the\nfindings of the government and regulatory\ninvestigations and the magnitude of the firm\u2019s\nsettlement of government and regulatory\nmatters relating to 1Malaysia Development\nBerhad (\u201c1MDB\u201d). While none of Messrs.\nSolomon, Waldron or Scherr was involved in or\naware of the firm\u2019s participation in any\nillicit activity at the time the firm arranged\nthe 1MDB bond transactions, the Board views\nthe 1MDB matter as an institutional failure,\ninconsistent with the high expectations it has\nfor the firm.\n\nThe Compensation Committee was guided in its\ndetermination of 2020 compensation by, among\nother things, the firm\u2019s Performance\nAssessment Framework, which is comprised of\nidentified financial performance metrics as\nwell as non-financial factors (i.e., client\norientation; risk management; and leadership,\nculture and values). To this end, in making\n2020 compensation decisions, the Compensation\nCommittee considered these factors as well as,\namong other things, the firm\u2019s strong\nperformance in successfully navigating an\nunexpected and volatile operating backdrop to\nmeet the needs of clients \u2013 driving the firm\u2019s\nhighest full-year net revenues in more than a\ndecade \u2013 and solid early progress in executing\non all three pillars of the firm\u2019s strategic\ngoals, as well as Messrs. Solomon\u2019s, Waldron\u2019s\nand Scherr\u2019s outstanding individual\nperformance, including each of their\nleadership in guiding the firm to achieve\nthese results.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the\nRegistrant reported net revenues of $44.6\nbillion, diluted earnings per common share of\n$24.74 and return on average common\nshareholders\u2019 equity of 11.1%, as well as book\nvalue per share growth of 8.1%.\n                                              \n                  SIGNATURE                   \n                                              \nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly\ncaused this report to be signed on its behalf\nby the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.\n                                              \n  Date:              THE GOLDMAN  (Registra\u2026  \n  January\u00a0           SACHS        /s/ Karen   \n  26,\u00a02021      By:  GROUP, INC.
